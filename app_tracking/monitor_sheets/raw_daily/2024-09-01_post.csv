0,1f6ip6t,AITA for telling my sister I can't attend her wedding anymore because she refuses to see me as a boy and because she won't let me bring my girlfriend?,"I (22M) am ftm transgender. My sister (24F) is getting married in early 2025, and she asked me to be her maid of honour. Of course, in the moment, I said yes, and have been calling myself several different versions of this over the past few months (for example, bro of honour, dude of honour, etc).

For backstory, I came out as transgender in my early teens but have only started transitioning from the age of 18 to the present day. She's never really seen me as anything other than her sister, and I've respected that, as I have with most of my family, because I know it can be tough to adjust to something like that. Although, out of all the family members I have, she's never even attempted to call me by the new name or refer to me as her brother.

Originally, when I spoke to her, I asked her two things; if I was okay to bring a plus one (my girlfriend) and if it was alright for me to wear a suit. She said yes to both of these things.

Over time, these things have changed. At first, it was that she wanted me to wear a dress so I ""didnt stand out from the rest of the bridesmaids"" and she ""didn't want me outdoing her fianc√© with my suit"". I have no issue wearing a dress, even though it would make me uncomfortable because I didn't want to disappoint her or ruin her day. I offered to wear it for the ceremony, and then I could change into a suit or smart casual for the rest of the wedding so that I would be more comfortable.

Then she told me about a month or so ago that she wasn't sure if she wanted my girlfriend there because she had never met her, even though I had offered to bring my girlfriend to meet her months before the wedding. (My girlfriend lives abroad, so when she last visited I had offered to take her and myself to see my sister, but my sister never responded to my message, and I don't drive, so I never went.)

I realised that I've been saying yes to her to keep her happy, but not being able to bring my girlfriend tipped me over the edge. I was already going to be uncomfortable around family I didn't like, in an outfit I'd hate, so I wanted someone with me to keep me grounded.

I ended up telling her that I realised I don't fit her idea of what she wanted in her wedding, and that I felt as if I shouldn't attend, even though I really wanted to because it wouldn't be her perfect day if I was included. I think I was an asshole for telling her this like half a year before the wedding, but I just blew up and essentially told her I wasn't coming if I couldn't have my girlfriend with me. I tried to explain to her that I've said yes to things because I want to keep her happy, but now she's being bitchy at me and refusing to even attempt to make conversation.

She ended up calling me a spoiled brat and that our mum had coddled me into thinking I could demand things of her. Her fianc√© chimed in saying that me telling her that I didn't think I was going to go was blackmail, even though I made it perfectly clear I had no intention of blackmailing anyone.

I probably should've been nicer about the way I responded or just been straight up with her at the beginning, and I think it makes me the asshole for not saying anything straight away.

1,1f6hrwe,AITA for telling my friend's girlfriend that I hung out with my friend's parents?,"My best friend and I were neighbors and we grew up together. So I know her parents well. Her parents were in town for a few days and I  had dinner with them. 

Three of us (friend, gf and I) were hanging out together and I mentioned meeting her mom. So she hadn't told her that her parents were visiting at all and she was upset about it. I defended my friend and said she had no obligation to introduce her to her parents. Her girlfriend seemed upset about it but didn't say much. She is kinda sensitive about this because she is a trans woman. 

My friend is really mad at me and said I was really stupid to say that and now her girlfriend has pushed back plans to move in together and my friend is mad that I cost her so much money.

3,1f671vv,"AITA Monthly Open Forum September 2024: Rule 5, Part Deux","#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

After a couple months of some variety, we‚Äôre returning to a deep dive on some of our rules. [We‚Äôve touched upon rule 5 before,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tunibp/aita_monthly_open_forum_april_2022/) but it‚Äôs something that comes up often enough that we felt it was time to revisit.

But before we get to that, let‚Äôs review the core element of this rule: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even *mention* violence.‚Äù That is it. We are *VERY* strict on this rule, for good reason. We have found all too often that violence in a post or comment begets violence in subsequent comments. A post with a seemingly innocuous ‚Äúthen she gently shoved me aside, causing me to trip a little‚Äù leads to ‚ÄúI would punch her‚Äù to the always fun to read ‚ÄúI‚Äôd take my broadsword and cut‚Ä¶.‚Äù I‚Äôll let your imagination fill in the rest. As hyperbolic as that may seem, we really do see comments like that.  Remember - this is Reddit. Folks like to one-up the previous commenter. 

We also do not permit censoring the violence, because let‚Äôs face it - that‚Äôs still mentioning violence. We don‚Äôt do what other sites do, allowing phrases like ‚Äúsewerslide, grape/r*pe/rpe, unalive them, DV, KYS‚Äù and similar. Because that‚Äôs not moderation - that‚Äôs just filtering words to look like you‚Äôre doing something. We do not permit violence in posts or comments. Period.

This also applies to rephrasing attempts. Saying (rule 5), announcing you can't say what you'd do due to sub rules, or alluding to someone ‚Äúneeding an ambulance/hospital‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting arrested or sent to jail"" and similar still break the rule.

Now‚Ä¶let‚Äôs drill down on some specific elements that may not immediately come to mind when one thinks of our ‚ÄúNo Violence‚Äù rule, but still count.

* Food tampering
* Aggressive animals
* Property damage
* Drunk driving
* Corporal punishment
 
Yes, messing with someone‚Äôs food counts. There can be serious consequences for doing so. Someone allergic to peanuts that falls victim to a ‚Äúprank‚Äù can face a life-threatening situation. And posts about eating off someone‚Äôs plate can lead to real fun comments. I can‚Äôt count how many times a food post has led to ‚Äúfork-stab‚Äù comments (which do violate the rule).

Yes, that reactive dog that nips at visitor‚Äôs heels when they come over counts. The same goes for animal on animal violence. I love all animals, but I‚Äôd (rule 5) to protect my cat from an aggressive animal (see how easy that is?). 

Property damage also counts. The ex who smashes your X-Box is destroying property and can easily elicit revenge comments that can go extreme pretty quick. Punching holes in a wall out of anger is also under the rule 5 umbrella.

Next, we have drunk driving. I truly don‚Äôt believe it needs to be explained how this falls under rule 5. There are plenty of videos and stories out there that can explain this better than I could. Throw it in your Google Machine if you need examples. 

Finally, corporal punishment - spanking a child is violence. We‚Äôre not here to debate parenting styles, and whether it is right or wrong to spank/smack your child. Even if you were ‚Äúsmacked around‚Äù as a child and you feel that it set you straight. The bottom line is for the purposes of this sub, corporal punishment is violence.

So what happens when we see violence in the sub? As stated, we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence. Per rule 5, a post that mentions or hints at violence cannot be shared here, and will be removed. Trying to circumvent filters will earn a ban. Comments containing violence are removed and a ban is issued.

#**FINAL, UNRELATED NOTE!**

Eagle-eyed readers may notice a new rule as of last week - #15. It‚Äôs not exactly a rule, but we've added a specific call out to our FAQs. Rules on the sidebar have a character limit. While we try to capture the spirit of the rule within that limit, sometimes the devil's in the details and the details are in the FAQ. Our report reason for rule 15 is fairly self explanatory and we‚Äôve already seen it used a few times!
