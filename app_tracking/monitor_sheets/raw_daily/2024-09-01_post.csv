0,1f6ip6t,AITA for telling my sister I can't attend her wedding anymore because she refuses to see me as a boy and because she won't let me bring my girlfriend?,"I (22M) am ftm transgender. My sister (24F) is getting married in early 2025, and she asked me to be her maid of honour. Of course, in the moment, I said yes, and have been calling myself several different versions of this over the past few months (for example, bro of honour, dude of honour, etc).

For backstory, I came out as transgender in my early teens but have only started transitioning from the age of 18 to the present day. She's never really seen me as anything other than her sister, and I've respected that, as I have with most of my family, because I know it can be tough to adjust to something like that. Although, out of all the family members I have, she's never even attempted to call me by the new name or refer to me as her brother.

Originally, when I spoke to her, I asked her two things; if I was okay to bring a plus one (my girlfriend) and if it was alright for me to wear a suit. She said yes to both of these things.

Over time, these things have changed. At first, it was that she wanted me to wear a dress so I ""didnt stand out from the rest of the bridesmaids"" and she ""didn't want me outdoing her fianc√© with my suit"". I have no issue wearing a dress, even though it would make me uncomfortable because I didn't want to disappoint her or ruin her day. I offered to wear it for the ceremony, and then I could change into a suit or smart casual for the rest of the wedding so that I would be more comfortable.

Then she told me about a month or so ago that she wasn't sure if she wanted my girlfriend there because she had never met her, even though I had offered to bring my girlfriend to meet her months before the wedding. (My girlfriend lives abroad, so when she last visited I had offered to take her and myself to see my sister, but my sister never responded to my message, and I don't drive, so I never went.)

I realised that I've been saying yes to her to keep her happy, but not being able to bring my girlfriend tipped me over the edge. I was already going to be uncomfortable around family I didn't like, in an outfit I'd hate, so I wanted someone with me to keep me grounded.

I ended up telling her that I realised I don't fit her idea of what she wanted in her wedding, and that I felt as if I shouldn't attend, even though I really wanted to because it wouldn't be her perfect day if I was included. I think I was an asshole for telling her this like half a year before the wedding, but I just blew up and essentially told her I wasn't coming if I couldn't have my girlfriend with me. I tried to explain to her that I've said yes to things because I want to keep her happy, but now she's being bitchy at me and refusing to even attempt to make conversation.

She ended up calling me a spoiled brat and that our mum had coddled me into thinking I could demand things of her. Her fianc√© chimed in saying that me telling her that I didn't think I was going to go was blackmail, even though I made it perfectly clear I had no intention of blackmailing anyone.

I probably should've been nicer about the way I responded or just been straight up with her at the beginning, and I think it makes me the asshole for not saying anything straight away.

3,1f671vv,"AITA Monthly Open Forum September 2024: Rule 5, Part Deux","#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

After a couple months of some variety, we‚Äôre returning to a deep dive on some of our rules. [We‚Äôve touched upon rule 5 before,](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tunibp/aita_monthly_open_forum_april_2022/) but it‚Äôs something that comes up often enough that we felt it was time to revisit.

But before we get to that, let‚Äôs review the core element of this rule: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even *mention* violence.‚Äù That is it. We are *VERY* strict on this rule, for good reason. We have found all too often that violence in a post or comment begets violence in subsequent comments. A post with a seemingly innocuous ‚Äúthen she gently shoved me aside, causing me to trip a little‚Äù leads to ‚ÄúI would punch her‚Äù to the always fun to read ‚ÄúI‚Äôd take my broadsword and cut‚Ä¶.‚Äù I‚Äôll let your imagination fill in the rest. As hyperbolic as that may seem, we really do see comments like that.  Remember - this is Reddit. Folks like to one-up the previous commenter. 

We also do not permit censoring the violence, because let‚Äôs face it - that‚Äôs still mentioning violence. We don‚Äôt do what other sites do, allowing phrases like ‚Äúsewerslide, grape/r*pe/rpe, unalive them, DV, KYS‚Äù and similar. Because that‚Äôs not moderation - that‚Äôs just filtering words to look like you‚Äôre doing something. We do not permit violence in posts or comments. Period.

This also applies to rephrasing attempts. Saying (rule 5), announcing you can't say what you'd do due to sub rules, or alluding to someone ‚Äúneeding an ambulance/hospital‚Äù or ‚Äúgetting arrested or sent to jail"" and similar still break the rule.

Now‚Ä¶let‚Äôs drill down on some specific elements that may not immediately come to mind when one thinks of our ‚ÄúNo Violence‚Äù rule, but still count.

* Food tampering
* Aggressive animals
* Property damage
* Drunk driving
* Corporal punishment
 
Yes, messing with someone‚Äôs food counts. There can be serious consequences for doing so. Someone allergic to peanuts that falls victim to a ‚Äúprank‚Äù can face a life-threatening situation. And posts about eating off someone‚Äôs plate can lead to real fun comments. I can‚Äôt count how many times a food post has led to ‚Äúfork-stab‚Äù comments (which do violate the rule).

Yes, that reactive dog that nips at visitor‚Äôs heels when they come over counts. The same goes for animal on animal violence. I love all animals, but I‚Äôd (rule 5) to protect my cat from an aggressive animal (see how easy that is?). 

Property damage also counts. The ex who smashes your X-Box is destroying property and can easily elicit revenge comments that can go extreme pretty quick. Punching holes in a wall out of anger is also under the rule 5 umbrella.

Next, we have drunk driving. I truly don‚Äôt believe it needs to be explained how this falls under rule 5. There are plenty of videos and stories out there that can explain this better than I could. Throw it in your Google Machine if you need examples. 

Finally, corporal punishment - spanking a child is violence. We‚Äôre not here to debate parenting styles, and whether it is right or wrong to spank/smack your child. Even if you were ‚Äúsmacked around‚Äù as a child and you feel that it set you straight. The bottom line is for the purposes of this sub, corporal punishment is violence.

So what happens when we see violence in the sub? As stated, we have a zero tolerance policy when it comes to violence. Per rule 5, a post that mentions or hints at violence cannot be shared here, and will be removed. Trying to circumvent filters will earn a ban. Comments containing violence are removed and a ban is issued.

#**FINAL, UNRELATED NOTE!**

Eagle-eyed readers may notice a new rule as of last week - #15. It‚Äôs not exactly a rule, but we've added a specific call out to our FAQs. Rules on the sidebar have a character limit. While we try to capture the spirit of the rule within that limit, sometimes the devil's in the details and the details are in the FAQ. Our report reason for rule 15 is fairly self explanatory and we‚Äôve already seen it used a few times!

6,1f6s754,AITAH for leaving my(20F) boyfriend (20M) with security during a concert while he was having a bad trip?,"Hey there! In April or March(not sure when), I bought tickets to a concert from an artist that I've been listening to for about 10 years now. I've been looking forward to this even for a long time and bought 2 tickets. I had no idea who wanted to go with at the time, because don't have a lot of friends who listen to that same artist. A month or so goes by and started dating my boyfriend. By July had decided to bring him, even though he didn't particularly like the band. My younger sisters, 17F and 15F heard we were going to this concert and also decided they wanted to go. They bought their own tickets so we all just carpooled. 

At the beginning of the concert my two sisters and my boyfriend all each took one tab of acid. I don't really do psychs, but knew they all had done them many many many times before so trusted them to be okay during the concert. After the first two opening acts my boyfriend started peaking. The crowd and noise was making him bug out so he wandered around to get fresh air and get away from the crowd. My sister's were completely fine and vibing at our spot. But they're minors so didn't like leaving them alone for extended periods during the concert. And because it was an outdoor concert and I didn't want our stuff stolen if they didn't watch it. 

About two songs into the main act my boyfriend calls me freaking out, he had left the main gate and was talking to security. This venue had a strict no re-entry policy, since he had left the gate he could not come back in.  I met up with security at the gate and they told me that they're having EMS check him out on site. But not taking him to a hospital. They said that they wanted to make sure he would have someone to get him from the hospital or PD if he got erratic and had to be taken to either of those places. figured that he is already tripping and there's nothing we can really do to stop that. I didn't want to make my sister's trip go bad, leave them alone for extended periods, or ruin the concert for them by making them leave right when it started. As well as I've been looking forward to this event for months.

When the concert was done, we got all of our things and made it to the front gates. He was still having a bad trip but he had an officer with him keeping him company. When he saw me he gave me a big lift up hug and we all left to go home. He was tripping from 7pm to 10am. Security said that was abandoning him, older sister said was a horrible person. He said he didn't really care either way(will ask more when he gets up tonight). I personally feel terrible about it, but at the same time feel like it isn't exactly my responsibility as he's an adult, and he said he would be okay to do this at the concert.

So AITAH? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-01,"AITAH for leaving my(20F) boyfriend (20M) with security during a concert while he was having a bad trip? Hey there! In April or March(not sure when), I bought tickets to a concert from an artist that I've been listening to for about 10 years now. I've been looking forward to this even for a long time and bought 2 tickets. I had no idea who wanted to go with at the time, because don't have a lot of friends who listen to that same artist. A month or so goes by and started dating my boyfriend. By July had decided to bring him, even though he didn't particularly like the band. My younger sisters, 17F and 15F heard we were going to this concert and also decided they wanted to go. They bought their own tickets so we all just carpooled. 

At the beginning of the concert my two sisters and my boyfriend all each took one tab of acid. I don't really do psychs, but knew they all had done them many many many times before so trusted them to be okay during the concert. After the first two opening acts my boyfriend started peaking. The crowd and noise was making him bug out so he wandered around to get fresh air and get away from the crowd. My sister's were completely fine and vibing at our spot. But they're minors so didn't like leaving them alone for extended periods during the concert. And because it was an outdoor concert and I didn't want our stuff stolen if they didn't watch it. 

About two songs into the main act my boyfriend calls me freaking out, he had left the main gate and was talking to security. This venue had a strict no re-entry policy, since he had left the gate he could not come back in.  I met up with security at the gate and they told me that they're having EMS check him out on site. But not taking him to a hospital. They said that they wanted to make sure he would have someone to get him from the hospital or PD if he got erratic and had to be taken to either of those places. figured that he is already tripping and there's nothing we can really do to stop that. I didn't want to make my sister's trip go bad, leave them alone for extended periods, or ruin the concert for them by making them leave right when it started. As well as I've been looking forward to this event for months.

Before I have birth, she got pregnant again with her second boy, and I completely forgot about the girl name after that because it wasn't relevant anymore (at that point she was only planning to have two kids).

3 years later, I've just had my second baby, a little girl. My friend moved overseas almost 2 years ago, and while we still talk, it's not like we used to. We decided on our baby's first and middle name around the halfway point in pregnancy again.

 Jack asked my dad what his ideal birthday celebration would look like. My dad is a pretty reserved guy and doesn‚Äôt like crowds of people. My dad said that he would love if all his children were celebrating with him.

For context I live about 7 hours away in a different city, and Anne lives with her bf since she was 18. Jack also travels a lot for his job. Time kinda flew by and my mother and I had started planning more specifically (my brother will be away for his job unfortunately). All activities will happen over the span of two days, and are all activities that my dad enjoys. 

My mom and I decided called my sister to inform her of the plans and ask if she would like to add something and if the times work for her, to which she replied that it sounds fun. She said that her bf (22M) will be coming along. I apologised for the miscommunication but we were clear that my dad just wanted his kids with him and that her bf can join on Saturday evening when we will be baking the cake. She started yelling at me that this is because of what I want and it‚Äôs because I never liked him so I want to distance him from the family. Additional info: In the beginning of their relationship I advised her that it isn‚Äôt a great idea to move in with him 2 months after they started dating (he still lives with his parents).

15,1f6ps3e,AITA For Calling Out My Sister's Boyfriend?,"I (27M) don't find it easy to get along with my younger sister's bf (26M). 

We live in different states but last night we were gaming, one of the few things we can bond over. We're playing a game that I usually beat him at, but he wanted to play. He gets very frustrated when he's losing, yelling at the TV, saying things like this game sucks, that I'm lucky etc.

I asked if he wanted some advice to get better at the game. He replied ""You never take my advice so no, I don't want it.""

A little background: he lives at my sister's apartment (25), doesn't have a driver's license, job hops, has no credit, and lashes out at me when I try and give advice (see above). He often tries to ""big brother"" me on topics that he has little to no knowledge on. It usually starts with me making an objective observation and him chiming in with ""no it doesn't work like that, trust me,"" and he has no evidence to backup his claims. My sis says he probably has oppositional defiance disorder, which she shared with me today after this argument. 

Well last night after he said I never take his advice, I got frustrated with him being a baby. Part of this was trash talk, but partially I wanted to see how realistic he is with himself and his situation, since he talks a lot of shit to me. This is where I think I might be the asshole: I said ""I own my home, my car, and I've had a great career. What advice could you possibly give me?""

He immediately shut the game off, texted me saying that I showed my true colors and he always had a suspicion that I think I'm better. Telling me to stop acting like I have nothing to learn from him, I'm an air head with a god complex, that he's seen me at my worst, that my career success is because I caught a ""lucky break"", that he was dealt a better hand with women and that's why I'm single and I could learn from him, and that I don't treat him as an equal so he'll never take advice from me.

I constantly tried to reel the conversation in. I told him I don't think I'm a better person, just realistically there are things I'm better at than him and he lashes out at me and makes excuses instead of acknowledging it. I told him that I have room to grow too, just like he does. And it's not even about money, moreso about emotional maturity, then I gave him examples. To which he responded that I'm an egotistical prick, that's why women will fuck me but won't love me. 

I told him ""I've been in this family for 27 years, you've been here five. My respect is earned, and you haven't earned it. You and I are going to be as friendly as you make it. If you're a winey bitch, I'm going to treat you like one. If you're cool, we'll be cool. You play nice with the side of my family that helps you survive, and you don't respect the rest of us - even your parents who you cut off. I pray that you prove me wrong but you're on thin ice with me. Play your role.""

I definitely said some asshole things, but AITA for checking him?

We have a few rules tho, such as: we can‚Äôt turn off the camera, we can‚Äôt turn off the mic, we can‚Äôt be in our beds or slouching around and so on. 

Anyways there‚Äôs this one dude in my class let‚Äôs call him Peter, i can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm a fan, he‚Äôs very obnoxious and childish. He keeps interrupting the teacher and the students, he goes on long rants about personal stuff no one asked him about and he‚Äôs very rude, i can‚Äôt count on one hand the sexist and fat phobic jokes he makes in a day. 

If he was a kid or a teenager, honestly‚Ä¶. I might let some of this slide, but **this man is 37**.

At the end of each session, like the last 5 mins or so, we play a game of kahoot. Usually, about the lesson we just had that day, it‚Äôs pretty much standard procedure. Peter is weirdly extremely competitive during this game, he has to win first place no matter what. He would yell out wrong answers, keep talking to distract people, cheat (allegedly, i can‚Äôt know lol). Long story short he‚Äôs been insufferable, which is nothing out of the ordinary. 


During the last kahoot game, I came first, which is a surprise even for me, because I made quite few mistakes. Peter throws a tantrum, he claims the game is rigged, I must‚Äôve been cheating, and finally the one I found most funny ‚ÄúI have more correct answers than op, she just won because she answered faster, therefore I‚Äôm better at German‚Äù. Tbh the last declaration felt like something my little brother would say, i couldn‚Äôt help rolling my eyes and chuckling and I told Peter ‚Äúyou‚Äôre too old for this shit‚Äù. 

Peter found this very offensive, not my comment, but the eye roll and the laugh, he insisted I apologize, I told him to pound sand. Everyone was on my side initially but then idk if Peter wore them down or if they actually found me to be rude but they told me to just apologize so we can move past this, I still said no. 

Now I‚Äôm doubting my decision, not for Peter, screw Peter. I just worry he would throw a lot of tantrums in retaliation and it would ruin the class for my other classmates and our teachers. I always knew he‚Äôs childish and a piece of work, maybe it would have been better if I said sorry and not ruined the atmosphere with an argument. 

So AITA?

She had her son at 19 and never married his father. The dad lives in another state now and sees his son for a weekend every month. My fianc√© married her now ex-husband when her son was 4 and separated when he was 8. They've been divorced for 6 years. 

Despite this her son still spends a lot of time with her ex-husband. There are no overnights (other than camping trips) but altogether they are spending a couple days a month together. 

I am not entirely happy with these circumstances. I know it sounds awful to say that but it's how I'm feeling. For two years I've tried to bond with this boy but he's hellbent on not accepting me as his future stepfather. Whenever, I suggest him and I doing something together he turns me down and every attempt at bonding has failed. I already do so much for him, but he doesn't see me as any more than a chauffeur that gets to tag along.

He already has a dad and a stepdad, so he doesn't see any use for me. This wouldn't be so frustrating if it wasn't for the fact neither of these men prioritise him. He sees his dad only once a month and despite my fianc√©s attempts to increase contact time, he never wants to see any more of his son. 

The former stepdad is similar story. Sure, he already does more than he technically needs to, but multiple times his stepson has asked him to come to something school/sport related in the last year and has been turned down. 

I recently opened up to my fianc√© about how I'm feeling, and she seemed to understand where I was coming from. However, when I brought up that I think she should start reducing how much time her ex spends with her son, she told me she wouldn't and that I was being an asshole to even ask. We ended up fighting about it for an hour.

When I told my friends what had happened, they agreed with her and told me I was being an asshole. The ex-stepdad only takes her son when it's convenient to him and he needs someone to come to a basketball game with him, he's never there when it counts.

26,1f6okuc,AITA for enforcing the move-out date of someone I took in?,"My partner Jack (22 NB) and I (21 F) took in someone we'll call Grace (21 F). Grace and Jack went to high school together but weren‚Äôt close. Grace has been texting Jack every few months for the past five years with troubling thoughts and plans. Jack has learned to set boundaries, but Grace doesn‚Äôt respect them.

Grace was living with an abusive family when she said she would be homeless and might harm herself over it. Concerned, Jack and I offered her a place to stay for two months. However, Grace kept extending her stay by about three months each time. We live in a one-bedroom apartment, and the leasing office noticed Grace‚Äôs extended stay. They've given us until October to have her move out. When we informed Grace, she did not take it well and responded by crying in front of our fridge, which has effectively held our kitchen hostage.

Grace doesn‚Äôt have her own space due to our small apartment, but we set up a bed for her in the living room. Despite this, she doesn‚Äôt respond to our attempts to communicate and continues to engage in concerning behavior including threats towards her wellbeing
  
Several issues have arisen:

1. Comments on Food: Despite knowing I have a history of disordered eating, Grace continually comments on what I‚Äôm eating.

2. Lack of Independence: Grace frequently asks what ‚Äúwe‚Äù will be having for every meal. When I tell her that Jack and I will handle our own meals, she simply skips eating. She refuses to cook and I must constantly prompt her to do her laundry.

3. Conflicting Information and Lies: Grace has given conflicting information about herself and us. EX: When Jack confronted her about a hurtful comment she made about my food, Grace denied it and accused us of lying.

4. Lack of Effort: Grace has made minimal effort to find work or secure an apartment. She only applies to very specific jobs and has saved about $5,000 but hasn‚Äôt been proactive in finding work or a new place.

I also have Obsessive-Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD) and other issues, which make it hard to manage the mess in our apartment. It‚Äôs overwhelming for me, and I struggle with having a cluttered space. Additionally, Jack and I value our privacy, and Grace‚Äôs behavior has made this difficult.

However I‚Äôve met him a few times and I don‚Äôt exactly hold favourable opinions of him. I didn‚Äôt tell my friend because I wasn‚Äôt fully sure of my views yet and I didn‚Äôt want to be negative. 

Anyway he‚Äôs throwing a party soon and invited my friend, he asked her to bring me along too. He said it was a themed party and that everyone would be assigned a character/style to wear. He sent my friend a picture of our outfits: two skimpy as hell maid costumes sprawled on a bed. 

I immediately told her that I wouldn‚Äôt be wearing that shit and especially not to a party with a bunch of strangers. Initially she thought I was kidding but then understood that I‚Äôm serious. 

She said that wearing these fits isn‚Äôt a big deal at all and that I need to stop being so ‚Äúprudish and serious‚Äù.

I asked her if she seriously sees nothing wrong with it and she said no. She explained that he just has a weird taste and that it might be a weird rich people thing. 

I told her again that I will not be wearing some skimpy ass maid costume. Not only is it embarrassing, it is especially disrespectful to me because I don‚Äôt have any sort of meaningful relationship with the guy and yet he thought it‚Äôs appropriate to include me in this request. 

I told her that I won‚Äôt be wearing the clothes, won‚Äôt be going to the party and will from now on avoid her new bf altogether.

I do try to get along with him, it's just a little awkward. I am surprised they're friends, they seem like opposites, but they are really close. I do think my bf could do better, but that's who he wants as a best friend.

But anyway, it was his bff's birthday and we went on vacation. His friend wanted to go on a hike, so we took him.

I work out, so I wasn't out of sweat or breathing hard at all. Neither was my bf. But his bff was. He was gasping for air and we had to keep stopping for him to rest up. I kept trying to get us to keep going but my bf kept telling me to stop. But we're on vacation and I wanted to get back to the city so we could walk around, have fun, etc.

So yeah, I was annoyed and trying to get his bff to hurry along. At one point, I was at a rest stop on the trail, waiting for them to catch up. His friend finally shows up. I get up and said ""Ok, let's go. Let's hurry up.""

32,1f6mvx9,AITA For Leaving An Honest Review On My Friend's Debut Novel?,"I don't want anyone to be able to find the novel, so I will try to be vague. All I will say regarding the novel's details is that I primarily read high fantasy and sci-fi, while my friend's novel is a romance. I am also reading an ARC, as the novel has not yet been released. I'm going to call my author friend ""Anne"".

So I (25F) am part of an online reading/writing group of about 30 people. One of the members, who has become a friend of mine, is Anne (26F). She is the only member that lives near me and we meet for coffee sometimes. We share book recommendations, writing tips, etc etc. Even though we aren't interested in reading or writing the same genres most of the time, we get along pretty well. Anne has been working on her debut novel for the past couple of years and is finally getting published. She's very excited to say the least, and got ARCs two months ago to give to friends and family. She even had one sent to an author whose name is pretty popular right now, and said that it was her writing that inspired this novel. I honestly didn't expect to get an ARC. I felt that there was no way to politely turn her down seeing as we were friends, so I took the book.

Anne put a card in my ARC (and I'm assuming everyone else's) asking that I visit the Goodreads page for her book, leave an honest review, and promote her book on our socials. After I finally read it, I went to Goodreads, found the page for her book, and started typing. I gave her three stars, and I said that while I wasn't the target audience, it was a sweet story that fans of the genre would love, and it could just use a bit of tweaking. The day after I posted that review, I woke up to missed calls and texts from Anne. They ranged from angry to sad, all asking how/why I could ""do this to her"". I called her up and asked what was going on, and she immediately launched into a ran about how I'm a terrible friend and terrible fellow author to leave such a poor review on her book and asked if I was trying to hurt her career. I told her I wasn't trying to hurt her career and that she asked for an honest review, so I left an honest review. She continued to berate me, and I was so tired and caught off guard that I just hung up on her. This happened last Wednesday.

Yesterday I got back in touch with her to have a calm, adult conversation with her about it, but it didn't take long for her to get angry again and demand what I didn't like about her book. I told her that it just wasn't the kind of thing I was into, and that she knew that when she gave me the ARC. She got angrier and yelled at me that it doesn't matter and that ""as my friend and fellow author, you should have left me a five star review. What you did was so shitty and backhanded and you're a major asshole, ESPECIALLY since it's my first"". She told the group that we're in, leaving the entire thing in upheaval and everyone is divided. Was I TA?

EDIT: I'm getting some similar questions/responses in the comments, so I'm adding this for clarity. I do not hate the romance genre (I've read a few romances that I like, I just find myself not enjoying romance books more often than not) and I did not rate Anne's book just because it's romance or just because it wasn't my cup of tea. Saying ""I'm not the target audience"" was just the nicest way I could think to say that I personally didn't enjoy the book. I gave it three stars because the writing wasn't very good, especially during the ""spice"", and some of the side characters were poorly written. Had that not been the case, I would've given her book four stars easily. The only reason I left a review at all instead of simply not doing so was because I felt a lot of pressure due to 1) the note she left in my copy about leaving an honest review and promoting her book, 2) the fact that she frequently asks for updates in the writing/reading group we're in about if people have finished their ARC and why they haven't left a review yet. I thought not leaving a review or refusing to leave one would just result in more questioning and prodding until I did it.

EDIT 2: A user pointed out that they weren't familiar with the acronym ARC and asked what it meant, so I thought I'd add the explanation here as well for anyone else who's unfamiliar. ARC stands for Advanced Readers Copy. It is a pre-publication copy of the book that the author sends out to readers (other authors in their genre, friends and family, long time fans, influencers) a few months ahead of the book's actual publication. ARCs are sent out so the writer can get early reviews and feedback and make last minute changes to their book before it gets printed and shipped to booksellers. You could say it's similar to how students sometimes have a peer/instructor/tutor/etc proof read an essay a couple days before they turn it in so they can make some tweaks before handing it over to their professor. Some authors use it as a way to create hype pre-publication by sending it to friends and family and expecting lots of good reviews in return to boost their rating, which I'm coming to understand is what Anne might have actually been expecting from me.",Asshole,2024-09-01,"AITA For Leaving An Honest Review On My Friend's Debut Novel?

When I asked her why she did Not Tell me so that I could have Run Back (to at least lower the damage) she Just Said that shencraved the bakery goods.

My Last Straw was when i tried to dry everything and she Just laid in her bed. When i lent a Hair dryer from the Hostel Personal she was pissed about the noise and Heat, but i did Not Stop.

When she grumbled I lashed Out on her, that I thought her behavior was Something of a Woman in her Midlife-Crisis wanting to experience her wannabee-cool-moment. After I dryed my bed i went Out to get myself a Cup of tea, when i got back she was asleep..

The next day she behaved as If nothing Had happened...

I am Not Sure If I reacted the right way in the end it was her decision, but the consequences affected me too.. was i wrong to lecture her?",0.0,0.06141959875822067,0,1

Kiddo (20NB, they/them) turns 21 in the upcoming week and hubs went out today to pick up a card for them. Normally hubs is GREAT at card selection.

He came back with this though.

https://imgur.com/a/5RZOBMg

Honestly the tone of it just confused the hell out of me. My reaction was light-hearted like ""unusual choice but okay"" but he could tell it was sitting weird with me and he asked me about it.

I told him it's a really sweet sentiment but the tone makes it sound like this is for a distant cousin or something. There's no parental vibes, no 21st excitement vibes, not even ""we live in the same house"" vibes üòÇ. Idk it's just warm in like a weirdly professional way to me if that makes sense? Like if I received this I wouldn't expect it to be from a parent, unless we were low contact.

But yeah. So I laughed about it a bit and he took it good naturedly but I can tell he's bummed. And I feel bad for hurting his feelings about it.

Trying to decide if I was just unfairly harsh because it's just a card and it doesn't even matter, or if this actually *is* a little weird tonally & maybe we should get a new card. AITA?

It‚Äôs not just about the film, but knowing so much about me and she still forces me to do things i don‚Äôt enjoy. Every film she wants us to watch with her is war related which i obviously don‚Äôt like, and always the longest films but today has just really upset me as i feel like she doesn‚Äôt actually take anything i say into consideration.

I‚Äôve told her for years that I don‚Äôt like certain vegetables and she still will try and shove it in my face. 
I‚Äôve told her I don‚Äôt like skinny jeans for ages, and she still only buys me skinny jeans (as presents). 
I don‚Äôt like war films etc and she always wants to force me to watch them. These are just some examples but there are so many more. 
I don‚Äôt want to do certain activities etc because of my issues but i‚Äôm still forced to do whatever she wants me to do.

I have a friend of mine whom I met in a mental institution around 5 years ago and we have been friends ever since with some ups and downs. We both suffer from complex trauma but we bond over it and have overall the same morals and values. 

Coming to the issue, I have a severe problem with procrastination to the point I don‚Äôt eat, drink or other things that‚Äôs beneficial to my health. And because I procrastinate, I don‚Äôt want to start something new before doing so. I‚Äôm currently in the process of getting an evaluation for ADD but nothing confirmed yet so I won‚Äôt say I have it yet. Me and my friend have had issues lately due to it.

So whenever she texts me and I don‚Äôt respond back until hours or even days later, she forgets and doesn‚Äôt remember the original reason she texted, which I don‚Äôt fault her for and I don‚Äôt personally have an issue with. 

Lately though, she has gotten extremely irritated at me recently. I don‚Äôt fault her for it, but she knows that I have these issues and I try to communicate with her about it as much as possible that it‚Äôs nothing personal and I do this with everyone and everything. I do acknowledge that it‚Äôs bad of me to promise I‚Äôll call when my phone is done charging and a couple of hours goes by with no response.

I ended up telling her that clearly we don‚Äôt see eye to eye about this and maybe we just need a break until this issue of mine gets resolved. 

There‚Äôs where we stand rn, and I don‚Äôt think my phrasing did the actual situation justice lol.

",TL;DR,2024-09-01,"AITA for telling my friend to stop texting me if she‚Äôs going to keep getting annoyed? This is my first time ever writing on Reddit lol so I hope this isn‚Äôt too awkward. 

I have a friend of mine whom I met in a mental institution around 5 years ago and we have been friends ever since with some ups and downs. We both suffer from complex trauma but we bond over it and have overall the same morals and values. 

Coming to the issue, I have a severe problem with procrastination to the point I don‚Äôt eat, drink or other things that‚Äôs beneficial to my health. And because I procrastinate, I don‚Äôt want to start something new before doing so. I‚Äôm currently in the process of getting an evaluation for ADD but nothing confirmed yet so I won‚Äôt say I have it yet. Me and my friend have had issues lately due to it. She‚Äôs pretty impatient and has bad memory. So whenever she texts me and I don‚Äôt respond back until hours or even days later, she forgets and doesn‚Äôt remember the original reason she texted, which I don‚Äôt fault her for and I don‚Äôt personally have an issue with. 

Lately though, she has gotten extremely irritated at me recently. I don‚Äôt fault her for it, but she knows that I have these issues and I try to communicate with her about it as much as possible that it‚Äôs nothing personal and I do this with everyone and everything. I do acknowledge that it‚Äôs bad of me to promise I‚Äôll call when my phone is done charging and a couple of hours goes by with no response.

47,1f6k5bi,AITA for pulling away from my parents,"
I‚Äôll attempt to keep this as concise as possible 

My wife and I have 3 children all under 9. We and my oldest at the time had a very close relationship with my parents. My mother helped babysit about 2x a week during the school year (my wife is a school nurse) and we always made an effort to show our gratitude. Flights for my mother to see her family, dinners, pedicure appointments- things like that. 

About 4 years ago my sister who now has two children of her own both under 4 experienced the loss of her first unborn child unexpectedly and late in the pregnancy. I was very involved especially from the logistics side to help my sister and brother in law through everything. My parents have always walked on eggshells with my sister her entire life for fear of upsetting her but it was even more so after the tragedy. When she had her children both of my parents went to babysit for her as she ‚Äúexpected‚Äù it (her words). The schedule is 5x week from about 7:30-5. Almost immediately my parents became overwhelmed with the schedule and workload. After one school year of this my wife and I put our children in full day programs. My mother insisted this was not necessary and they were happy to help. I had numerous talks with her that they were clearly being spread thin with everything they‚Äôre doing and that hopefully the time they do spend with my children will be more enjoyable and does not have to feel like work. That was over two years ago and since then my parents have yet to really spend any one on one quality time with any of my kids. My oldest would reach out and ask to spend time and ‚Äúchit chat‚Äù. That request is regularly met with an empty ‚Äúwell see‚Äù or ‚Äúlet‚Äôs pick a good day‚Äù. Many of the events my parents do come to they have my sisters children and it‚Äôs only an opportunity to get them out of the house than to actually spend time with mine. The times they aren‚Äôt babysitting and come are rare and usually leave early due to being tired. When I see my parents watching my sisters children, they are usually somewhat engaging and regularly will take them to their activities and also just let them tagalong when my parents run day to day errands. 

We‚Äôve asked my parents for help for a date night or when schedules conflict and it‚Äôs hit or miss if they can help. The times they do essentially zero quality time is spent with my children. My mother will give the kids her phone and let them play games. My father will have the television tuned to the news at a deafening volume. 

This is all to say over the past couple of years I have pulled away from my parents and unfortunately have harbored resentment toward them and my sister. As I said I‚Äôve had a couple conversations where I‚Äôve tried to gently talk to my mother about spending quality time with my kids. I feel that I‚Äôm at the point where having a 100% honest conversation will only lead to irreparable damage because there is no other way to say they‚Äôre being bad grandparents.

53,1f6jaxi,AITA for expecting my brother to put more effort into looking after his dogs?,"My family had two dogs. A few years ago and I (23M) come home one day. There's a third dog there. I had no idea this was going to happen. My parents were on vacation at the time, and my brother (21M) just told them he was going to get a third dog and they let him do it. He paid the full price for the dog. I didn't know this was happening until I got home one day and there was a third dog in the house. My brother said he'd look after it, as he mostly did with the other two.

Over the next two years, there's been issues. In short, the dog isn't well behaved, including potty training. This has caused multiple arguments between my brother and the rest of the family.

Cut to a few weeks ago. My parents split up and my mother moves out very suddenly. She's no longer able to look after the dogs as she usually did. At essentially the same time, I also move back home full time. Now I was expected to look after the dogs much more. I said I'll do it, but only when my father or brother was unable to (I am still working and finishing up collage).

Very often, my brother asks me to look after them on the day even when he's home because he's tired, usually after he came home from work. As my brother pushed to get the second dog (he split half the cost with my parents) and actively went to get a third dog without telling anyone, I don't think it's fair that I'm expected to look after them when other members of the family (particularly my brother) are home.

The biggest issue by far though is the fact that the third dog STILL isn't potty trained. He leaves a significant amount of mess on the floor multiple times a week, even if the backdoor is left open. I find it disgusting and degrading that I'm cleaning up literal dogshit and dogpiss multiple times a week, and it usually leaves me in a horrible mood for the rest of the day.

My brother has said that if he knew my parents were going to split up, he wouldn't have got a third dog. He also doesn't know what's going to happen with the dogs when he eventually moves out (he's not actively trying to do so at the moment while I'm actively looking at new jobs to try and move out ASAP - I'm not happy living here).

Don't get me wrong, I do love those dogs, but they're a lot of effort and I don't want to spend so much of my time looking after them. I don't think it's my responsibility, and I think feeding or settling them when my brother or father is unable to do so is more than acceptable on my part. My father went along with getting the dogs and didn't say no to it at any point, and my brother actively pushed for and bought two of them. I wasn't a part of the conversation either time.

Don't get me wrong, I do love those dogs, but they're a lot of effort and I don't want to spend so much of my time looking after them. I don't think it's my responsibility, and I think feeding or settling them when my brother or father is unable to do so is more than acceptable on my part. My father went along with getting the dogs and didn't say no to it at any point, and my brother actively pushed for and bought two of them. I wasn't a part of the conversation either time. I think that my brother hoped that our mother and father would look after them, but now there are complications he is unwilling to accept responsibility on his behalf.

Who's the asshole in this situation?",0.0,0.054360680282115936,0,1

I'm a 35-year-old widower with two young daughters, ages 7 and 3. My wife passed away when our youngest was just three months old. I never thought I'd find love again, but two years ago, I met my fianc√©e, a 30-year-old woman who moved to our country for work. She's been incredible, embracing my daughters as her own, and they adore her. I appreciate everything she does for us and admire her deeply.

However, there's a significant issue. My fianc√©e works for a friend she met online 14 years ago. He's her boss, and they have a long history together. I have some suspicions about their relationship, but she insists they're just friends. Her boss has a notorious reputation as a playboy, with two failed marriages and a history of neglecting his children. Despite this, my fianc√©e sees him as a savior because he helped her escape a traumatic past.

My fianc√©e had a very difficult childhood. Her mother abandoned her, her father ended up in jail, and she was adopted by an abusive family. This left her with both physical and emotional scars. Her boss offered her a new life, paying for her therapy, giving her a job, and providing her with a home.

Because of her past trauma, my fianc√©e has taken on a maternal role with her boss‚Äôs children, aged 5 and 2. She been taking care of them since day 1. She feels a strong sense of responsibility to care for them, reflecting her own neglected childhood. Her boss provides for the children financially, but she just need to watch them.

After I proposed, we started discussing our future, including where we would live. I suggested we move into my house, which is smaller but sufficient for the four of us. When I mentioned that I didn‚Äôt want her boss‚Äôs children to be part of our marriage or live with us, the conversation quickly turned into a heated argument. She accused me of being insensitive and failing to understand her bond with these children. And she insisted that her boss only gonna neglected and abandoned his children. Since then, she's been avoiding me, never reply my massage, call or email. she still keeps in touch with my daughters even send her launch.

My brother (34M) has three kids, ages 6,8 and 10. A few months ago, he ask if they could stay at my place for the weekends because he and his wife needed a break, I agreed, thinking it would be nice to bond with my nieces and nephew. 

Well, that weekend turned into a nightmare. The kids went absolutely wild. They broke several things, including a vas that was a gift from my late grandmother, spilled juice on my white couch, and even scribbled on the walls with markers. I tried to manage the situation, but whenever I told them to stop or try to set boundaries, they completely ignored me.

When I told my brother about the damage, he just laughed it off and said, 'Kids will be kids'. He didn't offer to help clean up or replace anything. I was really hurt but didn't make a big deal out of it at the time.

Fast forward to now, he's asking if the kids can stay over again because they want to go on another weekend trip. I told him no, explaining what happened last time and that I don't want to deal with that again. He got really upset, saying I'm punishing his kids for being kids and that I'm being unfair.

Now my parents are involved, saying I should 'be the bigger person' and help out my brother. They say the kids ae sorry and just want to spend time with their aunt. But I'm still traumatized by the last time they were here.

When my sister got pregnant at the aged of 16, I took part of taking care of her baby like a mother caring for her child. I bathe the baby, fed her, be there on her every milestones, and even cried when she cries because her mom was physically hurting her when she gets more time of playing outside than looking after her younger brother.

When she decided to move out and live with her now boyfriend, I asked her to not bring my niece with them since the kid is not a close relative of her boyfriend. We even got into a fight because my niece would not want to go with her. Since she has more rights of the child, I gave in and told her that if something happens to my niece, I will do everything to loose all her rights and I will be the sole guardian of the child.

Sadly, my niece died just 13 days after her 11th birthday. That was the most excruiating moment of my life. Because of what happened, I lost interest of everything. It affects my mental health. Since then, my sister and I have a strained relationship.

57,1f6ipf4,AITA for moving early out of the country,"So I need to know AITA here, this is my first post so bare with me as I figure out how to navigate this I just need advice. 

I have a 15 year old (F) and a 3 year old (F). I work for the US govt and have been offered an overseas position in Zama Japan if I should desire it. To preface, my life long dream since I was very small was to move to Japan. I have family there and another coworker who has already accepted a position in Zama and so moving there was always something I have wanted to do, and it's also a dream I share with my partner. 

My oldest didn't share our vision and wanted to finish out school at her current school so I denied the offer the first time and we decided to stay in the states. Our plan was that I would reapply for the position (as it is almost always hiring) when our oldest graduates high school and then we would relocate then. We let her Know she could come with us after graduation but because she was an adult she would likely not fall under my visa so she would need to get a job of her own quickly to secure her own Visa to stay longer than three months. We told her otherwise she could go to college, whatever she chooses in the states and we would support her decision regardless. My daughter said she didn't like the idea that she would have to work a job she may potentially hate just to maintain a visa  and said she would stay in the states and figure it out. We told her that was fine and I thought the issue was settled. 

Now here's where I want to know if I'm the AH. So my daughter has never been academically inclined. We have done everything we could from tutoring to begging her teachers for extra time to finish her work. I know it sounds like we've spoiled her and we honestly probably have and that's our fault. But since starting high school she's been failing. She's retaking 9th grade this year again and so my daughter has started talking about wanting to drop out and get her GED. I obviously don't want her to drop out but when discussing it with my husband he sounded honestly almost excited at the prospect. He said if she dropped out and got her GED it was a great idea because then we could just go ahead and accept that job offer if it was still on the table and just relocate to Japan. Since the only thing he argues that we were staying for was her to remain in that school.

 Would we be the AH for relocating us all if she drops out and gets her GED? I just feel odd about it all. Advice would be great 

Edit to clarify things I didn't realize: 1.) my daughter would NOT be staying in the states on her own. She would move with us to Japan and live with us there in a home next to or on the base(I haven't looked at their housing setup yet but I know my friend lives a 2 minute walk from base). If she wanted to remain in Japan after she reached an age where she can independently live on her own then that's fine but otherwise she would move with us since us staying revolved around her school.

2.) My daughter would not in any way have to learn Japanese if she didn't want to. The base like I said would be within a very reasonable walking distance. It has everything a modern society has from schools, grocery stores, movie theatres, restaurants, etc. and everyone there would be American and therefore English would be the main language on the base.

Hi all‚ÄîI‚Äôm a college student, and I recently took over the lease on a place on July 1st, though I am not moving into the place until mid-September. This is in a high cost of living area, so I had a subletter (Adrian) stay in the place for July and August. The previous tenant moved out on the last week of June. I believe Adrian began moving in on June 30th. There was another guy who also moved in on July 1st (Jack), and then there is a girl who has been living there for quite some time (Stacy). Stacy collects the rent and utilities each month.

On June 25, Stacy texted me asking if I was going to send her June utilities. I responded in saying that I believe the previous tenant should be responsible for that, since I was taking over for July 1 onwards, but that maybe I could help if it is needed (I wish I hadn‚Äôt said this‚Äîat the time I said it because I wanted to make a good first impression on Stacy since she was a new housemate, but I never really gave a clear yes‚Äîjust a maybe). I texted the previous tenant asking her if she could send June utilities to Stacy, she didn‚Äôt respond. I assumed it was possibly sent since I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about it from Stacy.

Apparently, what happened is when Adrian moved in, Stacy charged him for June utilities, and then for July, and then just now asked him for August. He was confused by this because he was only there for two months and didn‚Äôt realize she had charged him for June; he sent her the difference between June and August, which I thought was perfectly reasonable since he fully paid for the two months he was there for. He messaged me about this and also warned me that Stacy is a bit messy and difficult to deal with, but that Jack was great enough to make up for that, so it was still worth moving into the place this month.

Stacy texted me asking me to send her June utilities ‚Äúas previously agreed‚Äù since the previous tenant did not. It‚Äôs 73. I didn‚Äôt really agree to it before, just said I could maybe help.

I truthfully think she‚Äôs being a bit unreasonable‚ÄîI took over the lease in July; neither Adrian nor I should have to pay for a month we weren‚Äôt there or on the lease for.

In my middle teens I left home. By this time my mother had remarried and had more children. Her husband would step in when he thought she was getting out of hand. He didn't let her touch his kids however.

In my early 20s I left the family. I could not go to events without her being there so I cut everyone off and walked away. My girlfriend now wife and I moved, I changed my name and left. I always dreamed of what I would say if I saw her, how I would get even, what I would like to do, how I would do it.

8 months back my wife got a call. It turns out my grandmother had her phone number still. I was away from home so I got a note: Your mother's dying, she wants to see you, please return this call.

I expected to be angry, I expect to feel hurt again however I found out that after 20 years I understand what ""Time heals all wounds"" meant. While I was not looking time had ebbed away all my rage. I didn't hate her anymore, in its place was just apathy. I guess rage is a younger me's need. Because I remember having an unhealthy attachment to it in my 20s.

I thought about what to do for about a month. I decided to let silence be my answer. I didn't want to see her. 

2 weeks ago my wife gets a photo of the invite to the funeral. I felt like I needed to see it. Just the funeral. I actually thought about asking to see her body, to make sure, but upon reflection I decided that was a step too far. I just needed to see that this was real. Close that chapter.

l arrived late wore black and stood just outside the double doors looking in. A coffin, a photo, my sister crying. It was real but it didn't change anything. I had let my rage die, I didn't need to do this. I could have gone to her grave 2 weeks from now and had the same closure.

As it turns out I have a younger brother born after I left that I had never known about. He's in his teens now and he knew who I was. In the hall, in front of everyone he said if I didn't respect her enough to see her in life I didn't deserve to in her death. There was more said but I can't remember it. I just realised that no one there even knew my name. I was not a part of this family and I didn't belong.

Instead of answering I left. I think my need to see that it was over could have been better served by asking for her plot and visiting in my own time. I thought seeing the funeral would be a moment of closure but I felt the same after as I did before I went. My wife says that my brother is just mourning and I had every right to go.

61,1f6i9ee,AITA for changing my name even though it has significance in my family?,"Hi, I've (19F) changed my name socially recently since I've always hated it. BTW sorry if my English sounds weird.

There are several reasons why I made this decision :

1. It is known as an 'old lady name'... e.g Gertrude (not my name but an example) and it doesn't translate that well in the modern age.
2. I barely feel unique with it.

In some sort of coincidence, my birthday is on the same date as the death day of my grandma and I was named after her (explains the old lady name). For context, my father was abandoned as a child and my 'foster' grandma adopted him as a single mother- he has always held her in high regard, and everyone in my family highly respected her. While this is a sweet backstory, this led to some people actually thinking I'm her reincarnated and compare me to her almost every single day. I could be making a snack and its 'OMG! Gertrude used to love strawberries' or 'Gertrude hated that too!'.

Whats even weirder is that a lot of people randomly think I have maternal qualities too. The amount of times I had to hold my baby cousins simply because im named after my grandma is crazy- they would also say things like 'wow she takes after Gertrude, look at her holding the baby!'. My father is probably the worst at this and encourages comments like that. My mom thinks its sweet and recognizes that this is how they cope with her loss.

Unfortunately, this has led to me not feeling unique, I barely feel like my own person because of it. I know my family would go crazy if I changed it but it weighs down on me every time my name is mentioned. People also typically mispronounce it since it's not that common.

I decided to socially change it (among friends and online) to test it out and I've really liked it. I chose a name that is pretty common in the country I live in.

Since my friends don't know about Gertrudes legacy, they are more accepting- however some believe that the new name I chose discounts my cultural heritage since the one I chose is based on the country I lived in for ease. I didn't think it was a big deal since I plan on living there for the rest of my life and is a huge part of me.

I remember I tried discussing this problem with my parents and my mom got mad that I 'was taking this away from my father' and that he loves the name (as well as his entire family). My mom told me to not tell my father if I do decide to change it since he might actually disown me if he found out. She believes that my reasoning isn't that great so I should learn to deal with it.

I feel conflicted and I'm not sure if my reasoning is enough- I am also wondering if I should choose a name that reflects my heritage (for context im biracial and my friends believe the name is too 'white').",Not the A-hole,2024-09-01,"AITA for changing my name even though it has significance in my family?

I won't get into all of it, but just know that it's been a nightmare, including my house being hit by 20 bullets during a gunfight at a neighbor's Airbnb party earlier this year.

Fast forward to last night, the guests at the Airbnb next door were blocking our shared driveway. I went out and politely asked them to move their car. They responded rudely, saying, ""ain't got the keys. NO,"" and then drove off in another car.

I've tried reaching out to the Airbnb owner before, but she hasn't responded to me since May. Given her track record of ignoring my messages, I assumed she wouldn't do anything this time either. So, I shot her a quick text and called the non-emergency police line, explained the situation, and they said they would make the guests move it.

Well, it turns out they towed the car instead. Now, the Airbnb owner is furious, saying I didn't give her guests a chance to move it. Am I the asshole for calling the cops on them?

I really missed them, so I wanted to go. Knowing my boyfriend enjoys this kind of music, I thought it would be nice to bring him along.

I'm 16f, Sam is 17m, Serenity is 15f.

I have a younger brother (12) and sister (11). Sam and Serenity have two younger siblings (11 and 9).

My dad died and Nick's first wife died. When my mom and Nick got married 7 years ago, they tried to have each other adopt the kids from the first marriage. Sam, Serenity and I said no. We even went to court and separately talked to the judge about it. We said we did not want to be adopted. Mom also got denied a name change for me because of the lack of adoption. But my brother and sister and Nick's younger kids were adopted.

My mom and Nick tried to talk us around. They tried to win us over to their side of things. Nick tried to bond with me as a dad while mom tried to bond with Sam and Serenity as a mom. We rejected them in those roles. Nick is fine. He'll never be my dad. I will never accept him or give him the same love and respect I have for my dad still or that I had before he died. My dad wasn't perfect. It's not about my dad being some perfect person who can never have a flaw because he died. But he's my dad. I don't want another one.

Mom has told me how much it would mean to her if I gave him a chance to be more than just the guy she married. She said she'd like to know he would raise me if something were to happen to her. Sam and Serenity feel the same, or at least are similar to me, about my mom and their mom.

We're getting older now and nothing has changed. So my mom and Nick asked us to give family therapy a shot to see if we can't get everyone adopted before any of us turn 18 and leave the house. Sam and Serenity said no straight away. I didn't answer but told my mom no in private. I told her I'm not going to try and see Nick as my dad. I don't want to work on wanting him to adopt me. I don't want to hear that it doesn't replace my dad or is for security and think of inheritance or safety. I told her I will not go.

My mom is pissed that I'm not willing to try. Nick asked me why I can't just attend some sessions and see if we can't end up on the same page. I told him I don't want to be on his page and he only wants me on his, not to see my side.

My mom is pissed that I'm not willing to try. Nick asked me why I can't just attend some sessions and see if we can't end up on the same page. I told him I don't want to be on his page and he only wants me on his, not to see my side.

68,1f6gbc6,WIBTA if I brought up my desire to be a pallbearer at my Grandfather's funeral?,"My grandfather died recently and rather unexpectedly. He was eighty-seven but was also relatively healthy, having led an active lifestyle up until recently.

I loved my grandfather very much. He was my only living male grandparent, and I would say the grandparent I was closest to and the one I liked the best. I am also his only (biological) grandchild.

As a bit of context, my grandfather had five children, including four sons and one daughter (my mother). Further, right before I was born my grandfather remarried to a lovely woman who had three sons of her own. This means, that alongside my four (full) uncles, I have three step-uncles and five step-counsins. Normally, I care for and respect all of these people grealty, especially the woman who my grandfather married, who has referred to me as her ""sort-of"" grandson on several occasions. For the purposes of this post I will refer to her as my step-grandmother.

Because I am in the final year of Uni and live quite far away from the state where my grandfather lived, I haven't been very involved in the organisation and planning of his funeral. I had generally expressed to my mother that I would like to be involved in the funeral, but honestly, given how recent (and unexpected) his death was we hadn't discussed what my involvement would be until today.

This afternoon, my mom told me that my role in the funeral would be to read a short message she had written (she thinks that she would be crying too hard to read it herself) and then add a few words of my own. I asked if there would be a funeral procession with pallbearers. My mother replied that there would. I asked who the pallbearers would be. My mother said that four of them would be my (full) uncles and two of them would be my **step**-uncles.

I was floored by the fact that two of my step-uncles were chosen as pallbearers instead of me. According to my mom, this decision was made by my step-grandmother, who has largely been organising the funeral with some input from my (full) uncles and my mother.

I want to be a pallbearer for my grandfather. He was my only male grandparent and I was his only grandchild. I want to carry him on his final journey out of this world. I want to support him as he so often supported me.

Because we had a blended family, I do understand that other people cared for him and had relationships to him. I also (somewhat) understand my step-grandmother's desire to have both parts of the family represented in the funeral procession. And perhaps in some small way I also feel a bit greedy already having a speaking role and wanting to be a pallbearer as well.

My mother has asked me not to press the issue, because my step-grandmother is having a hard time (which is obviously true) and because my grandfather would have liked the fact that I was speaking at his funeral (which I hope is true).

But despite that, I guess I am greedy because I still want to hold onto him one last time.

70,1f6fpm9,AITA Household Chores for stay at home parent ,"TLDR: my husband is supposed to take care of things at home while I work, but he doesn't. Yesterday he yelled at our daughter yesterday for not telling him she needed her laundry done (he's not washed in 2 weeks). AITA?

My husband is a stay-at-home dad to our 1 elementary aged child while I work full time and am taking a college class online. When she was born we agreed he could stay home until he was ready to return to work as long as he took care of the kid and household chores. At our last home he was very engaged in the community, but I honestly don't know how he spends his days since we moved and school started.

I'm sick of how poorly he keeps the house and have given up trying to communicate via the normal methods because it's always been met with resistance, and as much as I hate absolutes I do mean always. Dirty dishes clutter the sink, we can't eat at the table because it's clutter with stuff, and before yesterday's incident he hadn't done laundry in 2 weeks.

I've suggested a weekly routine or chore chart to divide responsibilities at home, and he rejects these ideas as if I'm calling him incapable of doing it. I recently tried a written honey-do list as a last ditch effort at communicating my household needs: 3 things daily for 3 days. That was 3 weeks ago and he's only done 6 of the items. I'm so tired of his excuses and his ""I'll do it tomorrow"" that I've given up.

So I hired a cleaning surface for dusting, sweeping, mopping, scrubbing the kitchen and bathrooms. I ordered a meal kit service because my body fat is alarmingly high from stress and him wanting to eat out 5 times a week or just heating pre-made convenience foods at home instead of actually cooking and treating vegetables as an afterthought.

Most recently he's not done laundry in about 2 weeks. In the past I asked if he wants help with laundry and he got upset that I ""dont trust"" him to get it done.

The past several days he's been bringing me one pair of clean undies each day as I ask before my shower because I don't have any clean ones--I won't ask him outright to do the laundry because past experience tells me he'll get offended and claim ""you don't trust me"" or ""you don't think I can do it.""

Yesterday he loudly blamed our daughter when she said she didn't have any clean shorts to wear, ""you should've told me you needed your clothes washed!""
We previously told her she just needed to put her dirty clothes in the hamper, which she had done. 

After she went to bed I asked my husband if something had changed and he said he told her she needed to speak up when she needs her laundry washed. He seemed offended that I would even ask.

Is there some way I can help him see that I've lost all respect for him because of his temper and how easily he gets offended because of his inaction?

71,1f6fdq2,AITA for questioning my family's alcoholic behavior when my mother was dying of alcoholism,"I come from a large family that has always had a pretty unhealthy culture of alcoholism. Since we were teenagers, we were encouraged by our parents to drink (but only when at home, when THEY were having a party). As adults, every time we got together it's was ALL alcohol all the time. My brother and mother subsequently developed severe alcoholism starting in the early 2000s. Fast forward to early 2023, and my brother has gone through rehab and is sober but extremely ill with liver disease. My mother had failed multiple rehab attempts and at 78 years old, was still drinking heavily. Unsurprisingly, my mother's kidneys stopped working in early 2023 from her drinking and was hospitalized.

Because I live out of town, I took time off from work to drive 7 hours to see her, only to stay in a hotel because one of my sisters had HER entire family (8 people) including a puppy and an infant staying at my parent's house. Fine. Next day hospital staff tells us there's nothing they can do for Mom but send her home with hospice - she only had a few days to live. We arranged for transportation and set her up in a hospital bed in my parent's home. She was already in really bad shape and not talking much. The hospice nurse came over, looked around at the 20-some people DRINKING at the house and plainly stated ""I know you all love her and want to be with her but what she needs is quiet right now. She knows she is dying and needs time to reflect before she passes"". My poor 80 year old father is hard of hearing, and was unable to hear what the hospice nurse was saying because of the DRINKING and LAUGHTER happening in the next room. I had to go ask them to be quiet and I got major attitude from one of my sisters: ""Mom would want to know that we're having fun and she would want us to be having a good time"" Yeah, right.

We all go on break and lunch together 90% of the time leaving the corridor empty for 30-50mins. We started noticing every now and then that someone was using the toilet while we were out. In itself not a problem but the smell and occasional mess (wasn't always fully flushed or blocked) was awful. There's no windows so no way to disapate the smell and air freshener was irritating. 

Over the last few months it's been happening more and more regularly it can be 3 times a week or twice in one day sometimes. We have no idea who is doing it and there's no pattern to it, also no one really wants to confront the culprit if we did see them so we were just living with it gross as it is.

2 weeks ago all but one of us went on break and a patient wandered into the corridor, was acting strangely and blocked the colleague in her office, she was pretty shaken up but thankfully we do have panic buttons in our offices. Afterward, I submitted a request for a lock on the corridor it's one of those key code ones and a bell. It's mildly annoying but we get very little traffic outside mail and a few Drs so it's not like we constantly have to let people in.

It got installed on Wednesday last week and Friday I got an email from one the medical secretaries (who works on a different floor) asking for the code to our corridor. I responded why would she need it? Immediately my phone rings. She explains she has bowel issues that she takes laxatives for and the toilet on our corridor is one of the only single cubical toilets in the hospital and it has the most privacy so she will be stuck without it. 

Where I might be the AH. I told her I was sorry but I didn't think we would be giving the code to any non necessary staff and hung up. The office is a bit mixed. Most are glad we won't have to deal with the stink she leaves behind but one girl thinks we are being needlessly cruel and it's not the reason we have the lock so we shouldn't gate keep a toilet and one is flip flopping. I do feel bad for her BUT she was making our work environment seriously unpleasant on a regular basis. 

So AITA?

TLDR I may be TAH for refusing to give the code for our corridor door to a member of staff from a different department meaning she can no longer use our toilet.

**Edit to add** it is hospital policy that areas where patient data are held are necessary staff access only. So I do not have access to any of the wards but I can access day surgery because it's relevant to my job. Her job in no way gives her any reason to be on our corridor so from a data security pov it doesn't matter that we are both employees.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-01,"AITA for blocking a colleague from using the toilet?

75,1f6d9s1,AITA for spending time with my (22F) friend instead of boyfriend (25M)?,"I have a much stricter schedule than my boyfriend; Most days I attend university - depends on lecture times but maybe around 9am or 12pm, join study cycles, go to the library and then when I get home I have daily tasks and hand-ins. I usually become free to do whatever I want around 7pm after dinner. Then I have around 3 hours before I have to go to bed around 10pm, and get up early the morning after.

My boyfriend doesn't attend university or work. He sits at home all day and plays video games. I support him in his search for a meaningful job that he enjoys, I think it's important, and due to depression he's been a bit ""behind"" at this. This does not matter to me. I love him and am confident he will find something eventually, I do feel he is lacking motivation but I can not fault him for that as - like I said - he has depression.

However, this is affecting the amount of time we spend together as he frequently stays up until around when I get up, that's when he goes to bed. Then he wakes up around 4pm and at that time we only have the hours I have free before bed. But recently I've been enjoying spending time with my friend, which usually falls into that same time-slot. I‚Äôve started inviting both my boyfriend and friend to hang out and we‚Äôv been regularly doing that.

Due to my introversion I want to continue only spending time one-on-one. I also don't want to become the person who brings their partner to every hang-out session. Most nights I welcome my boyfriend but some, I want to hang out with my friend alone. Today was one of those nights, where I said I did not want to hang-out in a group setting. He said OK. Then, when I was about to go to bed he requested to hang out which I denied. I apologized for being in a ""one-person mood"" today. He said ""So, that person couldn't have been me, just for a little while? :/"". Once again, he said I was prioritizing my friend over him.



This is the only point where both me and my friend are available, not due to choice but due to obligations, I feel it's only right that's when we hang out. If my boyfriend so wished to spend time with me, he would go to bed earlier and wake up earlier and him and I could hang out alone in the early hours of the day. Nothing is making him stay up at 8am by himself playing video games. He'll say multiple times that he wants to reset his sleep cycle, and he's trying to, yet I see him playing games until early morning every single day. He's saying that once again, I am not prioritizing him. 

There are many times where I have spent up longer than I should to play with him, to make up for his shitty sleep schedule, that has led me to be very drowsy in uni the next day. I feel it is unfair having to make adjustments in my cramped schedule. If he got up at a more ""normal"" time, around maybe 9am we could easily spend hours together. I don't understand why I have to compromise time with my friend, when he is not willing to compromise his fucked up sleep schedule! It feels unfair to me. AITA?

76,1f6cty2,AITA If I tell my friend they can't go to a concert with me. ,"Hi guy I'm out here looking for some outside veiws about a situation currently unfolding in my life. I (19m) bought vip tickets to go see a rapper I really like in a different state and the concert is on Friday. When I bought the tickets I had called my friend 19 who we'll call Ray for this post and asked if they wanted to go with me. Ray was super excited and immediately said yes. I told them if they wanted to go I would need them to pay me back for the tickets because they were expensive. Ray told me they would and so I bought the tickets back in May.

Fast forward to the end of August. The concert is now about a week away and I messaged them saying I had just realized they didn't have my Venmo and sent it to them as a kind reminder they still hadn't paid me back yet. Ray told me they get paid the next day and I told them cool and to add me whenever they could. Friday goes by so I messaged them Saturday morning at 9:30 asking if they added me on Venmo. They responded with a paragraph about how they were cleaning their friend's house and that they would add me later that night or tomorrow. I said okay. I messaged them again at 8pm giving them an ultimatum either they pay me by tomorrow night or I find someone else to go to the concert. They opened my message then ignored me because they were ""busy"" at a house party with their girlfriend so I had another friend (we'll call Bell) text them to see if they were just ignoring me or actually busy. Ray immediately replied to Bell. In that conversation Bell told Ray I was frustrated and that they needed to reply to me because they didn't want drama in the friend group. Ray blew them off and said ""I have been annoying all day about the money"" Bell told them that 200 dollars is a lot of money and they needed to talk to me. Finally they texted me back saying they would pay me tomorrow morning and that I was being hostile for no reason. This friend is notoriously bad at paying people back and anytime we hang out they use me as a free ride because they can't drive. They will ""forgot their wallet"" any time we go out or say they don't have the money so one of us have to pay for them and they never pay us back. I am just so tired of being treated like an Uber and being blown off and called annoying. I know they are just wait for me to cave but not this time. 210 dollars is a lot of money. I had been so excited to go with them but now I want to tell them not to even bother and that this friendship is over.

AITA? 
TLDR: friend won't pay me back for concert tickets even though they said they would and I'm considering ending the friendship. 

Edit:I should clarify the interaction with Bell. We had both been having problems with Ray and I had called them to vent and get help with the tone of my text messages. They decided on their own to text Ray to try and help. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-01,"AITA If I tell my friend they can't go to a concert with me.

Forgive me as I am on mobile. I am a 34f and i am married to my husband 38m. We have a wonderful relationship and are close. However, he keeps pushing me to get a drivers license.

For some background, when I was 18, I did have one. However, I was not a good driver. I had a few fender benders and after getting hit by a semi when it ran a red light, I decided that due to major anxiety about driving i cannot be a safe driver so I made the decision to not renew my license and drive. Also, having a car, registration, taxes, gas and repairs and maintenance was so expensive. So I decided when my license expired, I would not renew it and I have been happier. I take public transportation and use uber/lyft if needed. 

However, my husband feel that is more expensive. I showed him the math and even still he says everyone in the US wants to drive and therefore I should too. He said he is tired of driving me everywhere. I told him that he did not have to, and that I would be fine getting where I needed to go. He then said well, you never leave the house outside of work. Which is true but I prefer it. 

I thought me making this decision would be a smart thing, but he. His parents and even mine are telling me I have to learn how to drive again.

I recently have been having extreme tooth pain and decided to go to the dentist to get it looked at. The dentist told me I had an infection in my tooth due to a cavity I got when I was 17 and I would have to get it pulled. 

I told my boyfriend I set an appointment for Monday to get my tooth pulled and they‚Äôd likely put me on laughing gas and I would need someone to drive me home. My boyfriend said he was supposed to go on a hike with his mother and sister on Monday but told me he‚Äôd double check if it was still a plan because they haven‚Äôt talked about it in awhile. 

Two days pass and he tells me neither of them have answered his calls or texts about it and said he‚Äôd be able to drive me and take care of me at home. 

Today he told me his sister and mother replied and said the hike was still a thing and that he was no longer able to drive me to the dentist. I asked my best friend is she‚Äôd be willing to drive me to the dentist on Monday and she said she couldn‚Äôt cause she was visiting her family who lives 8 hours away. 

I told my boyfriend that he was the only one who would be able to drive me to the dentist except my father who lives an hour away from us and would be impracticable for him to drive an hour just to pick me up from the dentist. My boyfriend told me his family already doesn‚Äôt like me and thinks I‚Äôm stealing him from them and that him canceling to pick me up from the dentist will only make it worse. I was extremely upset at him and told him his family can go on a hike any other day but my tooth has been hurting so bad and it‚Äôs an emergency I just want some relief and I can‚Äôt reschedule because my antibiotics will run out before the next appointment. 

He threw a huge fit about how he could have done it himself if he were me and how I‚Äôm not independent enough to do things on my own and he didn‚Äôt think it would be a big deal. I told him I would call my dad and ask him if he could take me and he said no he was going to take me.

82,1f6b9aj,WIBTA if I  refused to pay the utilities?,"Hi all‚ÄîI‚Äôm a college student, and I recently took over the lease on a place on July 1st, though I am not moving into the place until mid-September. This is in a high cost of living area, so I had a subletter (Adrian) stay in the place for July and August. The previous tenant moved out on the last week of June. I believe Adrian began moving in on June 30th. There was another guy who also moved in on July 1st (Jack), and then there is a girl who has been living there for quite some time (Stacy). Stacy collects the rent and utilities each month.

When I took over the lease on July 1st, Stacy texted me asking if I was going to send her June utilities. I responded in saying that I believe the previous tenant should be responsible for that, since I was taking over for July 1 onwards, but that maybe I could help if it is needed (I wish I hadn‚Äôt said this‚Äîat the time I said it because I wanted to make a good first impression on Stacy since she was a new housemate, but I never really gave a clear yes‚Äîjust a maybe). I texted the previous tenant asking her if she could send June utilities to Stacy, she didn‚Äôt respond. I assumed it was possibly sent since I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about it from Stacy, and truthfully I didn‚Äôt care much because I felt it wasn‚Äôt my responsibility since I didn‚Äôt take over until July.

Apparently, what happened is when Adrian moved in, Stacy charged him for June utilities, and then for July, and then just now asked him for August. He was confused by this because he was only there for two months and didn‚Äôt realize she had charged him for June; he sent her the difference between June and August, which I thought was perfectly reasonable since he fully paid for the two months he was there for. He messaged me about this and also warned me that Stacy is a bit messy and difficult to deal with, but that Jack was great enough to make up for that, so it was still worth moving into the place this month.

Now Stacy is texting me asking me to send her June utilities since the previous tenant did not. It‚Äôs 73. She is complaining that Adrian deducted it ‚Äúwithout asking‚Äù and now she is at a loss. I truthfully think she‚Äôs being a bit unreasonable‚ÄîI took over the lease in July; neither Adrian nor I should have to pay for a month we weren‚Äôt there or on the lease for.

83,1f6b3fa,AITA for ignoring my dad's birthday and not getting him a gift?,"Ever since I (16m) was a little kid I got my dad a birthday gift with the help of my (surrogate) grandparents. My mom died when I was 2 so it was me and dad for a lot of years.

Dad and I used to be really close.

Then when I was 10 he met Jen and he met her kids who were 18 months and 3 years old at the time. Dad and Jen fell in love pretty fast and they moved in together a few months after they met. Jen was divorced and her kids dad wasn't around. So my dad decided he needed to step up and be a good dad to them. He told me things would change but I was still his son and he'd make time for me. But ever since he decided Jen's kids were going to be his, he let me down a lot. It started with us having plans and him having to cancel because one of the kids was sick. Then it was they had a play or a game he needed to be there for. Or it was they had decided to have one of the kids birthday parties early and dad needed to be there. But he wasn't doing the same for me. When I got sick he'd send me to my grandparents or expect me to stay with Jen while he did something with Jen's kids. If I had something on he'd apologize for missing it and would say he had plans with Jen's kids.

Oh, and the big thing that pisses me off is for the last 6 years (almost) he gives Jen's kids credit and thanks them too when I buy him a gift. Even when I tell him it's from only me. He talks about it being teamwork to get him that.

I tried talking to dad. He admitted he let me down. He told me he was afraid of Jen's kids feeling rejected if he were to cancel with them for me. That he didn't want them to feel like he loved me more when all three of us are equal. I told him he cares more about them and he asked how I could say that after 10 years of having all his attention. He asked me to think about the kids whose bio dad walked out on them and who could feel really unwanted if he were to let them down. I told him I didn't care about them or their feelings or whether they feel loved and wanted. I told him I don't feel loved and wanted. I feel resentful of the fact he gives them credit for my gifts, he cancels on me for them, but won't give the same back. He told me he can't change it but he can try to let me down less. I told him he was putting them ahead of me and I told him I was done. He can enjoy having two kids instead of three.

He didn't think I would actually follow through. This big talk happened back in April. Dad's birthday was yesterday and I didn't join in on any of the celebrations and I got him nothing. I didn't even say happy birthday. I knew they were going out for the day but I didn't go and I knew ahead of time. When they got home dad was upset because I was on the couch playing video games. He told me he'd missed me. Jen told me I had really hurt my dad and was behaving like a child instead of a 16 year old.

Finances aren't in the best shape right now, so I told her I didn't want to confirm anything until closer to the day (which is today).

Then next day my friend (let's call her C) told me my SIL invited her to the party, which I was happy about because C is my best friend. Another day after that, my SIL messaged me and said, ""I thought the party was gonna be family only??"" Which is strange considering she invited C. To which I reminded her that she did. She then proceeded to get upset about it and say she no longer is going to host it because I hadn't confirmed anything yet. Again, because I wasn't sure if I could afford it. I accepted her stance and said so be it, she can stay out of it. 

Now yesterday, she messages me again and immediately jumps right back into making plans, talking about the food she's gonna make, about how she's gonna pick up C and we're gonna have it at her house. So I asked her if we could rather have it at me and my fiance's house (we're neighbours so it's not out of the way for her) and if I could pick up C coz I had another friend I wanted to pick up.

Context - I (24f) hangout regularly with my best friend Matt (26 M) and my boyfriend Victor (30 M). We spend atleast an hour together everyday after we all get off from work just to chat/watch movies/ play video games. We all live close by soo we can do this everyday. Now we also meet a few other friends for drinks every weekend at a local bar. These friends include Sam (30 M) Nick (25 M) and Megan (25 F). 

Now the problems started a few weeks ago when I started a chapter of a well known NGO in our area. All of my friends joined it soo for last couple weekends we first do some activity regarding the NGO and then after we are done with that we go to our fav bar and have a couple beers before going home.

Last saturday Megan asked matt,victor and me if we would like to have drinks and a sleepover at her place on sunday since she has the place to herself. We werent sure why everyone else wasnt invited but we didnt press on that point too much thinking her house her wish.  But we informed her that we might not be able to make it since matt and victor had work early next morning and i have 3 pets at house who would need to be fed, watered at night and the next morning. After that everything seemed to go well on sunday at the NGO activity. Everyone was chatting and mingling with everyone and the event was a sucess soo to celebrate that we went for beers.

In the bar we were around 8-10 people having drinks (other members of our chapter joined us too) when megan started texting on matt,vic,I and her group chat demanding to know when we will leave from the bar for her place. We didnt realise we were getting these texts as our phones were in our pocket on silent and we were all having a blast at the table. After finishing her drink megan abruptly got up and announced that she will be leaving now. It wasnt late at all soo all of us tried to convince her to stay for another drink or just stay for a while and enjoy with us without drinking if she didnt want to drink more. She mumbled something under her breath and left. We were all confused but didnt think much of it at the time.

Now we have another activity planned for today (its sunday morning where i live) and i was texting all the members of the chapter to ask if they will be coming or not. When i checked my messages today to confirm a final headcount for tonight i noticed that megan had seen my messages but hadnt replied. I checked with matt and victor to see if she had said anything to them about today but she has also left their messages on seen.

I assumed she would have known that her comment would upset me, which is why I reacted the way I did. She told me that I shouldn't have responded like that, especially since she's leaving to study abroad in a week, she said that I overreacted a lot and I didn‚Äôt have the right to do so. 

I quickly realized that I was in the wrong, so I immediately apologized for my behavior. I acknowledged that I overreacted and thanked her for explaining her perspective. She told me that it was just a misunderstanding and that everything was okay. However, her actions since then suggest otherwise. She's been treating me poorly‚Äîignoring me, being cold, and generally distancing herself whenever I try to check in on her.

This situation has left me feeling really frustrated. There was a time in our friendship when she hurt me deeply, making me feel left out of our group. Suggesting to go do some activities  together and doing it secretly with the group without informing me, cutting me while I speak, getting jealous and treating me like shit if I got some complements of my appearance. When she finally apologized and btw she did not apologize for everything I listed, I accepted it and respected her effort to fix things, even though the hurt lingered. I moved on because I valued our friendship.

But now, looking at how she's treating me over something that feels much less significant, I'm starting to wonder if I did too much to make amends. I can't help but feel that my efforts were more than what was necessary, especially given how she's reacting now. I feel lost and unsure if I even have the right to be upset about this. Should I be feeling this way? Am I overreacting, or is my frustration justified?",TL;DR,2024-09-01,"AITA for getting angry after apologizing to my friend?

So my sister Louise (36)  recently returned from a trip overseas. For context we have been hearing about this trip for the past 8 months as it was a present from her partner. Every time we saw her she would mention "" saving for her trip"" and other small things here and there. Myself ( 29 f) and my other sister ( 33) would understand the excitement but start to get annoyed after about the 3 month mark as it would become almost impossible to meet as a family or have a conversation with her without turn into being about her trip (This is a consistant as she very rarely asks us questions about our life). When we started talking about things in our life it would somehow be diverted to her talking about what she was planning to do overseas etc. We started to just not talk about ourselves as it would just become to frustrating for it to be cut off to then be turned around back to her. To keep the peace we just didn't say anything but would make jokes here and there such as "" oh are you going on a trip we didn't know!"". 

So the problem that myself and my sister are having is that while she was away in our family group chat she was sending us photos and daily information about what she was doing essentially everyday or 2 days. She recently came back and asked if we were doing something for our mothers birthday in a couple weeks, While we were talking about it Louise essentially suggested we all meet so we can talk about her trip AND celebrate my mother's birthday 

My sister and I were shocked that she would even suggest it, as a birthday is nothing about her and politely suggested doing something another time as it's our mother's birthday and it should be about her. But we are now at a crossroads as we don't want to spend our time listening to her talk about a trip we pretty much already know about it.

92,1f69d48,AITA for getting frustrated with my friend who keeps comparing her grief over her mom's death to mine over my dog's death?,"I‚Äôm 16, and I‚Äôve recently lost my dog, who was almost 14.5 years old. He lived a long, full life, but his passing was incredibly difficult for me, especially since I watched him suffer at the end. My dog meant so much to me, and I‚Äôm really struggling with the grief.

I have a friend whose mom passed away three years ago from an overdose. I know that‚Äôs a tragic situation, but she constantly brings it up, especially when I talk about grief or the loss of my dog. Every time I mention my feelings, she responds with, ""I know how you feel; my mom died,"" which always feels like she‚Äôs comparing the two losses. It‚Äôs become so frequent that I feel like I can‚Äôt even express my own grief without her making it about her mom.

What‚Äôs more frustrating is that she also compares her mom‚Äôs death to the deaths of her dogs, who died in preventable ways (one got run over, another was attacked, etc.). I understand that grief is different for everyone, but it feels like she‚Äôs overshadowing my grief and not giving me the space to mourn my dog.

This isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened. Anytime I mention someone who died or even something my mom did, she brings up her mom‚Äôs death. It‚Äôs been three years of this, and I‚Äôve tried to be patient and understanding, but it‚Äôs becoming overwhelming.

Recently, while I was on a call with her, I was on the verge of tears talking about my dog‚Äôs death, and she compared it to her mom‚Äôs death again. I know she didn‚Äôt mean any harm, but in that moment, it made me so angry. I felt like she was making my grief about her, and it would‚Äôve been better if she‚Äôd said nothing at all.

I‚Äôve started to get frustrated with my friend and feel indifferent when she brings up her mom‚Äôs death. I know it sounds cold, and maybe I should be more supportive since losing a parent is devastating, but I‚Äôm struggling to care because of how often she brings it up, especially when I‚Äôm grieving my dog.

My friend hasn‚Äôt acknowledged that her constant comparisons make it hard for me to express my own grief. I find it difficult to talk to her about emotional stuff, so I‚Äôve never brought it up, partly because I worry it would be insensitive to her feelings. This behavior happens often, not just when we talk about grief, but in almost any conversation related to moms or death, where she tends to make it about herself. While she does support me in other areas of my life, she also sometimes leaves our calls when she gets bored, which makes me feel like I‚Äôm just there to fill her boredom. I think she‚Äôs trying to relate to me, but because she brings it up so frequently without asking for direct support, it just ends up frustrating me.

I understand grief isn‚Äôt comparable, and I feel like there‚Äôs no right or wrong way to feel as long as you feel something. But am I the asshole for getting frustrated and not showing much empathy toward her, even though I know she‚Äôs still grieving?

Sam is home from college for Labor Day weekend and I asked him about his collection. He said he hasn't care about it since he was in elementary school. I said well that's good because Alex is now into Pok√©mon and would like your old collection.

He said he didn't want to give it away either. I said well his birthday is coming up and that would be the best gift ever. It would be a nice gift because you don't spend any time with him and it would show that you love him.

I graduated in 2019 and moved out, COVID hit so I got a good deal for an apartment and as we all know we were in lockdown. I landed a great job which still provides me with a good life. I took a mortgage for a house 2 years ago and I invited my mum to live with me as she has no place to go. She rented an apartment back then. In 2022, my dad passed away and I inherited about 49 acres of Land from him. My mum divorced him when I was 7 years old. I'm his only child. A few months later my auntie sued me for what I inherited from my dad. I won the court case at the end. 

The issue here is my mum, who I invited to live with me took the opportunity to keep my paper when I travelled back from court. She used my land paper, forged my signature made up a story and scammed people. She used my land as collateral for her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù and took a loan of 5 million and gave it all to this person who she called ‚Äúfriend‚Äù The land is worth 12 million. I didn't know any of this. She told me she lost the paper as she is an old woman and becoming very forgetful. I went to the land department and went through the process of getting the new paper issue. 6 months later after I went through all that, the land department called me and said someone presented the actual paper so they could t issue a new one. 

I went over to the land department and saw all these loan papers and a document that I noticed immediately that was my mum's handwriting. I was called by the department and they told me that the signature on the authority letter was different, the documents presented by ‚Äúwhoever‚Äù were fake, and there was no harm done as all these were made without the land department certifying this. But they can t issue my paper as it's not lost but someone else is in the procession of it. I confronted her and she made no apology. She said if I want it back then go and sue whoever has my land paper. I was left with no choice but to report to the police. By this action, I am putting her on the road to jail. During the police investigation process, I found out that it was my mum who told ‚Äúwhoever‚Äù to go to the land department and present that the paper wasn't lost but she took a loan from it. Because if they issue my land paper, the old one will be automatically void. 

Until this day after I reported it to the police, it has been two months and she is been informing her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about my move and trying to get away with it. Until this very moment, she is still not on my side. She is forcing my hand to put her in prison. I just want my paperback. The police are in the process of getting it back. I have consulted with a lawyer, I will win this case eventually but this will take years. 

I found out today that I overheard her talking to her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about my moves, meeting the police, and submitting more documents blah blah. I can't even leave my ID Card, passport and any other documents in my own house. I have a strong urge to ask her to leave. But she got nowhere to go. She is 64 years old.

I went over to the land department and saw all these loan papers and a document that I noticed immediately that was my mum's handwriting. I was called by the department and they told me that the signature on the authority letter was different, the documents presented by ‚Äúwhoever‚Äù were fake, and there was no harm done as all these were made without the land department certifying this. But they can t issue my paper as it's not lost but someone else is in the procession of it. I confronted her and she made no apology. She said if I want it back then go and sue whoever has my land paper. I was left with no choice but to report to the police. By this action, I am putting her on the road to jail. During the police investigation process, I found out that it was my mum who told ‚Äúwhoever‚Äù to go to the land department and present that the paper wasn't lost but she took a loan from it. Because if they issue my land paper, the old one will be automatically void. 

Until this day after I reported it to the police, it has been two months and she is been informing her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about my move and trying to get away with it. Until this very moment, she is still not on my side. She is forcing my hand to put her in prison. I just want my paperback. The police are in the process of getting it back. I have consulted with a lawyer, I will win this case eventually but this will take years. 

I found out today that I overheard her talking to her ‚Äúfriend‚Äù about my moves, meeting the police, and submitting more documents blah blah. I can't even leave my ID Card, passport and any other documents in my own house. I have a strong urge to ask her to leave. But she got nowhere to go. She is 64 years old.

101,1f67pkc,WIBTA for not inviting people to my wedding?,"More than 2 years ago, I found out my ex-wife was cheating, so we separated and divorced a year later. We were part of a group of 13 friends - I kept all the friends. I was really close to a couple ('Ben' and 'Zal') because we did a lot of double dates. After the separation, things happened (won't go into details) that made me distance myself from them.

After the separation, I got closed to another couple ('Karol' and 'Manny') from the same group. However, almost a year later, I moved cities (4 hours away by flight), but even after leaving, I continued chatting with them... Actually, they were the only ones I chatted with privately.

After 1.5 years of no dating (waiting for the divorce to finalize), I started dating 'Alma'. She is the most amazing person I've ever met, and I‚Äôm certain she‚Äôs the love of my life.

While dating 'A', the group invited me on a trip (apparently because 'Karol' and 'Manny' suggested it). Although I went, I didn't feel a real connection; they felt like a part of my past. Another couple from the group got married during this trip and invited me, which was fun, but my favorite part of the trip was spending time with 'Karol' and 'Manny'.

Dating 'Alma' has been incredible, and after 11 months, I decided to propose; we‚Äôre getting married next year! While creating the guest list, I thought about inviting the whole group. I had good times with them, and even though we didn‚Äôt quite click on the last trip, I felt they still saw me as a friend. Each guest is expensive, but I think it‚Äôs worth it.

A week ago I spoke with 'Ben' to catch up but the convo felt forced and it felt as in he didnt want to really talk. 4 days later, I learned that 'Ben' and 'Zal' are expecting a baby, but they never told me directly; they informed everyone else in the group. I found out when they mentioned a gender reveal group call.

I told 'Karol' and 'Manny' about the wedding dates, and they were excited. But when I said I was inviting everyone from the group, they asked, ‚ÄúEveryone???‚Äù I asked why, and they replied, ‚ÄúYou know who your true friends are. You should be with people who love you and would be happy for you‚Ä¶ I won‚Äôt say any names. Do your own analysis, invite whoever you want, and we‚Äôll be there for you.‚Äù

Now, I feel conflicted about excluding people...

I‚Äôd feel bad not inviting the couple who invited me to their wedding. I‚Äôd feel bad not inviting 'Ben' and 'Zal'; I see it as an olive branch. The rest of the group is fine, but I barely speak to them.

This day is hard for me as I lost my dad a year ago ,"Today is my FIL‚Äôs birthday, it‚Äôs also Father‚Äôs day here. My partner really wants me to attend his dad‚Äôs bday lunch (which extends to dinner) and spend time with his family.

I can‚Äôt bring myself to go and socialise  it as it‚Äôs only been 13 months since my dad passed. Today is heavy for me. No personal issue with my FIL who is also celebrating his birthday, but it still hurts my dad isnt here anymore.

My partner understands why I cant go. My partner and myself also live with my sister and her young daughter. Sis also lost her partner (father of the baby) 2 years ago which makes this day really hard on us.  

I really dont want to hurt or disappoint my FIL but this is so difficult for me.  Anything dad-related stil hurts and tbh, the jealousy I feel that my partner still has his dad eats me up inside.


My partner‚Äôs family is very close and always wants us around to just eat together and spend time.. but lately with all the sadness and heaviness in my situation, I find it very hard. 

Please note my partner‚Äôs family is helping us buy a house right now which Im grateful for so I feel like a prick for not attending his bday celebration.

107,1f66eqz,AITA for leaving my (29f) girlfriends (30f) house after her kid made me mad?,"Today my girlfriend asked me to bring her by a soda and I ended up staying the whole day. She has a 5 year old and she was being wild all day which is totally normal for her. She's usually in my face constantly and doing things that tend to get on everyone's nerves but as far as I'm aware that's typical 5 year old stuff (idk a whole lot about kids)

Me and my gf have been dating for about 5 months and me having no prior experience with kids I have a hard time disciplining her when she does anything bad but even when I do she doesn't listen to anything I say. I'm usually good at pushing her off me or telling her no when I need to but my gf usually has to back me up for her to actually stop. This tends to be a big issue when my gf leaves the room because she ends up acting alot worse when her mom isn't around.

I can handle most things but I am extremely grossed out by spit and unfortunately my gfs daughter knows this. So tonight we were all making stuff out of duct tape and I was working on a mask. My gf walks off for about 15 minutes or so and her kid starts getting really hyper and climbs all over me, im asking her to settle down but that only makes her laugh and act worse. She then spits all over her hand, looks me dead in my eyes and smears it all over my barely constructed duct tape mask which is on my face... I get more stern and tell her to stop/back off as I rip the mask off my face and throw it on the bed. Ultimately this is what has me extremely heated but I just sit there and try to calm down. She then proceeds to throw my mask on the ground stomping on it and grabs some scissors and starts cutting it up. 

At this point I don't say anything and I'm over it I just want to go home. I'm very overwhelmed with how I feel and when my girlfriend comes back I tell her I need to go home and I leave. Once home I text her and tell her that I was sorry for leaving suddenly like that, told her what her daughter did and just explained I was overwhelmed. She doesn't reply and I ask if shes mad. She tells me it doesn't matter and for me to enjoy the rest of my night. 

I'm unsure how I should have handled it. I mean sure maybe I should have stayed but this isn't the first time her daughter has spit on me knowing I can't stand it and I'm still really new with kids so it was just alot and all I knew is I wanted to exit the situation so I could think clearly.

110,1f65hgi,WIBTA for not allowing my sister to own a cat?,"Throwaway because I don't want this on my main account. For context, I am a teenaged middle child of three daughters. We own three pets: two dogs and one rabbit. Both my father and I are allergic to cats, but aren't deathly allergic.

This past year since October 2023 has been the worst our family has ever been through, and it has affected everyone in many ways.  My younger sister (who we will call Cheyenne) has always been the more rebellious kid, and due to some of her choices, does not have a stable view of herself and eases the pressure through anger directed toward herself and everyone else. My parents don't really know how to handle her behavior sometimes and are trying to help her. Recently, she brought up wanting a cat for years, ranting about how bad she wants one since a recent trip outside the country. My mother is on board, my older sister goes with the most popular vote, and my father only needs to be convinced. Last week, Cheyenne asked to stop by the pet store, and we played with the cats for a little while. Apparently my mother was so touched, she already started talking to my father about adopting a kitten. I have not been asked about my opinion. They know I am allergic.

If I pet a cat and rub my eyes without washing my hands, I get red elevated spots on my eyelids, sneeze a million times and get nosebleeds from the sneezing. I already sneeze too much due to how old the house is, and I really don't want to make it even worse. This house is the only place I have, and I cannot evade the consequences of having the allergy and a cat. However, if my father is successfully convinced, it'll be 4 against 1. I don't know what to do.

I have been struggling mentally since mid July, and I honestly am not sure why. I feel like my unstable mental health may just be clouding my judgement, and I need second opinions. But I want Cheyenne to be happy again, I just don't know if I can sacrifice this one. I will be answering as many comments as possible.

112,1f65co1,AITA for telling my mom to stop drinking?,"I (21m) told my mother (42f) that she needs to get sober. She keeps saying im ""bossing her around"" and that she is ""a grown woman who can have a drink when she wants too"". She (along with most of my family) has a horrible history with alcohol. There was a time in my life where i almost disowned her as my mother because of how bad it got. Most of my teenage years i felt a responsibility for her safety, and have carried her up the porch stairs drunk multiple times. 

The past two years she was been recovering from a DUI car accident. Nobody got hurt and she did her time in jail, and there was a good few months after getting out where she stayed sober. She was on probation at first, where she had to do weekly check ins to confirm she wasn't drinking. Lately though, her restrictions have been mostly lifted, besides a few online classes. In my opinion, without an authority telling her what to do she doesn't care. With probation she was following rules out of fear of going back to jail, but it's like the second that stopped a flip switched in her brain that told her she's free again. It started with drinks at restaurants, then shots, then buying bottles, then getting wasted. 

I have never been addicted to anything, I've never smoked a single cigarette or had a single drink in my life, so here's where i think i might be an asshole. In a recent conversation with my mom, I told her she needs to quit drinking. I told her how it made me feel, and how i can see it negatively affecting her already. I told her nobody likes her when she's drinking, and it makes everyone worried for her, and i told her i still feel responsible for her actions even if she is my mom. I told her she can't be the kind of person to have 'one drink' and it always ends up the same shitty way every time. 

I asked her what sign from the universe she needs to finally stop, besides her kids and the government telling her to, and she told me to stop making her decisions. She told me i dont understand, and that's she's a grown woman that can do whatever she wants. She told me the person she is when she's drinking is the same person she is when she's not, and saying one is worse  than the other is an insult to her. I feel like im completely right, she is the worst version of herself when drinking and i have years of childhood memories to prove it. But, I also do think she's right that i dont understand. I know it's not easy to just stop, it's an addiction not a hobby, but she won't even admit she has it!

In a recent conversation with my mom, I told her she needs to quit drinking. I told her how it made me feel, and how i can see it negatively affecting her already. I told her nobody likes her when she's drinking, and it makes everyone worried for her, and i told her i still feel responsible for her actions even if she is my mom. I told her she can't be the kind of person to have 'one drink' and it always ends up the same shitty way every time. 

I asked her what sign from the universe she needs to finally stop, besides her kids and the government telling her to, and she told me to stop making her decisions. She told me i dont understand, and that's she's a grown woman that can do whatever she wants. She told me the person she is when she's drinking is the same person she is when she's not, and saying one is worse  than the other is an insult to her. I feel like im completely right, she is the worst version of herself when drinking and i have years of childhood memories to prove it. But, I also do think she's right that i dont understand. I know it's not easy to just stop, it's an addiction not a hobby, but she won't even admit she has it! 

My brother thinks I'm not the asshole, but i was too harsh. I haven't really talked to anyone else about it, so AITA? ",0.0,0.035342808812856674,0,1
113,1f64tf1,AITA for crossing state lines and not telling my mom?,"Some context before the story:

I (F20), live at home with my mom (F48), my little sister (Jane, F15). I own my car outright, and the car isn't in perfect condition, but that's fine.

I have two close friends in this story, Josh (M21) and Ash (NonBinary20). Ash and I have been long distance friends for 6 years. Recently, Ash has moved a LOT closer, just one state over from mine. My mom does not like Ash. At all.

Now, onto the situation at hand:

After being shunned by a long time group of friends, I was absolutely distraught, and so I called Ash in tears, and they tried to convince me to drive 4 hours, sleep over, and go back in the morning.

I refused, citing lots of excuses, trying to be the rational one. But then they got Josh involved, and he suggested we drive out the NEXT weekend and go to the beach near where Ash lives. That way we all got to be together and maybe that would help me feel better. Now that sounded much better. So it was decided.

Within that week, my car got a LOT of work done (which I will not specify). The mechanic suggested to not do anything crazy, because the car still wasn't in incredible condition. I was genuinely hooked on doing this beach trip. We'd all cleared our work schedules. This was happening.

When my mom heard about my car, she immediately decided that I was NOT to drive the car anywhere but work and home because it was too dangerous. And I hadn't even *told* her about the beach day up the coast.

Here's where I might be the asshole. The more and more she talked about how I couldn't take the car on long trips and etc, the more I spiraled. I had a really intense panic attack, and so when I finally went to talk to her, I told her that Josh and I were meeting Ash at a beach about an hour and a half away. She told me that she thought I was being stupid and there was no reason for the trip, but she wasn't going to stop me.

My plan: stop for gas near the beach I claimed we were going to and call my mom, letting her know that Josh and I had arrived, and then carry on to our final place. But she saw a text to Jane saying ""hey change of plans, we're going to (final meeting point) instead, please don't say anything"". Jane and I share locations, so I didn't want her to see, get confused, and ask my mom if we'd changed plans. I had EVERY INTENTION of telling my mother where I'd been as soon as I got home. Instead, I get a call from her calling me a ""fucking liar"", don't bother coming home tonight, etc.. Which is very much not like her and she hung up on me.

My mom and I went for a walk the next night, where she continued to call me a liar and talking about how Ash is some kind of witch seducing me into making bad choices (when really I just needed out because I was drowning and no one was listening to me). 

I know at LEAST I'm kind of a sucky daughter, but AITA?

116,1f64hle,AITA for ditching my friend?,"So last month, a friend and I agreed to watch a play in the west end with a ticket costing 35 pounds for the each of us. I asked her to pay me back but she said that she couldn‚Äôt due to financial issues but she would be happy to cover the meal we would have prior to the show. This would work quite well as it would also had been my bday weekend, so it‚Äôs like a cute little plan.

The day arrives and we decide to go to a gallery. There was a paid exhibition that I paid for too and we had a good time. I remember asking her if she was going to be ok with covering the bill as I know she is incredibly unreliable. She assured everything was good. 

Well, lo and behold when it came to cover the bill of the lunch, she made me split it 50:50.

She clearly had no intention as we agreed and basically had told the waiter to split in half. I paid obviously. For the avoidance of doubt, we ordered the same stuff basically and the literal difference between the price ticket and the food was like 3 pounds. At that point, we left for the theatre and I asked if she wanted the tickets as I was going home as I was feeling quite drained (from her behaviour). The first reasoning I got was that she simply couldn‚Äôt afford it but then she changed it (in less than 10 seconds) saying she was trying to save money.

I spent weeks in May and June searching for a place, checking Zillow, FB, Craigslist, etc. I found a condo unit from Beth (38F) that fit my needs and budget. After verifying the unit via FaceTime and through a friend, I signed the lease. I paid a $35 credit check fee, $600 move-in fee, and the first month‚Äôs rent. Beth sent a guideline sheet stating, ‚Äúif anybody asks about your occupancy, direct any questions to the owner,‚Äù which should have been a red flag.

Ten days before moving in, I asked Beth if the unit was being professionally cleaned. She assured me it was and that all repairs were made. However, when I arrived, the apartment was in poor condition: year-old meat in the freezer, pet hair on old furniture (which aggravated my allergies), yellow stains on the mattress, and dead bugs in corners. Beth was understanding and sent a cleaning team a week later, but my brother and I had to move out and dispose of the old furniture, clean the apartment, and deal with the mess. This was a lot of work for the $600 move-in fee.

Despite the inconvenience, I moved past it. Mistakes happen, right? Then, 20 days into the year-long lease, Beth informed me that her HOA was threatening legal action because she was violating association rules by renting out the condo to non-family members.

Chase was at his mom's house last week and he texted me to call him. That was unusual so I immediately called. He said he was in the bathroom taking his bath and he has a bump ""down there."" He thought it was a spider bite. 

He wasn't in any pain or discomfort but wanted to know what was going on. I asked if his brothers were home and he said no. I asked who was home and he said his sitter ""Vince"" and stepdad ""Grady."" But Vince was leaving. 

I called Vincent up and asked if he was still there and he said he was literally at the front door. I said Chase was in his bathroom and he's freaking out over something personal. Could you please go talk to him.

15 minutes later Vincent called me back and said Chase has a pimple down there. Nothing to worry about. I got pimples down there when I was younger. 

Later, my ex called me up and said something weird happened with Chase in the bathroom and Vince went up there. I asked how did she know and she said Grady told her. He was concerned. 

I said our kid got freaked out over a pimple and called me. I asked Vince to check and he confirmed. It's fine. She asked me why I didn't ask Grady. I was a bit confused by that question.

Why would I ask him?

She said because he's his stepdad. She gets not asking her but not Grady. I said because it didn't feel right to me. Vincent is like family. She took offense to that. I explained that Grady has only been in the picture for a few years. Vincent has  even around for almost 5.

We ended the call and then she called me back saying that Grady was upset that I didn't ""trust"" him. She then said that she told Chase that Grady is always there to help or answer personal problems like the pimple one.

I picked up Chase today and said Grady loves him and wants to help him with anything but in a case that this, just go to me, Vincent or one of your brothers. If it's life or death, then go to anyone.

Chase already picked the tension between everyone and I explained that this was one of those things that the adults needed to discuss. I don't think something like this will ever happen so let my ex and Grady think what they want to think. ",Asshole,2024-09-01,"AITA for telling my son that there are only three people he can go to if he has a personal problem? My youngest son Chase is 9 and has a pretty open relationship with everyone (me, his mom, stepmom, stepdad and his older brothers). 

Chase was at his mom's house last week and he texted me to call him. That was unusual so I immediately called. He said he was in the bathroom taking his bath and he has a bump ""down there."" He thought it was a spider bite. 

He wasn't in any pain or discomfort but wanted to know what was going on. I asked if his brothers were home and he said no. I asked who was home and he said his sitter ""Vince"" and stepdad ""Grady."" But Vince was leaving. 

I called Vincent up and asked if he was still there and he said he was literally at the front door. I said Chase was in his bathroom and he's freaking out over something personal. Could you please go talk to him.

15 minutes later Vincent called me back and said Chase has a pimple down there. Nothing to worry about. I got pimples down there when I was younger. 

Later, my ex called me up and said something weird happened with Chase in the bathroom and Vince went up there. I asked how did she know and she said Grady told her. He was concerned. 

I said our kid got freaked out over a pimple and called me. I asked Vince to check and he confirmed. It's fine. She asked me why I didn't ask Grady. I was a bit confused by that question.

Why would I ask him?

She said because he's his stepdad. She gets not asking her but not Grady. I said because it didn't feel right to me. Vincent is like family. She took offense to that. I explained that Grady has only been in the picture for a few years. Vincent has  even around for almost 5.

We ended the call and then she called me back saying that Grady was upset that I didn't ""trust"" him. She then said that she told Chase that Grady is always there to help or answer personal problems like the pimple one.

I (24F) work closely with 5 coworkers. Three of them are between the age of 20 to 24, one is 37 yrs old and the last one is over the age of 50. I invited the three of the younger ones to Applebees with me for my birthday. Now for little bit for information on why I didn‚Äôt invite the 37 year old (let‚Äôs call her Hannah).

Hannah is the exact opposite of me and has nothing in common. She is very religious;I am not. She doesn‚Äôt like to cuss or to hear anyone cuss around her;I cuss let a sailor. She doesn‚Äôt smoke devil lettuce; I smoke a lot.

After thinking about inviting her I decided against it because I felt like she was going to be very uncomfortable. So I didn‚Äôt. Fast forward to the dinner, my other coworkers and I had a great time. We smoked and had crazy but funny conversations. But the next day at work Hannah found out that we went to Applebees. Now she keep trying to guilt trip us about it. I explained to her why I didn‚Äôt invite her but she just started crying and continued to guilt trip us

Side note: it was a secret that we went, we was just trying not to rub it in her face

122,1f637tu,AITA for correcting my boyfriend about football (soccer),"My (F20) boyfriend (M20) was going out to eat with his friends, and invited me to come with him since they were bringing their girlfriends too.

They were chatting and my boyfriend brought up the topic of Manchester United since the Premier League restarted. He said that United is doing poorly just like last season after the loss to Brighton, its the same story. He then talked about how Son (Heung Min Son) should leave United, that he's wasted his entire career there he's trophyless and he'll retire soon. This is where I spoke up and told him that Son has never played for United, he plays for Tottenham. And I told him that if he were playing for United he would have a trophy right now since they won the FA Cup final. He told me that I was wrong so I showed him on my phone, and he changed the topic with his friends.

After this was over, when my boyfriend was dropping me off, he complained to me that I didn't need to correct him in front of his friends. When he told me that I was wrong I should have just left it alone and that me taking out my phone to prove him wrong was childish. I said that I wasn't trying to correct him in a bad way I just wanted to show him. He told me that it's a guy thing, and that I shouldn't do that, he's upset that I acted like that. I didn't know what to say so I was just silent until he dropped me off. He didn't say bye to me when I left.  
  
For some context, my boyfriend has played football since elementary and now plays for our college club. He's a student athlete. I haven't played for a team since middle school, but my main hobby is football, it's just my interest and I've played FIFA a lot since I was a kid. This is what we talk about mainly so I don't know why he was so offended by me correcting him.

Last night he told me he had a very important work meeting and wasn't going to be able to pick his daughter up from her playdate at her friends house today. I volunteered to pick her up and take her back to my place ( that she has been to many times ) and watch her until he got back because I work at home and it wouldn't be a problem. 

He was okay with this and dropped off her booster seat with me earlier today. 

I had to take care of some work before It was time to pick her up and it ended up taking longer then I had expected. I looked at the clock and saw that it was past the time to pick her up from her friends house, and I knew installing the booster seat would take up even more time, so I just went and picked her up without it. 


When I picked up his daughter she asked why her booster seat wasn't there and I told her she was going to ride without it today and she'd be fine. She was very quiet the entire drive which seemed odd to me because she is usually a very talkative kid. 

When my boyfriend got back his daughter went and hugged him and told him that I didn't have her booster seat for her. He confronted me about this and I told him I lost tack of time and so I just picked her up without it.

 He was furious with me! He said it was so irresponsible of me to not have her booster seat for her and that I put her in danger. 

I tried to calm him down and said how sorry I was but he didn't want to hear it. He took his daughter home and hasn't responded to my calls or texts since. 

I also received a call from his ex wife where she expressed how upset she was at me for putting her daughter in danger.
