0,1f7bn25,AITA for deadnaming my friend?,"I (F38) have been friends with Jane (F38, AMAB) since we were 5. We never had secrets from each other, loved hanging out together, and have a lot of memories we share. I remember when we innocently played dress up with two big suitcases of clothes my granny used to wear and let us play with, before any real questions even started. In our late teens I was the first one Jane confessed to when she thought she might be gay and the first one she confessed to not really feeling like a man when we were in our twenties. Both times she asked for my secrecy until she was ready to come out. I was her sounding board when she was trying out new names before settling on Jane – she is a fan of L. M. Montgomery and the bit from Jane of the Lantern Hill where Jane is finally called by the name she likes really resonated with her. She asked me to call her Jane in private, I have been doing that for years now. 

Last year, Jane finally decided to come out to her family and take steps towards transitioning. I was happy for her but I didn’t account for how difficult it would be when it came to memories from before. Until then, when I called her Jane we were in the present. Now that she wanted to stop using the old name, I was still thinking of her past self as he/him. This was my friend who was the first person I thought of when someone told me girls and boys could never be friends. The friend for whom I couldn’t get a matching t-shirt because the ones I liked were only in women’s sizes. There were entire memories with Jane very much male-presenting called the other name. There were books and cards I got from her inscribed with the old name that was still very familiar. 

Last week I was talking over the phone with a family member and mentioned that \[place\] was the place where \[a few friends and Jane’s old name\] went when we were in our twenties. Jane heard me and I could see she was hurt. I apologised and explained that I was still getting used to talking about her with others that way and that when I recall things from the past it’s often like \[Jane’s old name\] is a previous version of her, the caterpillar to her current butterfly and that I don’t see her as \[old name\] now. She was upset and told me I of all people had enough time to get used to her being Jane, that many of our friends that don’t know her half as long managed to get used to it and that I didn’t even update my phone contacts with her current name. That part is true but she knows that I NEVER update my contacts - it’s enough that I can identify the number (all my school friends have their maiden names there, half of the oldest contacts cut off because that’s what transferring numbers via SIM card was like, our old classmate is under the nickname ‘Cap’ he had when we were 15, I have ‘Alex the Gnome’ for a DnD friend from 2004) Jane said she needs to think about it and left.

1,1f713zu,AITA for asking if I can wear a suit to my brother’s wedding since I hate dresses?,"   So for context, I’m a 17 year old girl. I have an undercut and dyed hair all the time. I’m fruity and I hate dresses or skirts. 
   Today, after coming home from work, my family (my mom, my brother Ted, his fiancé Lila, and me) started talking about my brother and his fiancé’s wedding. They are getting married in May 2025. 
   I’m just listening to the whole conversation while eating my dinner after work. I then hear my mom ask the question “what kind of dresses are you thinking for the bridesmaids? Are they all gonna be identical or are you thinking just the same color and they can pick their styles?” 
   Don’t get me wrong, if they were to come out and say to my face, “I’d prefer it if you wore a dress” I totally would, but I’ve always hated them. They’re either fridge shaped grandma dresses or slutty stripper dresses. No dress has ever flattered my body and personality. During my sophomore year homecoming dance, I wore a button down with a corset and dress pants. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not fully masculine, but I prefer not to be super “girly girl” if that makes sense. It’s not who I am (no I’m not trans I just prefer to be more masculine presenting in my clothing). 
   I chimed in after Lila said that she wasn’t sure about the dressed yet and I asked if there was any way I could possibly not wear a dress (I’m one of the bridesmaids) and maybe instead wear a suit of sorts or a tux? Lilac looked over at my brother Ted and then both seemed fine with it. No obvious disgust or dislike for the idea. 
   I then see my mom in the background shaking her head and mouthing to “stop it”. Lila and Ted both said it shouldn’t be an issue and they actually have “dresses” that are pants instead of skirts but still flow enough to pass as a dress if I would prefer that since it’s not a skirt and I wouldn’t have to be uncomfortable all night. 
   I just explained how I felt. That I really hate the more girly look of dresses and have no interest in wearing any frilly fluffy thing if I have the choice. 
   My mom just kept motioning to shut up like I was doing something wrong. Lila said that she would definitely see about it, but didn’t seem bothered at all. My brother just kind of lost interest in the conversation while playing with his fur baby so I’m sure they’ll talk more about it later, but I just feel like it’s now my fault for ruining their “perfect wedding plans” all because of my preference in the clothing I wear. It would be one thing I think if I wore dresses but just didn’t wanna wear what she picked, but I genuinely hate dresses with a passion. The only two I own are used as “laundry day clothes”.

2,1f6wd86,UPDATE: AITA For Not Offering To Care For My Unwell Ex-Husband?,"Throwaway Account

I forgot about the password to this account and my step-daughter showed me what to do and once I accessed this I saw that I got a few messages from people asking for an update so I thought I'd share.

First, a few people seemed to be confused so let me be clear, I am a woman who is married to another woman. My own parents passed away years ago so their opinion is irrelevant. My wife and I both have children from previous relationships but we didn't meet until after our children were adults so my wife and I are the only ones who have lived together. Now on to what almost everyone else cares about the most.

I went on cruise! It was great and my wife and I had a really great time. My children were predictably unhappy and I'm sure that my temporary blocking of them didn't make it better. Most of my children kept calling and telling me that I was a selfish and awful woman for choosing to go on the vacation instead of being there for the family, but (like many have you have stated) I reminded them that their father divorced me and therefore my obligations to him ended. If it were any of them that had a medical need I would cancel without question but I would not for their father.

I thought I could leave it at that but because they kept calling and texting the first three days of the trip and that's when I decided to block. Unfortunately, my ex's health took a turn for the worse and he had to go back to the hospital and his lack of proper care triggered an investigation. I didn't know any of this until I unblocked my kids the day I got back and some of them blamed me.

I've come to the conclusion that they're all just mad at the situation and I'm a convenient villain. I've accepted this because I can understand the fear and anger of facing the idea of losing a parent that you love. I just hope that one day we can all sit down with a family therapist and mediate the situation.

However, this did start to trigger my past tendencies of sacrificing my own happiness and well being for my children, but my wife, therapist, and even a small piece of my inner self had to remind me that my children are adults and that my ex isn't my responsibility. I tried to reach out and so far most of my children aren't talking to me and have made it very clear that I will not be able to see my grandchildren as a punishment.

It's sad, and I'm still wrestling with the guilt and doubt, but my wife and stepchildren are being very supportive, while my other family is a mix and most of my friends are neutral.",UPDATE,2024-09-02,"UPDATE: AITA For Not Offering To Care For My Unwell Ex-Husband? Throwaway Account

3,1f7lu4l,AITA for wearing my fiancées shirt in front of my dad?,"I wanna clarify I used the nsfw tag for vague mentioning no details will be shared. I also want to clarify my fiancée and I are both trans but in quotes of me talking to my father I will use the wrong pronouns, please don’t in your response. 
Last week I (19m) went to my fiancée  (22f) apartment and spent the day with her and she asked me to help her get the hair off her legs, and in the process I got it all over my shirt. So I took it off and borrowed one of hers to avoid a chemical burn.
The next day I was getting ready for work and I decided to wear her shirt and I walked out to help my dad (43M) with groceries and after we’d finished doing so he asked what was on my shirt and I responded “it’s *Deadname redacteds* shirt so I don’t really know,” and the following conversation ensued. 
Dad: why’re you wearing his shirt?
Me:I got stuff all over my shirt so I took one of his 
Dad:We’ll why’re you taking your shirt off over there?
Me: *Makes an uncomfortable face that he perceives as smug* I got stuff all over my shirt 
Dad: You must think I’m stupid
Me: Do you want me to say the quiet part out loud?
My dad then walked off and I was fuming so later when I went to work I texted him this; 
“ The conversation we had earlier really pissed me, especially because you got so mad at me even though you kept prying for more. As long as I’m not hurt or doing something illegal, what I do with my partner is my business and I would appreciate it if you would respect that. And I got Nair all over my shirt,”
 There was radio silence on the matter until today where I asked my mother her opinion which she agreed with my father and said that it feels like “slap in the face” and that I’m “flaunting” that I’m having sex with my fiancée. I have been with her for 8 months, engaged for 2 and have only mentioned sex 3 times. Once when I brought up having a miscarriage at the beginning of our relationship, once when I was having pain and didn’t know what to do and was scared so I texted my mom what to do, and then when my father asked me why I took my shirt off which was mentioned indirectly. 

We argued and I ended up asking my father, why he even asked why I took my shirt off, and he said he wanted to confirm his suspicion and then when I accused him of doing it so he had an excuse for yelling, which he is known for doing, he proceeded to yell at me and tell me to get out if I don’t like it. I live with my parents so I just went to my room to cry and didn’t know what to do.

6,1f7l677,WIBTA if I told my boyfriend that he's too sensitive?,"So my(20F) boyfriend(24M) is not very *emotionally strong.* And I know every person is different but it is on a whole new level with him. He lets even the smallest inconvenience completely derail his life. Here's an example:

When we were in uni together and he was a senior, there was a rumor going around just before the start of the year that the university was going to revoke the dormitory rights of the seniors, forcing them to live off-campus. Naturally every person would be very upset at this news, but he lost all of his shits. First he cried, then he tried to break up with me ( we were dating for 9 months at this point) after that he had a rage episode and finally refused to talk to me for **days.** And this was over a ***false*** rumor.

And it's not even just this. A few months ago there was a mix up in his kidney function results. We went to 3 medical professors and they all said he was completely fine but even after hearing that he would not calm down. He went from a guy obsessed with a healthy diet, a good social life and a love for working out to someone who eats junk food all day inside his room just playing video games, saying he was as good as dead.

It's obvious that he has some form of a mental illness but whenever I try to even hint at it he gets super defensive. I have been basically begging him to get evaluated for a year and he has refused **every time**. I know I should be supportive but at this point it doesn't even feel like a relationship anymore. I get no support from him, we don't ""share the load"" at all. Instead I have to deal with all of his problems alone on top of mine. It's hard to not feel like his caretaker or mother.

I don't want to break up with him, I love him, I just want him to get better. But he has refused every single form of help I've tried to get him. He doesn't think there's anything abnormal about his behaviour and I just need a way to help him realise there is so he'll actually accept help.

7,1f7l2ee,AITAH for not just giving in to my roommate's request?,"Ok, this is weird to post since (to me) it seems like no big deal.

I live with 2 roommates in a townhouse. We're acquaintances rather than friends, but we keep things cordial. We all generally clean up after ourselves and rotate cleaning common areas. I almost always spend the weekends with my girlfriend, who lives about an hour away.

Around Christmas time, the ""main"" roommate (who has been in the house by far the longest) came to me saying how it's bullshit that he's the one putting out the garbage and recycle bins every week. He said he had done it 4 out of the past 5 weeks (the 5th time was me) and he's getting sick of it. I apologized and said I knew I usually wasn't home when it needs to go out (Sunday nights) but asked about our other roommate, who is almost always there those nights. He said we ""can't really rely on him to do much] and reiterated that it was bullshit. I apologized again and told him I would make a point of coming home Sunday nights every third week to do my part. He said that would mean he's still doing in 2 out of 3 times and I told him to take that up with roommate 3.

For the past several months, this has been working fine. I come home Sunday night and take care of it, though there have been a few times when my roommate has off-handedly mentioned that I was home pretty late, or was about to start collecting the garbage himself when I walked in.

Finally, about a month ago, he spoke with me about his issues. He told me he likes to get everything collected and put by the curb by 6-7pm and it would be respectful of me to make sure I'm home in time to do the same. I told him that I get home as late as I do because I like having dinner with my gf and then hanging out with her a bit after before coming home. Usually the trucks pick the stuff up between 3pm and 4pm on Monday afternoons. Many times, I come home from work and it isn't picked up yet. I told him I didn't see a big issue between it sitting on the curb for 16 hours or 20, and asked him what his reason was for wanting it out at a certain time. He said ""that's when I do it, so that's when you should do it, too. Simple as that."" I told him again that I wasn't going to cut time with my girlfriend short for something that logically doesn't matter one way or the other. He said I was being a ""fucking dick"" and ""selfish.""

The next time it was my turn to put the garbage out, I got home about 9:30 and it was already out. The next afternoon, I asked my roommate and he said ""you got home too late. I told you."" The following week (last week) it was the same thing, but mote condescending and berating. That's when I told him I wasn't going to be coming back Sunday nights to do this anymore. We got in an argument, and basically I told him he was being unreasonable. He called me selfish again and asked ""would it kill you to want to spend a weekend around the house once in a while?"" Which surprised me, because even when we ARE all home, we don't interact a ton.

Anyway, I do feel guilty about not caring about his timeline for things and for kind of blowing up and telling him I wasn't going to pull my weight. At the same time, I feel like I was making a reasonable effort and that didn't count because it wasn't exactly what he wanted. Thoughts?",TL;DR,2024-09-02,"AITAH for not just giving in to my roommate's request? Ok, this is weird to post since (to me) it seems like no big deal.

I live with 2 roommates in a townhouse. We're acquaintances rather than friends, but we keep things cordial. We all generally clean up after ourselves and rotate cleaning common areas. I almost always spend the weekends with my girlfriend, who lives about an hour away.

Around Christmas time, the ""main"" roommate (who has been in the house by far the longest) came to me saying how it's bullshit that he's the one putting out the garbage and recycle bins every week. He said he had done it 4 out of the past 5 weeks (the 5th time was me) and he's getting sick of it. I apologized and said I knew I usually wasn't home when it needs to go out (Sunday nights) but asked about our other roommate, who is almost always there those nights. He said we ""can't really rely on him to do much] and reiterated that it was bullshit.

9,1f7kv10,AITA for holding a grudge with my mom over how she treats my brother and I differently?,"AITA for never being able to get past my mom treating me and my brother so differently? 

Just as the title states, I had a wildly different set of parents that my brother experienced. For a little context, I grew up in a big church. We went two or three times a week for services or volunteering for different things. This was very much a typical big church that’s known to shame women and girls for having any kind of sexual desires and their purity is compared to chewed gum or a damaged package. 

With that in mind, my parents taught me that my purity is the most important thing I can do for myself. This of course lead to a lot of shame within myself any time I had a perfectly normal sexual thought throughout puberty. 

I remember one time specifically where my parents found a note my bf and I were passing, planning to “do the deed” prom night. Well once my mom found it of course it was taken to the extreme. She called my bf parents and we needed up all meeting at church in a small room to talk about why the two of us shouldn’t be having sex. That’s right. His parents, my parents and me and bf all in a circle talking about sex. Super awkward, embarrassing, and only added to the shame I still hold as an adult when it comes to sex. 

Fast forward, I’m out of the house and my brother, who’s 7 years younger than me, is now at the age where the sex talk is relevant. I was already feeling some kind of way because my parents let him go out with friends and stay out late when I was never allowed out past 9 or 10 and always got the 3rd degree about who I was with, where and how long. If someone was there she didn’t like or if there wasn’t a good ratio of girls to guys, I couldn’t go. 

So come Christmas time, I was very shocked to hear my brother received condoms as a gift from our parents. Not only did they never shame him the way they did me, come to find out, they had done more than just gift him protection. They had invited his high school gf to go on vacation with him, the four of them had separate rooms, and she was allowed to stay the night whenever she wanted. 

I had tried to ask about it but at that point I was happily married and moved out of the house for a while, but it still bugs me how they can treat the two of us so differently. When I asked, I only got short answers like, “well he’s a boy” and “it’s different for boys” as if he can’t get multiple people pregnant in a year while I, realistically can only have one full term baby a year.

15,1f7jnzz,AITA for being defensive over body-shaming comments from my mother?,"I am just wondering whether I overreacted about this situation. My bf thinks I was right for what I did but I really need outsider’s perspective.

So I (22F) came back home a couple days ago from a long day at work and cheerfully greeted my mother (54M) as I always do. I go into the kitchen to wash my hands and unpack my bag, when my mother comes into the kitchen and starts hyper-fixating herself on my back rolls that are there from my bra. She’s pretty much gasping at them, saying how they’re horrible and basically starts jabbing her fingers into my back where my rolls are, continuing to berate my physique. 

Just a quick backstory for context, I have a long history of mental health issues as well as struggle with an ED, which I have been dealing with for many years, some worse than others. I am in no way saying this to gain sympathy, I am simply just putting this out there for context. 

I am definitely better mentally than I used to be, but as a result of this, I have put on a significant amount of weight, having gone up 3-4 dress sizes in the last 2 years. It is something I am not proud of and I have days where I will have a breakdown over it, but am actively working towards fixing it. 
I would like to think my mother is somewhat one of the reasons behind my ED. She would constantly body shame me, telling me I needed to lose weight when I was a UK size 10-12/M, and I was put under a lot of pressure academically at the same time.

I usually would keep my mouth shut as it would just make it much worse, and she would turn it onto me no matter what excuses I had. If I talked back, she would get angry, but then would complain I never hung out/talk to her. 

Back to what happened, I finally decided to talk back and defend myself, saying I didn’t care about my rolls and that my bra was doing it since I am a 32 back and quite heavy at the chest so I need a lot of support. She kept nagging at me about it and had to constantly tell her I was fine with having them and they didn’t bother me in which I said dryly. This was my way of hopefully getting her to stop as I very clearly did not want to talk about it. But she then proceeded to take a picture of my back to “show me” how bad they were after my efforts of telling her no, and thats when I lashed out and said I didn’t care and she didn’t need to take a picture in an angry tone. She got super upset and started berating me saying I was aggressive and she can never talk to me because of my attitude and to never speak to her again or address her again. 

This was last Thursday and proceeded not to talk for the whole evening. I left for work the next day and spent the weekend at my boyfriends (which was planned prior to this incident). 
I came back tonight (Monday) after work, dad was also home on his day off and my mum didn't utter a single word to me the whole evening. I tried striking up conversations but he was the only one answering.

So, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITA for being defensive over body-shaming comments from my mother? I am just wondering whether I overreacted about this situation. My bf thinks I was right for what I did but I really need outsider’s perspective.

So I (22F) came back home a couple days ago from a long day at work and cheerfully greeted my mother (54M) as I always do. I go into the kitchen to wash my hands and unpack my bag, when my mother comes into the kitchen and starts hyper-fixating herself on my back rolls that are there from my bra. She’s pretty much gasping at them, saying how they’re horrible and basically starts jabbing her fingers into my back where my rolls are, continuing to berate my physique. 

Just a quick backstory for context, I have a long history of mental health issues as well as struggle with an ED, which I have been dealing with for many years, some worse than others. I am in no way saying this to gain sympathy, I am simply just putting this out there for context. 

I am definitely better mentally than I used to be, but as a result of this, I have put on a significant amount of weight, having gone up 3-4 dress sizes in the last 2 years. It is something I am not proud of and I have days where I will have a breakdown over it, but am actively working towards fixing it. 
I would like to think my mother is somewhat one of the reasons behind my ED. She would constantly body shame me, telling me I needed to lose weight when I was a UK size 10-12/M, and I was put under a lot of pressure academically at the same time.

I usually would keep my mouth shut as it would just make it much worse, and she would turn it onto me no matter what excuses I had. If I talked back, she would get angry, but then would complain I never hung out/talk to her. 

Back to what happened, I finally decided to talk back and defend myself, saying I didn’t care about my rolls and that my bra was doing it since I am a 32 back and quite heavy at the chest so I need a lot of support. She kept nagging at me about it and had to constantly tell her I was fine with having them and they didn’t bother me in which I said dryly. This was my way of hopefully getting her to stop as I very clearly did not want to talk about it. But she then proceeded to take a picture of my back to “show me” how bad they were after my efforts of telling her no, and thats when I lashed out and said I didn’t care and she didn’t need to take a picture in an angry tone. She got super upset and started berating me saying I was aggressive and she can never talk to me because of my attitude and to never speak to her again or address her again.

17,1f7jdth,AITA for asking a woman to teach her autistic son boundaries? ,"My grandmother became friends with a family who a few years ago moved to her same neighborhood, they have a son with autism, he is 16 years old.

I lived my entire childhood with my grandmother and a few months ago I returned to live with her because someone must take care of her because of some problems that happened.

My grandmother has always been really friendly and the boy's mother always goes to her house with her son and his babysitter. I've been doing a few dialogues with them and the guy has started to get more trusting with me. 

He is non-verbal, his way of communicating is touching people and he gets too close for my liking. I don't like physical contact and it bothers me that people don't respect personal space but I try to be respectful. 

When the guy comes up close to rubbing his nose against my cheek (that's how close he gets, it's his way of Communicate) I walk away but he continues following me, his family finds him adorable and they are happy that he is comfortable with me but I am not. 

They even started making jokes that he's in love with me. I'm an adult, there's nothing funny or cute on saying those kind of things. 

I have asked the boy to please keep his distance from me but he does not listen to me, I have tried to make him respect my limits but it does not happen and he even follows me to my room sometimes. 
Anyway, a few days ago I approached the mother alone and told her that I feel uncomfortable when someone gets so close to me, that she should teach him to have limits with some people because in the future that could bring him problems. 

She just said to me ""Sisi, thank you for the advice"" but now I have found out that she complained about me to my grandmother and did not come to visit her because she says she felt uncomfortable that I discriminated her son. 

I really don't think I said anything wrong, in my internship I have worked with people with autism and their families correct those behaviors but even my mother told me that I was wrong so I don't know. 

Edit: Yes, when I feel uncomfortable I leave the room... But I live there and he follows me around even to my room. I can't avoid walking in the house just because they're there, it's the place where I literally live. I think I have the right to be able to walk around the house feeling comfortable, I don't want to live locked up.
I also can't leave the house because I'm in charge of taking care of my grandmother.

He listens and obeys his parents, even his babysitter when they tell him to do or not do something. I've already explained to him hundreds of times about my limits and said clearly 'No' but he doesn't listen to me and his parents thinks it's cute when he follows me, so I had to talk to his mother.

AITA for buying someone’s ticket on the LIRR… context:  He was riding without a ticket, clearly seemed to have some behavioral issues and was giving the conductor a hard time and being rude. After lots of back and forth, the MTA worker (looking exasperated) was on his way to get help assumedly, and I stopped him and said I’ll buy the guy’s ticket.

So while I justified it with the logic 1) I’m helping someone out and 2) I’m fixing the situation for the MTA worker, what ended up happening was that this man loudly disturbed everyone’s train ride for the next 20 minutes before (thankfully) getting off.

26,1f7i96h,AITA for taking my sister's kids to celebrate Easter? ,"     I (34m) took second youngest sister's (Rachel 25f) kids to celebrate Easter this year. Of course, this was a few months ago but I saw her again several days ago at my youngest sister's(Jen) wedding. She brought it up again after months of avoiding each other at family events and I simply brushed her off about it which, according to Jen this ""brought down the life of the the party"".

     Here's what happened: When we were kids, our parents ""canceled"" Easter one year due to our behavior. Wasn't that big a deal since we'd already ate all of our chocolate and emptied our plastic eggs, but Rachel never let it go. Every year after that she refused to eat chocolate or even acknowledge the holiday. It never truly bothered me until she had kids and deprived them of the fun of the holiday. I wouldn't care if she just left out the Easter bunny, or maybe left out the search for the eggs, but she won't even let them celebrate with friends. I couldn't tell you how many times her kids (three kids, I'll call them 1,2,3 for privacy) have been invited to and get excited about some Easter hunt event and Rachel refuses to let them go. No chocolate, no candy, no bunny, no nothing. Yes this is completely the choice of the parent, but depriving her children of this fun? (No, for anyone wondering, this isn't due to any religious beliefs that they don't celebrate)

     This year, Rachel had a business meeting the whole week of Easter and I eagerly volunteered to take her kids in for the week. For Easter, 2 and 3 were invited to an after-school event where they could look for eggs with candy in them, etc. I found the invites on the trash and asked the kids if they wanted to go, after a second's hesitation they estaticly nodded their heads with beaming smiles. At the event, another parent walked up to me asking about why they never went. I said shortly that their mom would rather they not go. After the event, I made it clear to the kids to pace eating the candy. Having never been allowed to go to Easter, they made sure to split the candy evenly between all three of them. One of them had saved enough to last them another week, so when they and Rachel returned home, she eventually saw the candy. Putting two and two together, she blew up at me. I apologized but she's still mad about it and I'm over it.

30,1f7gx98,AITA for wanting an extra wristband at Coldplay,"I went to see Coldplay in Dublin over the weekend. I was really excited to see them again as I saw them in Cardiff last year and had an amazing time. However, when I went to see them in Cardiff my wristband was broken….it was a disappointing part to the night as we were in the top tier nosebleed seats and would’ve had to miss a few songs to get a new band. 

So when I came in the gates in Dublin I grabbed one extra wristband between 4 people. With that some member of the Coldplay touring team came up to us and was really agressive. He said we were ruining the show for everyone and stuck his hand inside my pocket to take the band. He wouldn’t let us explain our reasoning (Cardiff error last year) and accused us of taking seven wristbands. He then kept becoming really aggressive and said you came to see Coldplay not a wristband. I understand that the wristbands aren’t the star of the show but if we’re paying over €150 a ticket I would expect to get a wristband that works.

To avoid confrontation we walked away but he told us to F**k off as we did. 

I know some latecomers didn’t get a wristband due to the amount of broken ones. Surely that is an issue with the Coldplay Performance Team and something that hopefully should be sorted for future gigs.

Once the gig started we were lucky that all 4 of our wristbands worked so we offloaded the extra to someone in front of us who got a broken one. She was so happy that she was able to still take part in the light show.

32,1f7gue2,AITAH for not picking up another dog's crap at a store?,"I just had a super weird interaction at a home improvement store (one of the ones that allows dogs).  I had my dog (a 17# chihuahua mix) on 6 ft leash, choked up to about 4 ft as I was looking at some plants.  After a few minutes I realized a different dog had taken a big crap about 8-10 ft away.  Clearly not my dog as the turds were huge, nothing smaller than a Golden Retriever could have left them.

I found my plants and headed to checkout.  I figured I'd let the cashier know.  I said verbatim ""It was not her (pointing at my dog).  But a dog went to the bathroom over there."" and pointed towards the area.  She grabbed a microfiber cloth and rang me out.  Then said ""I guess you can use this?""  I said ""For what?"" and grabbed my plants.  She got a weird look on her face.  Then I left.

I just can't get her expression out or my mind.  I've never been asked to clean up dog crap in a store as a customer.  Not even my own dogs (although, I do insist on cleaning up after my dog, on the very rare instances when she does have an accident).

35,1f7goh7,AITA for criticising my sister about her staying longer than expected?,"So, here’s the deal. My sister asked me back in August if she could stay at my place for ""a few days"" starting on August 28th so that her friend could stay at her apartment. I said yes, thinking it would only be for a short period, like 2-4 days. I didn’t get a specific timeframe from her, so I just assumed she’d be gone by the weekend.

Fast forward to this week, and I found out from our mom that my sister was still staying at my place. I was shocked and a bit annoyed because I didn’t expect her to be here for so long. When I brought it up to my sister, she got defensive and said I shouldn’t have a problem with it as long as she’s okay with her friend staying at her place for a week.

But the thing is, I felt like the lack of clear communication was inconsiderate. I didn’t realize it would be a full week, and I was hoping to save on water and electricity while I was gone and still let her stay over assuming it would only be for a few days. Plus, her friend staying over indirectly affects me since it means my sister is here longer than I anticipated. So I got hurt when I kind of nitpicked about her friend staying longer than expected and she immediately lashed out saying that I should mind my own business since it is up to her whether she is comfortable with her friend staying over or not. 

And the thing is that I had to ask her how long she would be staying today (after finding out through my mother that she is still staying over). She did not proactively tell me and in a way I can understand her friend booked his ticket yesterday but she could have still communicated this with me instead of lashing out when I criticised her and saying „If you‘re so bothered, then I will stay over at my office“.

To get the picture, it was me, Elle, our other sister, our aunt and uncle and our three cousins. The middle one of the three cousins, Grace (32f) has a daughter Brooklyn(12f). Tyler and Brooklyn were the only kids there. Brooklyn recently broke her ankle, and needs crutches for a few weeks. 

The kids were mostly in the living room, whereas everyone else was in the kitchen/dining room. I didn't think to check on them much because I thought 13 and 12 were old enough to know not to do something super dangerous like break a window, besides, the living room is pretty close to the kitchen. We heard something crash down the stairs, followed immediately by shouting. Everyone's first instinct was the rush into the room, and so we did. We saw Tyler and Brooklyn wrestling over one of the crutches on the couch, well Brooklyn was sitting on the couch and Tyler was standing behind the couch, if you can picture it. Brooklyn ended up falling backwards off the couch, and she started crying. 

Turns out, Tyler had thrown one of the crutches down the stairs into the basement and was trying to also get the other one thrown downstairs. After we made sure Brooklyn was not seriously hurt (she ended up being fine), Grace started asking Tyler things like ""what were you thinking? why would you do that? what's the matter with you?"" I wouldn't call it yelling, but her voice was definitely raised. A few other people joined her, and Elle immediately jumped in front of them like a soldier, saying ""no one is hurt and he's just a kid"". I thought that was ridiculous because 1. Although Brooklyn ended up being alright, she COULD HAVE been hurt, and 2. A 13-year old? Really? A kid? That's a teenager who should know better. So I told her so, just a kid is something used for kids aged 11 and below. After that, it's not an excuse. 

Elle thought everyone overreacted, and she was pissed, especially at me. My god, really? And for anyone asking, I don't know why Tyler did that. Really, I don't. Maybe he thought it'd be funny or something. But since Elle is so pissed off I'm wondering if maybe that was a line not to be crossed. Or maybe I'm overthinking, because wtf.

I love her immediate family, like her brother and her parents. She was having a party this weekend with her family and I said I would go until I realized she was inviting distant relatives. So I told her I couldn't go and got busy.

I didn't want to go because she has told me stories about Indian Aunties and I find them really terrifying and I don't think my mental health can take it.

She said they often comment on her weight. She had an Auntie tell her, ""You are looking more like you wear a large these days."" Which????

38,1f7gd0c,AITA for selling two dolls that my mother gave me?,"I (31F) generally have a good relationship with my mother (67F), but she still sometimes brings up an event that happened almost a decade ago that I frankly feel like she ought to have let go of by now.

When I was a child, after lots of begging and begging, my mother bought me two American Girl dolls. For those that don't know, these are relatively expensive 18"" dolls with historically-accurate clothing and backstories. Each doll is tied to a specific culture and era of history and has her own series of books. I cherished these dolls as a kid, but I grew out of them as I got older, and they ended up in my mom's basement. 

When I was maybe 21 or 22, I struggling to keep up with university expenses and rent. I had a job, but it wasn't enough, and I didn't want to ask my mom for more money. I needed some extra cash quickly. The two dolls were now collector's items, and because they were in such good condition and had all the original accoutrements, I think I made around $400 selling the dolls and some extra clothing and accessories I had for them. This was a significant amount of money for me and I really needed it at the time to pay for college.

When my mom found out, she was *livid*. She cried and treated it like such a betrayal, and that the dolls were so beautiful and precious and I never should've sold them and how much it breaks her heart. I was a bit taken aback; I thought she might've disapproved of me selling them, but didn't think she would be so devastated. After all, it wasn't like she had them on display; the dolls were just languishing in the basement so how was I supposed to know she was so attached to them?

Maybe I was TA back then for selling a gift that obviously had a lot of sentimental value to her that I didn't realize, and I apologized for it. But the thing is, she'll still occasionally bring it up all these years later!

42,1f7frtj,WIBTA if I left my girlfriends house early because of her family?,"I (19, male) and my girlfriend, who I'll call Ashley, (17, female), have been dating for more than half a year now and have known each other for over a year.

I really do like her and I can see it going the distance. We plan on coming out to her parents when she finishes high school this year (they don't even know I exist yet), that I am her boyfriend. 

Her sister, Hannah(fake name), and I are also close friends, and I'm friends with Hannah's boyfriend as well. Hannah has finished school already and is still in the closet about her boyfriend because of how... intense their parents can be, and her boyfriend has also told me how difficult her family is with him at the moment despite them only believing that they're friends and not dating yet. And has on several occasions complained to me about their parents and warned me to just accept whatever it is they may say or do, regardless of how disrespectful it might sound or how upset I may be. He warned me about how they interrogate who you are, what you're plans with life are, what you're currently doing, what's your plans for their daughter and so forth, which I can understand, but he has said that they're a lot more intense about it than what you would think.

Ashley has more than once said that she'd rather put it off until she is older, because she doesn't want to deal with her parents and them potentially saying she must break up with me, because, ""They're unpredictable and anything can put them off you"".

Here's the WIBTA part. I'm grown, and I know many may not see it like that because I'm 19, but I'm done with high school, I have a job and I'm studying part-time and I have my driver's license and other basic adult things, and by law where I stay, once you're 18, you're considered an adult.

So I don't want to be treated and spoken to like a child and just generally disrespected by her parents. You're older than me, yes, but also treat me like an adult, which by law I am. I can handle interrogations and such things, but being bullied and spoken to like a little boy isn't something I plan to just sit through.

2 weekends ago we attended a wedding reception on the Saturday eve and saw all the group of friends. I was working on the Saturday and we went straight after I finished a 10 hour shift. Had a great eve but I was absolutely shattered and just not in the mood for it. Tried my absolute best and put on a smile.

Weekend just gone we were invited to joint the group on Saturday eve at a local camping site where they had all camped out as a fun activity for the kids.

I was set to finish at 6pm and by the time I'd changed and we've driven there it would be at least 7.30 so partner decided to join the. in the afternoon for a few hours and then came home around 7.30 so we got to chill at home together and have a quiet eve after I finished work.

This person did a DNA test and matched as a half-sibling with my brother in the database. The affair was kept secret for 35+ years, literally no one knew but my father and the half-sibling's mother, and the parents also claim they didn't know the child was a result of the affair (this was the mid-80s). My half-sibling had their world upended by this news. They reached out to my father and have had minimal contact with him. They reached out to me and my brother, wanting to form some connection. I have replied to a few online messages, polite but not overly interested, and answered all health and genetic questions my half-sibling has asked.

My whole family is what I'd consider very private and drama-averse. I know in my heart that if my mother finds out, my parents will split up, and the peaceful existence we are fortunate to have with actively involved grandparents, us kids, and grand kids will forever be disrupted. 

My half-sibling continues to try to reach out for a deeper connection to our family. They have gone on a podcast lamenting that we are not opening our arms to them, that their own young child could be blessed to have cousins if we'd only let them. They note it's not their fault they're a secret product of an affair. I agree with that sentiment, and feel for their trauma in dealing with the discovery, but also don't feel it's my responsibility to insert this person into my life.  My half-sibling admits they have a loving family (parents still married, one other sibling who does not have children), but desire a larger family by being included in ours.

I struggle immensely with contributing to this person's struggle and trauma, but also feel protective of my own family. I question if this person could have financially motivated reasons for reaching out, but from what I can see we're all hanging out on a pretty average middle-class level. I fear this person eventually getting frustrated with out lack of reaching out, and revealing themselves to my mother just to blow things up.

45,1f7fdb6,AITA for not reading my parent’s divorce papers?,"My (29F) parents are divorced. I lived with my mom and visited my father every 2 weeks.He had to pay alimony, sometimes he would pay too little or none, he’d pay some back but not all. We really relied on it since it was for food and rent and my mom did not yet have a job.

When I went to Uni my father had to pay me alimony too. I wanted him to continue to transfer the money to my mom since I had my tax/insurance with her. My mom had sued him for the missing alimony and won. He was angry at first but then happy that she had to pay a lot more tax due to it.Eventually he found out my bank details and transfered it directly to me. Same thing happened and he’d miss paying.

Here I might be the AH because I kept bringing this up quite often, but it was a difficult time for us. He did eventually pay everything back so I might be too resentful.

There are other occasions, though, that worsened our relationship gradually.

He’d always wish for expensive gifts; like a 700€ model railway and in turn got me nothing, forgot my birthday or got me something meaningless (M&Ms for my 18th BD)

He'd also blame me for things like not yet calling my granny for her birthday even though I'd have a few hrs later.

So a year ago he wrote me a message stating that he was fed up with me mentioning this alimony thing again in some other context and blocked me. He told me to go look for other people to exploit and that I should be more thankful that I could go to university and do my job thanks to his support and that I was very money-hungry.

I had no way of contacting him but he’d eventually wrote to me a few weeks later that he’d think about letting me back into his life and about forgiving me when I look through the divorce papers to finally see the truth.

So from this first message onwards I basically stopped writing him or visiting him. I cried a lot after this. It was like loosing my father, I don't think I can ever see him the same as before. I felt really miserable.

Looking through the documents feels futile and every contact with him now makes me feel miserable.

I visited a few months after this for his wife's birthday. I wrote down what I wanted to talk about but wanted to do that after the party in private. Unfortunately they left for holidays the next day early in the morning, so we never got to talk it out and he also pretended like nothing had ever happened.  Months later he sent another message blaming me for never writing to him and saying again that if I don't read those documents to see the truth I will have to live with the consequences.

I  fear that my point of view is too one sided but I also feel like my life is better without him and I am not truly seeing myself as the bad guy in this. I also don't feel like I exploited my parents. AITA?

Edit:

I should add a few things:

* He paid only until I finished my education which was years ago. I don‘t live off him and also during university I had a job and I never asked him for money. He simply did not pay what the judge made him pay on time which made it difficult to pay bills.

-My mother was not unemployed, she just earned a lot less than he did. He has a very good salary but tends to spend too much.

* While I did bring up the fact that he left us struggling more than once, it was certainly not often and I never asked him for money, I just felt left alone without him caring what happened to us
* The initiator for this conflict was not me bringing it up in front of him but I talked to my brother about it and he told my father something along the lines (i don’t know what exa). which made him go no contact.
* My brother lives with him and agrees with me, his relationship to him is maybe sometimes worse.

We  also have a half brother that we (his siblings) visit but my father saw him last 14y ago when he was a few months old

* I saw a few of the documents prior to all of this and there is nothing important in it, it seems like a farce
* I did make the effort to go visit him (it’s 6h away) and talk about it with the intention of reading these documents but he pretended like everything was normal until I left. He tends to write mean things but in real life he seems to have forgotten it all. He also never visited me, it was always I who had to make the effort to see or contact him.

I was 16 when I found out about the affair, 17 when the baby was born and I'm 18 now and the baby just turned 1. I went to dad's house for custody for a while after he and my mom separated. I was disgusted by him and really hate what he did, and him as a result. I stopped going when my half brother was born and I just knew I would never love him or be able to enjoy a relationship with him. I don't hate him. He's a baby and he's innocent. But I looked at him and held him and felt nothing even remotely like love or affection. I knew it wasn't good to keep that energy going, especially when my dad was encouraging me to bond with the baby and his (now wife) was trying to call us the cutest siblings and she wanted photos of us. Dad tried to fight the custody stuff and make me keep going until my birthday but a judge said I was too close to 18 to take custody off mom for that.

I haven't spoken to my dad in around 7 months. I saw him in court and that was it. I refuse to have anything to do with him. I just think cheating and an affair like he had (6 years) is disgusting and repulsive.

My grandparents were upset that I didn't fall in love with the baby when I held him. They asked me how I could look at a sweet little baby and not soften and I said I just didn't and I think more time would make me more negative and toxic to the baby than positive. I told them I just wasn't interested in knowing him.

So my half brother turned 1 recently and my grandparents asked dad if they could have a small celebration at his house without him and his wife so I could be there. He said yes. They invited me then and told me it was a way I could have a relationship with the baby without dad. I told them I didn't want that and I wasn't going. They sent an actual invite anyway. Their celebration was Saturday and I didn't go. They called me and texted me all day yesterday crying about me not taking the chance and how it was a birthday celebration and how sweet it could have been.

47,1f7esku,AITA for not waning to give away my clothes?,"I (20f) really love fashion and clothes. I go out a lot with university and friends who also love clothes and fashion. I have a system where I sell things I don’t want anymore on Depop and vinted, so it makes room and funds for things I love. I buy a lot of things second hand too. Anything I have listed to sell I keep in a cardboard box until it sells. 

I have my own place and pay bills and rent. I also have hobbies and social life to fund. I come from a family who has money, but I’ve worked since I was 17 and my family do not pay my university, rent, food or bills or anything. I have been staying at my hometown with my family since July. I brought my box of clothes to sell as things sell well over summer. 

My mum has a friend called “Cass” who has a daughter my age “Ella”. Cass was a single mum, and my mum has always felt for Cass because of this. Ella didn’t have the upbringing I had. Cass and Ella weren’t in poverty or anything, but they were working class where as we are maybe upper middle class in the UK. 

Ella and I have know each other since childhood and had classes together. I hadn’t always found her to be a good friend. One example was going out bowling with the girls from our class and not inviting me because she “didn’t think to”. We ended up going down different paths, as I moved to London and went to university. she got pregnant by her boyfriend and stayed in our hometown. Her baby daddy recently left her for another girl, and denies the baby is his.

My mum found out and immediately empathised with her, and invited her, her baby and her mum over for coffee and a catch up at our house. 

My mum told me on short notice. I was packing an order when they arrived so my Box of clothes was in the kitchen on a chair. They said they were leaving soon, so I went upstairs to the bathroom, when I came down, nobody was in the living room, I heard them in the kitchen and I found Ella with my box of clothes. My mum said that she could have them as I didn’t want them. I pointed out politely that I was actually planning on selling them, and that some had actually been sold and I was about to pack it. Ella got embarrassed, apologised and left. As soon as she left my mum was livid

She pointed out she’s a single mother working minimum wage, and times are tough right now for so many people. She said I wouldn’t understand as I grew up having lots of things. I pointed out that I bought the clothes with my own money which I also worked minimum wage for, and I have a right to want to sell them to buy clothes I want. I said she could have them if my mum wanted to contribute to the clothes I wanted to buy but she said she wasn’t willing to. Why do I have to give things away to someone who hasn’t given a rats ass about me in the past? I want to be clear that I don’t dislike Ella and I understand things must be hard for her, but I don’t really want to sacrifice my clothes to her. 

AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITA for not waning to give away my clothes? I (20f) really love fashion and clothes. I go out a lot with university and friends who also love clothes and fashion. I have a system where I sell things I don’t want anymore on Depop and vinted, so it makes room and funds for things I love. I buy a lot of things second hand too. Anything I have listed to sell I keep in a cardboard box until it sells. 

I have my own place and pay bills and rent. I also have hobbies and social life to fund. I come from a family who has money, but I’ve worked since I was 17 and my family do not pay my university, rent, food or bills or anything. I have been staying at my hometown with my family since July. I brought my box of clothes to sell as things sell well over summer. 

My mum has a friend called “Cass” who has a daughter my age “Ella”. Cass was a single mum, and my mum has always felt for Cass because of this. Ella didn’t have the upbringing I had. Cass and Ella weren’t in poverty or anything, but they were working class where as we are maybe upper middle class in the UK. 

Ella and I have know each other since childhood and had classes together. I hadn’t always found her to be a good friend. One example was going out bowling with the girls from our class and not inviting me because she “didn’t think to”. We ended up going down different paths, as I moved to London and went to university. she got pregnant by her boyfriend and stayed in our hometown. Her baby daddy recently left her for another girl, and denies the baby is his.

My mum found out and immediately empathised with her, and invited her, her baby and her mum over for coffee and a catch up at our house. 

My mum told me on short notice. I was packing an order when they arrived so my Box of clothes was in the kitchen on a chair. They said they were leaving soon, so I went upstairs to the bathroom, when I came down, nobody was in the living room, I heard them in the kitchen and I found Ella with my box of clothes. My mum said that she could have them as I didn’t want them. I pointed out politely that I was actually planning on selling them, and that some had actually been sold and I was about to pack it.

48,1f7eii2,AITA for not moving in with my father in law?,"To start, my wife and I had long conversations about this. My wife's stepmother and father agreed to have us rent 2 bedrooms and pay 1,000 in rent, including all utilities. We agreed to this and I have been looking to transfer my job over to the city they live in. I even scheduled a potential moving date of mid October. Stepmom said we should pay 300 dollars more which we simply can't afford as my wife is full time in college and we have two young kids. Her stepmom told us many times that she is not comfortable to watch my children alone, my wife is unable to work if we move in. Her stepmom has since deleted each message where she says she wants us to pay 1,300 from both her and my wife's phone. She started asking for 1,100 instead. We told her we couldn't do this as we simply cannot afford to pay this much on my paycheck alone. The stepmom then brought up how it wouldn't be fair to my father-in-law to pay electricity, internet and every other bill that comes in with owning a home. We told her we agree he shouldn't have to pay for us. Stepmom texted us that we have to rehome our dog if we moved in with them. She said that she hates dogs and only likes cats, specifically her cat. This was another topic she previously agreed on. We have a husky and she's very energetic but good with the kids. We tried to rehome our dog in the past but that caused serious emotional issues in our son. Our son is developmentally delayed, when realized our dog no longer lived with us he stopped using the toilet altogether and wet his pants. These accidents stopped after the family who took our dog brought her back the following week. From this experience with our son, we decided it would be in his best interest to keep the dog and make training her our primary goal. We told her father this, and he agreed we can take our dog. Meanwhile his wife is sending twenty messages at a time to the chat my wife had already muted. The house my father in law is looking into buying is 5 bedrooms and has a fully fenced yard. My wife loves her dad and she has always wanted to take care of her father as he is getting older and approaching retirement age. She told me that growing up she would wash and iron her father's clothes and ensure dinner was on the table when he got home from work. Things her stepmother doesn't do for her father. Stepmom said that the kitchen and all other living spaces would be hers and we would only have the two bedrooms. She even went as far to tell my wife ""it's my house, you would just be living in it."" We told her we were thinking of backing out completely. The drama is just not worth it and we are scared of what would happen if we actually move in with her.

49,1f7efpd,AITA for not telling my husband's family that I speak their language?,"My husband Peter (29 m) and I (27 f) have been married for about three years. We have one child together and I was pregnant with our second. I’m western Canadian while he is from Germany. We lived in Canada for a long time, but because of inflation moving back to Germany seemed like a better option for us. We bought a nice house in Hannover where Peter is from. 

The day after our flights to Germany we all visited Peter’s family. This was the second time I have seen them (the first was at our wedding). They greeted us and brought us inside of the house, fussing over my son. We had dinner, and soon we left the house, wanting to settle into our new home. We visited Peter’s family often for the next few months. But I had started to realize that they would sometimes speak about me in German. They would make rude comments on my hair and makeup, question my fashion choices, and overall were just very unkind to me. They also said mean things about my pregnant belly which I was already insecure about.

I ended up talking to my husband about this. I told him that I didn’t like the way that they were treating me. I said that I hated how my every choice was judged. He told me that he would talk to his family. 

The next time that we went to his parents house, there were no more mean comments. For about three months it was like nothing ever happened. I gave birth to a perfect baby girl that we named Lilith. Peter’s family was very upset when they heard the name. If you didn’t know, Lilith means “ghost” or “of the night.” We didn’t pick this name because of its meaning, but because it is a name that every girl in my family has had for many years. My middle name is Lilith, along with my moms, my grandma’s, and even my great grandma's. 

For a while I didn’t visit my in-laws. I didn’t want to hear them talk about how I shouldn’t have named my daughter Lilith. But yesterday we saw them again. It was my mother-in-law’s birthday. As soon as we showed up things started to go badly. Everybody wanted to hold Lilith which made my MIL upset because people weren’t paying attention to her and made me overwhelmed. I didn’t want people holding her. I was going through a pretty bad postpartum depression and it was still pretty early to see people. I let people look at her, but declined when anyone asked to hold her.

During dinner I heard my SIL talking to my MIL in German. I heard her complaining about how she couldn’t hold my baby. My SIL even had the audacity to call me, and I quote, “a fat ugly hokey addict.” I turned to my SIL and MIL and told them off in German. I basically said that I have always known what they have said about me, but calling me names was the last straw. I also mentioned how I have known German for almost my whole life. The table instantly blew up. People were yelling at me because apparently this was all my fault. I left with Peter and we haven’t talked to them since. So AITH?

50,1f7e9fb,AITAH for telling my boyfriend I don’t want to spend time with his brother? ,"For some context, I 20 F and my boyfriend 22 M (we’ll call him S) have been together for almost 2 years. We met through my boyfriends brother 20 M (we’ll call him J). J dated one of my close friends and S and I met through them and started dating. A few months into S and I dating, J and my friend had a nasty breakup, and none of us have talked to her since (she cheated). 

Since the breakup, J’s life has gone down hill. He lost his job, had to move back home, and hasn’t worked in about a year and a half.

When the break up first happened, J would hang out with us every once in a while. He might would go fishing with us here and there or if we were out and about, we might would grab a bite to eat. This was fine. I understood that J didn’t have anybody and tried to be mindful of his situation, but fishing and grabbing a bite to eat here and there turned into all the time. 

Now, almost a year and a half later, J comes with us almost everywhere. If I ask S if we can go fishing, they both assume that means J is coming too. We haven’t had a real date night in a long time because J always ends up tagging along. Anytime I am with S and I are with my family, J is calling him every 30 mins to an hour and it’s like physically he’s there, but he’s not present. 

They both have also made jokes that once S and I live together, J is going to move in. At first it was funny, but I’m not so sure that it’s a joke, because we really don’t get any one on one time with each other anymore. 

I don’t want to make it seem like I don’t want J around. Because he is a nice guy and I do like him, but I also value quality time with my boyfriend and would like some time with him without always having someone else with us.

Their kid is profoundly autistic - non-verbal, and spends all day every day screaming, stomping, thumping, banging the walls and screaming some more.

He's 5 and it's been going on for about 2 years, so I assume as soon as he started walking. I asked them (politely) if there's anything they could do to try and keep the noise down.

Their answer was no. ""He just makes a lot of noise, nothing we can do about it"". And this isn't really the point but they were a bit arsey about it. There was no attempt to talk about it, meet me halfway, *try* to figure out something ... just ""too bad"".

So since that day I have been making as much noise as I want to.

Since I started one of the other neighbours - the other neighbours seem to take my side, but they might just be being diplomatic and trying to stay out of it which I dont blame them for at all - anyway one of the other neighbours told me that the kid's mother has been complaining on Facebook about their asshole neighbour (that'd be me) playing loud music.

For a full picture: this kid starts at 6AM (I have to wear earplugs if I want to sleep past 6) and doesn't stop until 9PM. I can tell immediately when he isn't home, but these people do not leave the house much or take their children out like at all, so there has been no respite over the summer. I tried wearing headphones but he hits the floor so loud - I think he repetitively jumps off furniture or something - the thump and the vibration still makes me jump.

I have quite a stressful job and for this to be my home environment is genuinely affecting my health. It's utterly relentless. I can't remember what it's like to be able to sit in peace and quiet and read a book in my own home.

They were basically like ""are you sure you want to be calling in a bad smell, in the bathroom?"" and I just kept saying things like ""you don't understand, what I'm smelling could not have come out of a human, etc"" They got clearly more and more annoyed with me but asked all the obligatory questions like how long have I noticed it, can you describe the smell, etc?

I realized later that, since this was the weekend, the call was forwarded directly to the on-campus police officers instead of the usual dispatchers, and this also happened to come at a time where they were dealing with an all-hands-on-deck emergency at the hospital.

Their hostile reaction to the call has me pretty rattled though, because I honestly had good intentions when I made the call and was not trying to do some stupid prank on the safety people.

53,1f7dnon,AITA for refusing to let my friend open a Tinder account using my phone number,"My friend was banned from Tinder a few years ago. When he told me about this back then, he said he contacted Tinder and wrote a lengthy email asking to be unbanned. They did not lift the ban.

Last night I received an access code via text, which I found odd because I didn’t try to login to any google account anywhere recently. Shortly afterwards, my friend texts me that he tried making a google voice number because it wouldn’t let him use his phone. Then says he’s trying to make a tinder account, but his number was banned some years ago. Then thanks me and says he appreciates it before I even opened his text.

I responded by saying I can’t do that because my google account is tied to my parents’ google family account. Then I tell him that I remember him mentioning he got banned from Tinder a while ago, but he never gave details. I think it goes without saying that he was somehow violating their terms of service. However, what I said to him was it sounds like you’re trying to circumvent the system….sus.

I think it’s worth mentioning he regularly refers to women as b*tches and can come off as rather misogynistic, which personally I find upsetting, disrespectful, and simply uncalled for.

Anyway, he tells me it was a ban that was unjustifiable, but on a deeper level, is a bit ashamed at my attitude because some big corporation banned him, he’s supposed to roll over and simply accept that fate from 7 years ago?

I have NO IDEA what specifically he was banned for, but imagine it must’ve been pretty bad. After politely telling him no, I suggested it might be worth reaching back out to Tinder, acknowledging what he did was wrong and why, explaining how he’s learned from it, and will make sure it never happens again, and then maybe ask if it’d be possible to have his ban lifted.",0.0,0.0232434049248695,0,1
54,1f7dby9,AITA for refusing to babysit my sister's kids after she criticized how I discipline my own children?,"I (32F) have two kids, ages 5 and 7, and my sister (34F) has three kids, ages 3, 6, and 8. We've always been close, and I often babysit her children when she and her husband need a break. Last weekend, my sister dropped her kids off at my house for a few hours, which is something we've done countless times before.

While I was watching all five kids, my 7-year-old started acting up, so I put them in time-out. My sister came back earlier than expected and saw this. She immediately pulled me aside and said she doesn't believe in time-outs and that I was being too harsh on my child. She then went on to give me an unsolicited lecture on how I should handle discipline, saying I should use ""gentle parenting"" instead.

I was taken aback because I've never criticized her parenting methods, even though I don't always agree with them. After she left, I felt really upset. The next day, she asked if I could watch her kids again this weekend, and I said no. I told her that if she doesn't trust my judgment with my own kids, I don't feel comfortable being responsible for hers.

She got really upset and accused me of overreacting. Now, she's not speaking to me, and my parents think I should just let it go for the sake of family harmony.

56,1f7d2pj,AITA for complaining there's nothing to eat at home? ,"I (15) live in a house with my four siblings (17,16,14, and 12) and our mom (37). She works from 9-4 and comes home expecting everything to be clean and dinner to be made. She occasionally makes dinner, but 5/7 days of the week we're eating sandwiches or takeout and it's  really gross to all of us. On days where she ""cooks"" it's our responsibility to meal prep right after school and make sure there isn't a mess when she gets home from work.

 I go to school from 7:40 until 3, getting home around 3:30. When I get home from school, my sister's are doing homework in the kitchen table so when i ask them to help me meal prep and clean up a little they say they can't because they're busy. On the other hand, my older  brother works so he gets home to change and head straight to work, and my oldest brother brings his girlfriend over and they sit on the couch playing videogames. Well, this whole issue escalated last week Tuesday when we had eaten sandwiches for dinner for 3 days in a row already. I told our mom that we were sick of eating sandwiches and she replied with ""There's beans in the fridge and you can make egg or something if you're really hungry"". The beans are weeks old and we eat egg almost every other day. 

On Wednesday she made scrambled eggs for dinner and we ate that, but on Thursday she wanted us to make egg again. Finally, on Friday when I was sick with a fever I couldn't make anything so we got takeout. However, on Saturday my mom and dad went to a party so we ordered takeout again. Yesterday was Sunday I still felt sick, but I made dinner for me and my two sisters and my mom had made a shellfish dinner for my two older brothers, which she knows me and my sisters don't eat, before going to another party with my dad. Our house doesn't have much ingredients, so I just air fried some fries and chicken tenders and i made coleslaw but it was all nauseating to me.

 Today is Monday again and she wanted us to make scrambled egg again. I expressed my anger with this because she was going to AGAIN another party today where they eat food and we're stuck eating dog shit. We have a dog and she doesn't rly eat much either bc we'll, there's nun to eat. Around the house when our parents aren't here it's usually me and my (12) sister doing stuff. My younger sister (14) refuses to acknowledge  that she doesn't do anything around the house by saying that I don't do anything (when I lit make dinner/clean most days). Today I confronted my parents about what we've been eating as they headed out for another party. My sister (14) and brother (17) said it's just me that's complaining but me and my (12) sister have been talking about how nauseating this has been to us.

\[throwaway account for this; this post is not AI-gen\]

This takes some background. I (18M) am not gay. I'm bi. That said, I've only ever been with guys. Everyone who knows me thinks I'm gay. I do like girls, though, I'm just a massive idiot with how to communicate my feelings, and, again, all the girls I know think I'm gay.

This is due to me having never come out myself. Instead, 10th grade, I was seen kissing a guy at a party and a picture went around the entire school and I got made fun of for it for a couple months but then it all kind of died down. It honestly wasn't that bad, but I can imagine it would have been much worse if wasn't as popular a kid as I was in high school. TL;DR everyone thinks I'm gay but it doesn't really matter.

I have a childhood friend, Heather (17F). She has a younger sister, Ellen (15F). Heather is a great friend, and a much nicer sister than she should be, but Ellen is a nasty b1tch.

Years back, Ellen had a crush on Heather's friend Rex. Rex didn't share the feelings so Ellen did something backhanded (won't detail) to humiliate Rex and he ends up moving away. Heather lost one of her best friends to her petty sister.

Fast forward last week. I'm planning a surprise bday party for Tony (18M) and Ellen, myself, and others are making a playlist for the party. Apparently, Ellen had just ""come out as bi"" on her Insta story (which I don't follow). I've known her for many years. She's never crushed on a girl. I'm 99% sure she's straight, and just claiming to be bi as a petty attention grab.

At this point, I had no idea about her ""coming out"". I was trying to design the PL around music that Tony would like, while Ellen wanted to populate the PL with her music (I Kissed A Girl-Katy Perry). I say smth like ""fuck no this party is for Tony"".

Ellen then calls me homophobic and says I'm being insensitive about her coming out as bi. Me, homophobic? A guy who's slept with guys and never been with a girl? The others are now on my side. One girl (Ellen's friend) even laughs and says ""he's gay you know"".

But I'm waaaaay pissed off and I burst out laughing in her face. I tell her ""Girl, you're not bi. Shut the fuck up and quit posing. Be real and grow up."" Her face turns red and I walk out of the room still laughing.

I haven't really been discriminated against for my sexuality, but I have been the butt of (many) jokes for it, and it really pisses me off that Ellen is trying to pose as a minority just as an attention grab.

I've known Ellen for \~9 years and I'm 99.9999% sure she's straight. She's never been interested in a girl and never will be. This kind of twisted attention grab is just the sort of shitty, selfish thing she'd do.

But what if it's the 0.00001% chance that she really is bi? She's only 15 years old, who knows? I'm feeling really bad so help me out here. AITAH?",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-02,"AITA For Laughing in the Face of a Bi Poser \[codenames\]

59,1f7cort,AITA M24 for getting my dad evicted M58?,"Hey everyone buckle in cause there is a fair amount to this story.

Back in 2020 on new year’s day I received a call from my father crying telling me my grandmother had passed away. She was 94 so she lived a good long life plus she always complained about living to be that old. Fast forward to after the funeral, eventually I have to go help my dad fix his phone and reset it due to him messing with it thinking someone hacked his phone (this man knows nothing of electronics but is great with old cars). I find out from my aunt what was in the will, the 3 kids got an even split of my grandmothers assets. In total minus the house, the assets were close to 800k-1 million from what I’ve seen. An important note is my father has lived with my grandmother basically since my parents separated when I was 11.

Through the final years of my college my father lost it more mentally, I'm still not sure if its from drugs or some mental disorder but he believed people were hacking everything he had and fucking with him (another note is this man did not have wifi at all). He would claim his smart tv with no internet access was being hacked so on and so forth. 

Fast forward to 2023 I had lost my job and wanted to move back home due to moving out of state for said job. Against my better judgment I reached out to my dad and explained what had happened, he offered to let me stay there rent free just help him fix up the place. All he mentioned was that house was a little dirty, needed yard work, painting inside, changing outlets, and repairing the fence. So I said fuck it and moved back.

When I arrived the place was a mess, there was trash piled in the house, the kitchen was unusable due to him not doing dishes and leaving food out. The washer was broke, the fridge didn’t work and had months old rotting food in it, same with the outside freezer. Most of the windows had black trash bags over them to “block out heat during the summer” because he has destroyed the furnace and A/C.  He wasn’t even sleeping in one of the bedrooms, the room he lived in for years just had cloths on his bed he never folded. He was sleeping on a twin bed in the living room surrounded by trash and smoking cigarettes on it. He was using coolers filled with ice to keep his food and drinks cold. 

In the 2 months that I was there before I got another job my father basically slept and didn’t do anything. I got trash service and internet to the house so that I could apply to jobs and clean a bit during that time. So showed my aunt all the shit my father had done to the house. Fast forward to last month, my aunt sent an eviction court date to my dad, with the 12th as the date. He didn’t show up and claimed he thought it was the 19th, so instead of taking it seriously and getting some actual time he got 10 days to leave. So AITA?

61,1f7bgui,AITA for sending ss of a private convo to new gc? ,"My entire school life I spent it with the same group of 5 people, But that group had constant fights, for example A would date B,they break up and B would date  C

And then A would talk shit about both of them, after B and C break up it's like nothing ever happened and they'd hang out again

we had poster making,A forgot to do hers, she told me of I were really her friend Id pass my work as hers

I was grouped with two people that introduced me to a new friend group,Jake and Kayla,We hanged out with the new friend group after a while,there's more people now

We got Jake, Kayla, Ria, Carl, Henry and now me

For the first time in years I genuinely laughed with these people,they didn't do many things that my old friend group did

They didn't talk shit about one another behind backs,They actually asked each other for permission when they would use each others stuff and they would talk to me for fun and not just text me to vent

They were just a bunch of kids who liked what they liked and surrounded themselves with people who liked them and vice versa

I'm so happy for the first time I got to talk about my interests and not be interrupted,if I am interrupted,the person would stop talking and apologize for interrupting me and tell me to continue,my old friends would just ignore me

We were at the mall one time and I accidentally spent too much,my money to go home was not enough

This had happened to me before and my old friends just told me goodluck

But this time,me and my friends sat down on the steps of the mall and Ria pulled out some money,they all pitched in so I would have enough money to go home

And in one instance Henry borrowed money from me,a few days later we all went to the mall again and I overspend again

Then Henry told me he didn't actually need my money from that time and he hid the money at a back pocket of my bag,I had money to go home

the problem came when Friend E got into a fight with Jake,Jake and E were seated near together during a test,E wanted some answers and asked Jake,Jake didn't give him answers and even told the teacher

E was so angry that he private messaged me to placed his vape inside of Jake's locker and tell the teacher that Jake was vaping on school grounds

I took screenshots of it and sent them to the gc,they were angry

Okay some background about Kayla, she loves us about and she's very protective, She told me to do what E said,so I placed E's vape Jake's locker

The principal found out then Kayla showed the ss between me and E about Jake

Kayla knew I could get in trouble for being an accomplice so she said that the convo was between her and E and she was guilty for getting Jake in trouble

So Kayla was suspended for helping to frame someone and E was expelled for vaping on school grounds and framing someone

I was bombarded with messages from old group,I blocked them all,they called me a backstabber and a fake friend

So am I the asshole?",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-02,"AITA for sending ss of a private convo to new gc?  My entire school life I spent it with the same group of 5 people, But that group had constant fights, for example A would date B,they break up and B would date  C

And then A would talk shit about both of them, after B and C break up it's like nothing ever happened and they'd hang out again

we had poster making,A forgot to do hers, she told me of I were really her friend Id pass my work as hers

I was grouped with two people that introduced me to a new friend group,Jake and Kayla,We hanged out with the new friend group after a while,there's more people now

We got Jake, Kayla, Ria, Carl, Henry and now me

For the first time in years I genuinely laughed with these people,they didn't do many things that my old friend group did

They didn't talk shit about one another behind backs,They actually asked each other for permission when they would use each others stuff and they would talk to me for fun and not just text me to vent

They were just a bunch of kids who liked what they liked and surrounded themselves with people who liked them and vice versa

I'm so happy for the first time I got to talk about my interests and not be interrupted,if I am interrupted,the person would stop talking and apologize for interrupting me and tell me to continue,my old friends would just ignore me

We were at the mall one time and I accidentally spent too much,my money to go home was not enough

This had happened to me before and my old friends just told me goodluck

But this time,me and my friends sat down on the steps of the mall and Ria pulled out some money,they all pitched in so I would have enough money to go home

And in one instance Henry borrowed money from me,a few days later we all went to the mall again and I overspend again

Then Henry told me he didn't actually need my money from that time and he hid the money at a back pocket of my bag,I had money to go home

the problem came when Friend E got into a fight with Jake,Jake and E were seated near together during a test,E wanted some answers and asked Jake,Jake didn't give him answers and even told the teacher

E was so angry that he private messaged me to placed his vape inside of Jake's locker and tell the teacher that Jake was vaping on school grounds

I took screenshots of it and sent them to the gc,they were angry

62,1f7b995,AITA for not reacting 'appropriately' to my best friend's dad's death,"A few weeks ago my (F36) best friend (F36) reached out panicking because her dad was in the hospital for some sort of heart failure. Now, her dad was not a good person. She cut all ties with him when she turned 18. A few years ago she was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (and I with depression). Recently she was diagnosed with being on the spectrum and with ADHD. 

When she told me about him dying I wasn't too sure how to react but was trying to be supportive and listen to her. Her texts made it sound like she was very worried and I thought that maybe she wanted to see him before it was too late. 

She then literally told me that I was not doing what she expected of me. That she DGAF about her dad, she never wanted to see him again, she only wanted to know if she was going ""to have to go back to that god forsaken house"". 
I was hurt by her text because I felt I was trying to be supportive. So I tried to explain and also I couldn't guess what she wanted solely based on her texts. I said I didn't think she needed to go to his house if she didn't want to. And added that even though she doesn't care about her dad, her brother does, and he will need her when the time comes. 

She didn't respond to that so I thought she was upset and decided to leave her space. After a while I reached out again which I was afraid of doing because I could feel it not going well. I asked if she was upset and I wasn't sure where it went wrong but I never meant to hurt her and that I was very sorry. She took a few days to respond and today she sent a nasty text.
She told me that she wasn't upset but fucking angry. 1 because I was telling her again how to live her life. 2 because her dad died and now her half siblings (whom she never talks about) are going to fight over the will. 3 because I didn't read her texts attentively to read between the lines. 4 I don't actually know what her life in that house was so I cannot understand. 5 No, my words don't have ""the power to upset people"" + summarized things that I did wrong. 6 she just spent time and energy responding to someone like me. 

When I read that I thought I was going to puke. I have been crying all day. I didn't ask about her dad because I naively thought she'd tell me. I also was scared of asking because I want didn't want her to react negatively. This whole time it felt like waking on eggs. I really wasn't sure what to do and genuinely thought she needed a supportive ear.

I haven't replied to her yet. I feel like her text was mean and uncalled for. Never in my life have I ever spoken to someone like that. I feel like I'm not allowed to have flaws. My cautiousness wasn't good enough. I feel so awful I never want to speak to another human again for fear that I'm going to say the wrong thing or be disappointing. I messed up.

My husband thinks she's emotionally unstable and is taking her anger and sadness on me.

63,1f7b1gb,AITA for not caring for my mum?,"Me (45) had never had a good relationship with my mum(70). She wasn't the caring kind, we basically grew up pretty much on our own, she made sure we didn't starve to death, that's all. We took care of ourselves regardless sick or injured, as she would say it's no big deal and we are not going to die from it. We were told to stay away from her so we wouldn't pass any viruses to her. We (my siblings and I) have all got married and have our own homes.

Couple of years back, I had a minor surgery done and was warded in the hospital for 2 nights. I called her, and her response was it's a small thing, no big deal and she's not coming to visit me in the hospital. We live in a small area, the hospital is less than 30 minutes drive from her place.

Recently I was diagnosed with cancer, had a major surgery to remove all the cancer cells, and I didn't tell her about it since she would probably have the same reaction. My siblings thought that wasn't right, she had a right to know since she is our mum, so they told her. And just as I expected, she said it's not a big deal, so she did not visit me in the hospital, nor called, nor texted me at all. Total silence. Not that I was expecting anything from her anyway.

So right now she's down with something, feeling really unwell for days but refuses to see a doctor. She doesn't trust doctors nor hospitals and everyone is worried cos she seemed to be in pain. At this point I honestly don't feel a thing, I don't hate her, nor love her. She's just like another person in my life that I don't have much emotional connection with.

My siblings think I'm cold and spiteful for all that my mum did (or did not do). My spouse thinks I'm heartless. Even my kids tell me that I should at least go see her ""just because she is your mum"" (despite 99% chance of being kicked out of her house if I'm ever going to mentioned anything about seeing a doctor)

I work 2 jobs but still struggle since a lot of unfortunate circumstances have happened. My bf has been trying to find a job but I feel like his ego is too high to ask for help but his motivation is low so he lets a lot of opportunities pass. It’s been a few times where he doesn’t go to interviews because he would rather sleep or because he doesn’t have new clothes. Today it was because I didn’t have enough money for his Ubers and he didn’t want to use my uncle for a ride even though it was an option. I did put 100 dollars in my account 3 days ago but it got drained for food and he used it for his Spotify and his other personal things. It’s hard finding time to go to the bank with my schedule and to find someone that is willing to take me when I need. I tried to put money in 2 atms this morning but neither worked. I planned on asking my uncle to cashapp me but he couldn’t and offered to take him instead. He didn’t like those options and refuses to go. He keeps blaming me like i didn’t try at all and that I just forgot about the money. I don’t see why he can’t just get a 10 minute ride.

He is the type of guy who gets attention wherever we go. He works out almost every day, has a great sense of style, and even tailors his own clothes. To be honest, he’s incredibly good-looking, and I can see why he’s confident about his appearance.

However, lately, he’s been asking me for compliments about his looks, which I find kind of weird. At first, I would give the occasional ""you look nice today"" when it was warranted, but now he often says things like ""Do you think this outfit makes me look good?"" or ""Can you tell me I look good?""

I get that compliments can be nice, but if I start praising him too much, he might become overly vain.

Usually he just blatantly fishes for compliments and I sidestep it, but recently he's been demanding I praise his looks/figure. It was more pathetic than anything else, and I laughed it off. He looked more stung by that then I thought he would be and has been sulking all day.

68,1f7aids,AITAH for wearing an “over the top” outfit to my friend’s birthday party and overshadowing the host?,"Before I begin English is not my first language, so apologies for typos, bad grammar and punctuation. I’m also on mobile and using a throwaway just in case.

So last Friday night my(24m) friend (we’ll call him Peter) celebrated his 28th birthday. His coworker (that is what he refers to her as) “April” offered to organize and host the party. The dress code was as she put it “Your gothic best” - Peter loves anything morbid and macabre so it would fit his taste perfectly. 

Now I prioritize comfort over looks, which leaves me dressing mostly in scrubs at work  or sweats and hoodies when I’m out and about. Hence April decided to remind me multiple times in increasingly condescending tone to “follow the dress code”. So I did just that. I wore a black velvet trouser and waistcoat set with a white 18th century men’s shirt (a “pirate” shirt if you will). All of these items I  made completely myself: from drafting the patterns to sewing the shirt completely by hand and adding an embroidery moth across the back of the waistcoat. 

Now, to the party itself. I ended up arriving later than most people due to being held up at work longer than expected. I warned both Peter and April about it: Peter said it was no problem at all, but I better show up and April left me on read. So I arrived 40 minutes late greeted April, congratulated Peter and gave him his gift. Moctails were drank and pleasantries were exchanged. Over the course of the night I got a lot of compliments on my outfit and my craft skills were a topic of conversation several times over the evening - it also didn’t really help that when someone asked me where I got the suit or shirt from Peter would loudly tell then all about how I made everything myself. I remember being spun around a couple of times so people could look/ touch the embroidery in the back. Everyone had a good time, or so I thought. 

Over the weekend April and her friends ended up bombarding my phone and any social media that they could find with absolutely nasty messages. How I was an attention seeker, how desperate I came across, how I absolutely ruined the party April had been planing for weeks, how dare I steal attention away and overshadow Peter and April. You get the idea. 

I feel like I’m going a bit insane - overshadowing anybody was never my intention (especially my friend at his own party) and I don’t think that I did. But all of these comments are making me rethink my choices. So am I the asshole here? I really need some outside perspective. 

Update: This morning showed Peter the post and all of the messages from April and co. Never heard him be this angry. Said he’ll “deal with them”. 

Turns out April is a pathological liar and had been telling everyone in the office that Peter and her are in a relationship, but are keeping it low key. She also was taking pictures of him every time she walked by his office and showing them to her friends as “proof”. So her friends thought that I was trying to steal her man. They aren’t even coworkers- she just greets clients at the front desk at the firm Peter work at. Peter ripped her a new one, their boss (April’s uncle) ripped her a new one, the coworker she lied to ripped her a new one. April ended up throwing a tantrum, police were called. 

The results: April is currently on a 48hour hold. Peter is moving to work from home full time. I got apologies for April’s uncle, mom and a few friends and coworkers.

Peter ripped her a new one, their boss (April’s uncle) ripped her a new one, the coworker she lied to ripped her a new one. April ended up throwing a tantrum, police were called. 

The results: April is currently on a 48hour hold. Peter is moving to work from home full time. I got apologies for April’s uncle, mom and a few friends and coworkers.

69,1f79a55,WIBTA If I tell off my husband's family? ,"My husband died of cancer almost five months ago. He was diagnosed July before last and passed in April of this year. It's been... a very hard year. He was 44.

He was estranged from his family most of his adult life, but got in touch last January after we discussed what to do with his remains if he didn't make it. He wanted his ashes to be spread, in part, on his family land. I asked him to get in touch with his people because it would be uncomfortable if I, a near stranger, showed up one day to tell everyone he had died and not have answers for anyone. But hey! Let me spread his ashes, ok? So he did, and they patched up things as best they could. 

I got in touch with his people when it looked like he wasn't going to make it and said if they wanted to see him, he was willing, and now was the time. Everyone came down, I helped them as much as I could and felt everyone had done their best to patch up relations, or at least as much as you can. It was all hugs and love to him, thank yous to me for making it possible and caring for him (which sounds silly, he was my partner for over 10 years). 

His family and I had a conversation about his ashes, I offered to have them split in two boxes and give them one, also they were getting his Jeep, some other beloved items, art, family heirlooms, pictures, and my husband had put aside money for his two nephews college. They're nowhere near going, but we opted out of kids and he held no animosity toward his sister, he wanted her kids to have a better shot than either of them had. We live a few states away, but their family business would easily move everything. 

I have \*never\* had a harder time giving away money in my life. I've gotten a few texts, no calls, one post on socials with photos of him as a kid and... that's it. I message about once a month, politely asking how everyone is and gently trying to lead to when they're coming for his things. I'm getting anxious. His ashes are sitting there like a kid forgotten to get picked up after school. His jeep sits in the drive staring at me every time I come or go. I've boxes packed for them sitting next to the door and check ready. 

I'm leaving our house in December, and I know that seems a long way off, but I've decided to sell my business and place here, time moves quickly and I've got a lot to do. I'm afraid I'll never hear from these people again. 

Would I be the asshole if I just paid for everything to arrive on their front lawn? Or... would I be the asshole if I called and started yelling at everyone first? Also... would I be the asshole if I said fuck it, kept the money, passed out his possessions to people who actually cared and just forgot them?

70,1f791sg,AITAH for selling a vehicle with rebuilt title and informing the buyer when he came to look? ,"This might be how much of an asshole am I. I feel like a piece of shit. I sold a vehicle with a rebuilt title. I didn't put that in the ad, but I informed the buyer when he started loading the Jeep on the trailer BEFORE he signed the title. Whole time from beginning inquiry to end of transaction was maybe 3 hours.
 

They looked the Jeep over and decided it was worth it. It was 1989 Jeep YJ, largely rust free, running, driving, for 3500. I live about 30 min away from the Georgia border, and so did the buyer. I didn't really know he was titling the Jeep in another state, but I guess I kinda figured since he was coming from there, but I thought maybe he was just passing through since he was already driving when he called. And I never had a problem with the rebuilt title in mine, especially considering its very old vehicle with many owners, comes with the territory, and the last owner did not inform me. 

Now in the shitty used car world, especially in rural North FL, what you see is what you get. You go to Bubba's property, look at his truck, and he's going to stand silent with arms crossed across his gut, and he's not going to divulge more than you ask about. I've been screwed in the past buying and selling used vehicles and Southern niceness and feigned ignorance before, but now I overcompensated.

After informed, they talked of an inspection process they’ll have to deal with, and I looked it up later and it seems Georgia does a safety inspection. The Jeep would need a horn button to pass and replace a couple of bulbs at least. That's the part that makes me feel bad.

 
The only thing that makes me feel better is I really didn't think it was a big deal, they loaded the Jeep really fast, I sold it at a loss and below market value, and I did very clearly point at the title where it shows rebuilt.

72,1f78ojp,AITA for suggesting my family host Christmas morning? ,"AITA for suggesting my family host Christmas this year?

Throwaway. My family is complicated. I have two stepkids, my husband has 50/50 shared custody. My husband and I have a 1 year old. My parents are divorced, his are not. 
Christmas has become a logistical nightmare. We switch the holiday with BM- one of us gets Christmas Eve day, then the kids go to the other house for Christmas Eve and Christmas morning, and switch again around lunchtime. Typically, we’re celebrating Christmas for like a full week. We’ll see one of my parents on the 23rd or 27th or something with the kids. Then we’ll see my other parent on Christmas Eve, and go to my in-laws before or after that because that’s when they pick up my FIL’s mother. Then, if we have the kids for Christmas morning, we go back to my in-laws in the morning and then back to one of my parents’ houses for the rest of the day. If we don’t have the kids in the morning, we go to one of my parents’ then meet the kids at my in laws. Then we have to have another “Christmas” with whichever one of my parents we saw on Christmas morning because they didn’t get to see my stepkids and want to have a Christmas with them too. It’s exhausting. The kids don’t get to enjoy their gifts because we basically show up somewhere, unwrap presents, eat if we’re eating there, then have to pack up and leave. They can’t get hardly anything out of boxes because it makes packing it up a nightmare. We’re all run ragged by the time it’s over and because of where everyone lives, it ends up being like 4 hours of driving around. 

So this year my husband and I thought we’d offer to host EVERYONE on Christmas morning. Everyone can be together and spend a decent amount of time together, the kids can play with their gifts, we could all relax a bit. That would also give all of the grandparents the opportunity to spend our son’s first real Christmas morning with him because last year he was only a couple of months old- essentially a cute sack of potatoes. We thought this would be a nice compromise for everyone. 

My mother was on board and said she’d be happy to, and would help with whatever we needed. My MIL though… she had a meltdown. She started crying and said I was trying to take the holiday away from her and was taking away Christmas morning at grandma’s away from my stepkids, and that I only cared about making things easier for me. I was honestly taken aback. Yes, this would make the day easier for me and my husband, but it would also mean everyone could spend more time together, the kids could enjoy their gifts on actual Christmas, and the baby wouldn’t be screaming from being overtired like last year. I get hosting is important to her, I don’t want to discredit her feelings, but it feels unfair to me for her to expect our whole family to haul around all day, cut time with everyone short, and not get to really enjoy the holiday so that we can be in her house.

73,1f78erh,AITA for not inviting my friends and their kids,"My (36F) friends (33F-39F) nearly all have children now. I have no children. 

We are a fairly large group of 12 and most people have at least 2 children, some 3/4 and one even has 5. As you can imagine this makes the group including the children pretty big and at times chaotic. A couple of the children are also very badly behaved and their mums don't seem to attempt to control their behaviour in any way letting things get damaged or ruined like food and property. 

We've always met often to do meals and outings together and now that nearly every member of the group is a mum the meet ups are child friendly. I actually don't mind this, I enjoy spending time with the children who are mostly well behaved, but of course it does mean understandable child related things happen, a mess is made, it's loud, chaotic, the food needs to be child orientated, can't do certain things, conversations are difficult with things going on with the children. So things are understandably different but then on top of that the badly behaved ones do cause a lot of actual issues.

As well as going out everyone hosts at their house too once in awhile taking turns to do it and as everyone else has children their homes are accommodating to having children over. Even so things do still get dirty and damaged. I used to always host too doing my fair share but I however haven't hosted in years now since the group became child orientated as my home is not really child friendly and I'd need to change so much overnight to accommodate this many children and ensure nothing valuable gets damaged, hour the carpet and walls and furniture can't exactly be removed. I also find the gatherings are extremely stressful and over stimulating to me and I'd find it really difficult to have that in my own house. I just don't feel it's worth my while to host when I don't fit that lifestyle, I imagine when I have my own children my lifestyle and house would change to fit that and then I'd feel able to do this more comfortably. It's also not an option to host without their children as it's become the status quo that our meet ups are with children and everyone would be offended if I was the only one to say it's a child free event. 

Recently one of the friends made some underhanded comments that I don't host anything and do my turn anymore but come to everyone else's events. I didn't know what to say as she's right but I feel like I'm in a very different position.

Edit - At each gathering all of us brings food and helps clean up after, so the host is not actually the one doing all the food, it's just their house is the ""venue"" on their turn.

Once, we literally walked in a club and she was like ""oh god, I need to be careful, every man here is looking at me""... Also, a few weeks ago we we were talking on a bench and a guy on a motorbike drove by and waved at us. He was driving fast, there was no way you could tell who he was waving at but she loudly said wow, ""why was he waving at ME?"" Similarly, we went out for a party and the photographer took a photo of us, said beautiful, and she immediately said ""THANK YOU"" as if she had to be talking about her. I find it quite rude and it's almost like she's trying to insinuate any compliment or interaction must be about her. However, it gets worse as she constantly references ""her looks"" claiming she must be careful where she travels as she's so ""hot"" she will be worried. I mean. Is there any need to act like that? I'm beautiful too but I don't act in such a cringe way. Her sister even tries to humble her sometimes but nothing can knock her ego. I believe it's coming from an insecurity about her height. I think a lot of people try to reassure her and compliment her about her looks because her insecurity is so obvious but it just fuels her behaviour. I only really noticed her putting me down in subtle ways recently, she made a joke about me being short because I'm 5'3 but I am happy with my height. I'm getting to the point where I genuinely don't really want to hang out with her because the sly digs and the constant boasting is becoming gross. So I recently didn't invite her to a few events and she went all quiet so I'm assuming she's upset about it. I would explain to her why but it's all quite awkward how can I say I don't wanna see her because she is insecure and arrogant? AITA?",1.0,0.0188120733946561,0,0

Names changed ofc.

Joanna moved in a few weeks ago and keeps mostly to herself. Before Joanna a guy (M29 Josh) lived in that room. Mary and Josh were close friends. Spending every evening together watching movies, playing games ect. I on the other hand am more of an introvert and prefer to spend time by myself if I am out of energy. I made that very clear in the beginning before I moved in that I like to do my own things after a day of working and studying.

So Josh moved in with his GF a while back and we found Joanna to move in. Joanna and Mary are not close. But Mary and I are somewhat close and she approached me a few times to do stuff. On the weekend sure. But during the week I usually refuse.

Queue forward to Friday. I had a long day. Writing my thesis atm and most of my evenings I spend in the laboratory to finish my experiments and summarize my findings. Friday was such a day. I come home and I still was wearing my shoes and Mary jumped into the floor being like ""Let's play Monopoly!"". I was in a bad mood bring hangry after missing both my busses so I said no.

77,1f785ke,AITA for suggesting my family host Christmas this year?,"Throwaway. My family is complicated. I have two stepkids who I love dearly, my husband has 50/50 shared custody. My husband and I have a 1 year old. My parents are divorced, his are not. 
Christmas has honestly become a logistical nightmare. We switch the holiday with BM- one of us gets Christmas Eve day, then the kids go to the other house for Christmas Eve and Christmas morning, and switch again around lunchtime so that we all get to spend time together. Typically, we’re celebrating Christmas for like a full week. We’ll see one of my parents on the 23rd or 27th or something with the kids. Then we’ll see my other parent on Christmas Eve, and got to my in-laws before or after that because that’s when they pick up my FIL’s mother. Then, if we have the kids for Christmas morning, we go back to my in-laws in the morning and then back to one of my parents’ houses for the rest of the day. If we don’t have the kids in the morning, we go to one of my parents’ then meet the kids at my in laws. Then we have to have another “Christmas” with whichever one of my parents we saw on Christmas morning because they didn’t get to see my stepkids and want to have a Christmas with them too. This is exhausting. The kids don’t get to enjoy their gifts on Christmas because we basically show up somewhere, unwrap presents, eat if we’re eating there, then have to pack up and haul over to the next place. They can’t get hardly anything out of boxes because it makes packing it up a nightmare. We’re all run ragged by the time it’s over and because of where everyone lives, it ends up being like 4 hours of driving around. 

So this year my husband and I thought we’d offer to host EVERYONE on Christmas morning. We’d make breakfast, and everyone can be together and spend a decent amount of time together, the kids can play with their gifts, we could all relax a bit. That would also give all of the grandparents the opportunity to spend our son’s first real Christmas morning with him because last year he was only a couple of months old- essentially a very cute sack of potatoes. We thought this would be a nice compromise for everyone that would mean we could all spend more time together. 

My mother was on board and said she’d be happy to, and would help with whatever we needed. My MIL though… she had a meltdown. She started crying and said I was trying to take the holiday away from her and was taking away Christmas morning at grandma’s away from my stepkids, and that I only cared about making things easier for me. I was honestly taken aback. Yes, this would make the day easier for me and my husband, but it would also mean everyone could spend more time together, the kids could enjoy their gifts on actual Christmas, and the baby wouldn’t be screaming from being overtired like he was last year. I get hosting is important to her, I don’t want to discredit her feelings, but it feels unfair to me for her to expect our whole family to haul around all day, cut time with everyone short, and not get to really enjoy the holiday so that we can be in her house. She doesn’t do anything that’s like, a particular tradition that the kids would miss out on, and I know my children don’t care what house they’re in to open presents. I also think they’d absolutely love everyone being gathered in one place- they adore that about their birthdays, for example.

79,1f77u6i,AITA for expecting my GF to put up with my elderly dog's incontinence?,"So my nearly 16 year old labradoodle, who I've had since she was a puppy, has been getting progressively shakier on her hind legs because of arthritis. She's on pain meds, still has a great appetite and is otherwise healthy and up and moving, albeit a little bit slower since her age. But she's having bouts of incontinence, giving no indication she needs to go outside before pooping. What's worse is that because of her arthritis, she'll sometimes fall back in the middle of her business and can mash into it as she thrashes around to get up. It's all on vinyl flooring so she's not creating any permanent stains, and it gets thoroughly disinfected/cleaned asap. But my GF has had enough. 

When we met, she was a single mom of three. She knew that I didn't really want kids, but I accepted them anyway. We moved in and bought a house together and have been together for four years. As a single guy with just my dog, my lifestyle and household responsibilities have had to change tremendously -- I'd say far more than hers. I do most of the cooking, cleaning and house projects, so her life has gotten far easier in the relationship. Which is why we've been having blowout fights because of my dog's accidents. 

Of course I think it's disgusting when it happens, and i'm not thrilled cleaning it up on a nearly daily basis, but I think GF's outrage when it happens is an oversized reaction. Besides a gross sight and smell until it gets cleaned, there's no permanent damage. The problem is that she works from home, so if it happens when i'm at work, she either has to clean it herself, or live with the smell until i can get home to clean it. 

We've tried leaving her outside for hours in the morning, changing her dinner time, using diapers (the poop somehow still got out), but she inevitably still poops in the house. The current fight is me telling her to stfu after suggesting I put my dog down. I was incensed at her lack of patience and compassion for a dog i've had longer than she's had her kids.

My father was awarded primary custody of me which became sole custody over time. I really only remember one visit with my mom and she was really sick.

We know her parents, her four siblings and her all suffered with their mental health and likely the same one. It's also believed her great grandparents were mentally ill too but she never knew them. I never knew anyone in her family.

I told them she can't save me from mental illness. That they can't ignore the problem and think it won't happen. They tried to stop me but I kept going until I made it very clear how angry I was and how I would blame them if I got so bad it was harder to treat. They were madder than I ever saw them.

They saw me searching my mom's name online last week and they told me to drop it and stop disrespecting my real mom, the woman who raised me and is the reason I am who I am. They said I keep looking for ways to push her away. And I lost it. I started screaming that she's not my mom, she will never be my mom, she didn't pass her DNA on to me and it's not her medical history that's relevant to mine. I told them she can't save me from mental illness. That they can't ignore the problem and think it won't happen. They tried to stop me but I kept going until I made it very clear how angry I was and how I would blame them if I got so bad it was harder to treat. They were madder than I ever saw them. Especially because the other kids were in the house and heard everything.

84,1f777ia,AITA for suggesting we split the inheritance evenly,"I (39F) am one of four sisters, and our father passed away without a will. He owned two properties: a house where my sister Noel (37F) lives with her family, and a commercial property. We live in Japan.

Noel and her husband moved in with our father 16 years ago due to financial issues. As his health declined, she became his primary caregiver, paying no rent or utilities. After his passing, we discovered he had left behind debt, though the mortgage was cleared upon his death.

We initially agreed to split the commercial property equally among the four of us. Our accountant suggested Noel inherit the house and land to reduce inheritance taxes, given that she had lived there for over three years. Noel assured us that, though the house would be in her name for tax purposes, it would remain a family home, and we could still use it if needed. We also agreed that income from the commercial property would cover property taxes.

I supported this plan but wanted to ensure decisions about the property stayed within the four sisters, avoiding complications with husbands and children. I emphasized that their children and husbands would still receive their fair share, but wouldn’t be involved in decision-making. My sisters disagreed, believing it would simplify things if they could leave their share to their children or husbands.

Later, we found out we wouldn’t have to pay inheritance tax, so I suggested splitting the house four ways, using life insurance to cover taxes. Noel was upset and Sam (36F) sided with Noel, arguing she deserved the house for caring for Dad. I'm concerned that if Noel remarries and passes away before her new husband, he might have rights to the house.

Noel offered to write a contract stating the house would go to her children, but I argued that if we're using commercial property income for taxes, it’s only fair all four sisters have a share. This disagreement has caused significant tension, with Noel accusing me of not understanding the situation and insisting we stick to the original plan.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITA for suggesting we split the inheritance evenly I (39F) am one of four sisters, and our father passed away without a will.

I (21F) have a dog named Charlie who means a lot to me. My sister (28F) is getting married next month and asked if Charlie could be the ring bearer. She’s always loved him and thought it would be a fun touch for her wedding.

The problem is, Charlie gets really anxious around large groups and doesn’t handle strangers well. When he’s stressed, he sometimes pees out of nervousness. I explained my concerns to my sister and told her I didn’t think it would be a good idea for him to be in the wedding because I didn’t want to stress him out or risk him being uncomfortable.

She got really upset and accused me of lying, saying I’m making excuses to keep Charlie out of her special day. She’s been telling our family that I’m being selfish and unsupportive and that I’m ruining her dream wedding by not letting Charlie participate. Some family members are now siding with her, and I’m feeling torn and guilty.

86,1f7745b,AITA for refusing to sleep in the living room so my parents and siblings can have more space,"I 15m have a younger brother 6m and a younger sister 3f. My parents are not very rich and when I was younger, before my siblings were born, I remember they could barely afford to send me to school and had to apply for many financial assistance programs. Nowadays we’re doing better as my parents have found more stable jobs.

So we’re moving house soon, and now we’ll be moving to a 3 room flat which actually only has 2 bedrooms. My parents are going to take one and I assumed that I would be sharing with my brother because my sister usually sleeps with my parents. And they told me this before I moved.

Then my parents suddenly decided that they needed more space in their room, so my sister wld have to sleep with me and my brother. Which is ok. I don’t mind. THEN, my parents suddenly said that it would be better if I just slept in the living room. Cos the room has no space. They want to just convert the couch to a sofa bed and that’s just my room forever I guess.

But what the hell??? Why do I get the worst end of the deal when my siblings get to enjoy their own room?? I honestly feel like since I’m older then I should get more privacy right?? And it’s not like I don’t help out I pick up both my siblings from kindergarten every day after my own school ends, I deal with all their snack time lunch time whatever.

So I told my parents as such and they said it’s not like my room is gone it’s just that I’ll be sleeping outside. I just feel like that’s not justified and if anything they should just take my sister back to their room. They scolded me and said I am ungrateful and it’s also not my decision since I didn’t pay for the house. 

Ok, I understand to some level. I also acknowledge that they might not be able to afford to get a bigger house.

87,1f76qp3,AITA for not signing up to religion class at school even though my parents wanted me to?,"Hey, first time posting here so excuse me for any mistakes. So, I (15F) has always been raised in a religious family. I come from eastern Europe, so it's not unusual. I just started 10th grade at my local high school, and our home teacher gave us two lists to sign ourselves up for religion and sexual education. My parents (48F, 52M) agreed on letting me not to sign up for that second option, but religion in their mindset is not up for discussion. The thing is nobody signed up for either one, meaning I would be the only person attending religion. I talked with them about it last year, since the situation was almost the same, except for the fact that my best friend attended as well. They refused, both last year and this one. So today, at the first day of school when the teacher handed us the list, I did not sign up for the class. At first, I told my mom that the teacher got fired and they didn't find the substitution yet, but when she got home I told her the truth. She said that I fall victim to the internet propaganda and stuff, and that she and my dad raised me in a catholic family, so I will attend religion wether I like it or not. I told her that it's up to me and I refuse. We went like that back and forth for a few minutes until I went to my room.

So, AITA for standing up to my parents in that manner? 

My dad isn't home yet, and the crapstorm will start again when he does, so I'll update here shortly.

Update: I just wanted to point out; this class is teaching only about my national religion only.

My best friend has always made a point to complain about the time off even when she was given full weekends off because she didn’t feel like working weekends, but weekends are our busiest days and always have been. 
So we’re always left picking up the slack on weekends because she doesn’t want to come in which I don’t mind to much but I have rarely if ever had a weekend off or could get a weekend off because she’s always off and if there isn’t at least one of us in we would have to close the store.

Here’s where I might be the asshole i told my best friend that I was exhausted constantly being the only person to work the weekends and she told me that if I was tired of working weekends i should just use my only paid holiday days to take weekends off and we could close the store those days essentially saying that I should give up my time off so she didn’t have to work, which wouldn’t be a problem if i didn’t always cover her shifts for her when she goes on holidays or to a festival but she has only once covered a shift for me in the 4 years she has worked here. 
My husband is tired of it so he told me to speak to the owner which I did and now the owner has changed the days we close the store and made it so no one can take weekends off unless it’s booked as time off, my best friend is pissed about it because she wants to do things on the weekends and now she feels like she can’t because she has to work.

This was one of the reasons why we became friends and later started dating, we bonded over our familial situations.

Last week we went over to his parents' house because it was his dad's birthday, and they had invited a lot of people from his family.

Before I could even answer she goes on about how if I get too chubby it'll become distracting for everyone around me, especially for my students (I'm an assistant professor).

I was the cashier for the day and dad came to take their order, while mom went to sit down at the benches we have at the door to scroll on her phone. Their daughter, however beelined to the drink station. 

Noticing the daughter about to stick her hands inside the spigot for the iced tea (which is separate from the soda machine) I calmly say (I didn't raise my voice at all, they and another family were in the store) “Excuse me little one, could you please not touch that?""

Mom looked up from her phone, immediately got defensive and yelled at me ""Dont yell at my child! I'm right here, you could have just gotten my attention!""

Now, I get it. Stranger danger and all that, don't want strangers talking to your child. However, I needed to stop her before she actually touched it. Its a health hazard, people get drinks out of that, and I don't know where your daughter's hands have been. Your entire family just came from outside. She could have had peanut butter residue or something on her hands and the next person to drink out of it would have went into anaphylactic shock. And I didn't raise my voice. I used a gentle voice just to get her attention and not contaminate the spigot. 

I apologize to the mom and explain the above, minus the outside part. She however isn't having it, and yells at me again that shes right there and not to speak to her child. Dad is right there at the register, just waiting for this to finish so I can take his order. So i apologize to her again and turn to her husband to take his order. As soon as I turn to her husband, she's back on her phone, now with her daughter sitting next to her, hand around the shoulder.

AITA? Should I have done anything differently? I've already told my boss, and after they left I still disinfected and sanitized the spigot, even though I stopped her before she touched it. I felt like if I did it while she was still there, she would have had another meltdown.


Edit/Update- Thanks for your feedback. While it may seem obvious I wasn't in the wrong, I was doubting myself since this was the first time I've witnessed someone got so defensive over their child doing something wrong. Just the other day, we had a kid climb up on the table after not listening to his mom, but when I gently told him to get down, and did, mom thanked me. So other lady's response kinda surprised me. 

So today is my day off and I just got off the phone with my boss. I'm not in trouble, and she reassured me about that. She called to tell me that the mom came back and tried to complain. This is secondhand from her, so some of it might not be accurate. 

According to her, lady came alone and tried to file a complaint that i ""screamed"" at her child and frightened her. I am so glad the restaurant has cameras with audio, so my boss played back the incident for mom to watch. Boss said she had to max out the volume because she could almost not hear me over the generic music we have playing in the store. 

After the video played, Boss says to lady, ""So, you want me to punish my worker for stopping your kid from messing up all that iced tea? Because if he hadn't, and she successfully did so, I would have made you pay for all the iced tea she ruined."" 

And she would have. My boss is a short middle aged black lady from the south. She knows how to insult people and make it sound like a compliment (don't worry, she doesn't use this power for evil). Not to mention, we had just made that tea, so the container was near full. (Container holds about 5 gallons.) 

Boss said lady got wide eyed and 
backpedaled hard on her stance, told her to thank me on my next shift and left the store. Then called me, since she thought the whole thing was ridiculous. And now looking back on it, I kinda agree. 

I'm gonna enjoy the rest of my day off. Maybe stop by the store and buy my boss something nice. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITA for asking a customer's kid not to touch something?  Throwaway cuz i literally made an account just to ask this.

93,1f744i6,AITA for asking my BF for a second birthday present? ,"For some back ground my (26F) boyfriend Jacob (22M) have been together for 3 years and he’s just got his first job after finishing university. Since I worked full time and he was studying, i funded a lot of our activities, meals ect. I am someone who likes to spoil the important people in my life I.e when Jacob was offered his job I took us out for a meal to celebrate which cost £270. I’ve done this willingly and expect nothing in return. In terms of presents for birthdays/ Christmas we have always set an agreed price limit.  To be clear Jacob doesn’t financially struggle. He lives at home for free, his car, car insurance, phone are all paid for. He has a couple thousand in savings from money gifted by family members and had a couple thousand in his bank from a temporary part time job which he spent going out for the euros and a couple birthday trips with his mates.

Onto the recent event. Jacob’s birthday was in February and I paid for us to have a spa day followed by a meal and also paid for him to do an escape room. All in all, it cost just over £200 (not including the cost for myself at the spa or meal). 

My birthday was in May (3 months ago) and Jacob didn’t have much money at this time. I really wanted a piece of jewellery but hadn’t seen anything I liked so we agreed I would keep looking and he’d buy it at a later date. I recently found a jewellery store I really liked and Jacob just got his first pay check, so we went to get my present. The store had items ranging from £50 to £10,000. The entire time I was conscious not to pick something too expensive. I really liked a necklace at £125 and earrings at £100. Without asking I said he could buy the necklace and I’d get the earrings. He didn’t seem happy, pausing to think and then said, ‘well I guess my ring cost £125’ referring to a previous present I had bought. I was a bit annoyed because you don’t buy to receive… or that’s what I think anyway. At the same time, in the moment I felt bad and really rude for not asking if he was ok with the price first. However after thinking  about it more and all the money I’ve spent throughout the relationship without hesitation and not wanting anything in return, for Jacob to hesitate on this one thing that’s a birthday present I’ve waited 3 months for has really upset me.

95,1f73u9f,AITA for reporting the girl who tried to break my glasses instead of talking it out?,"My school put on an event where local ""celebrities"" performed their talents (music, dance, etc). It was a beginning of school-year morale booster (our year starts really early, so a lot of students get grumpy about it). Students in the theater club would participate, mostly to help out but also to have their own ten seconds of fame. During the show, the participating theater kids were told to choose a friend to give their microphone to so that more students could participate in the performance.

My friend, Ally, is in the theater club and she was instructed to choose someone. She approached me where I was sitting and began outstretching the mic to be, but at the last moment, she turned and gave it to her other friend, Ella.

Maybe it was because I tend to be more reserved and she thought I didn't want to go up there. To an extent, I didn't want to. But at the same time, I would probably never get an opportunity like that again. Or maybe Ally was closer with Ella or maybe Ella had some kind of talent, idk. But Ally did say she would pick me if she got another chance.

The performance section of the event ended and there was an intermission. There would be a vote and one of the students would win. Many of us got up and went into the lobby. While I was standing off to the side, I saw Ella approach me. We're not friends, so it was a bit weird. Then, she pulled my glasses off of my face, threw them on the ground, and kicked them. I was really mad. I had done literally NOTHING to her. I thought for sure they were broken and that had been her goal, but somehow they weren't broken.

I approached the vice principal, who was one of the busy ladies making the show run. Before I could get a couple sentences out, she waved me off to the principal. As soon as I mentioned Ella to the principal, she said ""I don't want to hear it."" She said that everyone wants a turn to go onstage, but they can't make up things to make it so. She looked at the glasses that were on my face and said ""Your glasses are perfectly fine, aren't they?"" The principal was saying that even that if Ella took the glasses off my face, I was making a big deal about nothing and that if someone really wanted to break a pair of glasses, they would have.

In the end, she was not removed from the ballot, but she didn't win either.

I don't know, am I making a big deal out of nothing? Later on, Ally told me that Ella is dealing with some mental health stuff and that I was an asshole for reporting her to the principal instead of just talking to her. Now I'm wondering if Ally's right and I'm an asshole.

Am I the asshole for reporting the girl who tried to break my glasses instead of talking it out?


Update:
I talked to my parents and they got a meeting with my principal. At first she tried to save face and say I hadn’t told her what I had told them (maybe if she had listened she would have heard it all -_-). But when my parents mentioned the superintendent she became more willing to help. The principal apologized and said she was just really busy and many students were complaining about not being in the performance. 

Ultimately, there will be a meeting between the principal and Ella and her parents. I don’t know what they’ll talk about but apparently Ella will be offered emotional support services or something in addition to deciding the consequences.

I’m happy it worked out, but Ally still thinks I should have left it alone. I’m not super close with her either, so I guess I should find some other people to hang around.

96,1f73i84,AITA for being unsympathetic when addressing issues regarding my niece with my SIL?,"To start with SIL is my niece's stepmother. She and my brother have been married for 2 years. He lost his first wife 3 years ago. My niece was 5 at the time her mom died and 8 now. My brother met SIL and married her in 3 months. It was fast. None of us met her before the wedding. Concerns were expressed but he told us he needed to move forward and my niece needed a woman around the house.

There are a lot of problems here. My brother is the cause. But he refuses to hear anybody.

Some of the stuff going on is, SIL is jealous of my late SIL. My niece doesn't really like SIL and is distant with her. My brother (according to SIL) doesn't love SIL and is still in love with late SIL. My brother encourages SIL and my niece to be a mother/daughter duo and he's not listening to his daughter.

To be more specific. SIL is uncomfortable any time my late SIL is mentioned by anyone. My niece asks questions about her mom, we answer. We also try to make sure she's not a taboo topic of conversation. SIL interrupts those conversations when they happen and tries to change the subject. It's worse again if my brother joins in the conversation about late SIL. She has talked about my brother saying late SILs name in his sleep, confessing his love for her, and living out some really deep talks with her all while asleep. Some of the things he says have really upset her. This makes her more sensitive to my niece talking about her mom and it's where my primary concern is. My niece has said SIL doesn't like her mom's photos being in the house or that my niece makes her mom Mother's Day drawings for her grave. She has told my niece to stop mentioning her mom because it hurts her feelings, it's not her home anymore. She also took down some of the photos in the house. My brother replaced them with more. SIL wasn't happy that my niece was happy to see more back.

My niece is distant with SIL and my brother sees it. So he sets up these ""mother/daughter"" dates for them and my niece hates it. So then he tries to talk her into giving SIL a chance. Does it where SIL can hear and then hears them discuss missing late SIL and how my niece doesn't want SIL around.

I brought her out to lunch and told her she needs to stop taking these issues out on my niece. She argued that it's hard to be the one loving and nurturing a child while they worship a dead person. I told her to get over it. Late SIL is her mom and will always be her mom and *SHE* can't change that. I told her kids will love their parents even after they're gone even if they're young. I told her she has issues with my brother, she should address all this with him or leave. But to stop putting all this crap on a grieving little girl.

97,1f73926,"AITAH for insisting my husband use his own bank account, even though we married in community of property?","So I posted about this recently but I deleted the post because I thought the matter was resolved because he agreed to it but now has gone back on it. 

My (35f) husband (56m) has basically not gotten his affairs together (he’s from another country) and so relies on using my bank account as his primary account in my country. 

His argument is that we are married in community of property and I benefit from him using my account considering he earns more than I do and we need my account to pay bills in my country with his money he earns abroad.

My argument is that I too have a business and it’s making taxes more difficult to sort through but also that it’s the only account I can get paid through because this account is linked to my business that I also get paid from abroad with and if my bank just randomly decides to not do business with me because of “irregularities” I am absolutely screwed. Another reason is that he has charges coming off randomly for his business and if I’ve allocated money somewhere and something comes off, it puts us in a financial situation I don’t want to be responsible for where I have to explain to people why I can’t pay them. I’m big on integrity and just DON’T want this happening. If money is more controlled on my end, I can prepare for and mitigate any issues ahead of time instead of being constantly blindsided. This creates a lot of anxiety for me. It’s like wanting to be responsible but then not being able to because I have to think for two people. 

I mentioned this was a boundary and basically he’s saying it can’t exist as a boundary because my money is his and his is mine, that we’re supposed to be partners -I told him I have no problem sharing my money and paying for stuff (which I do) but that the problem was the impracticality of using one account because of all the reasons mentioned. 

He feels as though I’m saying he’s “not good enough” and “inadequate” in some way because I want him to get his affairs in order so he can have a bank account here. 

I feel like I have given him four years to try and sort things out and that if he was never planning on taking care of this he shouldn’t have made empty promises. 

He says that he’s taken care of everything else and has “given me and my family a quality of life we didn’t have before” and that “the perks” of being married to him should be enough to let this notion of having a boundary on my bank account go. I said that goes beyond the scope of the argument and that it feels emotionally abusive to be bringing up “how much he’s done” and holding it over my head to justify why I can’t have this boundary. 

AITAH? Where is the line drawn between having personal boundaries and being a partner/wife married in community of property? 

I may be TAH because this is a hard boundary for me but I’m also married to him which means I have some obligations. 

EDIT: People are wondering why I don’t just open another account with the same bank -I can, but my money from PP will still go straight to the primary account (to my knowledge) which takes a few days to come in and by then his expenses might have gone off already, for one. 

For those saying I’m not taking responsibility, this is actually me taking responsibility by insisting on my boundaries but for a moment I questioned myself when he brought up the community of property thing. For context, I’m in therapy for crippling anxiety and people pleasing behaviors because of CPTSD childhood trauma and while I’m not trying to paint myself as the victim, it’s necessary that I give the context that I’ve only recently been able to stand up for myself and asserting my boundaries and not be codependent anymore and trying to turn my life around. 

For those worrying about tax season: I spoke to my accountant who said that if we can just sort through this current mess and what happened over the last two years that things will be ok, but I need to make the changes now, which is what I’m doing. Please don’t scare me, I’m already pretty nervous about all of it 😅

Also to those wondering, this boundary is not going to change -this is something I NEED done, but I wanted outside perspective in case I wasn’t seeing the full picture. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITAH for insisting my husband use his own bank account, even though we married in community of property? So I posted about this recently but I deleted the post because I thought the matter was resolved because he agreed to it but now has gone back on it. 

My (35f) husband (56m) has basically not gotten his affairs together (he’s from another country) and so relies on using my bank account as his primary account in my country. 

His argument is that we are married in community of property and I benefit from him using my account considering he earns more than I do and we need my account to pay bills in my country with his money he earns abroad.

My argument is that I too have a business and it’s making taxes more difficult to sort through but also that it’s the only account I can get paid through because this account is linked to my business that I also get paid from abroad with and if my bank just randomly decides to not do business with me because of “irregularities” I am absolutely screwed. Another reason is that he has charges coming off randomly for his business and if I’ve allocated money somewhere and something comes off, it puts us in a financial situation I don’t want to be responsible for where I have to explain to people why I can’t pay them. I’m big on integrity and just DON’T want this happening. If money is more controlled on my end, I can prepare for and mitigate any issues ahead of time instead of being constantly blindsided.

98,1f73583,AITA for telling off my (20F) boyfriend (20M) for not calling me?,"
I’ve been with my boyfriend for 8 months now. I’m someone who needs to call and text when we’re apart because I miss him a lot and feel isolated and almost like I’m not dating him if we don’t have contact for a while. I don’t ask for a lot, just a few texts throughout the day when he’s available (I never get upset about waiting for hours for a text) and one call at night before we sleep. This wasn’t an explicit boundary that I set at the beginning of our relationship or anything; it more so happened naturally but hasn’t been happening lately.

Two weeks ago, I had gotten my wisdom teeth out and although I know it’s not a huge surgery, I wasn’t able to go out for around five days because of the pain and swelling, so I felt very lonely as I’m someone who feeds off of social energy. In this time, he barely called me because he was busy with work then hanging out with his friends. He even promised to call me one night but he didn’t and the next day, I asked why he didn’t call and he said he was so tired he passed out right when he got home. I was annoyed at this but wasn’t very upset as it can happen. Then the day after that, he was out until around midnight then when I called him when he got home, he said he was talking to his mom and to give him five minutes. I told him it was okay and not to rush, and he ended up calling me an HOUR later which made me upset, as I had been waiting all day at home for his call and I felt that it was common sense not to take THAT much more time.

Then this long weekend, he left on Friday for a tournament in another city and barely texted/called me. When he did, it was very brief. I texted him a paragraph on why this recurring pattern was upsetting me, in a very calm tone. I told him I wasn’t looking to argue or be mad at him, I just wanted him to know how I was feeling. He told me he understood and that he’d put in the effort.

He’s back in town tomorrow, and although vague, we had made plans. He called me briefly during the day, but not at night so I called him tonight and he said that he wanted to see me and that he missed me very much but he felt that he had to cancel because he hadn’t been spending much time with his family and his parents had recently brought up to him that they felt they never see him anymore. Tomorrow is also the last day before school starts for him and so I understood why he would want to prioritize his family, but at the same time I start my internship the day after and it’s a full time job, which means we would see each other less. 

Am I being unreasonable to be upset by this? I feel like if he did love me and wanted to talk to me as much as he says he does, then he would make the time to. Or is this just an unfortunate series of events and I’m being the AH for getting upset over something natural, like schedules changing and him being less available?

99,1f72qbq,AITA for not being open to the idea of changing my first name like my foster parents suggested?,"I'm (16m) a foster kid. I was taken from my mom 3 years ago because she's not doing good mentally and it wasn't considered safe for me to live with her. My current foster parents are the ones I hope to stay with until I turn 18. They're the best I've had and I bounced around a lot, especially in my first year. But there's something that has come up and now I'm wondering.

So my name's Ryder. My foster parents don't outright say they hate it. But I think I saw my foster mom cringe at my name before. My foster dad asked me when we first met what my middle name was and I guess that wasn't a name they liked either. So they call me Ry and I think sometimes they tried to say my name's Ryan instead of Ryder.

A month ago they had asked me if I had ever considered changing my first name when I turn 18 to something more sophisticated sounding. They even said Ryan could be an idea since it's so close and they share a nickname. I told them I liked my names and didn't ever think of changing them. They didn't say any more then but a week later they told me they had thought a lot about my future and they worried my name would be something that holds me back. My foster mom said it sounds so lewd when said fast and they felt I deserved better than that. I told them it didn't bother me and I liked that my mom had chosen my name. That was the end of it again. And then last week they brought it up again and they showed me these articles on the importance of a name, of naming babies for adult life instead of being cute or fun as kids. They told me they couldn't make me do it, which I knew, but they would like me to strongly consider it so I could have the chance at a professional future and being taken seriously. They said they would hate to see me passed over for jobs because of my name. And that they feel like a much older me won't find the name as cool as I do now. They asked if I trusted them and I said yeah and they said if I do, I should really give some thought to what I could change my name to that would be a better name for adult me.

I told them I was really never going to be okay with that. I felt like it was a waste of time and would get me stuck with some name I wouldn't like. They asked why I was so okay with dismissing future me and why could I not try, when they were doing all they could to help me. I could tell it really got to them that I was still so against it.

100,1f72ftg,AITA for not being sympathetic when my friend’s partner bailed on them. ,"For some background information; my friends and I (we are 4 people total, Tina (the friend in question) Tina’s partner, George (my other friend) and me) were going on a cabin trip together for a weekend. George’s partner was coming to town from overseas so we were going to bring them along. It had been planned for months, everyone was aware of it and had cleared their schedules (supposedly. They were supposed to clear it MONTHS ago!). The cabin we were staying at was already booked, I’d done all the work to ensure we were all set. About 2 weeks before Tina’s partner, not even bothering to tell me himself, apparently figured out he had to work that weekend. He’s a bit of a workaholic so it was expected and I mostly know him through Tina anyway. But thing is; when that happens it’s almost always a 50/50 chance of Tina bailing aswell. And surprise, a week later, same excuse Tina drops out aswell causing George to say “let’s see about the weather” (“I’m not going now either”). This is the 3rd time these friends have pulled the same thing. So now since I booked the cabin through family (luckily, there’s no deposit); I now have to go through the humiliating process of retracting my booking and explaining what wonderful friends I have.

To today; Tina comes to us (George and I) complaining about how her partner had asked for them to go on a day trip and hang out, inconvenienced her by having Tina clear her schedule of other commitments and then he’d told her the day before that he had to work. She made him out to be an asshole and asked us if we thought she was in the wrong for being upset with him, asking for our sympathy and support in her situation. I didn’t, this is where I might be the AH. I honestly I didn’t feel bad for her. I may have responded coolly and unfeeling towards her. I honestly think it’s a bit of comeuppance from the universe.

My uncle, her father lives nearby. He had a nice home in another state but when he was on a trip overseas, she and her mother sold the house and bought a very small, crappy one bedroom condo that’s situated in the hood. That’s what he discovered when he arrived home (his house sold, his new home). (FYI discrepancies in house value between states, not in their favor). She then used both of then to become nannies for her kids so she didn’t have to pay for childcare.

There was a small family reunion. I accompanied my mother as she has early set dementia. So me cousin invited us to dinner with her kids under the idea it was a “family get together.” Of course she didn’t invite my sister’s surviving kids and father. Aren’t they part of “family.” Then she had her dad pick up all the food and prepare it after his dialysis where he drives himself. Aunt is immobile.

Honestly I don’t know if I’m in the right in this situation so that’s why I’m here. I grew up in a very religious household with strict religious parents, personally I’m not religious myself but I go to mass every now and then. Every year my parents would make me go to a church school very far away taking an hour to get there and 1 to get back because of traffic. We also spend an additional 2 hours at the church school doing various things and chores. My parents would always say it’s their duty and all which I respect but I am always dragged along. I am starting high school strong with 3 honors classes and 4 clubs I’m attending, on top of that I’m doing tennis. You can guess I’m going to be quite busy staying up till 4 AM trying to catch up on work. Last year was pretty tough as I had to work into the late hours of the night to even finish things before the morning of the next day. And by no means am I a slacker, many of my peers have said otherwise and complemented as such. But I digress, I know with this many extracurriculars and honors classes I won’t be getting any sleep especially during the weekends as things are now due at weird times such as Sunday 5:00 Pm or Saturday 11:59Pm. A few weeks back I thought my mother would understand this and not enroll me into the church school for this year. Quite the opposite though as she yelled at me about making a vow to make her children go to church school till their 2nd year of high school. I know that the church is quite far away from home and I won’t be able to do work there as I have “god’s work” to do. This is a major time commitment and I know I will have to sacrifice sleep on a school night no less. I’m already stressed out by deadlines at the start of school heaven forbid finals week. I voiced these concerns in a calm manner yet she still refused to listen. I’m fine with going to the church school and all I just don’t know if I can commit to that or if I even have time to squeeze those 4 hours in. Today I was confronted and given an ultimatum out of nowhere. I’m at a loss for words at this point as things have stopped to a new low. My mother said that if I head to church school they will accept my BF (14 M). I honestly don’t know how to respond to this situation without sounding rude or irritated. I reiterated that that is a different problem which isn’t relevant to the current ongoing problem. She then yelled at me again about her vow before bringing up making me talk to my dad.

104,1f71zh1,AITA for calling my wife out for inserting herself into my brother's marriage?,"Some background, my wife and SIL are cousins, so they have been very close to each other prior to meeting us.

My brother had planned to attend a live concert with his wife for quite some time. IIRC, he bought the tickets a year in advance. Throughout the whole week before the concert, he would keep telling me how much fun they had at the previous concert they attended and how he was looking forward to the next one.

On the day of the concert, my wife and I were visiting my parents when my brother and wife arrived to drop their kids off at my parent's house. My wife and my SIL started to talk about the concert and how fun it was going to be when my wife asked if we could tag along. I immediately told my wife that I could not go due to some work-related tasks, but she insisted and said she could go by herself, which I was ok with.

So they looked for the available tickets and there were none in their section. So she started to ask if any VIP tickets were available, which there were. At that point, my SIL started to berate my brother because he didn't buy VIP tickets for them. Because of this my brother got upset and said he could try to sell their tickets and purchase a VIP ticket so that she could go with my wife; however, the tickets he purchased were not transferable. After my brother and SIL argued my brother said that he didn't want to go anymore and that my wife could take his place.

At that point, I privately told my wife not to go because she would be inserting herself into their relationship. But she ignored my suggestion, bought my brother's ticket, and went to the concert with my SIL. When she arrived back home, I called her out for inserting herself into my brother's marriage but she insisted she had done nothing wrong, and before we knew it we were arguing about this matter. Soon after my wife called my SIL and they concluded they had done nothing wrong as my brother didn't want to go after they had argued.

A few days later, I spoke with my brother and he said he had a bunch of problems with his wife before the concert, but that the events that occurred during the concert made everything worse (i.e. his wife preferred to attend the concert with her cousin and not him). The next day I relayed this information to my wife, I explained that she did nothing wrong until she accepted the ticket and took my brother's spot. I explained that none of the issues my brother and sister-in-law were going through were her fault, but she made a mistake by attending the concert.

105,1f71xay,WIBTA if I sold rare merch I reserved for someone to somebody else?,"I(25F) run a small Discord server for a niche ship in a formerly popular fandom. Our English-speaking community is tiny, all merchandise for our ship comes from Japan, requiring a proxy service to purchase.   
In March, a fanartist for our ship participated in a Japan-only doujinshi event and later put the items for sale online, which again required a proxy service.  
  
I mentioned in the server that I was planning to buy multiple items from the artist's shop. Two members, H (18F) and K (21M), asked if I could order for them too, as they didn't know how to order from Japan. I agreed since it would help lower international shipping costs by splitting them among the three of us. Neither H nor K paid upfront; I told them to wait until the items arrived at the proxy warehouse to avoid extra transaction fees on paypal.  
  
By mid-June, all the items reached the proxy, so I messaged both H and K with their totals (excluding the cost of shipping from Canada to the USA). H paid within a few days, but K messaged two days later, saying he needed more time to pay.   
  
Fast-forward to August 9th, K asked if it was too late to pay, and I told him it wasn't since the package hadn't arrived at my house yet. After that, he ghosted me again.

I received the package on August 26th and messaged K, updating his total to include domestic shipping. He replied, claiming he had already sent the payment and offered to provide proof if needed. Confused, I checked my PayPal and found no payment from him. I even searched my PayPal using his wife's email (which I had from a previous transaction in November) but found nothing recent.

I asked K for the date he supposedly sent the payment, but he took several hours to respond, despite being online and playing a game. Eventually, he said he'd double-check when he got home and asked me to send the new total, but I was left wondering why it was taking him so long to check his or his wife's PayPal history.

While this could be an honest mistake, the lack of communication from K since June, when he was supposed to pay for the items+shipping, has been frustrating. A friend in the same server, who also loves this ship, mentioned she'd be interested in purchasing the items K ordered since she regrets not getting them when she had the chance.

Now, I'm tempted to sell the items to my friend just to be done with this situation. But I feel guilty since K won't ever be able to get this merch if I do (since its so niche). On the other hand, I've been waiting for nearly $50 CAD for months with no communication from K. Technically, the items are still mine since K hasn't paid anything yet, but I did purchase them with him in mind.

My boyfriend (30M) and I (26F) are going to Las Vegas with his cousins in a few weeks and today we were trying to figure out schedules and what we are going to do while on this three day trip. It turns out that his cousins really want to see a boxing match that will be happening at the same time as one of my favorite DJs. My boyfriend and I really don’t care for sports at all and I personally would really prefer to go out to see my favorite DJ. So while on this topic I remembered that I have been trying to meet up with my best friends (26M & 25F) who I haven’t seen for over two years since they moved to Las Vegas. I told my boyfriend that one option could be that I could go out to this event with my best friends while the rest of the groups stays back to watch the fight and once the fight is over they could catch up to us, to which my boyfriend had a very negative reaction. He stated that it looks wrong to others that I “abandon” him. I responded by saying that I wouldn’t be “abandoning” him but that I would be doing something that I enjoy while he does something he enjoys by hanging out with his cousins, watching the fight and eventually catching up to us a few hours later at the event. I also mentioned that it would be healthy in our relationship for us to not always be attached at the hip. Long story short, the conversation ended with him hanging up on me because I told him that if I was out with my cousins and he wanted to hang out with his friends (aka flipping the script and putting myself in his shoes) that I would not mind at all if he left with his friends because at the end of the day I want both of us to be happy and I want both of us to do things we truly enjoy and I truly believe that it is healthy for us to not be attached at the hip 24/7… Anyways, am I the asshole for not wanting to stay behind to watch the fight and instead wanting to go out with some old close friends of mine?

Well, here's where the ""lying to me"" part comes in: he and his kids did nothing in the back yard; they attacked the living room and discarded things without even asking if me or my sister still wanted them, including our old Total Gym (which I was about to list for sale), a practically new roasting pan with rack, a decorative trug (wooden basket) full of pine cones, several cups, pans, a Pyrex bowl, measuring cups, an entertainment unit FULL of VHS tapes (and probably stole the tapes), an antique mirrored shadow box for displaying knick knacks and an antique mirror.  The last two items once belonged to our maternal grandmother.

I found the roasting pan, minus the rack, the trug and the remains of the entertainment center, but nothing else, so I'm left wondering if some of our things didn't wind up in the back of his SUV.

Will I be the asshole for verbally ripping him a new one for lying to me and throwing away my things without even bothering to ask me or my sister if we still wanted them?

EDIT: **My sister and I are currently still living in the house.  We have a ""move out by"" date of November 26th, the day before Thanksgiving, and are getting no money from the sale.  We will be homeless on Thanksgiving Day.**  I am considering asking him replace the shadow box since he threw it away without asking if we still wanted it.",Asshole,2024-09-02,"WIBTA for yelling at the fix & flipper for lying to me and throwing my things in the trash?

113,1f6z7am,AITA For not returning a pet to their owner who lives 1000+ miles away?,"I went to a friend’s for dinner and found a friendly cat outside his apartment. I decided that if the cat was still there after dinner, I would take him home for a bit - since I wanted to see what having a cat would be like.

After 2 hours, he was still there. I noticed he was neutered so I look him to urgent care to see if he had a microchip.

The cat is a 6 month old male American shorthair They found a microchip, called the owners and left them my contact info via voicemail. They noticed the owner’s address was in **Virginia**. I am in **Arkansas** (1000+ miles away) That night, I bought some cat stuff and let him stay at my place.

The next morning, the owner called me and told me:

* Cat was stolen 2 months ago, along with all the cat stuff she had for him
* She lives in Virginia
* “The crazy thing is, this is the third time I lost a pet”. (the cat was the 3rd pet that got stolen from her)
* **“I don’t care how long it takes, I just want my cat back”**

I told her I’d figure smth out, this is what our conversation was word for word:

Me: “How do you wanna get the cat back”

Her: “I have no idea ur a 4 hr flight away”

Me: “If you fly over to <airport>, I can meet you at the airport and hand him over. I don’t think I should be the one to fly over”

Her: ""I don't have any money to fly anywhere. My cat was stolen n takin over state away I don't know how imma b able to do that""

Me: ""I'm willing to foster it until you have the funds to fly over""

Her: “I guess I’m just never going to get my cat back it’s whatever”

— 2 days later

Me: “I’m going to take care of him until Sept 14

If you still cannot afford to fly over, I’m going to leave him at a shelter and will send you their contact”

(EDIT: - There’s great shelters around my area that would be much better for the cat than my apartment. My idea was to hold on to him to give the owner time to make a decision. If she doesn’t want him back, then I’ll keep him.)

Her : “At this point it’s whatever yall can have him I don’t have the money to just get on the plane And it don’t look like nobody’s going to give me my cat back So imma just let the police handle” — end of convo

TLDR: I am taking care of a lost cat, but the owner cannot afford to fly over. I don’t think I should be going out of my way to return the cat. Her story seems suspicious to me.

EDIT:
I admit that it’s dumb for me to bring a cat home “just because”. I’ve always wanted to have a cat/dog so I just yoinked him without much thought, gonna figure things out as I go.
But I obviously didn’t want to steal a cat that has an owner so I went to urgent care to check or a microchip. 

The cat was following me around and wouldn’t leave me alone, and my friend who lives in the building has never seen the cat before

- no collar: if he was an outdoor cat, wouldn’t the owner put a collar on him or smth?
- untrimmed claws: if he was an indoor cat, wouldn’t the claws be trimmed?

114,1f6z10t,AITA for taking home olive oil and Parmesan cheese from a restaurant?,"Earlier tonight, I (26F) and some friends went to Maggiano’s Little Italy for dinner. My friend (40F) next to me kept joking about taking home the olive oil and Parmesan home because it’s so good. I told her she can just pour them in to-go containers and take them home - leaving the original bottles at the restaurant obviously. 

She only took a little bit. I told her they won’t charge us since it’s complimentary (friend is on a tight budget financially). So I poured the entire bottle of olive oil and Parmesan container into her to-go container doing her a favor. 

Our server saw me and just gave me a warning that the oil and cheese have no preservatives so we have to consume them very soon before they go bad. I said ok, thank you for the warning. Other than that, the server didn’t mind or no employee complained or said anything to us about taking the oil and Parmesan home. 

My other friends at the table thought we were rude and had no manners. I feel like it would be rude if was NOT allowed or I packed it after the restaurant telling me no. Neither situation happened. Friends think I’m an asshole for that. I don’t think so. 

Obviously I know olive oil and Parmesan cheese exists in store, Maggiano’s version just tastes superb compared to grocery store items. Obviously if there was an olive oil or Parmesan take home fee, I would pay it for my friend if it existed. 

I personally think Maggiano’s has plenty of olive oil and Parmesan cheese since they’re usually always busy and have tons of tables/events. I did not take their entire supply, just one table’s worth of olive oil and Parmesan cheese. 

Only thing I would do differently is to ask the server beforehand so I wouldn’t hear my friends complaining about it. Even asking, pretty sure server would’ve said yes and allow me to take it. Please let me know what you guys think! AITAH for packing olive oil and Parmesan cheese home for my friend?

115,1f6yya8,AITA for being pissed because bf won't use AC or open windows,"My partner (32M) and I (29F) recently moved into a new apartment, which has central air. I like to have cooler air while I sleep, and if it were only me, would probably keep the AC at around 70-73 during the summer; my boyfriend likes warmer weather and would likely rarely use the AC, if ever, if it weren't for me. So we've compromised at 77 at night and about 79 during the day. 

Our latest electrical bill came in at $78 -- about twice our last bill, which only covered the 2-ish weeks we'd been living here already. My BF freaked out and immediately blamed me for using the air conditioning at all, saying we need to turn it off and use it less. 

**The catch: he also refuses to open the windows**, because he is concerned about air pollution from the highway, which is nearby. I would be more sympathetic to this if it weren't for the fact that we both agreed to move into this apartment, in large part because it had the amenities he was hoping for (in-unit washer/dryer, dishwasher, etc). No one was forced to live here. It was not our only option.

119,1f6yc5x,AITAH for not understanding my buddy's GF moving in with her ex?,"So about 2 months ago a good friend of mine (21M) we'll call him Grayson, started dating this girl (23F) let's call her Tay. 

Grayson has had a rough go of it over the last 5 years. He struggles a lot with anxiety and depression, self care, keeping jobs, etc. As a result of some of that, he hasn't received a lot of female attention yet in life. 

This spring he started talking to Tay and they became close, and recently became official. He was absolutely overjoyed, and made it clear to all of his friends that this relationship is what makes life worth living for him right now. He's also said he'll do anything to not lose her. 

A lot of his friends have noticed he's basically living and breathing only this girl. We were all a bit concerned and mentioned that infatuation can cause you to overlook red flags, etc.

The first red flag came just after they started dating. I noticed that on her Facebook she still had all of the photos of her and her ex up. Her main banner photo is a picture of them together. Grayson had photos up celebrating his new girlfriend Tay, and she still months later hasn't posted anything about Grayson. He's also mentioned to me that Tay's ex was abusive. 

Weird but ok. Then it got weirder.

Yesterday, my buddy Grayson tells me that Tay is actually moving back in with her ex. She spent the summer in the city Grayson lives in, and now she's going back to uni in her city for this fall, where she has an apartment on campus (the lease is in her name) 
She apparently told Grayson her ex is moving out in a few weeks, but in the meantime she has nowhere else to stay. I asked if she knows anyone or has any family that could give her a place to stay so she doesn't have to MOVE IN WITH HER ABUSIVE EX BECAUSE ARE U SERIOUS BRO? He said she doesn't. One of my buddies told Grayson she could stay with his girlfriend who lives in this city. He said she probably wouldn't go for it because ""she doesnt know your GF well"". 

I tore into him a little and basically explained how I couldn't believe he was OK with this for multiple reasons, and that there had to be a better option. He tells me, ""he's obviously not happy about it, but he trusts her and doesn't see any real problem."" I tried telling him that it seems like he's getting the wool pulled over his eyes here, and I'm worried he's going to get burned in the end. He didn't seem to be concerned at all. He felt I was being rude for suggesting that, and accused me of not trusting women.

After talking to him I spoke with my friends, they all think Tay's behavior is super sus and unacceptable for someone in a committed relationship. And I completely agree! I just don't feel right about any of this, it feels like my friend is getting played, and he just seems oblivious to it all.

Grayson had photos up celebrating his new girlfriend Tay, and she still months later hasn't posted anything about Grayson. He's also mentioned to me that Tay's ex was abusive. 

Weird but ok. Then it got weirder.

Yesterday, my buddy Grayson tells me that Tay is actually moving back in with her ex. She spent the summer in the city Grayson lives in, and now she's going back to uni in her city for this fall, where she has an apartment on campus (the lease is in her name) 
She apparently told Grayson her ex is moving out in a few weeks, but in the meantime she has nowhere else to stay. I asked if she knows anyone or has any family that could give her a place to stay so she doesn't have to MOVE IN WITH HER ABUSIVE EX BECAUSE ARE U SERIOUS BRO? He said she doesn't. One of my buddies told Grayson she could stay with his girlfriend who lives in this city. He said she probably wouldn't go for it because ""she doesnt know your GF well"". 

I tore into him a little and basically explained how I couldn't believe he was OK with this for multiple reasons, and that there had to be a better option. He tells me, ""he's obviously not happy about it, but he trusts her and doesn't see any real problem."" I tried telling him that it seems like he's getting the wool pulled over his eyes here, and I'm worried he's going to get burned in the end. He didn't seem to be concerned at all. He felt I was being rude for suggesting that, and accused me of not trusting women.

After talking to him I spoke with my friends, they all think Tay's behavior is super sus and unacceptable for someone in a committed relationship. And I completely agree! I just don't feel right about any of this, it feels like my friend is getting played, and he just seems oblivious to it all. First she leaves all her photos of her and her ex up online, and doesn't post anything about Grayson after they go official? And now this? Red flags all over imo.",0.0,0.9593786597251892,1,0

121,1f6x2b1,AITA for telling my Dad about my Step Brother?,"My (27F) dad (58M) and my step mom (56F) got married earlier this year. She has two sons, James (25M) and Carter (23M). The only son I was familiar with was Carter whereas I had only met James twice before the day of the wedding.

At the wedding, James pursued me like no man ever has before. We instantly connected. When we went to the bar later, he was very forward with me and i fell for it. From that point on, we talked non-stop for 2 months. Within 2 weeks he talked about wanting to buy a house for us, how many kids he wants and what he would expect me to do as a wife basically. Over the next 2 months, these are some things that were said by James: telling me he'd put me on his benefits, what we'd name our daughter if we had one, wanting to ""create a life together"", calling me his ""special girl"", talking about how he wants me to carry his children, telling me ""he's low key waiting for me to tell him I love him"". He'd send me a lot of stuff on Instagram about children, couples, sweet words, etc.

It all went south when I went to stay with him while he was working. He'd just gotten back from a 2 week trip to Thailand as well and had gotten me a necklace. As soon as I got there though, he was off. The first 2 days were ok but it got worse the longer I was there. He would barely acknowledge me when he got home. On the morning I was leaving, he told me that he ""thinks I should leave the necklace here so I dont get the wrong idea about this"". He left for work. I headed home. I texted him later that night, and it was a big paragraph which i regret now, but i was so shocked and confused. I really cared about him and just wanted to know what he was feeling so we could talk about it.

But he ghosted me. I felt so awful. I live with my dad and one night he saw me crying. He asked me what was wrong and I thought 'fuck it, what the fuck do i have to lose?"" and told him what's being going on. My dad didn't say much. He actually went to Carter and asked him if he knew what was going on between us. Carter would tell James this, and he ended up calling me. He asked me if i'd told my Dad to get a reaction out of him to which i said no, I was genuinely heartbroken and couldn't hold in how upset i was anymore.

For context, we all went to high school together and in our junior year we all had our own drama that affected our whole social circle. I’ll be honest, when it all happened we all left E out of our  “friend group” and it made her feel really crappy but we’re all grown up now.

Since high school (we graduated 2020), I’ve always been known to hang out with E and N SEPARATELY. There was only once where N invited E to a party where we were all together. In that time, E has had some things to say about N’s lifestyle as she is a christian blogger and E has had some religious trauma. E doesn’t appreciate how different N is from her social personality as a christian blogger. 

Before the wedding, N reached out to E for an address for the save the date and explained how she still calls her one of her closest friends where E decided to tell me that she never considered her a close friend ever. I kept that info in as it wasn’t that serious and seemed to be something that E would say anyway. 

As we got closer to the wedding, E would tell me how she would talk to one of her own friends, G, about N specifically and would judge her posts on social media. She specifically said that G would send the posts to her and they would criticize it. One time I decided to check and G doesn’t follow her, so G goes out of their way to search up N and send the post over. At this point, I told N and she decided she would not send an invitation to E. 

About a month before the wedding, E realized she wasn’t getting an invitation and also realized she couldn’t go as she would be on a family trip out of state. One day E decided to say “should I just say f*** it and fly back for the wedding and be all judgey in the corner?” 

It was that one that made me even more upset, but I didn’t tell her that, I just said “well, would it be worth it?”

I told N about that conversation and then N decided to block her on social media. 

Fast forward to a couple days after the wedding: E texted me saying “bro I think N blocked me.” 

I sat with it and decided to tell her the truth: That I told N and that what she decided to do was no longer invite her and block her or her own security.

123,1f6wpl7,AITA for complaining about my partner spending a lot of time with her family? ,"My partner (27F) and I (25F) have been together for 5 years.
Last year, she quit her job because of an issue she had at work that affected her mental health. At the time I had just started working full time. I was in a good state financially to help her out. I wanted her to recover mentally.

Before moving in together, we agreed to responsibilities of rent and chores. She planned to do food delivery to help me out. She tried it, but did not do well and applied to jobs but did not hear back. She then got a job that wasn't high paying, but could help her bills. She never went in for it. She didn’t want to do that job, even though she had bills. She does not believe much in traditional jobs 9-5s, she wants to have her own business. 

I paid for rent, her bills, mine, gas, groceries, food expenses for her family, and lent money for other misc. things for about a year. I kept track of her bill expenses as we had agreed she would pay back.

In June, she made up with her family and started spending a lot more time with them.
I didn’t mind her spending time with them because she made up after a fight a couple months ago, but it feels like she left me here with the responsibilities that we agreed to do together. She visits her family daily now. It’s been a couple months now since they’ve made up. She also goes to take care of the dogs. 

I had to quit paying her bills back in July because of my masters program coming up. 
I am left with low savings now.  It feels like she’s not committed to this relationship anymore and is prioritizing her family instead of helping herself and her partner. While I work full time and take care of chores she is with them instead of getting herself back up. She isn’t a student since she dropped her class earlier this year. 
When she is here, she cooks for us and cleans every now and then.
I’ve always worked for my things growing up. I studied and worked to have the job that I have now. I didn’t have it easy as I come from a low income family. She is doing a side job that her mom helped her with but still isn’t much to cover her bills let alone help me.

She’s told me she would rather be poor than to work a traditional 9-5 in the office or at fast food jobs. I don’t see motivation from her and I’ve tried to talk to her about it but see no change. She leaves to her family even after talking to her about it. She’s already compared herself with me. This has brought issues when we have arguments always saying I have it good and she doesn’t, when I worked for my things and she’s not done much about her situation. I have helped her.

Idk what to do. We live in a small studio, so I understand she needs her space, but her going there daily (spending the nights/going and coming back at night to me) is starting to feel like she’s just a roommate. 

AITA for wanting her to spend more time with me and commit to this relationship of 5 years? I miss the time we had together. It feels like it’s me, her, and her family in this relationship, not us.

My husband (52) and myself (50) have been married for 31 years. We purchased his parents farm several years ago and paid for it with a mortgage. We have since paid that mortgage off. We also built our forever home on the farm and it is also paid for and we raise cattle on the farm. 
His family is always asking for help. His sisters specifically and a couple of his nephews. For context, we took care of his father, mother, and Down’s syndrome sister when nobody else in his family would take care of them. We were the only ones of his siblings who still had young children at home but we felt that if we didn’t take care of them the state was going to step in and take them away. In my family you take care of your family so we took them in and never looked back. 
However I think his family resented us for this and somehow feels like they are owed something because we own the family farm. And for some reason my husband thinks he has to take care of his other sisters even though there is nothing wrong with them except they have low IQs. 

I have inherited a decent amount of money from my parents. My husband doesn’t know the specifics and is upset that I won’t disclose the amount. He doesn’t have access to the account. He wants me to take some of the money and build a house on our farm (his family farm) for his sisters to live in so they won’t have to pay rent anymore or live in apartments. He wants us to pay their property taxes and insurance because “they won’t be able to afford that” but they can pay their utilities. He doesn’t want to charge them rent.

127,1f6weko,AITA for telling my dad I feel disrespected when he prays for me to become Christian again?,"So I (31M) am atheist. I grew up southern Baptist but never found comfort or community in the church. When I was around 16 I started asking questions to the pastor and his answers tended to feel like cop outs and ultimately led to “just have faith”. It didn’t make sense to me so I left and mostly consider myself atheist. I do occasionally do some meditation and pagan-adjacent rituals to help ground myself and feel a sense of control when I know things are beyond my control. I know I’m not manipulating the world with magic but it helps give me a sense of control when life gets too chaotic. Praying is the same thing. 

Growing up my dad never went to church  but after I graduated college and he got sober, he dived deep into religion. I’m happy for him and happy it’s helped his sobriety but he can be a bit much sometimes. He knows I’m atheist and while he claims to accept it, he has vocalized that he wishes for me to come back to the church and restore my relationship with god. To clarify, he’s totally cool with me being gay it’s just being atheist that bothers him. 

Last weekend I was visiting my dad and I was telling him about this guy I was dating (by the way I’m gay. Surprise!) and how even though we have a difference of faith we respect each other. My boyfriend is Christian and was raised catholic. My dad asked what I meant by that and I explained how we wouldn’t belittle each other about what we believe nor try to convert each other. I mentioned how I had stipulated that while I don’t mind him praying for my wellbeing and positive outcomes, I don’t want him to pray for me to become Christian or anything of the like. My boyfriend agreed and we are good on that front. 

My dad then proceeded to tell me that every night when he prays that he prays I find the light and become Christian again. I told my dad that this feel disrespectful to me and while I can’t change how he prays I don’t like that he prays I convert. This made my dad angry. He accused me of disrespecting him by telling him how he can and can’t pray and that he just wants me to be happy. I asked him, “happy as what?” That made him more mad. He yelled that I had no right to control his prays and I should be grateful he prays for me to be happy. I told him I am happy being atheist and I don’t want to change that. He screamed that he didn’t want me to change but to just start believing in god again. I yelled back that doing that is changing. 

He got pissed and told me to get out. So I left and went home. Now he’s blowing up my phone and saying I’m an asshole for not resolving this like adults, I don’t think adults solve problems like this but AITA?

EDIT: I told my BF to not pray I be saved. I told my dad that I felt disrespected he prays I’m saved. I had told my dad he can do what he wants. The prayer stipulation is for my BF not my dad.

129,1f6wb7p,WIBTA For telling my wrestling coach that I can’t dedicate everyday to wrestling?,"So I 16f am part of my high schools wrestling team, and I’d like to think I’m pretty committed to it. The problem is I’ve had a lot of things coming up lately and one of my wrestling coaches seems to think I’m supposed to dedicate every waking minute to wresting/practice. She herself is a pretty accomplished wrestler, and I respect the journey she’s taken to get to that point. But the problem is she thinks that we’re supposed to spend every second of our day practicing. 

A few weeks ago my cat died, and she had called me the day after to give her condolences. And then that same day told me and sister we had to practice the next day. On Thursday was my mother’s birthday, but we celebrated on Saturday. We had already informed my coach we wouldn’t be showing up to practice on Saturday, and she went on a rant talking about how she sacrificed many important events in her life to practice. I don’t want to live that way. I love wrestling, I’ve found something that I like. But I have a life outside of it, and I don’t want to miss things because of it.

We normally practice 4 times a week, sometimes we practice 6 days a week. And she hates when any of us miss practice. Recently I couldn’t make it because of an eye doctor’s appointment, I texted her saying I couldn’t make. And she went to our group chat and said “shoutout to __ for never missing a practice”. All because me and my sister couldn’t make it. But because school is starting up here in the Bronx on Thursday everyone is busy. She’s even asked me and my other teammates if we’d be able to take time out of our school day to practice, and has gotten upset because we said we didn’t want to do that. 

I want to tell her that I can’t dedicate every single day to wrestling, because I, like the rest of my teammates have lives outside of it. But I’m scared that it’ll come off as rude or disrespectful, and that I’m not committed to wrestling.

130,1f6w9nj,AITA for telling off someone else's kids?,"I (27f) and my husband (34m) have a 1yo son, he is only just 1. I try and find nice places to go out with our son and today's location was a little beach/river with a picnic area and playground. When we arrived it was very full of families with kids playing in the water. 

I took my son into the calmest side of the park to go in the water, also right infront of the lifeguards. 
Near us was also a group of kids all playing together. They ranged from around 6-13. No parents in sight. Not a big deal. I had my son with me in the shallows. These kids start getting pretty rough with each other and go from throwing sand at each other,  to fighting with fists. 

Over the next half hour we continue to move further from these kids who seem to gravitate towards us. 
We take my son out of the water and are playing in the sand for a little when they older of these kids starts unclipping the younger floaties and trying to hold him under water. 

This obviously causes a fight between these kids and it moves right next to us. They are fighting and kicking and almost hit my son with their kicks. Again NO ADULTS around. 
I tell them ""If you hit my baby you'll be in some serious trouble"" 

The oldest girl who looks around 13 or 14 starts going off saying I'm not allowed to talk to them. So I say I'm telling them not to hit my baby. She keeps yelling then runs out of the park, behind some trees and comes back with her parents. Both of whom are carrying beers, clearly having been drinking. 

They say that I yelled at their daughter, which I didn't do but anyway. My husband tells them their kids are fighting and almost hitting our baby. They then tell us only the girl is theirs and the other kids are ""their autistic cousins"" I'm like that's fine but they can't go almost hitting a baby because they are fighting. They keep going off at us, I even tell the girl ""I'm sorry you felt like I yelled at you. I didn't yell, but I'm sorry you thought that."" And they keep going off. Our stance doesn't change from don't have their kids almost hit ours. Their stance is we aren't allowed to talk to their kids and should have talked to the parents (who weren't in the park).

We kind of say whatever it's done, grab our stuff and start to leave, they keep going off and this 13 year old starts making obscene gestures while they all yell.

They go off, run and grab their cousins who follow us out of the park, and up the road calling me a ""stupid white bitch"" and saying I was only doing this because they are brown. 

This wasn't my reasoning. And my husband is also Hispanic and even though he was there they only took issue with me, but again I was the one to tell the kids they'd be in trouble. 

Maybe I shouldn't have told off another person's kid, but we moved away from these kids so many times and they still almost hit my 1 year old repeatedly.

132,1f6vv39,AITA for Kicking Out My Roommate's Twin Sister After She Took Over My Room?,"So I (29M), a second-generation Indo-Canadian, recently moved to the US for work. Things were going great until I ended up in a house with these two ethnically Polish twins from the UK, Kasia and Nadia (both 27F). Kasia’s in med school, and Nadia just passed the bar and is practicing law. Both of them are smart, driven, and, yeah, they’re pretty attractive—not that it matters, but they do love their yoga pants. Just setting the scene here.

Anyway, Kasia was my original roommate. We met through a mutual friend, and it seemed like a perfect setup. We split the rent 50/50, and I took the larger bedroom because I work from home at times and needed the space. Everything was peachy until Nadia, the twin from hell, decided to move in after she broke up with her boyfriend. Without even asking me, mind you!

Suddenly, Nadia was crashing on our couch every night. She was loud, always on the phone, and had a knack for using my stuff without asking. And let me tell you, nothing prepares you for finding your 8 AM Zoom meeting shirt on your roommate’s sister while she’s doing yoga in the living room.

But here’s where things got heated: Kasia had to go on a two-week clinical rotation in another city, and she told Nadia she could take over her room. Fine, whatever, that was between them. But then, Nadia decided that my room was ""better for her mental health"" or some nonsense because of the ""natural light"" and ""feng shui."" So she started moving her stuff into MY room while I was at work.

When I got home and saw this, I nearly lost it. My bed, my desk, my PS5—all of it was shoved into the smaller bedroom, and Nadia had turned my room into her own little law office/yoga studio combo. Kasia, from wherever she was doing her rotation, thought this was all just “a big misunderstanding” and that we could “sort it out when she got back.”

So, in my infinite wisdom (or maybe stupidity, you decide), I told Nadia she had 24 hours to get out. When she didn’t budge, I started moving her stuff back into the living room. She flipped out, threatening to sue me for “unlawful eviction,” which I’m pretty sure isn’t a thing when you’re not even on the lease.

The next morning, she was gone—along with Kasia’s expensive espresso machine, my favorite hoodie, and all the toilet paper in the house. Kasia is furious at me for ""mishandling the situation"" and says I’ve caused a rift between them. Nadia, now back at her ex's place, is telling everyone I’m an a-hole who ""discriminates against Eastern Europeans""

133,1f6vfnj,AITA for not letting my neighbor pet my puppy?,"I have a 6 month old golden mix puppy. He's incredibly sweet and loves dogs and people, but he's often difficult on the leash. He gets distracted easily and sometimes just won't walk. He is in training classes and doing well, but he's still a baby and is learning.

For context, I live in an apartment building. There are often people around the outside of the building walking or taking their dogs out. I took him out tonight to potty before bed and he was being particularly difficult. I could tell he had to poop by the way he was acting, but he also wouldn't move.

He spotted a man and his lab coming towards us.  My puppy was alternating between not walking and pulling me on the leash. I'm getting tired and frustrated. The man comes up to us and asks if lab can say hi.. I said “I'm sorry but no, he's in training and being a little difficult today"". Man says okay and walks away.

I finally get my pup to start heading back towards the main doors but really want him to poop before going in. I see man and his lab standing in front of the main door. Dogs are locking eyes and he's letting his lab come near us. I sort of pull my puppy in another direction and get him to go towards the area he usually poops. Man and his lab walk by us anyway. My pup is freaking the hell out be he wants to play with the lab but it's almost 10pm and I know he needs to just poop and go to bed. I'm thinking dude can't you see I'm struggling please walk away with your well trained adult lab, but instead he comes closer with the lab. My dog starts freaking out so I say ""I'm sorry, I just really need him to go to the bathroom and he's very easily distracted"". Man reaches out his hand to pet my dog, and I said ""I'm sorry, he's in training I don’t want him to get distracted with people touching him""... man goes to pet him again and says ""how old?"" And I said ""6 months"" and he says ""oh just a baby!"". At this point my dog is freaking out with excitement and I'm just pissed at this point and I pull him closer and say “I really don't want anyone touching him right now."" Man scoffs and walks away. Of course my dog poops immediately afterwards lol.

So awkward be he must live in my building. I feel uncomfortable bc I think I was rude but also don't know why he wasn't taking no for an answer. I'm also pregnant and very moody so just feel bad.

Man reaches out his hand to pet my dog, and I said ""I'm sorry, he's in training I don’t want him to get distracted with people touching him""... man goes to pet him again and says ""how old?"" And I said ""6 months"" and he says ""oh just a baby!"". At this point my dog is freaking out with excitement and I'm just pissed at this point and I pull him closer and say “I really don't want anyone touching him right now."" Man scoffs and walks away. Of course my dog poops immediately afterwards lol.

So awkward be he must live in my building. I feel uncomfortable bc I think I was rude but also don't know why he wasn't taking no for an answer. I'm also pregnant and very moody so just feel bad.

TL;DR Neighbor repeatedly approached me and my puppy after I said no he couldn’t.  ",0.0,0.0394517518579959,0,1
134,1f6vf22,AITA? Constant critic on the football pitch ,"My wife and I, who are beginners, joined a pickup soccer game with some friends and were split onto opposite teams. When they asked us to play we let them know we weren’t very good. From kickoff , One player on my team was very critical, yelling and making negative comments, gestures and eye rolls about every mistake. The last straw for me was when My wife asked him a simple question about where they changed the lines to, and he responded by yelling at her, telling her to pay attention. (They were not even on the Same team, wife was playing on the other team)

I tried to acknowledge my mistakes the first couple times he tried to correct me and stay positive, but his behavior made the game uncomfortable. (Ie apologizing / raising my hand up as acknowledgement when he would tell me to pass there instead of here, dribbling incorrectly etc) After enduring his constant criticism, i ended up telling him to “shut the fuck up bro and worry about yourself” after his last comment about some place I should’ve run to but I didn’t. He then had a little more to say after my initial comment so I said “I’m not playing bro” before deciding to leave the game.

AITA for reacting this way, or should I have handled it differently? Apparently a couple of the people on his team (others shared our sentiment and gave us looks everytime that happened) talked smack about us so I’m wondering if we were in the wrong?

I just had not known that it was going to be this weekend that he decided to get tattooed. He texted me just as I entered the parking lot for Disneyland and told me that he made a cardinal sin and did not sleep, did not eat, did not drink any water, and went for a 2 mile long run right before he sat down to get tattooed. 

I scolded him and asked if he was ok. He told me he had fainted as she was tattooing him. I was shocked and worried for him. But he reassured me that he was ok and it laughed off.

139,1f6uegc,AITA for telling my son that the girl he likes has a boyfriend?,"My son Caleb is 17 and just started his junior year of high school. He's autistic and has successfully re-integrated back into the general ed student body after being in special ed since he was in elementary school. We're very proud of him as despite his challenges, he's a smart kid.

He's known Kelsey (16F) since his freshman year (she’s also a junior). She's a very nice and very pretty girl, and Caleb has always referred to Kelsey as his girlfriend. While I know Kelsey enjoys hanging out with Caleb, I can tell that she doesn't feel the same way about him.

Shortly after the school year began, Kelsey confided in me that she has a boyfriend whom she began dating earlier this summer. He's a classmate of Caleb's and they get along okay, but at the same time they're not friends who hang out together outside of school. Kelsey has told me that she doesn't know how to tell Caleb that she has a boyfriend because she still wants to be his friend, but she worries that things might be awkward between Caleb and her boyfriend. But she also worries that Caleb will be very hurt once she tells him. I told her that I'd talk to him. She said that she wanted to be the one to tell him, but I felt like it would be better if I were the one to tell him.

So the other day I sat Caleb down and explained that I knew he liked Kelsey, but she doesn't think of him as anything more than a friend, that she had a boyfriend and said who he was, and that he was making both of them uncomfortable and needed to respect their boundaries. Caleb didn't react well to this at all. The next day Caleb told me that he and Kelsey had a big argument because Kelsey never told him that she had a boyfriend, and that he didn't know he was making them uncomfortable and wished she would have told him. Caleb is mad at her for lying to him. I explained that she wasn't lying but she wasn't sure how to tell him.

Later that day, Kelsey called me and berated me, saying that I had no right to tell Caleb because she was planning to, and that she never said anything about Caleb making them uncomfortable or violating their boundaries, because he wasn't. But she told me that I was violating her boundaries by telling Caleb something that wasn't my place to tell him, and that I had gotten a lot of details incorrect.

Now, Caleb is mad at Kelsey and not talking to her. Kelsey is telling me that the whole thing was a misunderstanding and that she still wants to be his friend, and meanwhile her boyfriend doesn’t even understand why Caleb is so upset. Her parents are also angry at me and say that I ruined what was once a very nice friendship.

I will admit that I did tell Caleb that Kelsey felt uncomfortable and that he needed to respect her boundaries, but I felt like it was the only way to make Caleb understand that he could not continue calling Kelsey his girlfriend.

141,1f6u4is,AITA for telling my best friend his mom isn’t coming back no matter how religious he pretends to be? ,"My BFF is the best and we are best friends for life, even if he's different right now.

He was never very religious and actually called himself an agnostic until his mom left his family. She said she left because she needed to be closer to her church and religion and because their family isn't religious enough. She's living with her parents and they said she prays 24/7 almost. She is clearly having mental health struggles and I'm sure she'll come back eventually.

But since she was left, my best friend is now the most religious person on the planet. He is constantly praying and constantly at church, etc.

I told him I was hooking up with a girl and he said it was a ""sin"" and he's ""worried about me."" It's honestly hard to believe how much he's changed in the past year.

To mess with him I would joke that I was going to kiss a guy or explore my gay side. I'd ask if he had a problem with that and he'd say ""no, of course not, that would be homophobic."" I'd mess with him and say, ""But isn't it a sin?"" And he just isn't sure what to say to that. But it is nice he hasn't fallen into gay-hating religious BS.

But he is being a hypocrite. He's always been the type of guy that girls like, and there was a girl that he had feelings for, but she kept pressuring him to sleep with her. And it eventually happened. He was upset at first, and said it wouldn't happen again, but they have now done it like... 10 times. But he's now saying he can't see her anymore, pre-marital sex is a sin, and she won't see me if without sex being on the table so it's over. And he blocked her because she keeps trying to change his mind.

But yeah, it's 2024. I don't know anyone religious like that. She's not gonna give up sex until marriage?? I keep trying to convince him to talk to her and that she misses him, but he doesn't want to listen. It's just been exhausting.

When we hangout, he won't drink, won't do drugs when he use to do that stuff. Last night he disappeared and went for a walk in the neighborhood at midnight while at my house with our friends. We were freaked out because we weren't sure where he was. We found him on a walk ""praying."" He had been praying for hours. Outside my house. At midnight.

She has mental health struggles and is disguising it with ""my kids aren't religious enough, I hate them"" but it's her having a mental breakdown. I told him he needs to stop with the religious shit.

We were in a motel room with 1 queen size bed for my husband and I, one pull out bed for my brother, and a crib for our son. The lay out of the room meant the crib is in the corner and the pull out bed is in between the crib and our bed. My husband and brother went down to the casino and came back rather late that night, but did a great job of being quiet and didn't disrupt my son or me, as we were fast asleep. My husband and brother go to bed once back, and after about an hour my brother begins to start snoring. And I mean crazy loud. To the point it was drowning out our sound machine and had woke my husband and I up. Our son was beginning to wake up, as with each loud exhale he began moving and eyes opening. 

By husband and panicked and didn't know what to do. We let it continue for a couple hours but it was clear from the monitor (we had the baby cam up too) our son was not liking it, but, still not fully awake. My husband asked if he should wake my brother up, and ask him to switch beds with me, and sleep with him in the queen bed, to be farther from our son. As again, the pull out is right next to the crib and in between the crib and queen. I said I would wake him, he is my brother, and I did so. 

My brother is very kind and shy and immediately agreed to switch but was mortified this was happening. Him and I switched beds and then he went into the bathroom for a longer than normal period of time. I noticed as i was concerned I hurt his feelings and sure enough, he was crying in the bathroom and said he would sleep in the bathroom. We have a great relationship and I was able to quickly convince him to just come to share the bed with my husband. And he did. In the morning we all talked about it and he seemed a little embarrassed but ok with the situation. I didn't notice anything off and we spent the whole day together after. 

When we got home and put my son to bed, my husband and I chatted about the weekend and he was convinced we were assholes to my brother in this situation. I thought under the circumstances, we did the best we could as. If my son woke up, we were all in for hell for the night. And it was a bed upgrade for my brother, I got the stiff and uncomfortable pull out. But since my brother is a sensitive lad, I worry I was an asshole. 

Thoughts?

Edit: my brother was only staying in our room as he was a last minute addition and there were no more available rooms.

143,1f6tw4o,AITA for ending a walk with my friend after she made sarcastic comments?,"My friend (31F) and I (30F) have been close since childhood, and a few years ago, we ended up moving into the same apartment complex. At first, it was a lot of fun, but lately, I've noticed that she relies on me a lot, especially for dealing with her anxiety. I’ve tried to be supportive, but it's starting to feel overwhelming.

My friend often self-medicates with alcohol due to her anxiety, and the activities she enjoys usually involve drinking. I’ve been trying to encourage her to try healthier things. We tried an art class and a salsa class together—she said she liked the art class, but didn’t seem genuinely interested, and she quit the salsa class halfway through because she found it too hard. That was fine with me; it’s more about trying new things together.

Recently, I invited her on my daily walks around the neighborhood, hoping it might be a healthy activity we could do together. When I suggested it, she gave me a weird look, like it was a strange thing to do. But she agreed, so we headed out. The route isn’t anything special but there are some cool hills and views. However, during the walk she started dragging her feet, mumbling sarcastic comments like, “Yeahhh sooo beautiful” and “Yeah this is lame” when we reached the hills.

At that point, I got frustrated and said, “Alright, well if you’re going to be in a mood and not enjoy it, then why are we here?” I turned back and walked to our apartment complex, making sure she got back to her place before I returned to the hills to finish my walk.

In hindsight, I realize I might have reacted too quickly and should have thought it through more. I texted her afterward, explaining that I just want to find healthier activities for us to do instead of drinking, but she accused me of gaslighting her by assuming she was in a bad mood. Now, I’m really rethinking the friendship and the energy I’ve put in but I’m scared of making a decision I’ll regret.

144,1f6th30,WIBTA For Demanding My Roommate Pay More For Living Costs When They're Going Negative,"I (19M) and my roommate (20F) have moved in together after we met off of VRChat back in February of this year and, for the most part, it's been amazing. We're both away from our families that we don't like very much, we have our own freedom, and just everything is going great.

Obviously I wouldn't make this post if there wasn't a ""but."" For the past 3 months she has been getting very irritable and part of that has to do with paying rent. So far I've taken out about $700 of my own savings because she couldn't give me the money by the time I pay rent for the both of us. According to her, she has had a shitty experience with paying rent as she doesn't have a car and so she has to go with whoever it is to go to the bank and back and it puts a ton of pressure on her. On top of that, her job hasn't been giving her the hours she has been wanting and has been going negative.

I confronted her and learned that she is was going negative about a month ago because I asked if she would mind paying what I'm needing now. She said she has about $50-100 she could give me after rent was paid as electric and internet are separate from rent (Last month was about $250).

Now I don't mind picking up a bit when she can't but picking up 3 months in a row is running me down now. Although, I learned why she is going negative and no, it's not because of her hours. She is paying for GamePass, DashPass, Spotify premium, etc. and simply refuses to give them up. As well as ordering through doordash for about half the month after paying groceries at almost $300 per grocery run.

This leaves me in a particular spot as I get paid less than she does by $3/hour and I can't keep making up for my part of rent, groceries, and hobbies because of her when she could simply cut down on her spending (I have offered to drive her places as she doesn't have a car for groceries etc.).

145,1f6t7hv,AITA for not giving my little sister unlimited use of the car while on vacation ,"I (24f) have a 4 year old daughter, Ava. I was a bridesmaid in my best friend’s wedding but the only kids invited were hers. It was 6 hours from our house and my husband is deployed so I asked my sister (18) if she would mind coming with us, babysitting for the first night and second day, then she could either stay with us for the next 3 days (we turned it into a little vacation) or I would take her to the train station and buy her a ticket to go home. She agreed to help and wanted to stay. 

The cabin I rented only had parking for one car so I told her we were taking my husband’s car and that she could use it but she had to ask first and be mindful of how long she had the car since this area is not walkable at all. I told her she was always welcome to join us on our outings and if she wanted to go somewhere when we might need the car I’d gladly drop her off and pick her up. 

On the third day she told, not asked, me that she’d be taking the car all day so she could have a spa day, do some shopping, and go out to eat in the bigger town a half hour away. I asked how long she plans to be gone and she shrugged her shoulders. I told her I could drop her off and pick her up but she can’t take the car all day. She threw a bit of a temper tantrum and said she needed the car so she could put her bags in the car and not have to carry them all day. I reminded her that I said she had to be mindful over the usage of the car and leaving us stranded in the cabin all day is too much. She called me a controlling bitch and refused to leave her room while Ava and I were home. After I got Ava down for a nap she told me that she needed me to buy her a ticket and drop her off at the train station now. I told her to wait for Ava to wake up and found a ticket that could work with her wake up time but apparently that wasn’t good enough and she had to be away from me at that second so she decided to wake Ava up so she could leave. 

I was sick of her bullshit so I dropped her off at the station with the ticket for a train that would leave in 3 hours. She had the nerve to ask for payment for babysitting before I left. 

My mom called after we got back to call me a bad sister for not letting my sister use the car, not buying an earlier train ticket, and not paying her for babysitting. I think I was being fair but some of my friends think I could’ve at least given her $50 so AITA?

The day had gone great so far, and from what I knew everything was going according to plan, I got home, and she's behind schedule getting ready- this is not something that happens for her ever, and I was surprised, but the reason wasn't her fault, and it was barely a twenty minute deviation. However, I was just waiting by the door during that time and the dog decided he needed out, so I took him for a walk around our yard, it took maybe five minutes, and I cleaned everything up and had him put up before my wife was ready, we made it to the dinner reservation by the skin of our teeth, and that was that.

We had a great date, and I would have never known she was upset with me until the next morning, when she said that she had ""never known me to be so impatient.""

I constantly do this with with my family and I haven't gotten a single person that reacted negatively, even with my sisters, dad AND mom.

Our relatives looked at me weird and I figured something was up but i couldn't make out what. My mom said ""come and grab it yourself"", which was literally a first because in our family if someone is standing you can ask for something, if everyone is sitting down, it's okay to ask the youngest, which is me.

My mom came up to me yesterday and told me that it was very rude for me to ask salt, and that I was acting spoiled. I do, in fact come from a well-off family, (not billionaire rich ofc, just around the american dream.) but I wouldn't consider myself spoiled.

148,1f7lpo1,AITA for having a ‘no more coffee mug rule’ in my home?,"Am I the asshole for having a ‘no more coffee mug rule’ in my house? 

For background, my husband and I have owned our house for about 4 years. We rent out two of the bedrooms, one to a friend and one to my cousin. Overall, they’re great roommates and we rarely have an issue. 

It’s also important to note that I was recently diagnosed with OCD, so I’m well aware I can be a bit much sometimes, especially when it comes to the housekeeping. I am the main one who takes care of the deep cleaning of the kitchen. My husband will, on occasion, help with sweeping and mopping. 

The issue is that my husband and cousin like to accumulate mugs (travel mugs and regular coffee mugs). In general it’s not a problem, but with 4 people living in a home, kitchen space is limited. There came a time when my husband and cousin’s mugs were spilling over into areas of the kitchen meant for other things (plates, Tupperware, etc.) Out of frustration, I initiated a rule that they would not be allowed to bring a new mug into the house to be stored in common areas, unless they got rid of an old one. In general, it’s been fine and they understand my reasoning for the rule.

Maybe I’m just having an off day, but today my husband and cousin were joking that I was going to start throwing out all of the mugs because my cousin had purchased another one. I usually have a good sense of humor about things, but today, it got to me. I started to wonder if I was being an asshole for limiting the number of things they can have if it’s something that brings them joy.

149,1f7lnlt,AITA for accidentally throwing away some of my roommate’s things?,"Three years ago, I (29M) moved into an apartment with my niece (20F) and one of the things we originally argued about was who does what chores. 

One of the things we agreed on was that we’d alternate taking out the trash but after a while she would whine that the walk to the dumpster was too far and she was tired of putting garbage in her car to drive it over there. I thought she was being over dramatic but I just told her that I would take out the trash every time because I didn’t feel that was worth getting into an argument over. She said she would just put the trash bags by the front door for me to grab on my way to work. 

The other day when I was getting ready to leave, I saw two black garbage bags in the usual spot by the door so I grabbed them and threw them in the dumpster. 

I got home the next day and my niece was livid. She said that she was going to take her bedspread, sheets, pillow cases and her $150 heated blanket to her mom’s to wash them later this week so she put them in trash bags for easier transport. She said that since she had put electrical tape on the bags, I would know not to throw it away. I didn’t notice the tape but (in my defense) she put black electrical tape on a black garbage bag. 

I told her that this was her fault. She could’ve put a note on the bags, texted me and told me not to throw them out, or she could have put them somewhere else but she didn’t do any of those. 

She said she called her mom (my sister) and she had spare sheets, bedspread and pillowcases but she’ll have to buy her a new heating blanket. She found the exact same one online for $100. I offered to give my niece $50 and let her use my heating blanket that my dad bought me but I never used. When I made the offer, I said that I shouldn’t have to pay anything because this is not my fault. My sister told her to tell me that the money wasn’t the issue; the lack of respect for my niece and her belongings was the issue. 

AITA? Should I even try to give her money?

UPDATE 

I went to my mom’s house today and my sister was there. I blew up and went to leave. They stopped me and asked me what was going on. 

I started yelling and getting emotional. After I calmed down, I told my sister that I didn’t like that she was mad at me. She told me that she didn’t say anything that my niece had told me. She said that her response was along the lines of “Oh well. That sucks because I just bought it but I’m not buying you another one. If you want it back, you better get in that dumpster and get it.” 

Everything is good now. I’m not going to give my niece any money. She put more laundry in bags but put them in the OTHER far corner of the room so I know not to mess with it. It seems she has learned her lesson in that regard. 

I appreciate all the comments. I was really beating myself up over this because I never wanted to throw away her things. Accident or not, I still felt that I was somehow at fault. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-02,"AITA for accidentally throwing away some of my roommate’s things? Three years ago, I (29M) moved into an apartment with my niece (20F) and one of the things we originally argued about was who does what chores. 

One of the things we agreed on was that we’d alternate taking out the trash but after a while she would whine that the walk to the dumpster was too far and she was tired of putting garbage in her car to drive it over there. I thought she was being over dramatic but I just told her that I would take out the trash every time because I didn’t feel that was worth getting into an argument over. She said she would just put the trash bags by the front door for me to grab on my way to work. 

The other day when I was getting ready to leave, I saw two black garbage bags in the usual spot by the door so I grabbed them and threw them in the dumpster. 

I got home the next day and my niece was livid. She said that she was going to take her bedspread, sheets, pillow cases and her $150 heated blanket to her mom’s to wash them later this week so she put them in trash bags for easier transport. She said that since she had put electrical tape on the bags, I would know not to throw it away. I didn’t notice the tape but (in my defense) she put black electrical tape on a black garbage bag. 

I told her that this was her fault. She could’ve put a note on the bags, texted me and told me not to throw them out, or she could have put them somewhere else but she didn’t do any of those. 

She said she called her mom (my sister) and she had spare sheets, bedspread and pillowcases but she’ll have to buy her a new heating blanket. She found the exact same one online for $100. I offered to give my niece $50 and let her use my heating blanket that my dad bought me but I never used. When I made the offer, I said that I shouldn’t have to pay anything because this is not my fault. My sister told her to tell me that the money wasn’t the issue; the lack of respect for my niece and her belongings was the issue. 

AITA? Should I even try to give her money?

UPDATE 

I went to my mom’s house today and my sister was there. I blew up and went to leave. They stopped me and asked me what was going on.
