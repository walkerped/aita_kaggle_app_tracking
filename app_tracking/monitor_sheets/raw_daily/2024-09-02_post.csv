0,1f7bn25,AITA for deadnaming my friend?,"I (F38) have been friends with Jane (F38, AMAB) since we were 5. We never had secrets from each other, loved hanging out together, and have a lot of memories we share. I remember when we innocently played dress up with two big suitcases of clothes my granny used to wear and let us play with, before any real questions even started. In our late teens I was the first one Jane confessed to when she thought she might be gay and the first one she confessed to not really feeling like a man when we were in our twenties. Both times she asked for my secrecy until she was ready to come out. I was her sounding board when she was trying out new names before settling on Jane – she is a fan of L. M. Montgomery and the bit from Jane of the Lantern Hill where Jane is finally called by the name she likes really resonated with her. She asked me to call her Jane in private, I have been doing that for years now. 

Last year, Jane finally decided to come out to her family and take steps towards transitioning. I was happy for her but I didn’t account for how difficult it would be when it came to memories from before. Until then, when I called her Jane we were in the present. Now that she wanted to stop using the old name, I was still thinking of her past self as he/him. This was my friend who was the first person I thought of when someone told me girls and boys could never be friends. The friend for whom I couldn’t get a matching t-shirt because the ones I liked were only in women’s sizes. There were entire memories with Jane very much male-presenting called the other name. There were books and cards I got from her inscribed with the old name that was still very familiar. 

Last week I was talking over the phone with a family member and mentioned that \[place\] was the place where \[a few friends and Jane’s old name\] went when we were in our twenties. Jane heard me and I could see she was hurt. I apologised and explained that I was still getting used to talking about her with others that way and that when I recall things from the past it’s often like \[Jane’s old name\] is a previous version of her, the caterpillar to her current butterfly and that I don’t see her as \[old name\] now. She was upset and told me I of all people had enough time to get used to her being Jane, that many of our friends that don’t know her half as long managed to get used to it and that I didn’t even update my phone contacts with her current name. That part is true but she knows that I NEVER update my contacts - it’s enough that I can identify the number (all my school friends have their maiden names there, half of the oldest contacts cut off because that’s what transferring numbers via SIM card was like, our old classmate is under the nickname ‘Cap’ he had when we were 15, I have ‘Alex the Gnome’ for a DnD friend from 2004) Jane said she needs to think about it and left. She has not responded my texts or calls since. AITA for not switching to using her name completely?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-09-02,"AITA for deadnaming my friend?

1,1f713zu,AITA for asking if I can wear a suit to my brother’s wedding since I hate dresses?,"   So for context, I’m a 17 year old girl. I have an undercut and dyed hair all the time. I’m fruity and I hate dresses or skirts. 
   Today, after coming home from work, my family (my mom, my brother Ted, his fiancé Lila, and me) started talking about my brother and his fiancé’s wedding. They are getting married in May 2025. 
   I’m just listening to the whole conversation while eating my dinner after work. I then hear my mom ask the question “what kind of dresses are you thinking for the bridesmaids? Are they all gonna be identical or are you thinking just the same color and they can pick their styles?” 
   Don’t get me wrong, if they were to come out and say to my face, “I’d prefer it if you wore a dress” I totally would, but I’ve always hated them. They’re either fridge shaped grandma dresses or slutty stripper dresses. No dress has ever flattered my body and personality. During my sophomore year homecoming dance, I wore a button down with a corset and dress pants. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not fully masculine, but I prefer not to be super “girly girl” if that makes sense. It’s not who I am (no I’m not trans I just prefer to be more masculine presenting in my clothing). 
   I chimed in after Lila said that she wasn’t sure about the dressed yet and I asked if there was any way I could possibly not wear a dress (I’m one of the bridesmaids) and maybe instead wear a suit of sorts or a tux? Lilac looked over at my brother Ted and then both seemed fine with it. No obvious disgust or dislike for the idea. 
   I then see my mom in the background shaking her head and mouthing to “stop it”. Lila and Ted both said it shouldn’t be an issue and they actually have “dresses” that are pants instead of skirts but still flow enough to pass as a dress if I would prefer that since it’s not a skirt and I wouldn’t have to be uncomfortable all night. 
   I just explained how I felt. That I really hate the more girly look of dresses and have no interest in wearing any frilly fluffy thing if I have the choice. 
   My mom just kept motioning to shut up like I was doing something wrong. Lila said that she would definitely see about it, but didn’t seem bothered at all. My brother just kind of lost interest in the conversation while playing with his fur baby so I’m sure they’ll talk more about it later, but I just feel like it’s now my fault for ruining their “perfect wedding plans” all because of my preference in the clothing I wear. It would be one thing I think if I wore dresses but just didn’t wanna wear what she picked, but I genuinely hate dresses with a passion. The only two I own are used as “laundry day clothes”.

2,1f6wd86,UPDATE: AITA For Not Offering To Care For My Unwell Ex-Husband?,"Throwaway Account

I forgot about the password to this account and my step-daughter showed me what to do and once I accessed this I saw that I got a few messages from people asking for an update so I thought I'd share.

First, a few people seemed to be confused so let me be clear, I am a woman who is married to another woman. My own parents passed away years ago so their opinion is irrelevant. My wife and I both have children from previous relationships but we didn't meet until after our children were adults so my wife and I are the only ones who have lived together. Now on to what almost everyone else cares about the most.

I went on cruise! It was great and my wife and I had a really great time. My children were predictably unhappy and I'm sure that my temporary blocking of them didn't make it better. Most of my children kept calling and telling me that I was a selfish and awful woman for choosing to go on the vacation instead of being there for the family, but (like many have you have stated) I reminded them that their father divorced me and therefore my obligations to him ended. If it were any of them that had a medical need I would cancel without question but I would not for their father.

I thought I could leave it at that but because they kept calling and texting the first three days of the trip and that's when I decided to block. Unfortunately, my ex's health took a turn for the worse and he had to go back to the hospital and his lack of proper care triggered an investigation. I didn't know any of this until I unblocked my kids the day I got back and some of them blamed me.

I've come to the conclusion that they're all just mad at the situation and I'm a convenient villain. I've accepted this because I can understand the fear and anger of facing the idea of losing a parent that you love. I just hope that one day we can all sit down with a family therapist and mediate the situation.

However, this did start to trigger my past tendencies of sacrificing my own happiness and well being for my children, but my wife, therapist, and even a small piece of my inner self had to remind me that my children are adults and that my ex isn't my responsibility. I tried to reach out and so far most of my children aren't talking to me and have made it very clear that I will not be able to see my grandchildren as a punishment.

It's sad, and I'm still wrestling with the guilt and doubt, but my wife and stepchildren are being very supportive, while my other family is a mix and most of my friends are neutral.",UPDATE,2024-09-02,"UPDATE: AITA For Not Offering To Care For My Unwell Ex-Husband? Throwaway Account
