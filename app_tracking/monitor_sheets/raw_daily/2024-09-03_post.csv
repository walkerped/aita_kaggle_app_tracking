0,1f7s3j7,WIBTA if I gave my bf an ultimatum?,"FINAL EDIT.: Please stop being up the cats in this post. It’s not about the cats, there’s no problem with them at all, it’s a matter of the other things mentioned in this post. It’s not a SMALL house or apartment. It’s a large house with tons of space. I know it’s a lot of cats but I rescue animals and his family is okay with that. I’m tired of having to respond to comments about the cats. His family was happy to have them and doesn’t see a problem with it so neither should anyone else.

I (19 trans ftm) moved out of my parents house about a year ago and have moved 4 times since them. My most recent move was in with my boyfriend (20 m), his parents have allowed me to bring almost all my pets, had to give two of the kittens up for adoption. They were adopted together and are in their forever home. But I still have the other 5 cats and my puppy. 

My boyfriend’s room was a complete MESS when I first moved in, I talked to him about cleaning it up and he still hasn’t. He’s constantly agreeing to clean something when I ask to, and constantly saying the mess is getting to him too but he doesn’t do anything about it. I literally have nowhere else to go but I can’t keep living in FILTH. He won’t even clean out the cat litter box. He said he wanted to help take care of the cats but I haven’t seen him do one damn thing for them unless I ask. 

He straight up told me one day that “I don’t do anything unless I’m asked to.” That’s a HUGE problem for me. He won’t even take out the trash if it’s full! He said he’d clean out the closet so I have space for my stuff but he HASN’T. So my stuff STILL ISNT EVEN IN THE ROOM. I haven’t even been able to put all of my clothes in the room (I don’t even have very many because of how often I’ve had to move this past year) I love his family, and I love him but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.

EDIT: I was more than willing to give my animals up for adoption, his parents said it was okay and even happily brought them in and absolutely love my animals, even help take care of them just because they want to. I never asked them to. And my bf OFFERED to help with the animals. Even before the animals were there he wouldn’t pick up his room to help me move my stuff in. I should have specified that, that’s my bad.

Extra edit: I should also specify 3 of the kittens were in the process of finding homes for. These are animals I rescued before I had moved in with him, so I’ll only have 2 cats and a dog when we find homes for the other kittens. His family is helping find homes for them. Another thing I should’ve specified.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-09-03,"WIBTA if I gave my bf an ultimatum? FINAL EDIT.: Please stop being up the cats in this post.

1,1f7pamx,AITA for refusing to let my family hang a pride flag?,"I (17 M) am queer. I’ve been out to my family for a while now and despite some problems, they have always been supportive. While my parents aren’t entirely sure where the line between supportive and overbearing is—or sometimes how to listen to queer people on queer issues—they do a good job. 

Where I live in canada, there has been more and more anti-LGBTQ presence. I won’t go into detail, but this year our pride event was fenced and had security. As well, our pride prom was entirely cancelled due to concern for attendees. Completely to my support, my parents had signs on our yard to the sentiment of ‘Protect Trans Kids’ and ‘Trans care saves lives’, etc etc. They were recently stolen and or vandalized by people that were not caught on our camera.

My mom got her back up about this, wanting to double down and be more aggressive with the support. She wanted to put a pride flag up. Of course, she wanted to put it up outside, on our porch/lawn. She mentioned it around me and I shut it down pretty quickly. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable hanging my flag so much as in a window, so I didn’t want her putting it out in our lawn. I explain how discouraging it feels to have someone take that down or vandalize it. How unsafe that can make me and other people feel. Especially since it’s on my property, cleaning denoting me as the queer person. 

She snapped back quickly, saying that I didn’t get to tell her what not to do and how it’s not about me etc etc. She said she *needs* people to see that she’s supporting queer people. I told her that wouldn’t make me feel supported, especially not if it was taken or vandalized. We went back and forth in conversation where I felt I was being put to the side and that my comfort didn’t matter. In the end, I told her that she was being performative with her support if she refused to listen to me and my comfort on this.

To ensure she didn’t take my flag against my wishes as she said she was going to, I gave them away to a friend for safe keeping. She is now refusing to talk to me until I get them back.
