0,1f7s3j7,WIBTA if I gave my bf an ultimatum?,"FINAL EDIT.: Please stop being up the cats in this post. It’s not about the cats, there’s no problem with them at all, it’s a matter of the other things mentioned in this post. It’s not a SMALL house or apartment. It’s a large house with tons of space. I know it’s a lot of cats but I rescue animals and his family is okay with that. I’m tired of having to respond to comments about the cats. His family was happy to have them and doesn’t see a problem with it so neither should anyone else.

I (19 trans ftm) moved out of my parents house about a year ago and have moved 4 times since them. My most recent move was in with my boyfriend (20 m), his parents have allowed me to bring almost all my pets, had to give two of the kittens up for adoption. They were adopted together and are in their forever home. But I still have the other 5 cats and my puppy. 

My boyfriend’s room was a complete MESS when I first moved in, I talked to him about cleaning it up and he still hasn’t. He’s constantly agreeing to clean something when I ask to, and constantly saying the mess is getting to him too but he doesn’t do anything about it. I literally have nowhere else to go but I can’t keep living in FILTH. He won’t even clean out the cat litter box. He said he wanted to help take care of the cats but I haven’t seen him do one damn thing for them unless I ask. 

He straight up told me one day that “I don’t do anything unless I’m asked to.” That’s a HUGE problem for me. He won’t even take out the trash if it’s full! He said he’d clean out the closet so I have space for my stuff but he HASN’T. So my stuff STILL ISNT EVEN IN THE ROOM. I haven’t even been able to put all of my clothes in the room (I don’t even have very many because of how often I’ve had to move this past year) I love his family, and I love him but I don’t know how much longer I can deal with this.

EDIT: I was more than willing to give my animals up for adoption, his parents said it was okay and even happily brought them in and absolutely love my animals, even help take care of them just because they want to. I never asked them to. And my bf OFFERED to help with the animals. Even before the animals were there he wouldn’t pick up his room to help me move my stuff in. I should have specified that, that’s my bad.

Extra edit: I should also specify 3 of the kittens were in the process of finding homes for. These are animals I rescued before I had moved in with him, so I’ll only have 2 cats and a dog when we find homes for the other kittens. His family is helping find homes for them.

1,1f7pamx,AITA for refusing to let my family hang a pride flag?,"I (17 M) am queer. I’ve been out to my family for a while now and despite some problems, they have always been supportive. While my parents aren’t entirely sure where the line between supportive and overbearing is—or sometimes how to listen to queer people on queer issues—they do a good job. 

Where I live in canada, there has been more and more anti-LGBTQ presence. I won’t go into detail, but this year our pride event was fenced and had security. As well, our pride prom was entirely cancelled due to concern for attendees. Completely to my support, my parents had signs on our yard to the sentiment of ‘Protect Trans Kids’ and ‘Trans care saves lives’, etc etc. They were recently stolen and or vandalized by people that were not caught on our camera.

My mom got her back up about this, wanting to double down and be more aggressive with the support. She wanted to put a pride flag up. Of course, she wanted to put it up outside, on our porch/lawn. She mentioned it around me and I shut it down pretty quickly. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable hanging my flag so much as in a window, so I didn’t want her putting it out in our lawn. I explain how discouraging it feels to have someone take that down or vandalize it. How unsafe that can make me and other people feel. Especially since it’s on my property, cleaning denoting me as the queer person. 

She snapped back quickly, saying that I didn’t get to tell her what not to do and how it’s not about me etc etc. She said she *needs* people to see that she’s supporting queer people. I told her that wouldn’t make me feel supported, especially not if it was taken or vandalized. We went back and forth in conversation where I felt I was being put to the side and that my comfort didn’t matter. In the end, I told her that she was being performative with her support if she refused to listen to me and my comfort on this.

2,1f8els5,AITA for asking my sister if she shared personal information I told her in confidence?,"So, I (28/F) recently found out from my nieces that my sister (34/F) shared a funny childhood story, which I didn’t mind at all. We all laughed about it, and it was fine. However, it made me wonder if other, more personal things I had shared with her, like details about a difficult time I went through, had also been shared with others. I wasn't overly concerned with it, but enough to shoot her a message to check up. Didn't think it would be much big of a deal.

So I asked her directly if she had shared any of those personal details with anyone. I thought it was a simple and straightforward question—just a way to make sure that my private matters remained private. I wasn’t trying to accuse her of anything, just wanted some reassurance.

But my sister got really upset and said that she didn’t like being put in a position where she felt like she had to prove that she was trustworthy. She told me that she didn’t appreciate feeling like I was controlling her or questioning her integrity, especially since she hadn't done anything to make me doubt her. She felt that my question was unfair and made her feel uncomfortable.

I do emphatize with her, and expressed so. I said I can imagine it feels hurtful if you feel like someone close to you doubts your trust. I tried to explain that it wasn’t about not trusting her, but rather just my own insecurities about how private information is handled. I said that I still trusted her but wanted to confirm that certain things were kept confidential. But she wasn’t satisfied with this explanation and said that I shouldn’t need to ask for reassurance if I really trusted her. Saying she set a boundary, the boundary being, not justifying herself. I told her I would listen to that boundary and that I wouldn't push to get an answer to my initial question. 

At the end of the convo I said I felt like she feels mad over the issue, so it would be best to talk about it at a different time. It was 12am, she must've been tired. Maybe had a bad day. After that, no replies. So I assume we'll talk about it more later.

I asked my mother the exact same thing, she said ""No of course I wouldn't share private matters with others"" and it was over and done with.

And honestly, my sisters defendant attitude made me feel kind of suspicious of her. It feels like she doesn't want to answer the question because she knows she's guilty of something. So this whole conversation actually made me feel distrustful towards her. Which I hope is misplaced.

I do am wary of expressing these distrustful feelings towards her that resulted from this convo. I feel like she will be even more upset. But I feel like it's something to talk about as well. I don't want to make matters worse though. But I also don't want to end this whole thing with me feeling distrustful towards my sister.

My sister is very important to me, she's my best friend. And we're very close. I hope when we talk about this later we can resolve it.

6,1f8ehcs,AITA for being honest with a young mom?,"My youngest son Danny (5) started kindergarten last week. One of his friends from preschool is also in the same class. The boy, Lukas, is a sweet kid and I was happy to find out they would be together for kindergarten. 

Lukas's mom is only 19. Last year I tried to befriend her as our sons got along well and most the other parents avoided her and gossiped a lot about her behind her back.

On Friday we got the boys together for a playdate at my home. We had a nice chat while the boys played, and she opened up about how difficult it has been for her interacting with other parents. Afterwards she offered to host the next playdate.

I politely told her no but let her know I'm happy to do playdates at my house or at a playground. She was a little taken back and asked me why. I told her the truth, that I don't feel comfortable going to her home.

This sounds harsh but I have my reasonings. A small reason (that I could overlook) is she lives in a tiny apartment in a bad part of town. At my home there's a lot more space for the boys to play both indoors and outdoors. 

One of my bigger reasonings is her boyfriend. I've heard a lot about him from a mom of one of my oldest son's friends. Her daughter went to school with him and has only horrible things to say about him. My biggest relevant concern is that according to her he is involved with drugs and has a criminal record and a pending case. I obviously don't want my son in a home like this due to safety concerns. 

I hate myself a little bit for my reasoning as a lot of it is based off gossip. However, as a mom I feel my instincts about not going over there are right. Even just for the possibility of her boyfriend being there alone as every interaction I've had with him has been negative, he's very unfriendly, cold, and I've seen him be rude to other parents at pick up.

When I told Lukas's mom that her boyfriend was part of my reasoning, she became irritated. I told her I didn't understand why she was with a guy like that. She accused me of being like the other moms and spreading gossip, she claims half the things said about him aren't even true. I expressed to her that she'd probably have an easier time getting along with other parents if she didn't let her boyfriend around the school and should expect gossip if she's going to have a guy like that around her son.

She left mad as hell. I told my husband what happened, and he thinks I was somewhat an asshole. He suggested I could have protected her feelings and prevented a falling out by giving other reasonings to not going to her home. He said it's going to suck if the boys can't hangout anymore if she holds this against me and he also feels bad for the mom as it could have been nice for her to have an older mom in her circle.

I politely told her no but let her know I'm happy to do playdates at my house or at a playground. She was a little taken back and asked me why. I told her the truth, that I don't feel comfortable going to her home.

This sounds harsh but I have my reasonings. A small reason (that I could overlook) is she lives in a tiny apartment in a bad part of town. At my home there's a lot more space for the boys to play both indoors and outdoors. 

One of my bigger reasonings is her boyfriend. I've heard a lot about him from a mom of one of my oldest son's friends. Her daughter went to school with him and has only horrible things to say about him. My biggest relevant concern is that according to her he is involved with drugs and has a criminal record and a pending case. I obviously don't want my son in a home like this due to safety concerns. 

I hate myself a little bit for my reasoning as a lot of it is based off gossip. However, as a mom I feel my instincts about not going over there are right. Even just for the possibility of her boyfriend being there alone as every interaction I've had with him has been negative, he's very unfriendly, cold, and I've seen him be rude to other parents at pick up.

When I told Lukas's mom that her boyfriend was part of my reasoning, she became irritated. I told her I didn't understand why she was with a guy like that. She accused me of being like the other moms and spreading gossip, she claims half the things said about him aren't even true. I expressed to her that she'd probably have an easier time getting along with other parents if she didn't let her boyfriend around the school and should expect gossip if she's going to have a guy like that around her son.

She left mad as hell. I told my husband what happened, and he thinks I was somewhat an asshole. He suggested I could have protected her feelings and prevented a falling out by giving other reasonings to not going to her home. He said it's going to suck if the boys can't hangout anymore if she holds this against me and he also feels bad for the mom as it could have been nice for her to have an older mom in her circle.

7,1f8eetm,AITAH for being the main reason they broke up,"I (19F) went home for the holiday weekend after she had told me and everyone else I wasn’t allowed too. 

A little back story her (20F) and I were dating best friends. Since day one of ever meeting her she went through and picked every detail about me and decided to not like me and make it where I can’t do anything without her permission, and I had planned on moving in with my boyfriend (21M) a couple months after meeting her. After she had heard I was moving in made a huge deal with her college so she could drop out and move in with the boyfriends before I could. After she had moved in, I had a very off vibe from her because whenever she was at the house with just my boyfriend she was always trying to come into his room and inviting herself everywhere my boyfriend went. Once I moved in I voiced my concerns and we found a place without them. But I think that’s where things got worse. If our boyfriends were to go on a guys trip she would invite herself to my house and wait there until I got off work and would just walk into my house behind me. I don’t know if it was a control thing where she had to know where I was and had a say where I was. 

 So our boyfriends had planned a camping trip as a guys trip for the holiday near my home town. After I had already planned on going and seeing my family for the weekend before they had planned the camping trip. Days before I had left for home I got a text from her saying I better be staying home because with her boyfriend being that direction I could not go to my parents house to spend it with them. I texted back telling her that I’m now way in hell can she tell me I can’t go see my parents no matter where her boyfriend is or not. 

So here’s where I can see I became the ass hole after the boys got settled at camp I decided that I would go see my boyfriend for the day and posted a picture for her to see knowing it would make a fight between her and me and her and her boyfriend I never thought it would make them break up but I wanted it known that she is not in charge of me and I can go wherever I please. 

When the boys got camp cleaned up and were ready to head back home they had stopped by my parents house so that they could shower and so my boyfriend could see my parents and that’s where things got bad she was calling and texting her boyfriend and then out of nowhere we all got a text of her saying because of all of you not being able to respect her boundaries she was leaving him and she did.

8,1f8e4f2,AITA for how I handled my loud neighbor?,"So I (22f) live in an apartment on my college campus. I have a neighbor (m20/21) who has lived in the unit next to mine for a little over a year. He's a gamer and likes to play late at night, which I totally get. We're college students so the only time we really have for our hobbies is late at night. The thing is, he is so loud. The walls in our building are pretty thin so whenever he gets loud, I hear everything. And this guy gets loud a lot, I'm constantly hearing yelling about whatever game he is playing.

Even though I don't like how loud he is, I've been tolerating it because we still share the space and whatnot. I've been dealing with it, but I reached my breaking point last week. It was about 1am and this guy was still shouting and yelling and keeping me up. I can deal with it when it's like 10 or 11pm, but it was so late and I had to be up early for classes.

This is where I might be the AH, so left a note on his door that said: Just shut up. Some people need to sleep. I personally don't think that I'm in the wrong because I've been dealing with this guy for a year already and I can't do it for another year. My friends and parents think I was too mean.

9,1f8e2yr,WIBTA if I snitched on my dormmate for vaping?,"I just moved in to my college dorm for my second year. For some context, I'm in a dorm that's a suite so there's a couple rooms that share a bathroom. I'm in one of the singles and Nathan (the vaper) is in one of the doubles.

Anyways, Nathan has recently moved into the dorm and he vapes. His roommate in the double (Matt) and I both are not cool with the vaping but we have told Nathan that we're fine if he vapes in the dorm but only if he doesn't do it often and blows the smoke out of the window. Nathan has not followed either of these suggestions and constantly is being disruptive during the night, keeping Matt up. I haven't asked Nathan to stop vaping completely yet but I'm 99% sure he wouldn't follow that suggestion either so it feels pointless to. I really do not want to deal with it the whole year but I'm worried about the trouble he'd be in for vaping in the dorm building plus snitching isn't really a cool thing to do.

But, if after I tell him to stop vaping completely and he does not, would I be an asshole for telling the RA about his vaping?

Thanks!

10,1f8dtvs,AITAH for not letting this man that I only known for a week and a half to drive my truck.,"I 34 F him 42M was paired up for work.  He threw out there multiple times that he is very single and would request to spend more time with me outside of work.

I let him know that being single is peaceful and that I am very busy with work,  going back to school and getting state license.

Everything that I was saying was going through one ear and out the other. He would constantly, everyday,  multiple times a day, call me, text me, ask me can he take me out on a date and spend more time with him outside of work.

I am an independent contractor and if this was any other gig I would have refused. It was a very lucrative paying a couple of thousand dollars over a couple of days. So my goal was to keep the peace and softly reject him.  Unfortunately I found myself repeatedly rejecting him which became annoying like constantly talking to a child.

This past Saturday 8-31-2024 we were talking on the phone. I mentioned my pickup truck with a HEMI. First thing out of his mouth was ""OOH I WOULD LOVE TO DRIVE THAT TRUCK."" Then he flat out ask me can he drive my truck. I was in shock that he even asked me that so there was a little bit of silence on the phone. Then he proceeded again a 2nd time asking me can he drive my truck. I was irritated and annoyed that he would even ask me that so I got off the phone and trust me he wasn't too happy about that a different side of him came out. 

To give you some understanding of the dates we started working with each other 8-20-2024. He asked me this question 8-31-2024. The last time we seen each other and work together was 8-23-2024 a week ago at that point.

 In that week I have not answered any of his phone calls. I would reply to his text maybe once or twice a day to keep things cordial. The conversation would go longer if he brings up work-related issues and somewhere along the line he would convert the conversation to small talk.

 I honestly did not like having conversations with him because any small talk that I would make with him he would use it as an opportunity to implant himself. 

""I can cut your grass for you, you need gas in your car, you want to go get something to eat?, I can fix that for you, I can do that for you, oh are you off work come and meet me, are you free can I come over, can I cook for you""

""oh you going to the grocery store can I go to the grocery store with you? you want me to buy some food for you?""

So I got to the point to where I didn't want to talk to him about anything. I just didn't want to have any bad blood or for him feeling any kind of way since we still have upcoming projects together.

Anyway, I know this was long I appreciate if you made it all the way to the end. 

He said that I was looking at things negatively and that I am a mean ass woman.

So am I the asshole for shutting down the phone conversation and not allowing this man to drive my truck?

11,1f8dmwe,AITA for lying to my parents? ,"I’m 20 and currently living with my parents. About two years ago when I entered the uni I moved out and was living in the dorm (in another city) for a couple of months, but because of some things (doesn’t really important) I had to return. Then after a year I moved out again and it was better this time, I also got a job and even got to live with my cousin for about a month in the flat he was renting. But once again we had difficulties and we had to move out, so both of us had to return home again. 
About 4 months ago I got a job, not the best but definitely not the worst. I have the office literally 5 min away from my parents’ apartments, so there is no point to move out in this city. 
The main problem here is that I failed to pass my exams. I won’t be on my third year in uni and I can’t tell my parents. I wanted to apply for an academic leave but it really seems to me now that I won’t get it. 
My parents currently have financial problems so they won’t be able to pay for uni (I was on a budget basis). I also can’t afford to pay for that. Won’t take any loans cuz I’m my country it’s just stupid. 
I’m not officially expelled but I’m a few steps away from that. And even now I had to start lying to my parents. 
I’m going to tell them truth in a year, when I’m financially stable (really hope that everything will be like that). Cuz if I tell them now… I can’t imagine what will happen. They believe that high education is a must have and I won’t get a normal job without it. 
I have NEVER wanted to study in uni in the first place. I hate it. So I’m kinda glad. But I feel guilty for lying.
Will my parents forgive me not only quitting but lying in addition to that?
 
I also can’t move out to another city cuz I can’t afford that too. I feel stuck to be honest. I feel embarrassed to celebrate my 20th birthday while living with my parents. It’s also hard for me to keep up with all these changes, live is moving so fast. 

So AITA for lying to my parents? Will they forgive me? 

UPD: no, my parents are not okay with my choice. I tried to ask them about their opinion on quitting the uni (theoretically), but the were against that. They want me to study and quite the job if needed, but not uni. 
And once again, I was on a budget basis and they were not paying anything. Moreover, I was getting a scholarship. 

I want to make it clearer why exactly I’m not telling everything rn. 
1) if I tell them everything rn, they will be not only shocked and disappointed but they will be worried. I don’t have a good enough job for now and I am quitting uni in addition to that. + living with them. 
2) if I tell them in a year or so, I’ll be in a better financial situation and they won’t be worried about me that much, cuz I will be able to live alone and be okay on my own. They will have a proof that I don’t need the high education. And I’ll also explain that neither them nor I could afford to pay for my uni then. So they will understand that I had no choice.

13,1f8d8x8,AITAH for not discussing purchasing a house with GF,"I have been thinking about this for a couple weeks and would like some input. My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years now. At the beginning of the relationships, I had told her I wanted to buy a house. Fast forward to today, I am under contract for a house.

A few weeks ago, I had mentioned I was ready to buy, and a week later I found a house I liked and put in an offer. The seller accepted and we are now under contract. All of this happened within about a two weeks span. I didn't really get much of her input on the matter, and feel pretty lousy about it now. It is a great price point 259k in an okay area with a garage. It is a 2 bed + den & 2 full bath house. Did I mess up by not getting her input? I feel like she is a bit upset about it but hasn't out right said anything.  I have brought it up a couple times, but the conversation never really goes anyway.

Would you be upset about this? Did I mess up, AITAH?

My girlfriend and I have been together for a couple years now. At the beginning of the relationships, I had told her I wanted to buy a house. Fast forward to today, I am under contract for a house.

A few weeks ago, I had mentioned I was ready to buy, and a week later I found a house I liked and put in an offer. The seller accepted and we are now under contract. All of this happened within about a two weeks span. I didn't really get much of her input on the matter, and feel pretty lousy about it now. It is a great price point 259k in an okay area with a garage. It is a 2 bed + den & 2 full bath house. Did I mess up by not getting her input? I feel like she is a bit upset about it but hasn't out right said anything.  I have brought it up a couple times, but the conversation never really goes anyway.

Would you be upset about this? Did I mess up, AITAH?

14,1f8d6gp,AITA for storming out of a room and embarrassing my boyfriend because he spoiled Jaws?,"I never saw *Jaws*. I wasn’t alive in 1975, so I missed the craze surrounding it. I didn’t watch it in theaters like my boyfriend’s parents did. Neither of my parents were fans of it. I never felt the urge to watch it myself.

Over the Labor Day weekend, my boyfriend’s family had *Jaws* on briefly. I was in a folding chair not facing the TV and not paying attention to it.

“Maybe he shouldn’t do that,” said my boyfriend’s sister.

I turned and saw a man boiling a shark head in a vat of water or something like that. He looked to be a shark enthusiast or collector.

“It’s worked out great for him until the events of this movie,” replied my boyfriend. Then he and his dad laughed.

I, realizing that a plot point had been spoiled, walked out of the room and upstairs to my boyfriend’s bedroom. I texted him “I’m not going to sit there and have a movie I haven’t seen, which you know that I haven’t seen, and which is on that poster [of 100 movies that we have talked about watching], be spoiled. So let me know when you guys are done watching Jaws, ok?”

He says that I was being unreasonable in “storming out of the room.” I told him that I just don’t like this “wink wink nudge nudge” spoiler talk that people who have seen a movie do when they’re watching with new viewers. They think they’re being clever, or they’re giving hints of what to watch out for. But they’re spoiling the movie, and it’s frustrating. He insists that wasn’t what he was doing and that he “assumed everyone who wanted to see *Jaws* had already seen it.” He used this phrasing because he knows his grandmother and sister haven’t seen the movie either. They just don’t care like I do.

His family thinks I was unreasonable to walk out of the room. They say that I should have told them I hadn’t seen *Jaws*, and they wouldn’t have had it on. I said that I was totally fine with it being on, as long as it was being watched quietly. I don’t want to tell people they can’t watch movies just because I haven’t seen them yet. The ONLY thing that bothers me is the spoiler-laden side talk that some people insist on doing with movies, which I think is rude and inconsiderate. I chose to walk out of the room rather than confront anyone about it.

I personally don’t care what movie it is or how unlikely I am to ever see it. If I have the choice to be in a room where *Birth of a Nation* is being spoiled, and a room where *Birth of a Nation* isn’t being spoiled, I’m taking the spoiler free room. Why wouldn’t I? Iconic movie or not, I’ve made it this far in my life without having it spoiled, spending time around people way less intelligent and considerate than my boyfriend’s family. I don’t think that’s a crazy ask!

I talked with him back and forth for maybe 5 minutes about how he can’t just grab the paper tomorrow, or on Thursday when he has the class again, but I just give in, not knowing he’s intended to print it out.

19,1f8cc4t,AITA for how I told my family that I have cancer?,"I (24F) discovered a couple weeks ago that I have breast cancer. It came as a real shock to me because I had practically no symptoms. I was at the hospital for a different reason and from there referred internally to the mammography suite. (That's not really important to the story but just a little context on how I was diagnosed). But the good news is that doctors were able to catch it early and the outlook is good.

My problem, aside from the obvious, is that I had no idea how to tell my family. I knew they would panic regardless, which is understandable as I lost two great aunts to breast cancer and my dad also has stomach cancer. So I just kind of avoided telling them because there's a lot going on in my family at the minute. I didn't want to put any more on their plate. But then I did my first round of chemo and it floored me. I knew then that I had to tell them because I genuinely couldn't go through that alone again. 

This is where I'm possibly the AH. My family are really bad with emotional stuff. We're not good at expressing ourselves. We can laugh and make jokes and that but when it comes to serious matters we're all quite awkward. And I knew that this was going to be awkward and I didn't really want to face that. My mum, I could deal with, she's a lot better with stuff like this but I really didn't want to tell my dad. He's the suffer in silence type and I knew it would break him to learn about this, especially since he's going through the same thing.

So, to tell them, I bought a cake and a card to give my dad. They said, ""Congratulations! It's twins!"" with the diagnosis/outreach letter from my GP.

22,1f8bzrv,"AITA? He got me a caravan, but I want to leave","I grew up with my mother. My father was never a big part of my life. 
For some back story, at the age of 9 I started to have severe seizures which led to brain surgery at 14 as we found it was a brain tumor. 
I had side effects caused by the surgery. speech issues, CFS, cognitive issues etc.

During the surgery I reconnected with my father and about 8 months after surgery I decided to move in with him to try and build a better relationship. 
This resulted in him having me upkeep the home and drink with him on weekends. the drinking severely stunted my recovery. 
After 8 months I was exhausted and moved back with my mother.

I was later diagnosed with Endometriosis and had 2 surgeries aswell ADHD and depression for which i am medicated. As a result of the Endo and CFS I am often exhausted and in pain, simply put. I am unable to work and live off of a disability benifit provided by the government. 
A few years pass and now at 25 I make the decision to move out of home. I didn't feel comfortable in the larger city so moved back to my home town. 
Due to the difficulty in housing I was only able to rent a room from an older disabled man we will call Paul. 
As someone else with disabilities I thought me and paul would get along. I was wrong, as it turns out he had a thing for me and would walk around the house naked, touch my shoulder and waist inappropriately when I was in the kitchen etc so I ended up buying a lock for my bedroom door.

After a discussion with my father he offered to take out a loan and buy me a caravan to live in on his little life style block where I would rent to buy. Of course I jumped at this opportunity to be out of that house and away from Paul. 
Granted at this point in time I have no friends here as i do not work or get out of the house often. I only have my cat of 8 years and my grandmother who takes me to volunteer at her shop once a week for a few hours.
It's been about 5 months since I have moved into the caravan and in a span of 4 weeks everything went down hill. My cat was diagnosed with cancer and passed away which resulted in a near 3k debt to the vet's, my father and step mother have decided that my medical conditions are not real and that I am faking it to be lazy despite having all the medical records and history as well as doctors to back it up.

They have told me I need to stop using them as an excuse and how I need to get a job. That this is not my home and I need to understand that this was temporary (which was never mentioned) and how i need to look at moving. 
A close family friend has offered for me to park up on her large property back in the city with my mother which i am wanting to accept as I have friends and family back there.

I was later diagnosed with Endometriosis and had 2 surgeries aswell ADHD and depression for which i am medicated. As a result of the Endo and CFS I am often exhausted and in pain, simply put. I am unable to work and live off of a disability benifit provided by the government. 
A few years pass and now at 25 I make the decision to move out of home. I didn't feel comfortable in the larger city so moved back to my home town. 
Due to the difficulty in housing I was only able to rent a room from an older disabled man we will call Paul. 
As someone else with disabilities I thought me and paul would get along. I was wrong, as it turns out he had a thing for me and would walk around the house naked, touch my shoulder and waist inappropriately when I was in the kitchen etc so I ended up buying a lock for my bedroom door.

After a discussion with my father he offered to take out a loan and buy me a caravan to live in on his little life style block where I would rent to buy. Of course I jumped at this opportunity to be out of that house and away from Paul. 
Granted at this point in time I have no friends here as i do not work or get out of the house often. I only have my cat of 8 years and my grandmother who takes me to volunteer at her shop once a week for a few hours.
It's been about 5 months since I have moved into the caravan and in a span of 4 weeks everything went down hill. My cat was diagnosed with cancer and passed away which resulted in a near 3k debt to the vet's, my father and step mother have decided that my medical conditions are not real and that I am faking it to be lazy despite having all the medical records and history as well as doctors to back it up.

They have told me I need to stop using them as an excuse and how I need to get a job. That this is not my home and I need to understand that this was temporary (which was never mentioned) and how i need to look at moving. 
A close family friend has offered for me to park up on her large property back in the city with my mother which i am wanting to accept as I have friends and family back there. 
AITA for taking the caravan and moving away from my F and SM when they were the ones who helped me get it in the first place? 
I am paying the weekly bill to my F and SM and have full intentions to keep doing so until it is payed off",0.0,-0.0050228433683514595,0,1
23,1f8btc6,WIBTA for wanting more child support ,"I (25M) have a child (5F) with my ex girlfriend (24F). We broke up in May 2024 after being together for 6 years, and she moved out of my apartment to one of her coworker's house. 
My ex and I discussed after our breakup about a child support/custody arrangement (where I have sole custody until she has a permanent residence) since she's no longer living with my daughter and I. We discussed how my ex didn't want to go through the court system (kind of regretting that decision), and we agreed on her paying me $150 on the 1st and 15th of every month. So far, my ex has paid the child support payments (bar the latest), however it's always late (10-15 days), never on the agreed upon dates that we have set. The first payment was supposed to be paid the day after we signed the paperwork.
I tried to CMA by having a notary witness us both sign the agreement, but she only pays after she gets whatever plans or trips she goes on paid for. It's frustrating to me because, imo as a parent, your first thought should be of your child's wellbeing.
My mother says that I should wait to file the papers until after she hasn't paid for a month, but honestly I have been struggling to support my daughter on my paycheck alone. 
$300 a month isn't even close to what it costs to raise our child, so I'm wondering if I'd be an asshole if I contacted the child support agency to get a court order for more child support.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments. As one comment stated, I would be an asshole if I continued to wait to file, so I'll get the paperwork and file it tomorrow.

I asked where the charger was to which she responded “I took it to work and have left it there” naturally this isn’t a big deal so I just asked why she’d take the plug when she could’ve just taken the wire. She then responded that she couldn’t use a wire without a plug? She works in a pretty new building built within the last 10 years or so, so I assumed there would be somewhere to plug in her wire without needing to take my plug. There aren’t many staff where she works so I know she probably wouldn’t be able to ask to borrow someone else’s. I asked why she didn’t plug it in to one of the computers in the office or on the front desk, she said that they don’t have usb-c plugs in them to which I responded “oh that’s weird” she then got extremely agitated about it shouting at me saying that it “wasn’t f*cking weird” my computer at work, in our home office and all of the laptops in our house have usb-c ports and I thought  it was weird her work didn’t have any.

25,1f8bi10,WIBTA for attending my partner’s father’s final goodbye despite her ex being there?,"I'm a 45-year-old man, and my partner Jane, who is also 45, and I have been together for 6 years. We briefly dated in high school, but that relationship didn’t last. Jane’s father never liked me—he was the type who didn’t like anyone, really. He was grumpy, emotionally distant, and often borderline abusive, even to his own family. Clearly, our relationship wasn't ideal; I didn't tolerate any of his behavior.

Jane and I broke up in high school, and years later Jane went on to have a long-term relationship with John. Her father actually liked John and they became good friends.

Now Jane and I have been together for the last 6 years, and recently, Jane’s father passed away. While discussing arrangements for his funeral. Jane's family believes that a) John should attend because of their close relationship, and b) I shouldn’t be there. I understand why John’s presence is expected (that’s fine), but I’m really struggling with the idea of being excluded.

The reason given is that John himself feels he’s not over his past with Jane and might have trouble seeing me there. What’s been most surprising is that Jane is backing this decision, even though it seems like John is making this about his unresolved feelings rather than about the funeral.

I’m feeling hurt and confused. I get that these events can be emotionally charged, but I think it’s unfair to ask me to stay away, especially when it’s coming from my own partner. I mentioned to Jane that John’s reaction seems unreasonable and even called him out for it, but I’m also disappointed in Jane for not supporting me.

So, WIBTA for wanting to attend the final farewell despite everything?

26,1f8bexc,AITA for standing my ground against my girlfriend’s best friend?,"
Backstory:
Me(26m) and my girlfriend(26f) has been together just about two years. She’s been living in a dorm with her best friend since we met. I’ll call the best friend, Sofi. She also has another roommate which is my friend. Let’s call her Lola. We met thru Lola. 

In the beginning Sofi was ok. I work at a bar, where they often hang out. I usually join when my shift end. After some time, I started to realise that once Sofi became drunk she spoke loudly, and had no filters. Multiple incidents where she shared my girlfriend secrets to not only our mutual friends, but also strangers. She does also have a problem with party drugs. My girlfriend has tried to call her out on it, but she usually does not remember and keeps on doing it. I’ve started to distance myself when we’re out, as it’s both embarrassing and annoying. 

Now, the problem. 

My girlfriend is moving in with me, and therefore the dorm would need a new roomie. Sofi and Lola made it clear that if they did not find someone to replace her quickly, she would have to pay her part of the bills until they did. I was visiting, and told Sofi that I had a buddy that needed a place. Neat, respectful and a good match for them. Sofi was super excited and said that they had talked about finding a guy. I asked her when they could be available to meet him. She gave a date and a time. I then asked my buddy and Lola if that was working for them. I didn’t see a problem with that, as Lola are better friends with me, than my girlfriend and Sofi. Lola told me she was not interested in a guy. So I cancelled the meet up.

A week later me and my girlfriend was meeting her sister and her new boyfriend. I’ve only met her sister once, so this was important for me. Sofi asked to join, and my girlfriend said yes. Sofi showed up with a friend, and we quickly realised the she was wasted. I was in the middle of a conversation with my girlfriend’s sister when Sofi abruptly started to loudly attack me for being too involved and that I shouldn’t have spoken to Lola about my buddy before she did. I told her that it was the wrong place and time, and that we could talk about it later. She kept raise her voice and after some minutes I cut her off, telling her that the entire bar could hear and to shut up. She left for the bathroom.
Her friend asked where she went, and in the moment of heat I replied “probably in the bathroom doing drugs”. Her friend went after her, and once she got back up, she told me she found Sofi with white powder under her nose.

The next day she told my girlfriend she didn’t want to see me again before I apologised for “spilling the tea” about her drug abuse to her friend. I told my girlfriend that if she wanted an apology she could scrape it off my shoe. My girlfriend tried to have my back, but Sofi is persistent.

I (21F) live with my mom (45F) in a very limited space. While she was rearranging stuff in the closet, she complained about my jacket being in the way and that I needed to start hanging it up. I expressed what I had expressed to her before, it doesn’t make sense (to me) to hang it up every day when I use it literally everyday. It makes more sense to just put it on the self and grab it. 

She said that we both need to work on us both being able to move out so that we can live the way we want to, so that she doesn’t have to lower herself to my level of cleanliness. We got into an argument about how she always makes it seem like I’m just so messy when I’m honestly not. I’m a little disorganized, but I’m not gross. 

She also said that me saying it’s easier is the problem, because I just want life to be easy, and how me not wanting to hang my jacket up is just a lack of discipline. 

I honestly don’t see how I’m wrong, I just want to put my jacket in an easy to grab spot since I wear it every time I go out, but my mom sees it as clutter and being messy. 

I put my jacket back where I had it originally, and although she hasn’t said anything about it now, I know that she will at some point but I genuinely don’t see what I’m doing wrong.

29,1f8apws,AITA for not paying my friend’s parking ticket? ,"Throwaway since all my friends know my main Reddit account. So I (24M) live in a city with good public transit so I don’t need to own a car. However, my friend (23F) often leaves the city to go hiking so she owns a car. 

Anyway, I wanted to go see one of my friends who lives far outside the city, and my friend very generously offered to let me borrow her car for the trip. I borrowed the car and made sure to take care of it and I returned it clean and with a full tank of gas (it had 3/4ths of a tank when I first got it). My friend lives on a street with \*monthly\* street cleaning and she pretty much always parks her car on this street. Cars parked there need to be moved the morning of the \*third\* Wednesday of every month for the street cleaner to get through. Any cars left there will receive a parking ticket. 

My friend has been super busy with work so she hasn’t been going hiking much and consequently has not been using her car often. I dropped the car off on the \*second\* Wednesday of the month. Being that there was a full week until the car had to be moved, I was not concerned at all with parking it there. When I returned the keys, I told my friend “I parked it on the same street you always park on”. 

Well, a week went by and the car was never used and my friend ended up getting a parking ticket. After she discovered the ticket, she told me that I should pay for it since I was the last to use the car and should have been more mindful of the street cleaning schedule, or at least have done a better job warning her about it. 

I think this is totally unfair since first, I told her where I parked it, and second, street cleaning is the same day every month. Shouldn’t she have some kind of reminder or an event on her calendar that her car needs to be moved from the same place she always parks it? If I had parked it on Monday or Tuesday when street cleaning was that Wednesday I would totally get having to pay the parking ticket, but after a full week in advance?

  
Either way, I told her that I didn’t think it was fair for me to pay it and now she’s pretty upset and not talking to me.

After she discovered the ticket, she told me that I should pay for it since I was the last to use the car and should have been more mindful of the street cleaning schedule, or at least have done a better job warning her about it. 

I think this is totally unfair since first, I told her where I parked it, and second, street cleaning is the same day every month. Shouldn’t she have some kind of reminder or an event on her calendar that her car needs to be moved from the same place she always parks it? If I had parked it on Monday or Tuesday when street cleaning was that Wednesday I would totally get having to pay the parking ticket, but after a full week in advance?

  
Either way, I told her that I didn’t think it was fair for me to pay it and now she’s pretty upset and not talking to me. So, am I the asshole? ",0.0,1.0512583255767822,1,0
30,1f8ahq5,AITA for accepting reward money for finding  a lost dog?,"UPDATE: thank you all for the responses - I genuinely couldn’t tell if I was in the wrong and it was making me feel bad. After what happened today though I feel way less remorse:

Today, someone with a different name than the dog owner requested the same amount of money back via PayPal and said it was on behalf of the dog owner for “fraudulent charges” related to the dog and threatened further action. I looked this person up and it looks like it’s just a family friend, but the profile pic is the scales of justice -  I think they are trying to pretend to be a lawyer?? Many words were misspelled so I know it’s not legit, not that there would be reasonable grounds to take any additional action anyway. 

To think I went through so much trouble trying to find this person just for it to get out of hand like this.

I screenshotted the texts and the original Facebook posts stating the reward amount like some of you recommended and it seems like it was just in time, so thank you.


Original post:

My sister found a dog on the side of the road, no collar, and she found out later, no microchip. She brought her to my house after giving her a bath, feeding her and letting her sleep at her house overnight, because she isn’t allowed to have dogs in her apartment and she was worried she would get in trouble.

As soon as she brought her over, I started to look online for the owner. She was really well behaved and potty trained so I didn’t think she was a stray. I found the owner as he had posted about it in a lost pets group for my area, so I connected with him and scheduled a time to meet up and give his dog back.

Now, the Facebook post offered a $500 reward. My sister is kind of (really really) down bad right now and she would really benefit from the money. When I met up with the dog owner, he offered to send the reward, I took him up on it and then sent it to my sister.

A couple of hours later, he texted me saying that he is upset that he had to pay for his own dog back. He also said he was only a teenager and hoped he wouldn’t have to pay the reward out. I feel bad, because I wouldn’t have taken the money if I was the one that found the dog, but I wasn’t. He also made me feel like I just hustled him for money or something.

I responded to him and said “sorry, I’ve already given the money to my sister so I can’t return it to you.”

So, AITA for accepting the reward money (not returning it)?

32,1f89kuj,AITA for calling out my BIL for staring at my chest? And my daughter’s chest?,"My BIL - let’s call him Dan, visits my husband (his brother) and me, now and then - about every 2-3 months. Every time we see him, “Dan” talks to me while staring at my chest. I’m mid 50s, decent looking but nothing to stare at. On the rare occasion my daughter joins us for the family visit, “Dan” stares at her chest too. She is 23.
Last time he visited our home, I made a motion with my fingers from my chest up to my eyes. Your basic “my eyes are up here” gesture. He did not acknowledge this and kept staring. 
I grabbed a sofa cushion and hugged it against my chest for the remainder of the evening. For reference- I was not exposing my décolletage in any way and was wearing a hoodie!

I expressed my offense and frustration to my husband (let’s call him “Jerry.”) Jerry was upset and did not realize this was going on repeatedly and said he would have words with “Dan.”
Dan has heart issues - in his mid 60s, so it’s difficult to find a time to talk about sensitive subjects as we are all afraid to upset him. 

Finally, “Jerry” my husband, called his brother and told him how upset he was and how disrespectful it was towards me that he would stare at my chest. 
“Dan” blew up at my husband and denied it. Called me a liar and how could I say this happened. Told Jerry to “take control of your wife and household” and “be a man and don’t allow this to happen “… etc. 
Jerry hung up on him. 2 weeks later “Dan” calls Jerry again to ream him out for not “being a man” and to tell him again that I’m a liar.
“Dan” proceeds to tell their sister his side of the situation - let’s call her “Debbie.” She then takes Dan’s side. 
Debbie called Jerry telling him what a liar I am and how I’m trying to drive a wedge in the family. 
We are all in our 50s and 60s….isn’t this immature?
For background, “Dan” has a history of disrespecting women openly and blatantly. My husband has mentioned  this many times and it is also quite obvious by his attitude in conversation. 
My SIL “Debbie” won’t speak to me or respond to my text or email messages. We used to have a nice friendship. 

We are the only relatives close by enough to respond if Dan has another medical event. He has alienated many other friends and neighbors. 

Am I the asshole for having called out Dan for disrespecting me and my daughter? He has alienated me and my kids, and Jerry. I could have honestly guessed he would do this but I was just so fed up with him doing this to us in my own home.

He has been cold to everyone at home and acting careless. He is in a depressive mood (hardly showering, not speaking to anyone, always wasting money on takeout). My parents have been adding to his stress with their best intentions to try and support him and push him to succeed in university however unfortunately he is uninterested (attends classes late, doesn’t study for exams, talks back to professors, ignores emails from professors…) 

Him and I used to be so close and he would talk about these things with me now not so much and he has pushed me away. He never says hi to me despite me trying to spark conversation, I tried to advise him I even sent him a long message to explain to him that I’m here for him whenever he needs me and that I will just listen if he needs to vent. I explained how important he is to me and that I will always support him. He came up to me one day and told me to stop sending him messages and that he didn’t read them. He has been showing no emotion or reaction to anything other than when he plays on his pc with his friends and is laughing.

It’s like his family is his enemy. He keeps blaming my parents for his failures and This has put a toll on our family especially my parents as they are worried about him and he has become the center of every conversation. My parents aren’t perfect however I can see them try so hard and they really do the best they can.

Anyway the point is his birthday is coming up and I have lots of gifts that I have been waiting to give to him however with his attitude now and how he doesn’t even acknowledge my presence I don’t know if I should give him anything because I fear that he may be a jerk about it or he won’t care and just toss whatever I give him. My mother has told me to just wait till he is more conscious about his current state and maybe then give him what I have been saving as he doesn’t deserve anything now, is acting entitled, and he doesn’t respect anyone at home and is quite self centered he only speaks to my father to ask him for money to order despite having ready meals at home.

35,1f899ll,AITA for painting my nails during an OFF CAMERA meeting while WFH,"I (F22) WFH as a software engineer. I'm in the process of moving out but am currently at home while I wait for my lease to start. Twice a week, my mom (F53) also WFH and we're both in the house in our rooms. My mom thinks that I'm going to get fired if I do anything that deviates from my job (e.g. spend more than 5 minutes in the bathroom, walk away from my desk to make another coffee or fill my water bottle, wash the dish I used for a meal, etc.). I've had no issue with this attitude, because I get where she's coming from, but it's extremely limiting, annoying, and borderline hypocritical because she will do similar things while working. Also, to add, despite being a new grad hire, I've worked extremely hard and my manager + coworkers have had nothing but positive things to say about my performance.

My final straw came today, when I was in a Teams meeting at work. It was a department-wide call with no pressure to have camera on, no need for me to contribute. I was painting my nails and letting them dry while listening when she knocked on my door and tried to come in with food. I was like ""In a meeting, but thanks"" and tried to get her to shut the door again, but she barged in with the food tray and saw me painting my nails and started to yell at me, saying my ""head isn't on straight"" and how I ""don't understand I won't have a job if I keep acting like this"" and how she ""was slaving away cooking for a child who can't even think straight"".

Now, she's threatening to not give me the car that she promised to give me + not help me out with moving, and I'm pissed because she overreacted once again and is pissed at ME. And the best part? Not even 20 minutes after she yells at me for doing my nails, I can hear the shower turn on in her bathroom during her working hours. But she still insists I'm an asshole and know nothing about the real world. AITA?

36,1f8996w,AITA for continuing to drive around a line of cars waiting for the school bus? ,"I live at the first house on my street, pretty rural road in a pretty rural area. It's a long street but there's enough space between houses to where you can barely see your neighbor's house.

This school year (has never happened previously) parents have started lining up along the right side of the street to wait for the school bus in the mornings, leaving room on the side for cars to pass.

The problem is I leave for work about 5 minutes before the bus gets to my street, so the bus is many streets down, but visibly making it's way towards my street. If I go around the line of cars, parents get mad ""because the bus is right there"" and their kids are actively getting out of the car/running around/being in the street so it makes me feel nervous about it.

The alternative is just waiting in the line of cars for the bus to come then leaving when they all pull out to presumedly go to work.

Some conflicting factors:
-I live in a state where it gets down to -40 in the winter so I get wanting to give your kids a warm car to sit in while waiting for the bus and I have no issue with them being there
-The bus time also varies greatly and is incredibly inconsistent so it's not as simple as ""just leave earlier or later"", the bus schedules are already notoriously all over the place and the time they arrive depends a lot on the weather. With my luck everytime I try to leave earlier or later, they're always earlier or later that day
-My issue is not with the parents lining up at the end of the street, nor with the kids waiting or anything, just that the parents get mad at me for pulling around the line of cars when I can't see a) where the bus is on the main road because of said line of cars and b) when they get mad at me for driving by when all their kids are getting out to get ready to get on the bus and c) if I just wait in the line of cars l'm late to work by a pretty good amount because of the inconsistent bus schedules

I am pretty pregnant and hormonal so it could just be me blowing it out of proportion for no reason, but I am always cautious when it comes to children and I want to make sure I am not being a jerk for no reason.

I told him as long as I am alive, he will always have food and a place to live, but that if he chooses to stay with us he needs to contribute. He could live with us forever for all I care, as long as he is contributing to the family unit. He gets incredibly angry whenever I bring it up saying he doesn't want some BS job and wants to be a video game streamer or some other job that requires minimal work and large pay. Obviously this is crazy talk, but I let him dream because the world is already great at crushing dreams, it doesn't need my help. I told him if he wants to work towards that as a way to make money that's great, but until it actually makes him money, he needs to get a regular job and contribute to our household.

For context my boyfriend (27M) and I (26F) have been going through a rough patch lately. Nothing that was cheating or anything, but he gave me his word on something and didn’t end up upholding that part of it. Needless to say, I was upset but I got over it. Fast forward to last night, I noticed that he has changed his password (we utilize each others phones if the other doesn’t have theirs). I asked him why he did that, he told me because he felt I was going through his phone and wanted to confirm if it was true. He did end up giving me the new passcode, but I was still feeling off. When I asked him why he had thought this , he told me the way I was asking if he had plans made it seem like I knew what he was planning for the week via his text conversations. I did in fact not go through his conversations and had no idea what he was talking about. He eventually told me a girl had tried making plans with him and he thought I noticed it going on his phone even though he never ended up going. When I asked him to see the conversation, he didn’t want to show me, kind of giving me that douchebag demeanor like eye rolling about it. That was enough for me to pack my overnight things and walk out. He told me that this left him shaken up and he lost sleep over it, that he had work the next day and almost called off because of me. AITA for my reaction here or was that justified? 

I might be the asshole in this instance because I didn’t regard the fact that it was late at night and I left abruptly, keeping him up at night when he had to be awake early in the morning for work and I disregarded how he felt in the situation at hand.

41,1f887uw,AITA for being a picky eater? ,"So, I (23F) am a picky eater. I grew up on maybe the same 4 meals and I have unfortunately kept my food repertoire to those same meals + some new ones. I eat spaghetti, tacos, steak, pork chops, salads, pizza.... I mean not terrible but I am definitely picky and I know that. 

  
Furthermore, I am in a new ""relationship"" (not official yet) with a (26M), and we have been seeing each other since the beginning of June. He is super healthy and watches his food intake which is very admirable. I told him I truly wanted to start changing what I eat to better myself because I had needed to for a long time, but I never knew how to start. 

He was super happy to hear this, so we planned a trip to the grocery store and shopped for multiple meals that I could make throughout the week and take to school, (I am a teacher). So, we go to the store and have a good time shopping, then we get back to my apartment and put all the groceries away.

  
We decided to cook spaghetti, which I love, but this time add ground beef for protein. He cooked the meal for me, which I am always appreciative of, and tell him this. Dinner is ready, and we sit down at the table. Basically, I did not like the ground beef in my spaghetti. IDK what is was about it, but I was not into it. 

  
He kind of got pissed at me??? I said ""I'm not a fan of the meat, but it's not terrible,"" He said if I did not finish he would be pissed off. I was like ""what do you mean""??? 

He told me that he does not want to keep making me dinner, skipping his own meals at home so he can eat with me, if I am not going to like or eat what he cooks. It took me by total shock that he said that. I understand its annoying to hear me be so picky, and I ate as much of the food as I could. 

Is this a red flag??? We were pretty quiet after that and obviously both of us were annoyed. We both took showers and got into bed, and I asked him why he acted said that and that it hurt my feelings. He began to reassure me that it will take time to find meals that I like and that it is okay. I said I did not want to inconvenience him and his meal planning/eating times because he did make me feel like an inconvenience. He told me that was not how he meant it... 

But I am still not sure how to feel. Should I continue talking to him?? This is my first potential relationship and he has asked me to be his GF already but I need a little more time. I mean, we are good now and I truly like him and he is really sweet to me. This was the first time I sort of thought negatively about our relationship.

42,1f884pa,AITAH for losing my temper at my partner on a stressful day for them? ,"
My partner (34f) and I (34f) are in another country for my partners work. They were feeling really stressed today because of a work event that's happening tonight. 

We went for a walk and were having a lovely time. At one point I mentioned that they had been on their phone a lot and that I felt shut out. I added that if its because of their anxiety though, it's totally ok and they don't need to stop. My partner said I was accusing them of being on their phone a lot when they weren't, and then tried to prove it by going through their browser or other settings.

This turned into an argument where they were upset that they were being accused of being on their phone a lot, and that I shouldn't have mentioned anything because I knew they were anxious. I was upset that they couldn't connect with my feelings about it. I was feeling kind of sour after this so we took some time to sit apart and not talk while we cooled down. I approached them about five minutes later and asked if they just wanted to drop it and move on. They said yes but we continued arguing. I started to get upset, and then they stood up, interrupted me, and said ""I'm going. I'll see you back at the apartment"". I was really upset, and I'm sure they were too. I waited a few minutes and then started to walk the 20ish minutes back to our apartment. 

We only had one key for the apartment and my partner had it. I assumed by what they said, they were going home. When I was almost there, they called me and said they were not at the apartment and instead sat down along the trail. They said they were waiting for me. I walked along that trail on the way, past the place where my partner apparently was, and we did not see each other. I immediately got angry because I asked them to come with the key. They refused and said I had to go to them. And here is where I lost it. 

Some important context, previously in our relationship I stayed with friends when we were having some issues and crashed on couches. A few times since then, my partner has threatened to kick me out. And even mocked the fact that I was upset at the thought of being made homeless on two separate occasions. 

We argued back and forth, and I said if they were going to stop, they should have let me know straight away. Then they said they text me two minutes after they sat down, even though they said earlier they had been there for fifteen minutes. I said a lot of nasty things. I called them selfish. I told them to fuck off. I said a lot of mean things. I took the keys off them and went back to the apartment. 

A few minutes after I got back, they said they were really overwhelmed and needed me to come meet them. They said it wasn't fair because I was supposed to be supporting them today, and I said I would be there for them. 

I reluctantly got up, met them, and walked home with them. I tried to give them whatever emotional support I could.

43,1f86tlc,AITA for essentially giving up watching my friend's kids?,"Over a month ago, my friend L(F, 33) asked me (F, 24) to watch her kids for 2 weeks while she handles a court case several states away. At the time, the kids were staying with their father for the month of July.



When L asked me to do this favor for her, she explained that the kids (M, 13 and F, 13, not twins) know what needs done around the house and that I would just be observing them, mostly. I agreed because they only live about 30 mins away and I was under the impression I would still be able to go to work and do most things normally.



Then, the kids got back from their dad’s. I’ll spare most of the details but the kids and their dad were essentially missing, staying across town from where they said they’d be, and the cops had to be called in order for L to get the kids back. Then, the boy told the cops he was going to run away as soon as they were back with their mom on the grounds L was abusive. As a result of this, a DCFS case was opened, but quickly closed after an inspection of L’s home because she had nothing to hide.



Fast forward to the week before I’m supposed to watch the kids. L fills me in on everything that happened and warns me that the kids may be a flight risk and that she doesn’t trust them to be alone for any amount of time. As a result of this, she tells me I have to leave work 2 hours early every day so that I can be home when they get back from school. This isn’t ideal because right now is peak season at work, but I get it covered so that I can leave an hour early from work.



The kids whined and fought with me whenever asked to do ANYTHING; chores, getting them to shower, you name it, they wanted to fight. They also would try to fake being sick to get out of going to school and constantly fight with each other.

It's honestly not them, it's me. They are nice, try to be respectful and are genuinely nice people.

I feel 4-5 days is long enough. At least let me know how long they are going to be here for... my wife and her parents seem to think it's fine to just stay indefinitely. We are on day 5 today. I don't know when they are leaving. I don't want to kick them out, but wish they knew not to overstay their welcome.  I tried to ask my wife about what the plan was, and that I wish they would know not to overstay their welcome.  She didn't take it all that well.

My wife is kind and not confrontational. I am the confontational ass hole. Is it unreasonable for me to want to set some boundaries, or at least know of their departure date? I'm sure they'll leave on their own somewhere between 8-10 days. I think that's too long. I just don't like having guests around for that long. They aren't a major inconvenience and maybe I'm just being silly, but just knowing someone is ""on property"" is kind of nerve racking. Not at least knowing WHEN they are leaving kinda drives me nuts.

When I try to gently talk about it with my wife, she gets very defensive and upset that I bring it up. And I don't want to upset her or make her parents feel unwelcome, but I think there are some ""manners"" about atleast letting your host know your plans that they just don't communicate.

I get along good with them. Everything is ""fine""... just miss the peace of mind. Do I just need to hold my nose a few more days and shut up? That's how I've handled it in the past.

First thing is I know this is gonna sound like a lot, but I don’t want the lecture 😅

So after work I have a very set routine (found out I was autistic like a year ago) which involves going to the local. I’ll have 3-4 pints on a weeknight & sometimes more on the weekend. It’s pretty much to just see my mates & has actually been a source of work for weekends on the side so I like to go. Mum mentioned to me that she thinks I’m drinking too much. Her & dad are also down the pub Wed-Sun nights in the other local as well as 8 wine bottles consumed between them every week in the recycling bin.

47,1f86fwt,AITA for asking my neighbor to get a lid for his trashcan?,"My neighbor moved in a little over 2 years ago.  We live in a townhome community, so the houses are attached & we are basically on top of each other.  He keeps his trash cans out on the driveway, up against the wall of the stairs (vs in the garage).  In the beginning, there was a lid for his trash can. Somewhere along the way the lid went missing.  

We live across from the woods, so off & on over the past 2 years I've had to deal with animals knocking over his trash cans, bags being torn open, & food trash spilled all over the place.  Sometimes it happens when the cans are already down at the curb, which doesn't bother me as much.  Other times it happens when his cans are still up by the house.  When this happens, the trash is all over his driveway & spills onto my property (both my front steps & lawn, and driveway depending on how windy it is).

Yesterday, my son & I got home from a long weekend & found a half eaten slice of pizza on the driveway. I felt so irritated so I scooped it up & threw it in the general direction of his property. I sent him a message (there was no car in his driveway so I didn't think anyone was home) nicely asking if he could possibly get a lid for the trash can b/c I kept finding food trash on my property. I explained that last week there was a cup of salad dressing on my steps & ants all over the place, and the half eaten slice of pizza yesterday.  

He responded saying ""I have had a lid on it and the trash man never gave it back and the raccoons keep getting in my trashcan but if you want to say stuff, can you not get grass all over my brand new car you can ask me to move the car. I'm not nitpick, but if you want to nitpick, I can too.""

I felt shocked! I didn't think asking him to put a lid on his trash can was nitpicky - it's common courtesy to contain your trash, isn't it?  I responded to his message saying I wasn't nitpicking, I just didn't want to have to continue cleaning up food trash because it brings bugs.  I also apologized for the grass situation (although when my son cut the grass he was very careful and cleaned it all up - I checked) and said I would ensure the next time my son cuts the grass it would be fully cleaned up.  My last statement in the message was if the trash people took your lid, it's very easy to get another one.

48,1f858pb,AITA for going on holiday with my stepbrother and his friends?,"I (23F) had the opportunity to spend 2 weeks in Italy last month. I haven't had the opportunity to travel much in my life so it was an amazing experience but I think the trip has completely ruined my relationship with my stepbrother (24M).

Before we left I knew he didn't actually want me there. It was his friend, Leo (24M), who actually invited me after I left a comment on one of his posts. When my stepbrother found out he told me I couldn't come but Leo got him to change his mind. We stayed in Leo's family's property which, in hindsight, definitely contributed to my stepbrother backing down and why none of his other friends sided with him.

Leading up to the trip my stepbrother was acting normal but as soon as we got there he was visibly upset with me. He spent the majority of the time following me around and would treat me badly whenever I was spending time with Leo. Leo's cousin (20sF) was also there so I spent most of my time with her as I was trying to give the guys space so I wasn't with Leo or any of his other friends very often but even the slightest interaction with Leo would cause my stepbrother to become angry with me. He was never angry at Leo, though, so I couldn't understand what his issue was.

I did try to see what was wrong while we were there but he would always act like he wasn't angry with me even though he very clearly was. Once we got home he finally let all of his anger out and started yelling at me for inviting myself on his trip. He wanted me to swear I wouldn't ever speak to Leo again or ask him for things. I eventually did because he wouldn't stop yelling at me and he made me unfollow Leo on insta.

Last year my stepsister (22F) and her friend went to Dubai with my stepbrother and his friends. My stepsister invited herself and was partying with them and everything, but my stepbrother had zero issues with that. My stepsister said Leo wants to ""fuck me"" and that's why my stepbrother is so angry because he can't say anything to Leo (she said he's the ""ring leader"" of their group), even if that's the case I don't think it justifies how horrible my stepbrother is acting towards me.

49,1f84yoc,AITA if I ask my partner not play in a D&D game because I’m not invited to play,"I’ve been playing with a D&D group for about four years and invited my partner A to join. Two years ago the DM asked if I was ok taking a break from game for a bit, said it was still in the group and the server but said it seemed like a needed a break. I assumed because I’d had to miss games due to work schedule.

I world to rearrange my work schedule so I’d have time off when games were scheduled and make up lost hours on the weekend or after hours. Then, someone else in the server, I’ll call B posted about wanting to run another game and posted a link to the server we were all in so I clicked and expressed interested.

B then messaged me and told me “To be perfectly honest, I don't feel entirely comfortable with you joining my campaign, especially since this is my first time running a homebrew campaign like this. With how many people are already going to be playing on top of some of the behavior you have exhibited while playing with us in the past, I'm unfortunately going to have to say no to letting you join my campaign.”

This was the first time I learned there were any issues with me this group. When the DM talked to me about taking a break, he specifically said I hadn’t done anything and he wasn’t upset. So I was blindsided. I then learned from B that people had issues with things I’d done but no one told me so I didn’t know.

My partner continued to play the main game and even invited another mutual friend to join. I was really hurt by this. Because people doing things and me being excluded is a trigger. I’m autistic and I was excluded a lot and bullied in middle school. In high school my birth mother abandoned me so I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle who have a daughter a year younger than me and when she had friends over I was told I was to stay in my room and not hang out with her friends. I didn’t go on summer vacations with them. I was left behind got alone while they went out to eat as a family. I was asked to step out so they could get just family photos. At 18 I was forced to move out and not welcomed back. 
My partner continuing to play in the game and inviting another person I thought cared about me really hurt my feelings, because they didn’t care I wasn’t invited and were happy to go have fun without me.  

I hid in the car to cry for hours while partner played game in our studio apartment. I eventually talked to my partner about moving out.

No one shamed her for the fact that they were too scared to be intimate. Then, the two plan a trip together to go see chappell roan and a bunch of other romantic activities.

She even went as far as to tell us a bunch of other little details so we were excited for our friend to finally get to this next step.

52,1f84mdq,AITA for asking my wife to spend all her savings?,"Im a 34 yr old M married to the love of my life a 33 yr old F. My wife is kind, nurturing, and motivated in her career. She does a lot for me at home since i work LONG hours. We married 4 months ago. Dated for 8 yrs.We're both easy going and have the same sense of humor and rarely argue. 

I make 4x more money(I'm in Healthcare) but she makes a good salary as well. Since I make 4x what she does I tend to pay for most things(dinners, weekend trips, mall shopping) which I absolutely do not mind. With bigger purchases we pay for things together in proportion to what we make. she's usually OK with paying her share of things (1/4 of the rent and groceries) and will sometimes offer to pay for dinners and dates.

She's VERY close with her best friends (she has 4).They're great people, But theyre basically attached to the hip and talk daily in a group chat. Which is fine, everyone needs a support system. I have similar friends. 

Her and her 4 friends have a combined savings account together for ""investing in something together"". They've each been putting in a few hundred dollars per month EACH. I've known about this for years and didn't love the idea initially, which I expressed. But she was adamant she wanted this and at the time we weren't hurting for the money and it was ultimately her money and her decision.

She got really upset and told me ""I don't want to touch that money, I promised my friends it would be for investing together, we should look for a less expensive home then, maybe a fixer upper"" she then stated, ""it would be easier for you to accrue the money back since you make so much more.""

This was VERY frustrating and I told her, ""its unfair i have to spend nearly all my savings and you dont. your friend fund is stupid, and it's stupid not to use that money for OUR future home.""

AITA for asking her to use HER OWN cash from her ""friends"" account, break that promise to her friends so we can buy a nice home together? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-03,"AITA for asking my wife to spend all her savings? Im a 34 yr old M married to the love of my life a 33 yr old F. My wife is kind, nurturing, and motivated in her career. She does a lot for me at home since i work LONG hours. We married 4 months ago. Dated for 8 yrs.We're both easy going and have the same sense of humor and rarely argue. 

I make 4x more money(I'm in Healthcare) but she makes a good salary as well. Since I make 4x what she does I tend to pay for most things(dinners, weekend trips, mall shopping) which I absolutely do not mind. With bigger purchases we pay for things together in proportion to what we make. she's usually OK with paying her share of things (1/4 of the rent and groceries) and will sometimes offer to pay for dinners and dates.

She's VERY close with her best friends (she has 4).They're great people, But theyre basically attached to the hip and talk daily in a group chat. Which is fine, everyone needs a support system. I have similar friends. 

Her and her 4 friends have a combined savings account together for ""investing in something together"". They've each been putting in a few hundred dollars per month EACH. I've known about this for years and didn't love the idea initially, which I expressed. But she was adamant she wanted this and at the time we weren't hurting for the money and it was ultimately her money and her decision.

53,1f84jb7,AITA for inviting my nephew to my wedding despite his estrangement from my brother?,"I (33M) am marrying my fiancé (37M) this winter. We’re putting together the guest list to send the invitations out and have run into an issue over my nephew and my brother.

My brother (38M) was 18 when his girlfriend told him she was pregnant. They ended up moving in together and my brother decided to go to find work as a mechanic rather than go to college as he’d planned. My nephew was born a little while later. They got married when she told him she was pregnant with their second kid (15F) and then had two more, both 10M.

Ever since my nephew was born he’s been literally one of my favourite people. I babysat him plenty of times, same with my other niblings, and have spent my twenties as their guncle. My brother and me were close as kids and I’ve been close with his kids as well.

Five years ago my brother found out my nephew wasn't his and his now ex wife had been sleeping with someone else at the time and had suspected my oldest nephew wasn’t my brother’s since he was a little kid. They ended up getting a divorce and my brother didn’t seek custody of my oldest nephew and said he didn’t want to see him. He told me that he needed time to process and would try to patch things up later. That idea was kind of ruined when my nephew turned up at my brother’s apartment begging to talk. It turned into an argument between them.

For context, our father had just passed a couple of months earlier. During the argument my nephew said something along the lines of “No wonder mom fucked somebody else. I bet grandpa hated you.” My brother cut things off then and there and has refused to see my nephew since. I stepped in as the main male figure in my nephew’s life, much as I dislike my ex-SIL. I even took him out for his 18th birthday and took him looking at universities and he now goes to my alma mater.

I asked my brother how he wants to handle the seating situation if they don't want to be close together. My brother was angry I’d even invite my nephew after everything that happened. He said it’d be like inviting my ex-SIL, “he’s not family, he’s just the prick who disrespected our dad.”

I said he’s being petty and childish taking the words of a scared and angry 14-year-old so personally. He was a kid who said something shitty because his entire world was falling apart and the person he’d relied on for his whole life was suddenly pulling away, and instead of being understanding and doing family therapy or something like a grownup my brother decided to give adult weight to a teenager’s words and cut him off completely.

My nephew has said he’s okay with not going if it’s causing an issue, but I told him not to be ridiculous: he’s important to me and I want him there for when I marry my person. I told him he shouldn't let my brother's inability to let go be his problem. My fiance agrees with me. My mom and sister both say I need to see it from my brother’s perspective.

56,1f84ade,AITA for desiring to move out of my mom’s house after constant conflict and emotional abuse? ,"
I (m22) live with my mom (f51) and it is such a burden to live with her. I pay half the rent and I pay electric which is totally okay with me. But it’s the fact that my mom is like an emotional vacuum and she is constantly getting involved in my life and still trying to parent me like I am a child. There are things that I want to do and she will be like “no you can’t do that, you can’t go out” and obviously I don’t listen to her. She is also very manipulative and says that I treat her like an asshole and that I think she’s a bad mom. I’ve told her multiple times that I can’t live with her anymore and that she’s like a huge burden to my life and hindering my future and my freedom. She says that I’m selfish and that I need to think about her too. I told her that I want to live my own life by myself now and that I shouldn’t have to be tied to her.

We used to live in a different apartment that was in a not so good neighborhood but the rent was cheap so I didn’t have any problem. But she was so persistent on trying move out and finding new apartments. I told her I didn’t want to move out but she kept trying to force me. Eventually we got into a new apartment which is a way nicer apartment but the rent is like 2x the cost and the rent is really eating through my finances. We also never used to pay for electric in the old apartment but now we have to pay for electric.

Living with her stresses me out so much plus the fact that I am very unhappy with my job and both of those things gives me so much anxiety. I have gotten so stressed out to the point that I’ve booked a ticket to Puerto Rico for next month so I can move there and quit my job. But my mom would be missing half the rent and needs someone else to move in. She says I’m selfish and that I’m gonna abandon her.

I [49f] have been living on my street for close to 20 years. Yea it may not be the best area or neighborhood but generally everybody is polite and friendly. 

I live in a house. My next door neighbors live in a multifamily house. Maybe with 7 tenants. Ive gotten to know the landlord through the years. Shes a nice woman. Not very talkative but cant complain. 

The landlord, Anne rents out the apartments and she lives in the basement which was a garage. Her bedroom can only fit a twin bed. So a closet. I feel bad but its her life. 

Anyways the real problem is with her son Bryan. He is in his mid 20s now and lives in a shed in their driveway. The shed has no water or plumming. Just a bed and tv. He goes into his mothers apartment for water and plumming.  And hes always had a cat. 

The shed is visible on the street when nobody is parked, so its not like i have to dig to see. His cat is always meowing and clawing at the shed window. Its very small. The size of a small bedroom maybe. 

Bryan moved his girlfriend in the shed and she has 2 cats. So there are 3 cats. Whenever you walk by this summer it smells like cat pee. 

All hours of the night i hear the shed door slam shut. Bryan will walk outside in his underwear. His gf will run with only a towel across the driveway to shower in the apartment. 

There are loud fights. Music. All hours of the night. But most importantly im worried about those cats.

58,1f83m1t,AITA for uninviting my best friend from my birthday party?,"Hi, so the title is from my friends perspective, and the story is from my perspective. Sorry for any mistakes.


I (18 F.) am invited to my best friends 18th bday party. We’ll call her Nat (17 f.). Me and Nat are a part of a nice friendgroup with our other friends, Juli (18 f.) and Nel (19 f.). The problem is Nel’s relationship. She and her bf got together in April 2023 and are still together. I met the guy and he seems alright, but Nel has a habit of prioritizing him and his friends and family over anything else. She plays the perfect daughter in law, and honestly it’s great for her, because they like her a lot. 

The problems start anytime we have plans to go out or do something fun together. We are still in high school but anytime there’s something fun we want to do, everyone tries to find time, except for her. She’s always looking for excuses like „Oh sorry I can’t that day, I’m going to my bf’s house.” Or „Nah, my boyfriends friends are going somewhere and I’m going with them.” Whenever we talk at school she’s always talking about them. She doesn’t even ask us about our lives or doesn’t listen, always chiming in with „oh my boyfriends friend….” And it got to the point where we always listen about them. 

Last time we wanted to go to the beach, she was making excuses (even tho we provided solutions). Another time we wanted to go visit the other town, she didn’t have time for us bc she was with them, like she always is. And now, when the topic of Nat’s birthday comes around, Nel’s saying that she can’t that day, bc her boyfriends parents have their 17th wedding anniversary. Nat’s 18th bday is extremely important to her and she was hoping all 3 of us will celebrate this special day with her. 

We were all super mad at Nel, cuz she’s again prioritizing her boyfriends family over a 4 year friendship. It’s not the first time but we thought that she would celebrate that day with us. Her in-laws aren’t even throwing a party for that anniversary! 

So Nat got understandably hella mad, and she’s usually the calm one, so it came as a surprise to all of us. She told Nel (and I’m quoting): „If you’re choosing them over us again, don’t bother coming. I don’t care anymore, cuz you’re un-invited. I don’t want u there anymore.”

So now Nel is mad at Nat, and me and Juli are mad at Nel. But she thinks she did nothing wrong and is mad at us too. We understand she likes her bf’s family and his friends, but it feels like she’s forgetting about us and doesn’t care anymore.

So, is Nat the Asshole? Are we the assholes for expecting her to be there with us to celebrate Nat’s birthday?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-03,"AITA for uninviting my best friend from my birthday party? Hi, so the title is from my friends perspective, and the story is from my perspective. Sorry for any mistakes.


I (18 F.) am invited to my best friends 18th bday party. We’ll call her Nat (17 f.). Me and Nat are a part of a nice friendgroup with our other friends, Juli (18 f.) and Nel (19 f.). The problem is Nel’s relationship. She and her bf got together in April 2023 and are still together. I met the guy and he seems alright, but Nel has a habit of prioritizing him and his friends and family over anything else. She plays the perfect daughter in law, and honestly it’s great for her, because they like her a lot. 

The problems start anytime we have plans to go out or do something fun together. We are still in high school but anytime there’s something fun we want to do, everyone tries to find time, except for her. She’s always looking for excuses like „Oh sorry I can’t that day, I’m going to my bf’s house.” Or „Nah, my boyfriends friends are going somewhere and I’m going with them.” Whenever we talk at school she’s always talking about them. She doesn’t even ask us about our lives or doesn’t listen, always chiming in with „oh my boyfriends friend….” And it got to the point where we always listen about them. 

Last time we wanted to go to the beach, she was making excuses (even tho we provided solutions). Another time we wanted to go visit the other town, she didn’t have time for us bc she was with them, like she always is. And now, when the topic of Nat’s birthday comes around, Nel’s saying that she can’t that day, bc her boyfriends parents have their 17th wedding anniversary. Nat’s 18th bday is extremely important to her and she was hoping all 3 of us will celebrate this special day with her.

59,1f83h6m,AITA for putting dinner away and playing video games after my girlfriend came home drunk?,"My gf and I live together. I am 29 and she is 26. We’ve lived together for 6 months. I have been very busy at work and with life so yesterday I was really looking forward to cooking dinner for gf and I and relaxing. We had this planned all weekend. My gf is more of a social butterfly than I am so she had plans yesterday morning with her friends. She had brunch at 11 and I was planning on having dinner ready by 630. I expected her to have a few mimosas at breakfast but nothing too crazy. Maybe she’d get home and take a nappy nap before dinner. 

Basically brunch turned into going to one more bar after (around 1 PM). Whichhhh turned into more bars. Which basically became bar hopping all day. She was texting me insisting that she will be home in time for dinner but by the way she was talking I could tell she was drunk. I started making the pasta around 5 pm. Around 530 I saw on her snap story that she was doing shots at a bar in a completely different neighborhood of Chicago. I didn’t want to be the boyfriend who nags so I let it go. I was getting seriously annoyed because I was thinking ohhh great she’s gonna be hammered for our nice night we had planned. 

At 630 she was not home yet. I saw on her location that she was now at a *different* bar from where they were taking shots at. I ate and asked my friends if they wanted to play PlayStation so I packed up the food, put it in the fridge and hopped on PlayStation with the boys. 

Gf arrived home around 715 PM clearly drunk. She asked wtf I was doing and what about dinner. I said she was late, and dinner was done but it’s In the fridge so she can heat some up if she wants. She apologized for being a little bit late but basically gave me a half assed laughing apology saying “you never know what to expect when the girl gang goes to brunch” I said that’s fine but I now have other plans. She called me rude and went to bed. We haven’t talked much about it today but I can tell she is being passive aggressive so am I the asshole?

60,1f834uq,WIBTA for secretly booking a party for my step-son even though his mum doesn’t want me to?,"I’m (33M) currently engaged to my fiancée (30F), and we’re blending our families together. I have a son (9M), and she has a son (11M). My son is turning 10 soon, and we’re planning a big birthday celebration for him. This is a tough time of year for us because his mum passed away on his 5th birthday, so I’ve always tried to make it a day filled with happy memories rather than sad ones.

My son has his heart set on renting out a cinema screen to play on his Switch with his friends. It’s a bit extravagant, but it’s something our local cinema offers. He also wants a VR headset and a new iPad, along with a nice birthday meal. I know it’s a lot, but I can afford it, and it’s the one time of year I really go all out for him.

The issue is, my fiancée isn’t happy about it. She makes minimum wage, and although she’s moved into my home (which I own outright, thanks to my grandfather leaving it to me), she doesn’t contribute to the household finances or bills. I cover everything, including groceries, which go on my credit card and I pay off at the end of the month. We’ve kept our finances separate, and she originally offered to pay rent, but I refused because I didn’t think it was necessary.

Here’s where it gets tricky. My fiancée is upset because she can’t afford to give her son an equal birthday party. I offered to pay for her son to have a party that’s just as special as the one I’m planning for my son, but she refused. She feels like it’s something she should be able to do for him on her own, and I completely understand that. However, I don’t want my step-son to feel left out or like he’s less important, so I’m thinking about secretly booking a party for him anyway. So I was considering booking a party (of equal value but something my step-son wants) but telling him to keep it secret from his mum until the day. In my head, this would be romatic and show that I cared about him. I would tell my fiancée that I would sort out the party but stick to her budget, so there wasn't something booked twice. But secretly let her son pick whatever he wants and give him the same budget I did my son.

A close friend of mine (who happens to be female) thinks this is a terrible idea. She believes that if I go behind my fiancée’s back, it’ll just make her feel worse about not being able to provide for her son and might cause tension between us. She’s warned me that it could come across as me undermining her role as a mother and that I should just leave it alone after offering.

66,1f81vwa,AITA for telling my roommate to stop complaining to me?,"Hi everyone. I don't know if I'm in the wrong here, so let me explain the situation.

My roommate ""Ben"" (30M) and I (28F) live in an apartment building. We have an upstairs neighbour whose balcony is right above where Ben works remotely at his desk. Our neighbour has a very loud voice, and often takes calls on said balcony. It bleeds into the room and Ben hates it - particularly in the warmer months when we have the windows open.

Whenever it happens, Ben comes to me and complains about it, saying he wants to tell the neighbour to be quieter. When I say he should if it's bothering him he does not - just continues complaining about it. It's happened a handful of times now, and it really gets on my nerves. A few days ago it happened again, Ben once again came to me and complained about it. I kind of reached the end of my tether and calmly asked that if he had a problem with the neighbour he should go to him, and stop complaining about it to me. Ben stood there for a few minutes in silence then told me I was overreacting, and left the room.

Things since then have been okay, but awkward. At this point maybe I should just go to the neighbour, but it isn't my problem and I don't know why Ben can't do that, or if he isn't going to then keep it to himself. I understand venting and I'm not saying I don't want my friend to be able to talk to me, but it's the same complaint over and over without him ever taking steps to address it.

My roommate ""Ben"" (30M) and I (28F) live in an apartment building. We have an upstairs neighbour whose balcony is right above where Ben works remotely at his desk. Our neighbour has a very loud voice, and often takes calls on said balcony. It bleeds into the room and Ben hates it - particularly in the warmer months when we have the windows open.

Whenever it happens, Ben comes to me and complains about it, saying he wants to tell the neighbour to be quieter. When I say he should if it's bothering him he does not - just continues complaining about it. It's happened a handful of times now, and it really gets on my nerves. A few days ago it happened again, Ben once again came to me and complained about it. I kind of reached the end of my tether and calmly asked that if he had a problem with the neighbour he should go to him, and stop complaining about it to me. Ben stood there for a few minutes in silence then told me I was overreacting, and left the room.

Things since then have been okay, but awkward. At this point maybe I should just go to the neighbour, but it isn't my problem and I don't know why Ben can't do that, or if he isn't going to then keep it to himself. I understand venting and I'm not saying I don't want my friend to be able to talk to me, but it's the same complaint over and over without him ever taking steps to address it. If I'm in the wrong and overreacted, I'd love to know. Thanks all.",0.0,0.021697726100683212,0,1

She went away for two months and during that time we didn't text as much (something that did not bother me tbh, I could tell she was having fun based on the stories she kept on posting on Instagram and I was happy for her).

She came back two weeks ago.

Fast-forward to Friday, another close friend of mine, had planned a small get together at her place and had only invited her close friends (A was not included), keep in mind that, this event had been planned for weeks. 

A finds out and gets mad at me, as if I had any say in who got invited.

Fast-forward to Saturday, I had also planned on going to the beach at night with a small group of friends. 

The plan wasn't set in stone because we hadn't decided on where we were going. 

Nonetheless, I told A and invited her to join but insisted that the plan wasn't 100% confirmed.  She told me that she was already planning on going to the beach during the day and that she will see whether or not she would want to join. I had sent her texts during the day that went unanswered (she probably didn't have reception).

Anyway, we ended up choosing the place we wanted to go to at 7PM and we went at 8PM, I forgot to tell A that we ended up deciding on going to the beach (that was bad on my part and I admit it). We get there and she sends me a text 8:30pm saying: ""Did you go to the beach or not, if not let's get a drink"", I replied to her saying that we did go and that we had just arrived not too long ago. She then sends me a voice-note, saying how if I didn't want her to be there to just say so and that I was an asshole for not letting her know we went.

Keep in mind that we had decided on meeting up on Sunday to spend the day together (which never happened).

I admit I have a lot of friends and that I should reserve more time for her, but these were pre-defined plans, that were made when she was away. She also hadn't texted me the whole week nor told me she wanted to go out on the WE.

I ended up apologizing (as I always do) and promised her to make more time for her (which I mean because I do care about her).

She has yet to reply to my messages and I honestly am tired of reaching out.

68,1f819cl,AITA for inspiring the bridal party to eat at a fast food place?,"I 26m apologize for any mistakes, English isn't my first language.

This Saturday we were invited to our friends wedding and we were part of the bridal party. I was a groomsmen and my girlfriend Ali was a bridesmaid.

We had breakfast and I drove Ali to her preparations and then I went to the groom. We went to pick up the bride around 11 with all the ceremonies. Then was the first photoshot. The wedding was between 1 and 2, and we had the park and beach photoshot. The normal guests had the time to have lunch but we didn't. The civil ceremonies was between 4 and 5, there was that last photoshot with all the, almost 200, guest. There was a cocktail reception for an hour were everyone got one profiterol and a glass of champagne(with half a grape, this was a expensive hotel and they couldn't even put in a whole grape). 

Dinner started at 7 and it was a joke. We were served a courses every hour. The salad - 2 slices of tomato, whipped cheese balls on top, with 2 crescent of red onion and 3 cucumber matchstick, and 2 small cheese balls with some sort of nuts. Soup - exactly 9 spoonfulls of cucumber soup, maybe 10 if you scrape the sides. Main - a palmsized piece of stake(it was delicious) with baby corn(it was bad) and whipped bell peppers??(inedible). Cheese board - 5 kinds of cured meats and 4 kind of cheeses with 3 pieces of each. Our table has 12 people.

We couldn't leave before midnight because it would be rude and the camera men were booked until then.

During the whole ""dinner"" we were expecting to perform our duties and participate in everything, games or dances. During one of our many breaks for fresh air, I noticed an open doner place and made a joke about going there if we had money. Then Ali did the most amazing thing, she took of her shoe and pulled out a 50 from under the sole. I have never loved her more. We sneaked away and ate fast so we wouldn't be missed. But we didn't think that we would smell like garlic and meat. After looking at us for a while one of the bridesmaid asked were we got the food and we answered honestly. The entire table slowly left to get food.

Our entire table was empty when it came time for the cake cutting, even the bestman  and maid of honor were missing. We lied that one of the girls had stomach problems. While Ali was calming down the bride I ran to call the wedding party. The bride was really mad because the cake cutting was postponed for 15 minutes, but everything else seemed normal. We stayed until 1 and went to our hotel.

We didn't hear anything Sunday, but yesterday Ali reserve a call from the bride and she was angry. She said that we had insulted her wedding and made people leave on purpose to humiliate her. That she was a traitor and a backstabber. Ali was very sad so I tried talking with the groom, but he said to wait and that it wasn't yet the time to apologize.

Or, I shared concerns about my father (65) (mental health and manipulative issues), she laughed it off and did not show support. So I took distance from her.

For once I bursted and asked her how was it obvious? That I was not following her life, and maybe I was not okay and facing difficulties? (no insults). She was shocked, answered ""oh come on I did not know you had problems"" and just stopped talking to me, so did I.  
Today I’d handle it differently.

5 years after, my friends A&H (70) advised me to ask help to my family (I needed a car) and that it was an opportunity to reconnect. I called my aunt who told me that ""they were not sure they'd still know me"", that ""I had cut contact with them"", that they saw G ""in tears"" after that I ""told her to get lost"", they ""did not understand"" and ESPECIALLY that my dad was ""super sad"" because of my behaviour towards him.

I asked if we could eventually plan a day to call each other, to which she answered something like ""call me on the evenings eventually but it depends, you can always try"".

But then during those weak moments at night, she’d tell me “ur still my gf”. Like she wants it both ways
This past week she had been having anxiety because I wasn’t really speaking to her,  so she reached out &I gave in (I know).

Then she has a skirt that’s meant for beach/pool day & she’s posing standing while lifting the skirt slit exposing her upper thigh, in a suggestive way.

72,1f80otn,AITA for telling my sister she's not really the kind of mom she says/thinks she is?,"My sister, we'll call Kimantha (40s) is much older than me (mid 20s). Kimantha is a mom and it's her whole personality. She constantly posts on social media that her home is open to any kid who might not feel like they have a place to go. She gets REAL into it and every 5th or so post is one of those memes about being the ""cool"" place to crash. Or that she wants to be the house where all the kids can just walk in and grab a soda. She has her kids' friends call her Momma K. Whatever.

Recently we were talking on the phone and she cursed and said, ""Not again,"" and said she had to be quiet so no one knew she was home. She then ranted about her neighbors who yell and scream all the time, and their daughter who we'll call ""Annabell"" (7). I guess Annabell and Kimantha's daughter ""Petal"" (8) are friends. Annabell comes over every day (or tries to), rings the bell and sits on the porch if they aren't home, etc. Kimantha said when Annabell comes over she's always asking for food and Kimantha feeds her most days. Kimantha said that Annabell's older sister ""Betty (15?)"" refuses to go in the house when the Dad is home (she will even sleep on their porch!). To me, this screams that these girls are at the very least food insecure,  likely neglected, and possibly abused.

Kimantha said that she was just done dealing with someone else's kid. I laughed and said, ""Ha, so much for all those Facebook posts, eh?"" Oh...was she pissed. She asked me what I meant and I said that she posts about being the ""cool mom"" and the place all the neighborhood kids could crash but then when someone actually seems to need that safe place...she's hiding in her bathroom and pretending she's not at home. I said that I guess she's not really the kind of mom she says she is.

She. Went. Mental. Screaming at me about how I don't know anything. Granted, Kimantha said that she'd be fine with it if the girl didn't ""bully"" Petal in school. I asked her what Annabell had done to bully Petal, and she said that occasionally Annabell doesn't sit with Petal at lunch and one time kicked mulch at her during recess. To me, these didn't sound like bullying but like, typical playground conflicts...and frankly a pretty weak excuse and I told her so.

Anyway, Kimantha isn't talking to me currently and keeps sending me hateful texts about not knowing anything about kids. While I 100% don't think she's RESPONSIBLE for dealing with Annabell, I do think she's being an asshole for saying she's ""that kind of mom"" online, but then...not actually doing it when it's happening in real life? So...AITA? >!​!<

  
Edit: I did ask during the call if she had called CPS on the parents. Kimantha said she doesn't have enough evidence to make a report. I told her that sleeping outside rather than inside because the dad was home WAS evidence and she told me to shut up and not tell her what to do. I also live 3 states away and don't know any of the addresses or even the streets that Betty/Annabelle live off of so I don't actually think I CAN call CPS as all I have is a 3rd hand conversation as evidence and no specific location.

She has her kids' friends call her Momma K. Whatever.

Recently we were talking on the phone and she cursed and said, ""Not again,"" and said she had to be quiet so no one knew she was home. She then ranted about her neighbors who yell and scream all the time, and their daughter who we'll call ""Annabell"" (7). I guess Annabell and Kimantha's daughter ""Petal"" (8) are friends. Annabell comes over every day (or tries to), rings the bell and sits on the porch if they aren't home, etc. Kimantha said when Annabell comes over she's always asking for food and Kimantha feeds her most days. Kimantha said that Annabell's older sister ""Betty (15?)"" refuses to go in the house when the Dad is home (she will even sleep on their porch!). To me, this screams that these girls are at the very least food insecure,  likely neglected, and possibly abused.

Kimantha said that she was just done dealing with someone else's kid. I laughed and said, ""Ha, so much for all those Facebook posts, eh?"" Oh...was she pissed. She asked me what I meant and I said that she posts about being the ""cool mom"" and the place all the neighborhood kids could crash but then when someone actually seems to need that safe place...she's hiding in her bathroom and pretending she's not at home. I said that I guess she's not really the kind of mom she says she is.

She. Went. Mental. Screaming at me about how I don't know anything. Granted, Kimantha said that she'd be fine with it if the girl didn't ""bully"" Petal in school. I asked her what Annabell had done to bully Petal, and she said that occasionally Annabell doesn't sit with Petal at lunch and one time kicked mulch at her during recess. To me, these didn't sound like bullying but like, typical playground conflicts...and frankly a pretty weak excuse and I told her so.

Anyway, Kimantha isn't talking to me currently and keeps sending me hateful texts about not knowing anything about kids. While I 100% don't think she's RESPONSIBLE for dealing with Annabell, I do think she's being an asshole for saying she's ""that kind of mom"" online, but then...not actually doing it when it's happening in real life? So...AITA? >!​!<

  
Edit: I did ask during the call if she had called CPS on the parents. Kimantha said she doesn't have enough evidence to make a report. I told her that sleeping outside rather than inside because the dad was home WAS evidence and she told me to shut up and not tell her what to do. I also live 3 states away and don't know any of the addresses or even the streets that Betty/Annabelle live off of so I don't actually think I CAN call CPS as all I have is a 3rd hand conversation as evidence and no specific location.

73,1f80948,AITA for telling my sister she can’t use our disabled mums money to buy more holiday from work?,"Me (M35) and my sister (F40) have power of attourney for financial affairs and welfare over our mum.  Mum has not got the mental capacity to deal with her own affairs due to cognitive decline.  She has been in a residential care setting g for around a year. 

My sister recently told my wife that she planned to take around £1,000 from mums account and use it both buy paid time off from her job because she is stressed by mums illness. 

To be honest, out of the 4 of us siblings, she maybe has done the most legwork getting her into a home and dealing with carers.  This was her choice and because she is controlling.  

An example of how controlling she is-  last month mum had a fall, and the home tried to call my sister as she is first on the contact list. 

The second person on the contact list should be me or one of my siblings, but she has tried to exclude us from mums care to the extent she had our dad listed as the next contact.  They hate each other and have not spoken since they divorced around 30 years ago. 

Anyway, over a family dinner recently, my sister said she intended to buy annual leave with Mums money.  Myself and one of my siblings said no to this, and if she used the money that would be needed for mums future care on buying additional holiday, it would not be in my mums best interest, and she would be reported for financial abuse of mums money.  

To clarify, she gets around 28 days a year of annual leave and her boss has also given her compassionate leave when she has requested it.

She has done more caring than the rest of us because she chooses to and lives nearby.  Everyone else does offer to do more but she doesn’t let anyone else help out. Since mum has been in the home we visit an equal amount, and so for the past year the division of Labour has been about the same.

74,1f8013m,AITA for misunderstanding fight time and missing my flight,"
So… i live abroad and am back in India for a few weeks and i genuinely wanted to take my mom and dad on an international trip… 
So i planned to take them to vietnam and got the visas; visa approved for us, booked the flights…

Then my dad had some health issue and he couldn’t join is, as me and my mom couldn’t go by ourselves i filed visa for my brother and booked his tickets..

So ever since the plan for the trip… we(me, mom and brother) have been having countless arguments with our dad… faced a lot of difficulties while booking this trip as this has been the most stressful time for me as i am recently diagnosed with ADHD. 
So i faced difficulties like :

1.) Everyday mental abuse by my father 
2.) My dad cancelling himself and had to file everything new for my brother
3.) Got scammed by the airbnb host in Mumbai
4.) i have 2 pet dogs.. so 1 dog attacked the other severely just 2 days before the flight date..which never used to happen.


I have been to multiple countries and planned everything by myself. 

So fast forward to yesterday, on the flight ticket the date shows 3rd September 00:40.
In my brain all this time i thought it was the midnight of 3rd September… in reality i have to be on the airport on 2nd September.. and then from my city it takes around 10-11hrs (with traffic) to reach Mumbai… as i did the we checkin i saw the boarding time and the ground slipped off my feet… it was 2nd September 23:00… i told my mom about this and i was panicking that we cant reach there with whatever means possible… the next flights costed 30k inr for 1 person where as originally before i hit pay the airlines showed me 8k inr for 1 person 
The prices got tripled… 
Because of this we had to cancel the entire trip… 


To make the damage control, i booked new flight tickets form Mumbai to ho chi minh city.. as our first tickets were from Mumbai to Hanoi, 
In the vietnam e visa i had to compulsory mention my entry port and i put it as Hanoi.. so researching a bit i found out that i only have to enter through the port i mentioned in my evisa…

If i take the risk of flying my younger brother and my
Mom and they deny my entry it will cause a lot of problems… 

So finally decided to cancel the trip..i feel so guilty about all this as my mom and brother never even said anything to me… about my mistake… they just forgave me.. ",Asshole,2024-09-03,"AITA for misunderstanding fight time and missing my flight

76,1f7z79t,AITA for telling my older sister she can’t move her clothes into my wardrobe?,"I’m abt to go into uni and I’ll be living with my sister in an apartment. I have two older sisters and one of them (I’ll call Sam) moved out (Sam was the one who originally found the apartment and was living there with two other roommates). So my other sister (let’s call her Ally) moved in with her a few yrs ago and they shared room with two wardrobes. Ally had a smaller wardrobe which she broke so she bought another one which is pretty cheap in quality and is more of a storage unit than a unit for clothes, so that thing is falling apart. Sam and her partner had even said to her that it wasn’t good and that she should buy one to replace the one that came with the place, but Ally didn’t care. Sam owned the bigger wardrobe which is good quality and came with the apartment 

Me and Sam had an agreement before she moved out that I would take her wardrobe and space. So the only readjustment would be for me when moving. But now that Sam has moved out Ally has decided that she wants to move all her stuff into Sam’s old closet without my knowledge, so in turn I would take her crappy storage unit. 

Unfortunately I had to find out this information through Sam who found out when visiting Ally that she threw all of Sam’s clothes into a black bag and put her own clothes in Sam’s closet (which is now supposed to be mine). Ofc Sam was not pleased with this, but this selfish behaviour isn’t new for Ally, so Sam didn’t start an argument and relayed the message to me. 

My mom was supposed to go and visit Ally to help make space for me when I’m moving up this week but Ally refused (we had called her). Ally had said that she’d already arranged the room and the wardrobe so my mom asked which closet and she says ‘Sam’s closet’. 

So I was like aw hell nahh and said ‘that’s my closet, Sam gave it to me’ and ofc she said ‘Sam’s not living here anymore’ but I said that ‘we established this before she moved or even had a place and I’m not dealing with your BS closet’ and since she’s older and in my culture respecting your elders is highly regarded so she said ‘IM OLDER RESPECT YOUR ELDERS’ like what abt respecting me! She then says I need to be working on my end of schools exams which will determine what college I go to. These exams took place two months ago

This girl was being so dismissive saying ‘mother can we talk later I’m tired’ (cuz my mom had originally wanted to discuss visiting her and she used my phone to call). 

How is she going to preach abt respect when she can’t even respect the person she’s going to be sharing a room with. Me and Sam had an agreement and now she’s trying to get in between it and this girl says she studying law and she can’t even respect an agreement that doesn’t involve her. 

I wasn’t having that so I simply said she either gives me the closet or she buys me a new one simple as ‘a’ ‘b’ ‘c’

79,1f7yo7z,AITA for inviting my best mate who is also my fiancées sisters ex to our wedding? ,"
So, I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and could really use some outside perspective. I’m getting married soon, and naturally, I want my best mate there. The problem? My best mate also happens to be my fiancée’s sister’s ex-boyfriend. They broke up at the start of this year, and she was the one who ended it. Things have been pretty tense since then.

To add more context, there’s some history here. My mate has a bit of a reputation… he has disrupted past events and had arguments  with my future father-in-law. It wasn’t a good look, but he’s still a close friend.

Now, my fiancée and her sister are absolutely against the idea of inviting him to our wedding. They don’t want any drama, and I totally get that. But on the other hand, he’s been a solid friend to me, and I want him there on my big day.

I’ve tried to explain that he’s important to me, but they’re not budging. Despite everything, I’m still leaning toward inviting him because he’s my best mate. But now I’m wondering—am I the asshole for insisting on inviting him, knowing the history and how uncomfortable it makes my fiancée and her sister?

So, I’m in a bit of a tricky situation and could really use some outside perspective. I’m getting married soon, and naturally, I want my best mate there. The problem? My best mate also happens to be my fiancée’s sister’s ex-boyfriend. They broke up at the start of this year, and she was the one who ended it. Things have been pretty tense since then.

To add more context, there’s some history here. My mate has a bit of a reputation… he has disrupted past events and had arguments  with my future father-in-law. It wasn’t a good look, but he’s still a close friend.

Now, my fiancée and her sister are absolutely against the idea of inviting him to our wedding. They don’t want any drama, and I totally get that. But on the other hand, he’s been a solid friend to me, and I want him there on my big day.

I’ve tried to explain that he’s important to me, but they’re not budging. Despite everything, I’m still leaning toward inviting him because he’s my best mate. But now I’m wondering—am I the asshole for insisting on inviting him, knowing the history and how uncomfortable it makes my fiancée and her sister? 


Also, if I were to not invite him, how do I even go about that? I’m worried that not inviting him could seriously damage our friendship, and I’m not sure how to handle it. Would really appreciate any advice.

my dad sends me 1/6 of his salary as student assistance and this is quite good money, and my mom does not really allow me to spend it, because she wants to potentially use it to pay off this large loan. she yelled at me when I secretly spent part of it on a visit to a psychiatrist (I was really bad and I thought about not living anymore) and criticized my spending. she earns well and copes for now, but her control over money irritates me. I just don't understand why I should give money that was meant for me to resolve a situation that I had no part in, given that I'm still a student and can't earn a full-time living.

82,1f7xyeo,AITA for yelling at my friend for not taking care of our puppy?,"My BF and I were invited for a wedding a couple of hours driving away from our place. It was this past Saturday, and we planned to be away from Friday to Sunday.

We have a tiny 11mo puppy. She was very sick during her first months of life which delayed everything for her. It's being only a couple of months since we were finally able to take her outside, and she's still learning to potty outside (with great progress and only a few accidents).

We needed someone to take care of her during these days. A very close friend of us who loves dogs asked to stay over our place for 3 weeks (she's currently living abroad), coincidentally during the days we would be off. We asked her if she could take care of the puppy and she promptly agreed. We were happy that someone close would be in our place with her, and could follow our tidy routine.

One thing to point out is that this friend is very needy. Last year she stayed over our place and she would not leave us for her entirely stay. To the point we had to asked her for a few hours alone so we could have some intimacy.

So she arrives here two weeks ago. During all these days she stayed very close to us. We were already fed up, but as she would take care of our puppy, and we would have our days off soon, we didn't mind that much. We left last Friday and left all the instructions, timings, activities, and everything we expected her to do with the puppy. She  agreed on everything.

She hung up, told me I didn't have to talk to her that way, and that she would be leaving our house. I told her to f off.

We arrived late that night, I didn't even see her. Got the puppy and went straight to our room. Sunday morning she was gone. Didn't see nor talked to her since.

84,1f7xrz8,AITA for telling a former friend of mine she was being judgmental? ,"Using a throw way account.

I've been friends with someone, let's call her Abby, for around 15 years. As long as we've known each other, I've known she was a Pagan, and she knew I was Christian and discussing religion was fun for both of us and I love hearing and learning about other people's religions and belief systems. I've always been a pretty liberal Christian and support LGBTQIA rights and other left leaning beliefs (this will become important later).

Recently, she has become very zealous about her beliefs, which I never minded. Though often she would switch between saying she's Pagan, Wiccan, or even an atheist. Once, Abby said she was a Pagan Atheist (correct me if I'm wrong, I took that as meaning if a religion was real or gods did exist, it would be some form of Paganism. I heard someone say they were a Christian atheist and that was their definition, so I'm assuming that's what Abby meant).

Anyway, she started going on about how Christians are judgmental and hypocritical. On Facebook, someone posted something she didn't like, and her response was essentially, ""That sounds like a rather Christian thing to say and we're better than them, so don't say that."" (The person she was talking to was another Pagan).

One another page which we are both part of she posted something about religion, and I responded asking for clarification because I wasn't sure what her beliefs were. (I can't remember or find the post, but I know I said something along the lines of ""someone who is Pagan/Wiccan/Atheist). To which she sent a rather rude response back saying I was stupid because those are three separate things and not the same.

(What I meant was that she often switches between the three and I wasn't sure how she currently identified, which was my fault. I should have rephrased what I said to make it clearer what I meant, and I can understand why she was turned off by how I phrased it).

Anyway, she said something along the lines of that she wasn't going to listen to someone who was homophobic. (The conversation had nothing to do with LGBT related topics and Abby is a straight cis woman and knows that I support LGBT rights.)

  
I private messaged her, apologizing for if I made her think I was homophobic or intolerant for anyway and asking to know what I said or did, so I make it better. She her response was to say it was how all Christians were.

I got more annoyed than I should have, and said that was rather judgmental and hypocritical of her. She grew mad, called me rude and said I was bullying her and blocked me.

86,1f7x52u,WIBTA for excluding 1 person from our group friends in my wedding,"Me (28y.o. Male) and my fiance (28y.o. AKA Lara) are planning on doing a small-medium intimate wedding next year with our family and a few select friends.  
I have been contemplating lately as  
to whether i should invite an old friend (AKA Jen) to our wedding. Normally, i wouldn’t  
care whether she would get offended or not, and my fiancé isn’t also very fond  
of her. However, I am thinking of inviting Jen’s younger brother (AKA Rico) and  
his GF (AKA Deb) to my wedding. But I can sense that that might cause an issue/drama.

Here’s the backstory:

I have been friends with Jen, Rico, and Deb for 12+ years since high school. There was some time during those years where I considered them to be my top 5 friends. Unfortunately, my connection with them started to diminish about 4 yrs ago due to internal conflicts within our group friends. However, I was able to maintain my friendship with Rico because we occasionally play online games together, and even though I haven’t talk to Deb as much as I used to, there has never been some bad blood between us.  
It wasn’t until 3 yrs ago when i started dating my GF Lara (soon to be wife) that my friendship with Jen started to deteriorate.

In 2020, Lara started to become a part of our group friend, FYI Lara was dating someone else at that time. When Lara became single (aprox. end of 2020) I immediately started to court her; however, Lara immediately rejected me as she felt that she still needs to time to recover, which I respected. So, I decided to see other people and so does Lara.  
When Jen learned that I liked Lara; Jen started telling me about Lara’s previous relationship (Jen was friends with Lara’s ex) even though I never really asked her to tell me about it (inferring that Lara was unfaithful to their relationship as they were on LDR). Even though Lara rejected me initially, I still tried to maintain a base of friendship with her since were in the same circle of friends. Which is why I know that she has never been unfaithful to her past relationship. I know this because, she was new to the country at the time and her cousin is my best friend and I frequently hangout at their place (they live in the same house). Before Lara broke up with her ex. She is either working (to send money to her parents) or studying. While im seeing someone else. The reason why I am telling this, is because in 2023, Jen made a remark on social media implying that I stole Lara from her ex, and that I was the cause of the break their up. I got disappointed with Jen, and because of this I stopped talking to her. I really valued our friendship. The worst part is she never apologized to me or my fiancé, and she is acting like nothing happened.  
In the end I decided to forgive her about it, because a great lyricist once said

87,1f7x420,AITAH for asking to go to an event my boyfriend’s friends held and having a breakdown when they flat out refused?,"EDITED to remove irrelevent info as advised and add requested context:

My boyfriend Steven (31m) and I (29f) have been dating for about a year. Steven and his sister Rowan (28f) are friends with a couple Lily(34F) and Jared(36M) who they play D&D and board games with. Since dating Steven, I've met them a few times and joined in their dinners.

Recently, they planned a game night and only invited Steven and Rowan. I work irregular hours (nights, schedule changes every couple of weeks) and only have one weekend day off a week, which is typically when Steven and I get to spend time together, and they scheduled for that night. It was fairly last minute I felt hurt and confused about not being invited because, in my experience, partners are usually included in social events, and I’ve always done the same for others.

Also, I'm an avid gamer: ttrpgs, boardgames, etc. And Steven and Rowan were thinking of taking my copy of a brand new game I'd bought recently to play with. But I don't know for sure that Lily and her husband knew it was my game.

I told Steven how I felt, explaining that I was stressed from work (Emergency response type role and it was a rough week) and didn’t want to spend the night alone. He spoke with Lily, who said they only wanted the two siblings because it was a four-person game. Steven then put me on the phone with Lily, and pushed me to tell her about my mental health struggle and why I wanted to come even if I just watch, so I did, even though Im an extremely private person and never allow vulnerability outside of close relationships. She said she sympathised but still refused and suggested I find other coping mechanisms, like using a weighted blanket, instead of relying on Steven for support.

I ended the call feeling vulnerable and very upset, and had a meltdown (ADHD emotional overload, NOT a tantrum, I did not yell or demand anything) afterward. I told Steven I didn’t want to visit Lily and her husband again as I am obviously not welcome, but I encouraged him (without any passive aggressiveness) to go and enjoy himself. I didn’t want to appear clingy and keep him from his friends, even though I was struggling emotionally.

With their explanations about wanting 4 people, and that I'd be bored, I’m questioning whether I overreacted. I see them thinking he should have activities without me, and not knowing that he does. I have never asked him to cancel any plans for me before. This was not a common occurence.

I've been spiraling with all sorts of thoughts as to why they didnt want me: worried that they hate me, or that they don't accept me as his gf. I also wonder if my stress and ADHD rejection sensitivity influenced my reaction.

AITAH for asking to come even though I wasn't invited and then reacting so strongly to a refusal that I will not see them again?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-03,"AITAH for asking to go to an event my boyfriend’s friends held and having a breakdown when they flat out refused? EDITED to remove irrelevent info as advised and add requested context:

My boyfriend Steven (31m) and I (29f) have been dating for about a year. Steven and his sister Rowan (28f) are friends with a couple Lily(34F) and Jared(36M) who they play D&D and board games with. Since dating Steven, I've met them a few times and joined in their dinners.

Recently, they planned a game night and only invited Steven and Rowan. I work irregular hours (nights, schedule changes every couple of weeks) and only have one weekend day off a week, which is typically when Steven and I get to spend time together, and they scheduled for that night. It was fairly last minute I felt hurt and confused about not being invited because, in my experience, partners are usually included in social events, and I’ve always done the same for others.

Also, I'm an avid gamer: ttrpgs, boardgames, etc. And Steven and Rowan were thinking of taking my copy of a brand new game I'd bought recently to play with. But I don't know for sure that Lily and her husband knew it was my game.

I told Steven how I felt, explaining that I was stressed from work (Emergency response type role and it was a rough week) and didn’t want to spend the night alone. He spoke with Lily, who said they only wanted the two siblings because it was a four-person game. Steven then put me on the phone with Lily, and pushed me to tell her about my mental health struggle and why I wanted to come even if I just watch, so I did, even though Im an extremely private person and never allow vulnerability outside of close relationships. She said she sympathised but still refused and suggested I find other coping mechanisms, like using a weighted blanket, instead of relying on Steven for support.

I ended the call feeling vulnerable and very upset, and had a meltdown (ADHD emotional overload, NOT a tantrum, I did not yell or demand anything) afterward. I told Steven I didn’t want to visit Lily and her husband again as I am obviously not welcome, but I encouraged him (without any passive aggressiveness) to go and enjoy himself. I didn’t want to appear clingy and keep him from his friends, even though I was struggling emotionally.

88,1f7wn0b,AITA for refusing to sit at the back?,"So I (17F) am in my final year of highschool. I don't have hearing problems, my ears work just fine, but I am easily distracted and I can daydream very easily. So despite being tall, I like to sit at the front so I can concentrate more easily on what the teacher say. Moreover, some of my classmates don't really care about the classes, so they can get very noisy, which again, I am easily distracted by. However, I like to pay attention in class bc this way I have to study less at home, I learn best through audio and this is my final year so even those classes I am not really interested in, I have to get a good score to secure a spot in the top universities of my country.

In our school, on the first day of school, when people come in and sit somewhere in our classroom (teachers come and go, students remain), they usually sit there for the rest of the year. However, due to changing interests/friendships, it happens that some people change their seating mid-semester.

We have double tables, meaning two students sit beside a shared table.The first day is dedicated to safety revisions and general things, and I sat in the back for I didn't know where were unoccupied seats. However, even in that short day, my classmated managed to disctract me which I would not like to continue.

Today, there were 2 available seats. One at the very back where I sat yesterday, and one in the very front, next to a girl named Cathy (17f). Cathy is generally alone, since no one likes her much; this has been for the past 3 years. She's a bit arrogant, unkind and she isn't willing to share her notes by photocopy or do anything of the kind. She also misses a lot of classes. She isn't here for the first 2 classes, then randomly comes in for the next, then disappears for one again before coming back. That is not for a medical condition. She's perfectly polite to everyone, but simply she's not the kind most people would like to assosiate themselves with.

When today she came in (3 hours after the first class), she found me sitting in the seat next to her. She asked me to sit back, but I refused and explained that I don't like to sit in the back bc of my problem with hearing the teacher. She said that it doesn't work like this and since I sat there not even 24 hours after we first occupy the seats, I should not sit there. That I should've sat there yesterday. I refused vehemently again, and she replied that her bag needs the space and when I pointed out that she can keep it on the other side, where everyone else keeps it, she replied that her bag cannot be kept there. She asked some more, and I slightly raised my voice. Barely above what I would use normally, but I was irritated by then and I thought it was a perfectly rational decision to sit there.

After I refused all her requests she stopped and now she sits in the back where I sat yesterday. I don't really mind bc I don't like her; if I am being honest, I prefer sitting alone over sitting next to her, but I am not willing to risk not hearing something important.

My wife (27f) was an ""affair baby"". Her half siblings share the same mother as her but are aware of her status as the child from the affair. She was 7 the last time she saw them but she remembers very clearly they did not like her or accept her. She knows this hasn't changed because they maintain contact with extended family while also not attending anything she might be attending. My wife's parents were married but it became a toxic marriage based on cheating and she's no contact with them as a result.

My wife is pregnant with our first child and this trouble with my parents started when my wife admitted to wishing things could have been different for her and her siblings. My parents told her she should reach out because she never knows how they'd respond. She told them she did know, because they continued to keep their distance and not be around her. That she accepted it and would not push or risk a very vitriol filled rejection from them. But that she appreciated they (my parents) wanted the best for her. My parents told her she shouldn't be so quick to dismiss the idea. And they have brought it up roughly a dozen times since. I have told them to stop and reminded them that this is my wife's decision alone and she should not be backed into a corner by them.

The last time was Friday night. My wife grew frustrated by the mention again and I told my wife we should leave, because clearly this wasn't the right place for us to be at that moment. My parents said we didn't need to leave and they were trying to support my wife. I told them to forget the Hallmark movies and come into the real world where not everyone is desperately waiting to be reunited with family, where people can hold onto resentment and hate for decades and lifetimes, where people refusing to attend an event that another person might be at should be taken at face value and seen as a boundary instead of being treated like a cry for the other person to reach out. I told them it's not destined for a happily ever after when ignore clear signs and reach out anyway.

90,1f7w7fr,AITA for pretending too much?,"I (29F) have been in a relationship for three years with my partner (23M).

When we started dating, having an old family home at my disposal, instead of meeting at our parents' house we started to stay there more and more, until we moved in. So most of our relationship we lived together. It is his first relationship, and out of nowhere he immediately found himself living together with his partner. I had already been in a relationship, but it is my first experience of living together with a partner as well.

He is not a good roommate. He often leaves used tissues lying around, or even if he's at home all day, he doesn't do basic household chores like dishwasher, washing machine, rubbish unless I explicitly remind him. In spite of this most of the time he gets angry when I point it out to him, or dismisses it by joking about it and shutting me up, anyway not taking responsibility. Sometimes he apologizes.

He insists on doing the renovation plans. Excluding the fact that we don't even know whether we want to stay in this city or not, I would ask myself the question: if I am unable to take care of the house, how can I invest in one? He doesn't seem to bother.

For example in the living room there is both his PC area and the table with chairs, sofa etc. During the day he leaves his used clothes in the living room, both his home clothes and his clothes for going out, because ""he has to use them anyway"". When I point out to him that it's a communal environment and that it's not nice to the other people who live there (or possible guests who may come) he says I'm exaggerating and that he's always done it and that his mother used to tell him that, but he did it at home too.

Just once talking about it calmly he admitted that he has a problem, but we still can't find a solution. I have made a mistake that instead of taking matters into my own hands immediately I have tried to be patient or understanding towards a lack of him that may also come from a way of growing up or education that I am not aware of. I also thought it was simply because he is younger. Now, however, I no longer have patience, it makes me sick to come home.

Moreover, most of the time when it comes to going out with my family or friends he says no or jumps me at the last minute. He says it's because of how he is - so OK, maybe I'm more of a pleaser and try to always be there with his family and friends - but there's a difference between being a loner and not being there for your partner.

I'm 18F, all my friends are 18. I'm the only one out of my friends to have my own place. I live in a cute, 2 bedroom townhouse with my baby while my friends still live with their parents. 

My closest friend, I'll call him N, is over a lot. He's over basically every day just to hang out, and he'll occasionally spend a night over. He uses my hot water, eats my food, etc. I charge him nothing, obviously, because he's my best friend. 

He likes to go out - shopping, coffee, drives to the next town over for no reason. I always say I'm happy to drive myself but he insists on driving all 3 of us because he likes listening to music together etc. (I don't drive him because I don't have my full license yet)

He likes to go out - shopping, coffee, drives to the next town over for no reason. I always say I'm happy to drive myself but he insists on driving all 3 of us because he likes listening to music together etc. (I don't drive him because I don't have my full license yet)

95,1f7v27x,AITA For asking for a second wedding ceremony? ,"I (33F) have been with my husband (35M) for about 7 years, married during covid. We recently moved across the country for his job. We have 2 cats, no children, and I've found a new job.

My husband has depression (diagnosed by a doctor). It went untreated for the first half of our relationship because we were broke. The treatment he's gotten the last couple years has been disjointed by changes in jobs/insurance. I've helped him get to appts, checked in as an accountability buddy for therapy homework, and have learned how to survive and keep loving him even when he's low.

During his low times, he sometimes says hurtful things like I'm not likeable or loveable. At first, I thought I was a terrible person and would try to better myself. Over time, I connected it to his low moods and realized that it was the same no matter what I did. I forgave because he always came back and said he loved me (although this could take weeks/months) and we would go back to having a great loving relationship. In the moment, he blames my shortcomings (I am indeed flawed), and later he blames it on the depression. 

With the move and new jobs and everything, we've both been stressed. I've been unhappy for many months due to health problems from covid (ironically caught after the pandemic was ""over""), and he has taken a turn being with someone who is down. I have been  recovering, and he was very encouraging. 

Fast forward to this week, he told me there was nothing likeable about me and that I was not lovable and he wanted to separate. He couldn't handle sacrificing his happiness to be around me anymore. It hurt after all the caring I've done for him and making progress on my health.

How does this relate to our wedding? We started wedding planning before covid. He got cold feet, blaming it on the pressure from his mom/sisters on his mom's elaborate vision for his wedding. We changed to an elopement, and he was ok with that. It got cancelled because of covid, and we ended up just signing the papers, masked with our parents only (no vows). It has come up in arguments in years since that he made no promises about love or hard times, which is technically true. We bought a house, planned for kids, said I love yous, I thought it was implied.

Back to this week, he came back from a hotel after 4 days and decided he didn't want to separate after all. He said he does love me. This is where I might be the AH, I gave him an ultimatum. I asked him to do a new wedding ceremony with me where we do the normal vows or else I won't be able to take him seriously. Just a ceremony at our hometown church with our immediate families.

I think I'm the AH for the ultimatum. He thinks I'm the AH for asking for a ceremony even though we're both introverts who don't like the spotlight, we are married, and him telling me he loves me should be enough.

I am struggling to determine whether I’m letting my prejudices against my mother dictate my actions or whether I am valid in  wanting to skip church.

We moved countries and my mother has not seen her in-person for over 10 years. She’s only had brief FaceTime calls. She has made no other effort to have a relationship but it is understandable; we moved countries partly due to her sour relations with her family. She has been upset with the way my dad is handling things (he is inviting guests over and going to dinners as usual). She is complaining to him and asking him what he would do if his mother had died and bringing up an example of how they mourned when his great aunt died. This didn’t sit well with me but I know she is just trying to feel like people care. 

  
I will admit that it took me a few hours to say I’m sorry for your loss to her; when I finally did, I said it over text. I think she feels left out from her family abroad and is compensating for it by trying to get support. She has complained and been passive aggressive multiple times a day since her grandmothers passing, saying she can’t believe how inconsiderate everyone is for not sympathizing. She went to my dads mom to ask whether it would be rude to miss dinners and weddings to which MIL responded that no it would not; no one here knew her or is mourning her, and she lived a full life that no one would judge her for going to a wedding (two weeks out from now). My mother got very upset and started raising her voice and when alone in the car she told me that she has never gotten good advice from “that woman” and is glad she missed the funeral of her sister in laws grandmother. 

  
My mom is offering mass for her grandmother today (third day in a row). Church is very important to her and when a friend called to ask if they can stop by to say sorry, Mom said she’d rather them come to mass instead of entertaining them for 2 hours at home.

My boyfriend decided to also book a trip to NY to see some friends and possibly meet my parents for the first time. (My parents know he exists but never met him face to face)

A couple of days before our trip, my family received news that my uncle, who lives in Maryland, (my dad’s brother) was in the hospital for cancer complications (bloody stool and bloody vomit). 

They decided to take a road trip to go visit my uncle after I landed so I could watch my 94 grandfather at home.(They left Friday early morning to beat the traffic). This was the day my boyfriend landed who landed Friday night.
-I landed on Thursday, my boyfriend landed on Friday. We both stayed till Monday.

Due to them not being in the state and the circumstances, my boyfriend was unable to meet my parents. To me, this isn’t the right time to introduce him as everyone is worried about my uncle.

Wellll fast forward and my boyfriend’s parents are furious that my “parents couldn’t take 10mins out of their schedule” to meet him. My parents would rather take the time and sit and get to know him rather than a quick 10 min hi-bye.

She and I have gotten along well until our recent conflict. She's asked me if she can wear my clothes as we're the same size and have similar aesthetics.

Also, I'm not in a financial situation where I can easily replace my clothes if they get soiled, damaged, etc. I'm not saying that she's not trustworthy or anything, but I'd still like to be cautious since again I met her two weeks ago and don't know much about her habits yet.

109,1f7qjuv,AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for not caring about his health?,"I \[F19\] have been dating my bf \[M20\] for a year now and I love him very dearly, though we do have the occasional fight. The most common theme in these fights usually stems from his unawareness of other people's feelings, likely due to some form of undiagnosed ADHD or Autism. 

Yesterday, he got into an accident on his way to my house where he passed out while driving and crashed his car. Both people are okay and the damages are small.

My mom is very fond of BF and told me to make a doctor's appointment for the next day to find out why he passed out. I made the appointment even though he said he doesn't really care and finding out why it happened isn't important to him.  
  
We went to the doctors today, I will admit I was very overstimulated when getting ready and left my phone and headphones at home which didn't help (I have a lot of issues with overstimulation) and was not in a good mood.

At the appointment, the doctor asked him how he felt about the situation, and he shrugged and said he didn't care. The doctor explained that if he didn't care, then neither did the doctor. Though he thought it was concerning and should be looked into.

I looked at my boyfriend and he reiterated that he does care and the doctor did some tests before referring him to a neurologist, a heart specialist and an MRI scan. 

I had begun to tell the doctor about my issues but the doctor interrupted me to ask BF if he could not play video games on his phone while I was talking to the doctor and said he could leave if he wanted to.

My boyfriend put his phone down, and I finished my talk. We left the room, but the doctor called me back and told me; ""don't bring this guy back, he clearly doesn't respect his own health or my time. I only took him on as a patient because I respect you and your mother but if it was just him today, I would've kicked him out"".

After the appointment, I called my mom and told her what happened and she understood why I was upset. I told BF that it's embarrassing to be told that by the doctor and that he was being disrespectful.

He said he didn't understand what was disrespectful about how he acted so I explained it again. He still didn't believe he did anything wrong and I told him not to talk to me as I was now very overstimulated and angry.

Once we were in the car, my mom told me I was being bratty and to get over it, she said I was being an asshole and the only reason I was mad was that I was overstimulated.

I feel like I was in the right to be upset as this isn't the first time he has acted childish and I have had to be the one to help him and sort out a situation he's in because he didn't think it was important. As well as the fact that he is always on his phone playing video games in public, like during dinners, at restaurants, and when we are having important discussions. I have spoken to him about both of these things and how they upset me but he doesn't feel as if it's that bad.

110,1f7qj33,AITA for reminding my sister of a bet I made with her and that she owes me money.,"I have a sister who is 5 years younger to me and graduated with a computer science degree last year. I also have a CS degree and have been working in the field for 5 years.

Last year when she graduated, I made a bet with her that she would eventually become a product manager or program manager or recruiter in tech and not a programmer / software engineer. I made this bet without thinking there is anything wrong with those careers per say, but she insisted she wants to be a software engineer and not an adjacent job where she 'works on Microsoft office all day'.

She tried applying for software engineering roles but because she lacked skills and genuine passion companies saw through it and all rejected her. She even interviewed with google and never ended up getting a team match.

Granted I actually thought she would work as a software engineer, realize that doing technical work at that level was not her forte and then switch to product management like so many other people I know who are like her have. I do not think there is anything wrong with that as coding for production needs is not for everyone. She is very different from most programmers and a social butterfly type who would not fit well into such a role. She claims this is not the case but her 'passion' for tech imo has always been fake and just copying what I did and went into it because she saw how successful I was. I remember when I started college and installed linux for a class, she also did the same the next week on her own computer and when she was in school she tried hard to fit in by joining all the tech related clubs.

She just finally got a job offer as a junior product manager and will be accepting it after the same company rejected her for a developer role.

AITA here, if the situation were reversed I would have no issue admitting when I am wrong.",Asshole,2024-09-03,"AITA for reminding my sister of a bet I made with her and that she owes me money. I have a sister who is 5 years younger to me and graduated with a computer science degree last year. I also have a CS degree and have been working in the field for 5 years.

Last year when she graduated, I made a bet with her that she would eventually become a product manager or program manager or recruiter in tech and not a programmer / software engineer. I made this bet without thinking there is anything wrong with those careers per say, but she insisted she wants to be a software engineer and not an adjacent job where she 'works on Microsoft office all day'.

She tried applying for software engineering roles but because she lacked skills and genuine passion companies saw through it and all rejected her. She even interviewed with google and never ended up getting a team match.

Granted I actually thought she would work as a software engineer, realize that doing technical work at that level was not her forte and then switch to product management like so many other people I know who are like her have. I do not think there is anything wrong with that as coding for production needs is not for everyone. She is very different from most programmers and a social butterfly type who would not fit well into such a role. She claims this is not the case but her 'passion' for tech imo has always been fake and just copying what I did and went into it because she saw how successful I was. I remember when I started college and installed linux for a class, she also did the same the next week on her own computer and when she was in school she tried hard to fit in by joining all the tech related clubs.

She just finally got a job offer as a junior product manager and will be accepting it after the same company rejected her for a developer role.

When my husband confronted them, they said I was being immature at the bar when all I did was dance and sit down with a bottled water.

I found it highly offensive and disrespectful to talk to the homeowner like that when you barely know them. 
I talk to my husband the next day and tell him how I felt. We both agreed I should communicate my issue with her and resolve the problem. I typed up a paragraph stating how I felt as respectful as I could.

112,1f7q40p,AITA for sending my nephew the gift he chose for his birthday without a return card? ,"My nephew is 5. Close to the end of the pandemic his parents needed help and I stayed with them for 6 months helping to take care of him, so he is very special. I do not see him much anymore though -on average 10-15 days a year, when we overlap our visits to my hometown. We talk daily on his way to school with my brother (his father). Of course, when I see him, I spoil him: I play a lot with him and his younger brother, and buy them gifts.

I saw him 20 days ago, and I had gotten him close to 20 Playmobil toys (in 10 packages -they were all part of a theme, but we wanted the excitement of a package each day --edit to clarify: they were tiny packages, pretty much part of one gift). His father and I had played a lot with Playmobils growing up. Nephew loved them. Played with them, loved making stories with them. I left town afterward, and my sister who stayed back said that he was playing with them every day. When he was about to leave, he went to the toy-store, and saw a big Playmobil box, and told my sister he wanted it. She said that since he was leaving Europe and coming to the US (where I also live), she would talk to me to send it to him to his home.

On Friday, it was his birthday. The Playmobil he wanted was expensive -and I found out they are not so easy to find in the US - but he wanted it, so I ordered and sent it to him.

The next day, my brother sent me a message that they will not give it to him. Apparently, when his mother went to pack the other 20 Playmobils before returning to the US, he told her 'leave them here, aunties will send me new ones home.' My sister was there and she said he wanted to have something to come back to. But my SIL says we spoiled her son excessively, and he can't appreciate things. I mean, I do understand he has a lot, but this was the first year he could pick what he wanted, and I wanted him to know that we listened to him, especially since we do not see him often. And I thought that it was his birthday, it wasn't just random gift. So, I did not include a return card.

Now, my sister-in-law never really liked me... not sure why, but even though I supported their relationship at first, once they got engaged, she made it pretty clear that she didn't want to have a relationship with me. She was only nice (sort of) during the time I was helping them. That is why I do not visit them and only see them when they travel to our hometown.

But this time, I received a warning through my brother that I am never to give her child a gift, without a return card/gift receipt. They have not even asked me to start a return which makes me suspect that she plans to throw it away. She has returned gifts in the past for useful stuff (like a chair instead of a toy). I would love to contribute to their expenses, if they needed it, but they do make good money (way more than me) to both buy necessities and toys. So, I felt it is okay if I can show my nephew who doesn't understand at his age why we do not meet more often, that I think of him with something tangible that he really wants.

113,1f7pvhr,AITA for asking my partner not to play a D&D game I’m not playing in?,"
I’ve been playing with a D&D group for about four years. A couple of years ago I asked if my partner, A, could join and the DM said yes. A year ago the DM asked if I was ok taking a break from game for a bit, said it was still in the group and the server but said it seemed like a needed a break. I assumed because I’d had to miss games during a very busy work time.

I started working to rearrange my work schedule so I’d have time off when games were scheduled and make up lost hours on the weekend or after hours. Then, someone else in the server, I’ll call B posted about wanting to run another game and posted a link to the server we were all in so I clicked and expressed interested.

B then messaged me and told me “To be perfectly honest, I don't feel entirely comfortable with you joining my campaign, especially since this is my first time running a homebrew campaign like this. With how many people are already going to be playing on top of some of the behavior you have exhibited while playing with us in the past, I'm unfortunately going to have to say no to letting you join my campaign.”

This was the first time I learned there were any issues with me this group. When the DM talked to me about taking a break, he specifically said I hadn’t done anything and he wasn’t upset. So I was blindsided. I then learned from B that people had issues with things I’d done but no one told me so I didn’t know…

My partner continued to play the main game and even invited another mutual friend to join. I was really hurt by this. Because people doing things and me being excluded is a trigger. I’m autistic and I was excluded a lot and bullied in middle school. In high school my birth mother abandoned me so I was sent to live with my aunt and uncle who have a daughter a year younger than me and when she had friends over I was told I was to stay in my room and not hang out with her friends. Stay in your room, stay quiet, pretend you don’t exist. I didn’t go on summer vacations with them. I was left behind got alone while they went out to eat as a family. I was asked to step out so they could get just family photos. At 18 I was forced to move out and not welcomed back. 

So not being wanted is triggering. I know that other people do not owe me anything. No one has to like me. I try to do my best not to upset anyone and make others happy, but it’s hard when I do something wrong and no one tells me. My partner continuing to play in the game and inviting another person I thought cared about me really hurt my feelings, because they didn’t care I wasn’t invited and were happy to go have fun without me. 

I left the apartment and locked myself in the car to cry alone for hours during the game and it went on for months. When our lease was almost up I told my partner I wanted to get a place of my own because I couldn’t deal with them playing game there (online) when I wasn’t welcome at that game. So I thought it would be better if I had my own space.

My partner then talked to the DM who talked to me, and we worked out that I didn’t know I’d done anything wrong and no one had told me. So he actually explained the issues and how I could work on them. He let me into the game provisionally to see if I improved with constructive criticism and clean boundaries and expectations. I did and was invited back.

A couple weeks ago, the DM had to step away due to person issues and the group, on voice chat with me there, talked about what we would do and B mentioned the game they were running and starting that in the old game’s time slot. (The time I rearranged my schedule to have open). 

Last week asked if we what were we doing? And B messaged me “hey, sky. At this point i'm gonna be sticking to just the players that i've already got. additionally, please, if you're going to ask stuff like this again ask me in dms and not in the group chat with everyone else.”

I apologized, I assumed since they were talking about the group playing that game with everyone else I could ask about there.

I hate myself for not getting these things. 

So now my partner is set to be playing that game next week and it hurts. Being in a group of people and seeing everyone else invited to do something when you aren’t does not feel good, and watching your partner go off with them/not care that you’re the only one not invited hurts.

However, asking them not to play feels like a controlling, abusive move, because my partner can do things that don’t involve me and hang out with people without me/regardless of if I’m invited. ",TL;DR,2024-09-03,"AITA for asking my partner not to play a D&D game I’m not playing in?

116,1f7ppre,WIBTA if I discouraged my boyfriend from moving away for a job? ,"Before you judge, this is a complicated situation that I’m am unsure how to handle. I am going to explain it as best as I can. I have a bf that got a job in a different state. While it does bother me that he isn’t going to be as close anymore, that’s not my main concern. My main concern is that he’s rushing into this job. He hasn’t gotten a lot of job offers so he was excited to get this one. However, he is completely unprepared to move. I’m just going to list off all my reasons why I’m thinking about discouraging him from moving:
• He currently doesn’t have a living situation waiting on him. He has no clue if he’s going to get approved for an apartment due to not having a job yet and lack of a guarantor. He cannot find a guarantor bc most apartments want the guarantor to make at least five times the rent, and he comes from a low income family.
• He’s had less than a month to get this move together.
• He tells me all the time that he doesn’t want to move there and shows zero excitement about going there.
• He said he’s coming back as soon as he finds a job in our home state. This means he could be trapped in a lease if he can’t find  anyone to sublease. It also means he might be risking a move half way across the country for a couple of months (or even weeks bc he has a lot of interviews lined up).
• He’s got a job offer that he’s waiting on a background check to clear with. Which he also plans on going to as soon as it clears. He has zero criminal record, so he should be fine.
• The worst part imo: he’s moving in less than a week. He is moving to a new state in less than a week with the risk of having to live in an hotel or airbnb for an unknown amount of time on a tight income (his new job pays well but I’m sure you all know how expensive it is to live in a hotel or airbnb).

My plan was to ask him to stay in our state and get a lesser paying job until the background check clears, which should be before the year ends. I just want to know WIBTA if I suggested that to him. I also wanted to add that if he had more time to make a decision like this, I would 100% encourage him to
move. 




",Not enough info,2024-09-03,"WIBTA if I discouraged my boyfriend from moving away for a job?  Before you judge, this is a complicated situation that I’m am unsure how to handle. I am going to explain it as best as I can. I have a bf that got a job in a different state. While it does bother me that he isn’t going to be as close anymore, that’s not my main concern. My main concern is that he’s rushing into this job. He hasn’t gotten a lot of job offers so he was excited to get this one. However, he is completely unprepared to move. I’m just going to list off all my reasons why I’m thinking about discouraging him from moving:
• He currently doesn’t have a living situation waiting on him. He has no clue if he’s going to get approved for an apartment due to not having a job yet and lack of a guarantor. He cannot find a guarantor bc most apartments want the guarantor to make at least five times the rent, and he comes from a low income family.

117,1f7phs5,AITA for Refusing to Use a Bit on My Mule?,"I (17F) have a 19-year-old mule named Hare who stands at 18 hands and weighs around 1400 pounds. I’ve had him since I was 9, and we’ve been through a lot together. He’s always been gentle and calm, and I’ve trained him using positive reinforcement. Hare is incredibly well-trained and has always been ridden with just a neck rope.

Recently, my older sister (29F) came to visit with her two young sons, who are 5 and 7 for a few weeks. They’re new to riding, and while my sister doesn’t know much about equines, she has expressed concern about Hare. She’s worried that Hare might hurt her sons because he’s so large and strong. She insisted that we use a bit on him while the boys are riding, arguing that it would give them more control and make her feel safer.

I’ve always felt that a bit isn’t necessary for Hare. He’s been ridden without one for years, and using just a neck rope has always worked well for us. Hare is very responsive to the neck rope, and he’s never given me any trouble. I’m concerned that using a bit might actually be harmful or uncomfortable for him, especially since he’s used to being ridden without one.

My sister’s fear is that Hare might act out and potentially hurt her sons, even though they’ve ridden him perfectly fine with just the neck rope. I understand her concerns, but I genuinely believe that a bit isn’t needed in this situation. I also worry that the kids might yank or pull on the bit, which could hurt Hare or make him uncomfortable.

I tried to explain my point of view to my sister, but she’s adamant that the bit is necessary for safety. I’ve tried to assure her that Hare is gentle and well-trained, but she’s not convinced.

121,1f7ovji,AITA for cleaning my kids up in an RV park parking lot after they both had accidents?,"We were driving back from San Antonio to Houston this afternoon and had a double whammy of accidents with our kids.

My 2-year-old daughter needed to pee. If you have done this drive, then you know there are miles of road with no rest areas or gas stations. When she couldn’t hold it anymore, we took the next exit and were going to just stop at the first place we came to. We have a fold up travel potty for times like this.

Now I said double whammy because when we were exiting, my 1-year-old son threw up on himself. 

We came to an RV park. We parked in the “visitor parking” section directly off of the road. I ran and got the potty set up but right before I got my daughter’s pants down she had an accident on the concrete.

As I was sitting her on the potty in case she had anymore, a resident of the park walked up to us saying “what are you doing? Do you need any help?” I thought he was being polite so I answered “my daughter just had an accident and my son got sick, I’m just cleaning them up.”

He proceeded to accost me and my wife, telling us this was private property and we shouldn’t have parked there. Saying we were “doing all this in front of his home.” Asking why we didn’t go to a rest area. I thought maybe he didn’t understand so I explained the situation again. 

He didn’t care, he just kept repeating that it was his home and private property. And to give some context, we were on the edge of the property reversed into a spot against a fence that ran along the main road. Between us and his trailer was the car lot, welcome center, road that connected rows of trailers, then his lot. It’s not like we parked in front of his trailer making a scene. 

He walked away until I scooped up a handful of throw up and tossed it in the grass. I threw it over the property fence and into a ditch between the RV park and the main road, NOT towards his trailer. 

He came back out asking “what I just threw in his yard” and asking me “how would you feel if someone was doing this in your front yard?” I really wanted to respond with something snarky, but my wife and I had decided we wouldn’t engage with him if he came back out and would just call 911. When he kept talking about private property my wife called. He just stood there watching me clean my son’s seat from about 5 feet away. 

They sent 2 deputies out, however I had my kids all cleaned up and back in their seats so the 911 operator said we could leave if we felt safe even though the deputies hadn’t arrived yet. He stared at us the entire time that we pulled away from the lot. 

We did not leave any trash, and I wouldn’t have even if he wasn’t standing there. The only evidence of us being there was a wet spot on the concrete where my daughter had her accident and a handful of throw up in the ditch.

For context, i live on the first floor of an apartment building, and the first floor is partially underground. I have full size windows but the ground starts maybe 6 inches below the window. In front of my window is a large lawn that no one walks on or uses, it’s just empty space that later becomes the complex’s parking lot.

It was weird but I didn’t give it much thought until about 10 minutes later, I saw him walk by again. This time he stood in front of my window, looking down at me and I couldn’t help but meet his eyes. He shouted at me through the window “Hey I live on the third floor let me in!”. At this point I was so taken aback that I said “Sure one moment” and was about to walk to the apartment entrance when it occurred to me just how strange this was. It looked like he was locked out of the building and he was looking IN at people’s apartments to see if he could get the attention of someone to let him in. Before I did anything, I consulted my girlfriend who was watching tv in the other room, and her first response was to close all the blinds in the apartment and lower the sound on the TV. I understood why she did do, but I couldn’t help but feel bad for the guy who was seemingly locked out on Labor Day. I’ve never seen him before or since, but it’s very likely he lives in the building, the residents are mostly young or old, and i really don’t know any of the residents here.

The building has doorbells he could have rung, and even if he got in, he would need the key for his apartment (unless it was unlocked).

123,1f7om8m,AITA for standing my ground during a birthday dinner?,"I (50F) have a son who recently turned 18.

We were going out to celebrate his birthday with a family dinner with our family and his aunt and uncle. The night before, I asked him where he wanted to go, and he decided on an Indian restaurant we usually go to. Just to see if he wanted to switch it up or try something different because it's a special occasion, I suggested another Indian restaurant we went to once about 5 years ago and recently re-opened. He declined, saying that he didn't remember the restaurant and didn't know if the quality would still be the same 5 years later. I then suggested a new sushi restaurant that had caught my eye. He declined again because he didn't want to ""run the risk of having a bad restaurant for \[his\] birthday"". So we stayed with the normal Indian restaurant.

The next day, his aunt and uncle (my SIL and BIL) came over. They are very nice people and my son loves them a lot. I realized that they had already been to my son's chosen Indian restaurant twice already. I didn't want to bore our guests. So I brought up a new Greek restaurant that had also caught my eye, and asked my son to look at the menu. He looked through it rather quickly and declined. But then I remembered there was a new Italian restaurant that I wanted to do for my birthday but felt like my son would really like too. And when I asked him to look at that place's menu, he said okay.

When we arrived at the Italian restaurant that night, we noticed that a more fast-food pasta cafe had a location across the freeway. My BIL 'joked' that we could have gone there because it was cheaper. My son laughed, but I personally took offense to that. Dinner gets served, and the food was really good. However, the two cake slices for dessert came out rather small, as if they cut it in half and served it to us as if it were two slices. And sure enough, the bill included two desserts, not one. So I felt like we had been scammed.

We passed the same fast-food pasta cafe driving back home. My husband 'joked' about how my son chose a fishy restaurant that scammed us. My son says, ""Hey, this wasn't my choice."" But then my SIL follows up with a ""could've gone to the fast-food pasta place and they wouldn't have scammed us for $20"" 'joke'. My son, now laughing, says, ""Well maybe talk to the person who chose the restaurant."" He is being extremely disrespectful towards me. And all these 'jokes' are offensive. (Note my apostrophes.) It's well past 3 strikes, and I shout that next time I'll keep my f\*\*king mouth shut. I'm not going to stand being attacked like this since my son is an adult who can make his own decisions. 

When we arrived home, my son tried to apologize. I didn't want to hear it. Later on, he tries to ask me how my dinner was. This was a fake attempt to make me feel better and apologize again. So I calmly reminded him again that I didn't want to talk about the dinner. And that was it. I didn't want to be reminded of how I was attacked over a simple restaurant.

AITA?",Asshole,2024-09-03,"AITA for standing my ground during a birthday dinner? I (50F) have a son who recently turned 18.

We were going out to celebrate his birthday with a family dinner with our family and his aunt and uncle. The night before, I asked him where he wanted to go, and he decided on an Indian restaurant we usually go to. Just to see if he wanted to switch it up or try something different because it's a special occasion, I suggested another Indian restaurant we went to once about 5 years ago and recently re-opened. He declined, saying that he didn't remember the restaurant and didn't know if the quality would still be the same 5 years later. I then suggested a new sushi restaurant that had caught my eye. He declined again because he didn't want to ""run the risk of having a bad restaurant for \[his\] birthday"". So we stayed with the normal Indian restaurant.

The next day, his aunt and uncle (my SIL and BIL) came over. They are very nice people and my son loves them a lot. I realized that they had already been to my son's chosen Indian restaurant twice already. I didn't want to bore our guests. So I brought up a new Greek restaurant that had also caught my eye, and asked my son to look at the menu. He looked through it rather quickly and declined. But then I remembered there was a new Italian restaurant that I wanted to do for my birthday but felt like my son would really like too. And when I asked him to look at that place's menu, he said okay.

When we arrived at the Italian restaurant that night, we noticed that a more fast-food pasta cafe had a location across the freeway. My BIL 'joked' that we could have gone there because it was cheaper. My son laughed, but I personally took offense to that. Dinner gets served, and the food was really good. However, the two cake slices for dessert came out rather small, as if they cut it in half and served it to us as if it were two slices. And sure enough, the bill included two desserts, not one. So I felt like we had been scammed.

We passed the same fast-food pasta cafe driving back home. My husband 'joked' about how my son chose a fishy restaurant that scammed us. My son says, ""Hey, this wasn't my choice."" But then my SIL follows up with a ""could've gone to the fast-food pasta place and they wouldn't have scammed us for $20"" 'joke'. My son, now laughing, says, ""Well maybe talk to the person who chose the restaurant."" He is being extremely disrespectful towards me. And all these 'jokes' are offensive. (Note my apostrophes.) It's well past 3 strikes, and I shout that next time I'll keep my f\*\*king mouth shut. I'm not going to stand being attacked like this since my son is an adult who can make his own decisions. 

When we arrived home, my son tried to apologize. I didn't want to hear it. Later on, he tries to ask me how my dinner was. This was a fake attempt to make me feel better and apologize again. So I calmly reminded him again that I didn't want to talk about the dinner. And that was it. I didn't want to be reminded of how I was attacked over a simple restaurant.

124,1f7o9mv,WIBTA if I tell my mom I'm uncomfortable with her new boyfriend?,"So, recently my (F24) mom (F51) started dating one of her colleagues. This shouldn't be something that bothers me, she divorced my dad 5 years ago and has been single since then.

Thing is; her colleague used to be my biology's teacher when I was in middle school and highschool, and I hated him. You see, I used to be a really good student, never had to study a lot to get a good grades being my normal grades between 8 - 9 (in my country grades go between 1 to 10 being 10 the highest and 6 the minimum for passing) but the first year I had him as a teacher I hated it, all the test I had that year were 5 or 4, just enough to not pass and having to do make-up tests, which in his class was an oral exam. Every time I had to do the make-up test I would pass at first try with a 9 or even with 10 without studying too much.

Fast forward to the pandemic, 2021, the previous year my sister (same school) lacked so much in her grades she almost does not pass the year, so to prevent it from happening again my mom went and got the numbers for all her teachers, including the biology teacher. At some point in the school year my sister slipped in his class about my parents divorce. Lo and behold, he had a crush on my mom so he started talking to her outside working hours and so. At first my mom was adamant about it because the divorce really messed her up but last month she told us she is seeing with someone, and yes is him.

My mom came down to visit me for labor day weekend and she decided to bring me some groceries since I have been telling her that's it's been hard finding time to cook between school and my jobs.

I responded to her when I woke up and said once again I was sorry for the mishap and would pay her back for the food but didn't think it would be a good idea to talk to my mom and that we should just leave the situation as is especially since my mom was leaving that day.

I was with Brit for the weekend and we had a great time at comicon. On Sunday we were to meet up with Kat and Randy at the concert. We decided to carpool to the concert together from Randy’s house as he lived in the city of the concert. B and I showed up and we all took Kats’s car. The concert was a lot of fun. After, Kat and Randy dropped Brit and I off at her car where we then all made the hour drive back to where we lived. 

About ten minutes into the drive I realized I couldn’t find my phone and was freaking out thinking it was on the ground somewhere or I forgot it at the concert. Brit called up Kat and Randy to ask them to look in the backseat of their car for my phone. They essentially said they couldn’t see anything in the dark but will look when they are back (another 45-50 minutes). Because of that Brit and I went back to check if my phone fell out switching cars where is wasn’t there. I luckily had my iPad with me and was able to text the one person who has my find my iPhone to see where it was. It was confirmed that it was likely in Kat’s car. Brit and I made the drive back and asked to meet the others at a mutual spot. We finally got there and Kat handed me my phone and I was thankful. I was just super stressed out thinking I lost my phone.

After that Kat basically ignored me the whole week and then texted me at the end. She was upset that I accidentally forgot my phone in her car and that they had to wait 30 minutes for Brit and I to make it to get my phone and the first thing out of my mouth wasn’t an immediate thank you even though I did thank her before she left. She was also mad that we suggested a spot and didn’t choose the spot she wanted. Now to be clear Brit was the one texting since I was too freaked out to think right so I don’t know Kat mentioned a meeting place. I told Kat that I did thank her and that I didn’t leave my phone on her car out of malice. She and Randy refused to look more in the backseat while they were driving even though Randy could have looked back there more. I also said that Brit and I couldn’t control the amount of time they had on us because there are speed limits and we weren’t going to go 100 on the highway to make it there faster. We let them know when we were five minutes away and they could have easily gone home and then waited until then. She had also turned down meeting us at a different location before the one she agreed to. The one she suggested was like a two minutes difference that would have really made no impact on how long it took her to get home. So am I in the wrong because I accidentally left my phone in her car?

For context my husband and I, both 27, moved into his grandma's a couple years ago due to her falling and breaking her hip. Our area we live in used to be a screened in porch that was made into an addition. The main part of the house is separate from our small part.

A year ago the neighbors in the duplex next door were evicted and decided to leave their small terrier mix behind. Mary, my husband's grandma, took this dog in because he got along with her rescued Pomeranian. My husband and I own two dogs. One is a lab/heeler mix who weighs around 65 pounds and our second dog is a corgi/heeler mix who's at around 35-40 pounds. 

At first all four dogs got along fine. About 7 months into the terrier mix being brought into the family he showed some problematic behavior. The terrier mix went after my lab mix over food. He was attacking my dogs face until my dog drop the treat he was trying to eat. I was sitting next to Mary when this happened and while I got up to intervene I looked at Mary to see her chuckling at the exchange. I was very upset after that because that can be dangerous. 

I tried to talk to Mary and she wasn't fazed at all stating that she wished my dog would've gone after hers so he would ""learn his lesson"". After that I didn't let any food or toy or any high value item in the yard to try and keep the peace. It was all going well until the terrier decided to go after my corgi mix twice. Both times I had to physically block the terrier from chasing after my corgi mix trying to keep attacking him. After the second time I decided I needed to bring this to Mary's attention. I've worked in the dog industry for ten years and most of that time was spent in behavioral evaluation. I tried to keep it as simple and straight to the point as I could. 

Voicing my concerns about his behavior and how if this continues going on unchecked that he will end up hurt or worse. My dogs are very passive and they avoid conflict. I know that they both have limits just like the nicest person does and if you push them far enough they will retaliate. Mary was letting the terrier out every time mine were out because he would sit there by the siding glass door and bark constantly. During my conversation with her I was actively crying because I didn't want any of the dogs to end up hurt or worse. 

After a few days Mary's daughter my husband's mother Ruby came by and talked to Mary. While they were talking Mary said that I only talk to her to blame her dog and saying I'm targeting him maliciously. I know my dogs aren't perfect but they're not the ones instigating things.

I was sitting next to Mary when this happened and while I got up to intervene I looked at Mary to see her chuckling at the exchange. I was very upset after that because that can be dangerous. 

I tried to talk to Mary and she wasn't fazed at all stating that she wished my dog would've gone after hers so he would ""learn his lesson"". After that I didn't let any food or toy or any high value item in the yard to try and keep the peace. It was all going well until the terrier decided to go after my corgi mix twice. Both times I had to physically block the terrier from chasing after my corgi mix trying to keep attacking him. After the second time I decided I needed to bring this to Mary's attention. I've worked in the dog industry for ten years and most of that time was spent in behavioral evaluation. I tried to keep it as simple and straight to the point as I could. 

Voicing my concerns about his behavior and how if this continues going on unchecked that he will end up hurt or worse. My dogs are very passive and they avoid conflict. I know that they both have limits just like the nicest person does and if you push them far enough they will retaliate. Mary was letting the terrier out every time mine were out because he would sit there by the siding glass door and bark constantly. During my conversation with her I was actively crying because I didn't want any of the dogs to end up hurt or worse. 

After a few days Mary's daughter my husband's mother Ruby came by and talked to Mary. While they were talking Mary said that I only talk to her to blame her dog and saying I'm targeting him maliciously. I know my dogs aren't perfect but they're not the ones instigating things. This is where I feel like TA. I may have overstepped by informing her of her dogs behavior and warning her of the implications of it.

131,1f7n6lr,AITA for not inviting my mom’s side to my wedding,"
I (28M) am getting married next month to my fiancée (27F). We both grew up about an hour outside of a major city, but met when we moved there for our jobs. We fell in love and have been together 3 years. She had a normal upbringing with a loving two-parent home. I didn’t.

My mom (55F) was emotionally and verbally abusive to me and my brother (26M) growing up and eventually my parents went through a contentious divorce. Since then, nearly all relationships with my mother have disintegrated due to her behavior (constant lying, thousands of text messages despite being asked for no contact, restraining orders). 

I’ve maintained intermittent contact with her because she’s still my mother, and I’d feel awful if anything happened to her and no one knew. I wound down contact after some nonsense she pulled about 1.5 years ago, but still keep tabs on her through the aforementioned unwanted texts.

For our wedding, my fiancée was able to take advantage of a deal on a lovely venue through her uncle and get married in the city instead of where we’re from. Not only is this a dream space, it’s also hours away from where my mom lives now and is a member’s only establishment, so we felt as confident as possible that my mother couldn’t come without having to spend thousands on security.

I’ve always felt conflicted over inviting my mother to my wedding. No one on either side has any contact with her and my fiancée has never met her (she spoke to her on the phone once or twice). I know I can’t invite my mom to my wedding because she is the type to scream, cry and cause a scene. She wouldn’t see what the problem with doing that is, and say it is her right as my mother to be there and do or say whatever she wants.

I am close with my mom’s mom (83F) and she was a major part of my life growing up. she doesn’t have a relationship with my mom right now but she would do anything to be able to. I’m vaguely aware of the fact that surrounding major life events, my grandmother will try to reconnect with my mom, often by sharing information about me and my brother that we don’t want my mom to know.

Because of this, I chose to not tell my grandmother about my wedding, only my step grandfather who promised to not let this information seep out to my mom. To prevent any other potential leaks, I’ve chosen not to invite my maternal bio grandfather, either of my mom’s siblings and none of my maternal cousins.

I know that this will break my grandmothers heart, especially if my mom isn’t invited. She understands why we don’t have a relationship with her, but will still ask me to call my mom every Mother’s Day, birthday, etc. my focus is on having the best wedding with my fiancée and making sure she isn’t stressed about a scene from a woman she has never met, especially because we got our wedding venue from her family.

I (17f) have had to share a room with my brother (20m) for my whole life simply because my family cannot afford a bigger house, it sucks but it is what it is. 

So I recently started school again after my summer break and have been massively sleep deprived due to the fact that my brother is constantly on his xbox from hours 8pm - 2am, I wouldn’t have a problem if he was silent whilst playing but having someone in the same room as you screaming their lungs out while also having to put up with a huge light from the tv screen fucking sucks. 

I’m not even allowed to be in my OWN room if he doesn’t want me in there and my parents have given up and yell at me like I’m the problem. Again, I wouldn’t mind not being in my room if there was somewhere else I could sit in peace but there is not! 

Going to school with minimal sleep and having to just put up with this bs is genuinely killing me and I didn’t know what to do so I decided to just unplug everything from my brothers xbox. And yes, he flipped the fuck out at me and my parents ran to his aid and I got a mouthful about being ‘difficult’ and to just ‘put up with it’ 

I really don’t see how I was in the wrong here and let me put it into perspective, my brother is not in school, unemployment and a fucking degenerate living of my parents when their already struggling enough. 

Honestly any advice that anyone has is appreciated and very much needed. unfortunately I’m unable to move out being 17 and I don’t have the funding for that regardless.

I’m on the spectrum, so I only have one close friend. This friend, however, can be pretty harsh or blunt, which often makes my girlfriend uncomfortable. Because of this, I usually limit the time we all spend together, but when we do hang out, she tolerates him.

I’ve been trying to plan something special for my birthday with my girlfriend, but every time I bring it up, she downplays it or changes the subject. It’s been a bit disheartening, so I decided to just consider a trip to Miami we were planning later in November (a modeling gig) as my birthday celebration.

About a week ago, my best friend asked if my girlfriend and I had passports, and when I asked why, he mentioned he was thinking about a cruise, though he wasn’t sure when. Last night, he surprised me by telling me he had booked a cruise for four to Mexico for the week of my birthday. He booked it so that my girlfriend and I could join, along with another person of our choice.

I was excited and wanted to say yes right away, but I knew my girlfriend might be upset, so I waited until this morning to share the news. When I told her, she got really angry. She said that my friend was overstepping boundaries and that she had actually planned to take me to the beach in North Carolina as a surprise for my birthday. She also said she doesn’t feel safe around him and doesn’t want to leave the country with him. Because of this, she said she doesn’t want to go on the cruise and would prefer I didn’t either.

Now, I’m torn. I’ve been in abusive relationships before where I didn’t notice obvious red flags, so I’m trying to be cautious. I understand how others might find my friend intense, but my girlfriend has known him for five years. I also want to respect her feelings, but she didn’t mention her birthday plans until I brought up the cruise (so it felt like more of a reaction than an actual plan)

I also played a sport at the time and f constantly told me how it didn't matter if I thought one of my teammates that I had known longer than f was my best friend because f was my true best friend. The longer I was friends with her, the more I learned about her family life. Her father was in jail, her mother was chronically ill, she hated her sister, and her other sister lived somewhere else. In sixth grade, I made a new friend who I'm going to call J and F hated that friend and didn't want me making new friends.

If she didn't like something or someone, I wasn't allowed to like it, and if she liked something, I wasn't allowed to dislike it. Most of our conversations revolved around these things or how her grades were bad even though she was a straight A student, making at least a 98 in every class (except math, which was a 95). Eventually she decided she wanted to be adopted by my family and at first I thought she was joking and I had the attitude of ""Haha whatever sure they wouldn't actually adopt you though"" but she continued with constantly talking about my family adopting her and so I started panicking and telling her things to change her mind like ""you don't like my sister or my dad, we don't have a spare bed, our cats destroyed the couch"" and stuff like that. At some point, she caught on and got mad at me. She asked if I was trying to sabotage her adoption, and I said no, but she persisted until I finally said yes. When she asked me why I at first told her my family would never adopt her because they honestly wouldn't but she said she could make them adopt her so I made up an excuse about how I'm already the least favorite and commonly ignored (which is true) so it would probably be worse if we had yet another kid who was better than me at everything. She looked me dead in the eyes and told me, ""I know you have family problems, but my problems are more important. You're being selfish for having two parents."" And the worst part is she meant this. A lot of our conversations after that were me talking about an interest of mine to distract from the adoption thing or just saying one word answers.

Eventually she decided she wanted to be adopted by my family and at first I thought she was joking and I had the attitude of ""Haha whatever sure they wouldn't actually adopt you though"" but she continued with constantly talking about my family adopting her and so I started panicking and telling her things to change her mind like ""you don't like my sister or my dad, we don't have a spare bed, our cats destroyed the couch"" and stuff like that. At some point, she caught on and got mad at me. She asked if I was trying to sabotage her adoption, and I said no, but she persisted until I finally said yes. When she asked me why I at first told her my family would never adopt her because they honestly wouldn't but she said she could make them adopt her so I made up an excuse about how I'm already the least favorite and commonly ignored (which is true) so it would probably be worse if we had yet another kid who was better than me at everything. She looked me dead in the eyes and told me, ""I know you have family problems, but my problems are more important. You're being selfish for having two parents."" And the worst part is she meant this. A lot of our conversations after that were me talking about an interest of mine to distract from the adoption thing or just saying one word answers. At the end of the year she was going to go somewhere with me and my family to celebrate graduating middle school but when I told her our plans she complained about them and when I offered to change them she had complained again and told me not to and she would just deal with it. After the ceremony, I pretended I couldn't find her and rushed my family out of there. I talked to her a couple of days afterward because I messaged her, but I haven't talked to her since, and she hasn't tried to reach out. I'm kind of glad I don't go to the same school as her anymore and I also feel free because I'm free to like whatever I want but I also feel bad because she's my best friend and I feel bad for just not talking to her anymore. Some of my friends still talk to her daily so I might see her at their birthdays but I really don't know what to do.",,-0.0024670229759067297,0,0
138,1f7mbgu,AITA for skipping my uncles funeral?,"My uncle passed away recently. We weren’t close at all - I don’t think I’ve spoken to him in about 15 years, and in all honesty I didn’t hold him in much regard/wasn’t close at all. To be perfectly blunt, he wasn’t a very nice person. 

The funeral is in quite a rural part of the country so would require three days off work (travel there, funeral, travel back). I only have three PTO days left for the rest of the year so it would seriously curtail other plans I have. (I’ve already asked if I could take it as compassionate leave but it isn’t part of our company policy since he wasn’t a close relative such as parent or sibling, etc)

It will also cost me close to $900; the shifts I will need to take PTO for are anti-social hours shifts where we get $250 per shift (So I’m thinking $750 in lost earnings plus travel)

In short, spending almost $1000 and the rest of my PTO for a relative I never saw and didn’t much like seems totally insane. But he was my dad’s brother and I don’t want to come across heartless to my dad in this situation.

Worth saying my dad hasn’t mentioned either way whether he’d want me there. I’m just pre-empting the question because I’m quite anxious about what I’d say if he asked.

139,1f7m79u,WIBTAH for for telling my Grandmother-in-law that she eats enough for the two of us?,"I [31F] lost almost 100lbs during the pandemic. Ever since, the elderly people in my life have taken it upon themselves to comment with every chance they get. ""You're too skinny!"" ""You need to eat something"" "" you looked better when you were bigger"" ""I wish you'd put some weight back on"" ""oh my god! Stop losing weight!"" For reference, I'm 5'5"", 135-145 lbs.

I'm getting annoyed that everytime we have a meal with them (Christmas, Easter, and generally 2-5 other days if not more) it's mentioned how little I eat. I eat so little for two reasons, 1. I'm just not that hungry compared to them. I eat mostly veggies and usually accidentally fill up on appys. 2. I'm an extremely picky eater and don't always like what they serve. I eat enough to fill myself up and generally eat again when I get home. I dint want to be rude by saying ""I just hate what you make"" especially since that's not the only reason. Would I be rude to say ""well it looks like youre eating enough for both of us""? They comment on how much I eat, why am I not afforded the same courtesy? I'd like to teach them a lesson about hpw uncomfortable it is so they maybe stop commenting. I mean, it's been 4 years, let's get over it! I'm not dying, I don't look sickly, I go to the gym and work a physical job so I'm in good shape. Let's all just stop commenting about what others eat, right?

Edit to add: I have politely told them multiple times that I'm happy how I am, my BMI is on target, etc. Every time they comment, I politely reply. For 4 years, 3+ times per year and WAY more now that covid is over. We're talking every other month or so lately.
