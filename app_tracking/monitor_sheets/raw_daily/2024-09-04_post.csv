0,1f8s99h,Update: AITA for asking my partner to help with household chores even though he has his own place,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/BCkifr39Mp

Hi all, I wanted to give a quick update because I really appreciate all the thoughtful comments that came in, they really helped me to clarify my own position. Also, the events of the past few days have blown my mind, though in a positive way (no, nothing at the level of me checking his phone and finding out heâ€™s cheating ðŸ˜‰)

We had a long talk yesterday concerning what had happened and where we saw potential conflicts. Throughout the conversation, I felt very frustrated because I didnâ€™t feel that I was being heard and understood. His comments largely revolved around me needing to ask him, which I was understanding as him shirking the mental load of household chores. At some point I mentioned that I had asked him repeatedly to take out the trash and he hadnâ€™t done so. He disagreed and told me I had only asked him once. We disagreed on this back and forth for a while until it occurred to me that aside from my initially asking him to take out the trash, I had never directly asked him to do so. I had implied that the trash was looking full, I had commented on the swarm of fruit flies, I had looked pointedly at the full trash can, but the only request he had actually understood was the direct verbal request I had made. I had mentioned in the comments that we both suspected that he was on the spectrum, but I was unaware what this really means. Him telling me to tell him was him literally telling me he doesnâ€™t understand nonverbal cues or implied messages, only directly formulated language. We agreed that we would work on getting him a diagnosis and helping him to find tools to understand what people are saying nonverbally and I would work on really verbalizing my feelings more explicitly. I think this is a good move not only for our relationship, but for him in general. Going through the world missing half the information that most other people seem to implicitly understand must be pretty scary. 

Iâ€™m sure this update doesnâ€™t fit the Reddit mold (the police were not called, there was no fistfightâ€¦) but this change in perspective is blowing my mind. It makes me wonder how many other interactions I have had where I assumed people were being intentionally obtuse or lazy but it was just that we were effectively speaking different languages. Iâ€™m not naive enough to think that a diagnosis will solve all our problems or that this might not later emerge as an incompatibility we canâ€™t overcome, but I see it as an avenue to pursue a solution. Iâ€™ve also let him know that I will still call him out for being a lazy ass, Iâ€™ll just have to do very explicitly ðŸ˜‚ 

So thatâ€™s it, we will see where the journey goes from here. If anyone has had similar experiences I would love to hear about them.
