0,1f8s99h,Update: AITA for asking my partner to help with household chores even though he has his own place,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/BCkifr39Mp

Hi all, I wanted to give a quick update because I really appreciate all the thoughtful comments that came in, they really helped me to clarify my own position. Also, the events of the past few days have blown my mind, though in a positive way (no, nothing at the level of me checking his phone and finding out he’s cheating 😉)

We had a long talk yesterday concerning what had happened and where we saw potential conflicts. Throughout the conversation, I felt very frustrated because I didn’t feel that I was being heard and understood. His comments largely revolved around me needing to ask him, which I was understanding as him shirking the mental load of household chores. At some point I mentioned that I had asked him repeatedly to take out the trash and he hadn’t done so. He disagreed and told me I had only asked him once. We disagreed on this back and forth for a while until it occurred to me that aside from my initially asking him to take out the trash, I had never directly asked him to do so. I had implied that the trash was looking full, I had commented on the swarm of fruit flies, I had looked pointedly at the full trash can, but the only request he had actually understood was the direct verbal request I had made. I had mentioned in the comments that we both suspected that he was on the spectrum, but I was unaware what this really means. Him telling me to tell him was him literally telling me he doesn’t understand nonverbal cues or implied messages, only directly formulated language. We agreed that we would work on getting him a diagnosis and helping him to find tools to understand what people are saying nonverbally and I would work on really verbalizing my feelings more explicitly. I think this is a good move not only for our relationship, but for him in general. Going through the world missing half the information that most other people seem to implicitly understand must be pretty scary. 

I’m sure this update doesn’t fit the Reddit mold (the police were not called, there was no fistfight…) but this change in perspective is blowing my mind. It makes me wonder how many other interactions I have had where I assumed people were being intentionally obtuse or lazy but it was just that we were effectively speaking different languages. I’m not naive enough to think that a diagnosis will solve all our problems or that this might not later emerge as an incompatibility we can’t overcome, but I see it as an avenue to pursue a solution. I’ve also let him know that I will still call him out for being a lazy ass, I’ll just have to do very explicitly 😂 

So that’s it, we will see where the journey goes from here. If anyone has had similar experiences I would love to hear about them.

1,1f97lff,WIBTA if I demanded access to my husband’s truck keys?,"Husband has access to my car/car keys to move it out of the garage when more garage space is needed but I don’t have any access to his truck/ truck keys. He will not tell me where the extra set of keys are.

If I, or our child, accidentally leaves something in his truck, then I have to wait for him to come home from work so that he can retrieve it, which is irritating and very inconvenient.

For some background: I’ve never driven the truck (and don’t really have a desire to). I’ve never secretly driven this truck or any of the past cars we’ve had without him knowing. On the one or two occasions when I’ve had to drive his car, I’ve never damaged anything. When asked why I can’t have access to the keys will say that he has ‘one nice thing’ and ask me to just drop it.

I’ve explained that it’s insulting and embarrassing that I’m ’not allowed’ to go into his truck when he isn’t driving it but he still feels strongly that I not have access, even if it is to just get something that was left.

Would I be the asshole for insisting on having access to his truck keys?

Edit to add:
He does feel that I am a messy person and that’s something we have gone back and forth on for years. We both work demanding jobs and we have a child and a dog- I can’t keep the house clutter-free.

I’ve seen her maybe 3-4 times in her life: she was sent to visit me when she was a child 75% of those times and the most recent I visited her when she was residing in the same county as me. 

She lives about 2 hours away: has her mother there with her, but her mother is a senior whose cognitive status is currently questionable (we believe possible early on-set dementia). My niece has expressed to me instances where she has given up trust in childcare duties to her mother (says her mother has let her kids run out the door onto oncoming traffic, dropped them, been unable to help with choking hazards, slow reaction times, etc). I’ve been there offering her support/advice over the phone and text whenever she has reached out. 

I told her I’d be glad to help watch her kids, that there is no need to pay me because we are family- but that I cannot commit to helping her because I may be out of state for my brother’s father in law’s funeral. My brother and his family don’t have a date yet for the funeral (so I haven’t booked plane tickets/made official planet yet), but that I will keep her posted and keep her due date in mind.

My own daughter lives with me and just had a baby a few weeks ago. I help her out with that on top of my full time job. My niece is due in mid-September and says she would pay me to come out, has invited my daughter/her fiancée to stay out at her house as well: says she just wants family support and that her husband’s family can’t afford to fly out from out of state.

Says she knows I won’t accept the money but wants me to have money anyway if it “means the extra support’ but supposed “it’s fine to be alone” and “understand if it’s asking a lot.”

5,1f96tk8,AITA for declining a paid for all-inclusive vacation from my boyfriend’s parents?,"Some background information: Last year I went on an all-inclusive vacation to a 5 star hotel in Cuba. 4 days into the trip, I must have gotten food poising because I became extremely sick. I was stuck in my room for the remainder of the vacation, alternating between vomiting and diarrhea, and my stomach was rejecting every type of food, even snacks we brought from back home. The day we were scheduled to leave, I tried to pay for late check-out but the concierge said it wasn’t possible. The bus was scheduled to pick us up at 8:00pm but check-out was at 11am. They cut our hotel bracelets at check-out and left us stranded without access to even drinks. I had to spend 9 hours in the lobby without A/C, mostly in the public washrooms. After the longest and worst 2 hour bus ride and 5 hour plane ride filling multiple bags of vomit, I was grateful to finally be home. I was still sick for another week at home and lost a total of 10% of my body weight. It was truly one of the most traumatic experiences of my life and I had never been so sick and uncomfortable.

During this time I tried to hide the extent of my suffering to my family and boyfriend because I didn’t want them to worry about me. Fast forward to today, my boyfriend’s parents surprised us all with an all inclusive paid for vacation. Everyone else was extremely excited, thankful, and provided their passport details for booking. I expressed my thankfulness but politely declined due to having a bad experience last time. My boyfriend was upset with me, and said I greatly offended his parents. He said that I am implying his parents chose a cheap hotel that isn’t classy enough for me. I tried to explain to him my point of view but he still insists that I ruined my relationship with his parents.

6,1f96n8j,WIBTA? How do I open this can of worms to my family/husband??? HELP!!,"WIBTA?! I'm not sure where to start, I have never posted before so please take it easy on me!

\*\*Trigger warning SA\*\* I'll start with the fact that I have been happily married to my high school sweetheart for 8 years and we have a beautiful 2 year old daughter. We have been together since we were 16, so 16 years total this year. We know everything about each other and basically grew up together. But there is one deep dark secret that I have never told him, that I didn't think I would need to tell him until recently. I do feel like it is something that I need to bring up because I don't want to put my daughter in the same situation as I was. I need advice to how to bring this up to him and to what extreme. 

Growing up I had a twin brother, and lots of older cousins but the only cousins close to my age were boys. That put me in a situation that at every sleep over it was me and 3 boys. My two cousins were 2 and 3 years older than my brother and I. And I'm not sure at what exact age the abuse started but I have vivid memories around ages 10-15. It was one particular cousin (the one that was 2 years older) that was doing the abuse but the other cousin would text and harass me for pictures at times. My brother would try to step up and stand up for me but was intimidated by the older cousin so the abuse continued. A lot of people hearing this situation would say ""why didn't you tell him to stop"" ""why didn't you tell someone at the time"" etc. but unless you have been in that situation then you don't know. I thought if I spoke up and told my parents, his parents or anyone close they wouldn't believe me. I know my brother was aware to an extent but I'm not sure what extent. I have never talked to anyone about it. I kind of thought I would take this to my grave until, like I said recently. 

  
My daughter also has two older boy cousins, just like I did growing up. One is 3 years older than her and the other 8 years older than her. Recently my in-laws have been making comments to my daughter when we are leaving their house like ""next time the boys come down for a sleep over you will have to come too"" ""you need to come stay the night with the boys and us and we will go to dinner and a movie"". Just hearing those comments takes me right back to when I was being abused and I CANNOT put my daughter knowingly in the same situation. I know if I told my In-laws my concerns about sleep overs with the boys they would say things like... ""O no \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ and \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ would never do something like that"" ""If its a big concern to you we will let her sleep with us"" etc. And maybe making them aware of the concerns would help it not happen, but the abuse for me didn't only happen during the night when the adults were sleeping. There were instances during the day that the adults obviously didn't suspect anything.

My husband and I have covered a lot of topics as far as parenting but we don't see eye to eye on sleepovers. I would like to make our house a no sleepover rule house but he has mentioned just a couple times that everyone he knows with young kids/babies lets them sleep at their grandparents and we haven't. But he also doesn't know the reason I'm nervous about it. I do also still have a case of my first kid syndrome, I haven't spent a night without her and would have a hard time with it. She does go to daycare 5 days a week since I work full time.

But I am posting this now asking for help because I do feel like its time to share my concerns with my husband.  I am just not sure the right way to bring it up to him. I'm nervous how he will react. He was good friends with this said cousin in high school, is he going to call him out on it? Will he not believe me? Will he not support me in my feelings about sleep overs with cousins? Will he think I'm the asshole because I think my nephews might do something like that? I'm really not sure. I would like to think that my husband would believe me (he has no reason not to) and support me but I can't be sure until I tell him. And I'm not going to make myself being nervous about the conversation deter me from telling him. I will NOT put my daughter in a situation that she could possibly be abused. 

So how would others bring this up? My husband and I don't very often if ever have super serious conversations so this would be odd for him. And part of me thinks he might not take me seriously. Or am I an asshole to even think this situation might happen to my daughter? Am I over reacting to the whole thing? I go back and forth in my head weather its worth opening the can of worms, but then I look at my sweet innocent daughter and I can't stomach the possibility of it happening and me knowing it was a possibility. I'm 32 years old and think about it every time my husband and I are intimate. I'm lost... HELP!!

7,1f96k0r,AITA for Telling My Sister Her Child Can’t Play With Mine Due to Behavioral Issues?,"I (32M) have a 6-year-old son, Ethan, while my 29-year-old sister, Laura, has a 5-year-old daughter, Mia. Recently, during our family gatherings, Mia’s behavior has been increasingly disruptive—she runs around wildly, yells, and touches things that aren’t meant to be touched, which often leads to chaos. Ethan, who is more reserved and prefers a quieter environment, has started to feel anxious and uncomfortable around Mia, and he’s mentioned he doesn’t want to play with her anymore. After several stressful gatherings, I decided to talk to Laura about the issue, suggesting that we either find a way to engage Mia more appropriately or have her play in a separate area to minimize disruption for Ethan.

I (32M) have a 6-year-old son, Ethan, while my 29-year-old sister, Laura, has a 5-year-old daughter, Mia. Recently, during our family gatherings, Mia’s behavior has been increasingly disruptive—she runs around wildly, yells, and touches things that aren’t meant to be touched, which often leads to chaos. Ethan, who is more reserved and prefers a quieter environment, has started to feel anxious and uncomfortable around Mia, and he’s mentioned he doesn’t want to play with her anymore. After several stressful gatherings, I decided to talk to Laura about the issue, suggesting that we either find a way to engage Mia more appropriately or have her play in a separate area to minimize disruption for Ethan.

9,1f96gxj,AITA for Refusing my sister to my wedding?,"
I (33M) am getting married in two months and have been planning the day for over a year now. My sister (32F), whom I love dearly, is obsessed with her two dogs. Don’t get me wrong, I love dogs too, but my sister has taken it to the next level. She brings them everywhere—family dinners, holidays, even to restaurants where pets aren’t allowed. If the place says no dogs, she just won’t go.

When I sent out the wedding invitations, I made it clear that it was going to be a dog-free event. We’re getting married at a beautiful estate, and they don’t allow pets for insurance reasons. I assumed my sister would understand this since it’s pretty standard for weddings. However, when I mentioned it to her, she immediately got upset and said if her dogs weren’t invited, then she wouldn’t come either.

She claims that her dogs are like her children, and she can’t imagine a major life event without them. I suggested hiring a dog sitter for the day, but she flat-out refused, saying her dogs have anxiety and can’t be left alone with strangers. I even offered to help find a trusted sitter, but no luck.

Now, she’s telling the rest of the family that I’m being unreasonable and putting her in an impossible situation. Some of my relatives are taking her side, saying I should just allow her to bring them since it’s “just two small dogs.” But I don’t want to deal with pets at my wedding, especially when it’s a formal event, and there are many guests who either aren’t comfortable around dogs or are allergic.

So, AITA for not inviting my sister if she insists on bringing her dogs? UPDATE for the people who keep spamming my Reddit emails.

It took way more relentless bothering than necessary to get her to actually talk to him. Nothing has changed. Now, when he gets urine everywhere, he's actually confronted about it, but his response is always just a dismissive, ""oops."" And then he does it again to no consequence whatsoever.

I know exactly what I should do and tell her boyfriend, but the way she has reacted when I called her out genuinely made me worry about my own safety. We were talking and I told her that she needed to stop what she was doing, and especially stop telling everyone she was cheating, because people were starting to think less of her, and that suddenly her boyfriend would hear it from someone else. I also told her to be honest with her boyfriend, and that he deserves to know. A side of her that I have never seen just bursted out. She started to yell at me for having an opinion on her relationship. I asked why she had told me, and expected me not to have an opinion. She continued saying mean stuff, saying that I thought I was better than her, and her whole demeanor just scared me. She kept on yelling that she hadn’t done anything wrong, and then she just left. I haven’t really talked to her since this was about 5 months ago I think, but whenever I see her she gives me and everyone who’s friends with me nasty looks. The way she acts just scares me, it’s very difficult to describe it when writing. Im scared what she would do if I told her boyfriend the truth. He is a really nice guy, and I feel so bad for him. He is clueless of all this and how is girlfriend is the biggest manipulator of them all. 

Now, I am the only one who has spoken negatively directly to her about this, even though everyone who has mentioned it to me has been incredibly negative about it. If her boyfriend now suddenly finds out I’m sure she would think it was me, even if it wasn’t. She even has her own little minion that she has convinced that she isn’t doing anything wrong, which feeds her ego ridiculously. She even lied to me once and said that they had broken up, which after one conversation with her minion turned out to not be true. 

I can’t stand to look at this anymore, the guilt is almost eating me alive, but I’m so scared of her. She told me once she lit a girls hair on fire because she slept with her now ex boyfriend, which I used to think was a lie but now I’m not sure. I mean that has to
be illegal?? It really makes me wonder how she would react if the roles were reversed now.

I just need some advice. What do I do? Should I just stay out of it, or is there something I could do that wouldn’t make her think I had anything to do with it? Am I an asshole for not saying anything sooner, because I feel like it.

Anyway we’re responsible for contacting the manager of the team that we want to work with next. For the past couple of weeks I’ve been speaking to the past graduates about wanting to join, let’s call it team x. I set up a meeting with the manager of team x where they approved me rotating into their team at the end of the month. I let my own manager know who has helped me organise any learning material or anything else. 

The problem comes where my colleague who’s in the grad program, we’ll call her D. D messaged me to say that she’s also interested in team x but learnt they only take one graduate at a time. I subtly mentioned that I’ve met with the manager of team x and told our manager about it already. I’d like to also mention that D has been involved in these conversations of me talking about wanting to join team x so they’ve know for a while that was my plan. 

D started going on about how her current rotation has prepared them in a way for team x. I feel like she was trying to tell me it was better for her to rotate into team x instead of me. I explained to D that she knows I’ve already had multiple meetings with team x and our manager so I can smoothly adjust to the team so why are they telling me this now.

My inner thoughts: is D expecting me to decide to just “step down”? It took a lot of work for me to convince them to let me join their team so that should go to waste? D can always join the team once I’ve completed 3 months with them but why does she want to do it immediately knowing that I’ve already prepared for it? 

I told D that I was not making the decision to stop working towards working with team x and I’ll leave it up to our manager and the manager of team x because I simply just think it’s not fair for her to put that pressure on me.

28,1f92iuf,AITA for yelling at a stranger?,"This has gnawed at me for a few days, so I thought I'd post it here for clarity.

**Background:** We live in a ground-floor apartment (my partner has severe acrophobia and cannot handle anything else), and while we live in a run-down neighborhood, for the most part it's pretty quiet. We've had problems in our section of the building with tenants selling drugs (that we've reported to management and the police), and occasionally had people banging on our windows at night as they try to find a specific unit. Less offensively (but still bothersome), we've had people walk by on the grass right outside our windows. The area of grass is fairly wide (around 20 feet from the building to the parking lot), so it's not that people *can't* walk farther away from our windows; it really just seems like an active, if rather lazy, choice. We hate it, and feel it's an invasion of our privacy to a fair degree, but we usually only grouse to ourselves about it and leave it at that.

**Story:** Last week I was sitting at my computer in the bedroom listening to music through my noise-cancelling headphones. My back was facing the window, which was open with the curtains drawn. I turned to get up and saw a man standing at my window staring in at me and possibly speaking (I couldn't hear him because of my headphones). I immediately got up and stormed to the window, yelling at him to get away from it. I slammed the window shut, and then started banging on it to tell him to get lost, as I saw him wandering over to our living room window.

I walked quickly to the living room and yelled at him to get away from our windows or I'd call the police, then I slammed the living room window shut and drew the curtains. I then closed the other, smaller window off the living room and drew its curtains, as well as the curtains in the bedroom after that.

**Two important things to mention:**

1. This sort of thing does not happen every day. In fact, to my memory, it's only happened once before (and my partner dealt with it as I was not at home). Usually people will just walk on the grass right outside our windows on their way to other places, paying us no attention.
2. 99% of the time, I'm pretty quiet and even-tempered, and rarely raise my voice to anyone.

I was extremely startled and angry at the intrusion, and reacted very much on instinct. That said, I feel like I could have possibly handled it better if I'd stopped to think about it for a second or two first.

29,1f92ghq,AITA for abandoning my very difficult mother?,"This is my first post on Reddit but I'll try to be quick and professional. I'm a 16 year old female and I've recently made the decision on my own without any outside help to basically abandon my mother. I'm worried that this is just me being a dramatic teenager and that I've hurt my mom beyond belief over nothing, though.

Recently my mother, who is about 45, has become very emotional and aggressive, which I think is normal for a woman of her age and would be fine if it didn't affect me so much. She's done a lot including openly favoring my older brother (for example, letting my brother un-jokingly call all women overly emotional then yelling at me when I jokingly say men are stupid which I don't actually believe), admitting to me that she's much more strict with me because I'm a girl, telling me she wished she never had kids during an argument, never apologizing to me until after I confront her about the problem, and once doing something that my therapist thought warranted a call to CPS (me and my dad managed to convince him not to, though) and more. She also seems to convince herself that everything I dislike and everything I do is purposefully to upset her in some way. Basically acting like a 13 year old girl and treating me like I'm a member of her clique who started dating her ex-boyfriend.

No one in my life who could help actually did, with my dad not really believing me about anything I said and trying to get us to talk it out, which I had been trying to get him to convince her to do. So after a bit I just decided that the next time I had to switch houses (parents are divorced) I just wouldn't, and I would stay with my dad. Of course this made her emotions go through the roof, lots of calls, I stood my ground because I was tired of her. 

It's been a few months now and I'm way happier. She's mellowed out and is much easier to get along with when I'm not stuck in a house with her. She has her moments but it hasn't been bad.

I've felt pretty guilty, though. Around the time I decided to stop going to her house she called me crying and we talked about it but I don't think she understood my decision. I know some of the decisions I've made, like telling my therapist about the event mentioned before, weren't smart on my end and I've exaggerated a bit, but her and her now-husband have been very hostile to me. I still don't know if I'm in the wrong or now, though.

30,1f928k2,AITA for telling everyone that I was serving “a chicken pot pie” for dinner when it wasn’t a plain and basic one?,"So I had a few people over and one of the easiest meals for me to make is a pot pie. To me a pot pie is just whatever you want inside of a crust. Chicken pot pie is usually leftover veggies with a thick gravy and crust. This time around I had fresh roasted hatch chilies and some corn and chicken, onions and kale. So that’s what I put inside, and I used my savory pie crust that has some cheddar and black pepper.

When I served it however I guess it really pissed off my brother in law Frank who immediately started complaining asking “what the fuck is this” and “how is this a pot pie.” I told him it’s a pot pie and explained what I said above. He tried to argue that “a chicken pot pie shouldn’t have anything other than chicken, gravy, peas, carrots, and maybe potatoes.”

I said ok well sorry, I don’t really see food in black and white. No one said they had any allergies or issues with food so I didn’t think it would be an issue. He kept on scowling and pushed around the food and eventually left early. 

Am I the asshole? In my family we really never kept recipes as hyper specific. We cook and eat what we have. I guess I figured most families were the same and that it’s just people on the internet who make a big deal out of recipes.

31,1f926hd,AITA for not reimbursing the groom for a tip made on behalf?,"We go to a destination wedding in the Carribean. Our family arrives early to stay for a total of 8 days.



There is a beach bar. It couldn't be more convenient. The food is average and expensive, but I will pay for convenience on vacation. We get in the habit of mostly just eating here. With food for the family and alcohol I'm running up a $200-$300 tab daily.



They close early. 8pm. And 8pm really means 7:50. at 7:30 the staff is focused on cleaning up, busing tables, etc. There are often customers alone at the bar waiting to be helped because the staff is prioritizing closing duties so they can hit the door at 7:59:59. This is a daily thing. They will lean the chairs up against the tables beginning at 7:30 to discourage people from sitting down. They also open late daily.



The night of the wedding comes. I have been drinking most of the day and am admittedly drunk. Previously I had a conversation with the bartender about the wedding and asking them how long they were going to keep frozen drinks going because they have been shutting it down early every day. They told me 7:30.



7:05 the night of the wedding they closed the frozen drinks. I said ""hey, what happened to 7:30?"". He shrugs his shoulders and said ""Island Time"". I then asked him if that meant they were running late or early or both? They seemed to open late and close early. The discussion got more heated when he said he had to get home. I told him that if getting home at a decent time was important to him, he was in the wrong line of work and should get a ""real job.""



That pissed him off, and rightfully so. We argued a bit about how to run a business and appreciate customers. I ended up apologizing for being a dick (The ""get a real job"" comment was out of line), ordered a beer and closed out my tab (tipped a full 15%). I thought it was over.



5mins later wedding planner comes up to me. She tells me that she heard there was a problem at the bar. She said that sometimes people from the states aren't happy with the service. I end up getting into an argument with her. I think I said something along the lines of ""we are all spending thousands of dollars here this week and your buddy can't be bothered to wait on cleaning a blender until the guests leave? Give me a fucking break.""



Then the groom comes up to me. Tells me I have been ""cut off"" (I closed my own tab 15mins ago) and that the wedding planner told him I ""cussed her out"" and that I need to settle down so I don’t ruin the night



I cannot believe they are bothering the groom with this nonsense, so I went straight to the bar and started ""mother fucking"" them pretty good. ""You motherfuckers' embarrassed me and made a scene!"" etc



They tell me I am banned for life. I tell them all to go fuck themselves and leave. The groom decides he will tip them $50 each for the trouble. He then tells me I need to reimburse him the next day.

It was really gross, so I didn’t want to wash them in our home laundry washing machine & I told myself I’d take care of it by deep cleaning them in a laundry mat sometime with the appropriate chemicals (baking soda to get rid of the odor, etc). Maybe I’m weird, but I’m super picky with clothes & was so happy to finally have a pair of favorite jeans I finally felt confident in so I wanted to at least TRY saving them.

i'm a good student and i have so many hobbies that i'm really good at but no one around me sees me for those things and comments only on my body and each time i get upset i get yelled at.

 i'm not even that fat, i just have a chubby figure and it shows a lot since i'm 170 cm which makes me sometimes look huge compared to other girls, my classmates tell me that i look fine and attractive even but each time they say that i can never believe them and feel like i want to crawl out of my own body.

Each time i do something i get a comment on my body, if we are out and i ask for food first i get told off but if it's my sister then it's fine, when we walk long distances everyone has the right to say that they're tired but if i say so, my dad just tells me to endure it if i wanna lose weight.

I (26F) have a cousin, Mia (29F?), and the last two years my husband and I have gotten super close to her, her son, and her fiance. She is engaged to Tom (33M?) and they have been together for 3-4 years.

Last time we hung out was about a month ago, and they had just adopted a 10yr old small dog, I'll call Powder. They also currently have another younger dog, but my cousin told us she wanted to give Powder a good home for his last few years as he was a rescue. The two dogs got along. 

Fast forward we hung out this past weekend and when I noticed Powder wasn't around. When I asked, Mia told me that Powder had been eaten by coyotes. Mia was out of town on business, and Tom was at work. He left the dogs outside, although usually they're inside, and when he got home Powder was gone. The reason they said coyotes was because coyotes do roam the area and they have a low fence in the backyard that faces some undeveloped land and where the coyotes live. I ""scolded"" Tom because I really loved Powder, but I dropped it because if he was at work pos ni modo. Lo que paso paso. It wasn't brought up again the rest of the night. 

Well, fast forward to Sunday and my husband and I decide to trip acid. No, this isn't the first time we done it, and we were in the safety of our own home. Well, we ended up having a bad trip and my husband is spiraling. He swears he's going to jail, he swears the law is outside and is going to take him away. For over an hour I'm struggling to calm him down until I finally just take him outside to prove there is nobody there. Well, after all of it, he breaks down and come clean. 

This last time we hung out with them, Tom admitted to him what really happened. Apparently, Tom came home (he didn't say from where), and the dogs were barking outside. Apparently, he just couldn't handle it and went to take a breather. He didn't say how long he left thr dogs outside for, but soon all he heard was their younger dog barking. When he went outside, he saw Powder in the coyotes mouth. There wasn't anything he could do. My husband though he was joking, so he admitted he laughed, but apparently Tom said, ""Yeah it's funny in a fucked up way. You know it's something only men can laugh at."" Then he admitted to not telling Mia because it would ""make things worse between them"". The only two thay know is my husband and Tom's bestfriend.

I immediately felt the need to tell Mia because if I was in her shoes, I would want to know. However, there are two outcomes to this and I'm nervous. One, she could break up with Tom over this and I know she'll be heartbroken. Or, she stays with him and they cut us off. I spoke to my mom.who first told me not to tell her, and just keep an eye on Tom in case anything else happens. I said no, because if something else does happen AND THEN I admit to knowing about Powder how will she trust me? I wouldn't trust me if I did that. 

So, I'm conflicted. I'm supposed to meet with her tonight, but I'm second guessing myself. Please help.  


Edit: I met with my cousin and we talked. A lot of you were right, obviously, telling her was the only solution. 

She wasn't mad at me or my husband, she did thank me for being honest and said she and my nephew have been crying for the last week about her dog. This whole week she asked Tom if he was sure that Powder was killed because accorrding to Tom he didn't find blood, which made Mia suspicious and think that maybe Powder just got out, or maybe was picked up by someone. She called shelters and even wanted to put up posters.

 I apologized she had to find out this way, but she's more upset that he lied and didn't tell her and instead watched her and my nephew cry the last week all while claiming he doesn't really know if the dog was taken or not. But then also saying to several other people, including her sister, that the dog was taken. So he was giving a conflicting story to her and others.

A few days went by and it was fine, but then he didn't travel due to renewing his travel documents. I told him to move his ticket to another date, so the ticket wouldn't be lost, he stopped answering messages and calls again. This is with a brand new phone.

44,1f8zyyf,AITA for telling my friend that he can't bring a kid to my birthday party?,"I (29m) and my twin brother had our birthday party last Saturday. We had planned a week in advance to have it at our parent's place as our own place doesn't have enough space for family and close friends to cram into. My mother was cooking our favorite meal and was looking for a head count so she could know how much to cook. 

Friday evening, we went to a backyard party of one of the friends (let's call him Brad, 29m) that was coming to our party. Another friend named Jim (27m) had just started living with him a week before. Brad's name is the only one on the lease. We both had known Brad and Jim since highschool.

 Jim's girlfriend Jess (23f), who we've only known for about a month is also living there and she brought her little brother (maybe 9-10) that she calls her surrogate son because their mother neglected them. Brad has expressed his feelings that he doesn't want a kid living in the house and that he was not told that the kid would be staying there. 

Fast forward to Saturday's party at my parent's, my brother and I are having a drink with some of the friends that showed up and family. Jim and Jess are one of the last ones to arrive and I see Jess' little brother hop out of the truck. I go inside and tell my brother. He gets up and tells Jim that he can't just bring other people to the party without telling us, even though it was just one extra person. As he does this I'm with the rest of the group so I didn't see if Jess and her brother were in earshot. My mom tells us that he can come in but he's not her responsibility to take care of him. 

We had been drinking and smoking weed outside, playing some backyard games when Jim tells us he's going to go home with Jess and her brother. They had been there for maybe an hour. I ask him if he was going to come back at all and he said maybe. Jim and Jess never showed up again to the party and I haven't talked to them since. I understand that they had gotten the feeling that they weren't welcome but that wasn't the case. It was the fact that they brought a kid to a party knowing full well that there would be booze and drugs and that they didn't tell us beforehand. 

So our my brother and I the asshole for expressing out feelings to our friend that his girlfriend's little brother wasn't invited to our party?

Edit: Jess probably smokes the most out of everyone that was at the party. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but to bring a child to a party where that was all happening to begin with is insane. I also didn't know how long they planned to stay if we didn't say something to them. They most likely thought that we'd be fine with it.

50,1f8yzkj,AITA for trying to talk my roommate’s gf out of going to Universal’s Horror Nights with us ,"My roommates and I have planned a trip to go to HHN. Two of my roommates have gf’s and have decided to bring them. The problem is one of my roommate’s (Cade 22m) gf’s (Lucy 21f) is actually kind of a baby about this stuff and I feel like she’s going to ruin the whole trip. 

For example, last October we went to a local haunted house and Lucy was freaked out the entire time. She screamed at everything and had her face buried in Cade the entire time so she couldn’t even see what she was screaming at. Literally, she was just screaming at noises.

Shes the type who leaves hallway lights on at night or just “has” to stay over after a scary movie because she won’t be able to sleep alone. I’ve even heard her say that she doesn’t enjoy haunted houses or scary movies but will make herself endure it just so she can do things with Cade.

If it was just another local haunted house I honestly wouldn’t have said anything but Universal is a BIG /expensive trip for us. I don’t want the trip ruined when Lucy inevitably starts having some form of a panic attack. Yes, an actual panic attack is an exaggeration of her behavior but you get the idea.

I also don’t want our group to separate as my friend’s are funny which makes the experience more fun with them than without. So that means if Lucy starts dragging her feet we have to wait on her.

Recently, the topic of HHNs came up & I took the opportunity to suggest maybe it would be a good idea for Lucy not to come since she doesn’t do well with horror. She didnt get the hint and said she wanted to come with Cade. I said we’d only be gone for a couple of days so it might be better for their peace of mind if she sat this one out. That was when Cade chimed in and said he wanted her to come.

I said I get it, but they see each other nearly everyday anyways and the trip really isn’t going to be great for anyone given her track record with these sorts of things. We said a few more things & she ended saying “idk it’s up to Cade” to which he just reiterated that he wanted her to come and asked why was I picking on his gf. 

I said I wasn’t picking on her, I was just pointing out the truth & I wanted this trip to be enjoyable for everyone. Since we’d be back in 3 days I didn’t think it’d be a big deal.

Cade said that Lucy didn’t act any different from any other girl at HHN’s to which I replied that there are plenty of girl’s who do not scream and cower at every pop up and again, I’m just wanting to make this trip fun. 

He said some do some don’t, it shouldn’t be a big deal either way since I’m not responsible for anyone but myself. I know that, but having to wait on Lucy getting catered to bugs me. We shared a few more words but I ended up just saying okay bc I didn’t want an argument to cancel the trip.

52,1f8yr60,AITA - For not bowing to my husbands family and forcing him to make nice with them,"A quick summary. My husband (29m) has been through more in life than anyone should ever have to and it all began with his biological family. He was raised by his grandmother from the age of 2 because his mother was/is a meth addict who to this day thinks her needs are far more important than her children's'. She's had two children removed from her care as an adult and the two she got to keep have been so emotionally crippled by her obsessive coddling that they'll probably never be functioning members of society. Since Grandma was basically a single parent to her grandson he spent a long time as a latch key kid in Stockton California. I know she did the absolute best she did over the years, but it doesn't mean that everything was done right. Granted that can be said about any parent can't it?

Fast forward to this year....we've of course had a lot of ups and downs with his family, but despite my better judgment we always at least tried to play nice so he could maintain an relationship with his younger siblings. That is until a couple years ago when his mother tried to get him to take the fall for some very illegal activities that I won't go into too much depth because it's still an issue. This resulted in him 100% cutting off all contact with her and most of his family who thought he should ""Get over it"" and just forgive her. The activities that she tried to get him to take the fall for could have potentially landed him in prison for about ten years but that apparently doesn't matter. Anyways...he's had a tense relationship with the little bit of family he was still interacting with and that came to an end ever an aunt and uncle got drunk and berated him to his face about all the perceived ways he's a screw up so he went no contact with them as well.

Grandma tried to get into the middle of it, but when she refused to accept that the only thing he wanted was an in person face to face apology he cut her off too. He's just tired of being the whipping boy when they have a bad day and being expected to just get over it. Now once again they're in town....a cousin is getting married this weekend so grandma calls me to tell me I need to force him to interact with them. I'm his wife not his boss so I'm not about to shove him into an interaction he doesn't want and I told her so. I even told her all he wanted was that apology and to be treated like an adult but that I would talk to him. Her response....verbatim ""Don't bother. Let him pout. We'll see you next time."" So I got mad. And I told her that I don't know how things are done in the place they're from but that's now how I was raised and clearly my parents did a better job since at least I understand basic human respect. So now she's blowing up my phone saying I'm an asshole and that she wishes her grandson had never met me. So am I the one in the wrong for supporting him in not wanting to talk to them or should I try to talk him into making nice?

Edit: To add a list of the things my husband has been ""Disowned"" for in the last 6 years by his mother who chose an 8 ball and $400 over her two year old son.

1. Taking his mother to the hospital for another ""emergency"" while he was with me and taking me with him to help him understand what the doctors were saying. He then insisted that her husband (Who did not know she'd gone to the hospital) be the one to pick her up after the doctor assured us she was fine
2. Refusing to have his stepfather whom he has no relationship with as the best man in our wedding
3. Refusing to demand a promoter for an event he was participating in pay for an extra room for his brother to go with us. On top of that how dare he point out that I go and sleep in the same bed as him because duh...She then refused to go to the event unless we paid for her to go.
4. Him thanking my parents (who bought their own tickets and booked their own hotel room) and I for being there to support him at that same event...which was 4 hours away from home.
5. Refusing to give my ticket out of a pair he won on the radio to a concert to his brother as a  birthday present and then refusing to buy an additional ticket that was out of our budget. (It was Five Finger Death Punch, Megadeath, Fire From the Gods, and The Hu....it was awesome.)
6. Him asking if they would be able to help pay for the rehearsal dinner, then when they said they couldn't, him and I paying for it out of our own pocket and insisting it was okay.
7. Him refusing to allow his mother and siblings to talk to me in any way that he perceived as disrespectful.
8. Him telling her that in the event that we have a child that she does not have rights we are obligated to honor in regards to that child.
9. Not covering for her when she drove while under the influence

Advice needed, AITA:

My (f) family member made an appointment for me at a complimentary care guy for the same day. I went as I know it would lead to a fight if I don't go. I technically had to work, but I worked from home so I could take a 2 hour leaver.
I had to promise to give it a fair change so I did (in the end worst case it can't hurt).

I went there felt pretty uncomfortable as it started out with him smoking two sigarets in my face (which I thought was very unprofessional), so when he lit the 2nd one I kindly requested him to not smoke. Because I have problems with back pain he decided to do something to my lower back (without warning me), which hurt like hell and was very different than what my physician does. But he promised it is part of the healing process. Afterwards I had to relax/sleep on a doctor's table, and with shaking hands all over my face he was sending healing energy towards me. If I was alone, I would have quit and complained to be uncomfortable early on, but because my family member was with me, I felt forced to go through it all as openminded as I am.

Now I have a big pain in my back, am nautious got trouble peeing and feel overall shit. I got kinda frustrated with that, especially since I needed to fly 8 hours in 3 days. I went to work after coming home, but couldn't concentrate and out of frustration threw an empty water bottle on the floor, and now she is very angry with me. At that time I am too confused and frustrated to decide who I am angry at, but I am clearly visible frustrated, not being able to finish my work due to the pain, and wondering what to do when flying.

I do appreciate the effort of sending me to this guy, as some family members I have, are feeling happy with him, and I would never go to this kind of guy if not forced. So I am not necessarily angry at my family member, but I am confused and frustrated. Because I threw the empty water  bottle back home, she decided I am unthankful and gives me the silent treatment. 

Next day I decided to bring it up, as now I am angry at her after frustration build up and thought it was a good idea to not let it linger, as now we are both mad ad each other.

My mom forgot about me or my sister and preferred Jason. It also meant she had minimal contact with her grandchildren when she favored him. 

My father, who lost that home in a divorce, said it wasn’t fair that Jason inherited everything from my mom. My father suddenly passed away, and Jason was kept out of his will because my dad was still sour about what my mom did. 

Jason was shocked when he was left out of my dad’s will. He said the property tax on my mom’s house was late because he was planning to use the money from Dad's inheritance, which was a dirty trick Dad pulled on him. 

My sister Debbie already told Jason to get a fucking job, and maybe he will have the 7k by the time it’s due. I’m also not giving Jason shit. It’s how my dad wanted it. 

Jason was freaking out during the reading because he didn’t get anything, and he’s already going through most of my mom’s money and hasn’t worked in 5 years since her death. 

He called us all assholes and said he needed the money more than us. I’m sure this was the same line he used on my mom to get Debbie and me written out of my mom’s will.

Jason acts like he will fight the will, but my dad talked about how Jason got 100% of my mom’s inheritance; he doesn’t get anything. On top of my dad’s insurance, Debbie and I are going to sell my dad’s home, and hopefully, the market stays hot. I suggest to my brother that he do the same thing and take the money and downsize to a smaller apartment or home. 

My brother is ranting to anyone who will listen, calling us selfish assholes, and even setting up a GoFundMe for his taxes. Several family members have donated. 

My grandma (on my mom’s side) has reached out to me to help him with the taxes, and I said no. My grandma said she is no longer going to leave Debbie and me anything now because of how we treated our brother, but I reminded my grandma that our mom (her daughter) started this, and no one threw a fit about it when mom died. Debbie had two small children then and could have used the money.

After dinner my girlfriend said she’d put the soup away, I saw she had it portioned in containers still cooking but I wrongly assumed she would put them in the fridge as I went upstairs to shower.
Fast forward to this morning I see all the containers sitting on the counter. When I ask if they were left out she said “yes they were too hot to put in the fridge and they’re fine”. I responded by saying “this isn’t safe and I won’t be eating them”.
It ended with her heading to work saying she’s never had a problem and her dumping the soup. And I feeling like I’m TA because this ain’t the first time it feels like our values aren’t aligning and I need to fight my trauma response to not allow help and just do and double check everything.
Finally, I realize this is a big issue not only because of my own worry about food after and getting food poisoning. But because my mom has a history of leaving food out and spoiling and wasting.

So I (28F) live away from where I grew up. I grew up low income and first gen.

A little over two years ago I cut her off financially it was reaching a point where I was feeling genuinely unsafe in our dynamic. In these two years, we’ve had some significant family deaths that have hit me financially, so I have not been able to use time to build back up the money that I lost while helping her, However I have been able to clear out all of my debts!  But at this point I’m living paycheck to paycheck because I’m working at a job that’s under paying me but I’m very close to getting another job that’s paying me significantly more where I can finally start to save. Of course now my mother is back to being unemployed and is drowning financially and I’m at a point where I just don’t think it’s smart for me to help her, but she is drowning.

58,1f8yb6f,AITA for yelling at a dad and then him forced his child to quit the sport I'm coaching?,"This happend a year ago and some acquaintances told me I was an asshole as I was telling them the story, so here we are to the court of public opinion.

Backstory: I am 21, I coach and teach children sailing since I was 15. I have 13 years of experience in sailing and I've competed many times in national and international level as a teen. I have my lifeguard certification and I also have licence to drive motorboat. English is not my first language, so sorry for the mistakes.Enjoy!

We are the only sailing club in the area I'm in and one day I am the only coach there. That day we had only two kids about 10 yo, Ben and Nick. Ben's dad, Terry 50, really wanted to try sailing and since there wasn't much air, I agreed. 

I was on the motorboat alone when suddenly fuel didn't get to the engine causing me to be no better than a floating ball. I call over the children and Terry to give them instructions until help arrives.

Terry doesn't follow my instructions because his son is telling him to try different things. That causes Terry to capsize. After about half an hour help arrives and takes us all to shore.

Then Terry starts telling me that I am careless and he doesn't trust me and I've put their lives at risk because "" I am just a kid who doesn't know what they are doing and his son knows better than me"" 

I *kindly* reminded him that everything his son knows has learnt it from me and I don't understand why he as the adult didn't follow my instructions and instead listened to a child.

He started yelling at me that I am the reason he got wet and he put his life at risk and said that it was my incompetence that made the boat stop working and that I wouldn't know about that because I am just a dumb kid and he knows better.

Then I lost it. I told him something along the lines of ""how the hell in your fist day you know more that me that I've been in this sport my whole life"" etc.

He started screaming about how my incompetence got him wet and that I've insulted him.

64,1f8xbaj,AITA for not inviting his cousins to our wedding ceremony after they told him not to marry me?,"Gut check here. I (38F) am planning to marry my fiance (40M) in a few months.  His parents and only brother are all deceased, so his closest family are his first cousins- 4 sisters from a living Aunt and Uncle and a bro/sis combo from a deceased uncle.  He is part of a larger extended family of cousins with a long history in our country; lots of family money, lineage, land and (dare I say for some) entitlement.   He's been through a lot and I am in love with his kindness, resiliency and his good heart.

We live in his grandparents estate home, which his cousins and aunt call the family homestead. Everyone feels it's ok to walk into our home unannounced because they grew up doing that. I can't tell you how many times I have walked around a corner and found his aunt (in her 80's) IN MY HOME! We are working together on getting his family to understand that this might be the family house, but it is our HOME and they need to respect that.

With that background, here's the dilemma. Last week, two of his female cousins came to visit and went on a walk through the grounds with my finance without me.  On this walk, they sat him down and told him to not marry me. That they think I am manipulative and controlling and only after his money. They suggested we have the ceremony and party but not mail in the marriage license, so it's not official or legal. They wrapped this conversation up with ""we care about you and are only looking out to for you so that's why we are saying this.""

He was so shocked at their words, their audacity and gall, that he froze and didn't really say anything.  He wrapped up their visit and told me all about it after they left.  I was and still am hurt and stunned.  They have always been nice to me and never once indicated they didn't like me or didn't think I was good for him.

We are having a wedding soon, with a small gathering for our ceremony/vows (less than 40 people) and then later in the same day, a party for 300.  I REALLY don't want these women at my wedding ceremony; they ARE invited to the celebration party.   He is conflicted because they are his closest family and feels like this one conversation shouldn't negate the years of relationship they all have.  We are inviting his aunt and uncle and the other first cousins to the ceremony.

Day before yesterday (before my 2nd week of work) I lost my purse while at a parade with my bf- with my phone and keys inside it. Eventually my bf called my phone and talked to a man who found my things and arranged for it to be dropped off at his house for safety.

When he came over to my apartment afterward to give my purse to me, he told me he gave the man $100 dollars for his trouble and asked to be reimbursed from me. I wish he had checked in with me before acting- bc when I expressed surprise, he said the man had driven in from Staten Island to Manhattan and although the man protested and said he didn't expect any reward, or need any payment my bf ""felt bad for his troubles"" and insisted.

A part of me feels weird bc my bf didn't check in about offering an award, and while I understand his logic, I really don't have the budget right now- it will take me a full day's work to pay back this man, so I wouldn't have offered a reward if he had insisted he simply wanted to ""do the right thing""- not bc an award is not deserved, but bc I truly can't afford it right now.

At first when my bf told me about giving the man a reward, he mentioned splitting the amount between us, and me ""paying him back"" $50 but when I asked again, he requested the full $100. WIBTA if I pushed back and said if he couldn't afford to give the man an award he shouldn't have offered? It also feels weird to me he didn't check in before he decided to give out money but a part of me feels like I'm being a bit petty and difficult. After all, I am thankful my purse is back and I do think rewards for doing the right thing are deserved... But at the same time, I feel weird. Why did my bf offer and expect me to simply reimburse him? Why insist on paying a reward to someone who didn't want one if he couldn't afford it and knows I can't either?

WIBTA for telling him I just don't think I should have to reimburse him? AITA for thinking I wouldn't have offered an award in the first place? I can see how someone not offering a reward or not wanting to pay back my bf when he did the right thing could be seen as me being the asshole.

EDIT: talked with him about it, and am paying it in installments from each paycheck. I still feel feel weird about it, bc I would *never* offer someone money on his behalf when I know he's struggling financially and before his first paycheck at a new job when I'm gainfully employed... and if I did, I'd probably never ask to be reimbursed bc it was my call in the first place. I guess it's handled, so, I'll just bite the bullet. 

It is what it is. Thanks for the advice!

66,1f8w1fu,AITA for asking my boyfriend to hang out with my friends after he said he doesn’t want to,"AITA for being upset with my boyfriend because he won’t try to hang out with my friends 

I (25 F) asked my boyfriend (25 M) if he would go out with some old friends of mine and their boyfriends/husband as I am trying to rekindle the friendships and they are either married or have kids with their SO’s and would most likely bring them along. We normally hang out with his friends because I don’t mind and get along with them and we also spend time with our friends alone as we think it is healthy to still be able to have separate social lives. I wouldn’t mind hanging out with them alone but we have been together for about 9 years now and they only know him from high-school and vice versa. I know they aren’t really “his vibe” but he won’t even try to hang out with them just to go to dinner or something. He told me he isn’t gonna have fun and knows he won’t enjoy it.

67,1f8w0om,"AITAH for telling my uncle off, and not saying sorry,after he disrespected my family?","To summarize the issue I’m 19m and my uncle and the other 3 siblings besides my mom live far away from my grandparents. Grandparents have a ranch near where I live for college. My family as in my brothers, dad, and I take care of said ranch because my grandparents are just not in the shape the used to be anymore. It’s a hunting ranch, with a nice house on it aswell. Uncle and siblings that live about a hour away hardly visit expect when it’s convenient to them to see their parents. This weekend uncle came down for a big football game, and decided to bring friends out to the ranch. When he got there he found that the AC had malfunctioned and spilled water everywhere. Causing one of the rooms to flood and some other issues. He found some alcohol that was definitely left by me in the fridge. Uncles wife then decides to send a text to the Adult family group chat, calling out my family and my parents. Basically saying that my family ruins everything for them and they couldn’t even have one weekend at the ranch without my family ruining it. Along with some more things about how my parents can not and don’t know how to parent. I have 2 older brother and 2 younger sisters and we are by far the oldest family as I don’t have a cousin within 4 years of me and my uncles oldest kid is 12.

Uncle leaves ranch and goes to grandparents house, where my sister is. (Grandma has COPD and multiple other issues, bed bound) uncle and his wife are frustrated that grandma won’t punish me, because of the alcohol that was left, calling me a drunk. Grandma starts having issues breathing and my sister steps in and says that my grandma can’t handle the argument. Uncle goes completely off on my sister and what my grandma and sister are calling borderline abusive yelling and screaming at her because she’s not an adult and shouldn’t step into adult issues. 

I am working and when I do hear about the issues I lost it. I texted my uncle a strongly worded text about how I am an adult and my actions do not reflect my parents. And if he or his wife have issues with me they need to text me. Along with me telling him that he needs to visit and help more around the ranch if he even wants to put input into how the house is kept. Uncle says my text was super disrespectful and claims he won’t come down anymore endlessly I apologize. 

I value family more than anything, but I refuse to say sorry to him till I see or hear an apology from him to my mother, father, sister, grandparents. And he fills that I should apologize first because I am lower than him and therefore disrespecting him but I will not.

68,1f8w0mu,AITA for pointing out my dad's failing marriage when he pointed out my acne for the 100th time,"For context: My mom and dad have always had issues with each other for as long as I can remember, mainly my dad with my mom. They never get along. But to be fully honest i've always resented them for being the main reason why I have a bad view on relationships. For example I hesitate to fully believe my friends when they say their parents hug or kiss or whatever. Like I'll know it's true, but I just genuinely can't picture it because it goes against everything from what i've seen. I'm honestly just so sick of it. Yes this is relevant to the story.

I love my mom but I have a lot of issues with my dad that I'm not going to get into here. The issue this post is about is that my (16f) dad (50m) has a habit of pointing out my acne (or anything else really). It's not even that much, I'm not wildly insecure about it or anything but it gets to the point where it's just fucking annoying. Like I'll be doing my homework and Dad will find me and say ""make sure to wash your pimples!!!"" ""You have a new pimple on your chin, you know?"" ""You need to stop eating so much junk foods, you have pimples on your cheek"" annoying remarks like that that don't serve any real purpose. For the last few months I've just been ignoring them, thinking that if he doesn't get a reaction then he'll stop but surprise surprise he hasn't!

Well yesterday I was in a horrible mood and I was in my room and I wanted to be left alone. my dad comes in the room to bring me water, nice enough, but then he has to make another shitty comment about my acne. ""Your acne is so noticeable today!"" I was just exhausted and pissed to begin with, and now he intruded my personal space. Without thinking I just came up with a snappy remark. This is word for word what I said: ""If my acne is so noticeable then you should also be able to notice your failing marriage and leave my mom already."" typing it out now, I just feel even more bad. He was pissed, and as much as I don't like him, I understand why.

I honestly think I got the failing marriage comment from how I'm just so sick of them always in their issues. Not only is it hard to watch as their child, but it's just plain annoying to watch their constant petty disagreements. I think from being so exhausted my subconcious decided to finally voice my true feelings lol.

Please tell me if this remark was too far because I'm genuinely still mortified after saying that comment. AITA?

Edit: Thank you guys for commenting. I definitely agree that I could have taken a different approach but I'm glad that many of you were sympathetic. I enjoyed reading all of the comments, some of them cheered me up and some made me laugh lol. Some comments mentioned a derm so I should address that. My mom wants to take me to a derm but my dad is very much against it, I personally have always wanted to go but I don't want to make more conflict for now especially after this incident. Since it's not extremely severe, I think I want to just hold off on it until we're in a place to discuss that as a family. I do want to apologize and I'll do it when i'm ready, probably in a few days.

69,1f8vzed,AITA? Did I make it a party all about me?,"Me and my friend (S) had a double bday airbnb last weekend. She says it was because I made the party all about me, ruined her time and I did not care about her. 
1. My bf was also there, she said I made it into just our vacation. Because we were just doing our own thing and not being with the group.
The first day out own thing entailed getting in a hot tub for 10 minutes. I went out for a smoke by myself for 10 minutes. Next day I can admit that once we were upstairs in our room for a bit too long while they were partying. We were fucking, but it was honestly like 30 mins. I apologized for this. I was not away for hours. I had took too much of an edible before hand, so as we were heading toward the group afterwards I was getting really high, uncomfortably high. I tried to stay with the group, but the music, lights, games were too much for me so I went back to my room. I made a mistake with the edible. I was with the group all night the first day, the second day I was incapacitated. 
2. Everyone was waiting on me like “they always do”.
The third day after the edible situation I was tired. I woke up that morning, got some donuts for everyone. But everyone was still sleep. Today we planned on going this arcade place. When everyone else woke up I was getting tired again. I said I’d take a nap for a little then we can go. I didn’t think this would be such a problem. After my nap, I text S telling her im about to get ready. She says it’s canceled and she left going over her sisters house. She didn’t even tell me, she just left. If I didn’t text her even now she wouldn’t have said anything. On top of that she went to this food place we were supposed to go together without saying anything.
3. I did not care about her.
S was upset from the very beginning. I saw she had a problem and I asked her multiple times throughout the weekend what was wrong. She did not give me an answer and shrugged it off. I assumed why she was upset but I still wanted to hear it from her and just talk about it so we could fix it. The times I was with the group, she wasn’t there mentally. She would be on her phone and literally silent. She was not approachable, so instead me trying to figure it out repeatedly, I left her alone. She was upset because I wasn’t around. I feel like I was around and I wasn’t just with my bf all day. Id say she felt like I wasn’t around was because of the nap, but I wasn’t the one who canceled the plans, nor was there a specific time we were supposed to go it was just whenever. I even had more ideas on what we could do afterwards. When I was around she was disconnected. At some point I stopped trying to talk to S because I wasn’t getting any answers or engagement. 
I know I made some stupid mistakes and I’ve apologized for them. My intention wasn’t to ruin it, if anything I wanted her to have fun with us too. Could I have done more to fix things?

72,1f8v5va,AITA for calling my friend a horrible person,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for an unbiased perspective on a situation with my former friend, Sa. I (17F) was friends with Sa (18F) for over two years after she came to my school, and we were in the same friend group.

Last year, I started talking to a guy on her roster (they had never met) when he asked why Sa had blocked him. I asked her, and she said there was no reason, which I told him. A couple of months later, Sa is in a relationship, and the guy and I start talking. He asks me to meet up, and I thought he was fun, so I wasn’t against it. Before agreeing, I asked Sa if she’d be okay with it and said I’d stop talking to him if she wasn’t. She gave me the green light, so I met him, but nothing came of it.

About a month later, during exam week, I hear from a mutual friend that my group has been calling me names like “wh0r3” and “copycat,” saying I’m a horrible person. I (1) bawl my eyes out in the mall and (2) call each person to confront them, including Sa, who apologized. I also found out Sa didn’t mention I’d asked for her permission before meeting the guy. Despite this, I stayed friends with the group and kept eating lunch with them.

I’m invited to Sa’s birthday party and have a great time. There, I end up talking with her boyfriend’s best friend, P. We weren’t flirting, just bonding over people being too loud. Everyone teased us since we’re different. A month passes, and P and I meet up a few times. Eventually, he asks me to be his girlfriend (in my native language). I reject him because I’m scared of commitment, but a week later, I confess, and we get together.

However, between my rejection and us getting together, Sa messages him saying she never liked me, that I’m crappy in relationships (this would’ve been my first), and that I used my friend group to get what I want. She said everyone hates me now and that I use them for guys and a social life. I get screenshots of this and rant to my best friends, crying about it. I then stop talking to Sa but stay in touch with the rest of the group.

Later, I’m invited to her boyfriend’s party because I’m dating his best friend. At the party, I find out (1) she’s still talking badly about me, and (2) my group had a party, and I was the only one not invited (the FOMO was insane). Upset, I end up not sober in a bathroom where Ss is too. She asks how I am, and I say not great, bringing up the party and asking why she’s been talking about me when we haven’t spoken for over a month. I ask what I did wrong for her to dislike me, asking for examples of when I acted badly enough for her to say I have “main character syndrome.” She didn’t say anything about that.

Instead, she said I talked shit about her, which, to be fair, I did, but I said I was just telling the truth since she’s a horrible person. I’m bringing this up because it’s not a black-and-white situation. I did wrong, and so did she, but I just need some outside perspective on whether I’m the asshole here.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-04,"AITA for calling my friend a horrible person Hi everyone, I’m looking for an unbiased perspective on a situation with my former friend, Sa.

73,1f8uwvm,AITA for not inviting my friend to my bday after she left me on delivered for a month.,"
A month ago I sent out invitations to my 6 closest friends for my bday dinner. All of them replied within a day…but this one friend. My dinner is fast approaching (in 2 days) and she only now replied. I thought that she would not reply anyways because there has been a similar situation before, so I changed the reservation to avoid any additional charges. 

This is how she replied to my invitation (note: only today, exactly a month later after i sent the invitation)
“Perfect thank you, I’ll be there!💕”
To which I replied:
“perfiee thanks for letting me know but I did already change the reservation bcs I was not expecting you to reply (i’ll sort it out) but before i do i would lowkey like to meet w u bcs i was thrown off by you basically ghosting me for weeks.”
She Replied with:
“Oh okay… I don’t want this to be a hassle for you. Do you maybe want to meet for brunch on Saturday. Lmk so i can arrange something.”
(Note: Saturday would be after my bday and therefore no time to speak it over)
After that I replied telling her that it would be inconvenient for me to meet for brunch and that she can come to my bday dinner (bcs i was scared she’d get mad).
Her last message was:
“Are you sure? I understand if you don’t aha x” 

What bothers me now is that she never apologized for her actions and basically ignored what annoyed me. 
Now should I invite her or tell her that I thought it was extremely disrespectful how she handled the situation and interacted with me? Any advice is welcome! Thanks guys! 

EDIT: I realized that i forgot to mention that within that month I texted her 2 other times; once asking to go out, the second time to ask again if she can come to my dinner.

I take all my kids to school every morning, which means I spend almost an hour every morning with transportation (Jenna and Reese are in high school, Darrel is in middle school, and Jake in elementary). Jenna is a senior this year and she has no first period, meaning she could come to school late. Her school runs on a weird schedule so instead of 7 classes a day she has 3 one day and 3 the other day, with classes around 2 hours long each.

  
She asked me this year if she can stay home for a while longer since she doesn't have to be there for first period. I told her no because I don't want to take a second trip just for her. She protested and said she didn't want to wait at school for two hours before her first actual class. She offered to walk to school but I shut that down as well. I made her leave for school with the rest of her siblings and she was grumpy but I stood my ground.

Our landlord didn't have measurements of the bedrooms so we chose each room before knowing what the cost would be, but agreed before hand that we'd split it via square foot, and based off each rooms features.

Come move in day last month, I see that the room I chose had some issues that two of the roommates knew about and did not tell me (the room was not livable and they kept parts of that from me). We chose our rooms but We hadn't arranged rent before. I was the only one who had not seen any of the rooms. When we came to discuss this two weeks ago, the amount I came to via square footage ALONE was ~150 lower than each of their rooms. The quality of the three of their rooms is significantly better to mine. They became very dismissive and even more so when I said that I would need to lower it a bit more because of the features of the room. They told me they couldn't afford to do that, even though I negotiated up with them. I offered to switch rooms and pay the larger amount I had asked them to, so that we could live in a fairer space, and that upset them.

I'm frustrated because we agreed to how we'd split the rooms before hand, then when it came down to it, they tried to deny ever agreeing to that. Further, they held back parts about the bedroom. They'd like me to pay over the amount of the square footage of my room now. I'm looking for new places to live now, and hopefully someone that will take over my lease. But AlTA?

77,1f8ubzg,AITA for leaving my party for beating cancer?,"I (35M) am a very private person, I have no social media, don't want my wife (32F) posting photos of me, although I don't tell her not to, just don't ask her to post me. Celebrating Father's Day or my birthday, I don't like attention on me and prefer to keep things low key whenever I can.

So, keeping that in mind, I was diagnosed with an extremely curable type of skin cancer. It was caught very early on and I never felt scared for my life in any way, shape or form. I'm an engineer and I think analytically and wasn't scared with a diagnosis with a 0.03% fatality rate. Still, I told my wife of course, and she was terrified. We talked through it and told her my doctor was very optimistic and said we have caught it early on, etc. None of it seemed to help, but I tried. After a while, I told her that we shouldn't tell our kids, 5F and 7F. My wife wanted to tell them, but I was adamant about that, I'm not even sure they would understand what we're talking about. Reluctantly, she agreed not to.

About a week later, I get a call from my dad.....asking about my cancer. Turns out, my wife posted on FB about my cancer that morning. I called her and wasn't happy that she posted my business and his behind the ""You didn't say I couldn't post it, just not to tell the kids"" excuse. There is no way she would think I wanted that posted online, no matter what I said. So, she took it down and time went by.

Very quickly, I was in remission with my skin cancer and my doctor told me, word for word, ""We don't like to say you're 'cured', but, you're cured"". I told my wife and she was ecstatic. She told me she was worried all this time (I could tell) and glad we put this all behind us. I thought we could put this all behind us too....

This weekend, I'm coming home on Friday. I see a lot of cars parked on the street, some in my driveway. I couldn't think of any birthdays or anniversaries I missed, but went in anyway...... It was a party for my remission diagnosis. I was mortified at this, she's never done anything like this and we've talked about how I would hate a surprise party multiple times. I asked what this is for a said ""I'm sorry, but I didn't know you planned this, I'm just coming back for some files and heading back to work"". It was a lie, I gathered up some meaningless files in my office and said thanks to everyone for coming and left to go back to my office, messing around on my phone until everyone left.

My wife knew I was lying and we fought that night and I told her I don't know what's gotten into her, but she knows I would never want this and she doesn't get to make a big deal out of something personal I never wanted to be public in the first place.

However we both slept in a bit. She said it was fine, we'd make it back. I said let's not risk it and let's just go tomorrow instead.

So we are STILL GOING TO GO, just not today.

Her issue is that: (general her words)

I do this every time. Because we can push plans around (we live together), I'll cancel on her for other things. Her issue isn't necesaarily that we are going tomorrow instead, but that I'm pushing plans again for something else. Choosing something over her repeatedly.

But if we have the ability to push things, I don't see the big deal? We can go tomorrow and there would be absolutely no issues. I get to enjoy football, we both go out tomorrow. It works.

This is frequently a source for arguments between us. Beyond that we are super close.

Like... if I make plans with her for the weekend. But a friend randomly reaches out, I cancel our plans and go with the friends. Because we can rearrange easily. Whereas I can't with friends.

I get it's annoying sometimes. But it works out easier. But she says it's about constantly being left over others.

She has a very open schedule so it doesn't cause inconvenience. She said she doesn't care about that. It's about feeling hurt.",Asshole,2024-09-04,"AITA for cancelling plans because there's a football game on? Okay so...

I love him a lot, but he can occasionally be a bit of a stereotypical 'gym rat', he loves working out and showing off his abs and muscles, and often encourages me to go to the gym with him. I'm hardly unfit myself, but I'm not as interested in it as Mark is. One thing I did quite like the sound of was when he suggested I come with him for rock climbing. I thought it would be fun, and we could talk and it'd be a 'couple's thing', but it really wasn't.

I ended up going home early, and took Mark's bag by mistake. About an hour later, I got a call from Mark, who was pretty pissed asking where his shirt was. This is where I was probably the asshole, because I told him he should have no problem getting home without it, considering he'd just spent the last 3 hours without it. 

After getting home, Mark has no longer been speaking with me, and when I tried to apologise he snatched his shirt back and put it on as he left the apartment, saying he'd never been that embarrassed in his life.

83,1f8tp71,AITA for going off on my best friend of 11 years after he kicked me out of his house for making his boyfriend uncomfortable?,"I (22M) have been best friends with ""Mike"" (24M) since 8th grade. We're both gay, but we've never dated or had any romantic interest in each other. However, we have this dynamic where, while we don’t kiss or go on dates, we occasionally have sex when we feel like it. It’s purely casual and never happens if one of us is in a relationship—because that would be cheating. Our boundaries are firmly set, and it’s never been an issue between us.

Last month, Mike started talking to someone, and they made it official this month. This weekend, our friend group got together for a barbecue to catch up, and Mike brought his boyfriend, ""John"", to meet everyone. John seemed like a really nice guy, and we all got along well.

The problem started when one of our friends made a joke about Mike and I sleeping together. John’s face immediately changed, and it was clear he didn’t know about it. He stormed off, and Mike went after him. They were gone for about 30 minutes before they finally came back, looking tense.

I was supposed to sleep at Mike's house that night because we were both traveling the next day, different places, but my destination was on the way to his, so his family was going to drop me off. But after everyone else left, and it was just the three of us, John asked Mike to talk privately. When they returned, John said his goodbyes and went home and Mike told me I had to leave because John was feeling uncomfortable about me sleeping there.

Here’s where I think I might be the asshole. I lost it. I said that while I understood how John was feeling I couldn’t believe he was kicking me out over a guy he just started dating, I got really hurt and brought up his past relationships that he ended over minor issues, like one ex being slightly rude when woken up or another insisting on ordering Uber Black to control the car’s temperature, and said that he was kicking me out over a relationship that probably would end up the same way as the other ones and that he didn't needed a boyfriend, he needed therapy.

We both worked on the same team and for context she had the position above mine, but did not have a say in my hiring and did not have the power to promote or fire me. We worked together for about a year before she moved on to other opportunities and I remained at the company, got promoted and started building out my career. 

Emily and I remained friends and hung out frequently and even traveled together, but every now and then when she would introduce me to people she would mention how she used to be my boss. This used to bother me a little bit because she technically was never my boss because she never had the power to hire or fire me. However, I let this roll off my back because we no longer work together and overall this distinction is not a big deal to me. 

Anyway, fast forward to now I’ve since left the company where Emily and I met to start a company with my business partner, let’s call him “Rob”. Rob and I have been building our business for about 2 years now and it’s been full on and taking up a lot of my time, but it’s been a really fun process. When I mention how well my new business is doing to my friends they’re all really happy for me. However, when I mention my business in front of Emily she either brings up how she used to be my boss or she’ll say things about how Rob needs to fire me so that I can have more free time. I always say that Rob can’t fire me because we’re equals and we both own our business together.

But my bestie comes around and says she feels bad that I won’t invite one and bc she’s very nice to bestie.

This specific person, I’ll call Ana, is the biggest pick me alive. She’s constantly made fun of the way I dress and how I do my makeup (very clubby/rave/girly I guess?). And this entire year it’s been pissing me off. Any event that I’m at and Ana is there, she’ll make comments. She’s not one to dress up or do much if at all any makeup, which isn’t bad, it’s just like why make fun of other ppl?

Not only that, but Ana has been as ass to bestie before as well, such as making her come to this event, telling bestie she can drive her home and then suddenly changing her mind when they’re at the event. Then going on to ditch her at said event for boys. Stuff like that. Not to mention that Ana is besties with Bella. Bella is the main source of discourse between all our friends, spreading shit, shit talking and then specifically hating on bestie. That’s why I chose not to invite them.

89,1f8rw2q,AITA for telling my parents I can't wait to move out and get away from them?,"Sorry if I sound kinda whiney about this. I'm really tired of everything. So my parents have me (16m), my brother J (13), sister L (11), sister S (9) and brother T (6). My parents are expecting another kid in like a month. They treat me so differently. I had chores from a young age, was babysitting my siblings from a young age (7 technically when I started) and I was left ""in charge"" when we'd go shopping because I had to make sure my siblings didn't run off or anything or hold their hands. They never had any chores to do. My parents don't ask them to do anything. Just me. When I say no they'd get mad and make me. I'd ask why I had to do stuff and not my siblings and they'd say my siblings were younger so it made sense. This continued for years and as they had more, nothing changed regarding chores. My siblings won't even throw stuff in the trash. They throw it on the floor or leave it behind for others to pick up after them.

I resent having it on my shoulders when I was younger than all of them when I was first assigned chores. My parents and I have this tension between us since they announced mom's pregnancy. The closer mom gets to giving birth the worse it gets because I put my foot down more and they told me I didn't get to say no to them.

Then a few weeks ago I ended up in the hospital and diagnosed with a heart condition. It was scary af. And the house fell apart while I was in hospital. Literally it was disgusting by the time I came back and it wasn't because they were so focused on me. My parents only came in when a doctor was calling or when they were asked to. The rest of the time I was alone. A social worker was assigned to us after my hospital stuff and she heard all that was going on and said she'd help us. She said she would make sure we had enough so it wasn't on me as much. But they're not listening to her and I was expected to get back to normal. None of my siblings cared when I got out. They still tell me to do stuff for them. I told the social worker my parents were ignoring her and she told me to be prepared for nothing to change because they won't remove me for anything going on.

My first night back my parents went out and left me babysitting. The house was still filthy and I'm refusing to do it because it would take forever. My parents keep saying if I'm doing better I should be back to normal even though I was told to take it easy for a couple of months. Yesterday they were complaining that the baby could come at any time and the house is disgusting. I said it wasn't my fault. They told me it's my job to take care of this stuff. I told them they should have all of us doing some chores so it's not on a single person. Things continued and then I told them I can't wait to move out and get away from them when I'm 18 and that they're shitty parents who don't deserve to have kids. They were like wtf do you mean you're leaving when you turn 18 and then asked where I'd go and why am I being a brat.

They never had any chores to do. My parents don't ask them to do anything. Just me. When I say no they'd get mad and make me. I'd ask why I had to do stuff and not my siblings and they'd say my siblings were younger so it made sense. This continued for years and as they had more, nothing changed regarding chores. My siblings won't even throw stuff in the trash. They throw it on the floor or leave it behind for others to pick up after them.

I resent having it on my shoulders when I was younger than all of them when I was first assigned chores. My parents and I have this tension between us since they announced mom's pregnancy. The closer mom gets to giving birth the worse it gets because I put my foot down more and they told me I didn't get to say no to them.

Then a few weeks ago I ended up in the hospital and diagnosed with a heart condition. It was scary af. And the house fell apart while I was in hospital. Literally it was disgusting by the time I came back and it wasn't because they were so focused on me. My parents only came in when a doctor was calling or when they were asked to. The rest of the time I was alone. A social worker was assigned to us after my hospital stuff and she heard all that was going on and said she'd help us. She said she would make sure we had enough so it wasn't on me as much. But they're not listening to her and I was expected to get back to normal. None of my siblings cared when I got out. They still tell me to do stuff for them. I told the social worker my parents were ignoring her and she told me to be prepared for nothing to change because they won't remove me for anything going on.

My first night back my parents went out and left me babysitting. The house was still filthy and I'm refusing to do it because it would take forever. My parents keep saying if I'm doing better I should be back to normal even though I was told to take it easy for a couple of months. Yesterday they were complaining that the baby could come at any time and the house is disgusting. I said it wasn't my fault. They told me it's my job to take care of this stuff. I told them they should have all of us doing some chores so it's not on a single person. Things continued and then I told them I can't wait to move out and get away from them when I'm 18 and that they're shitty parents who don't deserve to have kids. They were like wtf do you mean you're leaving when you turn 18 and then asked where I'd go and why am I being a brat.

90,1f8riph,AITA for playing a simple prank at my job's lunch room?,"I'm really losing my mind here so help me out with this.

I'm one of the supervisors at a casino. I help supervise the poker room, and we have a ""bad bead jackpot"" which pays massively. Currently it is $400k. The bad bead jackpot hits when a player loses while holding a very high hand, so the probability of it is extremely low. (for example, you have four-of-a-kind and you lose to a straight flush)

As you know, employees of a casino are not allowed to gamble in their own casino. So I, with the permission of my higher ups, decided to play a very simple prank/joke. In our break room we have a ""news"" pinboard where we announce new regulations set by the gambling commission, congratulate workers on getting promoted, remind workers of important dates, etc.

So the joke I played was that I set up a congratulatory message where it's announced that I have won the bad-beat jackpot. I had the other managers take my photo at the poker room (after it closed) with me giving a thumbs up looking real happy. In the photo I have the poker hands set up to look like I was a player who had just  qualified to receive the bad beat jackpot. The poster basically said ""congratulations to (my name), one of our own, to win (our casino's name)'s $423,590 bad beat jackpot!""

It's a very obvious joke. We set it up a few days ago, and is due to stay there for a week. Many people found it hilarious. It was all fine and dandy until today one of our slot attendants came to the break room and saw the poster. He had a ""woah wtf"" reaction and then he spotted me sitting there and he asked if I'm serious that i really won it. Then I laughed and said yeah it's just a prank I'm playing, no I didn't actually win because that's not allowed. He was like ""dude that's a shitty thing to do to"" and said it's an inappropriate prank to play on other employees.

I was flabbergasted by his reaction. I asked what was so offensive about it and he just repeated that it's not cool to joke about breaking policies set by our commission. 

I told another supervisor who helped planned it and he was also confused. I've never really spoken to this kid, as we work in different departments  but even then all my interactions with him up until this point have been nothing short of normal. I really don't get it.

Like I said I'm still flabbergasted. I have zero idea what is so offensive about this. No one else other than that guy had a problem with it. Only my name was on the poster, only I was in the photo in the poster. The joke is very simple. As an employee I can't play at my own casino. So the joke is that I played at the casino. It's so, so innocent and I don't get how anyone could take offense to it.

94,1f8p1mt,AITA for correcting my half siblings when they say their dad is my dad too?,"My (16f) parents are divorced. I was 3 when their marriage ended. They share custody 50-50 of me still. For as long as I can remember mom has always blamed dad for it and said he cheated. My dad never said anything. He refuses to badmouth mom. But I know he really dislikes her. My grandma (dad's mom) told me mom was the one who cheated and she's the one who even got pregnant with someone else's child and had an abortion to try and conceal it, that dad had asked her directly and suddenly she was no longer pregnant (this was after me).

I can't know the truth obviously. But I lean more in favor of my dad.

The reason? My mom remarried when I was like 5 and she has tried so many times to push dad out and get her new husband in. She has lied to the kids she has with her husband and told them he's our dad and when I go for a week, it's to some ""uncle"" and I mistakenly think he's my dad. So I have half siblings who'll refer to my mom's husband as ""our dad"" and they'll step in to correct me when I call him by his first name. I usually end up correcting them and around and around we go.

I dislike my mom's husband. I think he really wants me to accept him and let him take over from dad but he never stops to listen when I say I love my dad and it upsets me when they talk shit about him. He always tells me I should have him instead of dad at Father's Day activities. This was worse when I was younger and that stuff was more there. He'd always try to get me to go to Father/Daughter dances with them (including purity ones which eww). And he'd get annoyed when I'd say no. He'd tell me he puts so much work into me and I should return the effort.

My dad tried to get custody from the judge at my request, we were in court literally weeks ago, but the judge said I need to continue 50/50 until I'm 18 and if either parent attempts to prevent that then the other will get full custody of me.

So I'm stuck here and my half siblings, the older they get, the more annoying they are about correcting me and then I correct them too. I told them the other day that their dad isn't my dad and I don't even like their dad or love their dad.

Two of the new starters were only focused on work and made it clear from the start they were not interested in small talk and just wanted to get on with their job. The other two however were a lot more talkative.

One of them, lets call him Matthew is involved in a martial arts club I was thinking of joining so we've been talking about that and have made plans for me to go to that soon.

The other trainee, lets call her Rebecca, is interested in similar movies and video games to me so we've been talking about that and made plans to play online together. I've got them both on social media along with a the current trainees who I have had on social media since we started together. 

This was a few weeks ago and since then I have started the martial arts club and have played games online with Rebecca a couple of times. I've told my girlfriend about this when I talk about my day at work and what my plans are. She said she finds it weird I'm gaming online with another woman. I aske what exactly was wrong with that but she just said she finds it a bit suspicious and disrespectful. 

I asked if it was also disrespectful for me to be friends with Matthew but she just said that was different. I just told her I'm not treating colleagues or friends different just because of their gender. She said she thinks I should stop gaming with Rebecca but I refused.

I've worked my current job for two years and this year we hired four new people to the same role. It's a trainee role and part of tht is that gthe trainees who have been there for longer carry out the inductions for then ew starters so me and the other two current trainees were tasked with this for the new starters. 

Two of the new starters were only focused on work and made it clear from the start they were not interested in small talk and just wanted to get on with their job. The other two however were a lot more talkative.

One of them, lets call him Matthew is involved in a martial arts club I was thinking of joining so we've been talking about that and have made plans for me to go to that soon.

The other trainee, lets call her Rebecca, is interested in similar movies and video games to me so we've been talking about that and made plans to play online together. I've got them both on social media along with a the current trainees who I have had on social media since we started together. 

This was a few weeks ago and since then I have started the martial arts club and have played games online with Rebecca a couple of times. I've told my girlfriend about this when I talk about my day at work and what my plans are. She said she finds it weird I'm gaming online with another woman. I aske what exactly was wrong with that but she just said she finds it a bit suspicious and disrespectful. 

I asked if it was also disrespectful for me to be friends with Matthew but she just said that was different. I just told her I'm not treating colleagues or friends different just because of their gender. She said she thinks I should stop gaming with Rebecca but I refused. She said I'm not listening to her and being disrespectful.

98,1f8o7i3,AITA for messaging my partner's friends?,"throwaway

I (F33) am with my gf, Leila (F28) of 5 years. After enduring a LDR for most of our relationship, I know that I want her by my side forever. I am wanting to propose, but am fine waiting so we are both prepared. We have discussed all the various topics before, so I know what she wants, and she knows what I want.

The problem is her friends. I don't try to get between my gf and them, and am happy to support Leila in her friendships despite what happened before. At the end of 2023, their attitude towards me completely changed. I don’t know why, other than it's involving how ""they cannot trust me and my feelings for Leila."" They have never given me a chance to talk to them, to understand their pov. I don't expect it in any way but I would at least like some form of closure if possible.

I know they frequently ask Leila ""are you \*still\* dating them?"" as if they are waiting for Leila to see whatever perceived deal-breaking flaw that they saw. Leila has expressed that yes, she is, and is very happy. I have left it at that, content that we were secure and that should be it. But the more I think about wanting to propose to her, the more I worry.

Leila is not good with conflict, and neither am I. She loves her friends and me, and I know it hurts her to have her friends so against me. I won’t give up our relationship for her friends' satisfaction, but her friends and I are the only support network she has, as neither of our families will want anything to do with us once this all comes out. And because of friends’ negative attitude, it is very likely that should we get married, they will not attend the wedding, and I know that will break her heart.

Where I might be the AH: She recently mentioned being stressed out about her friends bringing me up again, and so I sent them all a message. I tried to keep my tone as non-aggressive as possible, but I basically told them that they need to stop with this ""Highschool level petty BS"" and to just tell me what the hell I did wrong, and to stop pestering Leila. That I was planning on staying with her for as long as she wants me, and that they just need to accept that. They don't need to like me. They don't have to interact with me. But to leave Leila alone about it.

Needless to say, they only reiterated what they said before and that this message ""proves"" that I don't care about my gf, and then proceeded to block me. Leila is upset that I messaged them, even though she understands why I got frustrated. We aren't fighting over this, but this is the closest we've come to an argument in the years we've been together. And this is only causing more drama than either of us needs. I'm just tired of them acting so childishly, and for bringing it up so often. I know it's their problem, but I don't want Leila to lose her only other friends because of me.

So, AITA for wanting to date my GF, and for messaging them to tell them to stop their bs?

101,1f8nig2,AITA for not asking my GF if my sister can live with us.,"Hello!

Intro:

I Jeff (28m) have a younger sister Julia (27f), we are orphans and spent our lives in orphanages, and this might be the reason my sister clearly has some mental health problems. (Not diagnosed, she has never made the first step - admitting any problems)

At first, she seems like a normal person, but she can't keep anything or anyone in her life longer than a few months or sometimes a year, she changes jobs and friends more than some people change socks, and it is always someone else's fault when things don't work out.

All her coworkers and bosses are always assholes every time something goes south.

I am used to her nonsense and can keep our relationship working as I know her well and I have my own set of rules - for example, I never lend her money.

It might be narcissism (I am no psychologist though) and I am the ""flying monkey"", but a self-aware one giving her only things to keep her from ending up in the street.

Years ago I built a ""guesthouse"" on top of the garage which is a separate building in my yard, so I could offer her a place to stay every time she got kicked out because the landlord was bad or she just lost her job and can't afford it anymore - in short I provide her warm place to stay, bed to sleep in and keep food in the ""guesthouse"" fridge until she gets on her feet again. It is basically like a studio apartment.

I met my girlfriend Lenna (26f) a year ago and I told her about my relationship with my sister and she did not make much of it, it is like she did not really listen to what I told her or what she expected, that person who is over 25 must be grown up by now.

Moving on to the problem:

My sister made a record and worked in one place for more than a year straight! And of course, things went south this summer and she can't afford rent and she is back in my ""guesthouse"".

That pissed off my girlfriend, that I did not even ask her ""I thought this is our home!""  
And that she sets bad example to our kids (We both have a kid from previous marriage)

I tried to remind her, that I told her what relationship I have with my sister, she is the only living relative I have (besides my kid).

I pointed out, that it would be stupid to ask her opinion on something I told her before might happen anyway.

Now she calls me an asshole for acting like it is not her home, for not asking if she is okay with someone else staying in our home. (Technically on our land, separate building.)

Now, I know it sounds a little childish, but yeah, we did chat until 3. We laughed and had normal conversations about each other's taste in music, movies, and TV shows. And then, just like that, we kept chatting with each other for 4 months. We did the Spotify blend thing, shared the Playlist, and all. 

I can tell, looking back at my life, I can tell those were the best days of my life. I was happy to have her. But still, we were not able to confide in each other sometimes. Which is stupid, but still, we love to chat with each other.

One day, the fight broke out... we've got different opinions about the talk. But, for God's sake, I texted my friend to tell him the situation, and he said, ""Just say your opinions are neutral."" I did accordingly... and sorted out the situation. Still, we were cool about it. We continue to chat daily. It was all peaceful.

104,1f8nbu5,AITA for constantly turning off my roommate's TV so I can sleep?,"For context, I live in a house for mentally and physically disabled people, since I myself am mentally disabled. Currently, I have two roommates. One is super nice, and she respects me. She's the perfect roommate imo. The other one is the subject of this post.

She's mentally a toddler/6 year old, and for lack of a better term, she can be quite awful.

One thing I've started to notice recently is that she'll be awake at the wee hours of the night, watching TV and squeaking her bedframe. She goes to bed at 10 PM, but I don't think she sleeps. At all. It's currently 3:30 AM, and every time I try to close my eyes so I can sleep, all I hear is *squeak, squeak, squeak.* My hearing is VERY sensitive to sharp, shrill noises if I'm not expecting them, and after a while of the noise continuing, I get a headache.

I also noticed that her TV is always on at night. And I mean ALWAYS on. I think this is the source of her staying up all night. I only noticed this because whenever I get up to go to the bathroom, her room has that glow, indicating her TV is on.

Her door is open 24/7 aside from when she's changing. The reason this is, is because she's 24 hour care, so staff needs to check on her all hours of the night, make sure nothing bad happened. This causes the squeaking noises to be louder than if her door was closed. I keep my door closed, and yet it's still super loud.

I've taken to using my Roku app to shut her TV off, and it seems to help, but I think she's starting to turn it back on after I shut it off. So it usually takes 4, 5, sometimes 6 attempts before she finally quits.

Recently, I've been wondering if I'm TA for doing this, as I'm limiting the hours she can watch TV, but at the same time, I have appointments I need to keep, and most are before 10 AM.

I'm considering letting the house manager know, so that *maybe* staff will take away her remote at night.

I feel selfish, but I also think this is necessary so I can actually sleep.",Asshole,2024-09-04,"AITA for constantly turning off my roommate's TV so I can sleep? For context, I live in a house for mentally and physically disabled people, since I myself am mentally disabled. Currently, I have two roommates. One is super nice, and she respects me. She's the perfect roommate imo. The other one is the subject of this post.

She's mentally a toddler/6 year old, and for lack of a better term, she can be quite awful.

One thing I've started to notice recently is that she'll be awake at the wee hours of the night, watching TV and squeaking her bedframe. She goes to bed at 10 PM, but I don't think she sleeps. At all. It's currently 3:30 AM, and every time I try to close my eyes so I can sleep, all I hear is *squeak, squeak, squeak.* My hearing is VERY sensitive to sharp, shrill noises if I'm not expecting them, and after a while of the noise continuing, I get a headache.

I also noticed that her TV is always on at night. And I mean ALWAYS on. I think this is the source of her staying up all night. I only noticed this because whenever I get up to go to the bathroom, her room has that glow, indicating her TV is on.

Her door is open 24/7 aside from when she's changing. The reason this is, is because she's 24 hour care, so staff needs to check on her all hours of the night, make sure nothing bad happened. This causes the squeaking noises to be louder than if her door was closed. I keep my door closed, and yet it's still super loud.

I understand there are fixed utility rates like trash or wifi. Our landlord pays for trash and he covers the wifi (I honestly don't know why but he does). There are four of us total and the three have been in and out but have been consistently at the house, with the one saying I should pay living there full time.

111,1f8mefh,AITA Sister broke anime figure and I wish for her to fund replacement ,"I took a trip to Japan not to long ago and bought a few things to take back home. One of those things was an anime figure. Now me (19) and my sister (16) share a room together so I knew that finding a place to place my figure was going to be challenging. I eventually settle on this glass box on top my dresser. My sister doesn't like this but I tried to discuss other solutions only for them to lie on deaf ears. So I leave it there. Well arguments ensue with the only solution being to take it down. I didn't really listen to her because there was no flexibility or resultion or willingness to compromise.

 Well as always it becomes an argument again and she gets mad and throws the figure onto the bed. I noticed that the base broke off and I tried to put it back together unfortunately what I didn't realize was that the mounting peg of the base was broken I place the figure back only to wake up the next morning to see the figure broken. I was devastated as the figure that had meant so much to me would now never be the same. While it was able to be fixed its admittedly still doesn't feel right and I feel like something has been lost from me. 

So because of that I'm asking for the MSRP of the figure back so I can buy the same figure or another one. It won't be the same as having the original but it would be a meaning sorry to me. However my sister has this attitude that she doesn't have to pay for anything and that I had it coming by leaving it on display for so long. I feel that if she had hid the figure without damaging it that would have been more reasonable, but to break the figure and not wish to pay seems a little harsh

. I wasn't able to convince her as she thought that the damage was minimal and because it could be fixed there's no issue. Anyways Mom sides with the sister but is possibly going to cover the cost of a replacement. I just don't know what to think. I admit that I might often be eclectic about anime to my family's annoyance and that I didn't budge for 2 weeks on the figure's location but I can understand hiding it but not breaking it. Anyways that's why I turn to reddit for this judgment

114,1f8m3ma,AITA for not letting my niece visit my sister because she curses excessively,"I (28F) have a daughter ""Lily."" (8F) My sister ""Jenny"" (35F) adores Lily and often has her come visit at her house. Lily really looks up to Jenny and is always eager to visit her. The problem here is that Jenny has recently been cursing a lot. I have no idea when it started, but recently it's like she has no filter at all. She curses 24/7, whether it be around me and my friends or just when she's with Lily. Lily has been recently saying phrases and words that she's picked up from my sister. How would I know, you might ask?  Nobody else, (not me, not my husband, not her friends' parents,) ever curses around her, that's why I know that it can only be from my sister. Lily has started saying swear words in the house (she likes to copy what adults say) and I've had to explain to her that those are words she cannot use. She seems mostly receptive and has stopped saying them in the house, but I'm still worried because god forbid she starts saying these phrases behind my back and gets herself into trouble at school.

I've firmly told Jenny that I will no longer be taking Lily to visit her unless she promises to stop cursing, like at all, around her. Jenny thinks that I'm being ridiculous. She doesn't see the issue at all and says it doesn't matter, Lily doesn't even care. I explained to her that Lily is learning this language from her and one day she's going to get herself into trouble if she keeps talking like her. Also call me crazy, but I just don't want an 8 year old using that kind of language at all. Jenny was infuriated that I was making such a big deal out of this. She still thinks I'm being unreasonable. I haven't taken Lily to visit her for two weeks now and I can tell Lily is upset, she keeps asking when we're going to Aunt Jenny's house. I've just told her that we're working out some issues and she seems to accept that answer but she's still very much upset.

(8F) My sister ""Jenny"" (35F) adores Lily and often has her come visit at her house. Lily really looks up to Jenny and is always eager to visit her. The problem here is that Jenny has recently been cursing a lot. I have no idea when it started, but recently it's like she has no filter at all. She curses 24/7, whether it be around me and my friends or just when she's with Lily. Lily has been recently saying phrases and words that she's picked up from my sister. How would I know, you might ask?  Nobody else, (not me, not my husband, not her friends' parents,) ever curses around her, that's why I know that it can only be from my sister. Lily has started saying swear words in the house (she likes to copy what adults say) and I've had to explain to her that those are words she cannot use. She seems mostly receptive and has stopped saying them in the house, but I'm still worried because god forbid she starts saying these phrases behind my back and gets herself into trouble at school.

I've firmly told Jenny that I will no longer be taking Lily to visit her unless she promises to stop cursing, like at all, around her. Jenny thinks that I'm being ridiculous. She doesn't see the issue at all and says it doesn't matter, Lily doesn't even care. I explained to her that Lily is learning this language from her and one day she's going to get herself into trouble if she keeps talking like her. Also call me crazy, but I just don't want an 8 year old using that kind of language at all. Jenny was infuriated that I was making such a big deal out of this. She still thinks I'm being unreasonable. I haven't taken Lily to visit her for two weeks now and I can tell Lily is upset, she keeps asking when we're going to Aunt Jenny's house. I've just told her that we're working out some issues and she seems to accept that answer but she's still very much upset.

116,1f8lsjk,AITA For Prom Drama?,"Prom was coming, and there was some drama about the dinner and photos. Here’s the breakdown:

# Key People:

* **Me**
* **Jordan**: My ex (we dated for 2 years)
* **Taylor**: Jordan’s twin sister, who has always “hated” me
* **Ella**: Best friend of the twins, a grade below us
* **Mason**: Jordan’s current date (making him the 3rd guy from our group Jordan has slept with)

**The Situation:** Ella invited herself to our prom dinner and photos, but the core group really doesn’t like her. Later, I asked Jordan and Taylor if they were okay with not inviting Ella, because they hadn’t said anything when she invited herself. They both erupted at me in front of our class and scolded me heavily. Later, Jordan texted:

* ""Okay, Ella is going to go and that's final. I can tell her not to interact with you if you would like. But it's literally 15 people.""
* ""And she is not just friends with me and my sister. She is also friends with Mason and Jamie.""
* ""So that's 4 people. And some of the other people coming are friends with less.""
* ""Just because you don't want to hang out with her isn't enough reason for her not to go. She is an amazing friend to me and I love her.""
* ""Asking me to say she can't go isn't something I will respond kindly to.""
* ""Let's all be inclusive and not try on our mean girl shoes here. Because it's not really going to affect anyone if she comes or not.""

# I replied:

* ""Jordan, if it’s really important to you that Ella comes, then absolutely, let's have her there. This is your prom dinner night, and I want you to have the best time possible.""
* ""Although this is nowhere near the same as Connor and I bringing our dates.""
* ""Ella isn't a part of our group. The original prom dinner idea was for the core group to bring their dates and all of us hang out. Ella isn’t your date, especially not if she’s bringing her boyfriend.""
* ""I don’t appreciate the way you snapped back and told me to stop explaining myself. If that wasn't a moment you wanted to talk about it, I'd rather you ask to talk later instead of shutting me down. Thank you for taking the time to text me.""
* ""I’m not trying to exclude Ella because I don’t like her. When she sits with us at lunch, people complain. I’m not trying to kick her out or force you to uninvite her. But the common feedback is 'Why is she sitting with us again?'""
* ""Ella can be fun, but she’s not part of the friend group. She’s a plus one from you, which feels awkward, especially with limited seating.""
* ""I've talked with Jamie. She likes Ella but agreed with Jasper and me that inviting her might be too much.""

117,1f8lqjj,AITA for refusing to relocate my pets for my housemate when I’m away?,"Hi all, apologies for the formatting as it’s on phone

I (F28) had my housemate (M30) move in with me approximately 2 years ago. I was in the rental for over a year before he moved in, and I had a cat and a puppy (now grown, approx 2 years old). They were here before him.

Initially, I didn’t expect any help with my animals as they’re my choice. He was very happy to help and wanted to look after them, despite me offering options - such as having a friend come around and check in.

After sometime, I started dating an ex and my roommate’s attitude seemed to have changed with me. I had some discussions with him as to why his attitude changed to me in general, which I didn’t get a clear response. Sometimes it was to do with me being a bad pet owner, then cancelling plans on him, or not inviting him somewhere etc. Also mentioned about my ex and I getting back together. 

Ever since, he doesn’t want my dog around if I go away for work (generally a week) and I have to place her into a kennel or someone’s home. I can’t have my dog checked in on by a friend, my housemate wants the dog completely out the house. I felt this was unfair as my dog was there beforehand, and I could get her fed and walked by a visitor. I accommodated to my housemate’s needs anyways.

Recently he said he doesn’t want my cat in the home either. I have a work trip coming up for a week, and he doesn’t want either animal to be present when I’m not there. For the cat, I know he gets sick of her meowing for attention. Again, I can have someone come by and look after them. 

AITA if I told him to deal with the animals being at the home as they were there first? And he can deal with a pet sitter checking in on them? I feel nervous saying anything like this. I don’t know if anyone who kicks their animals out while they are away? What should I say or do?

118,1f8lq67,AITA for adding a safety script to a freelance project that reversed my work when the client didn’t pay as agreed?,"I’m a DevOps Engineer with a steady job, but I also do some freelance work on the side. Around the end of July this year, I took on a project for a client in the UK. The job was to optimize around 150 Jenkins automation jobs that were, honestly, a bit of a mess.

We agreed it would take about 20 hours over a week, and I’d charge £100 per hour. But then the client asked if I could get it done in just 3 days. I said sure, but for that kind of rush, it would be double the rate — £200 per hour. They agreed.

To get this done quickly, I set up a Jenkins instance on my end and linked it to their server, which they were fine with. I made all the changes on my side, then copied the updated config files over to their machine. It was faster this way, but it also meant that how the changes were made wouldn’t show up in their Jenkins job configuration history.

Now, because I’ve had issues with payments before (and reading too many Reddit posts about unruly clients), I included a script in their server that would reverse all my work if things went south. The script would only run if my user ID wasn’t found on their system, which would only happen if they removed my access. I figured if they kicked me out silently without paying, they were probably planning to keep all my work for free. So, this script was my way of protecting myself. It was supposed to run on the Summer Bank Holiday (August 26). If I had access, I would just modify it to go off on a later date, or remove the script altogether if payment was completed without a hitch.

I finished the job by August 2nd, and the project was set to start from September. The client asked me to train their team, but I’m in India, and with the time difference and my full-time job, it just wasn’t feasible. Instead, I offered to make a training video, charged at my original rate of £100 per hour. It took about 2 weeks to make an 8 hours long video, and I sent it to them on August 17th. So far, they had only paid an initial booking fee of £800.

Then things got weird. The client, who had agreed to pay double for the rush job, suddenly decided they only wanted to pay the original £100 per hour for the whole thing. Their reasoning? They said they just mentioned the higher rate to “motivate” me to finish faster, and since I didn’t actually do twice the work, they felt I didn’t deserve twice the money. We went back and forth on this until the end of August, but neither of us budged.

August 26th rolled around, and that’s when the script kicked in. Turns out, they had removed my access, which triggered the script to reverse everything I’d done. After that, I sent them an email saying I was done with the project. I told them they could keep the training video and that I’d keep the £800 booking fee as payment for the video.

To say the client is pissed is an understatement, but I feel like I’ve been clear about my terms. But now I’m starting to wonder — did I go too far?

122,1f8l8n6,WIBTA for expecting my daughter to help out more or start paying rent,"I have 3 children (32M, 28M, 27F) 
32M is living abroad while his girlfriend finishes school. 

28M is disabled and lives with me and my wife. 

27F lives with me and my wife as well. 

The past 15 years or so my wife has developed a chronic health condition and it has been hard for her, but she has pushed through (even passed her limits), the past few years she has taken a turn for the worse and is really struggling now. (She would refuse to ask for help and would be stubborn, but now is asking for help)

I work long hours and help out as much as I can when I’m home. I usually take care of the lawn, and do the toilets and shower cleaning, take the trash to the curb, repairs, bathe the dogs, “bigger things” like that that don’t need to be done daily. 

My wife has asked our daughter to help her more, to unload and fill the dishwasher, take the garbage to the trash bins outside, and do laundry, and help sweep. My wife is doing this stuff as well but she is struggling and falling behind. What takes her 30min would take my daughter 5minutes. 

Our son gets the trash ready in the basement, helps fold laundry, tries to sweep and dust, and will do anything we ask to help to his ability. (He has said he knows his mother is struggling more and he wishes he could help more) 

I don’t know why (as we raised the kids all the same) but my daughter acts like it’s the end of the world to do something for us or to help around the house. She lives here too, it’s not like we’re asking her to clean our bedroom or her brothers. 

Or she will half ass it and wash the laundry but leave it in the washing machine and not hang it up to dry so the next day my wife has to re-wash it and then hang it up. 

The only time she really helps is when my wife has a meltdown and is upset about the state of the house. 

She works 30 hours a week at a higher than minimum wage job and does not pay rent because she is saving up to move out. 

Son 28 pays rent because he wants to, and will be living with us forever. 

Would I be the asshole if I tell my daughter she needs to start paying rent (we would use the money to hire a cleaner to come every 2 weeks to dust and wash floors and stuff) because she isn’t helping around the house. 

Also wouldn’t charge her market value in rent, I think last time we priced it out it would cost around $400 for a cleaner, so we would charge her that. 

EDIT TO ADD:
I’ve enjoyed reading the comments and will be reading them with my wife tomorrow. 

I wanted to add (in no way excusing her behaviour) that rent is literally unaffordable and houses are unattainable for Canadians right now.

As I've grown up I've come to realize how much of an  abusive and narcissistic person my father really is. I've always seen him with rose colored glasses, but he's been getting on my nerves. 
Half a year ago he took me on a walk around the nearby lake. During that walk he explained to me - when women get to a certain weight, they're no longer attractive. Referring to my mother, he continued to explain how he gave her a set boundary of how much she could eat in a day - how much weight she had to lose in a set amount of time or there would be a punishment. 
As time goes on, he would constantly shame myself and my younger sister for our eating habits and our bodies, to the point where we felt insecure  that further lead to an eating disorder we still struggle with to this day. Constantly he will always comment on our outfits. If we were showing a little bit of stomach or our shorts were shorter, he would say the classic ""you're asking for it"" or ""that outfit makes me feel uncomfortable."" Always saying that we needed to improve one thing or another to his standard. This has gone on for years.
And sadly we are unable to move out and leave him. He is financially abusive. Not letting my mother have any money to pay for things my siblings need. He has taken 200$ off our grocery budget, yet comes home with a new motor bike. I am working my ass off to get enough money to move us away from him.

124,1f8l7m2,AITA FOR WANTING MY UNCLE TO MOVE OUT?,"I (16F) want to tell my parents (40M, 36F) that they need to tell my maternal uncle (32M) he needs to move out. I know my parents would understand if I told them and would tell him to find another place but I still feel like I’d be the asshole.

Backstory: My mom is currently in another country along with my 2 sisters visiting family so it’s only my brother my dad and I living in our house. My uncle recently moved to where we live from another country. When he first came, he started living in an apartment with other guys. He works with my dad at our family business currently.

He got into an argument or honestly, I’m not sure what happened that made him move out from his apartment and into our house where he’s staying in one of the empty rooms. When I first heard about it I didn’t mind since I assumed he was waiting for maybe 1-3 days only but it’s been 3 weeks and he’s still here. He isn’t a creep or anything like that by any means but he and I aren’t close at all and I just don’t feel comfortable.

My brother stays in the room on the first floor while I’m on the second floor where my room is next to where my uncle is staying. I’m a private person so home is where I find the most peace but that’s kind of disappeared ever since he moved in. I can’t do things I’d normally do. I feel uncomfortable wearing things I used to wear (tank tops, etc). I know he’s never given me a reason for me to feel that way but I just can't stop feeling that way. 

This might sound kind of stupid but I like to play music and sing all the time. My uncle being here made me feel uncomfortable doing that. He and I just aren’t close and I’m an introverted person so singing and blasting music while he is in the room next to mine just feels weird.

He also smokes hookah and I’m extremely tired of the smell. As you know for hookah, you need small pieces of charcoal that you kind of need to heat up which he does on the kitchen stove. When he does that, the house starts smelling like charcoal and it’s just not a good smell at all and it annoys me so much that I have to open up every window to let the smell out. Not to mention, when he does that, ashes get all over the stove which I have to clean up. 

I’ve been avoiding coming out of my room into areas he’s at. For example, if he’s in the kitchen I avoid going there. 

He’s kind of into traditional cultural stuff that I don’t agree with or care for. So, I’m always feeling judged by him. Every time I go out and come home, I find him giving me a weird or judgemental look. I just hate that because I just wanna start yelling at him that it’s none of his business. 

My brother and dad aren’t that affected since my dad is mostly at work and my brother is mostly at school or in his room. 

I don’t know when he’s gonna move out honestly. He’s been using my mom’s car since she wasn’t here and has made himself comfortable. I feel like telling my parents I don’t want him here just makes me an asshole since he just moved to this country.

As part of starting this business, & because I know you aren't supposed to commingle personal & business finances, I opened a business bank account a couple months ago. It did not occur to me to talk to him specifically about starting this account--he knew I was starting a business & this is just part of it. We never spoke about any other details, like how I'm marketing or what apps I'm using for scheduling. He has a busy, stressful business of his own to run, so that's what we mostly talk about, not my little gig that I'm trying to get off the ground.  

Since opening it, I've transferred money from the business account into our personal joint checking several times over the last 4 months. And yet, just 2 days ago he asked me about why my freelance $ isn't coming into the personal account anymore & I told him it's going to my business bank. His reaction was ""Oh, so you have a SECRET bank?!""

It did not occur to me to talk to him specifically about starting this account--he knew I was starting a business & this is just part of it. We never spoke about any other details, like how I'm marketing or what apps I'm using for scheduling.

131,1f8k7ik,AITA for not being upset my young daughter cussed in class?,"My youngest daughter, fake name Tali, 13, has gorgeous red wavy hair. Think Merida from Brave, bright copper and mid back length. 

This is her first year in middle school, which started two weeks ago. Tali told me over this weekend that she's having troubles in one of her classes. There's a girl that sits next to her that for whatever reason has been pulling my daughter's hair multiple times in class every day. This class doesn't have assigned seating and no matter where Tali sits, this girl purposely sits next to her. Tali has told this student to stop touching her every time, which was ignored. After enduring this torment a few days, Tali told her teacher who scolded the student. The girl stopped for a day, but did it again the following day while threatening Tali with, ""You better not tell the teacher or else."" This scared Tali that the girl may try to do something to her hair which prompted her to talk to me.

Tali is proud of the unique shade of her hair as majority of other red heads she's met are strawberry blonde or deep auburn. For years, she's been taking extra care of it, hoping to grow past her waist so she is able to donate her hair to an organization that provides wigs for children fighting cancer. Tali has told me she would be devastated if something happened that prevented her of achieving her goal. 

When Tali told me what's been going on, I told her that next time this girl does it she's to tell her teacher again and if the teacher doesn't get this handled then we will both go to the principal and have the harassment documented and request an immediate resolution.

Well, today, I asked her if anything happened. She said yes it happened again. Then Tali tells me that this time the girl yanked her hair even harder than before, which caused ever more pain. That pissed Tali off bad, she immediately stood up in the middle of class, walked straight up to her teacher and said, ""That bitch is yanking my hair again!"" The teacher immediately moved the girl and is now enforcing an assigned seat for the girl. Tali is happy of the arrangement. The teacher didnt scold Tali for her language. 

Tali asked me if she's in trouble with me for saying what she said. I told her no, that the girl's continued harassment and by addressing her anger as such to the teacher was warranted to let it be known she was DONE with this bullshit. 

I'm actually proud Tali defended herself and spoke up against someone touching her body without her consent. When I told a friend of the situation, they were appalled I let my daughter cuss and how I should discipline her for her outburst. I disagree.

So am I the asshole for thinking my daughter was in the right of speaking how she felt in that moment? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-04,"AITA for not being upset my young daughter cussed in class?

134,1f8k1du,"AITA for being frustrated with my boyfriend who works constantly and has to leave at night for emergencies, even though he’s hired someone to handle it?","I (29F) have been with my boyfriend (32M) for three years. He owns two businesses, and while I’m incredibly proud of him, his work has started to take over our lives. His days are filled with meetings, managing staff, and handling the overall operations of both businesses, which is stressful enough. But the real issue is how much his work spills over into our nights and weekends, making it feel like we never have any real time together.

One of his businesses operates at night, so even though he’s hired a night manager, he still ends up dealing with problems almost every evening. It’s not just answering texts and emails — he often has to leave the house to handle emergencies in person, sometimes at 10 PM or even 2 AM. This happens 2-3 times a week. We could be in the middle of dinner, or finally settling in for a relaxing evening, and suddenly his phone rings, and off he goes.

For example, last week, we had made plans for a quiet evening together after a really busy month for both of us. We were watching a movie when he got a call about an issue with one of his crews. Without hesitation, he apologized, got dressed, and left. I didn’t see him again until after 3 AM. It was a repeat of something that happens all too often: plans getting interrupted or canceled because work always takes priority.

I’ve tried talking to him about setting better boundaries with work, especially since he has a manager who is supposed to handle these kinds of things, but he insists that it’s part of running a business and that I just don't understand what it's like. He always says that things will calm down eventually, but it’s been like this for three years, and I haven’t seen any real improvement.

What’s really worrying me is our future. We’ve talked about getting married and having kids, and while I want those things too, I’m genuinely concerned about what that would look like. If he can’t find a way to step back now, how will he be able to balance work with being a present father and husband? I don’t want to end up raising kids on my own while he’s constantly dealing with work issues at all hours of the day and night. 

I love him, and I know he’s working hard for our future, but I feel like I’m always playing second fiddle to his businesses. I’m starting to feel neglected and like we never get quality time without interruptions.

Sean basically said they didn't want to be friends anymore, didn't provide a reason, and that was that. I was pretty hurt and confused, and needed to process a lot of emotions. To make matters more complicated, Sean and I share many friends. In particular, we are both quote close with Stephanie (27f). This is the kind of stuff I would usually share with Stephanie, but since her and Sean are also close, I figured it was best to leave her out of it. Instead, I mostly handled it by myself, occasionally venting to friends who don't know Sean.

141,1f8it90,AITA for Chastising my Friend?,"Hello I’m on mobile. 

So I (24) have a friend named Amanda (26F). We’ve known each other for two years and frequently hang out. She had a couple kids, so we usually hang out at her house. I often watch her kids when I go over to help her focus on cleaning or will feed her animals when she goes out of town. She has also fed my cat for me when I was in the hospital. 

I had to go out of town for college (I attend virtually from three hours away). I asked her a week in advance to feed my cat while I was out of town because car rides stress him out. She immediately agreed. I clarified that she just has to refill his big bowl twice over the weekend because he paces himself eating. 

Friday, on my way to the college, she calls me and asks to hang out. I remind her I am travelling this weekend and gently remind her about my cat, and she says she will still be able to feed him. I then check in on Monday, the day I am coming home, and she confirms she checked his bowl. 

Long story short, I came home Monday and she didn’t actually feed him. I know this because I bought a brand new bag for her to use, and it was still unopened when I came home. Also his bowl was empty, and he was out of water. 

I texted her to ask for certain if she fed him. She confessed she didn’t because her weekend was too busy. I told her that should have let me know so I could make other arrangements. She then said “I apologised. I don’t appreciate you chastising me.”  I clarified that I was just telling her that I was upset she didn’t trust me enough to be honest. However, she still hasn’t replied to that message. It’s been a week since I sent the last message, and she’s ignoring me.

142,1f8ic5c,AITA for turning down a job after my friend got me an interview?,"A close friend who works in the same field as I do (we're both 31 and female) called me and told me that her company was hiring. The position is in an area I prefer more than my current one, the salary is better, and it offers two days off per week, whereas I currently have 1.5 days off. However, this doesn't mean my current job, schedule, or salary is bad; it's just that the one she recommended is better.

She mentioned that she talked to HR about me, and they were willing to interview me before they officially posted the job opening. I was, of course, really thankful, and I expressed my gratitude to her profusely.

However, when they called me and we discussed the position, it turned out to be in another branch, not the one where my friend works, but one that's two hours away. This would mean a total of four hours of commuting every day, while my current commute is only one hour round trip. As a single mom of a 6-year-old, I already feel like I'm missing out on watching my daughter grow up, as I only see her for a few hours each day during the workweek. I don't want to add an additional three hours to my commute, which would be three hours less with my daughter every day.

Furthermore, my current schedule is 9-5 Monday to Friday and 9-1 pm on Saturday, with Sunday off. My daughter goes to school Monday to Friday and has karate on Saturday mornings, so this schedule works well for us because Saturday afternoon and all day Sunday are mom-daughter time. While the other job offers two days off per week, those days wouldn't be Saturday or Sunday, and I don't want to miss that time with my daughter.

Additionally, while the salary is better, I'd end up spending more on babysitters (because I’d need someone to watch my daughter during the extra commute and weekends) and gas, so I'm not sure I'd end up making more money overall. I politely declined the offer, and they seemed understanding. I told my friend I was grateful, and I genuinely was, but I had to turn down the job for the reasons mentioned above.

Unfortunately, she got upset and said she went to great lengths to talk to HR about me because she knew I preferred that area and wanted me to make more money. She accused me of being ungrateful and not thinking about my daughter and how much more comfortable her life could be with a larger salary. I explained again that I was thankful, but as a mom, there are many factors to consider before making decisions. She called me ungrateful again and is now not replying to my messages.

We recently found out she was still vaping, found w33d and n1cotine products in her room she’d stolen from my husband and I, found my tattoo equipment used and damaged, found inappropriate things on my cellphone I’d been letting her use (which I did say she could only have from 9:30am to 8pm and I was lightly monitoring photos and messages.) She also searched on her period tracker how to make s3x and mas7er7ion more enjoyable. 

She’s 11. 

When asked how she could do that to me as I thought we were close she responded with “I made this whole personality just so I could manipulate you, I’m not a good person.” We had a discussion on if she wanted to be a good person or a shitty one and she kept saying she didn’t know which set off worried alarm bells that she was behaving like a sociopath. (She even went as far as lying to her counsellor) Then I found out she’d made a comment about setting the house on fire which was the last straw for me as everyone in my family knows that a house fire is my biggest fear. 

I had my sister pick her up as I did not feel safe in my home with her in it. I did tell her she wasn’t welcome in my home right now which made her very upset and was the only thing she took from our conversations. 

My housewarming bbq is coming up soon and my sister and niece are invited, but I feel like I have to make the rule that my niece is not allowed in my house without adult supervision and she can use the bathroom and only the bathroom, not go into other rooms of the house.

I’m afraid to tell my sister right now that my niece needs to be supervised as we just had a big conversation about a camera that’s missing that needs to be replaced, but I don’t want to tell them this rule of being supervised when they arrive cause I fear my sister will be upset and just leave which would put a damper on the party. 

WIBTA if I expressed this rule that my niece can use the bathroom but needs parental supervision when inside the house, to my sister?

The short answer is that no one was hungry and we didn't want to eat.

I don't have kids so I'm hoping someone with kids will chime in on this. I think I'm just kinda irritated that she expects me to force feed her and possibly waste food for no reason.

So fast forward, my MIL calls to check in and demands to know why I (the woman is always supposed to cook in her eyes) didn't cook. The short answer is that no one was hungry and we didn't want to eat. I made sure to verify that she wasn't hungry and I'd be more than happy to make something if she is and she said she wasn't so I didn't see the problem with not eating. I don't have kids so I'm hoping someone with kids will chime in on this. I think I'm just kinda irritated that she expects me to force feed her and possibly waste food for no reason. 

*SIL doesn't have any medical conditions that requires she eats at certain times btw. ",0.0,0.1213752627372741,0,1

He called me (nb22) yesterday while I assumed he was at the tattoo shop and said he was at his coworker’s house for her birthday with everyone else from the shop. I asked him why he didn’t mention it while he was on his way there and not as he’s at her house already and he just apologized and said it was last minute and he forgot. He asked me if I wanted to come and I said sure but then he called me back shortly after and said that they said I couldn’t come. Apparently it wasn’t her house but someone else’s which is why they said no.

I’m dressed at this point but it is what it is. I was checking on my friend who didn’t feel well (not sick, just migraines and cramps) and she asked me to come over for a house party. I said yes and texted my bf. He responded with, “Oh ight den,” which to me came off as him feeling some typa way but I ignored it to avoid starting anything. I get to the party round 8pm. While I’m at the party around 10pm he ends up calling me asking for a ride (I have a car and he doesn’t) and he asks if I can drop his coworker (not the bday girl but someone else) off too. I’m out so I tell him no. I tell him he can meet me where I’m at and we can drive home together but he declines. 

He ends up getting home around 11 and blows my phone up for an hour asking how long I plan on being out to the point it’s not even him being concerned, it's him being annoying.

That’s not fair. Don’t hang out with ppl who leave you stranded to begin wit. If they found a way to get u there they should be able to get u home or u find ur way home.

149,1f8gdnz,AITA for not letting my brother hold my newborn?,"For some context my husband Peter (33 m) and I (31 f) have been married for five years. He is from Ukraine while I am Canadian, but we both currently live in Latvia. We have two kids together, Buck (4 m) and our newborn daughter Lina (3 weeks f). Since I have given birth to Lina I have had severe postpartum depression. When I had Buck it was the same, but I thought it would get easier since this is my second birth.

A few days ago my family showed up on my doorstep. There were my three brothers, my mom, my dad, and my auntie. I was very surprised since I live in Latvia and they live all the way in Canada. I invited them in and asked why they were here. They told me that they planned this trip as soon as they found out what day my due date was. They said that they knew how bad the last pregnancy was (it was a high risk c-section) so they wanted to visit and help me to settle in with my new baby. I asked to talk to my mother in another room. I told her how I was going through some pretty bad postpartum and I didn’t know if I was ready for people over. She apologized for just showing up, and told me that she also thought that my postpartum wouldn’t be as bad this time. I found out that their trip was only two nights long. I thought that I could do it, so I told her that everything was fine. We went back into the room with the rest of my family. I explained that I was having very bad postpartum. I said how I would try my best to let them be with the baby but I couldn’t make any promises.

Soon Peter got home from work with Buck. Lina started crying so I went to the nursery to bring her downstairs with me. People instantly were all over me and Lina, trying to get a look at her. I was very overwhelmed but Peter helped keep everyone a few feet away from me. Everyone wanted to hold her, but I told them that after dinner I might let them. I made up a lie saying that Lina doesn’t really like new people. We ate take out for dinner and I found out that my family were going to a hotel to sleep. The rest of the night went smoothly along with most of the next day. I even let my mom and auntie hold Lina.

Things started to get bad when my youngest brother asked to hold her but I told him that I didn’t feel comfortable with that. He then started to get angry, calling me over protective and rude. He said how he just wanted to hold his first niece. My two other brothers have kids too, but they only have boys. I told him that saying that wouldn’t make me any more comfortable, and if he wanted to hold her then he would either have to wait until I was ready or until the next time that they visited. The room got tense as my brother and I stared at each other. He ended up leaving with most of my family. Only my mom and auntie stayed behind. This all happened two days ago. Everybody left my house yesterday. Now my family is split. One side says that I shouldn’t have been so harsh while the other agrees with me. So AITA?

150,1f8g54d,AITA For Explaining my Stressed State of Mind to my Wife?,"**--optional backstory--**

I (30m) have been married (33f) for almost a decade, and have one 2yr toddler at home. I just make enough money at a corporate job for her to be a stay-at-home mom, so that we don't need to pay for childcare. They're both wonderful and I don't deserve them. I, however, spent the last 10 years wasting my life to alcoholism and wasn't very available to her, and later, them, during that time.

It wasn't uncommon for her to be watching our son 75% of the time while we were both home, because I was playing video games and drinking 10-12 beers. ITA for sure, no question.

My last drink was Dec '23, and quitting was the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, and I struggle with it every single day 9 months later. Since then, I lost 34kg (75 lbs), I've been running (ran three 5ks last week!), and have been learning how to express my thoughts and feelings with words, instead of coping with a substance (I am working on kicking my THC vape habit too, but its slower progress). 

My point is only that I'm actively working toward improving the 'fairness' of our family dynamic, but I'm not there yet.

**--required backstory--**

Our normal work routine:

* I work 8-5
* 1-2 hours family time after work (dinner, play, talk)
* 2-3 hours personal time (vaping, gaming) from 7-10pm
* We all sleep around 9-10pm

It was always our plan for me to be the breadwinner while she stays home to raise our kids, but with the way prices are going, we've been looking into ways to earn more or spend less, etc. Well last week her old boss calls with a surprise saying that they had an un-expected call-off, and wanted her to cover the shift at double her previous rate! We discussed, and we both agreed this sounded like exactly what we were asking for, and she accepted.

This meant that I work 8-5, then come home and watch our son for another 4-5 hours until bedtime. No biggie, just a long Thurs\\Fri right?

**--aita--**

This week, she got another call for another 3 shifts, and accepted them right away. When I got home I told her that decision was really stressing me out because it meant another long(er) week where all of my normal coping mechanisms(running, gaming, smoking) are all put on hold until the weekend again for a 2nd week in a row.

So, she called her boss and cancelled all of the shifts, lying saying I had to be out of town, to reduce the stress for the week. I specifically asked her not to cancel them because of me, I wasn't asking her to change anything, I was just trying to be more open an honest about how I was feeling with her..

I can't help but feel like a complete failure of a parent\\spouse now.. I can't even handling extra after-work childcare? what a joke. She's stressed, we're not getting extra money, and I 'got my way', when all I was trying to do was open up about how I was feeling..

151,1f8fzg2,AITA for telling my mother I’ll never like my stepfather?,"

I (24M) recently had a conversation with my mother (49F) that’s been a long time coming. A little background: my mom got together with my stepfather (56M) when I was 4 years old. Since then, my relationship with him has been complicated, to say the least. 

Growing up, he was emotionally abusive. He would belittle me, make cruel jokes at my expense, and criticize me constantly. These weren’t the kind of things a kid forgets easily. His behavior planted the seeds of some of my deepest insecurities and traumas. Even though we’ve had periods where we’d get along—because I felt like I had no choice—I’ve always dreaded being around him. The emotional abuse was never far from the surface, and it has left a lasting impact on me.

A few weeks ago, my mom asked me why I’ve been distant lately, and I finally told her the truth: I’ll never like my stepfather. I explained how his mistreatment has affected me and that, while I’ve tried to make peace with it for her sake, I just can’t pretend anymore. I told her I don’t want to spend time with him, and I can’t force myself to have a relationship with someone who’s caused me so much pain.

Now I’m wondering if I should have just kept my mouth shut and continued to fake it for her sake. Maybe it would’ve been better to just keep the peace, but at the same time, I couldn’t keep lying to her.

I’m on vacation with my family and have been sick since two days before we got here. When we left for the airport it was 5AM, my oldest sister was coming along to drive the car back home from the airport as she’d only join us a week later and thus wanted a seat on the side to sleep. I didn’t wanna be in the middle seat because I can’t handle certain smells (including the one of that car) well so I knew I’d be carsick. I already wasn’t feeling well so I wanted to be near a window for fresh air to help me handle the car smell and also be able to throw up outside if it came to that. My sisters both refused to give up their seats for me and my whole family was annoyed I was making this such a problem. Okay, fine. Whatever. Fair, I probably should’ve just sucked it up from the beginning anyway. 

Well, as I predicted I started feeling my stomach burn as the scent made me painfully dizzy about five minutes in and I asked for the windows to be opened so I could get fresh air. However, we were on the highway so my family refused. I reminded them that they always tell me it’s a house of five and we gotta accommodate but they told me it’s four people who don’t wanna “go deaf” and one person who wants the windows open. I personally think that they should be able to deal with roaring wind for five minutes but I knew I wasn’t gonna gain anything and sucked it up. I spend 20 minutes of a 30 minute drive sobbing from the pain until eventually my middle sister opened her window when we were almost there anyway and it made no difference. I don’t even know if she did it for me or not but I’ll me generous and assume it was pity. 

Several other instances of this happened, and only twice did I get anything close to resembling sympathy. Even when I nearly threw up on the sideway after a day in the sun, the only reaction I got was yelling about “what do you want us to do?!” And to stop being dramatic even though I hadn’t asked for anything but a moment to gather my bearings. 

Flash forward to today, I was coughing up a lung in bed trying to get my breathing under control and my sister messaged me to tell me to be quiet. I guess she thought I was dancing in my room or something? I ended up taking my frustrations out on her by snapping that I’m trying not to suffocate but sure I’ll try to be quiet for them. She got defensive and we argued until I unloaded my frustrations on her, bringing up the situation with the car windows specifically. My sister is adamant that I was being unreasonable, and that since I wasn’t being clear enough about what was wrong it’s shitty of me to be upset with them over it. She also told me I’m wrong for snapping at her in the first place as she was just asking me to be quiet.

I can't assume that M and to-be spouse has sorted through these instances or if M ever fessed up. But I also can't assume that M has been hiding this past. 

  
Considering we aren't really that close anymore, I figured it's not my business and there's nothing for me to say. It would be really strange and awkward if I asked M about it coming out of nowhere. I wouldn't consider directly talking with the to-be spouse because I barely know them as well. But WIBTA for not saying anything?",0.0,1.0322805643081665,1,0

155,1f8fm16,AITA for uninviting my friend from my quinceanera?,"
(For anyone who doesn't know what a quinceanera is, it's basically just a BIG celebration for a girl's 15th birthday.)

Here's who I'll be mentioning today since it might get a bit confusing:
Me
J(the uninvited)
F and C (my best friends)


J has done quite a bit of stuff in the past to me and my friend group. Here's a list:

1. Made a groupchat and got upset that me and C weren't talking that much in it. (I was busy and C was struggling with depression. I cried a lot that week.)

2. talk behind our backs to F (F was never on her side and told me about this before so she's cool dw)

3. Stopped talking to all of us for about a week over the summer (we tried talking to her multiple times and she was online so? She said it was because she was upset with who she was on a trip but she could have told us this before and we wouldn't have gotten so worried and upset)


5. Stopped talking to us for a whole week during the new school year, and turned out she went to a different school out of town without telling anyone.

#5 happened not too long ago and I was the only one J told this news to. Here's what she sent me(word for word):

Yk what I'm sorry.
I'm sorry(my name).
I'm sorry to all of y'all.
I want to you specifically this because I want you to hear it I don't know why.
I feel like you'd be the best to tell and hear this
If you want you can tell the others. 
Ik you're ur asleep but yeah,
I'm sorry for not telling any of y'all I moved to (city name). which is why I'm not showing up to school and why someone else is in my seat.
I started school yesterday and I'm sorry for not telling y'all. 
I promise we can still be friends but I don't think we are going to be that close anymore.
I already felt like we were drifting apart but I promise I'll still care and everything for you and we can still hangout whenever ❤️.
I love you (my name), again I'm sorry for not telling y'all.
I'm glad we are friends.


This is the point that made me realize that I honestly don't even care for her anymore, in fact, none of our friends care anymore. Me and F talked and we noticed that Everytime there was some ""drama"" in our friend group, J started it, and she always played victim. When I show the message to my mom, she said that J sounded fake. C told me that J most likely only told me #5 because J knew that I wasn't going to be mean about it and more supportive while C would've been mean and F would've left her on read.

AITA? should I give this friendship another chance or should I tell her that I don't want to see her anymore? How should I tell her?

(For context he isn't my bfs biological brother but someone his mother introduced to him )

 So, my boyfriend  got sick and i accompanied him to the er, he was a short on money for the bills. So, i asked one of my friends to lend 4k Nepalese rupees. Since it was late at night i had to return home. so, i did some of the paper works and left my phone with him so he could use it for the mobile banking. His brother arrived from another city 20 min away (for context he was admitted at 11pm and his brother arrived at 5 in the morning). He transferred the 4k in his brothers account and his brother paid for the bills which was 3800.(Mobile banking isn't available in gov hospitals in nepal u have to use cash)My bfs parents are divorced and both are in abroad. 

Later in the morning his mom sent 8k to the brother for hospital bills. he used up 3k for the lab tests and other money wasn't used. So, here is the problem when my bf asked his brother for remaining 4k (cause i had to give it back to my friend ) his brother said "" no! i dont have it i haven't received it"" so balantly he starts arguing abt all lil favours he has
 done for my bf like letting him borrow used rice cooker and some pillows and bed sheets. (For context-apparently that so called brother and his mom were actually dating 👁️👄👁️)

 That was a big shock to my bf and he told her to block him which she did. After two weeks that brother's mom came to my place where lives in rent with his biological younger brother and asked for the rice cooker back she also took all the bed sheets and pillows. She then again came a week later and asked for a new rice cooker cause she said"" it doesn't work and its rusty"" the rice cooker works and it wasnt rust just a lil dust which could be cleaned. She apparently told his brother ""if your mom was good maybe you would have turned out a lil good  (it may not be that bad in eng but in nepali its a really bad insult ).

 (Another context between the two weeks my bf didn't asked for any money and decided to let it be since he was grateful that he came to help in the er) .

After hearing wat the mom said to my bfs brother  and all that unpaid money i was really pissed and texted him to stop being such a petty b***. The brother is blaming me for coming  in an argument  between them but my bf is taking my side and standing up to that brother. So, AITA ?

157,1f8ffdd,AITA because I don’t like my spouse messaging his best friend’s girlfriend all the time?,"My husband and I are friends with another couple, we will call them Kyle and Ally. My husband and Kyle have been friends for years and years before us women ever came into the picture. My husband and I have been together for over 10 years. Kyle and Ally have been together for 2. We all hangout all the time and always get along well. 

Kyle and ally have a huge age gap of 19 years difference. My husband gives Kyle crap over it all the time in a joking way. My husband and ally always tease each other and act like brother and sisters do pestering each other. 

A little TMI but it’s relevant, when I am on my period I can’t make major decisions or impulse decisions. My head is not clear and I get very depressed during the week I’m on my period. My moods change drastically and everything feels like my world is crashing. My husband even said he knows to not talk about major things during “that week.” 

This past week I was on my period when us 4 got invited to a small gathering with other friends. I noticed my husband messaging someone back and forth. We don’t go through each others phones. But I curiously asked who he was talking to. He said Ally. I said, “really?” I noticed the message thread went on and on and on so I said “you sure do message each other a lot.” It bothered me a little bit. Yes, that is a little jealously, I won’t lie. My husband said “it’s all crap talking and memes we send each other and she does most of the sending I just respond.” I said “she doesn’t talk or send me anything like that.” It made me feel like if it wasn’t for me being married to my husband, they wouldn’t have anything to do with me at all. Again, a little jealously and lack of self esteem on top of being on my period). It turned into kind of a heated argument because my husband thinks I’m being jealous of Ally and thinks that I am thinking he isn’t being faithful. I told him I wanted him to at least stop replying as much.

 Well today, my husband told me that he told Kyle in person, to “tell Ally to stop messaging me, my wife doesn’t like it.” 

Now Ally is probably going to think I hate her and that I’m a super jealous wife when the reality is, I am a jealous wife but I don’t want them out of our lives. I started crying when my husband told me that. I like Ally fine and don’t want her to think I think she likes my husband or is trying to steal him from me. I’m upset because I wish my husband would have talked to me first after the argument about how to solve this problem instead of of going straight to Kyle.

We have had a few other friends stay for varying times which was fine as this was a brand new house with 3 bedrooms, a living room area and a full bathroom all upstairs so it was convenient for guests ( there was enough room for 5 guests up there even with my sn staying in his room up there). His sister, bil and their two sons never visited us here.

We recently moved close to Disney World (about 1.5 years ago) into a fixer upper house ( 4bed 3 bath). We have slowly renovated but our 4th bedroom is storage and full of tools and  master bathroom shower is not  usable so we all use the guest bath and so essentially it is a 3 bed 2.5 bath right now.

My brother has not visited us here. So we have only had at most 3 guests at once.

Now his mother, sister, bil and two sons (12 and 14) want to come  stay with us a week over christmas and then his mom will stay an additional 3 weeks after that. They will all drive down from MI. I told him a week was to long and we need a limit of 3 or 4 nights for all five of them at once.

 Three adult guests and two kids all sharing 2 bathrooms with the three of us is a lot. Not to mention only having one living area here and his sister and kids are loud and not at all well-behaved. He argued that they have a long drive and accused me of treating his family differently.  He is actually pretty mad at me bc he is used to getting his way-i am pretty easy going and just go with the flow.

160,1f9895s,AITA For quitting my college soccer team?,"I think I know the answer to this post. It is my last semester in college, and I have been looking for something to get me in shape that I will enjoy. A good fit I thought would be the soccer team on campus, which has four practices a week along with games. Pretty intense, but I enjoy soccer as a former rec player and hoped it would help me get into even better shape. Well, a few weeks ago when it came time for sports physicals, myself and a few other students showed up to an empty gym. The coach had changed the date and time through an email to previous players but failed to update the newcomers. The next week, the same happened with the two tryout dates. I should have known that this was a bad omen about the team's organization and probable short roster, but I tried out and made the team anyway. For two weeks I have been going to every practice, with less than a full team showing up concurrently.

Due to the program I am in, I have clinical sessions that took priority over games/practices for three weeks. The coach knew about my schedule crunch and made it clear that education comes first. He still had me play.

This week was the first game I could not make due to these clinical sessions, and the game had to be canceled because only 8 players could make it. On the app that the coach uses for team updates, our roster only shows 12 people. Even with a substitution, it would be difficult to get even the minimum for a full game of soccer in general. Another game later this week shares the same dilemma of only 9 players confirmed to be going.
My classmate who was on the team last year said it was the same. I was fully prepared for this season of soccer to be treated as more of a workout, with me being more of a benchwarmer at my skill level. It seems I was wrong, and I just have no desire to play 15 games over the next few months with a shorthanded team each time.

I decided to let the coach know I would not be able to participate. With my schedule, on top of the management of the team, I felt it would take an unnecessarily stressful load off of my plate. I was also having problems with reaching full-time credits (my program is full-time but ""part-time"" in terms of credits). I decided to use that as my primary reason (despite not being entirely true), telling my coach that I had my last prereq. credit completed and would no longer be able to reach ""full-time"" status to play on the team. He messaged back and said nothing could be done, and the team was already short-handed so they did not need this. I wrote back and apologized again and thanked him for a good season, which was met with the same. I can't help but feel bad about letting the team down, but another part of me thinks that I should not have to be the glue that holds the team together for a successful season. Was I wrong?

I should have known that this was a bad omen about the team's organization and probable short roster, but I tried out and made the team anyway. For two weeks I have been going to every practice, with less than a full team showing up concurrently.

Due to the program I am in, I have clinical sessions that took priority over games/practices for three weeks. The coach knew about my schedule crunch and made it clear that education comes first. He still had me play.

This week was the first game I could not make due to these clinical sessions, and the game had to be canceled because only 8 players could make it. On the app that the coach uses for team updates, our roster only shows 12 people. Even with a substitution, it would be difficult to get even the minimum for a full game of soccer in general. Another game later this week shares the same dilemma of only 9 players confirmed to be going.
My classmate who was on the team last year said it was the same. I was fully prepared for this season of soccer to be treated as more of a workout, with me being more of a benchwarmer at my skill level. It seems I was wrong, and I just have no desire to play 15 games over the next few months with a shorthanded team each time.

I decided to let the coach know I would not be able to participate. With my schedule, on top of the management of the team, I felt it would take an unnecessarily stressful load off of my plate. I was also having problems with reaching full-time credits (my program is full-time but ""part-time"" in terms of credits). I decided to use that as my primary reason (despite not being entirely true), telling my coach that I had my last prereq. credit completed and would no longer be able to reach ""full-time"" status to play on the team. He messaged back and said nothing could be done, and the team was already short-handed so they did not need this. I wrote back and apologized again and thanked him for a good season, which was met with the same. I can't help but feel bad about letting the team down, but another part of me thinks that I should not have to be the glue that holds the team together for a successful season. Was I wrong?

TLDR: I quit my college soccer team with an already short roster, and was dishonest about my reasoning. AITA?",1.0,1.0444258451461792,1,1
