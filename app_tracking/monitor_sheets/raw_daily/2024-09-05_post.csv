0,1f9ptq1,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to sleep in the living room so my parents and siblings can have more space,"Hey this is an update to the post I made since some people are curious!

I think I painted my parents in a pretty bad light in that post so my bad. They really aren‚Äôt crazy psychos focused on procreating (an sgean messaged me this and they are NOT siaolangs knn). I'm from singapore, not the usa or israel or whatever other countries people suspected. Everyone telling me to move out, that really never happens and my parents definitely won‚Äôt be kicking me out the moment I sign on for the military. Here it‚Äôs very common to stay with your parents until you manage to get public housing or get married. Plus they are chinese so you know asian values they believe that I shouldn‚Äôt leave home until I get married lol. 

I want to clarify the orientation of the rooms we will be using. Basically the old room me and my brother shared was only big enough for a closet and a bed with a pullout. It kind of looks like this: https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/slaekt-underbed-with-storage-white-s79239452/ and the new room is a little smaller than my old one, so I thought my sister would just have to share mattress with my brother. I usually work in the living room or the library and I never had a desk in my room so that wasn‚Äôt really a big problem for me.

I thought some of the suggestions some of you gave were good. My parents originally didn't want to get a bunk bed because they think it's expensive. However, after much persuasion they finally agreed. So I‚Äôll sleep on top and my brother and sister can sleep at the bottom with an extra mattress at the side. Someone messaged me a nice model for a bunk bed so thanks to whoever you are coz I‚Äôll probably be buying that one. Then we‚Äôll sell the old bed frame to pay for the bunk. 

At least I found a good compromise. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice and potential solutions. Hopefully I wont fall of the bunk bed üóøüóø

1,1f9l89l,AITA for telling my husband no he can't go climbing and has to help with home reno first ,"I plan to show my husband the responses so please be as honest as possible. 

My (36F) husband (38m) and I decided to renovate the bathroom because there was water damage from a toilet that had been leaking. It was mostly my idea to renovate but not just for aesthetics, mold was growing at the bottom of the vanity, sheetrock, etc. 
He agreed to renovate but really had very little interest in the process. He has untreated ADHD and does not enjoy home maintenance (not speculation, he tells me this).

With that being said it became my job to apply for loans, search for contractors, schedule the contractors to come, etc. It's A LOT of mental work. I did it alone. 

He did agree to save money and offered to demo the bathroom himself. I was hesitant at first because he is not usually motivated to do things in the house and also due to the ADHD his timeline and processing speed is very slow and often time things don't get down. He promised me many times he wanted to do it. I sent screenshots of the calendar and told him the days he would start. The whole week leading up to demo day I mentally prepare him. We've been together for 21 years. I know how he is. He'll say he forgot or it'll seem like brand new information to him so every day he gets a reminder. 

Fast forward to last night, the night before demo is to start he sends me a message asking if he can go climbing with his friends. I said I'd prefer if he would just demo like we agreed. He only has 2 days off. So I said no, sorry, you can't go.

It turned into almost an hour argument back and forth about how the weather won't be good the rest of the days and he can just do it then. But I know him. He waits until the last minute and sometigng may go wrong. We may need to call for extra help or something. I always have a sense of urgency and he has none and it makes my life very difficult. 

To add, he has a job where he can often do his hobbies. He climbs with his work friends, goes hiking, skiing, etc. When he has days off he goes for bike rides for hours. He is absolutely not deprived of leisure time but I am. I have been home all summer (I'm a teacher) being responsible for my kids 90% of the time. Being up with them in the morning, taking them out for activities all day, and putting them to sleep. On top of that I have cleaned up after the kids and his messes every single day. I haven't had a day of fun the entire summer. So I feel anger and resentment constantly. 

Our fight ended with him telling me it makes no sense to tell him he has to start on this day, he'll just do it the next day. I'm the one being unreasonable and everyone else will agree with him and not me. Also, to add today is Thursday. Our tile guy comes in on Monday and the entire bathroom needs to be completely gutted by the morning.
