0,1f9ptq1,UPDATE: AITA for refusing to sleep in the living room so my parents and siblings can have more space,"Hey this is an update to the post I made since some people are curious!

I think I painted my parents in a pretty bad light in that post so my bad. They really aren‚Äôt crazy psychos focused on procreating (an sgean messaged me this and they are NOT siaolangs knn). I'm from singapore, not the usa or israel or whatever other countries people suspected. Everyone telling me to move out, that really never happens and my parents definitely won‚Äôt be kicking me out the moment I sign on for the military. Here it‚Äôs very common to stay with your parents until you manage to get public housing or get married. Plus they are chinese so you know asian values they believe that I shouldn‚Äôt leave home until I get married lol. 

I want to clarify the orientation of the rooms we will be using. Basically the old room me and my brother shared was only big enough for a closet and a bed with a pullout. It kind of looks like this: https://www.ikea.com/sg/en/p/slaekt-underbed-with-storage-white-s79239452/ and the new room is a little smaller than my old one, so I thought my sister would just have to share mattress with my brother. I usually work in the living room or the library and I never had a desk in my room so that wasn‚Äôt really a big problem for me.

I thought some of the suggestions some of you gave were good. My parents originally didn't want to get a bunk bed because they think it's expensive. However, after much persuasion they finally agreed. So I‚Äôll sleep on top and my brother and sister can sleep at the bottom with an extra mattress at the side. Someone messaged me a nice model for a bunk bed so thanks to whoever you are coz I‚Äôll probably be buying that one. Then we‚Äôll sell the old bed frame to pay for the bunk. 

At least I found a good compromise. Thanks to everyone who gave me advice and potential solutions. Hopefully I wont fall of the bunk bed üóøüóø

1,1f9l89l,AITA for telling my husband no he can't go climbing and has to help with home reno first ,"I plan to show my husband the responses so please be as honest as possible. 

My (36F) husband (38m) and I decided to renovate the bathroom because there was water damage from a toilet that had been leaking. It was mostly my idea to renovate but not just for aesthetics, mold was growing at the bottom of the vanity, sheetrock, etc. 
He agreed to renovate but really had very little interest in the process. He has untreated ADHD and does not enjoy home maintenance (not speculation, he tells me this).

With that being said it became my job to apply for loans, search for contractors, schedule the contractors to come, etc. It's A LOT of mental work. I did it alone. 

He did agree to save money and offered to demo the bathroom himself. I was hesitant at first because he is not usually motivated to do things in the house and also due to the ADHD his timeline and processing speed is very slow and often time things don't get down. He promised me many times he wanted to do it. I sent screenshots of the calendar and told him the days he would start. The whole week leading up to demo day I mentally prepare him. We've been together for 21 years. I know how he is. He'll say he forgot or it'll seem like brand new information to him so every day he gets a reminder. 

Fast forward to last night, the night before demo is to start he sends me a message asking if he can go climbing with his friends. I said I'd prefer if he would just demo like we agreed. He only has 2 days off. So I said no, sorry, you can't go.

It turned into almost an hour argument back and forth about how the weather won't be good the rest of the days and he can just do it then. But I know him. He waits until the last minute and sometigng may go wrong. We may need to call for extra help or something. I always have a sense of urgency and he has none and it makes my life very difficult. 

To add, he has a job where he can often do his hobbies. He climbs with his work friends, goes hiking, skiing, etc. When he has days off he goes for bike rides for hours. He is absolutely not deprived of leisure time but I am. I have been home all summer (I'm a teacher) being responsible for my kids 90% of the time. Being up with them in the morning, taking them out for activities all day, and putting them to sleep. On top of that I have cleaned up after the kids and his messes every single day. I haven't had a day of fun the entire summer. So I feel anger and resentment constantly. 

Our fight ended with him telling me it makes no sense to tell him he has to start on this day, he'll just do it the next day. I'm the one being unreasonable and everyone else will agree with him and not me. Also, to add today is Thursday. Our tile guy comes in on Monday and the entire bathroom needs to be completely gutted by the morning.

2,1fa10q1,AITA for not telling my son about my old career as a model?,"I (39F) am mum to Charlie (15M). Lately he argues with me about everything being a teenager, but otherwise we have a very close relationship. 

Now I work in the hotel industry and have been for the last couple of years, but during college and a bit after, when I was 17-22, I worked part-time as a model, mainly for lingerie and swimwear brands but also a little for some men's magazines. During that time, I had several nude photoshoots done, the pictures from which still exist, which aren't a big deal to me or my husband and have never impacted my life. My son doesn't know about my modelling career not because I was ashamed of it but it just didn't feel important, and also I felt that he was a bit young to see those photos.

Well on Monday, Charlie came home from school really pissed and picked up a fight with me as soon as he entered the house. Apparently, some boys in his school have a crush on me and often tease him about me, and recently they googled me in detail and found my old modelling photos, which they shared among each other and also showed Charlie. He says he's extremely embarrassed that all his peers saw me like that and make lewd comments and the pics have spread through the school. He yelled at me for never telling me about my career so he could prepare himself. He also made some nasty comments about me regarding those photos which was heartbreaking coming from my child, but I let that slide since I understand he's upset right now.

3,1fa0uei,AITA for eating 'too' much food in the house,"I'm 15M. I must go to the bus at about 6 and get home at about 3. My family goes to sleep late as fuck and doesn't have a bus to attend to in the morning. I want to eat about 3 eggs in the morning but I get shit for it because we are poor and granted we are. Eggs cost 10 dollars and hold 12 eggs. We are 5 people including me.  
We can't just buy more eggs, it's not in our budget.  
I get called a selfish narcissist that doesn't do anything around the house unless I'm told to ( holy shit do you expect me to do shit I don't normally want to do unless told otherwise?). Not only that but they ass pull examples like not taking out the trash which is pretty fucking annoying because it rarely happens. When it does it's because these people fill the bin too fucking fast.  
You see I'm a growing boy and I need to eat a normal diet. I've been working out almost every day doing push-ups, lifting weights, etc for a few years now. But realistically the thing that has been holding me back is this abysmal fucking diet I can't change. I tested that theory a few months ago during the summer. I stayed in my dad's house for a while and got way bulkier and my gains actually sort of amounted to something and I wasn't a skinny fat chud autist fuck. I have a lot of body dysmorphia because I'm weak and ugly as shit.  
Inb4 someone thinks, 'Oh this guy should just move to his dad's house' and the even more insane one 'this guy should call cps!' and the minor one ' this guy should use food stamps!'.  
Can't, I'm not calling the CPS on my fucking mom, and yes we DO use food stamps.

I've also heard cook your own food. 1 I don't know how to prepare shit 2 there's nothing in the freezer 3 When there is I can't eat it because we need to spread it out like metal gear rations.  
I've heard my dad and stepmom tell me to start working and getting my own food. I can't do that until the summer, and it's very likely I will not be allowed to buy my own food.  
The issue is more complex but this is the most I can elaborate about.  
I am finally posting this because my mom and step dad got pissed at me for 'wasting' more eggs today after I decided to make eggs for a lunch since I want to sleep early like i've been doing every day almost now, and also because food hadn't been prepared yet. Also I only eat one meal a day not counting breakfast which I don't eat.  
I know I sound like the good guy here but maybe I really am an ungrateful little prick. Regardless i have no power in this situation  
EDIT: I'm going to get a job on the weekends at my nearby supermarket. Fuck my excuses, I need to learn how to stop being a little bitch. You are right u/Vapin-All-Day , I am the asshole.

4,1f9zrzz,AITA for not helping my mom cook for an event? ,"


My sister and niece asked my mom (f65) if she could contribute to an event they are having by making a traditional Mexican dish. The food they requested is very tedious and takes long to prepare. The problem is my mom doesn‚Äôt have a kitchen to cook in. She has a property but only has a small RV she ripped apart and made it into a huge bedroom. No bath and no kitchen. She is a single woman that depends on herself financially. I recently got her onto a side hustle which she has made into her full time job and she does it all day. When my niece asked her for the favor she couldn‚Äôt say no, and of course they didn‚Äôt take into account that she has no where to make the food. I brought it up to my sister and asked her if she was aware that she doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to cook. She quickly said ‚Äúwell she can go to your house.‚Äù I said well maybe she can go to hers and she said no she doesn‚Äôt have time. My mom called me and asked me to go ahead and start on the food and she would come to start preparing it. Mind you the event is four days away. I told her it was too soon and I had other things I needed to do. She responded to just go ahead and get it started so it can be ready. I was upset because I had some good news come in and was planning on having a little celebratory dinner with my little family. Well needless to say I was in the kitchen all day and she never came. On top of everything I still have mommy duties. This morning she called me as usual to see if I started everything and I said yes but that she needs to tell my sister that next time she request her cooking she needs to do it at her house and she can help prepare this dish. My mom got upset and said I was making a big deal of nothing and I was complaining too much. I told her I‚Äôll just go ahead and talk to my sister and she got defensive and said ‚Äúno don‚Äôt tell your sister anything, leave her alone and just help me with this.‚Äù  I said I would help but she needs to learn to tell my sister no when she asks for things. My mom never tells her no and they always include me without asking. The other problem is that she is addicted to her side hustle and does not take time off to get things done. Therefore, she was gonna leave me hanging making pretty much everything and I still have to clean after. I talked to my sister and she also went off on me saying that I had time because I‚Äôm a sahm. So is she but she doesn‚Äôt have babies and she just doesn‚Äôt like to be inconvenienced. I said why can‚Äôt she do it at her house and she said she doesn‚Äôt wanna deal with all the mess and they were already having the event there. They are both mad at me but I don‚Äôt feel responsible for any of this. 

I feel really guilty now for putting my mom in an awkward position and now I feel like the bad guy. But I didn‚Äôt sign up for it and I‚Äôm tired of being a doormat and being ignored. So AITA? ",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-05,"AITA for not helping my mom cook for an event?

6,1f9zf3k,AITA for calling my mom a thief?,"I wanna preface this by saying that, firstly, I'm not the best daughter and that my mom always has to reprimand me for not doing my work around the house, so maybe that has a part in how she reacted and also that this happened around an hour and a half ago. Still I feel really bad and am wondering if I should apologize.

So yesterday, I (17F), looked at my checking account and noticed $40+ was taken out of my account (which isn't a lot to most, but I'm pretty broke since I don't get paid that much). I didn't think too much of it at the time for some reason, thinking I accidentally spent money or something??

I live in one of those ingredient households, where there are ingredients to make food, but they don't go together in a meal (if that makes sense). So, when I got in from school I looked at my account again, but I really couldn't put my finger on where the money had gone. But instead of asking where it went, like someone with a brain, I called my mom and asked her to send me money. She said no and I hung up.

When I looked back at my account, I finally realized that my mom is the only person who can access my account and not only deposit money but withdraw it too. I called her back and asked if she withdrew the money from my account to which she answered yes. When I asked if she could send my money back however, she said no, then reprimanded me again for not doing chores. I feel like this is where I messed up though, because I let my emotions get the best of me. Instead of saying okay or whatever I hung up the phone on her without saying goodbye.

She got back home a little after that phone call ended and when she came in I asked if she could please return my money. She gave it back and I thought that was the end of it but she got really mad and started cursing, about how she ""pays all the bills"" and ""has to do everything as a single mother"".

I was still upset at my mom for taking my money so I said something along the lines of the fact that I was just upset she took my money without telling me and that if she'd told me I'd be alright with it because I lend her money all the time. Then I said, ""If I took money from you without telling, you'd be really angry and it'd be a crime. That's called theft."" And I didn't think it was possible for her to get even more upset, but she did. She started going on about how she'd close my account and I could go ask my dad for money or something.

Anyway, it seems like she's just as upset as I am about this because I can hear her yelling on the phone about it in her room, so AITA? Should I apologize?

So yesterday, I (17F), looked at my checking account and noticed $40+ was taken out of my account (which isn't a lot to most, but I'm pretty broke since I don't get paid that much). I didn't think too much of it at the time for some reason, thinking I accidentally spent money or something??

I live in one of those ingredient households, where there are ingredients to make food, but they don't go together in a meal (if that makes sense). So, when I got in from school I looked at my account again, but I really couldn't put my finger on where the money had gone. But instead of asking where it went, like someone with a brain, I called my mom and asked her to send me money. She said no and I hung up.

When I looked back at my account, I finally realized that my mom is the only person who can access my account and not only deposit money but withdraw it too. I called her back and asked if she withdrew the money from my account to which she answered yes. When I asked if she could send my money back however, she said no, then reprimanded me again for not doing chores. I feel like this is where I messed up though, because I let my emotions get the best of me. Instead of saying okay or whatever I hung up the phone on her without saying goodbye.

She got back home a little after that phone call ended and when she came in I asked if she could please return my money. She gave it back and I thought that was the end of it but she got really mad and started cursing, about how she ""pays all the bills"" and ""has to do everything as a single mother"".

I was still upset at my mom for taking my money so I said something along the lines of the fact that I was just upset she took my money without telling me and that if she'd told me I'd be alright with it because I lend her money all the time. Then I said, ""If I took money from you without telling, you'd be really angry and it'd be a crime. That's called theft."" And I didn't think it was possible for her to get even more upset, but she did. She started going on about how she'd close my account and I could go ask my dad for money or something.

Anyway, it seems like she's just as upset as I am about this because I can hear her yelling on the phone about it in her room, so AITA? Should I apologize?

7,1f9zaym,AITA for wanting equal share in my own company?," I (41F) bought a company with a co-worker of mine (68M). The company belonged to our boss who was dying of cancer. His children didn't want anything to do with the company so we bought it.
At the time of purchase our boss was doing the negotiations since we were purchasing the business from him. He gave us a deal that we could pay him in installments and the contract stated that if the company went under we did not have to pay him whatever was left of the money. He also asked for interest of 30% in the first year's profit, 20% second year and 10% on the 3rd. He also said there would be a 10% management fee which would only be split between me and my partner, (we'll call him Bob). 
Then my boss calls me one day and says the contract was almost ready and we had to just talk about how much we were paying Bob. I said we will give him a few extra dollars on the payroll since I knew he does a little extra work. My boss said that wasn't enough and said out of the 10% management fee he would get more. (I assumed 45/55% or 40/60%). When the first year's profit comes out I see the split of 75/25%! I was furious. This is where I may be the a*hole because when I'm mad I start cursing. Out of $10k I get $2500?! 
Soon after boss takes a turn and passes away. I dropped the subject in respect of their grief. Then last year Bob gives me a sob story about that's how the boss wanted it. Tries also to negotiate with me saying that if I do his job and he does mine then he give me 80% of the 10%. 
This year is almost coming to a close and I decided to hire a lawyer to send a letter to Bob telling him to drop the 10% management fee or go to court. I haven't done it yet but just the mention of the 10% to Bob and it sparks an argument. We put in the same $30k to buy the company. I happen to have more computer and work skills then him and he still insists that he works more than I do. He is working while I'm working which shouldn't be because we have 6 hour shifts. I can't stop him from working when he does. We work from home. All I want is for the profit to be 50/50. Am I the a*hole?
PS. When boss died we went to a lawyer and signed a contract that says everything is split 50/50. Bob was afraid that I would bail and leave him with the debt to the widow.

12,1f9yvjp,AITA for refusing to interview my cousin for a position at my company?,"I (27M) finished my Bachelor's 6 years ago. Right after graduating I worked as a software engineer at Facebook for a year, got a job at a hedge fund and worked there for three years, got burned out, took a few months off, and founded a company around 1.5 years ago.

My little cousin Meera (22F), bless her bleeding heart, has always been my biggest supporter. When I was at Facebook she'd frequently remind me that my employer is a cancer and I'm working to make the world worse. When I was at the hedge fund she'd always remind me that I'm paid a boatload to contribute nothing to society. When I started my own company, she said that she hoped my hedge fund would take me back when the AI hype wave died off and my company went under. 

Anyways, we're currently interviewing for a lead designer. I guess the new grad job market must be tough because earlier this week we found Meera's profile in our applicant portal. My uncle messaged me later letting me know that she had applied and it would be great if we could interview her. I replied that I'm flattered by her application but unfortunately we're hiring for a lead with more experience. He said we could still hire her to work under the design lead. I said we're not looking to hire junior designers at the moment but we'll keep her in mind as we grow.

My uncle then sent a link to an article about my company's funding and said I certainly have budget to hire her.

And also it's unprofessional that her father is messaging me on her behalf when she could be asking me herself.

He didn't message me after that but Meera sent me a snarky text saying she didn't realize I was so sensitive and she's sorry she offended me.

Edit: We had a talk before we signed a lease about what was expected and things we don‚Äôt want to bend on. She‚Äôs disregarded all of that and doesn‚Äôt want to talk about it further as of right now. We are in a couple different clubs together so going out on bad terms would not be preferred. I have emailed the leasing company about if subleasing is allowed so don‚Äôt know about that option at the moment. ",0.0,-0.0044789500534534454,0,1
16,1f9xrhi,AITA for criticizing a girl who ruined the stageplay?,"Me (17M) and my friend who I will call Amy (16F) are members of theater troupe outside of school which performs musicals and other stageplays. 

Recently a new guy ( I'll call him Rob 17M) joined cast of our new play alongside with his friend who I will call Natalie (16F)

Unfortunately despite eveything going well in rehearsal the stageplay turned out to be a huge fucking fail. During the scene where Natalie was supposed to have a solo moment, she just froze on stage and didn't speak at all. I started telling her that she should do something but she just didn't move. I wanted to improvise but then Rob just went on stage and just summarized the events of the scene to the audience instead and told us to skip this scene. I guess you all can imagine that audience wasn't impressed with this absolute shitshow that was going on stage and it looked like everyone fucking didn't even rehearse and forgot their roles.

Afterwards I called Natalie out for forgetting her lines and she tried to apologize, I was mad at her and I yelled that I don't wanna hear any apologies rn. She also said that she didn't forget her lines but she couldn't speak to the audience because she had a bad stage fright and got too stressed because of too many people watching. To which I told her that if she's too scared to face the audience she shouldn't even try to be an actor. 

After what I said Natalie started crying and left, Rob kept defending her ass and he told me I went too far with critizing her and that I shouldn't call her out because she already feels guilty and because she's my fellow actress in the cast I should support her instead. I snapped at him because this play was important to me, and he accused me of being selfish and only caring about how I feel. Then he started insulting my acting skills and said that I don't have what it takes to be a star and that he quits the cast.

Amy tried to calm me down and assured me that she had a lot of fun during a play and asked me if I feel the same, I yelled that I didn't have any fucking fun because I was stressing about play being terrible. 

I think it was reasonable that I got mad at Natalie but now I feel that I might have acted like a jerk because Amy is still upset after how I acted after the play and she said that she lost motivation for theater because last play left everyone unhappy.

18,1f9x95d,AITA I insulted my dad's friend's sister,"My parents are split up and for some reason, my dad's best friend seems obsessed with fixing him up with somebody. Women he's worked with, his exes and at one point his sister.

My dad is somewhat invested with this friend. I live about 20 miles from where I work, when my car was booked in to the garage he said he'd take me to the bus stop, not straight to work, a couple of weeks earlier he had driven his friend 100, his friend's daughter was moving house or something. 

My mother finds this a strange way for his friend to be acting and thinks that he might have an agenda.

No that's being unfair, a lot more masculine. I personaly think the friend was trying to get his sister in to my ancestral home.

Now, his sister has, I think two grown up children. And the family are not the best of people. The two kids used to steal video games from their cousins, the sons of my dad's friend. I know this because his friends told me that his nephews and neices are thieves. At one point he got his son a game for Christmas, they were up for Christmas and took the game. I think He had the three Spiro games for the PS1, they disappeared. He saw the three games at their house and his sister said she bought them for her kids. 

So not the type of people I'd want living in my ancestral home.

I said as much when he was talking about trying to get my dad to date her. That aside from my dad not being interested, I wouldn't feel comfortable with her and her kids being in and out of the house.

He was offended.

For some reason when he was gone my dad actually defended her, saying they had probably thought it was okay because it was family they might not have viewed it as actually stealing. Yup, I'm the bad guy, his friend can do no wrong. I replied that I felt the opposite, that if her and her dodge family would steal from their cousins then who wouldn't they steal from?

19,1f9x4ns,AITA for reaching out to my ex-boyfriend and warning him about his fianc√©e?,"So, here‚Äôs the situation. My ex-boyfriend (let's call him Mike) and I have known each other since we were 12. We dated for a very short time (like three weeks) but quickly figured out that we‚Äôd be better off as friends. There was no animosity between us, and our friendship endured for years. 
However, things changed when he started dating someone else. He cut me out of his life completely. His family, who had issues with his ex-wife, actually reached out to me during that time and asked me to talk to him about it, but he didn‚Äôt listen, and we all know how that turned out‚Äîshe was emotionally abusive, and he eventually left her. 
After that relationship ended, Mike reached out to rekindle our friendship, mentioning that he regretted not listening to me and even asked me to remind him to be careful in the future. So we resumed our friendship, and it bloomed. But then he met his current fianc√©e (let‚Äôs call her Sarah), and once again, he cut me off completely. He proposed to her just months into their relationship, and honestly, I‚Äôm worried sick about him. 
From what I can see, Sarah is much worse than his ex-wife. She may not be overtly abusive, but she‚Äôs manipulative and has already started to isolate him from his family. I am still really close with his parents and they are terrified he is digging an even deeper hole than in the first marriage and has lost his self-worth completely. 
In addition to how manipulative she is, she is also 8 years younger than him, and they are in completely different stages of life. 
I‚Äôve been trying to respect their relationship and stay out of it, especially since I‚Äôm an ex, no matter how short the relationship was. But a week ago, I couldn‚Äôt hold back anymore. I messaged Mike and reminded him of what he told me before about needing to be warned if he was making a mistake again. I expressed my genuine concerns about Sarah and how I think he‚Äôs repeating the same mistakes he made in his past marriage. He is sacrificing his relationship with his ENTIRE family (they are all extremely close) and most of his friends because of someone he‚Äôs known for less than a year. His parents helped him get out of his last abusive marriage and worked really hard to build him back up. Now they are watching him walk in to yet another one. It‚Äôs heartbreaking to watch as someone who has always cared about his happiness and rooted for him to find love that builds him up rather than tears him down. I was hopeful he learned from his last relationship, but it appears he hasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ He never responded to my text but his parents confirmed he received it.

When I was 11 my dad died suddenly, now my mom has a new boyfriend. My mom says I'm being selfish and unreasonable. 
New years eve 23-24 we went to a familyfriends party to spend the night, the room I borrowed had no door and was next to the living room where my mom and her friend were talking. They started talking about how he'd said he liked her but was worried ab the fact that she had kids. I'd had a rough night, a friendship ending and hiding in the bathroom, so that might've been why I started crying. Then they started talking about fucking so I put on my headphones.
After that her new ""friend"" who we had never heard of started coming over what felt like every other day. For like four months he would come over all the time until she eventually told us that they were in fact not friends. 
At first I didn't like it bc I felt like she'd abandoned my dad. I'm over that now, I know that life goes on. 
This summer we went on a trip and the weekend before we left her bf slept over here for two days. Then we went on a two week train trip (idk what to call it). It was very intense, I have adhd and anxiety, very intense for me. Thought I was melting by the time it was over. 
When we got back she drops on me that he's coming to pick us up from the train station and then he's going to sleep over for a few days. I said please no bc I can't rest whenever he is at our house, idk why, I get tense and anxious, my resting goes backwards. She decides that he'll only sleep over one night.
A few days after that we were going to visit my grandparents who live about 4 hours away. I was happy that I was finally going to get some rest. No! Actually he's going to take the train to our grandparents a few days after us and then be there the rest of our stay. 
This had never been discussed. I get it you want him to meet your parents I UNDERSTAND but she knows this stuff is really stressful for me and didn't even talk to me about it until it was at the point where I didn't have neither a say in it nor any time to prepare mentally. 
Then he went back home with us in the car and then slept over at our place for two days until we were going on another roadtrip (this one 2-3h) to see a familyfriend which he was apparently also coming along on. I had not been informed until the day before. 
Thankfully he did not stay over after we got home from that roadtrip. 
Now see the thing is, I don't hate this guy. He's actually really nice to me and my sister. He tries and wants us to like him. The problem is I CAN'T like him bc it feels like my mom prioritises him over me and my sister.

My sister is 9 and gets the same treatment as I do. I think some of my feelings might be bc of her who everyday seems to be more and more like me. 
He just came over out of nowhere, past my limit, now I'm writing this.

26,1f9u3i9,AITA for texting my boyfriend about his behavior during his work presentation?,"AITA for texting my boyfriend about his behavior during his work presentation?

Background:

I (26) and my boyfriend (30) live together, work from home, and have separate bedrooms due to light sleeping. We also share an apartment with a cat.

On Tuesday, my boyfriend was stressed about a presentation the next morning. He planned to work late and wake up early (4am) to finalize it, which is typical for him due to his anxiety and poor time management. He often gives these presentations over Zoom from his bed.

To support him, I handled dinner, told him not to worry about cleanup, and went to bed at 9pm to avoid disturbing him. However, I struggled to sleep and was awake until around 6am. When he woke up at 4am, I went to his room to wish him luck and let him know I hadn‚Äôt slept well.

The Situation:

At 9am on Wednesday, my boyfriend woke me by throwing open my bedroom door and asking me to take care of the cat, who had been noisy during his presentation. He often wakes me up accidentally (because I‚Äôm a light sleeper and he‚Äôs loud) and on purpose (for things like asking if I want breakfast). He knows this bothers me, and I‚Äôm not a morning person, so I dislike being woken up unnecessarily.

He threw the cat into my room, woke me, and left. Upset, I texted him: ‚ÄúNext time lock him in my office so I can get more than 3 hours of sleep. Thanks. Good luck on the demo, though. But don‚Äôt do that again.‚Äù

He replied, ‚ÄúLeave me alone, dude.‚Äù I thumbed down his text but didn‚Äôt reply, thinking he might still be presenting.

After this presentation was over we had a verbal fight and he told me I had yelled and chewed him out for his presentation and since it was 9am it was reasonable for him to wake me up to help. Later, he apologized somewhat but defended waking me up and claimed that my texts distracted him and affected his performance. I think my texts were reasonable and not a reprimand. Should I have waited until after the presentation? Maybe, but I didn‚Äôt expect him to check his phone.

What frustrates me is that I‚Äôm stressed at work too, and he knew I hadn‚Äôt slept well. Despite this, he woke me to handle the cat when he could have easily put it in my office. I feel like I was considerate of his work, but his actions showed no consideration for my needs.

27,1f9tzkf,AITA for not paying for whole families tickets to my children's birthday party?,"My wife and I were discussing the birthday party ideas we had for our girls who are turning 4 and 5. I suggested we have it at a local kids museum in our city. It's a great place and would be a killer time for everyone. We're a family of 5, myself, wife, son, and our 2 daughters. I looked up the prices and it'll be roughly 250 for the 5 of us to goto the museum, that doesn't include the food for the party or anything else, just admission. Tbh that's a little more than I want to pay but for my babies it worth it.


When I suggested it and as I was looking at tickets pricing, my wife said it'd be over 500 for us to goto the museum for everyone, and I said ""what no way? I'm looking right now and it's 250"" she proceeded to tell me that's for just us but we need to include the other guests and kids as well, meaning my 2 little brothers, my dad, his wife, my mother, my wife's mother and her sister and husband. I recoiled and said ""well I think they can get their own tickets if they'd like to come""


I fully expected the extended family to come, I have no problem with that. I think they're all great and I have no problem with them. However I don't think it's my responsibility to pay for their admission to the museum. Especially when we will be having a standard party at our home as well. 


This became an issue between us as she says she thinks I'm trying to leave people out (she really just means her side of the family) which I'm absolutely not as I don't want to pay for anyone not under my roof. 


For context my wife and I are middle class, but still not middle class enough to drop over 500 dollars on a day for everyone. We do make more money than her mother, sister and her husband but none of them have any kids or responsibilities, it'd be much easier for them to buy their own single ticket than it would be for us to buy for everyone. It's basically we pay for ourselves and only ourselves or we don't go. I think thats wrong and is taking away a good time for our family because other people outside our family don't want to pony up. 


I'm pretty ready to put my foot down and tell her they pay themselves or they don't come but I don't want to be a piece of shit either, just seems like a lot on us, when it doesn't need to be. 


AITA?



EDIT: from replies I'm seeing it appears I wasn't clear. We are having a birthday party at our home for everyone. And are not charging anything or asking for people to bring anything other than a present and themselves. I thought it'd be a nice thing for us to goto the museum as well, not really have a party there but more so, enjoy an afternoon there and maybe some ice cream after. I was expecting to let everyone know, ""hey party at our house and we're going to the museum too if anybody wants to go with us"" 

Therefore I don't believe we should pay for everyone else. Id like them to come but it's ok if they dont/cant/etc. It's totally for our girls/family, not really everyone.

28,1f9tqwo,WIBTA if I don't dye my hair? (Update),"Hi guys, I have a small update to my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/dDNStclfJm) where I asked if I'm TA for not wanting to dye my black and blonde hair.

The same teacher told me 3 more times to change my hair (no other teacher said anything). I went to the principal and asked her. She said that as long as I have it tied, it will be fine.

The teacher told me to come to her class and have a talk. She explained how she's disappointed I went to the principal instead of just listening to her, and also how it's her job to keep the uniforms intact, that's why - despite liking my hair - she wants me to change it. She also said that as a Senior, younger students are taking an example from me, and if they see a senior with highlights they will think ""Hey, I can do it too then"" and it will be a mess to try to control a bunch of juniors and stop them from getting colored hair.

She gave me time till Monday to change the hair. I even asked her if I can dye the bottom (blonde) brown since I don't really want it to be full on black. Well, she agreed as long as it ""camuflages"" (?), basically doesn't stand out as much. 

Right now I'm dying my hair with the only hair due I have available at the minute (which is red-brown, turns out really dark at first but fades to ginger when you wash it). I'll buy a black hair dye and use it when the current dye fades too much. I also plan on using a Hair Dye Remover whenever I'm off from school for a week (so I have some time to fix it if it turns out bad), which will be around Halloween.

Gotta bear with black hair for two months then...

Anyways, thank you everyone who commented on my original post and advised me to tell the principal, and reassured me that barely anyone gives a crap about hair color in adult life lol

Edit: 

For those who wonder and ask what gives the teacher right to tell me all that in the first place - during the talk with me she explained it's her job given by the principal. That's why (even if she diesn't want to) she has to make sure everyone is following the dresscode and represent our school well when we're in our uniforms. That's also why whenever I told any teacher (and principal) the situation, as soon as I mentioned which teacher said it, they all agreed with her lol

30,1f9sxdu,"AITA for uninviting my friends to my party and making friends with their ""enemy""","

Let me start by saying, yes this is high school drama and life gets much harder than this, but I need to know if I am in the wrong in this situation.

There was a huge friend group fight between my friend Kelly and the rest of the girls, Peggy, Rachel, and Gloria because Kelly tends to leave them out of things she did with her other friends, she also laughed along and agreed with fatphobic comments about one of the girls, Peggy. I ghosted her for a while after everything blew up to repair the friendship between the 3 of my best friends (they were upset I didn't want to choose sides). After I cut off Kelly, I healed things with Peggy but Rachel and Gloria started ignoring me and openly judging me when we hung out. Their reason for being distant was ""they were busy"" and I didn't defend Peggy enough. I defended Peggy openly when Kelly AND GLORIA were fat-shaming her. All of this was worked out so it would make no sense to say everything is okay and proceed to hold a grudge.

Rachel and Gloria created an entire friend group including our mutual friend and a guy whom I have been close with for 5 years, and did not include Peggy or me. Not only that, but Rachel has been making Peggy and her boyfriend uncomfortable, making passive-aggressive comments, calling Peggy and her mom fat, screaming at her boyfriend in front of other people, and just being rude. Recently, I was hanging out with Peggy and she told me about the homecoming group they created and I was not added to it after they made me promise to come with them to the dances this year. Peggy and I both contacted Rachel and Gloria, Rachel didn't respond and Gloria said ""idk yet,"" which is bull shit. I don't mean to sound cocky, but I have been a great friend. I have been there for them in their time of need, constantly hosted hangouts and parties, took Rachel to Outer Banks and threw her a birthday party, paid for their food, took them to expensive dinners (paid for of course), and defended their reputation like it was my own.

So of course the disrespect of not even responding to me or explaining set me over the top. Here's where I may be the asshole... I always host an annual Halloween party that I knew my friends had been looking forward to. I told them if I was not welcome in their homecoming group, they were not welcome at my Halloween party (I did not uninvite their love interests or other friends I had already invited). No more free food, no more parties, my family no longer welcomes them into our home, no more vacations, and no more over-the-top birthday gifts. To make things even harsher, I made up with Kelly and told her what was going on and she invited me into her group and comforted me about the situation, Peggy supported my decision to go with Kelly, and Peggy left their homecoming group. I know they will be pissed when they see what group I'm in (I haven't told them), and they also don't know their friends still plan on going. Was I too harsh on them?

I told them if I was not welcome in their homecoming group, they were not welcome at my Halloween party (I did not uninvite their love interests or other friends I had already invited). No more free food, no more parties, my family no longer welcomes them into our home, no more vacations, and no more over-the-top birthday gifts. To make things even harsher, I made up with Kelly and told her what was going on and she invited me into her group and comforted me about the situation, Peggy supported my decision to go with Kelly, and Peggy left their homecoming group. I know they will be pissed when they see what group I'm in (I haven't told them), and they also don't know their friends still plan on going. Was I too harsh on them?

We already take care of 2 of our younger siblings who are both in high school. They‚Äôre both jobless and have no car to their name. My wife and I live comfortably with our younger sisters and we live in a two bedroom apartment. We had to move our younger siblings out of their rooms, we‚Äôre islanders so customs are if they‚Äôre older and in a relationship it‚Äôs ‚Äúcustom‚Äù that they should get their own room. Now the younger siblings sleep in the living room. My wife‚Äôs sister and her bf stay in ‚Äútheir‚Äù room all day eat on ‚Äútheir‚Äù bed (which I never let the girls do, ever) and only come out when the girls are at school and my wife and I are at work. All they do is eat the food my wife and I bought and hide in their room. Now before they lived with us they lived at my fathers in laws home but got kicked out for using their car one too many times without asking, before that they lived at HIS sisters house but left due to the same reason, no car. I don‚Äôt let them use my car but they claim they need it to look for jobs and what not. My wife loves her older sister deeply and would do anything for her. But honestly all I want to do is kick them out but then they‚Äôll have no where to go. AITAH?! 

Edit: I made this before work but damn thank you all for giving me your true thoughts. Let me clear up some things, our two sisters were more than happy to give up their room. We discussed it before they moved in and they didn‚Äôt mind, we have a couch that you can move and turn into a gigantic bed (that‚Äôs honestly more comfortable then my bed) that they love to sleep on when they have other family over. They have the whole living room to themselves since my wife and I have a tv in our room so we just come home and sleep and chill in there to give the girls their space. 

As for the other two well, true I have not set boundaries  and that‚Äôs on me. I will talk to them when I get home thank you all for your advice.

I also got evicted from my living situation and busy moving in to my new place while going to college for my teaching credential. So when july 10th rolls around my brother calls me angry that i forgot his sons birthday. And tells me i didnt have trouble remembering my dogs birthday three days before and proceeded to send a photo in the family group text. I got angry and responded i had alot of my plate and a two year old wouldn‚Äôt even remember or care if i acknowledged his birthday so it wasnt important.  So i responded ‚Äúwell put him on the phone, sorry, its only 5pm let me talk to him‚Äù and my brother says ‚Äúhes too distracted with his gifts‚Äù  and hung up. However, what he failed to realize is i bought a gift on Amazon a week in advance, and  was supposed to arrive a day after his birthday. Everytime i buy my brother and his wife‚Äôs children gifts i never receive a thank you. I had to text in the family group chat asking if the gifts were received. And his wife responds ‚Äúhe loves them! No thank you‚Äù. The kids are also extremely spoiled with so many toys left unopened in their closet. Its September, i went from talking everyday with my brother to not speaking to him for months‚Ä¶.sorry for the rant, my bf told me not to waste my time on people who choose not to be part of my life.

40,1f9r0e6,AITA for refusing to drive my brother to school?,"My brother (21) has a drivers license but is scared to drive so he usually has to bike or take public transportation. It normally takes him about 1.5h to get to work. Now they're renovating the train tracks which is why he has to take a bus that takes a while longer to get him to his destination. He goes to work from Monday to Thursday but on Friday he has to go to school. To get to that school he now has to switch busses multiple times and I understand that that is super annoying. I work from home most Fridays so I'm a little bit more flexible with my time.

Now this is the situation. My mom drove him to school the last two weeks because she was home but now she is back to work and told me to drive him. Normally that would not be the problem but my brother has been acting like  a complete jerk to me for the last couple weeks so I'm just not interested in driving him.

Whenever I ask him to do something for me he never does it. Couple days ago he went downstairs to get himself a bottle of water and I asked if he could bring me one too. His only response was that I should get my own. My job at home is it to do all our laundry so I folded everything in baskets (one for my parents, one for him and one for me) in the last couple of weeks I have always asked him to take my parents basket upstairs because I recently had surgery in my knee and struggle with carrying things upstairs. He's never done it so usually I end up doing it.

Then two days ago I went grocery shopping and when I came inside with the bags he had placed his slippers directly behind the door which I didn't see and tripped over with the grocery bags and ended up falling. When I told him in the evening he said that he likes that spot for his shoes and that I should have looked better... they were in the middle of the way.... you had to step over them to go somewhere.

Needless to say I'm pretty pissed about his behavior and I don't really feel like driving him when he continues to treat me that way. 

But now my mom is kind off expecting me to drive him because she told him I would without even asking me first. 

Am I in the wrong for refusing to drive him?

I have a well paid job, so I am renting a 3-room apartment, which is pretty expensive (1.4K), but normal for the area I live in. 
He moved in with me after he was laid off.
I have been paying the rent and all the utilities, the car,  and the gas 80% of the time and most part of the groceries by myself for 9 months now, which add up to half of my salary every month. He does pay his own groceries most of the time. Moreover, I paid him a vacation (accomodation and flights).
He didn't manage to find any sort of income in 9 months, except for 1 month when he worked in a call center and he was fired again, and some 3 private classes that the mother of the child decided to discontinue.
He is an engineer with little work experience and a not popular field in the job market.
I tried all this time to support him, but I am getting mad because he doesn't do anything around the house if I don't ask him.
Moreover he got speeding tickets of 300 euros that I had to pay.
Lately I got really pissed because I feel like he just expects me to pay for everything while he still has 18K in savings.
I told him to go out and network in hopes of finding a job, but he didn't. He doesn't know how to have productive conversations, although he can't talk for hours with people (which annoys me)
I told him he needs to get his life together and until that keep the house sparkling clean at least.
I also have an autoimune disease and I am chronically fatigued, so chores are a real struggle for me. 
Lately I keep seeing posts about women who provide for men, my mom also did this for my dad, and I think women are being taking advantage of big time more and more by men.  This is also not the first relationship this happens.

45,1f9pwp8,WIBTA if I didn't give my friend the profits for selling their ticket after they bailed.,"Me (25m) along with two friends, Carl (30m) and John (24m), were planning to attend a convention next month. We had gotten the tickets, planned (not booked) where to stay, and were all excited until we were hit with a bombshell: Carl was given a late invitation to a wedding that coincided with the convention. He was given the invite by his best bud for his sister's wedding and Carl feels like he has to go. With this, the group decided to cancel the trip entirely for financial reasons, but me and John are pretty upset by it while Carl is acting like he has no choice in the matter. I do understand both sides but I am still pretty bothered by it:

On Carl's side, he attended his best bud's (BB) wedding and feels obligated to go to the sister's wedding as well to be supportive. He had touched base with BB a few months ago to try to pin down dates to avoid canceling the convention but didn't get a straight answer until a couple days ago. While he could refuse to attend the wedding, he doesn't want to upset BB since marriage, in most cases, is a once in a lifetime event while this convention is yearly.

On me and John's end, we had touched base as a group months ago to make sure there were no obligations people had to worry about and Carl said he should be good. Additionally, we missed going last year since Carl had a different wedding he had to attend, though that one he knew about earlier in the year. John also argued that since BB's sister waited so long to send out invites, her and BB shouldn't expected Carl to attend if he has other plans and Carl choosing the wedding is a metaphorical slap in the face since we did our due diligence while BB's sister did not.

Now the issue: we are a bit upset that Carl bailed for the second time and now that we are cancelling the trip, we are planning to sell off out tickets. Because the tickets are sold out, 3rd party sites are up charging them for almost 2x the cost. I am not a scalper, but I was planning to sell the tickets for a bit more than I got them at to recoup the expenses (John obtained an addon service for $150 for example) and, if there were any profits, pocketing them for myself. Because of the inconvenience, I was thinking of splitting the profit with John but I refuse to give any profit to Carl since he didn't put any effort in acquiring the tickets and is the reason we are cancelling (didn't have anyone to take his spot). For more info, the ticket cost would still be around $100 less each than what 3rd party's are selling them for. WIBTA if I didn't give Carl any of the profits?

EDIT: to clarify, the person getting married is Carl‚Äôs best friend‚Äôs sister. Additionally, I paid for the tickets up front them gave each of them a ticket after they paid their share. Carl's ticket was given back to me and I already repaid him for his portion.

EDIT 2: thank you all for the feedback. Regarding the question of why me and John don't go, I did offer that option to John.

46,1f9pfep,AITAH for honking at a bus picking up kids,"The week of Labor Day, I was driving into work around 8AM. Around this time is when school busses have been going out picking up students to go to school. While driving on one of the main roads, I was behind a school bus. Whenever the school bus stops, I make sure to provide about 3 car lengths distance, just in case of the school bus needing to reverse for whatever reason (My old high school bus did that when dropping off kids in my old neighborhood). When the bus stopped, I saw it picking up elementary age kids. With them were 2 adults. When the kids walked to the bus, the adults followed. I understood because, as a father, I could see wanting to make sure the kids got on safe. After the kids were on the bus, the adults stayed by the bus and started talking to the driver. Maybe they wanted to make them aware of something or ask a question. Didn't seem like a big deal. HOWEVER......

10 Minutes later.

The adults are still talking with the bus driver. I don't know what the conversation was, but 10 minutes had passed from when the bus stopped to pick up the kids. This was only a 2 lane road so the bus was stopping traffic going both ways. The number of cars that were backed up went farther than I could see (when we finally moved, the cars went back almost a half a mile or more). At this point, I thought it was ridicules the amount of time it took for this conversation, especially when you have traffic stopped going both ways. So I honked my horn to signal that there was a lot of cars waiting to go but couldn't because the bus had the stop sign on. Keep in mind, I could see through the back bus door and all the kids were in and sitting within seconds of getting on the bus. Then other cars started to honk as well. One lady then backed up to look my direction and gave the hand up signal to say, ""hold on, I heard you,"" but still continued to converse. I did honk again because at this point, in my mind, this is a conversation to have when you are not blocking a road. The bus then left and we could all resume going.

I have to ask, ""Am I the Ass Hole for honking at the bus?""",Not the A-hole,2024-09-05,"AITAH for honking at a bus picking up kids The week of Labor Day, I was driving into work around 8AM. Around this time is when school busses have been going out picking up students to go to school. While driving on one of the main roads, I was behind a school bus. Whenever the school bus stops, I make sure to provide about 3 car lengths distance, just in case of the school bus needing to reverse for whatever reason (My old high school bus did that when dropping off kids in my old neighborhood). When the bus stopped, I saw it picking up elementary age kids. With them were 2 adults. When the kids walked to the bus, the adults followed. I understood because, as a father, I could see wanting to make sure the kids got on safe. After the kids were on the bus, the adults stayed by the bus and started talking to the driver. Maybe they wanted to make them aware of something or ask a question. Didn't seem like a big deal. HOWEVER......

10 Minutes later.

The adults are still talking with the bus driver. I don't know what the conversation was, but 10 minutes had passed from when the bus stopped to pick up the kids. This was only a 2 lane road so the bus was stopping traffic going both ways. The number of cars that were backed up went farther than I could see (when we finally moved, the cars went back almost a half a mile or more). At this point, I thought it was ridicules the amount of time it took for this conversation, especially when you have traffic stopped going both ways. So I honked my horn to signal that there was a lot of cars waiting to go but couldn't because the bus had the stop sign on. Keep in mind, I could see through the back bus door and all the kids were in and sitting within seconds of getting on the bus. Then other cars started to honk as well. One lady then backed up to look my direction and gave the hand up signal to say, ""hold on, I heard you,"" but still continued to converse. I did honk again because at this point, in my mind, this is a conversation to have when you are not blocking a road. The bus then left and we could all resume going. HOWEVER, the lady decided that she would walk my direction getting upset that I had the audacity to honk at them. What transpired was just a roll by of yelling and each person giving the finger to one another.

48,1f9ot0n,AITA for not doing yoga with my girlfriend?,"My girlfriend [18F] has been getting really upset with me recently for not doing things that she says would make her happy and that she thinks I would enjoy, because I think that I'd be uncomfortable doing these things.

It all started when she wanted to put makeup on my face (in a feminine way - blush lipstick etc) which I didn't feel very comfortable doing, but to compromise I let her partially do it, on the condition that she not take any photos. She got quite upset that I wouldn't let her take any photos, which I thought was a reasonable thing to ask as those photos would be quite embarassing for me. Her reasoning for wanting the photos was for the memories, but I don't understand why the memory itself wasn't enough.

More recently she wanted me to learn to do a tiktok dance with her, which I knew that I wouldn't enjoy, but offered to start learning with her anyway on the condition that she neither records/uploads it anywhere nor makes me do it Infront of anyone else. (Again this is because I find it quite embarassing for me). After about 5 minutes of learning the dance, she tells her sister that we are learning it and says that we will show her, which annoyed me as I had quite directly requested her not to make me do it Infront of anyone. She then got upset at me and said it was unreasonable of me to put my fear of being embarassed over her happiness. 

The most recent incident was today, she was talking about a yoga class that she wanted to do with me, and I told her that I don't really like yoga (as I've tried it in the past) and that I'd be willing to do a class with her but not a yoga one. I did slip up and mention that I would be embarrassed if my friends saw me doing a ladies yoga class, but I know I wouldn't enjoy it. She got very upset at me and started arguing with me, within earshot of her family which was more embarrassing for me. She loudly said she's mad that I keep putting my own embarassment over her happiness, but I don't understand why me not wanting to do something that I wouldn't enjoy is so unreasonable. AITA?

BACKGROUND: 

My aunt and her family (my older cousins and their kids) live in the same area as my family. Personally, I have never really felt close to them because every time they planned a family outing or did something together, my family was either not invited or told at the last minute. That would be fine if I didn‚Äôt get questions from my cousins asking why we weren‚Äôt there as if we were supposed to be there in the first place. At first I thought maybe they forgot to ask us but as I got older, I started to notice the pattern and got tired of it. I never made a scene about it or anything but I made a mental note to only show up to major events in the future (graduations, weddings, things of that nature).

A few months ago, my aunt told me that one of my younger cousins is graduating from high school, told me when it would be, and what they would be doing afterwards. I said I would like to be there and I made sure I could be there. When I got there, one of my other cousins asked if my dad and brother were coming too. Around this time, my dad and brother moved in with my aunt (I have my own apartment) so I figured maybe my aunt told them about it. I texted my brother and asked if they were coming and he said no because they didn‚Äôt know about it. Somehow, my aunt managed to not tell them about it even though they live in the same house.

Since things like this have happened since I was a child, this upset me but I didn‚Äôt say anything to my aunt because I wanted to focus on my cousin‚Äôs special day.

CURRENT SITUATION:

One of my older cousins got a new house recently and everyone is very happy for her. My aunt texted me this morning, saying that the family was going to have dinner at her house this weekend and I could come if I didn‚Äôt have any plans. 

I think it would be nice to go but I started thinking about what happened last time and wondered if my dad and brother were invited. I haven‚Äôt asked my aunt about that yet because I feel like it would start some drama but on the other hand I don‚Äôt want to not ask then show up and they aren‚Äôt there.

50,1f9odjr,AITA For Taking My Daughter's side? ,"I(45M) am in a relationship with 'Anne'. We've been in a relationship for 4 years. And to say the least, the last two years haven't been great. Anne and I officially broke up a week ago, we're just waiting for the lease to end. 

Last year May, my son (16M,Dee) came to live with us by choice. And my daughter (15F,claire) came to live with me in October, not by choice. 

Anne and Claire have not been able to click. Anne has consistently antagonised and targeted Claire. Last year before Claire lived with me, she visited, only for Anne to continuously argue with claire and I over the fact that she doesn't wear a bra. I've never seen the issue. Anne and I had temporarily broken up during Oct and she moved back in during February‚Äîthe issues only continued. 

There were complaints about claire CONSTANTLY. 

Then Anne started complaining because Claire was the only person in the house that didn't cook. And I also didn't see a problem with it since Dee and I didn't mind doing it. And Claire helped around the kitchen everytime someone cooked. Whereas Anne would cook once maybe every 2 weeks. 

However, today another issue came up, Claire made lunch. They were ""snackwiches"" and our machine only fits 4 at a time. Anne and Claire were both eating 2 each. Dee and I were eating 3 each. So Claire thought the obvious thing to do would be to make hers and Anne's first. So, she brought the plate to Anne and got a quick ""thank you"", no complaints. I jokingly told Claire I'd steal her food. Claire said that she was going to, but Dee put his in first, no big deal. 

Anne, for some reason, loses it on claire and starts going on about ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù, she's condescending as she explains that as the breadwinner, I should be served first. Then the woman of the house. She stumbled and quickly said that it wasn't her, it was claire(??). Then the rest. And I simply chimed in, saying that growing up we let the children get served first, then the women, then the men. Very politely, Claire just said ‚ÄúJust depends on how you were raised, no biggie‚Äù. That's when Anne raises her voice. And Claire very calmly told her ‚Äúit's really just not that serious‚Äù. Anne moved on. 

But after dee and Claire left the room, Anne started zoning in on me for it. And I took Claires side because it doesn't matter who's served first. As long as everyone gets to eat. Now Anne won't get off my case about it, because ‚Äúit's just etiquette and about respect‚Äù and ‚Äúdon't educate your children then, fine‚Äù.

51,1f9ocsr,AITA for refusing to name my baby after a dead girl?,"

I (25F) and my husband(27M) have a complicated history together, especially concerning his family. I met him on a blind date when we were both in college, and he asked me to be his girlfriend on our second date. he's always been sweet, trying to be considerate of my feelings especially when it comes to his family. his mother has always been against our relationship from the start, mostly due to the reasons I think I might be the asshole here.

he had a friend, let's call her Annie who passed away when he was a teenager. he's always been close with her, and he always insisted they were platonic. however his mother always talked about how they were suppose to get married as adults and I was his ""second choice"" and he wouldn't have married me if she was alive. it's always hurt in all honesty, and I've tried as hard as I can to be accommodating for her and her grief as she cared about Annie a lot and was even friends with her mother. Annie was a great girl, and I do wish I could have gotten to know her but it hurts being constantly compared to the woman my husband could have been with, especially since we already have a son who his mother isn't allowed to see because of her insistace that he's not her ""real grandbaby"" because he isn't Annie's 

so this is where I think i probably overreacted and could be the asshole, we found out two months ago that we were having a baby girl and we were ecstatic! I was worried he'd be one of those boy only fathers, but he almost cried finding out we'd have a girl. our son is also over the moon, constantly talking to his sister and asking for her name...which has become an issue as he recently asked to name our daughter after Annie, which was upsetting especially since his mother is so hung up about them being together. we ended up arguing slightly and I'm currently staying with my son at a friend's house.

am I overthinking this? I just don't know what to do, his mom has been blowing up my messages (I don't even know how she got my messenger, me and him havent spoken to her since our sons first birthday) and my mama has just told me to stop arguing over it and just let him choose her name since she's his only daughter, any advice is appreciated I need a nonbias opinion. my friend says that I was overreacting for leaving but I just needed time for myself, and I don't want to confront him right now. I know I can be sensitive without realizing so many input is appreciated

54,1f9o4cg,AITA for dialing back and not caring,"Gonna try and keep this short and sweet, I'm still figuring out reddit and got auto modded the last time I posted.

As condense a version as possible I've worked for my company for 8 years now, and the basic breakdown that is relevant to the story is I am basically a call out shift lead (if no shift leads are there I can do the role for the day), there is New Guy who got shift lead promotion, Little Boss, and Big Boss.
(Little boss doesn't have many friends, new guy is little bosses best friend, and big boss is little bosses older brother. It'll all make sense soon I promise)

I've been working for little boss and big boss for 2 years now, I've established myself as one extremely hard worker. Big Bosses exact words were ""if it wasn't for you getting as much work done as you did while you were partnered up with little boss while he was a shift lead I would never have been able to promote him to little boss""

Last December little boss had some issues and convinced big boss to get new guy transferred to us. The thing is that's when I was supposed to get the promotion to permanent shift lead. Little boss said new guy would only come over for permanent shift lead promotion, and I got screwed out of the promotion.

Last week New guy, little boss, and big boss want to have a conversation with me. The basics of it was big boss told new guy that our area isn't covering as much work as we normally do. The had several conversations about it and eventually new guy got demoted to call out shift lead. New guy blames me because and I quote ""you used to cover all of this work by yourself when little boss was shift lead, it's not fair that you won't work that hard for me!!! I shouldn't have to tell you we need to cover more you should just do it because you helped little boss get his promotion you should do that for me! You two used to sit around because you got done everything early it's only fair I get the same treatment, you don't even care that I got demoted! It's not my fault I got the promotion because of who I knew!""

I told all three of them ""I did not intentionally get him demoted, I stopped doing so much extra and working hard because you all said that even though I'm better then new guy and deserve the promotion new guy gets it because he is best friends with little boss and big boss wanted to make little boss happy by bring new guy over and meeting his demands. This is basically nepotism by proxy so no, I'm not doing extra I'm going to do the bare minimum my job requires. It's clear hard work gets me nowhere so why should I do it? Also no I don't care that he got demoted because had he done his fair share of work we would gave covered the same distance, his demotion is a him problem not a me problem""

Some of my buddies think even though I'm justified in how I feel I'm an asshole for not letting it go and not working as hard as before and that I refuse to work harder to get new guy his promotion back.

I've wanted to respect him and be as helpful as possible but it has come to my attention that he doesn't appreciate it and is just angry and think I'm being manipulative blah blah. 
This has been going on for 2 months and I feel emotionally ripped off. 
Anyways, the apartment will hopefully be sold soon and since I've put much effort to help and be accommodating (paying more than I need to, doing the cleaning, packing etc) without any recognition I don't want to have done it all for nothing.

I've also realized that looking at the apartment I've spent so so so many hours improving it. 
Painting some of the walls on my own, I've gotten all the decor, I've printed all the prints, buying the frames, framed them and hung them up on the walls, I've taken care of all the plants, installed dimmable light switches etc.
Ive made our apartment a home. Yes he has helped, but nothing would have been done without me telling him.
This will probably aid to the sales price.

So I asked him if I could get sometjing for the extra work I've put in to the sale and improvement of the apartment. 

He immediately said no. 
I asked him to reconsider and think about how much I've actually done.

He says I'm trying to cheat him off money I have no right to. 
I reminded him that I'm paying 70% of the rent instead of 50% so I am ssvibg him money every month. 

He told his parents and they all say that I'm in the wrong and I have no right complaining since the apartment could have been rented out for a big profit if I didn't live there (but I do because I have nowhere to go).

57,1f9nc0y,WIBTA for leaving my high-school chat group?,"For a little background,

I used to have my HS group of friends. We'd meet on weekend and just go out and stuff, but lately they've been doing drugs, smoking weed and sometimes design drugs like lsd or mdma and I'm not into that so I kinda stopped going to the meetings. That, and just our interests in general aren't the same anymore.

Thing is I'm still on the group chat and, in that group there is a guy who's my best friend (let's call him ""A"") for the longest time. I've known the hs guys for like 7 years but my bf I've known for like 22 years (I'm 23).

So after I came back for a year long trip this guy ""A""  just didn't speak to me anymore nor invited me to the meetings. He just did it once in a very weird way and after I was the one mentioning I arrived home. He was pretty much oblivious to the fact that I was back in my home country and wanted him to talk to me.

Basically this ended up distancing us and now he won't even talk to me anymore, even though I proposed to him meeting a couple times. Heck, even his parents stopped speaking to mine, even though they were also friends.

Now I'm just in the group chat seeing their messages but not going to any meeting or answering anything. I don't think I would go even if I were invited, but honestly I do not have any problem with any member of the group. I respect them all and understand that they took different paths.

That is, except for ""A"". I hate him for what he did to me (there is a longer story behind this, just do not want to write a huge wall of text, it is kind of explained in another post of mine).

So, I was thinking of just exiting the chat group but sending a message before leaving explaining how I do not have a problem with any of them, except for ""A"" and mention how he left me aside (because, knowing him, he might have told a different story).

Liam is one of my best friends, while Emily is a good friend, but our friendship is more casual. Last year, Liam and Emily slept together twice.

Liam rarely spoke about it, but Emily constantly vented to me and other friends. She repeatedly asked me to talk to Liam, which I did, but there was little I could do. Emily didn‚Äôt appreciate my efforts and felt I wasn‚Äôt doing enough, which was frustrating since I was trying to remain neutral and not ruin my friendship with Liam.

The situation dragged on for over six months. Emily went to great lengths to badmouth Liam, including spreading false rumours, and it strained my friendship with others in our group. It was affecting my mental health, and I felt like I was being forced to pick a side.

I personally find this situation small, but I regularly find myself being ordered to do things her way and immediately because she claims she cant trust me to do it when she wants it(she is not entirely wrong, but it also isn't that frequent and is only ever small things that don't really matter like washing up cups, or turning off a light

Story as follows:  
We arrive home parking in the driveway, I get out the car with her bag and walk to the house entrance, as I get to the back door she says please close the gate.

I agree and say ""sure"" as I walk in the house. My intention is to walk past her room, drop her bag on her bed, then walk out the front door to close the gate which is in line with the front door, then back in to her room. As i am walking to do this she gets very insistent that i close the gate, and i repeatedly reply sure I will.

Story as follows:  
We arrive home parking in the driveway, I get out the car with her bag and walk to the house entrance, as I get to the back door she says please close the gate.

I agree and say ""sure"" as I walk in the house. My intention is to walk past her room, drop her bag on her bed, then walk out the front door to close the gate which is in line with the front door, then back in to her room. As i am walking to do this she gets very insistent that i close the gate, and i repeatedly reply sure I will.

62,1f9lirc,AITA for telling my ILs to stop getting me gifts and for throwing away past gifts from them?,"For the last 5ish years, for my birthday and Christmas every year, my wife's parents get me a DNA kit so I can find out who my biological father is. That's the gift they get me each time. I have told them I'm not going to find out and I have tried returning gifts or giving it away to someone else/throwing it in the trash. But they still buy me the same thing twice a year. My wife has told them they're wasting their own money and need to stop but they still buy me this. And the reason? Because one time I expressed that I would like to know for sure who my father is.

The reason I don't take the gift and find out? Because I have three potential fathers, a guy my mom dated, his brother (who was engaged at the time) and his father (who was married to his mother). My mom has been honest with me about it and she thinks it's more likely to be the once engaged brother or the father who is my biological father. But she doesn't know. She never told them about me because she realized the truth would cause so much trouble.

I don't want to drop a bomb on these people and risk being hated for it. If they're angry enough they might refuse to give me any info. And I know they could handle it better. But I'm not willing to take the risk. It's not worth it to me.

My ILs disagree but instead of continuing to tell me I need to find out, they do this. It's annoying honestly and I feel like we're stuck in this back and forth. So I decided a few days ago to tell them outright to stop buying me gifts. I said I won't use the DNA kits they keep getting me and throwing them away is getting tiring. They told me if I wasn't so rude and actually kept and used their gift, it wouldn't be such a big deal. They said they are trying to help me and I'm unappreciative. My wife has my back.

I never knew my dad or really cared that I didn't know him. I was really close with my mom and didn't want or need anything else. Our relationship was good but I always sorta felt like she saw spending time with me as an obligation and that she didn't want to do it as much as me.

When I was 12 she told me she had a boyfriend and that she wanted him to move in with us alongside his daughter. Then she went on to talk about all the zoom calls she'd had with her and that she'd spent some time with her, how she was a really great kid, the best, how she could be my little sister and how my mom already saw her as another daughter.

When I met my mom's husband he asked a ton of questions about me because mom told him very little (which he said directly). Yet my mom had listed off a bunch of shit about his daughter Cam (now 13). My mom spent all of moving in day being all about Cam and left me with her husband. He didn't say much. He just asked me for help once and then I went to my room. Mom took Cam out for a special dinner while her husband and I got other stuff. I got a frozen pizza and he made sandwiches. 

After they moved in mom spent a lot of time with Cam. She still spent time with me. But she seemed so excited to spend time with Cam and I never saw her show that same excitement for me. I asked my mom why she was so much more excited about being with Cam and she told me that was the green eyed monster talking and she wasn't more excited to spend time with Cam.

My partner and I were in the car driving home from the store, and we were on a long stretch of road with no other cars aside from us. Like twice in the last 10 years of our relationship, he thought it would be funny to violently swerve the wheel back and forth (again, no other cars or people on the road). 

This last time was 2 days ago, and he decided to swerve the car as ‚Äúa joke‚Äù, a joke he knows I absolutely hate and do not find funny. There was no warning, we weren‚Äôt arguing prior, we were just silently driving. He suddenly jerked the wheel back and forth on an empty road, and I hit the side of my head on the thing that hold the seat belt. I wasn‚Äôt bleeding, but I was absolutely pissed. 

I yelled at him for being an irresponsible driver and for making me hit my head. He then got all defensive about it, saying it was just a joke and that I was overreacting.

My husband said it wasn‚Äôt a nice thing to say and that I shouldn‚Äôt assume what she would do. I explained that it was just a joke, but he insisted I wasn‚Äôt being kind. He left the room upset.

Later, he came back to tell me to hurry for breakfast. I explained that I wasn‚Äôt trying to insult his sister and that I did say the same about myself.

72,1f9jryu,AITA for refusing to attend a neighborhood party at my house?,"I (17m) still live with my dad. He and his wife moved to a new neighborhood recently and they decided they wanna throw a party to get to know the neighbors. I don't want to be because I know questions will come up about my ""family"" and the last time I was put in that position, a couple of years ago, I was so pissed about them forcing me to attend a party with them that I brought up the fact my dad's wife hated my mom for years, longer than my parents knew each other and longer than she knew my dad, and how dad and her had an affair while my mom was dying from breast cancer. 

I was 9 when my mom died and I found out about dad and his wife because he brought her into the house when mom was near the end of her life and the two of them were fucking grossly together. My mom would never have given her blessing for that. She hated that woman just as much as that woman hated her. I have never forgiven my dad or looked at him in a positive light since. When mom died I tried so hard to get put in foster care rather than live with them, but it didn't work.

We ended up moving away a few weeks after mom died because the judgement they faced back home.

She tried to play the role of super ""mom"" to me. Trying to be SO involved in my life. But I never accepted her or given her a chance. They talked about adoption but quickly scrapped that idea because they were told I would be spoken to since I was 10 before they got married. They have two kids together now and that didn't soften me to them. I don't blame the kids. But am I close to them? Nah. I make it a point to keep my distance because I won't stick around and I won't want a relationship with them and to keep my dad and his wife in my life as an adult, even if only occasionally for my half siblings. A relationship with my half siblings is not important enough to have any contact with those two.

After the incident of me telling people about the affair, I was grounded for so long, we had all kinds of therapy and I stuck to my word about hating them and finding them both disgusting. But my life was also miserable because I was grounded, had everything taken from me for weeks. I was offered a shorter sentence if I told her I loved her but I wasn't going to lie, couldn't say the words. So it was almost 9 weeks of hell. And they ended up being judged by some more people.

So this time I'm refusing to attend and my dad is furious. He told me questions will be asked. I said if I'm there questions will get answered and I won't hold back on how I feel about them or what they did. He told me to let it go after 8 years and I told him that'll never happen. I told him I don't want to pretend we're a family when the truth is I'm ashamed to be his son. He told me he still can't let those questions about why I'm not there get answered and I'll upset my half siblings by making this another fight. I told him I'll work and he can say that but he was still saying not good enough.

73,1f9jqzy,AITA for reprimanding a teen for the comments he was making about Deaf people?,"I (f28) work in a small shop and restaurant in an apartment complex. I deal a lot with the customers directly because I often assist with ringing up customers and taking orders even though I'm the manager. There are a handful of teens that are disrespectful to myself or my staff, but for the most part the kids and teens are very polite and well behaved.

The teen in question (m, approx 14-15) has been reprimanded in my shop before for going against one of our policies and using his bare hands to help himself to our loose sweets (we have an established system where one of our shop assistants helps the kids/teens with the sweets using gloves. We have helped him personally this way before several times so he should know better). When I aske him if he forget covid existed and that it's unhygienic, he apologised and we moved on. He did not seem like a disrespectful kid, just impatient and possibly didn't really think before he acted. That was about two weeks ago, but today there was a new incident that occurred outside of the store.

The complex has an open smoking area that's about 10-15 meters from the store that gets a lot of sunshine, so I opt to smoke there rather than behind the restaurant kitchen (it's still chilly in the mornings here). The aforementioned teen and a friend of his was sitting in the smoking area (not smoking, just chatting) and I sat across from them, greeted them, and started scrolling on reddit. The teen was going on some tangent about people at school, when he seemingly randomly switched to talking about Deaf people. As a person within the community (Hard of Hearing, may possibly lose what's left of my hearing within the next 10 years), I was quite taken aback by some of the stuff he was saying. He was basically making fun of how some Deaf people make sounds or try to speak when they're signing, and how they're ""stupid"" for doing so because they don't know how words sound. He also made some other comments along the lines of how stupid/funny Deaf people are in the way they act, and then started making fun of them by fake signing and making the ""noises"" that some Deaf people make whilst communicating. This is where I might be the asshole.

I looked up at him and his friend and very bluntly said ""That's incredibly disrespectful. I'm part of the Deaf community, and you should never make fun of anyone's disability"". The teen and his friend stammered a little bit, got up, and left the smoking area.

I don't regret standing up for my community. I don't stand for prejudice at all ever, and have kicked people out of my shop for being racist, homophobic, etc in the past. However, this was a teenager and I'm not his parent nor his teacher, and I'm worried it may not be my place to reprimand him. I didn't shout and I wasn't aggressive, but I was blunt and to the point.

hloe in a vent and Lana was around she would (Lana would) treat it like some romantic story. That it was ‚Äúsweet‚Äù.

Like, every single time I agree to babysit my niece (3F), she‚Äôll say she‚Äôll be back by a certain time, but then she shows up an hour or more late with no real explanation.

I get it things come up, especially when you're a parent. But this has been happening every time for months now. Last week was the final straw. She asked if I could babysit for just 3 hours so she could run errands. I agreed, and she was supposed to be back by 5 PM. I had evening plans with friends and made it clear I needed to leave by 6 at the latest. Of course, 5 PM came and went with no sign of her. I called and texted, and she just replied, Be there soon!

She didn‚Äôt show up until 7 PM. I was beyond frustrated because I had to cancel my plans. When she finally arrived, I told her that I wasn‚Äôt going to babysit anymore if she couldn‚Äôt respect my time. She got defensive, saying I should be more understanding because she‚Äôs a single mom and it‚Äôs tough to manage everything on her own. I do feel bad, but at the same time, I feel like she‚Äôs taking advantage of me.

Now my parents are involved and think I should cut her some slack because family helps family. But I‚Äôm just tired of being taken for granted.",0.0,-0.015375415794551373,0,1
78,1f9hy7l,AITA for not reaching out to friends properly while injured,"Hi! This is my first Reddit post, and I hope it helps me figure out what's been going on.

I (23F) recently had an accident abroad and ended up with a broken foot and a sprained ankle. Two friends (both 23M) were on the trip with me. Once I got home, the pain was awful, and I had to quit my jobs early, leaving me financially stressed. I‚Äôm moving to Spain soon, and this injury was just another stressor. The hospital gave me crutches and a boot, which was a relief because I didn‚Äôt need surgery or a cast, but I still felt scared and immobilized. I had to rely on my boyfriend, mom, and stepdad, and I barely saw anyone else, which gave me major cabin fever.

I‚Äôm in a group chat with five friends: Jack, Luke, Rachel (25F), and Mark (24M). I updated them about my injury, but only Luke stayed in touch outside the chat. The others, especially Jack and Mark, didn‚Äôt check in on me or ask about my recovery. This played into my anxiety, and I started feeling really isolated, especially since I wasn‚Äôt in a good place mentally due to the injury and my upcoming move.

As time passed, I noticed they started organizing meetups and a D&D game without me. I was hurt when I found out they‚Äôd discussed it behind my back, assuming I wasn‚Äôt interested because I didn‚Äôt engage much in the chat. I felt excluded, especially when I ran into them all at a market without any heads-up that they were meeting.

I decided to tell them how I felt‚Äîhurt, left out, and lonely. Jack responded by saying it wasn‚Äôt their fault I felt this way since they‚Äôd invited me to things, but I hadn‚Äôt gone. While I understood his point, I still thought they should‚Äôve checked in about my injury.

I had a good talk with Luke, who apologized and admitted they could‚Äôve done more to include me. Rachel also apologized for not reaching out more. Both acknowledged the miscommunication, and I appreciated that. However, it was frustrating to learn that Jack and Mark had actively decided not to check in with me about D&D or other plans, thinking I wasn‚Äôt interested.

When I tried explaining my feelings to the group, owning up to my part and acknowledging that I should have communicated more, Jack and Mark responded by accusing me of being aggressive and rude. They twisted everything I said and blamed me for not opting into plans. They claimed I was being sarcastic, and threw back at me that I‚Äôd been to concerts and events, even though they knew those experiences weren‚Äôt great due to my injury. Their replies made me feel awful, like they had no empathy for my situation.

I left the group chat after that because I didn‚Äôt know how to respond anymore. Luke and Rachel were supportive, but I feel hurt and confused by Jack and Mark‚Äôs reactions.

Should I reach out to them again, or should I just let it go? Am I the one in the wrong here?

79,1f9hlrt,AITA For Having Unrealistic Expectations from my Friend,"At the end of August, my best friend came to visit from Out East and we'd planned a camping trip. We started planning this in May, so it was no surprise at all. Everyone had over a month heads up for days to take off work and I was heavily communicating.

One of our friends, who was already invited on the trip, we'll call him Kyle, moved to the island during the planning process. It worked out really well because our friend Shaun already lived on the Island. And so they could take the ferry to the mainland together. Kyle said he'd come over Wednesday after work with Shaun and sleep at mine, so we can all leave together.

Kyle was supposed to pick up my best friend's camping stuff from her parents', who live on the island. He's there every day for work. And he can pick up Shaun. Afterwards, Kyle tried to claim he didn't say he'd do this, but he DEFINITELY DID to the point that Shaun had to completely redo all his plans.

He completely ghosted everyone. And so I had to scramble to compensate for everything Kyle was supposed to bring (including sending my best friend camping with literal house bedding as opposed to a sleeping bag) plus getting Shaun on a ferry and ready.

It was so, so much to put on me, and I'm kinda a little bit furious. And my best friend visited Kyle the other day before she left town and she said Fucking Nothing. And he Fucked Her Over. And she said nothing. And she told me we shouldn't talk about the trip because he's going through a rough time. But honestly. What about me?

I want to have a TALK with him about how he let people down. 

This is how I'm rethinking it: 

He did actually try to reach our campsite, although he didn't look up the best route. He literally tried to drive directly up a fucking 2,000m waterfall in a two-wheel drive. I think he's a really sweet guy. Before we went out of cell service, we knew he was driving up. He might just be an idiot. 

But he had no excuse for saying he'd give Shaun a lift to my place and... idk. I don't think this is a 'good person vs. bad person' situation, but I don't know how to approach this. And I thought my best friend would back me up. But no.

80,1f9hkto,AITA for calling stepson the second coming of the messiah.,"I (45M) live with my fiancee (43F) our 2 daughters and stepson (12M). Ever since her son has reached puberty he has become difficult to manage. His attitude is appalling and he talks to people like shit. He has no respect for others. My partner treats him like he's a celebrity. He was excused from school for a day because he told a teacher to go fuck themselves. He is spoiled rotten by his grandparents. He has 2 electric bikes, a motorbike he was given for christmas, PS5, mobile phones, pads, money into an account which he uses at will. You name it, he has it. He's allowed out whenever and a late curfew. No real bedtime to speak off and when he does, he'll be on his phone until all hours. My partner works part-time and I'm full time. I try and pick up a bit of overtime here and there but it's difficult. I probably pay 60% of household bills. He goes to soccer practice and is driven and picked up. Gets virtually everything he wants. However, the way he talks to people angers me. I'm from the UK and he's what you would call a ""chav"". However my partner thinks he's wonderful. He does absolutely nothing to help around the house. A few years ago I asked my partner (which she agreed to) that he would do the dishwasher and recycling. To date, he's maybe done the dishwasher once, and the recycling a handful of times (these are daily chores). We had a massive blow out a few weeks ago, because I repeatedly asked him to clean up after himself and friends. He did a half assed job and I told him to do it again, which he still left loads of crap lying around, so I said ""That's it, you're not going back out with your friends"". It resulted in him telling me to fuck off and to die and he's going out, he pushed past me. I had to restrain him and basically threw him upstairs to stop him from leaving. After my partner came home we chatted and sorted it out, with an agreement he'd be better and that he'd start doing those chores we agreed to years prior. He did none of that. Again this morning he's telling my daughter (7F) to stop licking the chocolate spread off her toast it's disgusting. I told him to ignore her and not look at her. He told me in a rude way ""I wasn't talking to you"". I took his plate of toast away and told him to leave. This resulted in him telling me to fuck off and that I'm a faggot and he wishes I was dead. My partner came out of the toilet and started yelling at me. It resulted in a horrendous argument. She's given me back the engagement ring and said we're done. I've argued that she treats him like he's the second coming of the messiah and she worships the ground he walks on. There's no discipline, no rules, no boundaries, no enforcement of chores, so when I enforce them (or try to) I'm a faggot and told to fuck off etc etc. Now admittedly I used some choice words after he told me to fuck off, but I won't be spoken to like that by anyone, let alone a 12 year old child yet my partner cannot see what he's becoming.

It was a great day overall, but there were a few issues that have caused tension between us.

During the event, the photographer asked us to pose together for some pictures. I'm not particularly fond of posing for photos, but I went along with it to make sure our special day was captured. When I noticed my fianc√©e wasn‚Äôt looking comfortable during the photo session, I asked her if she was okay with having her picture taken. She said she wasn‚Äôt comfortable, so I asked the photographer to stop taking any more pictures of us and we moved on.

This whole photo session issue lasted less than 5 minutes, and we continued with the event. We then went to dinner, which took a bit longer than planned (approximately 15 minutes) due to the number of guests. Nothing else out of the ordinary happened, and we went home and went to bed since we were both exhausted.

The next day, she started complaining about how I didn‚Äôt ask for her consent properly during the photo session, despite my asking her directly. She also blamed me for the dinner being late, even though the delay was minor and she had agreed to plan the dinner for the guests.

Now, four days after the engagement, she‚Äôs still upset and on the verge of breaking up with me over these issues. I feel like I did everything I could to address her concerns and ensure she was comfortable.

We are going on holiday around the new year in January and have bought a one way ticket to our destination. We are meeting up with friends on this trip and have not ironed out the exact details of when we will be returning but know it will be after the new year. We have discussed extending the trip by a few days into the weekend instead of returning immediately after Jan 1. 
Phil didn‚Äôt realize he is on call the weekend we want to return; he asked a friend to exchange call weekend but the friend politely declined. 

Phil expressed that he was disappointed in said friend for not being able to switch call schedules. 

Here‚Äôs where I unintentionally start invalidating his feelings by saying he shouldn‚Äôt feel disappointed in his friend. The friend is going to be a new dad in December so maybe he really can‚Äôt help you out. I‚Äôm sure the friend feels sorry he cannot help but Phil  should feel disappointed at the situation, not the friend. 

I asked him why he was disappointed in his friend. His reply was if it were him, he‚Äôd switch call weekend so his friend could enjoy a few extra days of holiday internationally. I feel like he‚Äôs disappointed because he expected his friend to say yes. But if the friend says no, respect their boundaries, not feel disappointed that they can‚Äôt resolve our problem. 
 
We then argue about how he isn‚Äôt entitled to other people‚Äôs help but he retorts with having high expectations in himself therefore others and friends. 

So AITA for invalidating his feelings of disappointment? 


This has been a recurring point of tension between us throughout the years where I feel like he feels entitled to other people‚Äôs help. Phil is a generous guy, and if it weren‚Äôt for his generosity, I would not have fallen in love with him. But this mindset is something I disagree with.

For context me and my mom get a long but to a degree, for example if I‚Äôm upset about something she did or said she doesn‚Äôt validate how I feel. She doesn‚Äôt listen to me or try to understand me or where I‚Äôm coming from, if we‚Äôre having a disagreement on the phone she will just straight up hang up on me and not talk to me. Or if we‚Äôre talking in person she‚Äôll just constantly cut me off and when I get upset she makes it seem like I‚Äôm causing a problem for no reason. I‚Äôve tried multiple times to communicate with her in a productive way but she always gets me to a point that I‚Äôm either yelling at her or cutting her off. 

Our relationship has been this way for a while now and I don‚Äôt remember how it got this way
I‚Äôm 24(f) my mom is 43(f).  

Overall tho we manage to have a decent relationship.  So the main point of the post is I have a business plan to open a school and my mom knows some people that can help me financially fund it, and not like little funding I‚Äôm talking about multimillion dollar funding. 

I‚Äôve told my mom about my business ideas before but this is the first time she‚Äôs actually taken me seriously and wanted to help. Note that SHE wanted to help I never asked, I met the person(s) that are interested in funding my school and we planned for a presentation of my school idea this month. 

Today, my mom tells me she kinda got into a dispute with a woman who works closely for the main person I need to fund my school. When she mentioned it to me I told her I can‚Äôt be associated with that, I didn‚Äôt want the person funding me to see me as an extension of her and see me as my own person professionally. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want her involved or not at meetings, I just wanted to give myself the opportunity to show who I am as a person and not my mom‚Äôs daughter. 

I tried explaining that to her and instead of listening to me or trying to understand me, she told me that I was being ‚Äúfake‚Äù and I‚Äôm trying to ice her out. And that if I want to have funding for my school I could go to anyone else without her contacts (meaning the person that will fund my school) since I don‚Äôt want her involved. 

But the only reason I don‚Äôt want her involvement is because we don‚Äôt communicate well and I want to do this on my own. She didn‚Äôt care about my idea until recently when I‚Äôve been thinking about this school for years. Long story short I ended up blocking her, am I wrong if I have the meeting without her?

Note that SHE wanted to help I never asked, I met the person(s) that are interested in funding my school and we planned for a presentation of my school idea this month. 

Today, my mom tells me she kinda got into a dispute with a woman who works closely for the main person I need to fund my school. When she mentioned it to me I told her I can‚Äôt be associated with that, I didn‚Äôt want the person funding me to see me as an extension of her and see me as my own person professionally. That doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt want her involved or not at meetings, I just wanted to give myself the opportunity to show who I am as a person and not my mom‚Äôs daughter. 

I tried explaining that to her and instead of listening to me or trying to understand me, she told me that I was being ‚Äúfake‚Äù and I‚Äôm trying to ice her out. And that if I want to have funding for my school I could go to anyone else without her contacts (meaning the person that will fund my school) since I don‚Äôt want her involved. 

But the only reason I don‚Äôt want her involvement is because we don‚Äôt communicate well and I want to do this on my own. She didn‚Äôt care about my idea until recently when I‚Äôve been thinking about this school for years. Long story short I ended up blocking her, am I wrong if I have the meeting without her?

85,1f9gwpf,AITA for Reporting on My Classmate to the Advisor? ,"This story was from the 6th grade/year. I was classmates/acquaintances with a girl named Georgia (not her real name), I knew since kindergarten but we were never really close, She was know as the popular girl and ""one of the boys"".

One day before class started Georgia went up to me and my friends, she pulled her sleeve up and show us cuts on her wrist and even show us the razor blade she was using. We asked Georgia why would she do this, but Georgia just told us about her friend in the 5th grade that was also doing this because they were depressed, which of course concerned me and my friends. We tried to get more info from her but she didn't say much and even gave me razor blade for god knows what. 

Deep down I think she was doing it for attention. She had a history of doing things for attention but I would have never thought she would go that far for attention. 

For days I thought it through if I should say something to our class advisor, I knew she would get angry at me if she found I told on her, but I was also concerned for her. At the end, I ended up tell the class advisor about Georgia. After that Georgia stopped cutting herself well she wasn't showing us and she stopped wearing hoodies so I assumed she had stopped.

But I can't help but think she knows I did it, ng Georgia started being a lot more distant from me, and being more ""blunt"" to me.

86,1f9gl0t,"AITA for refusing to wake my boyfriend up in the morning, which made him almost lose his job?","So I (25f) have been with my boyfriend (25m) for almost a year, and during our entire relationship he has struggled with waking up in the morning because of his adhd. He sleeps through all of his alarms, which usually means he is late for work. Sometimes it¬¥s only 10-15 minutes, but it can also stretch to 1 hour. His boss likes him and has given him plenty of chances, but yesterday he got his last warning that if he doesn¬¥t show up on time he will lose his job.

We have had a couple of discussions/arguments about this over the last year because he believes it¬¥s my responsibility, as his girlfriend, to wake him up. But I don¬¥t. Despite me waking up from his alarms and being able to shove him out of bed (if need be), I don¬¥t think it¬¥s my responsibility. He is an adult, has known about his adhd since he was a child, and should by now have found some method that works. Him making it my responsibility turns me into a caregiver, a mother, instead of a girlfriend.

This doesn¬¥t mean I refuse to help him whatsoever. I have done plenty of research to find alternative methods, but either it didn¬¥t work or he refuses to do it. And I do wake him when his alarms go off, but he decides to go back to sleep right after. Had he not done that, I would gladly wake him up every single day. And I know this is only my perspective, and is most likely not true from his, but when he decides to just go back to sleep it makes it seem like he doesn¬¥t want to try. Not to mention the fact that he is especially grumpy/angry in the mornings and have, on several occasions, yelled at me for both waking him up and for not waking him up. And I don¬¥t want to help if he is just going to get mad (even though I know he doesn¬¥t mean it).

But when his boss gave him his last warning yesterday, I felt so much guilt. Because had I just woken him up, and been persistent, he wouldn¬¥t be in this situation. So I am at an impasse. Is it my responsibility, am I in the wrong for not helping, or should he, as an adult, be able to do this by himself? Because I kinda feel like the AH, but also not.

EDIT: I feel like I should mention more to the reason I don¬¥t want to wake him up. It¬¥s not like I can¬¥t, since I¬¥m already awake, but first of all this affects my day too. I can¬¥t go to sleep before him, because our bedroom doesn¬¥t have a door (small apartment) so if he¬¥s watching tv or gaming it keeps me awake. This means I don¬¥t get enough sleep either, so when I have to do uni work during the day (before I have work in the evenings) I zone out and usually fall asleep (physically can¬¥t keep my eyes open). Which is why I wish I could keep sleeping for an hour or so longer, without having to worry if he got up or not. 

But I also don¬¥t want this responsibility because I love him. I want him to be independent, and I know we¬¥re in a relationship and we¬¥re supposed to depend on each other. And we do. But I don¬¥t want him to depend on me to get him to work on time, or to keep his economy in check or anything that would turn his life upside down should we break up. I need to know he can take care of himself in case something happens. 

EDIT 2: Not much of an update, but I talked to him yesterday and he has come to the realization himself that it's not my responsibility. He felt that way because he felt like a failure for not being able to do it, so like a lot of you said it was easier to blame me. We did agree to try the wake-up light so hopefully that will work. I am not breaking up with him. I love him and want to keep helping him. I made this post because I was unsure if I should've done more, or if the fact that he had taken no personal responsibility to make a change means I did all I could. He is well aware that he is the only one who can make a change. Neither I nor a psychologist can make that change for him. He hasn't until a couple years ago tried to genuinely take control so it makes sense that he's still finding methods that work. But I suggested both a psychologist and finding other people with the same diagnoses as him so he has someone to talk to. Hopefully we'll figure it out together. Of course I will be there for him, help him find methods, and be there if they fail. But making the effort to change is something he has to do himself. 
I apologize if it seemed like I was trying to make myself a victim as some of you pointed out. That was not my intention.

My husband was supposed to go with us but had to make a last-minute cancellation due to some reasons. Now, Sophie is in a this ""friends group"" ever since she was 2 (all of them still go to the same school). There 11 more children, we, their parents, used to take them out for playing in groups, on trips, etc. when they were younger. (To add more context: When we joined the group, our combined household income was barely 200k but now, it's 500k after all the promotions me and my husband have had so we could easily afford this trip after an year and half of not talking any trip longer than 2 days)

My daughter has always been interested in history and recently had been reading a book about film production related to Rome. I have also really loved Italian food and have been wanting to visit somewhere with lots of farms, etc. Since, it was supposed to be a family trip but my husband had to cancel last minute, I didn't have any time to ask the other parents if they were interested (we normally take trips together, even now, but just with the mothers and the daughters, no fathers, we call it the ""girls trip""). 

We just went ahead on the trip visiting small towns, taking both educational tours and having fun. During this time, the other people in the group had no idea about this. After we came back, my daughter gave her friends the souvenirs she had bought for them and then, I got calls from the other mothers asking why we went alone as the other would have liked to join in as well.

91,1f9fnah,AITA for not allowing my son to get a pet tarantula?,"Hi Reddit. Just wanted a 3rd opinion on my situation despite it not being something that is ruining my relationships or anything like that, because I do feel a little bad.

So my (39M) son (13M) has been looking into pet tarantulas recently. He has always been interested in exotic pets and is now wanting to keep a tarantula. He has had other pet bugs before, like roly polies and stick bugs, but I am given to understand that tarantulas can live for many years which is part of the reason why he's obessed with them.

The issue I have with this is that I am severely arachnophobic. Other bugs I'm not a fan of either but I can tolerate if he keeps them in his room. Meanwhile, just seeing a tiny spider in a room makes me paranoid and not want to stay there. Or even a picture will creep me out (jumping spiders are sometimes OK in pictures but still creepy in real life). I am aware that this is an irrational fear. Also before anybody asks, I never kill spiders, I let my wife (39F) or my sons put them outside.

I just don't think I would be comfortable in the house knowing that such a creature is living with me. For example, what if it escapes? My son has said that tarantulas never have to come out of their cage or be touched, but even if the chances are extremely low they are still there. But this phobia is my only reason for refusing him. He is a very responsible kid and he would 100% be able to take care of it, I am given to understand they only need to be watered and fed and he has demonstrated the ability to be responsible for a pet before. 

We discussed jumping spiders which are a bit more tolerable to me but those apparently have short lives like most bugs so he's not interested. I told him I was sorry but I would have to veto the idea of getting one. My wife and my younger son (11M) are on his side (his brother is more just supporting him/also thinks spiders are cool rather than being as invested as he is) but my wife suggested a policy of everybody in the household has to agree with a pet which I 100% agree with, it is not fair to the animal even if it's just a bug I think it's better to err on the side of caution and thinking of it as an animal. 

He said he wanted one because he ""wanted a friend who could be with him for a long time"", which resonated with me, I was introverted as a kid too and felt less lonely through my own weird hobbies, of course he deserves as much too. He's not heartbroken or anything but he still keeps talking about it all the time and trying to change my mind in various ways. Given what he has shown me of the care of them, they are relatively easy to take care of too. I have no ""real"" reason to reject this request other than my phobia. My wife mentioned this the other day and said she agreed with my choice but felt bad for him. I do too. So AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-05,"AITA for not allowing my son to get a pet tarantula?

Also before anybody asks, I never kill spiders, I let my wife (39F) or my sons put them outside.

I just don't think I would be comfortable in the house knowing that such a creature is living with me. For example, what if it escapes? My son has said that tarantulas never have to come out of their cage or be touched, but even if the chances are extremely low they are still there. But this phobia is my only reason for refusing him. He is a very responsible kid and he would 100% be able to take care of it, I am given to understand they only need to be watered and fed and he has demonstrated the ability to be responsible for a pet before. 

We discussed jumping spiders which are a bit more tolerable to me but those apparently have short lives like most bugs so he's not interested. I told him I was sorry but I would have to veto the idea of getting one. My wife and my younger son (11M) are on his side (his brother is more just supporting him/also thinks spiders are cool rather than being as invested as he is) but my wife suggested a policy of everybody in the household has to agree with a pet which I 100% agree with, it is not fair to the animal even if it's just a bug I think it's better to err on the side of caution and thinking of it as an animal. 

He said he wanted one because he ""wanted a friend who could be with him for a long time"", which resonated with me, I was introverted as a kid too and felt less lonely through my own weird hobbies, of course he deserves as much too. He's not heartbroken or anything but he still keeps talking about it all the time and trying to change my mind in various ways. Given what he has shown me of the care of them, they are relatively easy to take care of too. I have no ""real"" reason to reject this request other than my phobia. My wife mentioned this the other day and said she agreed with my choice but felt bad for him. I do too. So AITA?",0.0,1.0550986528396606,1,0
92,1f9fl9y,AITA for complimenting my group project partner for their skill.,"I (22M) am a computer science student and signed up for a course late and ended up with a randomly assigned project partner.

This is a fairly advanced class and the project is somewhat open ended so you can chose to go 'above and beyond' if you want to or just go with what is taught in the course.

I was assigned this girl as my project partner let's call her Alison who I knew but hadn't spoken much to before. Now everyone in my year has some general idea of the top students like the ones in the robotics clubs etc winning competitions for the school and Alisson wasn't one of them. She always seemed a little out of place because she's a year older as she switched majors from psychology to computer science and she is always dressed very differently than everyone.

She shows up to class and even finals in fancy looking dresses, always extremely done up in makeup, wears heels all the time and has these ridiculously long nails, it's funny watching her type.

While it's true there's less women in the program, none of them are as out of place as her and in this class I think there's only two other girls.

We met to discuss our project ideas and I noticed that all her ideas were really pushing the 'above and beyond' part and many of which would involve very specialist knowledge well beyond what is taught in undergraduate classes (in this case some very complex 3D processing techniques on the GPU and low level optimizations). I was fine with learning new things but was concerned whether we'd be able to manage to learn and also implement it.

I mentioned this and she was like oh it isn't a problem, I know GPU programming well and the math quite well and I could teach you if you'd like.

I was surprised especially since I knew she was a psychology major before and I said something like ""Wow that's impressive, I didn't expect someone like you to know about those things"". 

She got upset all of a sudden at me and told me rudely that just because she is a woman doesn't mean she can't know things.

I said it's not that really but just that she didn't come across as the type to be into that and I knew that she was in psyc before.

She then explained that she was always into cs and math as a kid but thought of it more as a hobby than a career and only took psychology initially as she thought she'd learn new stuff and enjoy it but then realized she would enjoy working in CS anyway and didn't want it to be just a hobby.

AITA here? I feel like it is such an unconventional thing, like who treats cs as a hobby if they like it and most people would probably think the same especially as she wasn't well known in clubs etc and doesn't socialize much with the other students.

No confirmation of the meeting is made as this is established. 

This week I couldn‚Äôt meet on Thursday for personal reasons, we talked last week and agreed to meet Tuesday instead. Same plan, same everything except for the day. We usually go to the same place but had mentioned we wanted to try something new and I sent her a few options during the day. She sent me a voice note saying she‚Äôll look at them and she was going to a meeting and she‚Äôll text me later. She sent a voice note to me until around 7 pm saying she had arrived to her friends house that asked for help, there were like 30 more seconds in the voice note where nothing could be heard. She knew I was just waiting for her to text me and was ready to leave home, as every week. I just told her that since she was telling me she was at her friends house I was assuming we were not meeting that night. 
Her friend had an urgent, not emergency, matter she needed help with. I understand that and I‚Äôm not upset about her helping obviously. But I did mentioned that I would have expected at least the courtesy of being let known beforehand since she knew I was just waiting for her. 

My friend even accepted that she thought it was nothing important at first but when she got to her friends house realized it did needed to be taken care of that moment, so they did. That it wasn‚Äôt an emergency and she was fine and she was sorry, she should have let me know she would not meet with me but she forgot.
Next morning I reiterated it was fine and I was happy that helped her friend. But I just felt very dismissed by not even being given a heads up. She knew she was not going to make it to meet me even if it did turned out to be nothing with her friend, yet she never said anything. 
She then flipped her story and said since it was an emergency (it was not) the last thing on her mind was to let me know because she rushed to help her. Then said that she did in fact remember and told me but that it was conveniently in the part of the voice note that has no sound. 

I know it doesn‚Äôt seem too important and I am a bit hung up on it, but this is not the first time that something like this happens.

Well recently there was an issue occurred at my get together for the wedding party. There was a comment made about my mom from my dad‚Äôs wife that wasn‚Äôt nice no one heard but me and my dad. I was upset & pretty much went off on my dad. His wife did apologize but I just couldn‚Äôt seem to get over it. Well to the point at hand, my bridesmaids will be wearing burnt orange & my fianc√©s mom/my mom will be wearing teal. My dad‚Äôs wife has decided to wear burnt orange I have asked her to not wear either color because that‚Äôs the color of my bridesmaids/moms well she has an issue because she‚Äôs feeling I shouldn‚Äôt tell anyone what they can & can‚Äôt wear.

She isn‚Äôt understanding why I don‚Äôt want her to wear the colors of my wedding party, she isn‚Äôt apart of the wedding. AITA ? 

Edit(questions) i want to answer a few questions below.

I have not told all my guest to stay away from these colors. When messaging her I did say if she didn‚Äôt know then I would have understood but she did know. Plus I have physically showed my bridesmaids dress to her. 

She hasn‚Äôt purchased the dress yet, so I stated I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs hard to change the color of the dress when she hasn‚Äôt purchased it yet. She stated she is picky and has looked everywhere and it‚Äôs difficult to find one 

She is my dad‚Äôs wife, not my stepmother. They have been married a little over a year. Just because she is my dad‚Äôs wife she shouldn‚Äôt feel initialed to be apart of my wedding party. When they got married they didn‚Äôt want to have their children in the wedding party, I had no issue with it. It was their wedding not mine. 

I did have some issues with her but I always kept quiet because of my dad. I didn‚Äôt want to have that separation, but since the comment about my mom just crossed the line for me. It was the first time they even met so they shouldn‚Äôt have been any issues. 

My dad on going to our bachelorette/Bachelor party, but now they aren‚Äôt going because what was said and don‚Äôt want issues. So that makes me upset because now there‚Äôs issues. 

I wasn‚Äôt planning excluding her from any pictures.

* ""And she is not just friends with me and my sister. She is also friends with Mason and Jamie.""
* ""So that's 4 people. And some of the other people coming are friends with less.""
* ""Just because you don't want to hang out with her isn't enough reason for her not to go. She is an amazing friend to me and I love her.""
* ""Asking me to say she can't go isn't something I will respond kindly to.""
* ""Let's all be inclusive and not try on our mean girl shoes here. Because it's not really going to affect anyone if she comes or not.""

**I replied:**

* ""Jordan, if it‚Äôs really important to you that Ella comes, then absolutely, let's have her there. This is your prom dinner night, and I want you to have the best time possible.""
* ""Although this is nowhere near the same as Connor and I bringing our dates.""
* ""Ella isn't a part of our group. The original prom dinner idea was for the core group to bring their dates and all of us hang out. Ella isn‚Äôt your date, especially not if she‚Äôs bringing her boyfriend.""
* ""I don‚Äôt appreciate the way you snapped back and told me to stop explaining myself. If that wasn't a moment you wanted to talk about it, I'd rather you ask to talk later instead of shutting me down. Thank you for taking the time to text me.""
* ""I‚Äôm not trying to exclude Ella because I don‚Äôt like her. When she sits with us at lunch, people complain. I‚Äôm not trying to kick her out or force you to uninvite her. But the common feedback is 'Why is she sitting with us again?'""
* ""Ella can be fun, but she‚Äôs not part of the friend group. She‚Äôs a plus one from you, which feels awkward, especially with limited seating.""
* ""I've talked with Jamie. She likes Ella but agreed with Jasper and me that inviting her might be too much.""

Later, I asked Jordan and Taylor if they were okay with not inviting Ella, because they hadn‚Äôt said anything when she invited herself. They both erupted at me in class, scolding me heavily. Later Jordan texted:

* ""Okay, Ella is going to go and that's final. I can tell her not to interact with you if you would like. But it's literally 15 people.""
* ""And she is not just friends with me and my sister. She is also friends with Mason and Jamie.""
* ""So that's 4 people. And some of the other people coming are friends with less.""
* ""Just because you don't want to hang out with her isn't enough reason for her not to go. She is an amazing friend to me and I love her.""
* ""Asking me to say she can't go isn't something I will respond kindly to.""
* ""Let's all be inclusive and not try on our mean girl shoes here. Because it's not really going to affect anyone if she comes or not.""

**I replied:**

* ""Jordan, if it‚Äôs really important to you that Ella comes, then absolutely, let's have her there. This is your prom dinner night, and I want you to have the best time possible.""
* ""Although this is nowhere near the same as Connor and I bringing our dates.""
* ""Ella isn't a part of our group. The original prom dinner idea was for the core group to bring their dates and all of us hang out. Ella isn‚Äôt your date, especially not if she‚Äôs bringing her boyfriend.""
* ""I don‚Äôt appreciate the way you snapped back and told me to stop explaining myself. If that wasn't a moment you wanted to talk about it, I'd rather you ask to talk later instead of shutting me down. Thank you for taking the time to text me.""
* ""I‚Äôm not trying to exclude Ella because I don‚Äôt like her. When she sits with us at lunch, people complain. I‚Äôm not trying to kick her out or force you to uninvite her. But the common feedback is 'Why is she sitting with us again?'""
* ""Ella can be fun, but she‚Äôs not part of the friend group. She‚Äôs a plus one from you, which feels awkward, especially with limited seating.""
* ""I've talked with Jamie. She likes Ella but agreed with Jasper and me that inviting her might be too much.""

**Ex responded:**

* ""I'm not going to take the time to respond to all of this.""
* ""Even if some people find Ella annoying, I'm sure they don't dislike her enough to have it ruin the night.
* ""Girl, it isn‚Äôt important.""
* ""It literally one person coming in 15.""
* ""So I don't think anyone cares.""
* ""Which means it's not important.""

In the end, Ella didn‚Äôt come, and us guys are all still friends, we even went camping just the guys a couple weeks ago.(names are changed)",1.0,1.046209692955017,1,1
99,1f9ekos,AITAH for not making it to a wedding?,"I‚Äôll try to keep this as concise as possible. 

Last year a childhood friend of mine that I‚Äôve known for 20 years is getting married. He and our friend group used to be very close elementary school through college. After we graduated he and our friend group stayed in our home town. I‚Äôve moved out of state several time  due to my job. As such I‚Äôve felt like the black sheep feeling unappreciated (not invited to things, rarely reached out to etc) for the last few years. We‚Äôve essentially grown apart, me from them, with friction here and there. 

My friend and his fianc√© set the date for their wedding around a year ago for this October on the other side of the country. I RSVP‚Äôd around April. In May I lost my job (non disciplinary and not performance related). I‚Äôm also diagnosed with major depressive disorder and insomnia which I‚Äôve really struggled with the last year. This isn‚Äôt super important I just struggle with a lot and he and my friend group were not there for me when others were. I‚Äôm still unemployed but I have been working to find a job that pays anything close to my previous one. I‚Äôve had zero offers. This alone has made life very difficult supporting myself, bills, a mortgage by myself and my mental health. 

I talked to him in person about it and there wasn‚Äôt much criticism. He asked today via text if I for sure wouldnt be there. I said without a job it would be very difficult, or if I do miraculously get a job what if I have to move just before the wedding. He was very upset at me asking why I didn‚Äôt save money knowing it was a year out, that this was planned well in advance and that he wishes I would see his side with how much he is spending for his wedding and that there are many side jobs I could be doing. I just signed up to be a Lyft and Uber driver and applied to ~20 non degree jobs in my area just to have some income (I have a degree). 

I feel like I‚Äôm being guilt tripped for not being in a good position to go. I want to be at this wedding but spending over $1,000 when I don‚Äôt have much to give and struggling in many ways is really hard. What sucks too is I know my friend group won‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôll be ‚Äúwhy didn‚Äôt he just do xyz‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe he didn‚Äôt go.‚Äù Things are very simple to them, they all have good jobs and relationships. And when I‚Äôve voiced hardship in the past there‚Äôs always an easy solution to them.

100,1f9ehhz,AITA for expressing that I found my mom's cooking meaningful after my wife said that she does not like it,"A bit of background information: My wife and I just got married this year. We have to live with my parents because this is the only place I can afford while having to take care of four people, including myself, and I wanted to do so. My parents have already come back to their hometown for three months, and my mom is returning home soon, later this month.

Yesterday my wife was distressed because mom is coming back to the house after her trip. She said it's not much freedom for her and she dislikes my mom's cooking. I tried comforting her by saying that if both of us were busy with work, my parents were here to help and support us by taking care of us. She argued that she didn't need this support, and she didn't want to eat separately either because it looked bad from the parent's side. I tried asking for what she wanted so that I could accommodate but the only thing she wanted was to move out and live just us 2 - which is not possible due to our circumstances.

That's when I shared with her that mom's cooking is something really meaningful to me. It might be different to her since she was raised in a different family and might have been used to a different taste. I didn't think much when I shared it, I wanted her to understand my perspective to work things out together and potentially sheer the conversation in a more positive way.

This is where my wife found it offensive. She said that this was something that she already knew or could figure out and that I didn't need to share. If I needed to share, then just share on a different day, not at the exact moment where she's telling me that she dislikes my mom's cooking. I tried explaining to her that it is very hard for me to know if something I say will be offensive to her because it's very subjective. I simply shared my thoughts because we're talking about the same topic and perhaps when I shared my perspective on how I perceive my mom's cooking differently, the conversation would start more positively. My wife said that it was offensive because I shared an opinion that contradicted her idea instead of sympathising with her and told me that this is not how I should treat other people. She said it is an indication of a low EQ, suggesting that I ask other people to see if they see the same. I wanted to solve things between us since conflict must be resolved internally between us instead of depending on others, but she insisted so that's why I posted it here.

Things started escalating further from here. It also hurt me because I tried to share something, but instead of getting any understanding from my wife, all I got back was a lesson from her. I asked her why she didn't deal with things differently, instead of criticising me she could just acknowledge and work things out together to see what we should do. She said that she only does things that she thinks it's morally correct.

Adding more information here since others are requesting:

1. Why can't your parents live by themselves? We're immigrant family, we're asian culture to be more specific. In my family only me and my wife can speak English as a second language, my parents don't. They simply can't navigate around with themselves.
2. Are you the only one who is working? Yes, I'm the only one to work in my family, my wife is still studying.
3. Can my parents go back to their hometown? No, we want to move here for a better live, we sold everything we have to afford a place to live here. Because of that we have to live together.
4. Are my parents going to live with us permanent? Yes, they will live with us permanently.

5.Why are my parents going back to my hometown and returning?  
They're going back for a short amount of time only because we have to take care of something there and it needs their presence. Anyways the reason why they're going back there is not important but they're returning to settle our life here.

5. Do we share the same culture?  
Yes, we're all asian (from the same country)

6. Why doesn't my wife like my mom's cooking?  
Different part of where I'm from have different ways to cook. Moreover, with my dad diabetes, what we can eat daily is limited, including not allowing to use too many carbs and sugar during our meals.

7. Cant your wife cook or eat separately?

She didn't want to do so since it's disrespectful to the elderly not to have dinner together as a family.

8. Does my wife know that she's going to live with my parents before marriage?  
Yes she knows and agrees to it. She also knows that the decision to buy a house and live together.

I,(27m) am married to my wife (25f), who I will call Kate (fake name). Kate is pregnant with our second child, we recently found out we are having a baby girl. While we were discussing different baby names I suggested Charlotte (fake name). 

Charlotte was my childhood best friend who unfortunately passed away when we were 18 in a car crash. The two of us were friends for our whole lives, once she left my life I told myself I would name one of my children after her. It just so happened that we are having a daughter next. 

The issue is my mother was convinced me and Charlotte would get married. Neither me nor her liked each other in that way. My mother consequently hates Kate. She has never been afraid of telling Kate she will never be Charlotte. Whenever things like that come up we always leave, as neither of us want to listen to her ramble. I‚Äôve always told my mother that I love Kate, and she needs to drop her resentment towards her. It has gotten to the point where I have dropped my mother from my family and life. I couldn‚Äôt take her degrading my wife anymore.

Recently I have been working on a big project that is demanding and confusing and I just wanted a short break from it to go and do something else.

I told my partner that I was going to leave the room for a minute and go and put my drone batteries on charge as I haven't gotten around to it yet.

I went to the bedroom to put the batteries on charge and ended up sitting there for about half an hour researching about a new drone I would love to buy as I still wasn't really in the headspace to return to work.

After about 15 mins she messaged me from the living room asking if there is anything wrong with the drone because I have taken a while, I told her I got distracted and am procrastinating and she said that I have been sat there for ages and that its pretty concerning.

I continued looking at videos of the drone and ended up coming back down to my laptop after around 30 mins from when I originally up there.

She then brought up that she isn't happy and that I am not taking her feelings into consideration and should have told her that I was going for an extended period of time instead of just for a minute and that its really concerning.

I then explained that we are literally in the same house and to be in a different room for 30 mins shouldn't be concerning in any way. I don't believe that we need to give constant updates or keep an eye on each other 24/7.

I went to the bedroom to put the batteries on charge and ended up sitting there for about half an hour researching about a new drone I would love to buy as I still wasn't really in the headspace to return to work.

After about 15 mins she messaged me from the living room asking if there is anything wrong with the drone because I have taken a while, I told her I got distracted and am procrastinating and she said that I have been sat there for ages and that its pretty concerning.

I continued looking at videos of the drone and ended up coming back down to my laptop after around 30 mins from when I originally up there.

She then brought up that she isn't happy and that I am not taking her feelings into consideration and should have told her that I was going for an extended period of time instead of just for a minute and that its really concerning.

I then explained that we are literally in the same house and to be in a different room for 30 mins shouldn't be concerning in any way. I don't believe that we need to give constant updates or keep an eye on each other 24/7.

106,1f9dy7p,AITA for not asking whether my mom wanted a hotdog,"

Ever since I gave birth, my mother (70) has been helping me (33) and my husband out with our baby. 
Generally, she watches the baby while we work (8-5), and she also makes baby breakfast and cooks lunch for everyone (both of us WFH). My husband generally makes dinner. She‚Äôs been a great help, and I honestly would be a mess without her.

Today, my husband and I ate a hotdog after work (around 5:30), and proceeded to sleep afterwards since baby was asleep. We didn‚Äôt get up until close to 9PM to make dinner.

My mom told me she was very angry at us because we‚Äôre not thoughtful of her. She says she‚Äôs been hungry since she only had lunch. When she grabbed leftovers from the fridge, she realized we had hotdogs and didn‚Äôt even bother to offer her one. I told her that I didn‚Äôt think of it as a meal, just a snack and she usually refuses when I ask her if she wants food so I didn‚Äôt bother this time around. We had planned to make dinner as usual.

I apologized and said I‚Äôll make sure to ask her next time, but she‚Äôs still so angry that she‚Äôs refusing dinner. But please give me the judgement based on the previous info.

You know everything at first was perfect, he was basically everything I wanted in a guy and I fell HARD. The first time I cried in front of him it was fine, he held me and told me it‚Äôll be okay. But sometimes we get into arguments and overtime he slowly started to get really annoyed by it.  I don‚Äôt so well in arguments, my mom used to have an abusive ex that constantly got up in me and my siblings faces screaming. Now everytime he raises his voice slightly or anyone I can‚Äôt help but shut down and start crying. The second he thinks I‚Äôm gonna cry he threatens me by saying things like ‚Äúif your gonna start crying you‚Äôre sleeping on the floor‚Äù or ‚Äúif you start that you can pack your shit and leave‚Äù. It hurts so bad because I just want him to comfort me, I don‚Äôt want to cry but when it starts it doesn‚Äôt stop.

First we were at a bar I had never been to with his aunt and uncle, I had to go to the bathroom but I was tipsy and didn‚Äôt know where it was. So I asked him if he could show me, he replied by saying ‚Äòyou can find it yourself‚Äô. His aunt told him he should show me bc a man could grab me, Im a smaller girl. I think that‚Äôs when he started to get agitated. So his uncle ended up showing me where it was. Fast forward he was dropping me off at his house bc him, his aunt and uncle were going to another bar. I could tell he was annoyed, everytime I tried to talk to him he would get really sassy. So I wasn‚Äôt feeling the greatest when we were at his place.

I was getting ready to take a shower so I just ignored him hope he would just go to the bar but he followed me into the bathroom and continued to tell if I was still crying by the time he got back I had to leave. That just made me cry more so he started raising his voice more, I tried telling him just leave but he wouldn‚Äôt. He just kept saying he hated it when I cry about nothing, or he‚Äôs gonna give me a reason to cry. I was in the shower at this point balling my eyes out bc I just wanted him to go.

We immigrated to the US 3 years ago to get away from my father, and have stayed thanks to my brother and I's American citizenship. Last year, my mom got her current job. The problem is that this is not enough money for the household expenses. On her salary, we would normally be able to afford our current lifestyle. However, legal fees from the divorce and her getting spiritual work done have both made it so she is in a constant deficit, and she currently has a bit of credit card debt. In order to help, I've been giving her $50 dollars a week for the past 4 months. I usually give her some more, as I've covered the broken fridge, microwave and air conditioner, along with groceries sometimes and my cat's medical bills. Due to my past, I currently suffer with PTSD, anxiety and have BED. This situation has made me incredibly stressed and has worsened some of my mental health issues, but I've pushed through because I love my mom and I want to help.

However, I started college last week. I am currently enrolled in my community college's honors program and have a full ride scholarship. My aim is to go to an ivy league with a full ride, so I need to get really good grades and extracurricular activities. Consequently, I asked to cut down my hours at work (from 3 days to 2). Furthermore, my mom got $1,300 from her uncles last week. Based on this, I asked her to get support from them instead of me until the divorce ends in 2 months. She said it was okay and not to worry, but today she was screaming at me in the car. She told me I was a narcissist like my father, that I was selfish with my money and freakishly obsessed with not having any debt on my credit card (which I am), that she thought I'd send her the $50 this week and that I'd stop late September, and that her friend was starving and I couldn't have the decency to help her. I don't understand why she would need the $600 (give or take) that I would give her these next 2 months if she has $1300 extra dollars. I also don't understand why my part time job has to be covering so much household stuff. I wanted to get my own car but I only have $550 dollars in savings because of how much I've given her.

110,1f9d1vl,AITA for calling the police on my neighbor for singing karaoke ,"My neighbor won‚Äôt stop singing karaoke and it is driving me crazy! When I say they won‚Äôt stop, I mean it goes on at all hours. During the day, in the morning, and well into the night. I woke up at 3:00am to use the bathroom the other night and they were still going. And what makes it worse is that they are so bad! It is some of the worst singing that I have ever heard. I have to sleep with a fan going full blast to drown out the noise sometimes. 

I have a small child and another on the way, so I don‚Äôt want their sleep to be interrupted. I have had to call the none emergency line several times to get them to stop. It will stipe for a few days sometimes weeks and then they start doing it later and later again. Some of my family and friends understand why I am so frustrated, but some of them say to let them have their fun. 

This has been going on for a little while and I feel silly that I even have to involve the police, but I don‚Äôt know what else to do! Should I send them a letter, put a note on their door, or just keep calling the police. I don‚Äôt want to waste the police‚Äôs time, but what else am I supposed to do? 

Edit: 
I wrote this quickly and without a lot of detail, so I will add a little bit more here. 

I live in a house and so does my neighbor, so I can hear them from inside their house. I do not have my windows open. I also do not live in an HOA, so there is no one to complain to. I can also tell that they are singing into microphones, that is why it gets so loud. People will walk by on the street and laugh, because it is so loud and bad. The people that live there are an older woman and her son. We know that the son is in and out of jail for several different things and the woman can be a bit forgetful. 

I do not feel comfortable talking to the son about this, because he scares me and I don‚Äôt want to be on his bad side. We have had to call the police for a few different because of him. There is a lot of comings and goings from the house. One time when someone else called the police on them we were outside doing yard work and one of the officers asked us to keep an eye out for anything weird going on there. So, you can only guess what they are doing there. 

I would be okay with talking to the woman, she is actually very nice and we would shovel her snow in the winter if the son didn‚Äôt. I just don‚Äôt know if I knock on the door if she would answer or if it would be him. 

I will add more information if needed. I also think I might send a letter or put one on their door and see if that helps. I appreciate everyone‚Äôs input and opinions.

112,1f9cpt2,AITA for not seeing my dad anymore?,"
I‚Äôm a teenager (16m) to be specific. I graduated early and I work full time and I have a girlfriend, my parents are also divorced and both married to another. So if that says anything, my life is pretty busy. Recently I had left my dad‚Äôs for a while because I was busy with work, house sitting for my sister, and also making time for my friends and family. I had spent Wednesday-Sunday with his family for 3 weeks in a row, and so I figured after house sitting it was only fair to do the same for my mother. When the weekends were changed I was not told of the change until it was happening and when I made it clear that I didn‚Äôt know I was looked at like I was stupid. Anywho, when I came back to his house after about 2 weeks of being gone, I went into my room, with it being trashed. My shoes were on my bed, there was trash on my floor, my guitar was knocked over, and the stuff that was on my dresser was all over my floor, and some of my stuff was missing. I went into my dad‚Äôs room and spoke to him and my stepmother and asked about it. Keep in mind it‚Äôd be stupid to leave my bedroom door open so I never do. They said how someone probably let the cats in there and they knocked stuff down. But I know that isn‚Äôt true because one of my trophies was sitting on my floor right side up which isn‚Äôt the way I left it. I also was missing clothes, and rechargeable batteries for my Xbox controller plus the charging dock for them. They said my stepsister had asked about batteries and they said to check my room. So I go into her room and I ask about my batteries, she‚Äôs using them to play an oculus (this is important later) and so she give them back, then I ask about the charging dock, and she looks around and says ‚ÄúI lost it.‚Äù So I toss the batteries on her bed and say ‚ÄúNevermind find it tomorrow.‚Äù I go back to my room and I call my girlfriend, and I tell her about it. I tell her how my stuff is used while I‚Äôm gone, my clothes are stolen (also by my stepsister), my batteries are stolen my room is altered or trashed, and it‚Äôs my breaking point. Here is where the Oculus is important. The Oculus was a gift to my biological sister who shares the same dad as me, and I gave it to HER. My stepsister was using it, with MY batteries.

Do you guys have any other options? What should I do?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-05,"AITA for not seeing my dad anymore? 
I‚Äôm a teenager (16m) to be specific. I graduated early and I work full time and I have a girlfriend, my parents are also divorced and both married to another. So if that says anything, my life is pretty busy. Recently I had left my dad‚Äôs for a while because I was busy with work, house sitting for my sister, and also making time for my friends and family. I had spent Wednesday-Sunday with his family for 3 weeks in a row, and so I figured after house sitting it was only fair to do the same for my mother. When the weekends were changed I was not told of the change until it was happening and when I made it clear that I didn‚Äôt know I was looked at like I was stupid. Anywho, when I came back to his house after about 2 weeks of being gone, I went into my room, with it being trashed. My shoes were on my bed, there was trash on my floor, my guitar was knocked over, and the stuff that was on my dresser was all over my floor, and some of my stuff was missing. I went into my dad‚Äôs room and spoke to him and my stepmother and asked about it. Keep in mind it‚Äôd be stupid to leave my bedroom door open so I never do. They said how someone probably let the cats in there and they knocked stuff down. But I know that isn‚Äôt true because one of my trophies was sitting on my floor right side up which isn‚Äôt the way I left it. I also was missing clothes, and rechargeable batteries for my Xbox controller plus the charging dock for them. They said my stepsister had asked about batteries and they said to check my room. So I go into her room and I ask about my batteries, she‚Äôs using them to play an oculus (this is important later) and so she give them back, then I ask about the charging dock, and she looks around and says ‚ÄúI lost it.‚Äù So I toss the batteries on her bed and say ‚ÄúNevermind find it tomorrow.‚Äù I go back to my room and I call my girlfriend, and I tell her about it. I tell her how my stuff is used while I‚Äôm gone, my clothes are stolen (also by my stepsister), my batteries are stolen my room is altered or trashed, and it‚Äôs my breaking point. Here is where the Oculus is important. The Oculus was a gift to my biological sister who shares the same dad as me, and I gave it to HER. My stepsister was using it, with MY batteries. And to make it even worse, I‚Äôve heard my bio sister ask if she can play HER oculus and she‚Äôs told ‚Äúno‚Äù by my stepsister. And nobody does a thing about it.

I was getting annoyed and kept saying various versions of I'm not feeling well until I finally just said it was my period.

I obviously don't agree with how periods are treated as shameful in general but of course I understand that some people are simply uncomfortable with discussing that. And honestly I also don't want people to be disgusted by me so I always just find some excuse when asked about it.

Anyway, Dina was not happy about this and said ""you can just SAY it's a period, it's not something to hide"" and started going on a long ass rant about how I'm stigmatizing periods etc etc. which I agree that periods are too stigmatized in general but in that specific moment I honestly didn't want to risk eliciting another disgusted reaction like I'm used to.

118,1f9bocc,AITA for washing my boyfriend‚Äôs pants?,"Hey gang. Settle a friendly debate between my boyfriend and I.

 This past weekend I was loading clothes into the washer when I noticed my boyfriend‚Äôs belt was still on his pants, so I took the belt off and handed it to him. I then continued to load the rest of the dirty clothes basket into the washer, add soap, and start the load. I went along with my day and 30 minutes later threw it all into the dryer. 

Meanwhile, he asked me if I had seen his earbuds in living room, I said no. I finished that load of laundry. Lo and behold the earbuds are in the Velcro closed cargo pocket of his pants. Ruined!

So the real dilemma, am I responsible for the ruined earbuds because I didn‚Äôt check the pockets, or should he have made sure to check them before putting the pants in the dirty laundry basket. Or, should we both have checked and are thus both responsible. 

Additionally, key details we think matter in our own stubborn ways: he was sick with the flu the day the pants went into the basket, I have made it clear (we have discussed) that anything in the aforementioned dirty laundry basket is fair game to be washed. Truly, we are lucky I saw the belt. 

Anywho, let us know what you think! He has fully proofread this and is also looking forward to the judgement of the public.

I (32F) have a daughter (14F). She just started high school. my daughter is special needs. 

My daughter is emotionally on par with an 8 year old. She is obviously not developmentally on target. This manifests in many ways, one being her ability to dress herself. to give her independence I have tried to accommodate this by making sure her clothes have elastic or drawstring waists. 

She‚Äôs only 4‚Äô7‚Äù. This makes it hard to find clothes that fit her. 

Now,the problem. We live in an area where it is very hot and students wear shorts, Knee length. I have financial constraints and due to the limitations between that and her disabilities, much of her wardrobe is bike shorts. They are not tight on her and again, she‚Äôs 14 but wears a smaller size. 

I have verified hers are fingertip length myself, checking her in the morning. There was a conversation had with her case manager and her therapist at the school about her dressing herself and we agreed to add provisions to her IEP, but her teacher gave her a hard time yesterday. I was told to make sure the shirt was the same length as the shorts. The therapist offered to send home some shirts. 

I took this to mean that the shirt had to be fingertip length.this morning, I check her and her shirt is fingertip length and the shorts were to her knee. When she comes home, she is in a different shirt and her shorts are no longer visible. I had expected shirts to be sent home but not for her to be wearing different clothes. 

I asked her what happened and she explained to me when she went in this morning, the lady in the front office made her change. But she explained this as ‚Äúchanged me‚Äù. The caseworker called, to set a date for her IEP meeting and I mentioned it. The caseworker told me to call the school and find out who told her to do that. I was never told the kids are required to change on campus, and being that I had already made them aware she does have issues dressing herself sometimes- between that and her inability to describe the situation clearly, it was therefore within the realm of possibility that someone did ‚Äúchange her‚Äù.

My 20-year-old niece started college two years ago, and since my husband, our one-year-old child, and I live in a one-bedroom apartment just a few minutes‚Äô walk from her university, my mom asked if we could let her stay with us. I love her, so I said yes. She has the bedroom while we sleep in the living room. Initially, she was really helpful, but that only lasted about two months. Over the past two years, she‚Äôs stopped helping out unless I specifically ask her. She never does the laundry, and what really pushed me over the edge was discovering that she‚Äôs been using my clothes as rags to wipe her feet and the floor. This explains why some of my clothes have stains and require handwashing.

When I ask her to do simple chores like the dishes, she often says she'll do them later, only to forget entirely. When I end up doing them myself, she pretends she was just about to do it but heard me doing it instead. Her room is always a mess, with clothes scattered everywhere, and she only cleans it once a month if I don‚Äôt step in. She won‚Äôt even change her sheets or pillowcases unless I do her laundry.

This situation is incredibly exhausting for me. On top of working from 9 pm to 6 am, I‚Äôm also taking care of our toddler and handling all the household chores during the day. My husband helps when he's not out of town for work, which is the only time I can manage about six hours of sleep; otherwise, I‚Äôm barely getting one or two hours a night. There was one instance where my husband did the laundry to let me sleep. After an hour, he woke me up because he found underwear with period stains. I told him that what he was washing was my niece's laundry basket, not mine. He was so grossed out that he threw away all the underwear, stained or not. I was so embarrassed.

What really gets to me is that, in addition to everything else, I‚Äôm also paying part of her tuition, and she‚Äôs living with us for free‚Äîcovering all her food, water, and electricity costs. A little help wouldn‚Äôt hurt, especially if it‚Äôs just washing her own clothes. I've spoken to my mom about it, and I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôs mentioned it to my niece, but nothing has changed. When I told my niece‚Äôs mom, all I got was an ""ok"" reply. She can‚Äôt help because she barely provides for herself and her husband. Their family situation is a mess, and I try to stay out of it, but they‚Äôre both irresponsible parents.

My other sister, who lives abroad, and I are the ones covering my niece's university tuition, and sometimes I have to work overtime to make sure I have enough money for her. It hurts my feelings because it seems like she doesn‚Äôt care enough to help out even a little. I often see her lounging around with her headset on, doing her makeup, or watching movies in bed. When it‚Äôs mealtime, if she doesn‚Äôt come out to eat, I have to bring food to her bedroom; otherwise, it goes to waste, and I hate wasting money since we work so hard to provide for her.

Because of all this, I've started giving her short replies when she talks to me, and I'm not engaging in our usual conversations. It seems like she‚Äôs getting shy around me, and I‚Äôm starting to feel like I might be the one in the wrong here.

123,1f9aodh,AITA for suggesting my daughter get rid of some of her stuffed animals? ,"My 40f daughter 11f has a mountain of stuffed animals on her bed, and another in her closet, and another in a corner of her room. 

She loves them all, she still sleeps with many of them and hugs them and plays with them. I have been concerned lately that maybe she is getting a bit too old for stuffed animals.

 I thought it would be a good thing for her to maybe get rid of some of them and make room in her room for more mature things. I don't mean get rid of ALL of them but just a fair amount to clear out some space in her room for other things like maybe books ( she doesn't like reading but we are trying to get her into it ), or art or any variety of things that could be more appropriate for some one her age then just so many stuffed animals. 

I suggested this to her and she got really upset saying she loved her stuffed animals and didn't want to give them away. I told her I didn't mean all of them but just enough to clear some room in her room for more things for some one her age. 

She got really upset and I didn't want to upset her further so I just left.

 I told my husband 41m about this and he said I was wrong to try and force her to give away her stuffed animals, he said she loves them and ask me didn't I think it was so cute and sweet how much she still loves her stuffed animals, I told him yes it is very cute and sweet that she still loves her stuffed animals and she looks very cute with them. But I thought we should be encouraging her to do more mature things and not act so immature. 

He said it's kinda mean to try to force our daughter to get rid of her stuffed animals and thinks I should apologize to her.

125,1f9aevy,AITA if I go against the wishes of my entire fantasy football league? ,"I am dealing with a situation in one of my fantasy leagues that makes me feel like I'm taking CRAZY PILLS. For context, it‚Äôs a standard 12-man, half-point PPR league through ESPN. We have one Injured Reserve (IR) spot, and I placed Jonathan Brooks, who is designated as ‚ÄòOUT,‚Äô into that spot. Now, everyone is losing their minds because he isn't technically designated as ‚ÄòIR‚Äô and therefore shouldn't be eligible for the slot.

My argument hinges on two points:

1. The ESPN website allowed me to use the spot for a player with the ‚ÄòOUT‚Äô designation.
2. This exact scenario is something that ESPN fan support explicitly says is an acceptable use of the spot. The website states, ‚ÄúThe system automatically places the IR (Injured Reserve) tag on a player once ESPN receives the status report from the NFL. Only players with the Injured/Reserve (IR) or Out (O) tags are eligible for placement into an IR slot. Players tagged as Questionable (Q) or Doubtful (D) are not eligible for the IR slot.‚Äù That language, in my opinion, makes it clear that I am using the IR spot correctly.

The main argument against me is based on a precedent from three years ago when I had a player in the Injured Reserve spot who then became healthy. This annoyed the league, and they argued that the spot is only for ‚Äúinjured players‚Äù and not healthy ones, so they made me remove him. This, again, is a situation that ESPN fan support explicitly says is okay. The website states, ‚ÄúIf you have a healthy player in an IR slot, you cannot add any new players to your roster.‚Äù So, while this is a disadvantage for the person doing it, ESPN allows it and does not consider it a violation of the rules. I lost that argument even though I don't think I was in the wrong.

Fast forward to this year, and everyone is telling me that my current situation‚Äîhaving someone designated ‚ÄòO‚Äô in the ‚ÄòIR‚Äô spot‚Äîhas already been settled, and they act like I'm crazy for bringing it up again. But I believe these are two different issues, and our decision not to allow healthy players in the IR spot should be independent of the decision not to allow players designated ‚ÄòOUT‚Äô in that spot.

I basically feel like this is an arbitrary rule that explicitly goes against how the website says we can use the spot, and we are splitting hairs between ‚ÄòIR‚Äô and ‚ÄòO‚Äô. This isn‚Äôt just an ESPN fantasy issue either; I know that at least [NFL.com](http://NFL.com) allows you to use the ‚ÄòIR‚Äô spot in the exact same way. My biggest complaint is that they keep saying, ‚ÄúWe decided this three years ago,‚Äù and other things of that nature, even though I think this is a distinctly new issue. This is my brother-in-law's league filled with his friends most of which I don't know and I kind of feel like im getting railroaded.

I had gotten her a birthday present that she did not like because she didn't think it was meant for her and I had regifted it from somewhere (I didnt). 
She said her love language is quality time anyway and she'd prefer just to hang out together. She quoted that I always hang out with my mom and she sees the photos my mom posts about going to all these great places with her and she feels like I don't put her on the same level essentially. 

Here's where I'm feeling a certain way:
1. When my mom invites me somewhere she usually pays 90% of the time because she is the one to invite me out. Occasionally I cover a lunch bill or if we go to a place I suggested but usually my mom foots the bill because she makes more than me. Whereas my mother in law if we can find somewhere that fits her taste (she nit picks on choices and it cant have alcohol cause shes a bad drinker) she offers to pay and it gets thrown back in my face in another argument later on that she ""always covers it"". Anywhere we go I offer to pay my way cause I know cash is tight and shes quick to hole it against me but she doesn't accept it.
2. I can't hangout at her house without dosing myself with allergy meds. She has a gorgeous little doggy but I'm allergic. If I am there for too long it's hard to breathe.
3. A relationship is a two way street. I work a full time job, have therapy sessions regularly, and doctors appointments so im very busy. In this regard i know sometimes i slack on communicating and reaching out to people. Sometimes ive went weeks to months forgetting to reach out to friends to check in. However she doesn't contact me to hangout either. I go over if my fiance asks if I wanna come but it's not like she hits me up to hangout first. 

From her point of view yes I hangout with my own mom more but that's also because I'm in therapy with my mom so have to see her regularly (family drama forced us to break generational curses so we have to heal from it through therapy to keep up our relationship) and my mom lives at my family's house so I go there regularly to take care of my pets that live there (fiance and I can't bring my pets to where we live currently we're gonna start house hunting next year so we can take them).
Am I overreacting? How much is a normal amount to hangout with a mother in law?

131,1f99r8c,WIBTA for not letting my husband see the kids before he goes away to work for 1 year?,"My husband and I have 2 little girls- 2.5 years and 1.5 year old. He travels a lot for work and I have been the default parent while also working fulltime. He has been away for maximum 1 month at a time before. We are very used to his travels and our marriage and relationship is solid as is his bond with our girls.

Now he has has been tasked to stay 1 year away overseas for work. I took a week off work to spend time with him with the kids but his flight got postponed by a week. I couldn't take more time off work so I rejoined office. Now he is due to fly off in next 2 days. I am taking a day off to spend with him and then his flight will be  the next day.

Now I am adamant that I will not take our girls to see him off at the airport. We are clashing over this as he feels he needs to be able to spend every available moment he can with them till he gets on the plane. My reasoning is that both our toddlers are runners at the moment. They refuse to stay in a stroller for long and airport departures from check-in to boarding can get long. Also my oldest is very attached to her dad, so I expect a proper meltdown when she says goodbye. I also feel I need the final hours he has at the airport to be just mine with him. I cannot be stressing about the kids and I want to have a private personal goodbye with him. I have asked my mum to look after the girls when we go to the airport.

So WIBTA if I don't let my husband see the girls before he goes away? I can understand he is emotional about it.

Edit for clarification:

1. We are still happily married. And we will obviously be in touch multiple times a day through phone and video calls like we have been doing on his previous travels.
2. So his flight is on Saturday in the afternoon. I have taken Friday off to spend all day Friday with him with the kids. On Saturday, I am planning to have him say goodbye to the girls at home around midday. After which I can be with him at the airport till he goes through for boarding.
3. My oldest has had severe meltdowns everytime he has said goodbye before when he is home. He has opted to leave in secret or when she is sleeping, and telling her goodbye over the phone later.
4. We do not have leashes or anything of that sort. My husband and I jointly prefer not to have those. My youngest always prefers to be carried by me and my oldest likes to keep her daddy to herself only.

133,1f999ee,AITA for hanging up on my boss and telling her via text that she was demeaning to me? (TW),"I've been working for a tiny, family-owned company for over a decade now. Our business is very seasonal and  it's been getting more and more difficult to get customers over time, especially as inflation has climbed. We finally seemed to be bouncing back around 2017, but then took a series of hits including the Pandemic.

My boss, the owners' daughter, actively hid how poorly the company was doing from her dad because she claims she was afraid of how he would react, including taking out a massive loan in the company's name without informing him.

In June, she had some sort of falling out with her mother, who then threatened to tell her dad about the financial state of the company. In response, she took some rash actions that wound up with her in the hospital.

Since she was hospitalized the owners' granddaughter has taken over the books and has been trying to get the company's finances in order. Things have been more calm.

I learned today my former boss will be taking back over in January. She called me today and began to berate me over the phone about the collective decision to port the old book files into the new software instead of starting a new company file, because there are a bunch of unpaid invoices in the system from old clients that have never been written off, which has the owners wondering why so much money looks outstanding. Keep in mind, *I don't handle the bookkeeping.*

After explaining that abandoning the existing file would likely create other issues with the finances, she continued to tell me how it was a dumb idea. My response was, ""I'm sorry, I just don't know what else to say."" Her response?

""Of course you don't know what to say, that would be intelligent.""

I immediately hung up and dumped her calls, as I was hurt and infuriated.

She has repeatedly gotten upset with me when I try to explain things to her, because she says I insult her and ""sound just like my daddy."" But she often says things like this, and I hold my tongue because I've been afraid of hurting her feelings, especially given recent events.

She sent me the following after I put my phone on DND.

>You do realize that I will be taking this company back over so I suggest that you do not hang up on me again

>We used to could get along and have a conversation

>There was no need for you to hang up on me

>When you decide that you can have a civil conversation with me you can call me back

My response:

>There was also no need for you to say, ""Of course you don't know what to say, that would be intelligent."" That was deeply hurtful and demeaning. You have repeatedly fussed at me about how I speak to you, and when that has happened I have likely deserved it, but I don't think you understand that you can be very hurtful sometimes when speaking to me, too.

134,1f992s7,AITA for avoiding my mother?!,"I (24F)never post on here but I‚Äôm at a tipping point and therapy is too expensive so thought I‚Äôd give this a go and hear different perspectives. 

My mother (mid 50s), has always been known to as aggressive + short tempered amongst my siblings and I. She‚Äôs not your typical sweet doting mother but rather the aggressive my way or no way type. Even on a day to day, the way she talks is just very aggressive and intense. She can be in a super good mood but still speak aggressively. Also important to mention I am asian american so my mom is of asian descent (not sure if this affects anything tbh). 

My mom has always had really short temper and would have anger outbursts but it was only once in a while. Since 2020 (abt 4 years ago) her temper & mood swings have been OUT OF CONTROL. I believe it‚Äôs a mixture of things that has contributed to the shift: marriage problems, menopause, empty nest syndrome. What used to be once in a while BIG EXPLOSIVE fits, have now turned into a daily thing. She takes it out on me and my other sibling (she doesn‚Äôt take it out on my youngest sibling or the eldest). It‚Äôs so hard to stand because she would say VERY hurtful things that are unrelated to what triggered her outburst (call me an idiot, useless, etc). And the funny thing is, she takes one little mistake you do and EXPLODES. And it‚Äôs always her just using that minor mistake to take out her frustration on some other shit that she‚Äôs super angry about. 

Today she said sometime that altered my brain chemistry‚Ä¶ She was again have one of her BIG EXPLOSIVE fits in the car and yelling at my sibling when she blurted out ‚ÄúI have good temper doesn‚Äôt mean you guys can take it out on me‚Äù. I. WAS. SHOOK.
My initial thought was: she can‚Äôt actually believe she has good temper. But now that I think of it, I‚Äôm genuinely concerned that she thinks she has good temper. No way a person does not realize their issues‚Ä¶She needs serious help! 

I‚Äôm so exhausted from putting up with this behavior & taking in all her verbal abuse that I have been trying to avoid her at all costs. I feel bad because she‚Äôs my mom and I don‚Äôt want to ignore her‚Ä¶ But for my mental health sake, I just have to limit my interactions with her‚Ä¶

(I can already see the ‚Äúshe needs therapy‚Äù comments coming & no, that‚Äôs not an options because she doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy or believe she has any issues)

Also important to mention I am asian american so my mom is of asian descent (not sure if this affects anything tbh). 

My mom has always had really short temper and would have anger outbursts but it was only once in a while. Since 2020 (abt 4 years ago) her temper & mood swings have been OUT OF CONTROL. I believe it‚Äôs a mixture of things that has contributed to the shift: marriage problems, menopause, empty nest syndrome. What used to be once in a while BIG EXPLOSIVE fits, have now turned into a daily thing. She takes it out on me and my other sibling (she doesn‚Äôt take it out on my youngest sibling or the eldest). It‚Äôs so hard to stand because she would say VERY hurtful things that are unrelated to what triggered her outburst (call me an idiot, useless, etc). And the funny thing is, she takes one little mistake you do and EXPLODES. And it‚Äôs always her just using that minor mistake to take out her frustration on some other shit that she‚Äôs super angry about. 

Today she said sometime that altered my brain chemistry‚Ä¶ She was again have one of her BIG EXPLOSIVE fits in the car and yelling at my sibling when she blurted out ‚ÄúI have good temper doesn‚Äôt mean you guys can take it out on me‚Äù. I. WAS. SHOOK.
My initial thought was: she can‚Äôt actually believe she has good temper. But now that I think of it, I‚Äôm genuinely concerned that she thinks she has good temper. No way a person does not realize their issues‚Ä¶She needs serious help! 

I‚Äôm so exhausted from putting up with this behavior & taking in all her verbal abuse that I have been trying to avoid her at all costs. I feel bad because she‚Äôs my mom and I don‚Äôt want to ignore her‚Ä¶ But for my mental health sake, I just have to limit my interactions with her‚Ä¶

(I can already see the ‚Äúshe needs therapy‚Äù comments coming & no, that‚Äôs not an options because she doesn‚Äôt believe in therapy or believe she has any issues) 

So, AITA for avoiding my mother? ",0.0,-0.015603925101459026,0,1
135,1f98zsg,AITA for posting pictures of neighbor's cat online?,"I never thought I would ask people about such a frivolous issue but here we go I guess ü§∑

I live in an area where we have like 10 houses with a very small garden at the back and a private street with some space for parking cars/bikes or some plants...

We know all the neighbors and even if it's kinda difficult to have some privacy (we can all hear our neighbors talking during lunch in the garden for instance) we never had a big fight about anything as far as I can remember.

Since a few months, one of the neighbors has adopted a 3rd cat. The three cats live inside and outside and nobody cares, even if the oldest one can be pretty agressive. The new one is very friendly and after some weeks he naturally come to my house when the door is open and live his life. It's a kinda funny thing to me because I love cats (I dont have one because my gf doesnt like cats but is ok to let him in as far as I watch him and he stay a ""guest cat""), he does funny stuff... so I started taking pictures of him/with him and posted them online (instagram/facebook stories...).

The neighbor knew his cat come regularly to my house and doesnt care but he discovered yesterday the pictures and he and his wife are fucking mad. I cant even think about a valid reason, like he DMed me and later told me that it's his cat and I have no rights to post his cat online without asking him before, but I think thats fucked up since the cat is in my house and it's not like it's someone (I could 100% understand his tantrum if I posted pictures of his kid online but it's not the same, for me).

Now he is trying to rally other neighbors calling me a freak and social media attention whore (I have like 200 instagram followers and as many facebook friends, I'm not making any money with his cat). His cat followed me after I came home from work tonight and I took a selfie with him, I guess it will make the situation worse, but, unless I missed something, I really cant see how Im wrong (but I apparently am based on how my neighbor now see me).",Not the A-hole,2024-09-05,"AITA for posting pictures of neighbor's cat online?

136,1f98rpv,AITA for taking my son from his dad,"I know how it sounds but let me explain. I 21f had my son in March 2022 his dad 21m had terrible mental health so he wasnt at his birth and ended up meeting his kid till his first birthday march 2023. In October 2023 I had a breakdown and had him stay with his dad. I ended up moving for mental health reasons, and money reasons. Recently I just started to have to pay rent (normal adult stuff) so it added some stress. I'm the only one that works, his dad does his hobbies and hangs out with friends. I'd been talking to his dad (and others we live with) the past month about boundaries and how if those boundaries aren't respected I'm moving back. Well they haven't been respected. His dad was talking to me and he said he wanted to leave (I felt off by the way he said it I should've known) I said me too and he started get upset saying he doesn't want to leave here but also doesn't want to be away from his son. Aitah if I leave? I know he's his son but he seems more concerned about his comfort. I still want his dad in his life I just can't live here anymore.

TLDR: raised my son alone for a year and a half. Been living with my sons father and others for a little less than a year. It doesn't seem like a healthy place for me or a child so I'm moving back.
