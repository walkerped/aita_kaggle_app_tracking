0,1fa590p,AITA for pretending to be married to my bestfriend when I have a girlfriend?,"So for context I (25f) have worked a starbucks job for too long (eight months), and moved in with my girlfriend (28F) last year after knowing each other since high school, started dating two years ago. Anyway, I have a bestfriend since highschool (26f) who I'm just gonna call Will here. We always used to joke around and have fun, I didn't realize I was trans until I was 20 so we were normal guy friends until that, after that we're mostly the same but more over the top

Will comes into the store I work at pretty regularly and we'd joke around and stuff if there weren't a lot of people around. Eventually one of my coworkers asked if we were dating and I (forgetting they didn't know I was a lesbian and thinking they were joking) said ""oh year we got married last week, didn't I tell you?"". I didn't realize the mistake until later when I was leaving and they told me to say hi to him

That night we all hung out and I told them, we all thought it was funny and I forgot about it. A couple days later Will came in for coffee and my coworker got happy and said ""your husbands here"" and ran with it and got over the top sweet with petnames and compliments because it was both funny to us. I thought she'd catch on we were too sweet to be real, Will will follow any joke I start, she did not catch on

That started a six month game with me and Will where for the first couple months we just kept acting sweet and pretending we were making plans, just thinking it was a funny silly thing. After a while Will and I started coordinating in our free time, coming up with potentially over the top things and stories about what we did, and then for like the last three months we've been pretending to have regular fights over increasingly petty and absurd things. It kept me looking forward to work and it never got much farther than some fake flirting and hugs and a couple forehead kisses

Recently one of my coworkers apparently saw us on a date and pulled my girlfriend aside while I was in the bathroom and said ""hey just so you know she has a husband""

My girlfriend knew I was gay and living with her, so she was confused as fuck about this, asked me about it on the way home, I explained and she got a little confused at it. We ended up calling Will because it was still in the ""sort of funny this happened"" phase, and we talked about it and she seemed to think it was funny until Will asked if we should incorporate this into our game

She asked what we meant, and I explained we'd not only failed to correct my coworker's assumption and kept it up as a joke but also done the whole ""making up stories about our relationship and acting loveydovey"" thing. She got really mad at this and said it was gross and weird to do that, and it was a fucked up thing to do to my coworker. She also took a lot of issue with the fact we'd been hugging and (forehead) kissing as a joke, and said sheâ€™d have liked to at least know about that",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-09-06,"AITA for pretending to be married to my bestfriend when I have a girlfriend?

1,1fa55w2,AITA for complaining about an autistic guy,"I [18F] am an engineering student, and today I had multiple quizzes. I was kind of stressed already, but I became even more frustrated when an autistic guy [18M]  in my math class interrupted our quiz. Let's call him ""M."" For context, M is kind of weird. I don't really interact with him much. He brags about having autism, talks constantly over our professor, and he also got offended because nobody gave him any compliments on the trans pin on his backpack. 

I don't care what M does in his own free time, but I was already annoyed about him talking over the professor. Today, he decided to interrupt our math quiz which pissed me off even more. During the middle of the quiz, M suddenly stood up. He started talking super loud and saying that he ""has to take his ADHD medication at this time."" 

My main issue is how loud he was talking. He also didn't even approach our professor to tell him this. M just started talking while he was still standing by his seat. The professor ended up having to pull him out of class. I don't understand why M wouldn't just walk up to our professor and whisper instead of doing this. Our professor even told us what time the quiz would be. M could easily have told him this at the beginning of the quiz or right before it. 

As soon as M started complaining about having to take his meds, I could not focus anymore. And this quiz was especially important. For this class, we only have five quizzes and three exams. We aren't graded on anything else. I think I did okay on the quiz regardless of M interrupting, but I'm still really annoyed. 

M is in college so he's probably moderate or high functioning. I kinda feel like he should know better. I was complaining about M today to my friend on the phone. I was in my room during the call, and my roommate overheard me when she came in. She called me ""cruel"" and told me I should have sympathy for M. I don't have a problem with M himself, I just want him to stop interrupting class. 


Edit: I forgot to mention, but M didn't even apologize for interrupting the quiz. He just didn't care at all.


Edit two: I'll try to talk to the professor, but I don't know if he'll be able to do much. Maybe M forgetting about his meds was a one time thing.",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-09-06,"AITA for complaining about an autistic guy I [18F] am an engineering student, and today I had multiple quizzes.
