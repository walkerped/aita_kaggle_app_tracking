0,1fa590p,AITA for pretending to be married to my bestfriend when I have a girlfriend?,"So for context I (25f) have worked a starbucks job for too long (eight months), and moved in with my girlfriend (28F) last year after knowing each other since high school, started dating two years ago. Anyway, I have a bestfriend since highschool (26f) who I'm just gonna call Will here. We always used to joke around and have fun, I didn't realize I was trans until I was 20 so we were normal guy friends until that, after that we're mostly the same but more over the top

Will comes into the store I work at pretty regularly and we'd joke around and stuff if there weren't a lot of people around. Eventually one of my coworkers asked if we were dating and I (forgetting they didn't know I was a lesbian and thinking they were joking) said ""oh year we got married last week, didn't I tell you?"". I didn't realize the mistake until later when I was leaving and they told me to say hi to him

That night we all hung out and I told them, we all thought it was funny and I forgot about it. A couple days later Will came in for coffee and my coworker got happy and said ""your husbands here"" and ran with it and got over the top sweet with petnames and compliments because it was both funny to us. I thought she'd catch on we were too sweet to be real, Will will follow any joke I start, she did not catch on

That started a six month game with me and Will where for the first couple months we just kept acting sweet and pretending we were making plans, just thinking it was a funny silly thing. After a while Will and I started coordinating in our free time, coming up with potentially over the top things and stories about what we did, and then for like the last three months we've been pretending to have regular fights over increasingly petty and absurd things. It kept me looking forward to work and it never got much farther than some fake flirting and hugs and a couple forehead kisses

Recently one of my coworkers apparently saw us on a date and pulled my girlfriend aside while I was in the bathroom and said ""hey just so you know she has a husband""

My girlfriend knew I was gay and living with her, so she was confused as fuck about this, asked me about it on the way home, I explained and she got a little confused at it. We ended up calling Will because it was still in the ""sort of funny this happened"" phase, and we talked about it and she seemed to think it was funny until Will asked if we should incorporate this into our game

She asked what we meant, and I explained we'd not only failed to correct my coworker's assumption and kept it up as a joke but also done the whole ""making up stories about our relationship and acting loveydovey"" thing. She got really mad at this and said it was gross and weird to do that, and it was a fucked up thing to do to my coworker. She also took a lot of issue with the fact we'd been hugging and (forehead) kissing as a joke, and said she’d have liked to at least know about that",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-09-06,"AITA for pretending to be married to my bestfriend when I have a girlfriend?

1,1fa55w2,AITA for complaining about an autistic guy,"I [18F] am an engineering student, and today I had multiple quizzes. I was kind of stressed already, but I became even more frustrated when an autistic guy [18M]  in my math class interrupted our quiz. Let's call him ""M."" For context, M is kind of weird. I don't really interact with him much. He brags about having autism, talks constantly over our professor, and he also got offended because nobody gave him any compliments on the trans pin on his backpack. 

I don't care what M does in his own free time, but I was already annoyed about him talking over the professor. Today, he decided to interrupt our math quiz which pissed me off even more. During the middle of the quiz, M suddenly stood up. He started talking super loud and saying that he ""has to take his ADHD medication at this time."" 

My main issue is how loud he was talking. He also didn't even approach our professor to tell him this. M just started talking while he was still standing by his seat. The professor ended up having to pull him out of class. I don't understand why M wouldn't just walk up to our professor and whisper instead of doing this. Our professor even told us what time the quiz would be. M could easily have told him this at the beginning of the quiz or right before it. 

As soon as M started complaining about having to take his meds, I could not focus anymore. And this quiz was especially important. For this class, we only have five quizzes and three exams. We aren't graded on anything else. I think I did okay on the quiz regardless of M interrupting, but I'm still really annoyed. 

M is in college so he's probably moderate or high functioning. I kinda feel like he should know better. I was complaining about M today to my friend on the phone. I was in my room during the call, and my roommate overheard me when she came in. She called me ""cruel"" and told me I should have sympathy for M. I don't have a problem with M himself, I just want him to stop interrupting class. 


Edit: I forgot to mention, but M didn't even apologize for interrupting the quiz. He just didn't care at all.

2,1fat3du,AITA for calling the non emergency services on my neighbor who I was worried about?,"I’ll try to make this as short as possible while providing enough context. She is early 20s just a couple years younger than me, and she lives directly across the hall from me. We aren’t like friends but definitely very friendly with each other as we see each other pretty frequently due to our schedules. I see her a lot of mornings taking out dogs out or going to work, and a lot of evenings coming home and doing the same thing. We always speak, and we have each others numbers.

Last Thursday I saw her and she said she wasn’t feeling good and I told her to let me know if she needs anything to let me know. When I was going out that night I walked past her door and it was slightly opened and I thought it was weird but didn’t think much of it at this point. Then when I came back an hour or two later there was a DoorDash pizza sitting outside her door but the door was closed. The next morning it was still there and I heard her dog barking but hadn’t seen her and thought it was really weird. Saturday I didn’t hear her dog barking but the pizza was still there and that evening I saw someone I’ve maybe seen her with once or twice trying to get into her apartment but the code was wrong.

I texted her after that and no response. I told my girlfriend if it was still there Monday morning I would go to the leasing office and it was. They said they couldn’t do much and to call the police if I thought it was an emergency but thought that might be an overreaction so I called non emergency. This ended up becoming conflated and they actually ended up breaking the lock on her door and it turns out she wasn’t there. 

This week she came back and needless to say was very confused and understandably upset that they put tape over her front door and broke her lock etc. she ended up telling me about it when I saw her yesterday and she was pretty pissed about it before I told her it was me but basically saying she was at a bachelorette party out of town and she ordered the pizza to the wrong address. The guy was a friend of hers and he was getting her dog to dog sit. I told my girlfriend and she told me this is why I should have minded my business and that I blew this out of proportion.

3,1fasynz,AITA for telling my son’s preschool teachers that they need to be focused on their students and not their friend’s baby and for emailing the director?,"My son (4) goes to a private preschool full time. They have 14 kids and 2 teachers in his class. 

Yesterday I went to pick him up and I saw one of his teachers holding a baby, maybe 9 months old. She was playing with the baby while all of the other kids played on the floor and the other teacher wiped down the tables. Nobody was interacting with the kids that were paying to be there. 

When the teacher noticed me she put the baby in her stroller so she could give me my son’s stuff then went back to holding the baby while talking to me. I asked whose baby that is and the teacher explained that she’s one of my son’s former teacher’s baby and that she had to take care of an emergency so they’re watching the baby until she gets back since my son’s class has the least amount of kids and older kids that know to be gentle around a baby. 

I told the teacher it wasn’t fair to the kids to have to change their behavior to accommodate a random baby in the class or for them to get no teacher interaction because their friend decided to leave her baby with them and that their job is to watch their students, not their friend’s baby. I took my son and let him stay at the playground so we could see how long it took for that teacher to get her kid and she didn’t leave for at least another 30 minutes, so the baby was in my son’s class for at least 45. 

I decided to email the director about the baby in my son’s class and how her being there took away from the kids in the class but all I got was a dismissive email saying that she’s sorry I wasn’t okay with it but that teacher got caught up with an emergency on campus and that my son’s room was the safest place for the baby. She also felt the need to remind me that this was during independent play, where there generally isn’t much teacher interaction or instruction. 

My son’s teachers were short with me this morning and my husband thinks I shouldn’t have emailed the director or confronted the teachers. He ended up doing pick up this afternoon because of everything.

4,1fasy4e,AITA for calling out a “harmless” volunteer?   ,"I work in a hospital as a PT. One of the units I cover has nursing students on Fridays. The hospital has volunteers, some of which see patients for prayer if the patient/family requests it. 

I was walking down the hall today after grabbing something for a patient. Two nursing students were in the hall talking to one of the volunteers. I found out today that he has multiple family members with a medical background or who have worked at the hospital. As I walked by, I caught a snippet of conversation between them, and I heard the words “marriage” and “sex”. The girls looked visibly uncomfortable. I didn’t stop immediately since I needed to drop something off for the patient, however by the time I left the patient’s room a few minutes later, the nursing students and volunteer were gone.

I ran into the students in a supply room a few minutes after. I asked them what the conversation entailed. They mentioned that he came up to them while they were reviewing some patient information. He started talking about how great the nursing profession is and that they should try to focus on their careers before marriage. Then, he started making comments about marriage itself, and said that while sex is great, marriage is more than sex. Apparently he also made some comments about Adam and Eve and God‘s plan for marriage, although I didn’t get the exact details of this. The girls said it seemed innocent, but was also a little strange that he would come up and talk to them out of the blue without knowing them or their religion. They also thanked me for checking and looking out for them. 

I personally thought this was wildly inappropriate and told my boss. She agreed, however made some comments that she is familiar with the volunteer and thinks he has some cognitive deficits. She asked me to inform the nursing student supervisor and the manager of that nursing unit. When I spoke with the manager, she said she would reach out to volunteer services to talk to someone about “giving him a reminder”. She also stated that he is harmless. It honestly felt like she was blowing me off. 

To me, even if there was no ill intent, that is not a “harmless” conversation that should be had with anyone: staff, students, or patients. I spoke to some other coworkers about it, and one said I did the right thing and that it was gross behavior on his part, while another also felt like it wasn’t a big deal and that he didn’t mean anything by it. I am second-guessing my response, but I still think it is so wrong for someone to be bringing up sensitive and personal topics such as religion and sex completely unbidden. Even if he does have cognitive deficits or dementia, this should be considered before allowing him to speak to patients and staff.

5,1fasq68,AITA Close Call Driving Home,"Today I (26F) was driving home from school on the back roads when I came across a Jeep Wrangler with its hazards on going noticeably below the speed limit. For context, I live in Ohio and when there’s no speed limit posted, the assumed speed limit is 55 mph. Because they were going so slow, I slowed down and went left of center to go around them. As i’m going around, this guy starts to turn left into a driveway, nearly hitting me. I swerved out of the way, but hit the part of the road where it met the driveway, causing the chrome piece that surrounds my headlight to pop off of my car and fly into the road behind me. 

I thought about continuing on and taking the L, but ultimately decided to turn around and take the drive of shame to collect my headlight cover. 

When I get back to the scene, I see the man who was driving the jeep walking back to his vehicle with my headlight cover IN HIS HAND. I pull over, turn on my hazards and got out to talk to him. 

I live in the country, and was nervous to approach this stranger, so I decided to try to be as nice as possible saying, “I’m so sorry, when I saw your hazards on I thought you were stopping and would have time to get around you.” He replied, seemingly angry, “You’re not supposed to pass on a double yellow line!” 

In Ohio this is true, except if: 
1. The slower car is going less than half the posted speed limit. 
2. The faster car is able to pass safely without speeding, and 
3. There is a clear view of oncoming traffic coming from the opposite way. 

All of these were true in my situation. He was turning in a Wrangler, so I assume he was going ~10-15 mph and I was going ~40 mph in a 55 mph zone. Instead of arguing with him, I just said okay and proceeded to ask him for my headlight cover because he was still holding it in his hand. He handed it back to me, still looking upset, I said thank you, and then turned to go back to my car. 

He yelled after me, “You need to be more careful when you’re driving, you could’ve KILLED me.” I replied that he should use his turning signal when he’s turning, rather than his hazard lights and hurried away, not wanting to discuss the subject any further. 

Am I the asshole??? I didn’t break any laws, but the situation did shake me up a little and I feel bad that he was so upset. I’m sure it was scary for both of us.

6,1fasnem,AITA for making my dad stop trying to hug me in a concert?,"This happened a couple of years ago, but I'm still thinking about it. 

There was this rock fair and I (16F) went with my best friend (17F) and my parents. So, for a little context, I was wearing a skirt and there was a lot of drunk people at that place. For the first couple hours my friend and I were catcalled more than three times which was, at first funny, but then it became kind of scary. The best bands played late at night, and more people started arriving. We went to grab some snacks, and when we went back, the amount of people was huge. As dumb as it sounds, we tried to get as close as possible to the stage, but then, in all that chaos, I felt someone touching my back. I couldn't do anything because the rest of the people didn't move at all. My dad moved that man away, and I managed to get out of that situation, then I tried to act as if nothing was wrong. 
Side note, my dad is not the best at showing affection, he doesn't like physical affection either, but at least he tries.
Again, he tried to express his affection to me in the worst moment possible and in the worst way possible. He grabbed my waist while we were listening to one of the bands I like. In general, I was extremely overstimulated, paranoic, anxious and at the verge of tears, so I took his hand out of my waist and moved away. He then tried to hug me like that again and I looked at him with a look of discomfort. My mom then noticed and told me I was being disrespectful. I told her what happened, and that I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings or anything but I didn't want anyone to touch me at that moment. She told me that what happened was not a reason nor a excuse for me to do that because he just wanted to hug me and spend a good time. I know that my dad didn't mean to make me feel uncomfortable or anything, but he wasn't respecting my boundaries, so I didn't want to apologize.

There was this rock fair and I (16F) went with my best friend (17F) and my parents. So, for a little context, I was wearing a skirt and there was a lot of drunk people at that place. For the first couple hours my friend and I were catcalled more than three times which was, at first funny, but then it became kind of scary. The best bands played late at night, and more people started arriving. We went to grab some snacks, and when we went back, the amount of people was huge. As dumb as it sounds, we tried to get as close as possible to the stage, but then, in all that chaos, I felt someone touching my back. I couldn't do anything because the rest of the people didn't move at all. My dad moved that man away, and I managed to get out of that situation, then I tried to act as if nothing was wrong. 
Side note, my dad is not the best at showing affection, he doesn't like physical affection either, but at least he tries.
Again, he tried to express his affection to me in the worst moment possible and in the worst way possible. He grabbed my waist while we were listening to one of the bands I like. In general, I was extremely overstimulated, paranoic, anxious and at the verge of tears, so I took his hand out of my waist and moved away. He then tried to hug me like that again and I looked at him with a look of discomfort. My mom then noticed and told me I was being disrespectful. I told her what happened, and that I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings or anything but I didn't want anyone to touch me at that moment. She told me that what happened was not a reason nor a excuse for me to do that because he just wanted to hug me and spend a good time. I know that my dad didn't mean to make me feel uncomfortable or anything, but he wasn't respecting my boundaries, so I didn't want to apologize. At the end I did give him an apology, but I still wonder if I am the Asshole for doing that. ",4.0,0.0106710121035575,0,0
7,1fasgwo,AITA for leaving someone naked outside for a little bit? ,"I 18m had a house party mostly in the garden  and have a hot tub at the house. Most people brought a change for it but this one guy didn’t. 

When we were done with it later on a bit he was dared to get in. So he asks us to looks away and strips off (no neighbours it’s fine live  in the country) and hops in. I thought it would be funny to move his clothes and towel to the garage to hide them for when he got out. 

But I had to go inside to sort something for like 25 minutes just like that’s all the time it was and kinda forgot I did that. And he got out, which I think was pretty sickly because I turned it off fully earlier because I didn’t think anyone else was gonna use it again and you know costs money to run with electricity, so he was kinda just chilling in some cold-lukewarm at best water. So when he got out he couldn’t find his clothes and towel obviously and only I knew where they were so he was kinda standing with his hands covering his cock and balls. 

Which I think would have actually been fine but the others, which included a couple girls decided it wouldn’t be fair for him to miss out on the conversation due to these circumstances so they all kinda crowded around him because it was funny. (There was a lot of alcohol involved) even tho he told them to stop 

Someone told him they knew I moved the stuff but didn’t know where then when I got back I obviously got it for him and everything was fine but he got like REALLY mad at just me. 

The thing is tho he’s not fat or anything he’s pretty fit and idk if anyone seen his dick or what but I wasn’t apart of the group deciding to just chat to him like he wasn’t completely naked. Also if it was such an issue why not get back in? Part of me thinks he kinda liked it but wanted to seem like he didn’t but obviously I can’t prove that. Especially because one of the girls was flirting with him, he was fine. End of the day it wasn’t that bad imo. ",Asshole,2024-09-06,"AITA for leaving someone naked outside for a little bit?

I (f19) and my brother (m16) each got a car when we were 16. the difference, though, is that I got a car from 1998. my brother, on the other hand, got a car from 2022.

originally, my dad was going to give my brother the old family car (I believe it was a 2015). instead, my dad traded in the family car for a new 2022 car. when he did this, he told my brother that I'd get to use it when I needed to because my car shouldn't drive further than 30 minutes away. my car currently has over 263,000 miles on it.

obviously I was upset that my brother got a new car and I got shit. my dad bought my car when I was 14, so I didn't understand just how screwed I'd be by the time I was an adult. it's broken down more times than I can count.

my brother gets upset every time I tell him I need his car. he doesn't like driving mine because it doesn't drive well, and he doesn't like that my gas mileage is shit compared to his. my dad always makes him give it up when I need it, though.

so, in october I'm going to need his car for a 3 day trip. it's 10 hours away and it's for a friend's birthday. I told him today that I was going to need his car, and immediately he started arguing about it. despite what he agreed to with my dad when he got the car, he believes I need to ask when I need to use it, not just tell him.

I don't ask because I know he doesn't get a say. he says it wasn't his choice to get a 2022 car, so he shouldn't have to suffer driving my shit car for 3 days. he says he's mainly upset that I don't ask for his car, I just tell him I need it.

   A few years ago his mom and I divorced, things just stopped working out. There was no animosity that I noticed. We all stayed in closed contact,shared some time together and even helped purchase a truck for my son. As things progressed my time with my son was becoming less and less. I attributed it to his work schedule and other commitments. Slowly our social media interactions have become just a thumbs up to a message.

    Last week told his mom out of frustration that I’m gonna stop paying for his truck. It was a gift so he had reliable transportation for work but in 7 months that truck has not found its way to myself and my family and his sick grandpa. 
  
    Am I the asshole for taking back a gift? I he just being an immature youth or is he washing his hands of us?


Update … Sorry let me clarify. He has had the truck almost 2 years now. I had originally hoped he would assume the loan after getting acclimated to his job and schedule. And yes I have talked to him multiple times as to the severity of my father’s condition. I don’t know how to sugar coat, touch and go” or “30% success rate” but he was definitely made aware of the situation ",1.0,1.055646538734436,1,1
17,1faqg7c,WIBTA for not attending my sister's wedding dinner?,"Hello Reddit.

My sister, 22f, is marrying her fiance, late 30s m, at the end of this month. The wedding is in his country, and most of us siblings can't make it, due to finances, not having a passport, or not being able to take time off work due to the severely short notice. Because of this, my sister and my mom planned a family dinner that will happen at my parents house in their town, where most of the siblings live. 

To be blunt, I 20f, do not want to go. Me and my sister have had a strained relationship since she started dating her fiance. She met him online, and they texted and video called for months before meeting in person. He's a decent guy, however, my sister lied about almost everything about him. She lied about how they met, how long they were talking, his age, among other things. She also left my brother in laws funeral early to fly out and meet him for the first time, a thing that hurt alot of us. She told everyone that she was flying to meet him in a large city a few hours away, when in reality, she flew to his country instead and told no one until later.

However, that's not the reason I don't want to go. A couple months ago, I received earth shattering news that left me a complete mess. It wasn't something I could talk to my parents about, for various reasons, so I reached out to my oldest sister. She encouraged me to talk to the family about it, so I contacted the sister getting married. We had been very close as children and i used to go to her for help with issues often. I told her what was going on and she blew up at me. She called me terrible and horrid and said that I was just like our mom, who I have a very strained relationship with, due to her political and religous views (very conservative Christian and a conspiracy theorist). She finished by saying not to crawl to her later because she would not support me or help me. Because of her response, I didn't contact any other family. I went through the worst time of my life almost completely alone. She then acted like none of it ever happened, and that our relationship was just like it was before. I limited contact. I'm polite when I see her and I'll text her back if she texts me, but I don't tell her personal things and I'm not ever the one to initiate conversations.

Her wedding dinner is in two weeks. My brother and his family are not attending for their own reasons, and I really just don't want to go. I'd have to take time off work and school, and arrange travel to my parents town. It's a big hassle for someone I don't have a good relationship with. Everytime i see her, i remember how hurt and alone i felt. My mom says that we are family and need to support her, so I have to go.

She started distancing herself from me, never being able to hang out or even text or call. Whenever I asked if she was free, she would say she was hanging out with Jack. I started to get annoyed at this, and avoided her the same way. Not like that did much. This behavior kept getting worse as they started going on more dates, and spend more time together.

19,1fapoat,AITA for telling my mom the speech she wants me to make to my stepdad is not happening like she wants?,"My dad died suddenly when I (28f) was 7. My parents were in the middle of their divorce at the time. My mom was already dating my stepdad. But they broke up 2 months after my dad died because he was introduced to me and I had the biggest fit ever. It was so out of character for me that family stepped in and told mom she needed to focus on me and my stepdad was hurt that everyone was so against them, so they broke up. They got back together when I was 10 and married when I was 13. By the time they got back together he decided he was going to prove that he could be a great ""dad"" to me and he devoted a lot of time to getting close to me, and I liked him a lot, but I never let him be my new ""dad"". This hurts him deeply. But my mom is bothered by it more. When I was 14 she told me all the shitty things my dad had done to her (while also admitting she did shitty things to him) and she asked me if that was really the man I wanted to idealize and pine after instead of accepting a wonderful man who was willing to give us a second chance after the incident the first time. I told my mom that dad could be a shitty husband to her, like she was a shitty wife to him. But they were still my parents and nobody could compare.

I do have a positive relationship with my stepdad. But I would not say I love him as strongly as my parents. When I started planning my wedding earlier this year I asked him to escort my mom down the aisle and asked him if he wanted to pick a special pose for us for a photo of just the two of us. He accepted but then asked me about walking me down the aisle and performing a dance with me. I told him I was walking with my fiancée because she and I decided we'd like to walk together and we weren't doing any special dances other than our first dance. He scolded me like a kid for not giving him a more traditional role. During his disappointed period he told my mom and she told me I should make a speech to him during the wedding. Then she handed me this one she prepared that thanked him for being an amazing dad, that I couldn't have asked for a better second dad, and heavily, heavily leaned into the whole idea of him being my dad. It even called him the most important man in my life.

I told her I could include him in the toast but the speech was not happening like she wanted. She told me this would make him feel way better. I told her I won't stand there and lie. I told her I do not see him as my dad. She told me I should. That he deserves it. Then she told me I was being a brat.

I moved out of my parents house 2 months ago to move in with my partner who I’ve been with for 4 years. I’ve enjoyed not only living with him and taking such a step in our relationship but also having the freedom from my somewhat strict parents.

I (M, 23) want to ban my fiancé (M, 26) from helping his friend move after work, because I only get two hours with him a day. Unfortunately, my job that requires I work from 3:45 AM to 11:30 AM, does not align with his 10 AM to 7 PM schedule. I usually get ready for bed around 9 PM. During that 2 hour gap, me and him will just chill out in the living room doing our own things, but enjoying each other’s company nonetheless (we’re both home bodies so this works out for the both of us). However, he texts me to say that his friend that he goes out to see around 9 PM. Every. Single. Day. Is needing help to move, but he’d have to go immediately after work. I expressed that I’d be disappointed with this decision with a lighthearted “Awww. Boooo! Lol” as to not worry him too much for now, but I’m actually upset. So would I be the a-hole if I firmly stated that he shouldn’t help with the move and come straight home after work? 

For clarification I don’t mind him spending time with his friend after 9, but I don’t want him to go out right after work.

Edit: Woah… I did not expect so many people to be so aggressive in the comments. I haven’t banned him and I definitely don’t plan to anymore.

22,1fap3lv,AITA for refusing to see my friends past certain hour and holding strong to my boundaries?,"I (M21) have a group of friends who like to drink and hang out late into the night, sometimes until 3 until the morning.

Firstly, I strongly dislike being out past, say 9:30 (yes,I know that this is uncharacteristic of me at this age, I often get called an old man, I don’t care). This is for several reasons such as my health deteriorating rapidly from lost sleep and having responsibilities that need my attention in the morning (school, work, etc.)

Secondly, I am on a path towards remaining entirely sober. Also largely for health reasons. Many people I know slam drinks every day and have been doing so for years and are entirely fine. I hate the way being drunk makes me feel and I hate drinking altogether, etc. etc.

The issue arises when this is all my friends want to do.

I wasn't too excited about it because I’ve never heard of it so I didn’t know what to expect, but I went along to hang out with everyone.

When we got there, I looked at the menu and didn't see much that appealed to me. I ended up ordering a small appetizer and a milkshake, while everyone else ordered full meals. When the food came, I didn't really like what I had ordered, but I ate it anyway because I was really hungry. Also the food was very overpriced. The milkshake was about $8 while the fries were $6 so the total of what I ordered was $14.

When the bill came, it was pretty high since everyone else had ordered a lot of food. One of my friends said we should split the bill evenly, but I didn't think that was fair since I had only ordered a small appetizer and a drink. I said I would just pay for my own food, while everyone else's meals were much more expensive.

Some of my friends were okay with it, but a couple of them including Alex got annoyed. They said it was easier to just split the bill evenly and that I was being difficult. I explained that I didn't choose the restaurant, didn't order much, and didn't even like the food, so I didn't think it was fair to pay more than what I owed. We ended up having to stay an extra 15 min because I had a card and no cash and they had to go to the register and have me pay only a certain amount. There was a lot of people there so it took time. I was told we should have just split because now we wasted time but I still waited and paid my $14. 

Now I'm wondering if I was being unreasonable because it was faster to just split the bill. I know that a lot of friend groups split bills so I’m wondering if I was just selfish? I just didn’t want to have to play an extra $10 for no reason. AITA?

Edit: 
-not sure why it’s relevant but I paid tax & tip.
 
-Now a lot of people mentioned cash. I normally pay with cash but I forgot to bring it that night, my mistake. So I couldn’t just throw cash down I had to use the card

Now I'm wondering if I was being unreasonable because it was faster to just split the bill. I know that a lot of friend groups split bills so I’m wondering if I was just selfish? I just didn’t want to have to play an extra $10 for no reason. AITA?

Edit: 
-not sure why it’s relevant but I paid tax & tip.
 
-Now a lot of people mentioned cash. I normally pay with cash but I forgot to bring it that night, my mistake. So I couldn’t just throw cash down I had to use the card

-I never verbalized how I felt throughout the night because I didn’t want to ruin the night. It was still fun to laugh with my friends ",0.0,0.9667266011238098,1,0

I do everything she asks me to do and it never seems like enough, my stepdad said I’m an awful scum of a person for yelling at my mom like that, but their putting so much pressure on me and I can only do so many things at once, they expect me to do college level of work at only 15 and if I don’t do “good” which is only all A’s then I’ll get in trouble.

28,1fanqwf,AITA: for blowing up at my MIL at a family dinner ,"Throwaway account since my husband is an active Reddit user.

I (23F) have been married to my husband (24M) for three years. We were high school sweethearts and have been best friends since elementary school. He’s still my best friend to this day.

I’ve never had a great relationship with his mom; she’s difficult to talk to, and our conversations are usually very shallow (gossiping about neighbors, complaining about the landscapers, etc.).

Almost a year ago, my mom passed away, which still feels surreal to write. She truly was my soulmate, and I’m incredibly grateful to have had her in my life for 23 years. I miss her more than words can describe. My husband's family really stepped up during that time, supporting us financially with funeral costs and managing affairs when I was deep in grief. I’m genuinely grateful for their help.

Fast forward to now—we're expecting our first baby. As excited as I am, I’m also deeply saddened that my mom won’t be here to guide me through this. We always talked about what my kids would call her (we had settled on “Grams”).

Now, to the incident:  
We were celebrating our pregnancy at a dinner with my in-laws, and my mother-in-law asked to make a toast. She laughed and said, “I’m so grateful to celebrate a new addition to our family. We can't wait to meet little ‘Veronica’” (which is her name).

She went on to talk about her own pregnancy and what I should expect, mentioning that my husband had an abnormally big head when he was born. Then she said, “I look forward to being the favorite grandma to ‘Veronica,’ since of course, I’ll be the only grandma.”

The room went silent, and I started to cry. I stood up and told her how incredibly insensitive it was to say that, and that my mom would always be a grandmother, whether she’s here or not.

She responded by saying I was ""overreacting"" and that it was just a joke. I told her to go to hell and left immediately.

My husband later called me, saying he spoke to his mom, who was in tears because she was embarrassed. She asked him to apologize on her behalf, and he told me I should have come back instead of telling her to go to hell and storming off.

I’m currently staying with my sister and haven't stopped crying since. She supports me 100%, but I really want to know: Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-06,"AITA: for blowing up at my MIL at a family dinner  Throwaway account since my husband is an active Reddit user.

We’ve jumped through so many hoops with social services and being assessed to have full time care of him as they said she abandoned him. I even gave up work to look after him because I wasn’t entitled to any sort of paid leave as I’m not his parent. We found out a few months after she left him she’d gone back to his dad and got pregnant about a month after she left. We were asked if the baby was taken from her when born if we would be able to have it. We categorically said we couldn’t have anymore kids as 1. Our house isn’t big enough 2. He wouldn’t even be one when she had the next baby and 3. I have health issues that are manageable looking after one baby but throw another one in it wouldn’t be. Jump to last night when she accused us of keeping her son away from her. We’re not but social services have said that she can only see him once a week throughout the duration of the court case and then their recommendation is once a month. We’ve agreed to this but also said that if and this is a big if she gets her mental health, housing and money issues under control we are not going to stop her seeing him more than once a month. Im not one for sugarcoating things so she knows I will tell her straight and told her she needs to understand how much we’ve given up to raise her son to keep him out of the system (me and my husband don’t have our own kids and pretty much had the freedom to do what we wanted). She then said he’s her son and she’ll do what she likes to which we told her she can’t as we will have the overriding parental rights. We told her she chose to leave him and go back to his dad and it’s something she’s going to have to live with.

When i found out i was pregnant i told him that i wanted to get married and that it was important to me to have the same last name as my child. He kept putting it off and i finally told him i would stop asking and that he knew what i wanted and the ball was in his court now. Fast forward 6 months later, Right before i had my daughter i confronted him about it again and he stated that he never acted on marriage because he just simply had not had the time away from work. He owns his own business and does work long hours. This hurt my feelings because it felt like he was prioritizing his job over me. I had our daughter and due to pressure from him i gave her his last name. I regret this deeply now. We still haven’t gotten married and this has become a sore subject for us. Every-time the conversation is brought up i get very angry and want to call the whole relationship off. I feel like he doesn’t want to marry me and that my wants and desires are not important to him. He still has not made any moves to actually get married but swears up and down that he wants to.

31,1fanblr,AITA for pointing out to my mother that the reason I don't have a lot of pictures is because of the comments she made about my smile?,"I (25F) and my husband, Jake (25M), got married a few days ago and just came back from our honeymoon the day before yesterday. I'm very close with my parents even today and they're probably the reason I've been able to achieve a lot of things and I often express my gratitude regarding that. 

Today, we went to visit my parents because they had been insisting we should have a dinner together now that we're officially family. I'm an only child and none of my grandparents are there any more so it was just me, Jake,  mom and dad. After dinner, we were checking out the picture albums my parents had. Some of them were pictures of my parents when they were younger, me when I was younger and loads of pictures of the vacations we took (my dad had a camera and he loved using it). 

Jack noticed that the album only had 3-4 pictures of me smiling after I reached my teenage years and commented on that asking me why I didn't smile for pictures. (I met Jack when we were 19 and at that point, I had already gotten therapy because of bullying in school and other stuff, I was a lot better and therefore, I didn't talk too much about the previous stuff, even if I did, everything that happened with my parents were pretty small to what I faced at school so I never mentioned it or it just never stood out to me.)

He then went on to explain how much he loves my smile and my two big teeth (the two front teeth that you can see). He often commented that I looked like I bunny when I smiled and it was almost healing for me. 

I then mentioned that when I was 12, one of my mother's friends made a comment about how I smile so wide, showing all of my teeth and it wasn't pretty, just disgusting and my mother relayed it to me without adding anything else (she made no comments of agreeing or disagreeing). I said that I remembered it throughout my teenage years and the bullying just made it worse so I was always afraid of showing my teeth when I smiled and so, I never smiled in general. 

To be honest, I don't think much of it anymore. I only really care about what Jack thinks and he only has positive things to say about me (at one point, I wanted to get a dental procedure done but after I started therapy, I just decided not to). The remark wasn't supposed to highlight my mother as the ""bad guy"" but it seems like that's what it did. Mom and dad were both there and heard it. My mom got pretty angry at me for ""making something like that up"". I told her that it was true but she said she didn't remember. It's only understandable that I remember, given how big of an impact it had on me but I'm afraid I hurt my mother. We're really close and I don't want to strain out relationship.

He then went on to explain how much he loves my smile and my two big teeth (the two front teeth that you can see). He often commented that I looked like I bunny when I smiled and it was almost healing for me. 

I then mentioned that when I was 12, one of my mother's friends made a comment about how I smile so wide, showing all of my teeth and it wasn't pretty, just disgusting and my mother relayed it to me without adding anything else (she made no comments of agreeing or disagreeing). I said that I remembered it throughout my teenage years and the bullying just made it worse so I was always afraid of showing my teeth when I smiled and so, I never smiled in general. 

To be honest, I don't think much of it anymore. I only really care about what Jack thinks and he only has positive things to say about me (at one point, I wanted to get a dental procedure done but after I started therapy, I just decided not to). The remark wasn't supposed to highlight my mother as the ""bad guy"" but it seems like that's what it did. Mom and dad were both there and heard it. My mom got pretty angry at me for ""making something like that up"". I told her that it was true but she said she didn't remember. It's only understandable that I remember, given how big of an impact it had on me but I'm afraid I hurt my mother. We're really close and I don't want to strain out relationship. My dad is going back and forth on who's wrong, who's right so here I am to get my verdict.",0.0,-0.0053729945793747,0,1

I believe that food should be eaten in the order from ""about to go bad"" to ""will stay good for years"". So if something is sitting in the fridge, I think that should be the next thing to be eaten, not the canned stuff in the cupboard.

My family does not believe in this system. They eat purely based on their desires, and will ignore leftovers, fresh food and fresh baked goods in favour of either packaged, canned or frozen foods, or simply foods that still have a long life to look forward to, just because they fancy to eat them in the moment.

This really bothers me, but every time I try to talk about it they call me annoying and restricting. There's two things that make me feel bad: the fact that food expires due to this behaviour (more important), and that my food gets overlooked and ignored (less important). I'm all about food freedom, and we don't experience food insecurity, but does it really not matter as much as I think?

He’s a bartender in a popular beach town on the west coast USA, and insists that he needs to go out drinking there once a week for the politics of his job. 

Two weeks ago, he went out drinking with our friend group and I stayed home because my mom was visiting. My friend texted me “Two girls tried flirting with Austin and he mentioned you so quickly”, which I was proud of. I asked for more details and she told me that they were hellbent on finding a “boyfriend” in our city because they live in the Midwest and like visiting out here. They were talking to the friend group, asking my friend to set them up with someone. She pointed out one of our single friends but that didn’t go anywhere and the girls eventually had an isolated conversation with my boyfriend. 

I found out yesterday that Austin (and two other friends present that night) exchanged Instagram follows with one of the Midwest girls. I told Austin that I don’t think it’s appropriate for someone in a relationship to be exchanging contact information with girls from the bar. He got very defensive and told me that the girl likes the bar he works at, and said she wanted to come back in with her friends. She doesn’t need his Instagram to go to the bar, the bar is busy enough without her patronage, and I don’t think upsetting me is worth a $10 tip.

The whole time they were dating, engaged and early in marriage, they told everyone she could never have a baby because she had a complete hysterectomy (various and changing reasons for the surgery, including appendicitis and cancer). When her daughter started having periods, she told me she had to run to the store to get products because she herself had not had a period in 10 years. So, last fall, after they had been separated for months, she calls to announce that she's pregnant. When I said I didn't believe it, she said the surgery had only been a cervix removal, not her uterus. My spouse and I were skeptical, but pretended to go along with it. My sib, neph's parent, announced the pregnancy to the extended family and everyone was skeptical because she had told everyone she had a hysterectomy. Making a long story short, they asked us for $150,000 to make a down payment on a new house for the baby. We didn't respond, mostly because they had grifted us in the past with claims that she needed to fly to FL to see her dying father, etc. As proof that she was pregnant, she sent us a sonogram image that was a photo from a book.

36,1fal0cy,AITA for calling my sister a little tone deaf?,"I made a post about this a while ago (now deleted) and was pretty much told I am unequivocably the asshole. But when I told my oldest sister about it she said I'm absolutely not the asshole. So now I'm confused 

Basically, what happened is I (youngest) was drinking with my sister (middle) and jokingly said she was a little tone deaf. She jokes about her singing from time to time and I didn't intend any offense just a lighthearted jab. The next day she mentions it hurt her feelings so I apologize (admitedly awkwardly because I'm bad with confrontation) a few days later I apologized again and she readily accepted it. Everything seemed fine.

Months pass and she said something that hurt my feelings and when I tried to tell her it hurt me she brought up how I said she was a little tone deaf. When I didn't immediately apologize she huffed and turned on the car radio to fill the silence unaware that I was silently crying. When she realized I was crying I told her that what she said is a trigger for me. I ended up apologizing for calling her tone deaf again (she said she forgot I apologized later but she has a tendency to conveniently forget when problems are resolved and just hold onto them) and I don't think she ever actually apologized to me.

What I said was shitty even if the hurt was unintentional. But I apologized three times and she didn't apologize once even after I said it hurt me. I think what I got was an ""I didn't know that..my bad."" I don't blame her for not knowing, the issue is bringing up something unrelated from the past in an attempt to shift the blame onto me.

This is something she has done with both my eldest sister and my mom in the past. We (middle and I) almost never fight so this is the first time she has ever done this to me. I have a tendency to blame myself before I blame others so the way I phrased my first post didn't mention this is a pattern for her. She has mostly grown out of it but not entirely. She has never had anything to hold over me like this and considering she already held onto it for months despite multiple apologies I worry it will show up again the next time I try to bring up an issue with her.

After the original post I was fully settled in the idea that I'm the asshole and started making a playlist of her favorite songs to sing on car rides as a fourth apology (which I'm still going to do regardless) but after talking to my oldest sister I don't think I deserved to have my feelings brushed off the way they were.

She reminded me that middle would hold onto things for years and bring them up arbitarily as a gotcha whenever they would argue. I'm not mad at middle, it just makes me sad that this might be the case.

During the last 6 months of our relationship I felt increasingly miserable because of her but tossed it up to I just wasn’t in the right head space due to other personal reasons. One of which was my mum who raised me as a single parent passing away from cancer. 

What I hadn’t realised at the time was that in our relationship I had been emotionally controlled and manipulated, losing time to myself, personal hobbies, time with other friends etc. all because she expected me to hold her as my number 1 in my life and drop everything for her. I never once yelled at her, I always put her first even before myself, I communicated clearly and I treated her like royalty. But all I got back was snarky comments like “you need to change your fashion sense,” “I could never be seen with you in public if you cut your hair a certain way.” Etc.

Once I realised I had no commitment to be in this relationship and gained free will, I broke it off quite suddenly with items of hers still at my place. It ended very badly with her saying some very nasty things about my own deceased mother while I just sat there in silence.

She had created these scrapbooks of memories and letters for us and she encouraged us to be a part of creating them. My brother was writing in his before he died but I mostly drew or maybe made some small notes. When mom died my brother wrote in both of ours and encouraged me to keep drawing/making notes and later writing. Dad never had much to do with them. He always said it was more of moms thing and he never was good with words, written or otherwise, which is true.

When I was 10 he remarried. His wife asked about the book a lot and she offered to take over the book for me (though not my brother because he was always rude to her). I said no. She asked multiple times. I told her no and that mom hadn't wanted dad's new wife to take over what she started. She was hurt when I told her and my dad suggested that I didn't need to say something like that to her and I should forget about what mom would have wanted. I told him I had already said no before and she kept asking. That it was true and he knew it. He said mom was selfish for that. That it put him in a bad place for remarrying.  I told him that wasn't my fault and I could understand why she wouldn't want her replacement to do it. He told me his wife wasn't a replacement and was special and important to us in her own right. I said she was acting like she was mom's replacement when she refused to take no for an answer. He asked me to see the positive instead of the negative.

A few days ago I came home from school early and my dad and his wife were home. She had my book out and was trying to think of something to write in it.

41,1fajsdd,AITA for bribing my little brother?,"I (22M) have 4 younger siblings: 20M, 19F, 17F, & 14M. My mom is currently planning a family vacation for winter break. My parents are divorced, and my mom has a boyfriend she's been with for almost 2 years.

In those 2 years, my mom has gone on vacation with her boyfriend a couple times, but all our family vacations have been without him. My mom asked my siblings and I if we would be willing to invite him on our vacation in December.

There's mixed feeling between my siblings about this. I like the guy and would enjoy him coming on vacation with us. However, my sisters specifically seem to have an issue with it. My mom gave us a few days to think about it and said we could vote on it.

Pre-vote I figured that it would only be me and my 20M brother voting in favor of the boyfriend coming on vacation. This was frustrating because my youngest 3 siblings didn't really have a good reason to why they didn't want him coming. 

This felt mean on a couple fronts. Firstly, our mom's boyfriend is a nice guy and has been nothing but kind to my siblings and me. He recently built my youngest sister a custom bookcase for her bedroom. Secondly, it's mean to our mom who does so much and has sacrificed so much for us. Why shouldn't she be able to go on vacation with all the people she loves.

I decided to convince my little brother to change his mind. I think he was mainly going to vote no because of his allegiance to our father. He's basically the only one of my siblings that still has a relationship with our dad and is always going out of his way to please him. 

He was easily bought. I told him if he voted for the boyfriend to come on vacation, I would buy him whatever PS5 game he wanted. 

We voted last weekend and as only my sisters voted against him my mom booked the vacation to include her boyfriend. 

However, when my mom asked my brother where he go the video game from, he told her about me buying it for him and why. She was mad and told my sisters about it.

This has sort of opened a moral dilemma within my family because at this point, we can't really uninvite the guy. But in my opinion if my brother's vote could be so easily bought, he didn't feel that strongly about it in the first place.

43,1faj57u,AITA I told my gf to stop trying to get in bed with me because I thought she was someone else ,"My gf and I are both college students and we’ve been dating for almost 1 1/2 years. We both are going to college but in different parts of the state and are 2.5 hours away from each other. We planed to go back to my hometown this weekend and she ended up not having class Thursday or Friday so she drove to the town I live in. (I live closer to my hometown and live in an apartment by myself). 
After we made supper and got ready for bed, she was talking to me about if there were any girls in my class that had talking to me. Here’s a little backstory of what this conversation between me and this girl was. She asked me if I still had my high school senior ID in my wallet still (we went to the same school) I told her yes I do, and me trying to be light hearted I joked that she was staring at my ass. She and her friend laughed and she said “I was actually thinking about how many $20 you have in your wallet so I could pay my internet bill.” I chuckled a little and then turned and walked away. 
That is what I told my gf and she got upset because “that’s how I used to flirt with guys” I don’t know if that’s a common way of flirting or what but I don’t think that she was flirting because she knows that I have a gf. I still had school in the morning so I was gonna go to sleep, and she left the bed and I thought it sounded like her going into the living room to sleep on the couch. In the morning I saw a text from her at 2AM reading

“I got up to go to the bathroom and you were laying across the bed, I tried getting back in bed and you said “stop it (girls name)”, so I’m sleeping on the couch and I really really really hope that’s just because we were talking about her before bed. I’ll try to be gone by the time you get home from your first class but I also haven’t slept yet so no promises.”

When I got home after my first class at 9AM she was still sleeping on the couch so I went to my room until I heard her move around. So I went out to the living room and sat on the recliner, I tried to make conversation and she looked at me like she was just done with me and payed down in my room.

46,1faikxc,AITA for telling my SIL the world doesn't revolve around her and her kids?,"I (F33) am a mother of two. The other day was my son's fifth birthday and my husband and I threw a party at our home

The party has caused a bit of a rift between me and my husband's twin sister, 'Eve' (F36). Eve and I don't have much in common and usually I only see her during holidays and special occasions. She and my husband are not particularly close either.

For context, Eve has three kids, ages 9, 5 and 2.

A few days before the party, Eve messaged me that she may not go because it will be during her youngest's nap time. I told her that her kid is more than welcome to sleep at our home and we can put her in our youngest's bed. Eve said she would think about it but that she probably will not come.

Eve didn't message me or my husband again so we assumed she was not coming but she did turn up on the day. Like 5 minutes after she arrived she asked if the bed was set up for her youngest and I explained we weren't expecting them so I'll need a few minutes to get it ready. Eve asked if we don't keep our kids' bedrooms tidy which really irritated me!

Eve's daughter slept fine. She did fuss a bit waking up but at least the nap time issue was solved.

She saw the cake we had for our son which was hidden in our kitchen so he wouldn't see it before it was time to blow out the candles. She said that her kids will not eat that kind of cake, it was lemon cake if that matters. I know that a lot of kids probably aren't keen on lemon cake but it's what my son likes. I told Eve that we did have some candy in our kitchen that her kids could have so they don't feel left out of having a treat.

They ended up leaving abruptly before we got the cake out and only said bye to my husband. They then came back with chocolate cupcakes from the corner shop (before we'd done cake and candles for my son, they were only gone for maybe 20-30 minutes) and started serving them to their kids. This caused some of the younger kids at the party to start fussing because they wanted the cupcakes too and there wasn't enough to go round.

Eve also repeatedly connected her phone to our bluetooth speakers to play music without asking us (when we already had music playing). I asked her to stop because it was just making the house sound like a mishmash of music and she said that I'm ""being a grump"".

I guess that was the straw that broke the camel's back for me and after the party I told her that the world doesn't revolve around her and her kids.

47,1faiixv,AITA for trying to give a guy advice about his relationship?,"

I 18f was hanging out with friends and one 18m very recently got his first girlfriend 

People where asking him questions and stuff and he mentioned she’s amazing and he can’t believe it and how excited he is and when he was holding her all he could think was holy shit omgomgomgomgomg like all giddy about it 

I just suggested he try and tone down those feelings a bit because personally it would give me a bit of an ick and even if he doesn’t think he expresses that too much he probably does come across a bit needy or too much if that’s what’s going on in his head. Comes across clingy and needy. 

Then also because someone asked him about sex he mentioned they did “stuff” and he’s nervous about eating her out because even tho he really wants to he doesn’t know what to do because he’s never done it before. 

I say if they were already doing “stuff” then why didn’t he try? (Seemed like he didn’t even ask) he shouldn’t let nerves stop him doing stuff in a relationship he should have more confidence in her, himself and the relationship itself. And that goes beyond sex I was speaking in general but using this as an example. It comes across that he lacks confidence. (Also he eventually because it was asked mentioned “stuff” included a blowjob so really actually don’t know why he didn’t do more than presumably use his hands? Just unrelated if he wanted to so much little confused on why he didn’t lol) 

Both instances of giving advice led to the group telling me off, asking me who the hell asked and to stop and be quiet and to stop trying to put him down which wasn’t what I was doing I was just trying to be helpful

I just suggested he try and tone down those feelings a bit because personally it would give me a bit of an ick and even if he doesn’t think he expresses that too much he probably does come across a bit needy or too much if that’s what’s going on in his head. Comes across clingy and needy. 

Then also because someone asked him about sex he mentioned they did “stuff” and he’s nervous about eating her out because even tho he really wants to he doesn’t know what to do because he’s never done it before. 

I say if they were already doing “stuff” then why didn’t he try? (Seemed like he didn’t even ask) he shouldn’t let nerves stop him doing stuff in a relationship he should have more confidence in her, himself and the relationship itself. And that goes beyond sex I was speaking in general but using this as an example. It comes across that he lacks confidence. (Also he eventually because it was asked mentioned “stuff” included a blowjob so really actually don’t know why he didn’t do more than presumably use his hands? Just unrelated if he wanted to so much little confused on why he didn’t lol) 

Both instances of giving advice led to the group telling me off, asking me who the hell asked and to stop and be quiet and to stop trying to put him down which wasn’t what I was doing I was just trying to be helpful 

Note: 
If you seen this the other day there was an issue with my account that caused an issue with the post and caused it to be removed before a proper discussion could happen which is now fixed ",1.0,1.06385600566864,1,1
48,1faif08,WIBTAH if I dropped out of my school performance against racism? ,"I'm a 15-year-old Black girl in high school. My class is preparing a performance of a song against racism, where a Black slave rebels against his owner. 

At first, I thought it was nice that we were doing something to commemorate the end of slavery, but seeing how my school and classmates have approached the topic, I’m starting to think it might have been better if they hadn’t done anything at all.

It all started when our social studies teacher proposed the performance to our class. A lot of the kids started joking that we were going to be slaves again. I didn’t find it funny, but I didn’t get mad until the teacher came up behind me, touched my hair while I was distracted, and said something along the lines of “We have the perfect one here.” I didn’t say anything to avoid making a scene, but it made me really uncomfortable, and since then, the jokes haven’t stopped during rehearsals.

One part of the group is going to dance, another will be “Spaniards,” and another will be “slaves.” The students and the teacher have been picking students with darker skin to play the slaves, often making mean-spirited jokes about it. I don’t want to cause problems, and everyone has said they want to participate, but now I’m realizing it’s going to be super humiliating to show up to school in a white tank top and chains.

 Plus, the teacher suggested that since we don’t have enough Black students, some of the white students should paint their skin black with make up because “it’s just a representation.”

There are other weird ideas for the day too, like everyone in the school wearing African braids because “we all have Afro heritage.” I also feel like the kids with Indigenous and islander heritage are being erased in all this.

I feel that I migth be over reacting given that I'm not even the one that is getting the short stick in this disaster. One of my partnerts, a girl with a darker skin who didn't want to join either was pressured into taking the main role as a black slave being lashed, and everybody has been making fun of her since. 

The teacher haven't stop the people making fun of her but instead has said that we ""shouldn't be ashamed of being black"". 

Would I be the asshole if I spoke up and said I didn’t want to participate?

I don't want to create a problem but I feel uncomfortable with the whole idea at this point. I migth as well just brush it off and try to have fun. 


Edit:

Thank u all for ur advice! I've read it all and will be taking it in account. I've talked to my parents and I will be talking to my teacher once we're back at school the tuesday, specifically about the black face issue. I think i migth as well have a talk with my school partnerts since we used to have a pretty good relationship before this all, and with the main role girl. I believe that if we talk together and then to the teacher, we migth think of a new propose that doesn't involve making anyone uncomfortable.

my father earns a lot more than my mother and doesn’t seem to have trouble with other expenses such as hiring a helper and the expenses of keeping a dog. at that point i was feeling very upset and conflicted because on one hand i can understand the financial strain on my mother with low income, but on the other hand i can also understand why he would see my request as being biased against him. i’m not sure if i’m being gaslighted, and i really don’t know how else i should have responded in this situation.

I agreed to pick up the rice and brought back the rice along with some shrimp chips I knew he’d like. I have a physical disability (left side weakness stemming from a car accident 4 years ago) and was extremely fatigued so I left the rice in the car.

He suggested to make dinner while I go get groceries. I agreed.

While I was shopping it occurred to me that we had no rice or protein in the apartment and called Jason to ask what plans he had for the rest of the meal. He didn’t pick up and since it was already late I brought home a rotisserie chicken and some bread.

It just felt instinctually invasive. Also, my individual therapist said that SHE felt uncomfortable with that (which I told my ex when I was considering abiding by this rule. She said I was agreeing to this without really wanting to do it, which made me a liar, or that I should find a new therapist who would be comfortable with this approach.)

She argued that anything that’s important enough to bring up to a therapist is important enough to talk to her about, and that I just wanted a place where I could say “mean things” about her and never tell her about it. 

I should add for fairness that we were in counseling because I’d been drinking heavily for three years and hiding it while living with her, and that she found my stash. I was going to meetings and was four months sober at the time, but she was more upset about the lying than the drinking, which is understandable. 

But I wasn’t keeping anything else from her. We’d have an argument, I’d lose, I’d talk to my therapist about it, and she’d get upset because she considered the argument over. 

Anyway, maybe we’re both assholes? I know I’m an asshole for lying as long as I did, but I guess the broad question is, is it okay to tell your therapist something and then never tell anyone else, even your partner? Or is that something an asshole would do? 

**EDIT: I’ve since cut ties with this person. I was under a lot of pressure about the therapy thing, I relapsed, tried to hide it, got caught again, and agreed to move out.

My boyfriend:21 
The fiancé and brother: 34


So my boyfriend’s brother is getting married in October. I’ve only met his brother two three times and probably haven’t exchange over ten words. Well I went to their engagement party back in April. I wore a white shirt and a green skirt that went below my knees. Mind you I have never heard you can’t wear even a white shirt to engagement party. But ever since than the fiancé has apparently has had a big issue with me over wearing a white shirt(she’s convinced I was wearing a white dress😭). I only just got informed that this has been happening for months since than. Every time this girl has tried on a wedding dress has been saying I would “look good in this” trust me not in a nice way. Recently my boyfriend’s brother and the finance shook hands agreeing that I’m not allowed in the house they are buying from my boyfriend’s dad. After all that happening I still have an invite to the wedding. I don’t even wanna go at this point but I need to go to support my boyfriend cause he is also dreading the wedding and is majorly pissed at both of them. 

So tell me what should I even do in this situation. Oh also me and him are not suppose to know any of this. But his sister was kind enough to enlighten us.

It’s finally 6:30 and they still haven’t left so I texted them and said never mind on hanging out today it’s too late and I’ve got work in the morning. I mentioned how this happens every single time and it makes me angry. I was told that they were looking for their pet for over 45 minutes cause they couldn’t find her. I told them it would have been nice to have a text that said that. After I mentioned that I was told it was self centered of me for them to want to drop everything just so I know what is going on.  I told my friend that this theme has gotten to the point where I have considered not being friends with them and life goes on. I was called a terrible person for that. 
  I got a text from a different person and I mentioned it doesn’t really bother me at this point if I’m seen as mean and I don’t mind getting hurt since I have felt this way for a long time. 
  After I mentioned that I was called an emotional masochist, a terrible friend, evil, and other things. It was also brought up that I had a fling with a person I didn’t know SA’d them and I mentioned how it didn’t click that it was the same person since he seemed like a nice guy and the person who was described was not like that at all. I mentioned how I felt terrible and how since I have felt extremely guilty it has made me almost completely asexual since that happened. I was told that’s how it should be and I deserve to not be happy and I should never be in a relationship with a single soul. 
  After that I mentioned how I am the only friend working and how I am the one who buy’s them food, hygiene products, some bud, fills up their gas tanks, pretty much everything.

It’s finally 6:30 and they still haven’t left so I texted them and said never mind on hanging out today it’s too late and I’ve got work in the morning. I mentioned how this happens every single time and it makes me angry. I was told that they were looking for their pet for over 45 minutes cause they couldn’t find her. I told them it would have been nice to have a text that said that. After I mentioned that I was told it was self centered of me for them to want to drop everything just so I know what is going on.  I told my friend that this theme has gotten to the point where I have considered not being friends with them and life goes on. I was called a terrible person for that. 
  I got a text from a different person and I mentioned it doesn’t really bother me at this point if I’m seen as mean and I don’t mind getting hurt since I have felt this way for a long time. 
  After I mentioned that I was called an emotional masochist, a terrible friend, evil, and other things. It was also brought up that I had a fling with a person I didn’t know SA’d them and I mentioned how it didn’t click that it was the same person since he seemed like a nice guy and the person who was described was not like that at all. I mentioned how I felt terrible and how since I have felt extremely guilty it has made me almost completely asexual since that happened. I was told that’s how it should be and I deserve to not be happy and I should never be in a relationship with a single soul.

66,1fael94,AITAH for still not being “respectful” to my grandmother?,"For some context, my mother 39 (f) wanted to move to Florida and I chose to move in with my dad rather than go with her, however a compromise was agreed on by me, her my father 40 (m) and my grandmother 63 (f). We agreed she’d let me stay at my old school for 2 months or up until she’d actually started moving and leave about a week before she did. This whole situation was agreed on for months and something I prepared for.

However just two weeks before the first day of school (registering for hometown school would’ve taken place a week before school and she knew this) She informed my mom and me that she had already registered me and that I now needed to move in early. And so on that same day I was forced to move half of my things into my dad’s house while she ranted to me about how great the school is. She also made a point to tell me how glad she was that I was living with “her”, and how she didn’t approve of the way my mother was raising me.

So far I have been angry with my grandmother, but I haven’t been mean or rude. If she asks me a question or talks to me I will respond but I keep my answers short, because I don’t really want to talk to her. And yesterday on the ride to school, after i  said hi to her like I usually do. Which is a basic Goodmorning. She started yelling at me about how disrespectful I was being and saying I had no right to carry on this long.

She told me I was acting like a brat because I didn’t get one thing, and I had no right to be so disrespectful to her or the family. (The reason she accused me of disrespecting the family is because they all graduated from this highschool) Then she told me how she signed me up for this club and how they could hopefully teach me to love my current school. Something she once again did without saying anything to me, my mom, or my dad. She also began to talk crap about my mom to me about how she’s so terrible and ghetto but I don’t have to be. 

I should also note even my mom and dad think she was wrong for going against the agreement but can’t do much because they can’t unregister me now.

She just got annoyed and said she's not doing much and she's only saying hi but I just repeated that I'm busy and she knows this.

To sum up the trip very quickly: I’m an introvert who isn’t assertive or extremely decisive about specific plans (I’m very go with the flow) while she is an extreme extrovert that always has energy, and our dynamic on the trip has left me extremely unhappy. We fight a lot about these things, I feel as though I’m doing everything in my power to make her happy and make the trip enjoyable but it’s at the cost of my own happiness. At this point, no matter how beautiful the locations are, I don’t find myself enjoying the trip. I’m dying to go home but we have 2 weeks left. She definitely has points that I see and acknowledge but there are some things that are difficult for me to change and now I’m simply drained and it’s visible that I’m not having a blast.

She has criticized me for many things, many of which I try to change because I’m aware that I’m an imperfect person. This recent fight started off because she asked to borrow a certain pair of pants as we were walking around that I had just bought with the purpose of (they were cheap, it’s not about the price) wearing for most of the trip since I didn’t have many other pants and we are limited with laundry. We started off traveling in beaches so most of my other clothes are beach clothes but now we are in cities. My response was “I prefer if not but you can if you need”. I don’t fit in to many of her pants and I got worried that I would be lacking in clothes if she had accidentally stained them. This erupted, with her claiming this is a giant red flag on my end, that I should have zero issue with giving her any clothes because that’s what she would do, and that this makes her view our friendship differently. We spiraled into talking about other issues in our dynamic and I seriously can’t do this anymore. I was planning to come back to relax for the evening since I need to recharge my social battery but now with this fight I can’t even do that. I’m drained.

I said something the other day when my sister and i got in moms car, all i could smell was her bo (im autistic and really sensitive to strong smells) so i said, you stink you should really go in the bath. my mom asked when the last time she had showered was and she wouldnt answer. when we got home my dad also made a comment, my sister then got arsey with me and said that she doesn't stink and that she doesnt need to shower regularly as shes not dirty.

We come from a family that is not extremely wealthy, but is doing fine and my parents/grandparents and uncles have managed to provide me, my siblings and my cousins with many valuable opportunities, such as high level education, projects, experiences, jobs etc. I believe that everyone took the maximum advantage regarding these things and strived to make a good situation even better, as in even if there were situations when some things were almost handed out to us, we did not stall, and worked hard, treated it seriously and literally made the best out of it.

My sis however was never ambitious and always did the bare minimum.

76,1fab4rh,AITA for not planning my wedding around my stepsister's busy schedule?,"My fiancée (26f) and I (29m) are planning our wedding and we set the date not too long ago. My mom reached out after learning the date and all panicked told me that my stepsister (27f) couldn't make it and I should call her up and check different dates to find when would work better. I told her that wasn't happening and our date is the date we've chosen, if my stepsister can't make it then the world won't end. My mom was taken aback by my response. She asked me how I could say that. She told me a sibling or any immediate family member missing a wedding is a big deal.

For background info: My dad died when I was 6 and my brother was 5. When I was 8 our mom told us she had a boyfriend and when I was 10 she remarried. Her husband had my stepsister with his ex-wife and they shared custody. Our plans once mom remarried revolved around my stepsister. Christmas every other year was celebrated at a different time because she was with her mom and not us. Family parties were missed if she wasn't around because mom was pissed at anyone in the extended family who didn't make sure my stepsister could be there. She would tell my brother and me we should wait to do something for our stepsister to be there OR she insisted on it and refused to let us go without her. We resented it. And we did speak up but mom said immediate family needed to be there for Christmas, for example. I told her she wasn't my immediate family so I didn't need to wait. Mom also resented the fact we weren't with her every other Christmas Eve because we'd be with our paternal family (court ordered time our grandparents won). She never made everything stop for us though. She'd just tell us we could choose to be with the family vs going with ""other people"" (meaning our family). Over time it got worse with her saying ""why did you see x movie without stepsister, why go to the arcade event weekend one and not wait for weekend too so she can join"". It was insanity. It really did a lot of harm to our relationship with mom. Neither of us wanted or needed our stepsister included to enjoy it. Neither of us wanted to be forced to plan stuff around her. We had no choice.

That's not how things are anymore. Which mom was shocked I was putting my foot down so strongly about it. She mentioned the immediate family/sibling thing and I told her I have never once considered my stepsister my sibling or my immediate family and I will no longer plan things around her because her attendance is not essential to me. My mom started freaking out on the phone and saying it would really hurt her stepdaughter and husband's feelings to hear this and how she wanted us all to be together for something as big as a wedding. She told me she'd pay the difference for a different day and I said no. I told her my days of catering to my stepsister's schedule are over. Mom went nuts on the phone. I ended the call and I'm dodging her calls and texts now because she's mad.

77,1fab3qg,AITA for going to a wedding without one of my best friends?,"I am part of a friend group of around 10 people, all from the same college. The ties from this group are many, for example, I'm dating a guy, he's best friends with another guy who shares a dorm room with another dude who's my classmate and the bf of my good friend, etc. But, as in any group, not everyone is ""besties"" with each other. We're just tolerating each other enough to do various cool things that are better in groups.

Anyways, one of the girls is getting married and it just happened that she isn't exactly fond of one of the guys. Besides that, coincidence made that they didn't intersect much, for example, on multiple occasions one of them could come and the other couldn't. Bottom line: she invited everyone from the group except the dude. 

If we view the situation as it is, she has no obligation towards this guy, however, everyone else from this group is attending and I don't think inviting him (and his girlfriend) would've ruined her wedding, given the fact that he's the only one left out and it's an awkward position for him AND for us. The guy called us AHs for accepting to go without him. While I understand him, it's out of my hands. I can't ask the bride to invite him too and I also don't think not going and somehow boycotting her wedding is ok. I'm trying to put myself in the dude's place, I would be upset too, but I believe the most mature thing to do is to accept the situation as it is. Maybe send her some congrats and like the wedding pics to show he had nothing against her. Am I wrong?

78,1fab1z1,AITA for not displaying a picture with my best friend along the others?,"A couple years ago (\~2020) I redecorated my room and decided to hang new pictures since all that I had were with me as a baby/kid. I got a pretty wire with lights and clips to put photos. I printed around 20 photos with me and my best friends at the time. It included my family (mom dad cousins), my dog, my then boyfriend, some other people and Betty. Betty is my best friend and cousin. I've printed out like 4 pics with her. 

Over time, I fell out with some people and removed some pictures. I grew to not like some and also removed. Last week I decided I want to print some new pics from this summer so I went ahead and did it, adding some pics with my current boyfriend and new friends from college (since I was still in hs in 2020). I printed fewer than the last time since my goal was not to replace them, but to fill in the empty spaces left by those I took out. 

I DID NOT print new photos of my family or Betty, since I have the last ones. I only printed new photos of people I befriended and I didn't have any printed photo of them.  The only exception was my cousin who got married during this time and I printed a pic from her wedding (with us in fancy dresses).

When Betty found out, she was upset. I explained that I didn't print new pics with her because I still had the old pictures, but she called me out about my cousin. I explained it was a special memory (tbh I tried to pick all photos from special events, not special as in grandious, but special as in wholesome for me, therefore they all represent special memories). She blamed me for not considering our time together special and I told her it's not true. She said that if I truly loved her as I say I do, I would have printed more pics. I did have fun times lately with Betty that I COULD print, but I just didn't think it was necessary since the pic I have is from our first tropical holiday together. She's upset and I feel it's unjustified. I even went as far as to print a new pic, but she said it's not the same. I sort of feel her, but I still believe it's not that big of a deal. Opinions?

I(19F) live with my parents.I have a 1 year old tabby rescue cat.Her name is Moomin and she has a weak hind leg,caused due to an accident as a kitten.She is by all means a perfectly healthy cat,but sometimes has trouble balancing or jumping due to her wobbly leg.

My cat is quite possibly my most precious friend,i am kind of overprotective over her,the first few months I had gotten her,I refused to let her out of my sight.She is also very attached to me and refuses to leave my side when I am at home.She hates when I lock my doors with her outside the room which is why I keep my door ajar for her to come and go.She has hurt herself sometimes, trying to open locked doors.

My mom and dad love her a lot but they clearly aren't as attached as me.One thing they do is lock her into places.This has happened multiple times - once in the wardrobe,multiple times on the terrace (which is the scariest since we have wild civet cats near our area),in the kitchen once and in many of the rooms in the house.I think it's because they aren't used to checking every room before locking up.My cat however gets easily spooked when locked into enclosed spaces.It's also terrifying for me to imagine her hungry and thirsty,stuck alone.When I'm at home,it isn't an issue, i always go look for her when she's not there begging to be pet every 10 minutes,but when I am at university I worry that she might be stuck somewhere without my parents knowing.I have had multiple fights about this when i've come home from university to scour all over the house,only to find her stuck on the terrace,yowling away.Every time,my parents tell me they're too busy to check what she's doing throughout the day.

Today,I had very high fever,I could hardly get up to feed her,but I managed to somehow clean her bowl,give her food and clean her litter box before crashing(around 5am or so).When I woke up 3 hours later,I didn't see her sleeping next to me like she does,so I tried looking around for her.My mother told me to go back to bed because she last saw Moomin in my dad's office,so I believed her and went back to lie down.Something bothered me however so I got up like 10 minutes after to look again.I looked all over the house and finally managed to find her sitting inside our storeroom,cobwebs hanging in her whiskers and meowing at me as I let her out.

I was so pissed at my parents,especially when I saw her gulping down water because she had to be stuck inside for at least 4hours without anything to drink,in a dusty dark room and especially because my mother had lied about her being with my dad in his office.I had a yelling match with my mom and dad who told me I was ungrateful and that they would not tolerate me complaining about how they treated my cat.All I want is for them to check before closing the doors of a room.So AITA?

I was so pissed at my parents,especially when I saw her gulping down water because she had to be stuck inside for at least 4hours without anything to drink,in a dusty dark room and especially because my mother had lied about her being with my dad in his office.I had a yelling match with my mom and dad who told me I was ungrateful and that they would not tolerate me complaining about how they treated my cat.All I want is for them to check before closing the doors of a room.So AITA?

TLDR; My mother locked my cat in a room by mistake,lied about seeing her in another room.I yelled at her for making the same mistake multiple times.",0.0,0.0792710408568382,0,1

84,1fa9jr3,AITA for using annual leave for exams?,"I'm currently a trainee in my current role. This means I have to complete a series of exams. There are two exam periods a year, one in June and one in December. My employer gives me one day a week to attend the class when it's on but apart from that I only get 1 day of annual leave extra per exam.

As I'm still working full time this makes it difficult to find time to revise so I take the week off for the exam plus one-two days off after the exam depending on what day the exam is. 

If I work more hours I accumulate flexi leave what I can use but you're only allowed to take two per month and no more than 18 per year. Because of this I use my extra day, two days flexi leave and three-four days of annual leave for each exam period

I mentioned this to my girlfriend at the weekend and she asked how much leave I'd be taking and I mentioned it would be a week. She said that was a lot to take twice  year if we want to go away but I just pointed out I'd still have leave left.

She just said I'm limiting the time we can take off together but I just again reminded her I've still got leave and it's not like we never go away. I get 30 days a year to take so this barely makes a dent in it. 

She just said I should think about taking less so we can do more trips and so we don't have to worry about me running out of leave but I just told her I'm not putting my exam at risk for hypothetical trips and that we have still gone abroad at least once a year.

She just said I wasn't listening to her and that I'm taking too much leave and that I shouldn't be taking leave off after the exams but I just told her this is to relax for a day or two after revising all week instead of going straight back to work.

First of all, I really don't think that I am the asshole here, but I still need you all to tell me because this entire situation made me unsure!

So I (17 f) got home later than usual last night. Due to my mum working, I still had to take the dogs out. Because it was already really dark, I didn't feel comfortable walking our usual route. 

Afterwards, we decided to make our way into an inner, less remote part of town to buy treats and some stuff for my mum. On the way back, I noticed a group of guy's coming out of a pub, kind of dragging/carrying someone between them. I didn't really have a good gut feeling, so I decided to watch them a little. Said person was really out of it, they called them pet names tried to get them up to their car.
 
I decided that it was very fishy, then pulled out my phone, put on my torch, and loudly asked if everything was alright and if they needed help or an ambulance. One of them quickly answered that everything's fine, their sister? just partied way too much.? (First of all, they looked nothing alike, and second, why call her baby, when she's your sister? Is that normal??) 

I asked where they would be taking her, and he answered home. 
I asked her if she could tell me who these men were to her and if she wanted to go with them, but she just moaned!
I asked him if he could somehow prove that they were her brothers because I was suspicious and worried for her? He called me a fucking bitch.

I've had enough and moved towards them to get to her. Because of my good boys they backed off of her immediately. I've held onto her and told them that i would bring her back inside and that they could wait with me till she sobered up and could tell me what she wanted. They just called me names and ran. I took her inside, gave her water and waited with her. She wouldn't really sober up but told me that she wanted her mum.
 So I gave her, her phone out of her pocket to unlock which she did , called her mum to please come pick her up. Mum showed up another hour later, really mad at me and told me that those men where her friends and I should've let her go with them. She also insulted me (and my mom?!) took her daughter and ran off.

My mum said that I wasn't trying to be malicious was just genuinely worried so generally I've done no harm. She is still fuming over how I was treated though!

89,1fa8cyd,AITA for leaving our small vacation rental after discovering a mouse was living there with us?,"
My husband (male-UK) and I (female-USA) have just moved to London with our 7 month old son.

The apartment we are intending to move into is not available yet so in the meantime we are staying in a small vacation rental apartment I found on Booking.com.

The vacation rental is very small, maybe slightly larger than a standard hotel room plus it has a small kitchenette. Because we are moving, we have quite a few large suitcases with us. The suitcases still have a lot of our stuff in them because we are waiting to unpack in our permanent apartment. We keep the suitcases in one of the corners of the vacation rental currently.

We’ve been in the vacation rental for about 3 weeks already without any issues. Today, I went about my normal routine until I started hearing scratching noises coming from the corner of the room where we keep the suitcases. I tried to ignore it, thinking it was just something in the walls/ceiling but the scratching persisted. I started hearing noises that sounded like something climbing on the suitcases as well as noises that sounded like something scurrying on the floor. At this point I became concerned that something was in the room with us. My initial thought was a rodent of some kind, so I checked for other signs. Sure enough, I found mouse droppings in the cupboard with the utensils, on the sofa, and on the floor near the sofa. 

I felt disgusted thinking about how my baby had just been playing on the floor near where the mouse droppings were, that we’ve been on the sofa with the mouse droppings, and that we’ve been using the utensils from the cupboard with the mouse droppings. 

I called my husband and told him about the mouse situation. We both agreed that we should contact the property manager and move to hotel in the meantime (we are moving into our actual apartment in just a few days).

When my husband got home he began making fun of me and speaking to me in a patronizing manner. I asked him what was going on and he said “this is London. Everyone has mice in their homes. It’s totally normal.” 

Apparently, they all live with mice in their homes and he and all of his friends think I’m completely overreacting for not wanting to stay in the room with the mouse/mice. 

We’ve moved to the hotel but now I feel really embarrassed because apparently it’s not a big deal to just live with mice.

My fam member went to a stranger’s home who was hosting a yard sale. She fell on their property, breaking a bone. She explained she wants to go take pictures of their property so she can prove negligence and get money from the homeowner’s insurance for her medical bills/pain and suffering. The thing is, she voluntarily went onto their property and tripped over a step she did not see. Had she been watching where she was going, it likely wouldn’t have happened; it wasn’t a hidden step or a flaw in the property. I told her I didn’t want to talk about this anymore because I don’t agree with the way she is handling it. She continued to press me because she doesn’t like when we disagree. I told her if she keeps pressing this, I was going to hurt her feelings. She kept pressing, so I sharply explained I don’t think it is fair to blame the homeowner for this, citing various reasons. I spoke my mind to this family member and she felt I was judgmental and harsh. AITA?

91,1fa89ia,AITA for naming all my fish long and stupid names,"I (17f) have a lot of fish with long and ridiculous names. ex. Bartholomew Davidson  The 3rd. Cornelius Bohelius Junior The 2nd. I call them Bart and Corn for short. There's more but they're too long to list here, just think of names with that type of vibe. All just really weird names that nobody would name an actual person but I personally find it hilarious and my friends do too.

I had a friend ""Jenny"" (15f) over and I showed her my fish. Unlike most people I show them to, she was not amused at all. She went on a mini rant about how they're fish but they're still living beings who deserve respect. etc etc.

This is so trivial but I think it's starting to get to my head. I would obviously never name a child those stupid names. I'm imagining when they die and hosting funerals for them and having to say rest in peace Bartholomew Davidson the 3rd. But then again they are just fish...

AITA? And before anyone asks: no this is not a troll post, I'm genuinely stumped.

Edit: Thank you all! I knew I wasn't crazy. Someone asked if my friend was projecting if she herself had a weird name, I wouldn't think so because her name is very common here. I honestly think she's just tweaking lol. Some people assumed I'm a fun person, which I'm flattered. It's half true because I am usually a very serious person in school and giving my fish weird names is one of the ways I get to express myself in ways that I wouldnt be able to at school. I'll try to reply to as many comments as I can when I have the time.

Fast forwards a few months I’m at Disney California adventure with my family getting tipsy and my phone blows up.. A bunch of my friends and family members are asking me if I made a new instagram account. I didn’t but someone made a fake account and used my old profile picture and a similar username… 

An absolute buzz kill and a feel of panic/ anxiety because this fake profile was messaging people I knew trying to get into my account… 

Through all the madness and chaos, one person that reached out to me via Instagram was a girl that I hadn’t spoken to in years, she DM’d me letting me know of this profile was real or not. I told her it was fake and she reported it.. from that moment forward we messaged a bit.. 

I met this girl when we worked at a retail store together, I always had a crush on her but I had a girlfriend and she had a boyfriend so we never engaged in any kind of activity, I would check her out and I always swore she would check me out.. She left one day and that was that. 

After the hack attempt, she gave me her number and we talked for a few weeks, and we admitted to each other we both always had a crush on each other but couldn’t do anything about it, and now we had a shot because both of us were single. So we went out for drinks..

Well we had a good time together and we even went back to her place afterwards and honestly, it was amazing.. it was like a wish that I always wanted fulfilled and it was granted!

I told her all of this, because I don’t want to hide anything and be completely honest.. but she said that maybe we should reschedule Saturday because she doesn’t want to be a part of a messy ex situation.. 

I tried to explain that this situation helped me get closure, and it gave me confidence in the way I was feeling about her, that I liked her and want to try with her..

93,1fa7yuf,AITA for asking the group birthday celebration that includes me be moved to a date where I can actually attend? ,"I (52F) am part of a large family (many aunts, uncles, cousins) where we had more birthdays in September than any other month combined. To simplify things - the family would host a ""September Party"" typically towards the end of September since that was when the majority of the September birthdays occur. We would pick a date as a family and gather to celebrate with 1 giant cake with all our names on it.  To be clear - we would celebrate on our actual day - but the large party was typically when we would invite the extended family.

The sad part is in recent years, we have lost some members of the family - who we still celebrate at the September party, but we went from celebrating 10 folks to about 4 people. We still celebrate everyone, but now there are fewer people with September birthdays. 

Last year, I received the opportunity to go to Europe for the majority of September. It was the first year of the September party since my Stepfather had passed. I asked if we could hold the party early in the month so I could attend. My cousin explained to me that he would prefer to have it on my Aunt's birthday since it may be her last birthday (which it was). I understood, but the travel plans had been made. I agreed, didn't make a fuss, and I missed the party.

Fast forward 1 year, I figured I would let my cousins take the lead to determine if we would have the party and how to proceed. I wanted to give them space since they have had a lot going on. I also have a lot going on. I was consumed with a move, lots of job stuff, and my own mother (non September birthday) was having her own health issues. My friend decided to cheer me up and take me to Vegas a week after my birthday to celebrate.

All was going well, and I get a text the day before my actual birthday that it was decided that the September birthday was going to take place - you guess it - the day I will be in Vegas (technically - I'm returning home that day). Both my Mom and Sister (non september birthdays) immediately replied yes without mentioning I would not be able to make it. I had to reply afterwards that I couldn't attend.

The person that is hosting the party wants it on her actual day. My issue is if she wants a large party - then do that. My issue is they are planning a family party and not taking my needs into consideration or offering an alternative plan.

My mom says it isn't her place to say anything and that I'm too thoughtful and considerate and I expect too much from people because of that. I'm very disappointed. It's putting a damper on my actual birthday. I just so very grateful that I have that one friend who gets it and is there for me.

So - AITA for asking they reschedule the September party to a date that works for everyone.

However, lately, I’ve been feeling not so sure  about this.

97,1fa7bl5,WIBTA for kicking out my roommate?,"I (24f) own a house and I rent out rooms in the house to help pay the mortgage. I had a new roommate move in March 23. She signed a 6 month lease and paid the first month rent March 15th. (Before she moved in.) In her lease it specifically states rent is due the 23rd of every month.

When April 23rd came around she texted me to ask if the rent she paid in March was for March or April since she wasn’t here for much of March. I replied saying I guess it was for April assuming she would just begin paying on the first of the month and that wasn’t a huge deal to me. She then did not pay again until May 23rd when she paid me a small portion of her rent. She apologized for it not being the whole thing, said she was having car issues and would pay me the rest next week. I was at the time a mechanic working at the shop down the road so I offered to fix her car for her. I charged her only the cost of the part and nothing for labor. She then paid me the next week an additional sum (which was less than the remaining rent she had due and less than the cost of the part).

The following week after that she paid me the remaining of what she owed. Every month I have had the issue of her paying small portions of rent. I have diagnosed and fixed her car one additional time since then as well. I fixed it with spare parts I had on hand. I was hoping for some payment since I was at the shop until 9:00pm fixing her car but since I had the parts she took it as free and I figured I’d rather have rent anyway and having a car let her pay rent.

In August I asked her to send pictures of her room so I could list it for rent as her lease is up September 23. She asked me (very nicely) if she could continue living here for longer with a bit of a sob story. I told her yes but she needs to pay rent on time and I would have her sign a new lease which implements a late fee. Currently it is September and I’m still waiting on payment for August. I sent her a couple texts which she ignored so I went up to her room and knocked on her door. I told her that she can’t ghost me and when is she planning on paying rent. She said she lost her job and sent money to a friend and is waiting to be paid back but she just started a new job and when she gets paid she’ll give me the whole paycheck. I felt bad because she looked very scared (I’m a tall woman and she’s much shorter so I think that played into it).

I’ve been waiting 2 weeks now and still haven’t gotten payment but she told me today that she got kidney stones and had to go to the hospital and they have her on morphine.

98,1fa7925,AITA for not going to practice? ,"I’m currently a college student, double majoring and minoring in military science. With military science, I have physical training (PT) every Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday at 5:45 a.m. I also joined my college’s club rugby team to be part of a sports team and improve my running.

Yesterday, at the end of practice, our team president mentioned that we might add another practice outside of our regular two practices a week. Today, she posted in our group chat saying we’d have practice tonight from 10:00 to 11:45 p.m.

I spoke to my personal trainer about it and said that I could attend, but I was concerned about getting only four hours of sleep before my early PT session the next morning, which always involves strenuous running. She advised me against going, explaining that with such little recovery time, I’d have a higher risk of injury or illness.

So, at 8:30 p.m., I texted our president, explaining that I have PT in the morning and my body needs recovery time. She responded saying it was all good.

However, at 9:45 p.m., our head coach posted in the chat, saying, “If coaches are going to be at practice this late, it’s mandatory, and playing time will reflect. We’re working on a new offense that no one knows, and we haven’t even worked on defense. Bailing last minute is not a good look. See you soon.” 

To be fair, we do have our first game coming up really fast but I am not a starting position yet - I’ll play flank occasionally but my strongest is a hook. 

I really love rugby, but at what cost? PT for military science is graded, and I can’t afford to miss it. Not performing well in PT also reflects poorly on me, and my future in ROTC depends on how well I do.

99,1fa76c2,AITA for refusing to let my mother-in-law see my son after she keeps trying to interfere in my marriage?,"
I (20F) am currently pregnant with my second child, and I have a 2-year-old son with my husband (24M). My relationship with my mother-in-law (MIL) has been rocky from the start, but things have gotten worse since my son was born.

MIL never really liked me. She made it clear she thought her son could do better, even though my husband and I have been together for 4 years and are happy. From the beginning, she’s always tried to make everything about her and my husband. She’s constantly inviting him to dinners and events without including me, calling him multiple times a day, and making comments like, “No one will ever love you as much as I do.”

At first, I tried to be understanding. I know she’s a single mom and my husband is her only child, but it’s getting out of hand. Whenever she visits, she tries to undermine me in front of my son. She’ll say things like, “Mommy doesn’t know what she’s doing,” or try to take over when I’m parenting. Once, she even told my son that “Grandma is the only one who really cares about you.” 

When I told my husband about it, he was supportive but didn’t want to confront her directly, thinking it would just make things worse. I felt like I was going crazy because every time I brought it up, MIL would deny everything or say I was being too sensitive.

Recently, though, it hit a breaking point. We were at a family gathering, and MIL made a comment in front of everyone that she should just “move in with us so she could help raise the kids” because I “clearly need it.” I was mortified and furious. My husband stood up for me, but she started crying and said I was trying to “take her son away from her.”

After that, I decided I’ve had enough. I told my husband that MIL isn’t allowed to come over or see our son until she learns to respect me as his mother and his wife. My husband is on my side, but now MIL is telling everyone I’m keeping her away from her grandchild out of spite, and some of my husband’s extended family have reached out to say I’m being unfair.

AITA for setting this boundary with my mother-in-law, or am I overreacting? 

 **Update: AITA for refusing to let my mother-in-law see my son after she keeps trying to interfere in my marriage?**

First, I want to thank everyone for the advice and support. I wasn’t expecting my story to get so much attention, but it’s been really helpful to see so many people validating my feelings. After reading through your comments, I decided to have a serious conversation with my husband about everything.

I sat him down and explained how much his mom’s behavior has been affecting me, especially while being pregnant and trying to care for our son. I told him that I appreciate him standing up for me at the family gathering, but we needed a more permanent solution. It’s not just about that one comment—it’s about her constant attempts to interfere in our relationship and undermine me as a mother. I also emphasized how stressful it’s been for me, and how I need to feel supported by him, not just temporarily, but consistently.

To my relief, my husband really listened. He admitted that he’s been avoiding confronting his mom for years because she’s always been a bit overbearing, and he didn’t want to hurt her feelings. But he also acknowledged that the situation has gotten out of control, especially now that we have children. He agreed that it’s important for us to set clear boundaries with her to protect our family.

We decided to invite MIL over to have a direct conversation. When she arrived, I told her that while I understand she loves her son and our child, her behavior has been damaging our relationship and making me feel disrespected as a mother and a wife. I told her that if she wanted to continue being a part of our lives, she needed to stop undermining me and overstepping boundaries.

As expected, she didn’t take it well. She immediately got defensive and started crying, saying I was trying to “take her family away from her” and accusing me of turning her son against her. She claimed she was just “trying to help” and that I was being too sensitive. 

At that point, my husband stepped in and backed me up, telling her that this wasn’t just my issue—it was *our* decision as a couple. He made it clear that while we still want her to be involved in our children’s lives, it has to be in a respectful way. He explained that if she couldn’t respect our boundaries, we would have no choice but to limit contact.

She stormed out, saying she needed “time to think,” and we haven’t heard from her for a while. My husband has spoken to her a couple of times since, and she’s still upset, but I think she’s starting to realize that we’re serious about this.

Some of his extended family members are still upset with me, but I’m learning to tune them out. Right now, I’m focused on my pregnancy and making sure our family is healthy and happy. We’re hoping MIL will come around eventually, but if she doesn’t, at least we’re finally on the same page about what’s best for our family.

103,1fa6shx,AITA for avoiding my family ,"AITA for not wanting to be with my family 

Posted this in another sub, but wanted to see what y’all had to say.

I, 22, and my wife, 23, have been married for nearly two years, and we have a three-month-old. I knew my wife for three years and lived together for a year before getting married. We’ve had our ups and downs, but we always worked things out. However, since she got pregnant, I’ve been beyond miserable. I was even arrested for DUI after going to a local bar instead of going home. Thankfully, the charges were dropped, but I can’t stand my wife and child.

My wife is a stay-at-home mom, per our agreement. Around her sixth month of pregnancy, she “lost her job.” She told me she was fired, but her job called to check on her after not hearing from her for a week. I chose to believe her and carried on.

After “losing her job,” she did regular housewife duties: cleaning, cooking, and laundry. I expected her to be laid up near the end of her pregnancy and afterward, and I had no issue with that. However, since the birth of our son, I’ve taken on all the housework responsibilities while still working. After paternity leave, I’m still doing everything three months in. I worked 60 hours last week, which is typical for me, and my weekend was spent cleaning and doing laundry—over a month’s worth of dirty clothes.

I went to the grocery store and cooked dinner. We agreed that whoever cooked, the other person would clean up. But that only applies when my wife cooks, which is rare. Last night, I made spaghetti and asked her to empty the dishwasher so I could load it. She didn’t do it, so I left the dishes in the sink.

Today, I came home to find those same dishes in the sink, plus more piled on top. She cooked dinner tonight but didn’t empty the dishwasher after I asked again, so I left it in the sink again. When I went to bed, she asked, “So, are you not doing dishes again tonight?” while she pumped milk for our child. I’m thankful for that, but she uses caring for him as an excuse for why she can’t get anything done around the house.

I’ve expressed my feelings to my wife before, only to be brushed off and told I was the asshole for not understanding that being a mom is a full-time job and housekeeping isn’t part of it. Now, I find every excuse to avoid going home. I’ll stay at work late or go to the bar just to not be there.

My wife also refuses to drive anywhere. If she wants a drink from Starbucks, I have to go get it, or it turns into a screaming match about how I’m a terrible person. This has caused me to feel resentment toward my child. I just want my wife and my old life back. I know it’s not my child’s fault, but I can’t help but blame him.

He just told me to add whatever specific song I had an issue with back to the queue and he would let it play. 

Then it happened again a few days later, and the second time I got a little more irritated about it because I had specifically added some songs I wanted him to listen to because I had found them recently. To note, he only lets them play for about 5 seconds before he skips them. I didn't want to make a big deal about it, but I told him to please stop skipping through all my music or to add some of his own songs to play too so it wasn't just mine playing. He didn't want to add any songs, he said he just wanted to skip through until he found a song he felt like listening to. I just let it go.

Then there was today. We were on our way back from a softball game and his phone died from taking videos, so he asked me to play music in the car. I honestly had forgotten all about his skipping spells until we were headed back home and he skipped a song by Amy Winehouse I really like, so I asked if he would go back to it because I wanted to listen to it. He sighed and went back to the song, then after it played started skipping EVERY. SINGLE. SONG. that played. It was on a radio, it wasn't even my music playing. But it honestly had to be intentional, because not a single one played for more than a few seconds before it got skipped, and this went on for a HOT minute before I finally asked him to just play what he wanted to play. To which he refused, and told me to play something I wanted to listen to. So I added a song I wanted to listen to, and he TURNED THE MUSIC ALL THE WAY DOWN. He said ""I don't want to listen to that right now."" and tried to drive home in silence instead. I handed him my phone and offered to let him put something on, but he again just outright refused to do it.

We finally got home and I was honestly a little irritated with him, and I guess he noticed. He asked me what was wrong, and I just told him I don't want to play music in the car anymore.

My husband likes to be the one to play music, which is fine. If I request a song, he'll play it. It's whatever. I don't skip through any of his music even if I don't like it, because I know he does.

107,1fa6ize,AITA for refusing to allow my sister into my life anymore even though my mother and niece do?,"My sister is much, much older than I am… say 17 years older than I. My first memories are of her being unable to fend for herself in the early 1990’s when she and her husband constantly asked my mom for money. She would have been able to fend for herself, but she had my mom pay full ride all four years in pilot school — then my sister decided she didn’t want to fly for a living.

So she was broke. My sister married a popular guy with rich parents and my mom threw her a $50k wedding… dude ended up being a drug addict (his brother cut him off in 1995). He never could get a real job. My mom and his parents floated them financially since my earliest memories…

Ok skip ahead my sister divorced him the first husband. She moved to a new city, got a new job and a new husband and had a kid. Then she divorced that guy and moved in to my mom’s house in the new city. She got a decent job. My mom paid 30% for a new house for her after the divorce… so my sister moved out of my mom’s house and went into her own house. Where she promptly quit going to work (she hadn’t been since she moved back in with mom), stopped making all payments for her house, stopped making all payments for her car, lost her job, her house, her car that my mom paid for and then moved back in with me.

This whole time I’m living with her, I’m in high school. She’s got her daughter there. She’s having strange men from the bar have very loud sex in her room. She’s too lazy to go outside to smoke. She’s doing cocaine. (TBF, i was also doing drugs in HS so she’s not like doing druhs around an innocent helpless teenaged me.) She’s working at dominos. All of this began in her late 30’s and stayed happening for 17 years.

She crashed every one of my mom’s cars. She crashed at least one of the cars my mom gave her. She hoarded so much that professionals had to be called into her room twice. The floors had to be replaced in the house on my mom’s dime because  she refused to house train her dogs. During this, my mother is becoming senile in her late 70’s unable to retire because she’s supporting her 52 year old daughter and granddaughter.

The whole time my sister never paid any bills. She screamed at the top of her lungs most of the time at everyone. She screamed so much my mother’s heart would act up and she’d need to lay down. She worked the absolute minimum at dominos to get clothes and gifts for her daughter. She pretended for 7 years to be working on a degree only to bomb every single interview and never get a real job.

I called it, suddenly, just before my mom’s granddaughter moved out, suddenly my sister got a real job. Juuuust before she had no leverage from her own daughter.

So, I won’t do Christmas with her with my new finance. I don’t ever want to be around her again.

108,1fa6fzc,AITA for asking my relative to purify her house before I visit? ,"Every year I travel to my home town for the high holidays. My parents usually host all our extended family for the holiday dinner but only me my wife (and now this year our infant daughter) for a series of days as everyone else lives pretty close and we’re a few hours away. 

This year my aunt requested to host the holiday which is new. I really love my aunt and uncle but I have pretty severe pet allergies and they gave 3 dogs and 1 cat. Dogs I can usually tolerate as long as I wash my hands and don’t touch my face but cats really are terrible for me, I get hives and red eyes and congestion just from sitting or being where they were previously. The only way I have found to fix this is taking strong antihistamines which usually knock me to sleep and cause me to be drowsy. Even after that the next few days are miserable for me as I still have itchy eyes etc. 

This allergy is something I started in adulthood and as a child I had a cat and it did not bother me. My parents who I’m staying with have a low shedding dog which is easier for me to be around and I can manage. 

Initially I did not even think about how their pets would affect me as they only got them after I moved away. I decided that I will try to spend as much as the holiday in their outdoor space as possible and thought that I could provide them a few of my air purifiers to run a few days before the holiday. I sent the text explaining this to them 4 days ago and said that I didn’t want to create a huge problem but I wanted to be able to enjoy the holiday with everyone and not have to go home early because I had to take a allergy pill that knocked me out. 

This morning I received an angry text where she said she was offended because she is a clean person and I have no issue at my parents around their pet. She said that her house is her animals home first and basically said that I should have hosted if I was going to make demands (I would not have an issue with hosting but making everyone drives hours to me feels unrealistic). In the end she basically said that I am welcome to come but she will not be giving me special treatment (because I didn’t need it as a child) or making her feel unclean as a host. She said that I do not have to come but she would be disappointed as she was looking forwards to meeting my daughter. 

I am really taken aback as I did not think my asks were super demanding. I basically just asked her to plug in a machine is provide and hit the on button. I never asked her to put away her animals or accused her of being unclean. Maybe I was out of line for asking this? I’m not sure.

110,1fa5z4a,AITA for asking my husband to help with the house chores after a work day? ,"Hi Reddit, 
I’ve never posted before so try to keep it kind. 
My ( F24) husband (M31) have been together since I was 19 years old, I’m almost 25. Since our child was born 6 months ago, my husband refuses to help out with the baby (hasn’t changed a diaper since the hospital stay) or around the house. This has been an on going issue. He has a physically demanding job during the summer time and I’ve always been verbal about my appreciation for his hard work and dedication to our family. The issue for me, is that I’ve asked him to help with a single chore around the house as I’m a first time mom (he has a child with a previous partner) and still trying to navigate motherhood and I also have post partum depression. I don’t take meds for it as I’m usually able to work through my emotions well and distract myself with activities like cleaning and going outside. Here’s where I may be the A-hole. When I asked him to chose a chore, he chose laundry but stated he won’t fold mine or the babies because “they are various shapes and sizes and it’s just too much”. I’ve asked him to then choose a different chore that he can complete in its entirety once a day such as dishes, trash, sweeping, mopping or even cleaning the bathroom one a week. He refuses. Lately, I’ve settled with the fact that I’ll constantly be behind on chores as I can’t make him help. Well, this evening when he asked why I was down, I told him I’m having a hard time emotionally. I’m constantly catching up, behind on the chores around the house and I’m feeling unappreciated. I go above and beyond to make his days easy (I have his clothes ready for the day folded and in the bathroom for after his shower every morning, I make his lunches at 5 am, I cook all the meals and do all the meal planning and grocery getting and I leave a sweet handwritten note in his lunch everyday. 
He sighed and set his plate down next to him. He looks at me and says “well I’m sorry I suck”.
I told him I wasn’t saying that and I’d never say such a thing because I appreciate him greatly— that I just need some help for a little while. I reminded him of the things I do that a lot of wives don’t (the clothing ready, making his lunch, and catering to his needs when he’s home) and that I miss the days that he’d get me flowers or ask how I was doing. He told me he couldn’t have this conversation as it wasn’t going anywhere and his response would just be wrong. I told him there is no wrong, just compromise and communication to figure out how we can help one another. He said that he just wanted to relax, eat his dinner and his tv in the evenings because he’s tired. He then accused me of of being ungrateful— saying he assumed that him working everyday and not going to bars or playing video games was enough but I just “need to be bought Flowers” because “going to work everyday isn’t enough for you”. 
Is he right? Should I just be grateful that he goes to work everyday and not expect anything else?

112,1fa57nz,AITA for not taking and picking my roomate from work?,"I (F18) just moved into college and I have three roomates. One of my roomates (F17) got a job that was 16 minutes away from campus. She doesn't have a car or a lisence. 

For future reference I am someone who enjoys smoking weed before bed, when I know im not planning on going anywhere. I told all of my roomates I smoke when we first moved in and none of them cared. 

Anyway my roommate who got the job asked me for a ride to her orientation about a week ago. I said yes and took her, when we arrived she asked if I could wait there until its over. I asked her how long it would be and she told me it shouldn't be long. She went inside and didn't send me any updates, leaving me in my car for about an hour and a half. 

This bothered me probably more than it should have but I didn't say or do anything about it because it wasn't that serious. 

A few days later she texts me asking if I can take her to work and I said I was busy even though I wasn't. She said okay and the day went on.

Some time later around 9 she messages me asking if I can pick her up from work at 11. Mind you, if I were to pick her up I probably wouldn't be home until 11:40 and lose my parking spot. So I messaged her back saying that I would probably be in bed by then.

This leads to my other roomate (F18) who has a car and a license texting me that night asking quite rudely if I can pick up roomate with a job from work. Which I told her I had no gas at the moment and went to sleep. 

Fast forward to today. I get a call from my other roomate who has a car and a license. She has also been taking my roomate with a job to and from work as well. She asks me if I'm high, which at the time I was and I ask why.

She responds telling me that she is stuck at work and is sick. She sounds ill over the phone and I feel bad, but I don't drive while under the influence. So I tell her that I was sorry and that I was high and could not pick up roomate with a job. To which she hangs up on me mid sentence. 

I have not confronted my roomates about this yet but I feel like I should. I feel like roomate with a job shouldn't have gotten a job off campus and shouldn't be relying on me or roomate with a car and license. I also feel like roomate with a car and license shouldn't be so rude about it with me.

113,1fa562n,AITAH for wearing smart glasses when my husband hates them?,"I bought the RayBan Meta glasses. For context, I work in the tech sales field. I keep up to date with the trends so I can be knowledgeable about them and sell them because l've actually used them and can speak on the products. My husband is absolutely livid. He says he feels like a camera is pointed at him constantly. I showed him that when a photo is taken a flash shows and if a video is recording a light blinks. You can't be secretly recorded. And for what it's worth, that really drains the battery, and I'm 40 and boring so l'm not live-streaming or taking photos with it anyway.

I like them. I can hands free take calls at work and type/do paperwork without wearing earbuds that get uncomfortable or have to be on speaker phone. I can quietly listen to music and still be aware of the goings on around me. And most of all, I wear glasses, so for me it's a win/win. 

He says he doesn't want me to wear them around him or look at him with. He has this weird fear of them that they're recording him. I asked why I would record him? He picked up his phone and held it to my face and said ""I'm not recording you, but this is what it feels like"".

To me this seems like an over exaggeration of something I'm not doing, would do, or have done before. But, AITAH for not respecting a boundary that he has obviously set because he feels uncomfortable?

I just want a non biased opinion. Yes, I could just wear the glasses when I am at work and not around him, and I feel that's the compromise. But, AITAH if I just choose to wear them when I want because I feel like he's being irrational?

114,1fa47un,AITA for making keepsake books for my daughters that don’t include my husband?,"So, I (31, F) have been making books for my daughters (6 & 2) since my first was born. Every year on their birthdays I write them a letter talking about them and how much I love them and I have been pasting them in a book next to a picture of me and them for each year. I plan on gifting these books to them when they turn 16. My thinking was that we don’t tell the people we love how much we love them and I never want my daughters to question my love. You also never know how life is going to pan out and this way they will always have a personal memento of my own words in case anything were to happen to me. 

Now, my husband (33) has always known about this. I was never keeping it from him. I would write the notes on my phone and then when I got the time would write them out to put in the book. He would even go through my phone and take snippets of what I wrote from my notes and post in to his instagram. The problem arose when my oldest daughter had just turned 4 and he came across me actually putting a letter in the book. He looked at the book and the pictures of me and her and said “what about me?” He was angry that I hadn’t included him and insisted that I either go back and change all the letters to say “we” instead of “I” and print new pictures that have him in them or stop making the book. 

I haven’t stopped making these books because I think they will be important for my girls to have. I’ve just put them at the back of a cupboard hoping he won’t find them. I feel like they are about my relationship with my daughters and I’m a little sad that my husband doesn’t see the value in that. But I feel uncomfortable that they are now a secret from him. I guess I need some outsider opinions. AITA or is my husband being unreasonable here? 

Edit: To be clear, because it seems some people have misinterpreted, these books are not full of photos documenting my children’s lives. Just one page per year with a letter from me and one photo of me with said child. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-06,"AITA for making keepsake books for my daughters that don’t include my husband?

115,1fa43g7,WIBTA for telling the school my friend works at what they say about his students?,"Throwaway because my girlfriend knows my account.  Girlfriends friend of hers and her fiancé recently moved to my state and got a teaching job at a high school teaching high functioning special needs students.  I had thought that things were going great for him, but soon he started complaining about the students.  No problem, I can see how a teaching job can get difficult and we all need to vent, especially if he is teaching students who have difficulties controlling their emotions and can act out. I do not know what level these students are at in high functioning, but from what I've heard from my girls side, they sound like high functioning.

I brushed off the complaining until I overheard his wife laughing saying ""He is having fun bullying his special ED students!"" Weird thing to say, but I didn't press.  Variations of this have been said three times now.  As the weeks went by, my girlfriend would read me the text messages saying that he makes his students read out loud the notes they're passing back and forth, read the texts they're texting out loud to the class when they are caught with their phones, and what I interpret, attempting to embarrass them by making things more difficult for them.

I mentioned this to a buddy of mine about this a few days ago and he said that I should anonymously email the school because if he is indeed bullying the special education students, that is fucked up.  At first I was not going to, then yesterday happened. But I can't tell if that would be an overreaction from me because it's all ""he said/she said"" thing and I have zero proof and I do not want to talk to the guy or ruin his job.  From our few interactions so far, I don't seem to jive with the guy so it isn't like we're buddies.  And I hate talking negatively about people, but they do not seem like high intellectuals when it comes to social skills.

117,1fa41zk,AITA for not getting over my brother and SIL causing drama at my wedding?,"Hello everyone! Let me start with the formalities:

Me (M, 31)
Husband (31)
Brother (let’s call him Jim, 34)
Sister-in-law (let’s call her Tammy, 37)

Backstory:
Jim got married to my Tammy in 2011. She has been very problematic from day one, but we have kept our mouths shut due to that being his wife. He and I have always been pretty close and he has actually always been very supportive of me and whomever I was with all my life. He was never religious until he married her, and while that is absolutely not a problem on its face, it became the source of our problems with both of them last year at our wedding.

One month before our wedding, on a phone call with my mom, I am told my two nieces (5 & 7) will not be attending. So I call Jim. He tells me he’s not comfortable with them seeing a Gay Marriage. I’m confused why this is now an issue. My husband and I have been together around my nieces countless times over the years. They know I’m gay (they call me Guncle ffs), they are aware my husband is my partner. Jim seems to think they are unaware and says he’ll explain things to them later in life. He won’t be swayed. I’m hurt, but I just tell myself it is what it is and try not to let it affect me or our special day.

FFW to Wedding Day. Everything goes off without a hitch.. or so I thought:

- After the ceremony during dinner, Jim told my parents he thought it was wrong that we allowed our officiant to include a verse from the Bible about what Love means. While my husband and I are both non-religious, we have no issue with religion and let our officiant keep the line in because we figured our religious families would like it. Nobody minded but Jim and Tammy.
- About 30 mins prior to the end of the evening, Tammy approaches a friend of ours and expresses that she disagrees with us getting married. Our friend told her that sucks and that she should go tell someone who cares. This upset Tammy and she ran outside and starts crying. Jim rushes after her to console her.

The next day, Tammy sends a message in our family group chat (not directly to us), apologizing for her behavior. Husband didn’t react. I gave a 👍🏻. Once we returned from our honeymoon, Jim texted me directly. He apologized for everything. I became infuriated. I told him I miss the old Jim. That Tammy has changed him and ruined our relationship. That I’m beyond hurt and I told him I hear his apology, but I’m unwilling to accept it at this time.

FFW to present day. We haven’t seen Jim or Tammy since the wedding last year. While I have returned to speaking terms with Jim, I still have never accepted his apology. My parents are now getting to the point that they think we want nothing to do with them and are avoiding them on purpose.

Here’s the situation, I have an online business reselling products and have had that running since senior year of high school, i graduated in may of this year, and it was going good i was giving 350 a month to my mom. I even bought 2 cars and we agreed how the financing plan would work, for the first car we would finance for 6 months then pay it off, which even after 6 months she insisted we keep financing it. i even gave her the money in full for it and she kept it in her savings, and the second car about 5 months into the financing i offered to just pay the car in full and she insisted on keeping it financed, when i mention it to her now she says she thought i was talking about using the money from the savings and not my own money when i clearly told her it was from my own money. So after i graduated we ended up going on a trip for a month and the finances was tight and the business isn’t doing as good. I did give her money for insurance, mortage, and 2nd car payments in advanced from january to may, But the trip was after the money i gave her and when the money with me got tight. She put the trip on a credit card which was about 7k and since 3 weeks after we got back, she’s constantly yelling at me to get a job since the online business isn’t doing so good, so i started applying at walmart and dealerships as a salesman. The thing is, she’s being impatient with the job finding process and is expecting me to find a job and get hired by the end of the week and even when i’m telling her i have interviews lined up next week she’s still getting mad because i’m not getting them within the same week and doesn’t even know if i’d get a job at walmart because they take forever to respond. I’m still looking for jobs and most don’t get back to me after sending in my resume. This is the first month i won’t be able to pay for insurance (We’ve had both cars for about a year now and I paid it every single month in full since we got the 2 cars and it is expensive around 500 a month) and i was helping out with mortage too. But since june to this month september i haven’t been able to help her with mortage, we were on the trip from mid june to the end of july and for the first time this month i told her i needed the insurance paid from her side. She’s constantly yelling at me randomly saying i’m lazy and the only way for me to learn is if i was kicked out the house and forced to grind my way to buying my own place. She’s also saying to go to those job agency where they find you a job because “i can’t do anything on my own”. Just today i took a 1 hour nap and she woke me up getting mad at me still for not having a job when it’s 9pm and i can’t just walk into a store asking to get a job because they’re closed right now. 


EDIT: I currently work at this place her friends husband owns, it’s a very small dealer but he doesn’t care about it since he’s gotten into real estate and it’s not organized at all, basically if i sell one of his cars i get 30% of the profit and there’s 2 other people working there but they slack a lot and i been working there since we got back from the trip, forgot to add this in. i basically stopped working there about 2 weeks ago because there’s basically no money involved and the owner wasn’t really straight forward about the job until I started working there. The only way to really make money there is if i buy my own car and use the business resources to resell it but i can’t do that since money is tight.

The only way to really make money there is if i buy my own car and use the business resources to resell it but i can’t do that since money is tight. ",1.0,0.0811445191502571,0,0
119,1fa40yb,AITA for grounding my son for ignoring my youngest at his school?,"My son Brian is a junior and his school had a back to school rally. It just so happened to be a say where my 8yo son Jake had an early say so I took him to the rally after school. I thought it would be fun for him to the rally because he's never seen much of the high school.

The rally was loud and noisy and each class did a performance. Brian was hyping up the crowd by running through the stands and throwing school swag out. 

Jake grabbed his arm when Brian went by him and my oldest didn't stop to even say hi. It got worse. They played a free-throw competition against the seniors and my son got the tie breaking shot. A few people ran onto the court to congratulate him including Jake who gave him a hug. Brian didn't pat him on the back or even give a side hug. It was awkward seeing this little brother wrapped his arms around his big brother and his big brother acting annoyed.

I spoke to Brian who said he didn't even notice Jake. I said oh then you're not going to notice much over the weekend because you're grounded for acting like an ass to him.

122,1fa3wcs,AITA for getting along with my sister's stepchildren when she doesn't have a good relationship with them?,"Four years ago my sister whom I am going to call Paula (she is 37) married her husband, he has two children who are 15 and 17, they are almost the same age as my kids.

My children have no cousins and when my sister got married, they got along really well with them during the wedding, my kids were always the only kids in the family so they were excited to finally have cousins. My sister's stepchildren are very adorable and respectful with me although they don't get along with Paula, they dislike her a lot and never had a good relationship at all. 
She always said that she is married to her husband, not to the children and that she will never make an effort to have a relationship with them if they are not interested (Speaking positively about Paula, she in the past tried to get along with them but they just hate her), plus their father has basically left them aside for Paula, they barely see him now but that's all the fault of the adults, not the kids. 

Anyways, Since the wedding, the children began to message each other and became friends, I also became close with their mother since our kids usually have sleepovers and those things, our youngest started doing fútbol together. They spend a lot of time in my house and I do see them as my nephews. 

Anyway, a few days ago Paula called me to ask me that I should distance myself from her stepchildren basically for two reasons:

1- They are not my family
2- People have begun to speak badly of her because they see that I do have a relationship with them and she, who is the stepmother, has never even gone out for a walk with her stepchildren. 

I told her that I am not going to do that because they are basically friends with my children but she says that I should 'take care of her image' since people are very critical and she's tired of our relatives (and mostly her husband's relatives) looking at her in a judgmental way and I am making this more difficult by letting my children spend time with her stepkids. 
I told her that I can't forbid my children to be friends with them because they are not a bad influence or have done anything wrong but she keeps insisting.

Leading up to fight we hung out with friends, he walked me back to my place telling our friend who tagged along they could go home. I didn’t expect him to stay but when he got inside he removed his shoes so I invited him to cuddle like usual over 3 months we were back together. We talked and he fell asleep in my arms offhandedly saying he needed to go soon but made no action that indicated it was immediate or that I should let go and say goodnight. We also had a convo about him needing to move his car or risk it getting towed during this time and he was continuing to say ily like he had been. He signaled he need to get up, put on his shoes and I hugged him and stared into his eyes like we had been doing for weeks and then walked him to the door.
Next morning I get a text in the gc with our friends his car was towed.

He'll blow his entire paycheck on things like expensive sneakers or the latest video games, and then complain about not having money for more important stuff, like school supplies or even lunch.

I couldn't hold back and told him that maybe he should think twice before spending so much on something he doesn't really need. This jacket was like $80. He only has $85 left from his paycheck since he spent a bunch of it on headphones and yugioh cards. He isn’t gonna get paid until Saturday. I suggested he save his money for something more important or at least budget better, such as school lunch, savings, emergency fund, something to save money.

Jake got really defensive and said I wouldn't understand because I don't have to worry about money. He accused me of being out of touch and said I was being judgmental. I tried to explain that I was just looking out for him, because I can offer good advice. He told me to shut up and let him splurge for once, unlike me who can splurge every minute of the day like a spoiled brat.

I lost my cool and snapped at him, saying that I was just trying to help but if he wants to blow his whole pay check on stuff he most likely won’t wear after a week and stay poor, then he better not ask me for lunch money again. I will not pay for any of his expenses. I will never take him out anywhere if he can’t pay himself.

My ex went in the shed, and found a bottle of pee. Like actual pee, i then text the friend that was staying that he has 2 hours to come get his stuff otherwise it goes in the bin. He come back acting all happy and I said that he couldn’t stay, due to the disrespect and the fact he didn’t listen to what my ex/I said. 

This friend has stolen some stuff out our shed, nothing to expensive still not the point.

Hey guys 

I 24f live with my ex ( kinda together kinda not?) and we recently had a friend stay at ours because he was homeless (got kicked out of his temporary accommodation due to his own actions). I stayed at my brothers this weekend to see my nephews, and my ex let these friends stay during the day and told them to to go during the night as we have a rule no one stays when I/he is not there. (We’ve had people steal from us before hence the rule), I come back yesterday from my brothers to my ex cleaning up a few things around the flat, and when he went to put my brothers fishing rods in our shed, we out that this mate of ours basically been in our shed, he has been smoking the devil lettuce, been smoking normal roll ups, looked through my bags in the shed moved stuff around. My ex went in the shed, and found a bottle of pee. Like actual pee, i then text the friend that was staying that he has 2 hours to come get his stuff otherwise it goes in the bin. He come back acting all happy and I said that he couldn’t stay, due to the disrespect and the fact he didn’t listen to what my ex/I said. 

This friend has stolen some stuff out our shed, nothing to expensive still not the point. 

I feel bad as this mate is homeless sleeping on the streets but I can’t have the disrespect like that.

127,1fa2z0w,AITA for not noticing right away that the product a customer had purchased was defective?,"I'm an 18-year-old female girl in my first year of college and work part time at an office supply store. I will admit that I hate my job, mainly because of my boss. He gets angry when we ask him questions if we're unsure what to do, and insists that he's paying us to work, not ask questions, and if we don't know how to do our jobs, we shouldn't be working there.

Yesterday a customer purchased a desk chair and paid extra for us to assemble it for him, and he'd pick it up the next day. My boss tasked me with assembling it, so I did so. While I was assembling it, I noticed that one of the arms seemed to have a bit of trouble screwing on, but didn't think much of it at the time, and it actually didn't occur to me to ask my boss.

Today, when I arrived at work, my boss pulled me into the back room and berated me over not assembling the chair correctly. I asked what he meant, and he told me that the chair I had assembled the previous day was defective as it had been shipped with two ""left"" arms as opposed to one ""left"" arm and one ""right"" arm. The two arms looked so similar that I didn't even notice, but apparently I should have noticed this and had let him know. He told me to bring the chair out to the customer, explain the situation, and ask him if he would accept the chair as is, or would like us to assemble a new one, and said if he wanted us to assemble a new one, it would mean that we would need to refund him the extra money he paid us to assemble it due to the inconvenience

I brought the chair out to the customer and explained the situation, and urged him to take the chair that I had assembled, and was fighting back the urge to cry. The customer said that he wanted us to assemble a new chair with the right parts. I tried to get him to reconsider, saying it wasn't even all that noticeable, but he refused.

I took the chair back and told the boss, who of course didn't react well to this and yelled at me for not paying more attention to the fact that the chair was defective, as it was my job to notice these things. I told him that it wasn't my fault that the chair was shipped with two left arms, and suggested that, since we already had another chair in stock, see if the new chair came with the right arm, and if it did, put that arm on the chair I had already assembled. He said this was my mistake and that I needed to fix it, left me to assemble the chair myself and told me to work as quickly I could so we wouldn't have to refund the customer. I did as I was told and by the time I was finished I was bawling my eyes out.

When I got home a little while ago I explained the situation to my mom, expecting her to be on my side. To my shock, she said she agreed with the boss that I should have noticed it was defective and not tried to make the customer take the defective one. She agreed that the boss was being harsh but said that's how it is sometimes. So now I don't know what to think!

128,1fa2noa,AITA for yelling at my friend?,"      So my (23 M) friend (25 M) has had a massive crush on my sister (26 F) for probably 4 years now. For context I met my friend in college as he was part of orientation my freshman year. He saw I was wearing a Pokemon shirt so we just got to talking and now he genuinely is my closest friend. He came over to my house for thanksgiving as he’s not in contact with his parents and is an only child. He met my sister and they just hit it off right away. To be honest I was rooting for the both of them to get together in the beginning. 

      However, over my sophomore year in college my sister met her now fiancé at her job. They began dating and I ended up telling my friend of that in passing and right away the mood just shifted. He got more sour and upset that she never mentioned it (they had began texting quite often ever since they met). I didn’t think it at the time but with hindsight he seemed pretty entitled but I’m not sure. We sorta moved on from it and he continued to be friends with my sister and i thought he’d moved on since he started dating a few girls over the next couple years. 

       Last night my sister announced her engagement while my friend was over. He started acting weird and didn’t say anything so I obviously asked him if he was good. He then went on a whole rant about how he was the one for my sister and how he was angry that she never looked his way. My parents heard him yelling so they came up to check on us and right when they got to the door I told him that (obviously) she can’t be expected to read his mind and if he was into her so much he should’ve said something earlier instead of waiting for his chance. 

       My dad after hearing everything told my friend he was no longer welcome in his house and to stay away from his children. I was honestly a little shocked that he went scorched earth but he always sort of had a problem with my friend for some reason. My friend left and texted me an hour later that I had no right to say what I did and that it was an embarrassing situation. I told him that it’s not my fault he blew up and acted like a toddler. I feel bad for my friend cuz my dad yelling is no picnic. My dad told me I shouldn’t feel bad since my friend was only friends with me to get closer to my sister. 

        I feel like I should’ve been more respectful abt telling my friend abt the engagement. I think me mentioning it so casually made him more upset.

130,1fa1ugn,WIBTA For not going to the wedding,"Throwaway cause my friends read reddit.

My (30F) friend group consists of 5 girls and we have known each other since we were 10. One friend (30F aka bride) is getting married next February and we are all in the bridal party. This situation pertains to one of the other girls (31F) who I'll refer to as Nell. Nell and I used to be really close until one day two years ago she blocked me on all plateforms. I asked around but never got an answer as to why. She still speaks with the other 5 girls and is close friends with them, she is also part of the bridal party.

All the bridesmaids agreed to pool together money and have a hen do at a cottage/airbnb in the mountains. About a week ago I found a really good deal on the perfect place (which would have saved us all about 200$ each) so I put a reservation down and quickly let everyone know that if we wanted this place we'd have to pay by the end of September but please let me know soon because I had 48 hours to cancel or else I'd have to pay.

Nell freaked out, she unblocked me to say that I was a narcissit who was on purposely trying to rub it in her face that she was having finacial problems and other very wild accusations including that I said she should get over her grandfather dying and that I made another's wedding all about me (I was MOH and had helped organize a lot). She finished up saying she would stop at nothing to make sure I wouldn't ruin this wedding like I ruined the other one.

Apparently she had also called up the bride and other friends and raved at them saying I was campaigning against her and was actively out to ruin hers and the bride's lives.

The bride along with the other bridesmaids decided the best course of action would be to remove the girl from the wedding party and put her at another table.

However I only found out recently from the other bridesmaids that Nell has refused therapy and blames me for all her troubles in the last two years. Apparently they have known this for a while but considered her just ""blowing off steam"".

He hasn’t saved any money, doesn’t have a job lined up, and still relies on our parents for everything (food, clothes, phone bill). Our parents have always been pretty relaxed with him, so they’re kind of just letting him ride this wave without any reality checks.

At a recent family gathering, he was bragging again about how he’d be out of the house “so soon” and how he’s going to have this awesome apartment. I felt like someone needed to say something because I genuinely don’t think he realizes how hard it is to live on your own, especially with zero preparation. So, I called him out—pretty bluntly. I told him he wasn’t ready, that he hasn’t taken any real steps to move out, and that he’s still relying on our parents for everything.

He got super defensive and stormed out of the room. Now, some of my family (especially our parents) are saying I was too harsh and that I shouldn’t have embarrassed him in front of everyone. But others privately told me they agree with me, and someone had to say it before he made a huge mistake and ended up coming back home defeated.

When I try to ask my partner to either do it in a different room or outside because it's making me miserable he says I'm lying and that I actually have some other reason I don't like it and I'm using that as an excuse. I have no idea what other reason I could have. I even asked him what it could possibly be and he said he doesn't know. 

He said he puts me through tests so he knows I'm faking it and that it only affects me if I can see it, which isn't true obviously, but yes if it's in a different room from me and I can't see/smell/breathe it, it affects me less. That's kinda how allergens work right? 🙄🙄 

I literally cannot think of a reason I would make up an allergy. I'm not even asking him to stop, just to not do it right next to me. He's literally seen my allergy tests as well so he knows I'm allergic to everything. The dog even sneezes if it gets too close to him and a dog doesn't possess the emotional ability to manipulate someone by sneezing which is what he thinks I'm doing.

While driving, going to the bathroom, eating, walking, talking, sleeping, literally constantly unless he's showering but he'll use it right before he gets in the shower and right when he gets out so he doesn't go too long without it.

Once, a group of children were walking by and pointed at her, laughing as kids do. Some teenage boy type jokes about her physique were made. To let her know in case she did not know, I knocked on her door and told her about the revelation. She was very apologetic, and said she would therin close her blinds and be more aware. 

She has, but the window is still open. She has horizontal shades so when the wind blows, if you look closely enough you can still see her walking around naked. 

I have no problem with someone's living habits at home! However, due to the school's path - I myself am a mother of two adult children and I feel it's my Mama Bear coming out, but I feel very apt to preventing her from this behavior. I tried knocking on her door again 4 times but she has not answered although I know she is home. 

I have told my colleagues about this and how much it disturbs me.

136,1fatc5n,AITA for not lending my roommate money to pay rent?,"So the situation is my rent has been due since September 1st and my roommate had let me know about beginning of August he'd quit his job in sales because it's only commission based and he wasn't making any money. 

  
I knew him back in college but wouldn't say we were close and my first time seeing him in probably 6 years was when he switched places with my previous roommate to take his spot and I've lived with him for about 6 months. There was absolutely no problems before with rent and paying on time. I didn't even think money was a problem because when he moved in, he bought a brand new fridge (previous roommate took the old one with him), dining table, couch, and bed. None of it was second hand.

  
I'd ask him every few days early August how he'd been doing on the job search and he said he would handle it and figure something out, despite him telling me he was out of savings. Once it got to the last week of August I was getting pretty concerned and I'd ask him what his plan was and he'd tell me the same thing while not responding to my texts and only communicating if I knocked on his door and he'd only answer half the time. 

He'd tell me he was communicating with the leasing office about negotiating an extension for rent for this month. He texted me how much I could pay for the rent for this month and I said I have my half ready, but I'm not comfortable paying for his half of the rent, even though he said he'd be able to pay me back before the end of the month. I know money is something you don't lend and expect to get back from many previous experiences with friends and other roommates. 

  
2 days ago, we received a notice that we had to pay the rent in full or vacate within 3 days (we live in California) and I showed him the notice and he said he had worked out something with the leasing office and wasn't sure why they were being so aggressive about it. 

Now today, he called me saying the leasing office expects half of the rent and we'd be given an extension till the 20th of September and he's been really stressed out about everything, which is very understandable and thinking about how to make the payment. He told me if I could pay the full amount that'd be ideal and he was hurt that I wasn't willing to cover his half of the rent for this month and help him out. He understood I got burned in the past by other people but he said he's not some stranger and was still hurt by that. 

I do have the money available to pay the full rent but I don't want to be caught up in a situation of chasing him for rent money. He hasn't paid last month's utilities either of about $150 for Internet and electricity. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-06,"AITA for not lending my roommate money to pay rent?

137,1fat8xb,AITA for wanting my husband to put the toilet seat down after he pees?,"My husband (33M) and I (33F) have been married for 4 years, together for 8. My perception is that for the first part of our relationship, most of the time, he peed, put the seat down, and left me with a safe bathroom situation for my next use. To my recollection, a few years ago, I started noticing the seat up more often than down. I commented that he had been leaving the seat up. Thus the argument was born:

My points:
- 3/4 bathroom actions for each of us require seat down
- the consequence for one of us not realizing the seat is up is falling in and/or coming into contact with the disgusting, dirty (that's on both of us...) rim of the toilet 
- it would be considerate and make me feel cared for if he protected me from the occasional mistake of thinking the seat is down when it's not by just putting it down for me

His points:
- he has never fallen into the toilet because he always checks so it's on me to check every time like he does 
- why should he have to be the only one to touch the toilet seat? 
- If he puts it down every time, then the toilet is almost never in an advantageous position for him and it's always in one for me

My proposed and rejected compromise: that we both always put the toilet seat AND lid down. After all, that's cleaner for the bathroom anyway. His response is that everyone would have to touch the toilet seat every time, so that doesn't make sense.

138,1fak1ts,WIBTA if I skipped my college girlfriend's memorial service(s)?,"Fake names, obv.

My (49M) ex-girlfriend from college and after, Elizabeth (48), died of cirrhosis after years of alcoholism. We got together freshman year and were together for seven years, living together after college for two. Long story short: We were budding alcoholics. Elizabeth was 21 when her mother died from an alcohol-related illness. Her father died from alcoholism. My family has untreated alcoholism.

Eventually, Elizabeth left me and moved out over my drinking, and several years later she led an intervention which got me into rehab. I've been sober for 22 years. The last time Elizabeth and I spoke was about 20 years ago when I made amends to her. She thanked me politely and told me she was happy for me, and that she never wanted to see me again. At the time, she was engaged to a guy I knew to be a shitbag, and I warned her against it. As you can imagine, that nugget didn't go over well and she married him. (Note to people making amends: Don't talk about anyone but yourself and the person you're speaking with.)

Elizabeth died the day after Christmas 2023. She was found alone at the bottom of a stairwell in her home after our mutual friend from college (and mine since high school, Circe, 49F) called in a wellness check. Circe informed me about the circumstances and told me she'd keep me up to date on future plans. She also told me that Elizabeth lost everything: Husband (who left her for his younger assistant, I shit you not), custody of children, home, job, money, everything.

Last week I got an email from a different mutual friend with plans for the memorial. Circe called me soon after to say she hoped I'd be there (fwiw, I see Circe and her family several times a year and we rarely discuss Elizabeth; my choice). I told her I'd really have to think seriously about it.

Circe suggested the memorial would be a good time to let Elizabeth's friends and remaining family, particularly her children, know the positive effect she had on so many people as a result of the intervention 22 years before. Because Elizabeth basically got me sober, I could talk about all the people I got sober (friends, a couple relatives, my best friend from high school who has dedicated her life to working with alcoholics as a result) who are quite literally countless.

I said I thought that's a great idea in theory, but the message I always got from Elizabeth after we split was that I was persona non grata to her, and that a few of her friends and family, including her ex-husband, definitely feel the same way. She said they'd put it aside for the memorial, but I can't help thinking there would be a lot of resentment that I was able to get sober and stay sober, live a relatively stable life afterward, and Elizabeth's life, from what I understand, was one long, slow spiral.

So: WIBTA if I skipped the service(s)? Memorial is at the end of September.

ETA: Elizabeth was a lifelong practicing Catholic (I was and remain an atheist), and I have to assume never wanting to see me again includes, in her estimation, the afterlife, which she firmly believed in. Our relationship may have had lots of problems, but I always respected her feelings about religion and the Church.

139,1fai0mg,AITA for asking my mom and boyfriend to help pay toll fees,"Hey all! I (20F) moved to the east coast USA from the midwest last June for college. Last summer, my boyfriend (23) asked me if I wanted to drive up 250 miles to his family’s home with him. I have made this trip once before, but this time he needed me to drive my car since his needed repairs. Coming from the midwest, I have literally never even seen a toll road before let alone drove through one when I moved to the east coast before. From the last trip we took, I knew there would be several EZ Pass toll roads along the way. I asked my boyfriend what I needed to do to get through toll roads since I don’t have an EZ Pass, and he told me he will just grab one out of his mom’s car before he leaves and we will be fine. He has lived here all his life so I assumed he knew what he was talking about. I am sure the east coast redditors know whats about to come lol. 

The trip comes and goes and we pass through many a toll booth along the way. Small side note, I did not change my legal address nor is my car in my name technically (my parents technically own it) so all of my mail regarding my car goes to my home in the midwest. My mom then sends me all of my mail via text if its important. Well several months pass and all of the sudden I get maybe 5-6 bills from all of these toll roads with each bill being $50 - $60 each. There was tons of late fees and violations on it. I asked my boyfriend about this because he assured me it was going to be okay. He told me to call them and see if I can get these reversed. I did that, they asked for the serial number of the EZ Pass I used, and they told me since the license plate does not match so it is a violation. I was surprised but mostly pissed. I asked my boyfriend if we would be willing to help me pay these, and he told me to go pound sand. 🤨

I then shifted the focus to my mom, I asked her why she didn’t send me any of these any earlier and why there was so many late fees. She said she didn’t know these were important so she left them for me to open the next time I came home (I only come home once a year since it’s expensive to fly home). They kept sending them, so she finally opened one and realized these were infact very important. I asked her if she would be willing to help me pay the late fees at least since she promised me she would send me these things and didn’t (I mean it said in big letters BILL on it…. I can’t believe she didn’t think it was important). Well she said no and its my fault that I didn’t check the rules of using EZ Pass before trying to use one. Whatever.

I feel like I shouldn’t have to pay these since I was assured it was okay from my boyfriend to use the EZ Pass and my mom failed to send me the bill until it was a couple hundred dollars worth of fees. 

I also feel like I am just making excuses and I actually should have verified that the information I received was correct before rolling the dice. Maybe I should just pay it? 

I am at a loss.. TIA for your responses.

ETA: the reason my boyfriend gave as to why its my responsibility not his its my car and he thought the information was correct and it was a simple mistake but he shouldn’t be punished for it. Especially since he technically would have paid for the tolls if I went through the EZ Pass. Which I think is fair enough.

140,1facdlf,AITA for making my tenants move out unless they accept an increase of their monthly rent,"I own a large, two-bedroom apartment in a great location in my hometown, with a nice view. Since I live and work in another city, I rent it out fully furnished to a couple with one child. They take excellent care of the place, always pay rent on time, and get along well with the neighbors. When they first moved in 8 years ago, rent prices were really low so I rent it only €280. Two years ago, prices went up so I asked for a small increase to €300, and although they complained, they eventually agreed. Keep in mind we are talking about a country in South Europe 

Now, I’ve found a job in my hometown and want to move back. However, I don't need such a large apartment as I live on my own, and I don't want to put the family living there in a tough spot by asking them to leave. The issue is that there is a lack of housing in my town and the cheapest rental I could find for myself costs €350 a month, which is more than I currently charge them. 

Am I the @sshole for wanting to raise their rent to €400, since they’re living in a large, affordable fully furnished-apartment, while I’d have to rent a smaller, older, and more expensive one? 
I said that I could move back into my apartment and not worry about their situation, but I believe what I suggested works out for everyone.
