0,1fbjklc,AITA for asking my husband to raise the blade on his riding mower to reduce dust,My (65 M) husband cuts our grass with his riding mower. He cuts it on the lowest setting so he doesn’t have to cut it so often. I have asked him repeatedly to raise the blade since it raises dust on everything (esp since it has been so dry - there is a dust cloud hanging around our house when he is done…). I hate it & know the neighbors must too. I have to wash down everything & clean our pool afterwards. He thinks I (63 F) am being ungrateful for him cutting the grass.

1,1fbjj26,AITA for hiding my boyfriend’s anime body pillow while my parents were visiting?,"My boyfriend (M/32) and I (F/27) have been together for a year. He’s only met my parents once over the holidays last year because they live pretty far away. They've been visiting this past week and since he and I just moved in together they were excited to see our new place, and get to know my BF a little more.

We have an extra bedroom, and this has become my boyfriend’s gaming room for the most part but we agreed when guests come over it would be a second bedroom. He really likes video games and anime in particular so he has a lot of toys and artwork that he’s collected over the years from different games and such. 

One thing he has is this anime body pillow that features a sexy anime girl on it. He also has a mousepad for his gaming computer that resembles a busty anime girl. Before my parents came over I asked him to take down his toys and stuff so they could be comfortable. I was upset to see that he left the body pillow and the mousepad in place.

I don’t really feel comfortable with either item but he’s really into anime so I’ve always kind of left it alone. But I absolutely didn’t think it was appropriate to leave it in there when my parents would be staying over. I took the cover off the body pillow and put the pillow in the closet and I put the mousepad in a drawer in our room.

When my parents arrived and we showed them to their room, my BF noticed the missing pillow and mousepad. Later, when we were in bed, he brought it up to me and asked why I hid them. I told him I didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable with those things in the bedroom and when they leave we can put them back.

My BF got really upset. He told me that he feels like I’m ashamed of his interest in anime. He said he’s spent his whole life feeling like people think he’s weird for being into anime and he didn’t expect his own GF to be “just like everyone else”. 

The next day, I noticed him taking some of his manga books off our bookshelf and putting them into a box. I asked him why and he said something like “I’m putting them away so you don’t have to look at them anymore”.

I feel really bad, I feel like I hurt him but I just really didn’t think my parents would feel comfortable sleeping in a room with those items. But now he’s just acting so distant and cold and he’s not really engaging with my parents at all. They keep asking me what’s wrong and I don’t know what to say.

2,1fbjixu,AITA for not booking the taxi for my birthday present?,"So I have just turned 25 and my mum has booked a show for us and my bff at our local theatre on Friday. It is currently the Sunday before and no transport home had been officially organised. This is important to the question.

So, I have discussed very recently with my mum that I am exhausted being the person that organises everything when we go out. I was speaking about my bff at the time, as I have realised that I am always the one who organises tickets, transport, directions etc when we have a day out and that I am getting sick of it. 

We went out recently and I told my friend where to go (a place where they'd been before) and that I'd take it from there to get to the location we had headed for as I'd already been there separately. They did NOT go there and snapped at me about the directions afterwards. My mum was there at the time. It seems really petty, I get that, but this was supposed to be my birthday day out. I booked the tickets. I sorted the directions. I paid for dinner. I sorted 99% of stuff.

This makes me sound petulant I get it, but, I organised my bffs birthday and my mum's birthday, booked everything, organised transport, funds, etc. everything went smoothly. When it came to my bday, it was all reliant on me. 

My mum has booked tickets for the 3 of us for a show on Friday as a bday present for me. I am super excited about this show. I only realised tonight that transport home has not been officially organised yet. Mum was under the impression I was going to book the taxi home. When I booked a show and transport home for mums birthday I did it months in advance. 

Once again, this seems petty, but I have ranted to mum about the fact I was always booking and organising things, especially the recent bday trip. It's all kicked off tonight. My mum's mad that I am lumping her into the ""bff argument"" but I explained that I booked and sorted everything for her night out, and that I was expected to book transport home for mine. Friday is not looking positive now, and I'm worried I've crossed a line. She said that I have to tell my bff how I've been feeling but I told her stuff in confidence about how I feel. My bff has a car, we don't and I've put a lot of feelings about organisation aside because I feel like I owe her for the transport fees and such. AITA?

My ex-husband and I met when I was 18 and he was 24. Getting to know each other he told me how he was into swinging which didn't know was a thing at the time. We discussed every topic under the sun about the subject including how he was into watching (voyeurism) and that he wanted me to do stuff with other people. Now me being the southern girl I am was a bit skeptical. I told him I'd give it a try as I didn't know if I didn't like it. He was excited and suggested I use dating apps to find guys to hook up with... thing is when you tell random guys the whole situation including the fact that you're married they run the other direction lol so it was hard to find anyone. I knew of one or two guys from my home town that would be down for it but he wanted it to be people I didn't know/date (never dated any of the people I did stuff with). So I said okay and moved on, however he would change his mind in a sort of bipolar way about the topic. He'd tell me to text those guys I knew since they would be down for ***, he'd tell me to quit talking go the dude in a friend manner and to only s*xt him, he'd tell me to have a boyfriend and have him over to hang out and have ***, he'd say he didn't want any of it and so I'd end everything right then, he'd tell me to go get food with the guys and then go stay at their place.... as you can see I not sure what he was thinking we would discuss everything in detail like our thoughts but he didn't know what his thoughts were. Since he was so confused I'd say I'll just do nothing until you know what you want he didn't like that he wanted me to be seeing other guys. I would like to add I'm not a swinger, don't like swinging, and imagine very loyal person to one partner and only one partner. However the reason I was down for this was because it made him happy and satisfied and he wouldn't be intimate with me.

He would also tell me I was gross (i am a severe ocd/germ freak and was always clean) I even went as far as taking meds to help with my t*ste, changing my diet, and even seeing a doctor who told me I was perfect health and nothing seemed wrong.

The only thing this guy wouldn't do was have him in the room watching because he felt like he wouldn't be able to perform properly. He was okay with that he understood. Then husband watches the videos asks for things or critiques what we did wrong and starts getting angry.

6,1fbipno,AITA for telling me husband to stay home instead of help his uncles?,"Let me preface this by saying my husband has been great, he does everything expected of a new dad.

Every year him and his uncles go up to a family cabin (about 2 hours away from our house) and prep it for hunting season. He ended up asking his uncle if he needed any help since he does every year. Well, his uncle responded back and said they were going up next weekend. My husband asked if I wanted to go up there with him but I don’t feel right taking our daughter on a 2 hour trip up and 2 hour trip back, especially knowing that some of his aunts and their kids show up and that puts her at risk for germs. He then asked if I was okay if he just went up alone for the day (leave early morning and come back in the evening). I told him I wanted to think about it but her being only 4 weeks old makes me want to say no. He of course didn’t like that answer and got defensive and tried convincing how it’s just like a normal work day of him being gone. To me, that’s easy for him to say since he isn’t the one home all day taking care of everything. The cabin holds a special place in his heart as it’s where him and his late father spent a lot of time together. I never want to take that place from him but having a baby changes things and to me helping uncles and leaving wife and baby at home should not be his priority.

7,1fbijnh,AITA for telling my dad he can’t drink my organic oat milk.,"I (27M) will start this by saying I’m a coffee snob and proud. I only take milk in it, but I mostly drink it black. I can’t drink dairy, and the only other milk that tastes as good in coffee to me is oat milk. But I also don’t like the crap they put in it so I drink organic oat milk, which is not cheap. So I only drink a couple ounces a day in my coffee. Other wise I just drink regular almond milk.

My dad calls anything that’s not dairy dirt milk. Technically not wrong but that’s beside the point. He always complains anytime I make something with dairy free milk/cheese, even though 8/10 times he can’t tell the difference. This doesn’t stop him from grabbing my almond milk in the morning. He says it’s just cuz he’s half asleep, but I think he likes it and just won’t admit it. 

I don’t care about him drinking my almond milk, but the other day I left my oat milk in the inside fridge (we have a fridge in the garage where I normally keep it) and I caught his ass drinking it. And then he had the audacity to act like he just “grabbed it” when I know I put in the back of the fridge.

I told him he couldn’t drink my oat milk. Not only does he drink a lot, so it would run out quicker, but I also just don’t think he would appreciate the quality.

I (27M) will start this by saying I’m a coffee snob and proud. I only take milk in it, but I mostly drink it black. I can’t drink dairy, and the only other milk that tastes as good in coffee to me is oat milk. But I also don’t like the crap they put in it so I drink organic oat milk, which is not cheap. So I only drink a couple ounces a day in my coffee. Other wise I just drink regular almond milk.

My dad calls anything that’s not dairy dirt milk. Technically not wrong but that’s beside the point. He always complains anytime I make something with dairy free milk/cheese, even though 8/10 times he can’t tell the difference. This doesn’t stop him from grabbing my almond milk in the morning. He says it’s just cuz he’s half asleep, but I think he likes it and just won’t admit it. 

I don’t care about him drinking my almond milk, but the other day I left my oat milk in the inside fridge (we have a fridge in the garage where I normally keep it) and I caught his ass drinking it.

8,1fbigbl,AITA for telling my “friend” a list of all the reason he has actually been a bad friend to me ,"I had this friend in class. He was that typical guy who had a gf and still managed sleep with other girls. Made the deans list. Was fit and built. Hung with the popular squad. You get the idea. And there was this class I was struggling which he helped me study for and I was grateful to him and felt like I owed him. 
After that he started letting me chill in his dorm, he’d give me life lessons, offered teach me to box and you even met my mom and was just being a good friend. The story turns dark when I get my first car. Not a reliable car so it was to only be used to class and back. So we hang for a bit in certain places he invited me too and spots me for gas a bit. And one night he calls me because his gf needs to go see a play for class or else he will fail and he calls me asking for a ride but when I say I can’t he starts pressuring me and even reminding me of the class so I agree to give him a ride against my will and the theater is not even class. So after that my parents were upset because it was a school night and I was mid studying. 
From that moment on he changed. He went to good parties without inviting me anymore. If he did invites me he’d ask me to pick him up and then he wouldn’t be at his place and he’d turn off his phone so I would t know wow here the party was. 
Few times he would eat my food. The first time he did this we were given free coffee and donuts so he ate his and I asked him to hold my donut as I prepared my coffee and when I turned back he was already sealing the last bit of my donut and just brushed it off as he thought I gave it to him. Another time we went half and half on a smoothie and I take the first sip and I tell him to try some while I tie my shoes and when it finish the guy had literally chugged the whole thing. Another time we also went half and half on an order of wedges and as I drove us back to his place he had ended up eating them all. He started 🐔 blocking me every chance he got. He’d always demand a ride when he’d go with his other friends to buy stuff or if he wanted to the get stuff at the mall. 
And I could not leave until he said it was time to go. He even got mad at me for asking for gas money making it seem like I was a bad friend and saying “when you do something nice for someone you do it without expecting anything in return” and I just wasn’t really happy with our friendship. One time he even tried force me to help him steal. So I hit a bad year in which life chewed me and spat me out and I had fallen off the grid. Him and I had reconnected and he invited me to a party and he offered to drive since he had his own car by then. So I bought a good bottle of rum and tequila and he bought some other bottles. 
The party had gotten shut down so I was going to go home but before letting me out he asked me to give him my bottles because he needed them for a party he was going the following night. I told me to give me what I paid and they were his but he got mad by this comment. He even locked the doors of the car and demanded I gave him the bottle for free. He went as far as  playing the whole “I been the best friend you’ve had” card on me but by this point I was not the same person he used to know anymore and I straight out read him the list of every single thing he ever did that made him a terrible friend. In the end he got upset saying I’m a bad friend for even remembering all that and left and we haven’t talked since then.

9,1fbibcr,AITA for signing my kids up for public school behind my wife's back?,"So, I (36M) am a dad to 6-year-old twins, and my wife (28F) is a stay-at-home mom who has recently gone full crunchy mom mode. She's all about essential oils, no processed foods, cloth diapers when they were babies, and she's absolutely against anything mainstream. For the longest time I didn’t mind because a lot of it is about healthy living and I want the best for our kids. But things are starting to get way out of control.

The latest issue is that my wife is dead set on homeschooling the twins. She’s convinced that public school is “toxic” and that our kids won’t thrive in a system that’s “designed to make them little robots.” She even has a few friends in her crunchy mom group who homeschool their kids and she’s been talking nonstop about joining their co-op. I’ve expressed my concerns about this from the beginning. I work full-time and I don’t think she realizes how hard it’s going to be to manage homeschooling two kids at the same time while giving them a proper education.

But she won’t hear it. Anytime I bring up public school she shuts it down immediately, saying she doesn't want the twins to get bullied or that we’ll lose control of what they’re learning. I just don’t think homeschooling is realistic and I can’t see how she’ll keep them on any sort of consistent schedule.

I gave her time to prove me wrong over the summer, thinking maybe she’d ease into it and have a plan. Instead, she’s spent most of the time bouncing between different unschooling philosophies and signing them up for random activities with her crunchy mom friends. The kids are constantly bored, and I’ve seen them starting to fall behind.

I'm not proud to admit it but I went behind her back and enrolled the twins in public school for the fall. I told her a few weeks before school started and she absolutely lost it. She accused me of betraying her and said I was undermining her role as a mother. She keeps saying I don’t trust her to raise our kids which isn’t true. I just don’t think she’s prepared to handle homeschooling and I don’t want the twins to suffer because of it.

She spent the whole first week of school trying to make me feel guilty by saying the twins are miserable and that I’ve ruined their childhoods by forcing them into the system. The thing is as far as I can tell the twins actually loved their first week school. They’ve made friends and like their teacher. But my wife keeps insisting they’re just pretending to like it to make me happy.

Now, she’s talking about pulling them out mid-year and starting over with her homeschooling plan but I’m putting my foot down. I want the best for my kids, and I honestly think public school is the right choice for them right now. My wife is making me feel like I’m the bad guy for going behind her back and forcing them into something she was so against.

12,1fbi0gu,AITA for not driving to my MIL house with my son?,"      I (20F) and my husband (20M) just recently had our first baby (0M) together. I have never really been around babies much but have always wanted to be a mom. I have major anxiety and have been very stressed lately since my son is only a few months old and I am getting used to all of these postpartum hormones. Some things have changed since I gave birth such as my mom (58F)  moved in and I had to have surgery to get my gallbladder bladder removed. 


     To the story: Keep in mind my husband and his mom (48F) didn’t talk much at all due to some things in the past. But since she found out I was pregnant with her first grandchild she has all of a sudden wanted to be in our lives and talk to my husband again. She has started to state that she is jealous that my Mom lives with us because she sees my son more than her. I have tried to tell her that my mom is an over the road truck driver and is at home maybe 2 days out of the week. I also told my MIL that she could come over whenever she wanted because I am home alone all day until my husband gets off work (I had my son in er the summer and she works at a school so there for she is off work in the summertime). 

    She lives an hour away from us and with my son being little still and I’m still recovering from birth and my surgery it was hard for me to pack up and go to her house, let alone the long drive there. I also want to add that her house is smelly and that is due to her cigarette smoking, I know that it’s not good to have a baby around anyone who’s smoking and the second hand smoke. So I can only imagine this also means the thick smell that lingers as well.

I also tracked the stories chronological order and we came to a conclusion that it was basically impossible for me to do those things because ı wasnt' even in our home town. After a month i visited my hometown and had many plans with my sister and niece. After a 15hr bus ride ı arrived at home baked a cake and was really tired so ı didnt get up to say hi but rather waited them to come . His husband slapped my head jokingly and asked why ı didnt get up to greet them so ı get up and greeted my sister. Everything was fine but after that day when me and my niece was at the pool ı realised she wasnt answering my texts or calls . Later ı learned she was w/ Betty. I didnt said anything because ı didnt care but it happend again. On my 4th day ı asked her to join me and our parents on a breakfast and in that breakfast she started talking about what ı ""talked with betty"" and left the table. I asked my mom what happened ( we were paying the bill with my niece when the convo happened) and basiically Betty told her that ı was thinking my sis and her husband was thinking about getting my mom' properties? I said wtf and she came sprinting on us and shouting. She texted the group chat that even ı was a worse human being she was talking with me ( referencing my dad and his brother who stopped talkin 20 yrs ago) and saying i was toring the family apart. She left the group chat and blocked everyone. I told my family this time ı would do nothing nor apolagice or talk to anyone about it because this was all bulshit and no one can make my 1 week visit unbearable. 1 month later ı started a new job at my city and my mother called me all of a sudden and told me that she was pregnant and ask me to call her since she is my only sister. I did , congragulated her and tolde her how happy ı was and all she said was ok, now you are calling. I said lets not get this situation overshadow this miracle and also she blocked me and stopped talking and basically ı have no beef w/ her and all she said was whatever and hang up. After a month same thit happened and my father asked me to call her on her birthday but this time she didnt even answer then a week later her husband posted the ultrasound of the baby to the group chat ( my ma already added her to the group at this point) and my father asked me to call her again when ı was working and tolde me that he has talked with her about how sad he is about the situation and said this can be a positive breaking point if ı called. Before my father also my mother called and said that ı should call her and in this situation its just a baby. I did she asked why ı didnt called her on her birthday and ı told her that ı did but she said why ı didnt call her in the morningand if it was my bf ı would call him in the morning. I said lets talk abouth the baby and ask her about the lil one and when ı asked about how my niece felt she started talking about her past and how ım acting the same and ı should apologize to her. She said ı didnt even face the people or her about the rumors and ı was so calm about it and ı just said because this time i dont need to prove myslef to anyone when ım in no wrone and the so called adults in this situation are acting like teenager and shittalkin behind a 22 yo ( ı know ı am a young adult they dont). I said ı dont care about them and she started defending them and saying how dare ı talk like that to them and because of me her friends stopped talking to her and also my family. I told her that ı wasnt even inclueded in their fight w/ betty and she walked away from my parents who supported her everytime and blocked them. And even that time my mother always visited and talked with her. She started cursing at me and ı told her she cant talk to me disrespectfully and she started threathining me .I said ım hanging off and she told me to f off. My father asked me to call him after ı talked w/ my sister and ı bursted out crying and told him the last part and said never to ask me to reach out to her or even be the bigger person.

They kept saying this is stupid and you guys sould do the right thing. This happened yesterday, ı tried to call my mom after she texted me that she loved me unconditionally but she was always busy to answer my calls. Today she was with my sister because she was feeling unwell and at night she had company and ı bursted out. I asked why she is always talking in plural and never asked how I FEEL. But she is alwasy with her. As a mom ı do not expect her to take sides but at least hear my story. There are a lot of things that happened before that ı couldnt included here and would not tell my mom too but this was it. I dont know what to do. Should i suck up and apologize even doe i did nothing, they dont listen to me because they get stressed but what they dont realise is that when they are trying to keep her they are slowly losing me. I need my family, ı need love, ı need respect. Please ask if you need any more details for clarification and tell me what would you do in this situation. Walk away completely?

I did , congragulated her and tolde her how happy ı was and all she said was ok, now you are calling. I said lets not get this situation overshadow this miracle and also she blocked me and stopped talking and basically ı have no beef w/ her and all she said was whatever and hang up. After a month same thit happened and my father asked me to call her on her birthday but this time she didnt even answer then a week later her husband posted the ultrasound of the baby to the group chat ( my ma already added her to the group at this point) and my father asked me to call her again when ı was working and tolde me that he has talked with her about how sad he is about the situation and said this can be a positive breaking point if ı called. Before my father also my mother called and said that ı should call her and in this situation its just a baby. I did she asked why ı didnt called her on her birthday and ı told her that ı did but she said why ı didnt call her in the morningand if it was my bf ı would call him in the morning. I said lets talk abouth the baby and ask her about the lil one and when ı asked about how my niece felt she started talking about her past and how ım acting the same and ı should apologize to her. She said ı didnt even face the people or her about the rumors and ı was so calm about it and ı just said because this time i dont need to prove myslef to anyone when ım in no wrone and the so called adults in this situation are acting like teenager and shittalkin behind a 22 yo ( ı know ı am a young adult they dont). I said ı dont care about them and she started defending them and saying how dare ı talk like that to them and because of me her friends stopped talking to her and also my family. I told her that ı wasnt even inclueded in their fight w/ betty and she walked away from my parents who supported her everytime and blocked them. And even that time my mother always visited and talked with her. She started cursing at me and ı told her she cant talk to me disrespectfully and she started threathining me .I said ım hanging off and she told me to f off. My father asked me to call him after ı talked w/ my sister and ı bursted out crying and told him the last part and said never to ask me to reach out to her or even be the bigger person. They always ask me to be the bigger person. Always pressure me to do the right thing and even for the past 3 months ı was alone and dealing with a lot of stress that affected my work life. They kept saying this is stupid and you guys sould do the right thing. This happened yesterday, ı tried to call my mom after she texted me that she loved me unconditionally but she was always busy to answer my calls. Today she was with my sister because she was feeling unwell and at night she had company and ı bursted out. I asked why she is always talking in plural and never asked how I FEEL. But she is alwasy with her. As a mom ı do not expect her to take sides but at least hear my story. There are a lot of things that happened before that ı couldnt included here and would not tell my mom too but this was it. I dont know what to do. Should i suck up and apologize even doe i did nothing, they dont listen to me because they get stressed but what they dont realise is that when they are trying to keep her they are slowly losing me. I need my family, ı need love, ı need respect. Please ask if you need any more details for clarification and tell me what would you do in this situation. Walk away completely? Go apologize and get disrespected and just shut up? Long story short :) ?Thank you in advance.",,0.024348198,0,0
14,1fbhzya,AITA for telling my 4 year old son that his dad lied about them going Skiing?,"Last year I let my ex take our 4 year old son abroad to visit his family. It ended up being a huge nightmare because he didn't bring our son home the day he told me he would and no one would answer my calls. I was terrified and I don't want to ever relieve that experience again.

The reason they flew home later than my ex said is because my ex's dad had a heart attack. I understand it was a difficult situation and he didn't do it on purpose but it's going to take time for me to trust him again.

This year he's been telling our son he's going to take him skiing. This would be another international trip and there's no way in hell I'm going to let him take our son abroad again so the trip isn't going to happen. We've been fighting over it for the last three months because he's been trying to emotionally blackmail me into agreeing. 

Our son is very excited to go and my ex has been refusing to tell him that they're no longer going. Honestly he shouldn't have told him they were going in the first place so now I look like the bad guy because I had to tell our son that they weren't going and that his dad lied. He's devastated and it took me hours to get him to stop crying when I first told him so part of me really hates my ex right now.

She said, “You’re so skinny, it’s not healthy. You used to be so much prettier, now you’re just too thin and it makes you look ugly.”

For context, I’ve always been on the slimmer side, and I know I’m underweight, but it’s not due to any unhealthy habits. Her comment really hit a nerve, especially in front of my whole family. I tried to brush it off at first, but she kept going on about it, saying how I need to “eat more and look like a real woman.”

She’s extremely obese so, I snapped and said, “Well, at least I’m not fat.”

Now, the whole family is mad at me for being disrespectful to my aunt, and she’s acting like I personally attacked her. She says I crossed a line, but I feel like she did too. Was I out of line for calling her fat after her comments about me?

In early 2023, I broke up with him after discovering he had downloaded Tinder and was talking to other women. This wasn’t the first time; he had lied and pressured me into things like an open relationship, which I was against. After a huge fight, I slept with a friend and told him I wanted to break up.I eventually went back to my country to have some time apart from him and sought therapy due to my mental state. When I returned home, I told him I wanted a permanent separation, and he agreed to move out.

However, during his time in the house, things were tense. He acted paranoid towards me but would also sneak into my room at night. It was emotionally draining because I still loved him, but I knew it wasn’t healthy. After some time apart, we started seeing each other again. He was in therapy, and things seemed to be improving. We rekindled our relationship and things were going okay, we were still working on some stuff but overall good.

He moved in with his best friend, and I started visiting him there as he doesn't want to come to my house due to negative feelings towards my family. His friend would often join us for meals or movies, and I started to feel completely ignored as my husband would focus all his attention on his friend, discussing topics that left me out or just talking between themselves. Whenever I tried to join in or make a comment, they wouldn't acknowledge me, leaving me feeling excluded. It wasn’t just an occasional occurrence; it became a pattern. I felt invisible and unimportant, especially because my husband allowed it to happen without setting any boundaries. 

What made it worse was that when I brought up how hurt I felt, he would apologize but never change his behavior. He even made jokes about choosing his friend over me because they met first. While I don’t want him to choose between me and his friends, these comments made me feel insecure about my place in his life and like I wasn't a priority to him. It hurt that he didn’t seem to care enough to include me or stand up for me.

Recently, after a holiday, I stayed at his place. During dinner, he only talked to his friend, ignoring me completely. I calmly expressed how this made me feel, and while he apologized, it didn’t sit right with me. I messaged him the next day, explaining my frustration, including how he criticizes what I eat but gets defensive if I bring up his drinking or behavior on MDMA.

He said he’d try to work on things in therapy. However, the next day, after his session, he told me he hadn’t discussed our issues because he had ""other priorities."" When I expressed my hurt, he became angry, said I had self-esteem issues, and yelled that he needed my support now. I told him I’d been supportive, but I also needed to stand up for myself.

And now, because it's getting closer to my bday, the date i'll buy my laptop, and i'm asking them for my money, they always say that they sent me money when I didn't has it, like when I was 14, but I didn't ask for it, I don't even care about expansive clothes or shoes, and they always throw me this and they get mas when I ask for MY money, and my mother always get on their side. There's money from april and they didnt give me yet. It's the first time i'll buy something by my own effort and the thing I most want...",0.0,0.0024965976,0,1

","Tonight me and my parents were talking of my childhood, I live 2 houses away from my cousin who is the same age as me and as I child I was always in her house. 

My mam mentioned that I was always in their house as a I child and replied saying that yes because her house was more fun we would do things and go away to places. My mam continued by saying sarcastically ‘sure you never got anything as a child’. 

I did, and we went on great family holidays normally once a year but the rest of the year we wouldn’t do anything fun. 

My uncle would take me swimming and my granny would take me to the zoo and other aunties and uncles would take me ice skating at Christmas or for picnics in the park in summer but my parents never did any of this. Now some of you might say they maybe didn’t have the money but I know they did. 

Now I have a niece and a nephew who my parents take to the zoo and to parks and swimming and all different places. I even mentioned to them how my uncle taught me how to swim. 

My mam responded by saying, don’t worry we’ll make up for not taking you anywhere with our grandkids (meaning my own children that I am yet to have 🤞🏽) which I then responded ‘don’t worry I will do that myself’. 

My mam then up and left the room and I kinda feel bad about it because I still did get a lot as a child but none of that material stuff matters it’s the memories that weren’t made with them that I get annoyed and upset about.

24,1fbg6gt,AITAH for triggering my husband when I share my feelings?,"Disclaimer: I apologize for any formatting issues or awkward sentences. I have ADHD and sometimes get details wrong or defensive but later admit mistakes. My husband may also have ADHD, but he’s skeptical about seeking treatment.

The Issue: My (27F) husband (27M) becomes defensive and angry when I express my feelings when I try to address feeling hurt. He raises his voice, curses, slams doors, and says harsh things. He insists his reactions are justified because he believes I’m attacking his character, lying, and twisting reality.

I realized that his anger may stem from feeling threatened, interpreting my feelings as personal attacks. I suggested that we acknowledge each other’s emotions during disagreements and correct misunderstandings gently, after someone is done sharing. He refused, claiming I’m being controlling by dictating how he should react.

Examples:
- He accused me of gaslighting when I said I felt pressured, arguing that it wasn’t in his character to do so.
- When I mentioned research on sleep hygiene, he accused me of lying.
- He yelled at me for saying I didn’t feel heard due to his body language, insisting I was lying because he was paying attention.

Last night, after another argument, he was more open to listening, so I poured my heart out on how much his lashing out has hurt. I admitted to developing toxic coping mechanisms but I’m done and recently committed to communicating kindly, and gently. His response was to insist he won’t apologize for his anger, claiming it’s his right to lash out when he feels “slandered.” He refuses to acknowledge my feelings, saying his reactions are justified due to the severity of the lies.

I’m at a loss. What am I doing wrong?

Update:

Thank you guys for your responses. I’ve thought about leaving but I need to secure a place to live first, and until then I’ve been struggling with how to live with the day to day while I’m feeling so withdrawn and resentful. 

I brought up therapy, which I have in the past, I didn’t know how to say it in a way that wouldn’t trigger him, I ended just saying “would you consider therapy?”. He hated that. We had a calm conversation, 30 min of him saying how frustrated it made him that I was avoiding accountability. Maybe he needed therapy for other things but def not for this. And generally, pointing out how I had an unhealthy approach to solving conflict, not wanting to resolve things, and not letting things go or being forgiving. 

I realized something in the early morning today. I’m very particular about getting enough sleep and if I’m woken up, I’m rarely able to nap so I spend the day feeling horrible. In the morning, he was in bed with me and woke me up, called my name for some reason and then had nothing to say. I was so angry. My instinct was to speak to him with an angry and a critical and blaming tone, something between condescending and spite. I took a breathe and tried to say in a neutral way, “why did you wake me up”. He replied “idk”. After some time, he then said that he hadn’t slept all night and just now gotten into bed. After a few moments I asked, “how did you wake me up” trying to give the benefit of the doubt. He answered saying he was trying to move me to give me more space. I turned to go back to sleep and said “I wish you hadn’t woken up” and he didn’t respond and I went back to sleep. I realized in the past I would’ve snapped at him in a way that communicated that he did this on purpose, I wasn’t giving him the benefit of the doubt, it was all his fault. I can see how he would feel attacked although I know his reactions are not right and his responsibility. I’ve only ever been like this in this relationship. Maybe this is coming from resentment. I’m scared that I’ll have this tendency forever. So regardless of how he acts, I’m going to work so I don’t do that anymore.

25,1fbg65u,AITA for telling my husbands friend that he was selfish and hurting his wife?,"Obligatory throwaway 

My (32F) husband (36M), has a high school friend (36M). Let’s call him John. John is a typical jock. Athletic, good looking, popular with girls. But I’ve been around enough to see and hear him being questionable towards women.

To the story: we were in a group of friends, and I was introducing them to my new baby (0F). Important info: I had a miserable pregnancy. The topic of having kids came up, and John started saying how him and his fiancee (32F) would be the next.

More important information: his fiancee, Janet, is an amazing lady. Kind, smart, gentle. Recently, she has been through a lot: lost her dad and her health has been terrible. Not going to say what, but she has a disease that causes headaches, weakness, dizzy spells, fainting, extreme fatigue. She has become more and more emotionally and physically dependent on him. On top of that she (and I) come from another country. It means her family and support system are not here.

Back to the situation: I asked her if they planned to have kids after the wedding, that is in 2 years. I thought that because it gives her time to recover. He doesn’t let her answer and say they agreed they would only get married after having kids. I am surprised for two reasons: she always said she wanted kids after marriage and her health is not good. She doesn’t say anything, but looks sad. 

I argue that it doesn’t seem like a good plan, and that a pregnancy now could put her health at risk. He said her “fertility window is almost closing” and that is now or never. I start getting angry, and we discuss. I ended up saying he is selfish and this decision is only based on his wants and needs and is hurting her. Basically a form of abuse. The room gets quiet and we ended up leaving. 

My husband later agreed with me, but said it was not my place to say anything. Our friends are mixed, saying someone had to say it, but that I was too harsh. I feel maybe was not my place and I was being a busybody, but after being through a hard pregnancy myself m, without my family, I know how hard it is. And my husband is a great supportive guy. Meanwhile John leaves her alone all the time to party and enjoy life. He is dooming someone that trusts him blindly into a horrible situation.

26,1fbfzj5,AITA for staying home alone?,"I (M23) live at home with my parents and a couple tenants we have renting out rooms in the house. I pay rent of about 700 dollars a month, and more for our cars and groceries (a quarter of my paycheck and then some, just to be clear). I have my own area, which is the great room I get to call my (slightly shared) living and dining room.

I didn't really get anything for my birthday, partially because I didn't want anything and mostly because we moved away from family drama. My parents dragged me out of the house against my will for it, and I only did it to appease them.

Now my Dad's birthday is this Monday, and he wants me to come with him and my mom out of the house. I gave him a pretty firm ""No"" when he asked, and he's been quiet and hasn't talked to me except to inform me of a package I got in the mail.

I feel guilty for not wanting to join my parents out of the house. I love them since they're really kind to me. My issue is that I don't believe I'm worth anything, and trying to smile hurts. I haven't been physically injured, yet my whole body hurts. I want to cry all the time, but my body won't let me. The only things keeping me going is the fact that I don't want to hurt my loved ones by taking my life, and my own futile attempts at consoling myself with a plush I've named ""Basil"" which I take to work.

I wish I had the courage to explain to my parents how I feel, yet at the same time I don't want them to know the details and start babying me because I feel like I'm a waste of time and space. Being told I'm worthwhile only makes it hurt more.

UPDATE: I just talked with my dad. Among the things that were said, he claimed that I ""Do better"" when out and about.

With that being said, there was someone in my community that said he would do it. After looking at the lawn he gave them an estimate of 50$ to get rid of bushes and weeds then 30$ afterwards. I went ahead and paid him the 50$. (Note usually I don’t pay until the job is done however I thought he was good for it)

He said he would be back later that day to do the job. Later that day he didn’t show up. He said he had to pick up his daughter/son or something. Stuff happened I didn’t stress,
He said he’d be back tomorrow, tomorrow came and no showed once more. I got busy so I didn’t contact him until Thursday. He then said he’d be there later that day and still did not show. This went on for 2-3 weeks of me calling and him giving what I believe are excuses.

My family and I did go on a trip for a weekend, and he did come for a bit and cleaned one single bush out. Then apparently “got sick” and he left his lawn clippers here. He has been avoiding me and not returning my calls/texts I’m half tempted to sell his clippers if he doesn’t either do the job or pay the money back. I personally don’t think I’d be an asshole if I did since dude owes me money and I’m going to get it someway.

So if did sell those clippers, would I be the asshole if I sold his lawn clippers to get the money back? 


EDIT: He does know he left them here",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-07,"WIBTA If I sold my lawn guys lawn clippers? My parents are both disabled and are unable to mow their lawn, I do not have time due to work, nor do I have a mower. With that being said, there was someone in my community that said he would do it. After looking at the lawn he gave them an estimate of 50$ to get rid of bushes and weeds then 30$ afterwards. I went ahead and paid him the 50$. (Note usually I don’t pay until the job is done however I thought he was good for it)

He said he would be back later that day to do the job. Later that day he didn’t show up. He said he had to pick up his daughter/son or something. Stuff happened I didn’t stress,
He said he’d be back tomorrow, tomorrow came and no showed once more. I got busy so I didn’t contact him until Thursday. He then said he’d be there later that day and still did not show. This went on for 2-3 weeks of me calling and him giving what I believe are excuses.

My family and I did go on a trip for a weekend, and he did come for a bit and cleaned one single bush out. Then apparently “got sick” and he left his lawn clippers here.

32,1fbfeli,AITA for asking my roomates to pay for command strips?,"I (21F) live with 3 of my best friends (20F, 21F,  21F) in college and we are decorating our space. Since it’s pretty big we all decided together to buy frames for the living room wall for artwork we found online. Since we live on college property we had to use command strips to make sure that we don’t damage it.

When hanging the frames we used our extra command strips that we had originally bought for our rooms. However we ran out, so I when I went grocery shopping I stopped by a store to pick them up. I also picked up a table for our TV at the thirft store, after calling my roomates to confirm that we all liked it. 

The command strips were $21 and the table was $20 so I asked everyone to venmo me $8 ($5 for table and $3 for the command strips) which I felt was pretty reasonable. I only asked for $3 per roommate (instead of $5) for the command strips since I wasn’t sure how many we would be using for the pictures and I didn’t want to overcharge. This was an item we all agreed was needed and would be used in a communal space. 

However one of my roommates says that while she would pay for the table, it’s unfair for me to ask for everyone else to chip in for the strips because she used some of hers to hang the frames. I also used some of my strips, and I explained that I wouldn’t have bought them if it wasn’t something that we all agreed we needed. It’s not like I am asking them to pay for the leftover one’s I originally bought to use in my room. If my other roomates had been the ones to buy the strips I would have happily split it with them. I’m just confused. Does wanting them to help pay for the item make me TA since its so small? The fact that one of my other roomates agreed with her makes me question if i am in the wrong. AITA??

35,1fbf629,AITA if I had a big argument with my best friend over her family friends?,"To start off, I've been looking for a part time job for well over a year and my best friend (we'll call her Dana) knows that. I've known Dana for almost a decade and we've never really had a big argument. When her family friend's kids needed tutoring, she told me about it and offered me a job along with her. I was estatic. 

Dana's parents are very nice and I assumed that whoever they knew would be the same. First day of tutoring came along and I met them for the first time: the entire family seems nice. 

The kid I tutor is very energetic and hyper, so it gets hard to get them to sit down. I want to say that I definitely don't mind this and I can relate as a kid being like that. During the time I try to get them to sit down, the mom is constantly looking at me. I try to shake it off as just concern if her kid is getting paid attention to, and the next couple sessions go on like this. 

I had been told by Dana she had figured out the payment beforehand, just not the schedule. Again, I trusted her a lot and by extension, the family that she knew.

Today, she called me and told me more or less ""the mom didn't like how you let \[Kid's Name\] run around so much and whenever she looked over, she saw \[Kid's Name\] getting distracted."" Okay. Okay. 

Cherry on top, she says that the mom simply decided this was a test trial week rather than actual work. What? 

As far as I've been in this thing, I've always been led to believe nothing but getting paid. I was never commmunicated to about a ""test trial week"" or anything of the sort. Along with the fact she doesn't think my efforts are adequeate? 

I ask Dana to figure it out, and she tells me she doesn't know the right way to word it. I decide to take matters in my own hands by messaging the mom (while CC'ing Dana) that ""Can you give me my paycheck for this week? Thank you."" She replies with ""OK."" I think it's fine.

Dana flips out. She texts me privately and says I shouldn't have done that. I should've let her handle it, I should've told her what I was going to do. I shouldn't have ""guilt tripped"" her. I reply to her by saying I didn't speak for her, I just asked for my money, and she was free to do whatever she wanted with her own situation.

37,1fbeod3,AITA for discontinuing payments of my friends sons special education advocate services? ,"My (30s F) friend and I recently had a huge falling out. Long story short, she called me awful, unwarranted names, which has left me completely hurt and confused. Here's how it started: she was considering signing her son up for the Young Marines program but decided not to. I suggested the Boy Scouts instead, since my daughter is in Girl Scouts and we've had amazing experiences. She wasn't interested, which was fine, but when I told her I needed to hop off the phone to take a call from my brother, things took a turn.

She texted me right after saying she ""didn't know I was going to be on my broomstick today"" (witch insult?), and it just escalated from there. She went on to call me a ""low life,"" a ""disappointment,"" and other vile names. I've never had anyone speak to me this way in my life! I told her that until she apologized, I couldn’t speak to her. Well, her ""apology"" was more of a non-apology where she said she should ""learn to ignore people who trigger her."" I mean, what?!

Here's the problem: her son is a handful and needs special education services. After she splurges on hair extensions, nails, etc., she said she couldn’t afford the $200 per month for 6 months that his services cost. Before all this drama, I generously offered to cover half of it. I’ve already paid $100 this month to the advocate handling his case.

But now I see her flaunting pictures of her and her kids at Disneyland, holding giant lollipops and bags of merchandise. She's also talking about buying a new Cadillac after getting a large check from her sister. Meanwhile, I’m feeling like a complete sucker for offering to help out, given her behavior and priorities.

38,1fbel26,AITA for not calling my friend when she didn’t reach out after saying she would?**,"

I (30F) have a close friend (40F) who has autism and some borderline tendencies. A while ago, she was going through a rough patch, mostly because she was struggling with relationships. She really wanted a boyfriend, but the men she met weren’t what she was looking for. During that time, I tried to be there for her as much as I could, putting aside my own needs. 

For context, I’m also autistic and often deal with depressive symptoms, which makes life challenging for me as well. 

On June 25th, she messaged me, saying she was still feeling really down and wanted to call me the following week to talk. I responded with understanding and support. But on June 30th, I saw on Facebook that she had started a relationship with a guy she hadn’t mentioned to me before. Of course, she doesn’t owe me any details about her life, but I did find it odd, given that she had told me how bad things were just days before.

The week passed, and she never called me. I didn’t reach out to her either because I felt like it was her responsibility to follow through since she had initiated the idea of talking. I also didn’t want to chase after her and beg her to talk to me. If I really meant as much to her as she said, shouldn’t she have called me?

Now I’m wondering if I should’ve made more of an effort to check in on her, but at the same time, I feel like it’s not my job to keep running after a grown woman to make her keep her word.

After their plan ,they needed someone to take care of their 4 years old son, and since I was the one available, they decided to ask me. I refused and told them that it's not my responsibility. I was raised well but by the way she treated me and told me that I'm not her responsibility when I asked money for varsity,   I decided not to babysit their kid. She decided to call me names and told me that "" that's the reason why you'll never get to varsity,  you're full of disrespect "" it broke me and thought only if my mom was here she would have paid for me.

He wants to move down south with us to get his ""life together"". He has a history of marijuana use and also has a child that he does not take care of. My husband is adamant about helping him out but I think this is related to his guilt from being a teenage parent and not being the best dad in the past.

43,1fbea7w,AITA for not being satisfied with my birthday,"God the title sounds genuinely so stupid and as I type this out it just makes me feel even more stupid and childish. I, (18), just had my birthday yesterday (weee!! big 18!!!) and it was the first time in about 4 years that I had an actual birthday party. It was absolutely dreadful and I hated it.

I did with 3 of my closest friends, which i’ll just call by their initials, F.W. (17), M.C. (17), and E.W (16). They’re so close that I consider them family, I love them to death and I want nothing but the best for them. This isn’t supposed to be me bashing on them either so i’m begging you please don’t take it that way.

I’ll start off with the beginning, I had asked all of them to show at 4:30 with 5 being the latest because we were going to see a movie at 7:00, yet all of them showed up at 6-6:20 so we barely had any time to hang out. We opened some presents, ate some pizza, and then had to leave almost instantly. We got there and the movie was great, awesome! I loved it!! When we got home though, literally almost everyone instantly crashed so I didn’t get to hang out with them at all.

The only one who was awake was F.W., so me and him hung out for a bit before waking up the other two and then we had some fun roughhousing and bouncing around like caged monkeys in a zoo. It quickly became just the three of them hanging out though, talking to each other, discussing stuff with each other while I was left out unless i butted my head in. I got bored so I turned on the TV and I was gonna just throw on some ATHF but then F.W. popped up and asked me to put something else on because he wanted to show M.W and M.C. something. I said “sure!” and when that video was over I went to put on my show but then M.W. and M.C. wanted to put on a bunch of different horror movies and everything.

I just let them do whatever they wanted at that point and I put my headphones on and stuck to drawing. We all went to sleep at around 3:30AM and I woke up at 5:20 or so because M.C. was blasting her music. I understand sleeping with music, i do that too sometimes! But she was blasting it so loud I genuinely found it impossible to sleep. She also had headphones so I don’t know why she didn’t just plug her headphones in. It was whatever, I grabbed my stuff and moved into my bedroom to get some sleep because I was exhausted and uncomfortable due to the cramped couch I was sleeping on. 

Then they woke me up at about 10 or 11 AM, we were hanging out and then we all went out to breakfast! I didn’t get to pick where we went, so there wasn’t really anything on the menu that I wanted but I didn’t mind because my friends and my mom were happy. When we got back, M.C. had to go so it was just me and F.W. and M.W. and my mom! I ended up going to our hang out spot by myself and instead of coming downstairs to me or anything they called me instead and asked where I was and what I was doing. When i told them where I was I invited them to come join me and they kinda just laughed at me and said they would rather watch my mom kick ass in Call Of Duty. I guess I got even more upset because my mom didn’t encourage them to hang out with me or anything.

I might be taking this all too personally and I might just be being oversensitive and dramatic, but it really upset me. I feel like I’m an asshole because they bought me gifts and hung out with me and everything but I wasn’t happy at all and I wasn’t having a good time and I wasn’t satisfied.

44,1fbe8mi,AITA for reminding my aunt her husband left her for a younger woman because she wouldn't stop bothering my brother who was dumped for an older guy,"I (18f) and my brother (17m) have an aunt (50s) ""Ruby"" well known in my family for being troublesome.

My brother, Jay, had a girlfriend of 2 years who has recently broken up with him. I don't know why and didn't ask since it's not really my business. I have supported him post-breakup and provided support and advice and everything in between. My parents and I have all saw how sad this breakup made him and we have all supported him. A week ago we found out this girl is now dating a boy two years older than her.

My aunt's ex-husband divorced her a year ago because of personal issues. He happened to start dating a younger woman (20s) who he met after they divorced. Contrary to what you may be thinking right now, he did not divorce her just because of this woman, he divorced her because she was being a jerk to him and he happened to find someone else after.

We were having dinner together and aunt Ruby asked my brother Jay how his girlfriend was. Jay awkwardly said they broke up and she's dating an older guy. Aunt started laughing hysterically. She started going on a rant about how she knew that girl was too good for him. My poor brother was just awkwardly sitting there and no-one even tried to defend him. I was trying to tell her to stop. Then aunt said ""no wonder she wanted to break up with you because older guys love young girls"" I snorted. I said that's actually so true. (I don't think it's 100% true, I was being sarcastic but I said it to support what I would say next)

I said her husband did leave her for a younger girl so that IS true. I told her she shouldn't be talking. My aunt got so embarrassed and stayed silent for the whole dinner. My brother laughed and my parents didn't say a word. Which is weird since I expected them to reprimand me. Looking back on it I honestly think they agreed with me lol.

I didn't yell or scream or anything like that. I said this comment in the most normal, maybe sarcastic, voice. But I'm regretting it because I feel rude.

Am I the asshole here?

Edit: Wow this is blowing up lol. Since it's getting attention, I wanted to address a few things.

1. No, I don't know for sure whether my uncle was seeing younger women behind my aunt's back before the divorce. I don't think it matters. Actually, if it really was true then it would make aunt's point even stronger because ""older guys love young girls"" right, Auntie?
2. While I personally don't think it is true all the time, it was more of a move to point out how Aunt's statement described her own situation.
3. My parents have not brought up the incident yet. I think they were both secretly were waiting for someone to call her out but too scared to do it themselves. Especially my mom (her sister) who grew up alongside golden child Ruby. I'm not going to get into the whole thing here but that was basically the dynamic summed in one sentence.

Edit 2: My brother has always been nothing but loving and kind to his (now ex) girlfriend. If something was up with them, we would have already known. Obviously if he was an asshole to his gf then I would be on aunt's side, but that's not the case here.

46,1fbdvod,WIBTA if I continued to charge my mom rent on a paid off house?,"Okay, backstory: 

Mom and Dad are typical boomers who didn't plan for retirement. Well, actually, they had me and figured that was their retirement. They also divorced. 

Now I pay half of Dad's rent so he can live in an apartment. He's since become disabled from a lifetime of manual labor and lives off a tiny social security check.

Mom stays with me in a house I own, and she pays 600 in rent. That is way, way, way under market value.

Needless to say, my parents were never wise with money. I became... a little obsessive about finances at a young age after my dad's second bankruptcy.

Because of this, I've been cagey af about how much I make. And it's a lot. I'll be clearing a half mil this year in sales alone. Despite that, I live a very modest life and my parents are more than slightly out of touch with today's economics. 

They're not stupid -- I know they suspect I make more than I let on, but there is no way they know how much. They likely think around 100k which to them is extremely well off. 

My issue is after my taxes are done next year I plan to completely pay off my house. In my opinion it would be kind of fucked up to continue to charge my mother rent on a house I only have to pay taxes and insurance on. (It should be 400 a month, max.) She's about to ""retire"" with an even tinier social security check than my dad.

But at the same time, I can't fess up to how much I've been making. It will cause so many problems. There will be *expectations* on sharing the wealth. And then resentment when I don't. 

I won't have any kids. I have to look out for my own retirement.

I don't know what to do. I can't tell them the house is paid because then they'll wonder why. Would I be the asshole for taking money I don't need out of my mom's social security check? Even if I save it to give it back for later, I'm still denying her the opportunity she had to spend her own money. That's also messed up.

I live in a small town in AB, Canada. It’s our Fall Festival, this morning was the parade. I think it’s important to note that parade routes and road closures are heavily advertised and notices up all around town, so they aren’t a shock to anyone.

Our house is right on the route so I, like a good citizen, get up extra early to move our cars, we make sure grass is cut, all that jazz.

As I’m sitting there, I see a woman walking with purpose toward the street/barrier from the parking lot. A car following close behind her. She walked about five feet into the street, looked up and down, saw where the parade was, looked back at the car, shrugged and literally made an “eeehhh I don’t know” gesture and face. Then moved toward the barrier. Here’s my potential AH territory-I yelled out “Don’t do it!!” And she immediately squared her shoulders and whirled around to look at me.

I did repeat that about 5-6 times as she kept yelling about him just needing to get to work… Then someone passing by stopped to talk to her, and told her how her husband could get out without disturbing the barriers.

49,1fbcxuq,AITA for not letting my brother in the front passenger seat of my car?,"For context, I (17F) recently passed my driver’s test and got myself a used car with saved up money from working/birthdays. My brother(13M) always bitches about sitting in the front and my parents tell me to let it go since I’m older and supposed to be more understanding. When he sits in the front and I’m behind him he purposely pushes his seat back or turns up the AC in the car because I’m the one who gets affected by it most. Even when I’m sitting in the front, he makes me go in the back by either not entering until I get out or sitting in my lap till I stand up (he’s 100lbs heavier than me) and if we’re both sitting in the back he climbs over to the front, breaking and dropping a bunch of things in the process. I told him that when I have my own car, he’s never seeing the front, ever, but he thought I was bluffing.

Yesterday, I was the only one who could pick up my brother from his friend’s house a few kilometers away, and I came, but when he tried sitting in the front he saw that he couldn’t open the doors since I locked them and he had to sit in the back.

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-07,"AITA for not letting my brother in the front passenger seat of my car? For context, I (17F) recently passed my driver’s test and got myself a used car with saved up money from working/birthdays. My brother(13M) always bitches about sitting in the front and my parents tell me to let it go since I’m older and supposed to be more understanding. When he sits in the front and I’m behind him he purposely pushes his seat back or turns up the AC in the car because I’m the one who gets affected by it most. Even when I’m sitting in the front, he makes me go in the back by either not entering until I get out or sitting in my lap till I stand up (he’s 100lbs heavier than me) and if we’re both sitting in the back he climbs over to the front, breaking and dropping a bunch of things in the process. I told him that when I have my own car, he’s never seeing the front, ever, but he thought I was bluffing.

Yesterday, I was the only one who could pick up my brother from his friend’s house a few kilometers away, and I came, but when he tried sitting in the front he saw that he couldn’t open the doors since I locked them and he had to sit in the back. He didn’t like this one bit since I was belittling him in front of his friends and threatened to not come, but I told him this is his only choice.

50,1fbcw56,AITA for spending time on the game?,"I have been in a relationship with my boyfriend for 4 years now.  When we first started dating, we discussed our interests/hobbies, etc. We have a couple of shared interests that help us spend time together as a majority of couples do like hiking, reading and photography. I made it abundantly clear that I was an avid gamer aside from being a  responsible adult and having a full time job. In the morning, I have my routine which consist of making my coffee, tending to household chores, tending to personal hygiene and cooking a meal to take with me to the office. With whatever time I have left, I'll play the game until it's time for me to leave for the day. When I come home after a long day of work at the bank, I'll shower, change, spend a little time with my boyfriend, and hop on the game for about 2-3 hours when my friends are on.  On my days off, I maintain the same routine, and if plans arent being made to go out I'll stay at home and read a book or play my game.  He complains that I don't spend enough time with him but insists that he doesn't want to spend time with me when I make the time?  It's important to note that my boyfriend is not a gamer although will occasionally play his switch from time to time.  Although our relationship is overall healthy and well functioning, he seems to have an issue with me picking up the game despite making time for him and juggling responsibilities.  He feels as though I play too much or could be doing something better with my time and I have grown to feel somewhat insecure, lazy perhaps.  I always keep an ear out for him if he needs anything so I'm not ignoring him, and always welcome him to my space to hang out even if we're aren't interacting constantly.  At times, he will get upset out of nowhere and on occasion will try to force me off the game even when it means affecting myself and those that I'm playing with. Like I said, I have a full time job and a social life, and do not criticize him for whatever he chooses to do with his free time.  AITA?

I live in the same neighborhood, so it takes less time than driving and helps me get in a bit of exercise. It’s my usual commute, and I enjoy it, but I don't wear a helmet or other safety gear. Recently, one of the client's parents (40ish F) confronted me in the parking lot about it, saying that since I’m around kids all day and they can see me biking, I'm setting a bad example. She said I should wear a helmet because the kids ""look up to \[me\],"" and I should model better behavior.

Now, I understand where she's coming from, but I also feel like what I do outside of work isn't exactly their business, and it’s additionally weird since I'm not *her* kid's therapist. Plus, I feel like it's a personal choice—I'm an adult, and I get to make that call for myself. Some of the kids that go to the clinic are developmentally delayed. Still, I tend to work with kids with hyperlexia and hypernumeracy - I know my clients can understand the difference between kids' rules and adult privileges. 

I didn’t get into an argument with the parent, but now I’m wondering if I’m being unreasonable or if they’re overstepping. My supervisor refuses to take a side either way but did tell the parent that if she swears at me again, she will not be welcome in our clinic.

54,1fbckwz,AITA my mom keeps offering financial help to others,"Through growing up and through many years my adulthood, my mother has financially helped me, my siblings and many of her friends. She’s a wonderful person to know. However, she expects people to prioritize paying her back over anything else they have to pay/do. 

She has her opinions and I have mine. She thinks she should be able to bitch at people when they don’t pay her back right away. Which in a way, she can. 

Anyways, she offered to help me pay a bill I needed to pay, I didn’t have a job at the time and all my other bills have also not been paid for about two months in total. 

So she offered to make payments for me, I told her if that’s what she wanted to do, then she could do it. I also said I would very much appreciate the help she was offering and I thank, thanked her constantly for it. I never once asked her for it nor have I said I needed her to help me. I just told her my situation and and was wondering what she would do in my position.

 She took it upon herself to offer her help to me. I took it, and now I’m getting berated for it. I can’t afford to pay her back right now, as I had a job and lost it due to moving to another state again. I am currently looking for another job and I will pay her back when I get my bills caught up and everything is settled. Am I the asshole for telling her if she’s going to offer someone financial assistance, don’t bitch about it later? 

I have helped others financially before. Some have paid me back, while others have not. I did not bitch about it either way it went to the ones that I have helped because I don’t see why I should waste my energy on it. Once they have the money, they might pay me back, they might not. I just know if they don’t, I won’t help them again. 

I just really want to know if I’m justified in telling her she shouldn’t offer financial help, if she’s going to bitch about it later. 

I feel like I could be the asshole because everyone has a right to their own opinion. 

However I also think I am not the asshole because I don’t think you need to tell everyone your opinion.

So eventually I called bbg to pick it up on a mutually agreed date but bbg told me “I’m tired I’m not coming anymore.” I let it slide and set a different date when I wasn’t busy, bbg agreed and I said 👍.

I even marked it on my calendar.” (Bbg lost all my respects for him so I’ll be using pronouns as “he/him”) He said “I miss it.” So I explained to him how I had an interview that day and that it was impossible for me to go home and get it for him. He played victim. He said “I’m disappointed, I want to cry, I’ll be waiting all night at the front of the apartment.” I was scared, I wanted him gone at this point. “Please don’t, go home it’s not what we agreed on and now you’re the only one suffering, for your safety I want you to go home so you won’t get heat stroke.” He didn’t like that, not one bit.

59,1fbc485,AITA for telling a guy he looks huggable,"I (17f) was hanging out with my friends, all the same age, a mix of both guys and girls. We were playing this game where we decided who is the most \_\_\_\_\_ in the room. For example, everyone deemed me the most friendly in the room. They are all silly dumb things, nothing that could hurt anyone. Or so I thought.

The next question was who is the most huggable in the room. I thought about it and pointed at my friend ""John"" (17m). I said ""Definitely him."" Everyone unanimously agreed. John got really offended and mad. He disagreed with us and then left.

They are all silly dumb things, nothing that could hurt anyone. Or so I thought.

The next question was who is the most huggable in the room. I thought about it and pointed at my friend ""John"" (17m). I said ""Definitely him."" Everyone unanimously agreed. John got really offended and mad. He disagreed with us and then left.

60,1fbbxoy,AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop comparing his past sports injuries to my period pain?,"I (22F) was recently diagnosed with stage 2 endometriosis after years of dealing with excruciating menstrual pain. For those who don’t know, endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the uterus’ lining grows outside of the uterus. This can affect the body in multiple ways, however, the most common issue are painful periods.

Now, because it’s hard to describe how painful cramping can be, just keep in mind that I take at least one day off each month to either whither away in my apartment or check myself into the ER.  My boyfriend knows everything relating to the condition and has always tried his best to help when I’m going through it; however, one thing I couldn’t help but be bothered by was his constant comparison of my menstrual pain to his past Highschool football injuries (we’re both 22). 

Although the comparison always rubbed me the wrong way, I get that he was coming from a good place. My issue was that he’d bring it up while I was actively curled in fetal position and going in and out of consciousness. This has happened for a couple of months now, so when he brought up the “similarities” again while I was going through it yesterday, I kind of snapped and asked why he thought that a ligament tear and endometriosis were anything alike. He told me that he was just trying to empathize with my pain, and I said that although I understood, could you please stop comparing the two. He scoffed at me and left my apartment.

While I understand he didn’t make the comparisons with bad intentions, am I in the wrong for getting mad? Especially after he stormed out knowing I was still actively in pain. I plan on talking with him about it now that I’m feeling better, but I want to know from an outside perspective whether I was taking it all too personally and/or was the asshole in the situation.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-07,"AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop comparing his past sports injuries to my period pain?

61,1fbbubb,AITA- Husband and booze  ,"My husband and I have been married 5 years (todays our anniversary). We have a 1.5 yo and 3.5 yo. He’s always enjoyed his beers and spiked seltzers, but over the last year or so, I’m getting concerned.

He’s almost 35 years old. He drinks everyday, on average 3-4 drinks. On weekends, he has 3-9 drinks. He always feels like crap in the morning, sometimes throughout the day. He literally hasn’t gone one day without a drink in the last couple years, and the only reason he did a few years ago was because he was on antibiotics. 

He isn’t a mean drunk or anything, but he’s a lot less helpful the next 48 hours, and more importantly, I’m worried about his health. His annual physical blood work comes back fine. 

Last night it was 11:30pm and he said he was going to have one more, and I asked if he could have a water, and he grabbed a nip of fireball. I got annoyed and we got in a massive fight. He honestly believes I’m just nagging him bc I “love to complain”. I really don’t give a f about whether he drinks, I just think he doesn’t realize he’s not 22 y/o anymore and it does and will have health repercussions. I’ve told him it’s science, the liver can only process so much. But he just gets defensive and so angry. I don’t know how to approach this in a way that he doesn’t see as me just complaining. 

How do I make him see that I just want him to cut back for his own health and so he’s around for a long time? How do I convey it’s not normal. None of his friends drink this much/often. How do I make him see that it’s serious.. ?

62,1fbbpfe,AITA for assuming my husband should unclog the toilet (he clogged with his p**p) before we leave for the beach?,"To preface this, we have been having some marital problems so I'm unsure if I'm just upset about a lot of things going on or if this is a reasonable assumption.

So, I asked him if he wanted to go to the beach this morning. He said yes. Great. I was waiting for the laundry to finish so I wasn't in a rush. He goes to the bathroom, the laundry finished around the same time and I say are you about ready to go? 

He looks at me and says ya but the toilet is clogged, I need to find a plunger. I say ok, if u can't find a plunger sometimes (ik sorry gross, but) u can just mix it around a bit and throw out whatever you used. 

So, I go back to what I'm doing and I assume he's trying to find a plunger. We don't have one in the apt, we live in a building with a maintenance guy. So, I figured he had texted him to ask for one.

About 15 min go by and I ask if he's found a plunger he says no he was waiting for it to drain and to try again. I told him he'd most likely need a plunger. He tries to flush again and it didn't work. Ok, no problem. I assume again he's gone to find a plunger. 

Another 15 min or so go by and I call out for my husband because it was kind of quiet. I find him lying on the couch on his phone. I say oh did u text maintenance guy for a plunger and he says no why would I do that, we're going to the beach aren't we?

I said yes we're going to the beach, but I really didn't think you thought it would be ok to leave poop in the toilet all day, I'm going to have to use the bathroom before we leave for the beach, like that's gross. Plus there's the only mirror we have in that bathroom and I need it to put on sunscreen and get ready etc. At this point he gets upset, tries to flush the toilet again, slams doors around and leaves the house, presumably at this point to find/buy a plunger. 

So, AITA for assuming the toilet should be fixed before we go to the beach?

Edit: since this keeps coming up, I'll address it here. My husband moved from our home country for work in November. I JUST moved here August 29. This hasn't been an issue before as far as I know. I was unaware of there being no plunger in the apartment upon my arrival. I agree we SHOULD have one, and we do now.

We've also asked our dad to ask before taking our snacks, he always says he will but he never does. If we don't eat the snacks we bought in 24 hours you can bet it's already gone.

My siblings and I are sick of this. We've tried everything. ""Hey Dad, I bought (snack) I'm saving it for later, please ask if you'd like some."" Nope! Tried telling mom and she said that he's tired, he deserves it, etc. Nope! But mom has a lot on her plate rn so we don't push her further. this has been an issue for a few months now.

Last week I came back from a really bad day at school and I was really tired and looking forward to eat (specific snack that I bought). Lo and behold, it was eaten. Found my dad passed out in his room with the snack bag wide open. I was mad but I didn't want to start a fight so I got something else and left.

Now I've started hiding my snacks in my closet instead of the pantry because I know my dad wouldn't dare to look in my closet. I also let my siblings hide some of their stuff in there too. Dad noticed this and complained that there wasn't many snacks. It was about two weeks before he found out about our secret stash.

My dad called me an AH saying that snacks are meant to be shared and anything in this house was fair game because we are all a family.

He called me childish and I said of course I'm childish, I'm a child. I was almost about to say ""I'm a child but what's your excuse"" but didn't think that was a smart idea so I just left.

me: ""but he will literally get the same notes??? cant she study when shes the one whos gotta pass the exam this yeat?""
mom: ""oh i see how it is you just prefer (niece) over YOUR OWN BROTHER! just like your grandma""
sidenotev2: in my family ""just like your grandma"" is a really mean thing to say
and ive went to my room, have been crying since
my dad is on her side too, and its the shittiest way to be, because at first he tells me that he knows shes delulu this way, but then when she comes he sides with her and tells me that i should leave.
and my brother even said that he doesn't need them. i told him that if hell need some help then ill gladly help him or try to get the notes from the niece
AITA?

EDIT: I talked to my niece, she would ""rent out"" the nites for a month for my mom to copy, but i made a mistake of asking what did my brother specifically need (niece has all of my highschool notes) and she said ""your notes from this teacher"", after asking her again she said she didnt wanna argue and if i didnt want to give the notes i shouldnt say anything to her
EDIT2: she said that she needs them to help my brother study/write essays so she doesn't need to read the whole book, because i never help him (she asks me to go help him, i ask him what he needs me to do and he says ""idk i don't think i have a problem"")",0.0,-0.0016003263,0,1

For the last few weekends we have spent every day out and since the weather's good, it's fine.
Today I wanted to stay in, so we made plans to stay home, I was supposed to make dinner.
My partner was working a few hours today so when he came home around 6pm, I had started on dinner.

I then said that I was hoping to stay in and he said - fine, we don't have to go.
But the problem is, our daughter heard all this and she was already packing her little bag of toys and talking about seeing her friend, so when my partner, her dad said - we will stay home, cause mommy doesn't want to go, she started to cry.

My partner couldn't drive, he had 2 beers so they couldn't just go by themselves.

71,1fb9nt7,AITA for telling my little sister she’s insane for taking the door off of her daughter’s bedroom door as punishment? ,"I (34f) told my little sister (32f) that she was turning into our mentally unstable mother and was ruining her relationship with her daughter, Sydney (12yrs); just like our mother did with us. 

For context, Sydney is a really good girl. She’s homeschooled, very sheltered, heavily involved in girl Scouts etc. My sister controls literally every aspect of her life. Sydney has been “acting out” lately ex. Saying “No” to chores, and refusing to cooperate. Something I think is pretty normal for this age (I have 4 kids, 3 of which have gone through puberty). It’s obvious to me Sydney is acting out as a way to establish some independence and doesn’t have the tools to be able to express this need to my sister. Defiance is obviously something that needs to be addressed, but I think my sister would have a much better outcome with a compassionate conversation with Sydney. I know it’s not my place, but I believe with my whole heart that it’s time for her to let Sydney know she is so proud of her and trusts her to do her best to make good choices, and is going to be giving her more freedoms to positively reinforce her good choices, not the opposite. ALSO, two days after this whole ordeal, Sydney started her first period so I know this was all likely a hormonal surge and should have been met with compassion, not anger and punishment. 

Anyway, Sydney didn’t want to go to girl scouts (she had to compete against the other girls (sprinting I think) for a badge and was too embarrassed at the thought of losing, so she flat out refused to go). My sister was so upset with her. She didn’t ask her why she didn’t want to go, she just became really heated and things somehow escalated to the point where my sister took away all of Sydney’s privileges (electronics, phone, even books!) and told her she was only allowed to leave her bedroom to go to the bathroom. The next day when my sister was bringing Sydney her lunch, she caught her reading and my sister lost her mind. She threw Sydneys lunch on her bed and said “the next step is calling the police, and trust me your treatment here is far better than treatment you’ll receive in jail!”. Sydney responded through tears, “OK call them!” So my sister walked away while pretending to call the police. When she came back, she removed Sydney’s door from her bedroom and said that the police told her to do that first, and the next step was jail. 

I honestly feel like this is borderline abusive. My sister and I have always been very close and promised to let each other know if we were turning into our mom.

74,1fb8wnb,AITA for inviting my brother's ex on our road trip?,"I (23F) have two brothers - Luca (27M) and Matt (25M). Growing up my family spent most summers with my mother's best friend's family. She has a daughter, Alissa (25F), and a son, Eric (28M).

This year we decided to go another road trip since it's been a while since we've all spent summer together. It wasn't strictly agreed that it would just be the 5 of us but I think Alissa assumed it would be.

So here's where I may have messed up - I invited Luca's ex, Elena (27F). They broke up over 3 years ago but her dad is our dad's best friend so we still see each other regularly. Elena joined us on a few road trips growing up so my dad asked her directly if she was going with us this year. To avoid the awkwardness I invited her. I thought she would say no but her dad was pushing her to go so she accepted.

Her invite was very last minute but I did let Luca know immediately. He wasn't happy about it but he also didn't want me to uninvite her because it would've caused issues with our dad. 

I let the others know a few days before the trip and from the start Alissa wasn't happy about her coming. She wanted me to uninvite her but instead of coming out and directly saying that she was making excuses about how we had already pre-booked all of our accommodation and activities. The accommodation didn't end up being an issue as Elena mostly shared with me or Luca. For some of the activities we couldn't get another ticket for her so me and Matt chose to sit out a few times so it wasn't a big deal.

Even though Elena being there didn't have any negative impact on Alissa she was acting like her mere presence had ruined everything for her. If I'm being honest, Alissa was the one who ended up ruining the trip. She was cold to Elena from the start and would intentionally try to stir the conversation to things the 5 of us had done together as kids to exclude Elena. She said it was weird Elena had wanted to go on holiday with her ex multiple times in front of  everyone which just made things awkward. She kept trying to get the guys to agree that they wished Elena wasn't there, especially Luca. Whenever me or Matt would choose to sit out she'd make a huge deal about it even though it had nothing to do with her.

  
The thing that annoyed me the most was how she kept going on and on about how Luca was supposedly so uncomfortable with Elena being there, which was a huge exaggeration. Things were awkward between them at first but eventually they both relaxed and it was fine. 

The two of us had so many arguments and it completely ruined the mood of the trip. I was so fed up that when she directly told me I shouldn't have invited Elena I said something hurtful that I regret - I told her she was only upset Elena was here because Luca wasn't giving her any attention. Alissa has always had a huge crush on Luca so I knew it was a low blow before I even said it. We're home now and she's blocked me everywhere and when I asked Eric if she was okay he told me she said I was dead to her which I think is a bit overdramatic.

75,1fb8uku,AITAH for calling my mom heartless over a turtle? ,"1 (22F), am a reptile lover and happy mother to three little turtles who i love very very dearly. This morning, i woke up to one of my turtles having some health complications. It was by no means major, but it was enough to be a cause for concern.
 i went inside and quickly called our nearest vet specializing in exotic pets. I had no intentions of immediately bringing her in yet, because the situation wasn't an emergency, but i would naturally feel more comfortable getting input from a professional, even if over the phone. After getting off the phone, my mom called me irresponsible, saying i couldn't afford the vet visit. I hadn't even scheduled an appointment yet. I'm well aware of what's in my bank, and i know it would be enough to pay for a checkup. I'd just have to sacrifice some of my fun money, which I'd be willing to do. I explained this, and she continued to attempt to shutdown the conversation, saying that i couldn't change her mind and that she didn't think a turtle was worth taking to a vet. 
Both her and my father think that taking my animal to the vet would be irresponsible, and that it would be more responsible to, in my mothers words ""just let the turtle pass away if it's the time."" But my turtle is still young, and not anywhere an age where this would be considered a natural death.
I asked my mom if she'd feel the same way about our two family dogs, and she immediately said it wasn't the same, because my turtles are not the same as the dogs.
I told her that she's being disrespectful to my relationship with my reptiles, because my love for them is equal to the love she has for the dogs, and asked her to try to have empathy and understand why i might be concerned. She said that her and i are never going to see eye to eye, and that she's being respectful simply by letting the turtles live on our back porch. I have always and always will cover expenses for my animals, and have never asked anyone to cover the cost for something i deem to be my responsibility. But her getting upset with me over valuing my animals health angered me.
Here's where i may be the asshole. In the midst of the argument, i snapped and told her there must be something seriously messed up in her head if she can't possibly understand what my turtles mean to me. She said me saying that was cruel and rude. Maybe it was, but i think it was a justified statement. 
the thing that bothers me the most in all of this is her inability to empathize with my love for my animals. I'm not asking her to love them the way i do. I'm just asking her to understand that i love them. I know if one of them were to pass away, I'd be devastated, and knowing how past situations have gone, most likely treated like a crazy person for even properly grieving them. But i don't even want it to get to that point. Am i losing my mind here?

I'm well aware of what's in my bank, and i know it would be enough to pay for a checkup. I'd just have to sacrifice some of my fun money, which I'd be willing to do. I explained this, and she continued to attempt to shutdown the conversation, saying that i couldn't change her mind and that she didn't think a turtle was worth taking to a vet. 
Both her and my father think that taking my animal to the vet would be irresponsible, and that it would be more responsible to, in my mothers words ""just let the turtle pass away if it's the time."" But my turtle is still young, and not anywhere an age where this would be considered a natural death.
I asked my mom if she'd feel the same way about our two family dogs, and she immediately said it wasn't the same, because my turtles are not the same as the dogs.
I told her that she's being disrespectful to my relationship with my reptiles, because my love for them is equal to the love she has for the dogs, and asked her to try to have empathy and understand why i might be concerned. She said that her and i are never going to see eye to eye, and that she's being respectful simply by letting the turtles live on our back porch. I have always and always will cover expenses for my animals, and have never asked anyone to cover the cost for something i deem to be my responsibility. But her getting upset with me over valuing my animals health angered me.
Here's where i may be the asshole. In the midst of the argument, i snapped and told her there must be something seriously messed up in her head if she can't possibly understand what my turtles mean to me. She said me saying that was cruel and rude. Maybe it was, but i think it was a justified statement. 
the thing that bothers me the most in all of this is her inability to empathize with my love for my animals. I'm not asking her to love them the way i do. I'm just asking her to understand that i love them. I know if one of them were to pass away, I'd be devastated, and knowing how past situations have gone, most likely treated like a crazy person for even properly grieving them. But i don't even want it to get to that point. Am i losing my mind here?

76,1fb8q7m,AITA for wanting some alone time for myself?,"I’m (17F) struggling with finding a space to myself in my crowded house, which I share with my parents, two younger brothers (6 and 4), grandparents, aunt, uncle, and cousins. My dad (40M) constantly scolds me for using my laptop during the day when my brothers are awake. They’re young and don’t pay attention to their surroundings, but I need my laptop plugged in because the battery has been messed up for about a year. I've had it since COVID, and it’s essential for my schoolwork and hobbies like writing stories.

The only spot I have in the house is my bunk bed, but my dad refused to put a power outlet near it, fearing I’d become addicted to the laptop. Even though my mom tried to convince him, he won’t budge. This forces me to wait until my brothers are asleep to get anything done.

I started using the living room when my brothers were awake because I could set up my laptop at the dinner table and not disturb anyone. However, my aunt gets upset and tells me to move because my uncle-in-law needs the table to eat, even though I always make sure to go when no one’s around. I can't go to another room because my brothers will follow me, and they’re hard to keep calm in one place. I understand my aunt might just want time alone with her husband, but it’s not like I’m there forever.

I’ve tried explaining to my dad that there’s nowhere else for me to work, but he won’t listen. He thinks I’ll get addicted, and honestly, I kind of worry about that too. He won’t let me go out with friends, have them over, or even have privacy if they did come over. Online communication is pretty much my only way to stay connected with friends.

On top of that, I’m not allowed to stay up past midnight, even if I have urgent assignments. My dad always tells me to be in bed before he gets home, regardless of the reason.

Recently, my aunt asked me why I keep using the living room, knowing people will come out to eat. I didn’t respond because it hurt, but I had my reasons—my mom came into our room, and my brothers followed her, so I needed somewhere safe to use my laptop. Someone suggested I calmly explain the situation to my aunt, but I’ve always struggled to stand up for myself, partly because I was raised to believe girls shouldn’t have opinions.

It feels like my only refuge is this malfunctioning laptop. I’m not allowed to go out, I’m unemployed, and I can’t even help with housework because they insist I focus on my studies.

77,1fb8oaq,WIBTA if I told my best friend how I really feel about her continuing to cancel plans?,"So I’m 16F and I’m gonna use a fake name cause saying she is annoying. My childhood best friend Katie, 16F, keeps cancelling our plans. Now if this happened once, even twice I’d say fine whatever things happen. But it’s adding up now and starting to make me resent her because I keep pretending like it’s fine. For backstory I moved out of our hometown just over 2 years ago and I live about 45 minutes away from Katie, so it’s hard to see each other anyways/have aligning schedules. I’m not expecting to see her every week, or hell even every month. I can drive as well. 

In 2024 alone, of our 6 plans to hangout only 2 of them actually happened. And when I say plans I don’t mean just mentioning we wanted to hang, no actual plans with the dates, times, who’s going where, who’s being picked up and whatever. And one of those plans that fell through was my 16th birthday. She cancelled day before and it made me so insanely depressed the day before my birthday and I honestly wanted to cancel it. But by this point I already knew when this kind of stuff was about to happen. 

For example we text on Snapchat, so it tells you that someone is typing. If I have plans with Katie the next day or within 2 days and she starts typing on Snapchat I immediately feel dread in my stomach because I know exactly what that message will be and I’m always right in the end. And it’s devastating. And I just tell her that it’s okay. But it’s not. 

So we made plans for me to pick her up from her dance company at 4pm today since it’s in my city. This was set in stone all good. Then at 2am last night I see “Katie is typing” and my heart just broke, because I KNEW that she was about to cancel on me. And she did. And her messaged, paraphrased was “i know im cancelling again, can we reschedule for next weekend, idk if i told u i switched schools and i’m at *** now & some girls asked if i could hangout tmrw and ik we had plans, but i hope u understand cause i wanna be able to make friends”. She completely disregards the fact that I also have a life, and other friends that I’d like to see, and then I can’t because she cancels day of or day before and everyone already has plans, effectively ruining my weekend. 

And Katie isn’t an unpopular girl. She’s rather popular actually and she has a lot of friends, from her old school, from dance, from childhood, etc. Her reason is not valid to me and I’m actually extremely pissed off. I want to tell her something along the lines of “No I’m probably not free next weekend, I have work on Friday till 9 and I’m gonna be exhausted, plus probably lots of homework. And I don’t understand, because I wouldn’t cancel my
plans with you to hangout with girls from school, and I don’t constantly cancel our plans. It ruins my weekend and I don’t have time to make plans with other people and this has happened multiple times this year.” But I feel like I might be an asshole. I’m just done pretending it’s fine cause it’s really not.

I(13F) got in trouble for using my phone during class one time.I obviously had 'the talk' with my Math Teacher, I apologized blah blah stuff like that.

2 weeks after that rolled by and a Grade 9/10 student came to our classroom and asked us if any of us would like to join the Seniors Scout Club(basically a club for boys/girls scouts but non-gendered), she handed us a paper for us to sign and left. Me, wanting to join, wrote my name down and my signature.

2 days later, our Teacher told us to meet him at out ICT(computer room) at 10:30 for a meeting. I found out that day that I needed to memorize our Scout Oath and Scout Law in order to gain approval and entey into the Club, and so I did. 10:30 came and I went downstairs.

I got into position and did out Scout sign, when I started, he kept interrupting me, saying how my position wasn't correct and saying my hand placement was wrong and so I fixed it(like what a normal student would).

My recitation was going well until I stuttered a little bit at the end, even then, I did pretty good.

But I might be an ass for it. So my family has always been big on home cooking and family meals. But when I was growing up none of us had any skills between us and the food was shit. I always tossed my home made lunch at school and took our free lunches. I used to sneak sandwiches when I was old enough and get rid of the evidence of me not eating dinner/lunch my parents prepared.

Eg of the bad cooking, soggy chicken and soggy (almost mush) veggies. Lumpy mashed potatoes. No seasoning on anything. Super dry beef with no seasoning. Potatoes that are waaaaay too soggy. Bacon that's basically raw.

When I was a teen one of my sisters, Eve, got really invested in cooking and she'd make us food twice a week and it was even worse than what we were normally given.  Other people avoided our house like the plague because nobody wanted to eat the food. I remember mom trying to invite a group of her friends over for something and they made excuses to go out to eat. 

Moving away from home to start in trade school I decided I needed to be able to cook some things well. I didn't want to always hate cooking because I was shit at it, I didn't want to waste money only ever buying takeout and I knew if I settled down with someone I wanted to be able to contribute equally. My other sister, Ash, also worked on her cooking skills and improved SO much.

My parents, Eve and my brothers? None of them have improved. But mom and Eve are by far the worst. As an adult I suggested we each bring something and stop the taking turns for 1 to cook everything each time and I was rejected. I brought my girlfriend with me a few times and she hated most of the food. I think some of my brothers are doing store bought stuff and passing it as theirs now. And she liked Ash's cooking. Ash was also in favor of changing the way we did dinner but nobody else wanted to take part in something like that.

In the end I started saying I was busy when dinners would come up and then I said it just didn't work for my schedule anymore. But my parents and some of my siblings aren't accepting that and they told me I should make my schedule work for this. I told them it just wouldn't work. They asked why and they pushed and pushed until I told them I don't want to subject myself to their cooking anymore because most of them can't cook, and for the longest time none of us could. I told them I know they were told this by others before and I was doing it now because I refused to pretend anymore.

They were so offended by my comments. Ash also spoke up and said she agreed. So she was also seen as the bad guy. They said we're getting too used to processed instead of home cooking and we should appreciate the time with our family and food is love and all that. They accused us of throwing away love and being rude about their skills.

Moving away from home to start in trade school I decided I needed to be able to cook some things well. I didn't want to always hate cooking because I was shit at it, I didn't want to waste money only ever buying takeout and I knew if I settled down with someone I wanted to be able to contribute equally. My other sister, Ash, also worked on her cooking skills and improved SO much.

My parents, Eve and my brothers? None of them have improved. But mom and Eve are by far the worst. As an adult I suggested we each bring something and stop the taking turns for 1 to cook everything each time and I was rejected. I brought my girlfriend with me a few times and she hated most of the food. I think some of my brothers are doing store bought stuff and passing it as theirs now. And she liked Ash's cooking. Ash was also in favor of changing the way we did dinner but nobody else wanted to take part in something like that.

In the end I started saying I was busy when dinners would come up and then I said it just didn't work for my schedule anymore. But my parents and some of my siblings aren't accepting that and they told me I should make my schedule work for this. I told them it just wouldn't work. They asked why and they pushed and pushed until I told them I don't want to subject myself to their cooking anymore because most of them can't cook, and for the longest time none of us could. I told them I know they were told this by others before and I was doing it now because I refused to pretend anymore.

They were so offended by my comments. Ash also spoke up and said she agreed. So she was also seen as the bad guy. They said we're getting too used to processed instead of home cooking and we should appreciate the time with our family and food is love and all that. They accused us of throwing away love and being rude about their skills.

83,1fb88ct,AITA for telling my parents to think about whether they want to stay with me after my mom gave me the silent treatment?,"I (F31) live on another continent from my parents. We have a rocky relationship, because my mother is controlling and throws fits when she doesn't get her way. My dad is unfortunately an enabler and goes for ""It's your fault, you should apologize for upsetting your mother"" every time. Recently they came to stay in my 400 sqft studio apartment with me, despite me saying they might be more comfortable in a hotel. For cultural reasons (Asian family), my mom thinks that she needs to come rearrange my kitchen and cook food for me (she gives me no choice in this) and that I should be grateful and revert to the powerlessness of my childhood. For example, she decides what I eat for every meal, I get questioned about when I'm leaving the house and when I'm coming back etc.

I came home from work yesterday and the water was out without warning. I got slightly upset as my landlord has been guilty of doing this kind of thing before, without 24-hour notice. As I was putting in the work order, I muttered under my breath about how annoying it was and I was clearly frustrated. My mom started telling me to calm down, why do I always get so worked up about these things. I was already frustrated, so I said (calmly) ""Don't tell me to calm down. I have the right to be upset about this. My feelings are valid."" I did not raise my voice.

84,1fb6ynn,AITA for taking away one of my sons' bedroom?,"I have two adult sons that are 10 months apart. They are now 21 & 20. They are half-brothers.

For over a decade I have lived in the same 3-bedroom house where they've each had their own room. The boys have always fought a lot and I specifically upgraded to a 3-bedroom so that when I had custody of both they would have their own rooms to get away from one another.

My 20-year-old is in college in a different state. My 21-year-old moved out of his mom's place at 18 to live with me full-time, before then moving out to live on his own a little over a year ago in a different city. He did not go to college and works a full-time job. However, he's still spent a handful of nights at my house since moving out.

Up until recently, I've left both their bedrooms as is. However, I work from home more now and my girlfriend moved in with me at the beginning of the summer. I decided to turn my eldest son's room into my office but include a pull-out couch for my son or any other guests to use.

I texted my son to let him know, he still had a few belongings that I have put in the basement. I told him he can pick them up at some point or I could keep them in the basement. He did not seem to mind at that time.

However, last weekend he visited me for the first time since I switched things around. In person he seemed less okay with the whole thing. His main issue was that his brother kept his room and I only changed his room. He says that I should turn my other son's room into a guest room so that he and other family can use it instead of the couch. He says it's unfair that he was singled out instead of his brother and thinks it's because I prefer my younger son for going to college.

I told him that his brother still uses his room more than he does. My 20-year-old spent most of his summer break staying at my house, it is unclear if he'd want to use it again next summer. On top of that he still has a lot of his belongings at my house as he only takes a limited amount of stuff with him to college. He also spent more of his childhood living with me than my older son, so the bedroom has been his primary bedroom vs my older son who used it every other weekend. My older only left a few random belongings behind when he moved out, the room was mostly sparse.

86,1fb6ibr,"AITA for ""ruining"" my friends vacation?","I (F38) just got back from a vacation with two of my longtime friends, ""Kate"" (F40) and ""Mary"" (F38). I've known them both since university, and we've always been close. The three of us had been planning this Bali trip for a few months, along with our husbands and their kids (they both have children under 5, while my husband ""Jake"" (M45) and I are childfree). We agreed to split the cost of a four-bedroom villa three ways, and everything seemed fine at first.

Jake and I arrived in Bali earlier than the rest of the group because we had different flights. Once we got to the villa, we waited to choose rooms with our friends and didn’t mind when they both chose the ones with ensuites. We had a great time during the trip—Jake and I did some couples activities (massages, hiking, dinners), but we also spent time with Kate and Mary and their families whenever it worked for everyone. To be nice, I even surprised them with massages to give them a break.

The only thing that made me uncomfortable was that whenever I ordered a drink (a cocktail before dinner, or a glass of wine with meals), I'd get comments like ""Oh, you're drinking again?"" For context, I’m a social drinker and don't drink often, but we were on vacation, and I didn’t think it was a big deal, especially since our husbands were drinking too. I just ignored the comments so I could enjoy the trip.

On the last night, Jake and I made plans with the guys to go out, and Kate and Mary said they were staying in to pack. Jake convinced me to join him, and since it was the last night of our vacation, I didn’t want to stay in either. We went out and had a great time. We got home at 1am and I passed out straight after. The next morning was a bit chaotic with everyone packing and checking out, but we all made it back home without issue. We had booked business class seats back so we were separated during the flight and said quick goodbyes at the airport.

A week after returning home, I got a long text from Kate saying that both she and Mary wanted to reduce contact with me because I had ""ruined their vacation."" They mentioned several things, like me drinking every night, that I wasn’t acting like a “girls’ girl,” that I booked different flights, didn't hang out with them enough, and that I was selfish for not helping with their kids. She even said I was just focused on partying and not acting my age.This message really hurt me. 

I cried after reading it, and I honestly don’t know what to think. I thought I was just enjoying my vacation, but clearly, they had a very different view. I haven’t responded yet, and my husband has been asking what’s bothering me, but I don’t know what to say.

AITA for how I acted during the trip?

Reading through the responses and seeing how many of you are upset on my behalf has made me reflect on how I initially planned to handle things.

I don’t want my bf to miss his grandmothers birthday and I want to be there too so I decided on celebrating today, I just wanted to do dinner and something with my friends and bf included afterwards but my friends all canceled on me so it would just be me and my bf. Then I’d be sleeping at his house afterwards.

Last night he asked if he could go out for his friends birthday tonight, someone he isn’t very close with, and I said I thought we were doing something for my birthday. He said we were and that he wouldn’t be going out til later and after 11. I reminded him that I was supposed to sleep over and he said I still could, but I said I didn’t want to sleep over just to be by myself all night.

It isn’t like a huge argument or anything, but I can tell he has been a bit annoyed by me and he joked that his friends are insisting I’m being a bit of an AH considering I’m moving in with him in a couple of weeks and will have “endless sleepovers”, and can sacrifice one night.

89,1fb5yey,AITA for taking over MOH duties when MOH/bride's sister did not?,"I, 28F, grew up being BFFs with sisters, both 28F. We were close and accepted me as family.

In early 2023, one of the sisters announced her engagement. I was thrilled. Myself and her sister already knew we would be the bridesmaids, her sister being MOH.

To give the MOH some context, a few months before her sister's engagement, MOH and her BF had a very bad break up, whom she met the same time her sister met her BF.  After this, MOH went straight back out into dating. She would also act out in public where kids she knew from her job saw her. She would also expect her parents to pay for everything and throw tantrums.

 

As the wedding grew closer, I urged MOH to start a plan on what to do for her own sister's party. She just shrugged it off and said she would think about it.

 

4 weeks before the wedding, nothing had been done. When I urged her again, she acted as if it was no big of a deal.

I decided to reach out to bride. The bride then admitted to me that she knew her sister was not doing the job, and was happy that I was.

 

1 week before wedding, the MOH knew I was planning the party and everything else.

 

On the day our flight went out, MOH started complaining about her unfair life. I snapped.

I told her I was angry with her behaviour towards the wedding and told her off for not stepping up.

Not great timing I admit.

 

Next day, I mentioned I needed to go shopping for the bachelorette party items. The bride and groom were shocked when MOH refused to help. Thankfully, the bride and groom stepped up and took me shopping, where I paid for everything.

We were now staying at the hotel - the FOB paying for the room MOH and I were staying in. I was prepared to pay my half of the room, but MOH was not, sounding rather entitled how her father should pay.

The bachelorette was great. Everyone knew I was the one who had planned and paid for it all,  making things with MOH more tense.

 

On the day of the wedding, MOH was happy to being pampered, but did not want to do her MOH duties. During the ceremony, MOH proceeded to speak while the celebrant was talking and during the vows. At the reception, she partied hard.

 

Weeks after the wedding, MOH told me she wanted space. 20 yrs friendship, done.

She decided that I was rude and negative, that I labelled her 'lazy', and she was hurt for not having the final say in everything. She unfriended me and blocked me on all social media.

 

10 months later, we have not spoken.

I am still friends with my other BFF, happy with my actions at the wedding.

I understand I went too far, and it was not my place to step in the way I did, but I stand by the fact that her lack of care towards her sister as MOH was ridiculous.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-07,"AITA for taking over MOH duties when MOH/bride's sister did not? I, 28F, grew up being BFFs with sisters, both 28F. We were close and accepted me as family.

In early 2023, one of the sisters announced her engagement. I was thrilled. Myself and her sister already knew we would be the bridesmaids, her sister being MOH.

To give the MOH some context, a few months before her sister's engagement, MOH and her BF had a very bad break up, whom she met the same time her sister met her BF.  After this, MOH went straight back out into dating. She would also act out in public where kids she knew from her job saw her. She would also expect her parents to pay for everything and throw tantrums.

 

As the wedding grew closer, I urged MOH to start a plan on what to do for her own sister's party. She just shrugged it off and said she would think about it.

 

4 weeks before the wedding, nothing had been done. When I urged her again, she acted as if it was no big of a deal.

I decided to reach out to bride. The bride then admitted to me that she knew her sister was not doing the job, and was happy that I was.

 

1 week before wedding, the MOH knew I was planning the party and everything else.

 

On the day our flight went out, MOH started complaining about her unfair life. I snapped.

I told her I was angry with her behaviour towards the wedding and told her off for not stepping up.

Not great timing I admit.

 

Next day, I mentioned I needed to go shopping for the bachelorette party items. The bride and groom were shocked when MOH refused to help. Thankfully, the bride and groom stepped up and took me shopping, where I paid for everything.

We were now staying at the hotel - the FOB paying for the room MOH and I were staying in. I was prepared to pay my half of the room, but MOH was not, sounding rather entitled how her father should pay.

The bachelorette was great. Everyone knew I was the one who had planned and paid for it all,  making things with MOH more tense.

90,1fb5oh3,AITA for refusing to throw away a bunch of my clothes because my partner thinks I have too many?,"My partner (41M) and I (34F) moved into a new home recently. He is paying for the home as well as the vast majority of our expenses- he is well off and my net worth is about 3% of his for context.

In our home, we have a walk in closet. Currently, I  use 60% of the closet, he uses 20% and 20% is unused and available for him to use. In addition to the closet space in our bedroom, we currently have two guest bedrooms with large closets as well. Prior to purchasing our new home, we lived separately. When moving here, I was very deliberate about which of my clothes I was bringing and used it as an opportunity to get rid of a ton of items of clothes that I no longer want.

My partner has said to me ""Hey, I want us to go through your clothes and decide which ones we're keeping and which ones you don't wear or use and we should get rid of."" I responded ""Ok we can, but I already did that, and I only brought over the clothes I know I want to keep, so I don't think this is necessary and won't lead to me getting rid of them."" He responded that he still wanted to go through them, it's fine if we don't end up getting rid of anything, but also that ""he doesn't want to bring junk into our new home"" and that I ""have too many clothes"". He also offered that we could go through his things and do the same, but I said that I don't have any problem with how many clothes he has and I'm not concerned about what he keeps/doesn't keep.

To me, this whole thing is unnecessary and I don't even see why it needs to be an issue. We have the space, I already did what he is asking me to do on my own, and also I'm having a hard time seeing why this even matters/is an issue. This isn't the first time this has come up- he's brought it up multiple times, leading to a similar conversation though last night's was especially vitriolic. I got upset about it when we were discussing it last night and said ""why can't I bring what I want into our new home?"" and he said ""Fine I don't care bring anything and why don't you pay for everything too?"" and then he left because he needed a break.

My dad’s sister was also at the party and told me he spoke to her and was pissed off that we didn’t invite him at all and didn’t want him there. I called him again to ask if he was coming and his response was “coming where?! If you fucking wanted me there you would have invited me” to which I explained that’s why I sent someone to get him. But he hung up on me. So I texted him that this was for mom and for him to please come for my mom’s sake. He did show up but not for good, he came in to the party screaming that we waited until the party was over to invite him (we obviously didn’t because the party was still going on) saying we waited two hours after it started to tell him (my boyfriend was there to pick him up FIVE MINUTES after it started) and after he was done screaming in the middle of the party he left again and my mom went to the bathroom crying. Then after we got home he was still making up those lies about how we didn’t invite him at all or until after the party was over.

I understand he may be hurt and I do want to apologize for not asking if he wanted to be inside when she walked in. But I find it pretty hard to apologize when he’s been screaming at us, not acting like someone who is hurt.

92,1fb5gy2,AITAH for talking to another guy two months before my bf and I became official ,"And was he justified in kicking me out of our home? 

I f22 and my now maybe ex bf m38 had a huge fight this morning. I went out yesterday with some friends and got home at about 11:30 Pm, his phone is broken so I can't really tell him anything and he works long hours so I didn't have the chance to see him before everyone wanted to go. 

Yesterday morning was perfect, everything was normal we even made love, and last night when I got home everything seemed fine, he was just groggy so he opened the door for me and went straight back to bed. 

Our relationship was rocky from the start, with him always telling me not to catch feelings for him and that he just wants company and to hookup, however I did make my feelings know about two months ago to which he still insisted he wasn't ready for a ready relationship but would still really like my company. 

I was still falling in love with him, and I was in hospital for a while in July, and during my stay in hospital is when I made my feelings known. 

So I was flirting with this other guy, we'll call him Dylan, but Dylan lives about 3 hours away from me and we never even met, yes the chats were spicy, but my now bf at that time still didn't want anything serious with me so I thought it was okay as I felt stupid for pining after a man that insists he doesn't want me. 

In May, m38 and I went no contact for about two weeks, (I came home really panicked and a bit tipsy because something traumatic happened on a girls night out and I accidentally stomped mud all over his house in my panic) his birthday was during that time and I'd already bought him present, I'd texted him every day without fail begging him to talk to me but never got a response. feeling despondent, I began speaking to Dylan a bit more as he's very interested in me and I assumed that m38 was really never going to talk to me again. This is relevant to what happened this morning. 

Anyways, fast forward to July 21st, I'm discharged from hospital and it was my birthday coming up on the 25th.

I went to straight to M38s house after I got home and everything was great. He was being so much more caring and attentive. And on the 23rd of July is when I last spoke to Dylan. A few days after my birthday due to issues at home and circumstances i ended up living with M38. 

About a week ago he told me we're in a serious relationship and he loves me (albeit in a very roundabout way) and everything has been amazing up until this morning.

Now this morning, my alarm went off at 5 AM, so I put it off and set it for 5:30 AM so he could sleep a bit extra before work. At 5:30 he got up and had a cigarettes, I'd been awake the whole time and offered him a cup of coffee, to which he very rudely responded that he can make his own cup of coffee and went back to sleep (this so very abnormal) thereafter, I fell asleep after he did, and about an hour later once he was ready for work he shoved me awake and started screaming at me to pack my shit and be out of his house by the time he gets home. 
He began screaming that all women were the same and that he'd eff me up etc. Because I was crying and begging him not to do this, not because I have nowhere to go btw but because I genuinely love him and I was so happy. 
I followed him go the car and he pushed me all the way back into the house, he was super angry this is only the second time I've seen him like this. 

Was his reaction justified? I mean, I even stopped talking to Dylan way before he confessed his feelings for the sole reason I knew I was serious about him and I wanted to make it work regardless of what he says, I just want to be around him, even if it's not official I took it as a somewhat serious relationship. 
Also he obviously read it sometime while I was sleeping, went back to bed, and then reacted that way in the morning because there's no other time he could've without me being there. I have nothing to hide and ik he knows my password despite him always pretending to forget it a very simple one. 
But his reaction was so intense as though he'd just read it??? Despite having time to sleep on it or ponder it. He also brought up that I spoke to Dylan on M38s birthday, but we were no contact on his side at the time?? So I don't understand why he was upset?

93,1fb5b4p,AITA for making a big deal about my roommate having a new guy sleepover?,"I (32M, gay) live with my roommate (30M, gay) in a two-bedroom apartment. Shortly before our lease started, he began dating someone new. That relationship didn’t last long due to some red flags in his then-boyfriend’s behavior.

A few days ago, my roommate showed me some Tinder profiles of guys he matched with. I had actually encouraged him to get back on the apps, as he often struggles to move on from relationships. He seemed open to the idea of taking things slow, which both I and his friends had advised.

Enter his latest match (29M). They hit it off quickly, spending an entire day FaceTiming. While I thought it was cute, I kept reminding my roommate to “pump the brakes.” The day after they first met (two nights ago), my roommate ended up spending the night at the guy’s place, even though he’d initially said he wouldn’t. I reminded him the next day that he should stick to his convictions and mentioned it’s risky to stay overnight with someone you’ve just met.

That evening, I found out the guy was coming over to our place to watch football, which neither of us really care about. The guy was loud and yelled at the TV, which isn’t something my roommate or I do, but I didn’t mind too much since I’ve experienced that with family members. My roommate was trying to shush him, so I appreciated that he was being considerate.

As the night wore on, I started getting the sense that this guy might spend the night. I texted my roommate, “He isn’t staying the night, is he?” but didn’t get an immediate response. Two hours later, I sent a “🤨” emoji. My roommate replied, jokingly telling me to let it go and that they were “being good.” I responded that I wasn’t comfortable with a stranger spending the night, especially since they had just met. His response was basically confusion, so I reiterated that I wouldn’t bring someone home for an overnight stay unless we both knew the person well. I figured the decision had already been made, so I locked my door and texted my roommate, “But you do you, goodnight.” I had a hard time falling asleep after that.

94,1fb4wom,AITA for picking a fight with my roommate to prove a point?,"I (28,F) have issues with my roommate (23,F) on the guest policy. We had one but she had always been the one to break it lie about it. Or blame me because I couldn’t give her a ride (she doesn’t drive) so she HAD to stay at the house.

Now, a year+ later, no more policy and I like it a lot better. BUT roommate doesn’t. She’s stated my partner (30,F) is there “a lot”. Admittedly, she is there a lot. About 3-4 days a week. We stay in my room unless it’s to cook and she does laundry at her own place. I also have my own bathroom.

Before people ask, we plan on living together next year. Lease is up in June. I have traumas around living with partners so we’ve spent more time together to see if I’d get comfortable with the idea of living together, and I have. It’s been helpful to bridge the gap between living separately and together with this kind of in-between stage.

Roommate has a couple of boyfriends that spend the night (both mid20s, M) and never tells me when they’re there. I’ve never minded. It’s her business and they’re nice enough to me and respectful of the house. She just asks that I don’t mention one in front of the other as they don’t know about each other. Again, not my business. She also never cares about other roommates having boyfriends over. She never asks about it, which I confirmed with them. It seems to be just me and my girlfriend.
I’ve never asked her about boyfriends or when they’re over. But I’m asked quite often. “How many days a week is your she here? How long is she here today? Will she be here if you aren’t?” I work nights and she’s slept in my bed before while I was at work. BUT it’s rare and she doesn’t leave my room. Roommate tells me “it’s a lot” and she didn’t agree to live with my partner.

Now to where I might be the asshole. Yesterday roommate came home from work and it seemed like boyfriend 1 had already been there. So I asked her, “Hey, was boyfriend 1 here while you were at work?” (not in front of him). And she responds “no, why?” To which I say, “oh, okay never mind”. I start to walk away but she gets defensive and asks “are you going to ask me that every time now? He wasn’t here so what’s the problem?” I answer back that there isn’t a problem, I believe her, and I won’t ask again. I’m heading out for work so I tell her to have a good day and I leave. I think a part of me did ask this intentionally. If she says yes, she did something she asked me not to. Or, she didn’t but is mad I asked and now I can point out the irony of it bothering her when she asks me all the time. I know it’s petty, but a part of me still wants to die on the “you’re a hypocrite” hill if she brings it up later.
I know I’m too old for this shit at 28. BUT am I the asshole?

Edit: we still live together because my move out of state fell through last minute and I'm waiting another year. I had to help some family. I needed the cheap rent and didn't want to try to rush to find another place so I stayed. Though, this is the worst it's ever been for both of us and it's definitely time to set aside our differences or part ways.

Will she be here if you aren’t?” I work nights and she’s slept in my bed before while I was at work. BUT it’s rare and she doesn’t leave my room. Roommate tells me “it’s a lot” and she didn’t agree to live with my partner.

Now to where I might be the asshole. Yesterday roommate came home from work and it seemed like boyfriend 1 had already been there. So I asked her, “Hey, was boyfriend 1 here while you were at work?” (not in front of him). And she responds “no, why?” To which I say, “oh, okay never mind”. I start to walk away but she gets defensive and asks “are you going to ask me that every time now? He wasn’t here so what’s the problem?” I answer back that there isn’t a problem, I believe her, and I won’t ask again. I’m heading out for work so I tell her to have a good day and I leave. I think a part of me did ask this intentionally. If she says yes, she did something she asked me not to. Or, she didn’t but is mad I asked and now I can point out the irony of it bothering her when she asks me all the time. I know it’s petty, but a part of me still wants to die on the “you’re a hypocrite” hill if she brings it up later.
I know I’m too old for this shit at 28. BUT am I the asshole?

Edit: we still live together because my move out of state fell through last minute and I'm waiting another year. I had to help some family. I needed the cheap rent and didn't want to try to rush to find another place so I stayed. Though, this is the worst it's ever been for both of us and it's definitely time to set aside our differences or part ways. ",1.0,0.07716445,0,0
95,1fb442w,AITAH for telling my dad his expectations are to high?,"Hi, for some context I'm 14  F with divorced parents and an older sister 17 F, living at two houses for equal time, because of this i struggle with origination but overall I try my best to be tidy . At my mums house the rules are that i must have my room tidy (i.e. bed made, floor cleared and bins emptied) before i go out to see friends, and the my room must be clean (i.e. dusted and hooved) before i go back to my dads (every 3-4 days). 

However at my dads house he expects my room to be tidy 100% of the time, even to the extent of putting my school bag neatly in the corner of my room, and lining my extra pillows up before i go to sleep. every time his standards are not met he explains to me how easy it is just to keep my room tidy, that he does it and I'm expected to as well.

I understand that it is his house, but i am finding really difficult to be perfect and it is leading me to feel like I'm not good enough when i can't meet his standards.

i talked to him about it after i came down at 11 after waking up (on week days i have to wake up at 5:45 so i like to lie in on weekends). The conversation got heated with me shouting and him expressing that he also thinks waking up at 10 and not having tidied my room isn't good enough. It's my first weekend coming back to school and i explained i believed it was normal for teenagers to  lie in and be a bit messy.

i fully feel that his standards are making me want to spend less time downstairs and more time in my room where i can't be criticized and especially as he treats my untidiness (some pillows and clothes on the floor) to the same extent as my sisters (makeup stains, wardrobe a mess and food crumbs everywhere).

Ultimately i just want to understand if I'm just being overdramatic and should just keep my mouth shut about my dads rules, or if i should try and talk to him again and make him understand my point of view, so please parents and teenagers or reddit help me out!!",Not the A-hole,2024-09-07,"AITAH for telling my dad his expectations are to high?

96,1fb4314,AITA for refusing to babysit my dad's fiancée's kids during their wedding?,"My dad and his fiancée Kirsten (both late 30s) are getting married in January. Kirsten has three kids under 8. Dad has me (17m). My mom died 11 years ago. Kirsten's ex husband is alive but doesn't play a role in the lives of their kids (except child support which is apparently taken from his income because he wasn't paying). Her kids don't remember their dad and so dad and Kirsten are hoping dad will become their new dad. I met Kirsten 4-5 months ago and her kids around the same time and given my age and the fact I did fine with just me and dad, I'm not looking for Kirsten to fill any sort of maternal or motherly role. I also don't think I'll be engaging with Kirsten's kids as a sibling. This upsets her because she wanted me to be the cool older sibling for them, and someone who might babysit on occasion. But mostly someone who'd make a point to spend time with them. But I'm not planning on spending too much time with them. I have plans for once I turn 18. My dad always knew this.

So this has fed into the whole babysitting the kids during the wedding stuff. Kirsten says since I won't be 18 when they get married and I'll still be living with my dad, I should be willing to monitor her kids throughout the wedding. My dad admitted she's hoping it makes me a little more willing to be someone to her kids. I said no when I was initially asked and I was clear with my no. Kirsten told me it wasn't like I was looking forward to the wedding anyway so why not agree to babysit. She told me it would give me the chance to bond with her kids. I said no. Dad said he'd pay me to do it if I was agreeable to money for it. But then Kirsten was saying it would be hurtful if I wouldn't do it as a favor to my growing family. Dad told her it was expecting a little too much. She argued that if I'm there, and still living with him, I should be willing, and that I seem so resistant to acting like a sibling that it's incredibly childish.

There was some more back and forth about it. Kirsten got really pissed when I said it again, as clearly as I could, that I won't babysit during the wedding. Dad said he'd pay for a sitter but Kirsten said I should really be more willing here. That dad and I don't have an awful relationship so why won't I give all this a chance and make the day less expensive and more of a happy memory for everyone.

97,1fb408w,AITA for telling my policewoman friend about my Gears of War Lancer replica?,"Hello everybody, I am a 17M, and Iive in Australia.

Yesterday, I got my Gears of War Lancer replica delivered, I had been saving for it for months, and I finally managed to buy it on Tuesday, and I got it delivered on Friday. I was extremely happy when I got it, and I still am extremely happy about how I have achieved probably my biggest savings goal this year.

I put the symbol of the police of my state on my Lancer (because I love the thought of the police carrying them for real), and I wore a shirt and hat I legally bought from them in the photos. The photos were fantastic, and everybody loved them and was happy for me and proud of me, except my policewoman friend (53F).

She told me she found the photos offensive because she does not like guns (somewhat hypocritical, because she carries a real gun on-duty, even though she ain't got no choice), and she never directly said she was happy for me or proud of me. She is also aware that I love video games (especially Gears of War and Halo), but she does not understand what it is like to have an interest in video games and probably never will, and I don't mean that in a bad way, it is just the truth.

She lectured me about laws in my state that I cannot take the gun out in public; I already knew them, so her words did not make a difference. She thought that I could potentially bring the gun out in public, and I was shocked, because she knows me very well, and I have never expressed an intention to do anything similar to that.

She was also aware that I have been trying for months to save for my Lancer, and my family, other friends, and I are disappointed that she did not show much, if any, happiness or praise for me.

She messaged my mum later that night saying she understood that I was extremely excited about getting my Lancer, but she wanted me to know that I could not take it out in public. For context, I am autistic and I have ADD, but I am extremely intelligent, and I would know that already. Mum and dad were both working last night, and her actions really stressed mum, dad, and I out.

I messaged my policewoman friend and I apologized for offending her and she said it was okay but she was worried about me, and I asked her if she was worried about whether I was going to commit a crime, or if she was worried about how I feel, and she dodged the question and ended the conversation, saying she would talk to me later. I sent her a message explaining to her how she made my family and I feel yesterday earlier today, and she has not replied to me yet.

My family and other friends believe that I was right and that my policewoman friend was wrong. They believed that her reaction and concern was unwarranted, and I agree with them. I think her reaction was over the top, I would never use my replica Lancer to scare the public, and with how well she knows me, she should have known that.

Thing is, I do not have time to myself since...idek.

After my tertiery studies, I got my first job. The job was hell. I quit and got forced into a profession I did not want since...forever. I bear with it till now because they kept mentioning how they don't have long lives anymore and that they want to see me secure a job before they pass away. By following their wish, there's a high chance of getting employed. That's what they believe.

I myself don't really want to live a long life but whatever.

So, I'm done with the practicum in the next two months, just in time to make full preparations for the vendor thingy. I was really excited for weeks until my parents turned me down.
I don't have the money, technically I do but it's for my whatever savings in the future they assume I'll live in. (they hold the card for that account because I can't be trusted to not spend money, I have two bank accs, I have freedom to use the other one for whatever)
So I got frustrated and upset and went to my room.

They kept pestering me to do my work despite knowing I was frustrated and upset, I bluntly refused and vocalised my refusal.

My mom then went upstairs and forced herself into my room and said she wanted to accompany me to do my work. Which we've tried before but I couldn't stand it and we already went through this before! It was bad! So idk why she keeps trying!!!

I can't work with her in the room. I do feel lonely when I do my work but when I ask for company, they'd refused in the past. Now, they're forcing themselves when I refuse! I feel so anxious!

She cried and screamed at me with a cracked voice, accusing me of 'always demanding things done your way!'  ('your' being mine).

I snapped back, ""my way??? Oh always *my* way???"" And just stormed back upstairs, back into my room.

I have cried and broken down the entirety of the last hour or so.

102,1fb3hme,AITA for contradicting my wife with regards to our niece?,"My(34m) wife(34)'s brother and his wife are currently in rehab. Their daughter(14) is staying with me and my wife.

I let the kid pick a book from the Simon and Schuster website as a birthday present(it's her favourite site for browsing for books). She picked a graphic novel but my wife strongly disagreed with the choice, since the product details say 'Ages 8-12.' She also said our niece is 'too old for comics anyway' and that 'reading graphic novels isn't actually reading.'

I pointed out that Simon and Schuster is an American company so they probably take mainly American kids into consideration. In other words, kids who speak English as their first language. Our niece isn't a native speaker of the language, so if at 14 she can read English on the same level as a 12 year old native English speaker it is a good thing.

I let the kid pick a book from the Simon and Schuster website as a birthday present(it's her favourite site for browsing for books). She picked a graphic novel but my wife strongly disagreed with the choice, since the product details say 'Ages 8-12.' She also said our niece is 'too old for comics anyway' and that 'reading graphic novels isn't actually reading.'

I pointed out that Simon and Schuster is an American company so they probably take mainly American kids into consideration. In other words, kids who speak English as their first language. Our niece isn't a native speaker of the language, so if at 14 she can read English on the same level as a 12 year old native English speaker it is a good thing.

103,1fb38fz,WIBTA if I told my mom no to her boyfriend staying the night?," I,(F19) live with my mom. I can't move out since I'm temporarily disabled, and she takes care of me. And my mom and I are pretty close already, she's a great parent and I love her.

About 4 years ago, Mom met Sal, who moved in with us about a year or so into their relationship. Long story short, he was a shitty guy. Turned to drugs and cheated a whole bunch, Emotionally fucked me up(my health was crashing at the time of their break up, and I was trying to take care of myself, and my mom at the same time, shit was rough). 2 years ago, Mom finally kicked Sal to the curb. He spent the next year and a half fucking with us(threats, fuckin with our car, etc. Cops was no help). So the wounds are still fresh.

Last week, Mom went on a date with her new boyfriend, Jack. Jack is OK, so far. I just met him for the first time tonight. She's went over to his house to stay the night before. But idk if I feel OK with him staying the night here yet. She's tried to mention it, and I told her maybe. I'm nervous purely because of Sal did in the past. I can't smell beer or it sends me into fight or flight(Sal drank a lot), and I don't like loud noises like yelling anymore because of Sal on top of a bunch of other stuff.

I want to make it clear that Jack has done NOTHING to me. He seems ok. Quiet, and socially awkward, but an OK guy. He makes mom happy which I'm happy about. I have 0 issues with him. It's just him staying the night is the issue. It just freaks me out for some reason. I'd be willing to revisit the idea of him spending the night in 5-6 months when I have a better chance at knowing him. 

Idk, WIBTA if I asked her to not let him spend the night?

Edit:
She's known Jack for 20+ years, I've just never met him since they was coworkers.

My parents live near us and my in-laws are visiting us from India, living with us for a few days. My parents wanted to come over today to say hi to my in-laws, my mom said she would be bringing over something she cooked. My in-laws obviously have jet lag and were still napping till late evening. I asked my parents what time they would be coming since they hadn’t let me know. My mom said they’d be over in 30min. I told my husband to wake his parents up and he was reluctant, saying he felt bad since they arrived just yesterday and hadn’t slept well the previous night. I told him my parents would be coming over soon, as agreed upon, and his parents probably shouldn’t sleep longer if they were to get out of jet lag and adjust to the time difference. He didn’t want to, tried calling my mom to explain it to her. She didn’t pick up. I texted her they’re asleep and asked her to come tomorrow morning. She didn’t respond but simply texted they’re on their way over.

They came over and as expected she expressed her frustration to my husband (his parents still asleep in their room). How she and my dad felt disrespected that my in-laws didn’t have the courtesy to wake up. I told her it wasn’t their fault. I explained if the tables were turned and it was my parents in jet lag and asleep, I wouldn’t wake them up either. They disagreed. The fact that my mom knew the situation, yet showed up and started creating a scene in our home, embarrassed me. She started raising her voice because she felt my husband was being rude to her. They walked out in anger. I couldn’t believe she started raising her voice, knowing my in-laws could hear.

Were my husband and I being unreasonable? I understand that my mom spent all day cooking an Indian dessert for my in-laws and we had agreed they would be coming over to say hi. But I also understand my husband’s pov to give his parents rest. And plans can change.

But in short, my mom when I was just a baby hired a domestic helper, we will just called her Samantha to help her take care of the household and me specifically. She of course had to handle my older brother who was 5 at the time. 

But ever since I turned 6 or 7, my father got laid off from his job and he just went MIA from our lives. So this forced my mom to get busy in finding a job even though she has been a homemaker all her life and that meant I didn’t get to see her a lot. Even back in my toddler years she wasn’t really present but ever since that point when my father left, she’s been just so busy. So in the end, Samantha ended up being my de facto mom but I didn’t really complain. She is a great lady and she took great care of me. 

At the time, She developed a great friendship with my mom after they spent enough time with each other but I could tell not everything is perfect and dandy. Eventually Samantha had to leave as my mom couldn’t afford to pay her anymore and I knew she wanted to stay despite everything as she told me before that she counted me as her second family outside her biological one but she had a duty to provide for her biological siblings education.

All went well, we had fun walking down memory lane as we went back to the old house for nostalgia purposes and we had a heart to heart talk before we went home after dinner.

But I think Samantha assumed that I have already told my mom beforehand and so spilled the beans without thinking much. Oh was my mom mad and yelled at me when I came back home for telling her that I was going out with a friend and not Samantha.

I just remained silent before telling my mom that she’s just jealous, that she’ll never understand me because after all she has mocked me for having Trypanophobia before via insulting my masculinity and other invalidating my feelings stuff so she can’t act all pissy.

I also told her that Samantha acted more like a mom than she could ever be and that made my mom storm back into her room and locked the door.

So I 15F had a friend who I'll call Ellie also 15F. We got close around the beginning of this year, part of the same friend group and all that. She came over to my house a lot, which I don't have often. And she was my closest friend for a very long while. Enough said I guess.

Last year I was in a relationship with a guy a year older than me. It quickly turned unconsensual. I won't go into detail, but a month after we broke up I had a highly unexpected miscarriage that I still haven't processed, or even understand really. That also sent me into a spiral.  For now I'm better in that regard, I'm now in therapy, and those thoughts have lessened, but not all the way. I still feel awful about what happened, and I haven't even told my therapist about the loss of my potential child. And because of what happened with my friend I won't be telling anyone else close to me.

So for what happened with Ellie. One night we were talking about our personal experiences, some traumatic stuff that happened to each other. It was pretty much the most serious conversation we ever had. And I told her about the miscarriage, and not all the details. I thought she understood a little, but obviously not as we're now here.

She started to tell me a couple days later that she 'didnt understand why women who have miscarriages, get so upset? You can always have another one'. I tried to ignore it at first but that really did hurt me. And made my thoughts spiral again. From that point any time she saw a miscarriage in any kind of media she'd immediately point it out to me and laugh about it. 

My breaking point with her was actually really random. She told one of my ex-friends (too long and not relevant) to end their lives as a joke. And I saw it as a way to get back at her. I egged her on in calls, and screen recorded her saying that she meant it. And then sent it to that other, now my friend again.

Also so the sub doesn't take me down. I may be TA because of what I did in retaliation. I shouldn't have screen recorded, and I shouldn't talk about Ellie behind her back. 

The day after that I hung out with the friend that everyone thought I still hated. And Ella tried to talk to me, still making some jokes (they're not funny), like the usual following me around and saying 'ill hurt you in your sleep'. Or something similar. (Hurt means something else but can't add it).  After that I didn't talk to her. She sent me one apology that wasn't even for what she did wrong. And that's where I think I messed up. I didn't tell her why I was upset. But I just thought she should've known as she has at least the common sense to know that what she said was absolutely awful.

109,1fb2n58,AITA when I wrote the blog post My husband's ex-girlfriend after 20 years ,"
AITA, because I wrote on my blog about my husband's ex-girlfriend.
Hi everyone,

So, I have been married to my current husband for 6years and we have been together for  8years. We have 5  children.
We moved from the other side of our country to my husband's former hometown.
One evening, a friend of mine called and told me that my husband had asked his ex-girlfriend for se*, who still lived in my husband's home area.
I had never heard this ex-girlfriend's name before because my husband dated her when he was 15 years old. It's been more than 20 years since their relationship.
This woman abused my husband badly during their relationship.husband's mother found out about this girl's behavior, she demanded that my husband stay away from this girl. In the end, their relationship ended because of the girl's violence.
My husband was away from his home area for more than 20 years. But, we came back here to live together because of the children. 
 my friend's sister is this ex-girlfriend's friend. I met this friend only recently, through our children.
I dont know how This woman knew me and my current last name. My husband took my last name when we got married. 
we are not active here in the city.
Somehow she recognized us. I didn't even know this ex-girlfriend by name, I did know her actions before.
I have never spoken/met these people.
Of course I asked my husband about it. my friend found out that this woman was lying. This ex-girlfriend changed her story and claimed that others had misunderstood it. I do have screenshots of what she said though.
I blog about my life. I don't have a lot of readers, but it's where I deal with things.

AITA, because I wrote on my blog about my husband's ex-girlfriend.
Hi everyone,

So, I have been married to my current husband for 6years and we have been together for  8years. We have 5  children.
We moved from the other side of our country to my husband's former hometown.
One evening, a friend of mine called and told me that my husband had asked his ex-girlfriend for se*, who still lived in my husband's home area.
I had never heard this ex-girlfriend's name before because my husband dated her when he was 15 years old. It's been more than 20 years since their relationship.
This woman abused my husband badly during their relationship.husband's mother found out about this girl's behavior, she demanded that my husband stay away from this girl. In the end, their relationship ended because of the girl's violence.
My husband was away from his home area for more than 20 years. But, we came back here to live together because of the children. 
 my friend's sister is this ex-girlfriend's friend. I met this friend only recently, through our children.
I dont know how This woman knew me and my current last name. My husband took my last name when we got married. 
we are not active here in the city.
Somehow she recognized us. I didn't even know this ex-girlfriend by name, I did know her actions before.
I have never spoken/met these people.
Of course I asked my husband about it. my friend found out that this woman was lying. This ex-girlfriend changed her story and claimed that others had misunderstood it. I do have screenshots of what she said though.
I blog about my life. I don't have a lot of readers, but it's where I deal with things.
So I wrote two articles on my blog, one about what happened and the other about violence against men and how others react to it.
I didn't tell names and my blog is one that is not under my name and is not identifiable. none of my readers even know where I live, so I act anonymously.

112,1fb2av3,AITA for asking boyfriend not to vape in bed when I don’t like the smell ,"My boyfriend and I have been together for 8 years. He has vaped through our entire relationship and I haven't liked it but because we lived apart it didn't bother me as much as it does since began living together permanently. I find that the house has a lingering stale but sweet smell when he has been vaping in the rooms. It's starting to bother me but I bottle it up. 

However, I have always asked that he doesn't vape in the bedroom. He said he would 'hold it in' but I tend to find myself waking up in the night to the smell of vape because he wakes up even in the night to vape. He literally holds his e-cig in his hand through his sleep. It is really bothering me now, I'm really sick of constantly having to smell the vape when I'm a non-smoker myself.

Yesterday I mentioned it to him again and he went to sleep in another room. He said he will stop vaping in the bedroom/house if I lose weight. I must admit I have put on weight (gone from a U.K. 8 to a U.K. 12) and it is not a bad thing for me to try to lose it but it seemed very unfair of him to put it back on me and make me change my body (which other than aesthetically, has no impact on him) before he stops doing something that actually impacts the air I breathe.

During that date, he mentioned that the mother of his children (9 and 6) still lived with him due to financial and citizenship reasons. I told him I admired his support, but it wasn’t what I was looking for, so we parted ways. However, he kept inviting me out, and eventually, I agreed to go on a trip with him. It was wonderful, and I saw how kind, intelligent, and sweet he was. Despite his complicated living situation, we decided to give the relationship a shot.

As we got closer, we realized we needed our own space since I had recently moved to this country and was living with my aunt. We spent great time together, had many dates, and talked constantly.

114,1fb22t5,AITA For Avoiding a religious event,"I was invited to my nephew's first Eucharist, they're 8. I've decided not to go as I despise religion and view it as harmful. I'm okay with going to weddings and funerals as celebrating a union or a life is meaningful and they concern adults but this is just a celebration of a religious milestone.

I think communion is worse than baptism (which I have attended) as a baby can't understand what's going on or the language spoken and are harmed less. Whereas in my view a catholic Eucharist involves dressing up kids like brides and telling them they're consuming the literal body and blood of christ in what amounts to a modern blood ritual. Confession also happens prior and telling kids they're sinful beings and need to confess disgusts me.

I have strong opinions and people in my life are aware that I'm atheist. I was indoctrinated into the church as a kid and rejected it as an adult, I view its impact as harmful, I was scared as a child of demons, scared of my ""sin"", bigoted to others, afraid of hell and filled with guilt. 

My dad had some mental issues which are now under control but at the time he would become manic and assert gods will and publicly preach to others etc. Me and religion don't get along. 

I was invited with my partner who is related to my nephew, my response was simply that I'm not going. 

Now some issues have arisen, as i wear my views on my sleeve. My nephew likes me and cried after finding out I won't be there and I've not assuaged them why. I don't want to provide support for their indoctrination and I don't want my name on any gifts my partner gives them and I don't want to pretend I have plans and thats the reason.

I've asked my her not to lie on my behalf either but she's indicated she probably will tell her family I had a good reason for not attending and give said gift in my name and congratulate my nephew on my behalf as she doesn't want to deal with her family.

I'm not happy with this as im not going because I don't want to, and if my name is on a card, it will come across like I'm supporting it all. It's caused friction as my partner doesn't want to hurt feelings, wants my nephew to know I don't hate them and doesn't want to tell their mother (her sis) that the only reason I'm not going is because I don't want to, that I am in fact free that day.

I'd rather just tell the them that I disagree with her religion, tell my nephew that they're great but I don't want to go and not speak positively of the event or congratulate them in any way. 

The event is in a week and I've made it clear to my partner that I'm not going to lie about this, I don't wanna be controlling so she can tell her family whatever she wants but if I'm asked directly ill simply say I didn't want to come.

118,1fb18ba,"AITA for accusing my bf of cheating, and blowing up his phone for answers?","tl;dr 
bf gave me his telegram as reassurance and then he created secret chats that can only be seen on the platform they were created. this makes me think he’s hiding something and i blew up his phone. now im embarrassed.

My (F20) bf (M22) of almost 4 years has hidden his porn addiction and the extent of it for our whole relationship. He went to Asia and I was so freaked out because he uses telegram to relapse.
He reassured me and told me I could have his telegram accounts to show me he is loyal.

2 weeks later, he is still there, and I found out he deleted texts with a girl. His excuse was “it was innocent and you would’ve freaked out”. Then, I saw his cousin invited him to a festival and he told her “Are you bringing your pretty friends?” to which she said a name and he said “boooring”. She asked “Don’t you have a girlfriend?” and he replied “it’s okay to look”, in russian (so i wouldn’t understand) and then deleted the chat.

I also saw his friend told him he’s going to football with a girl and my bf said “why not 4?”. This all shook me because I couldn’t recognise him. Ofcourse he said these were all just jokes.

After we had the whole argument about it, he went out to see his friends. As soon as he got home, he enabled secret chats that his friend told him about. Does this mean he told his friends about our argument and they told him he could still hide things from me? 

Secret chats are not cross-platform and do not work on pc. Yet, he told me “huh i thought you were able to see them because i can see them on my pc”. I asked him to show me with who he has a secret chat and he sent me a screenshot with half of his chats visible (he scrolled up so the search bar took up a lot of space).

I told him this is manipulation. He gives me his telegram to prove his loyalty and then he makes secret chats I cannot see. I only found out because of a stupid mistake he made. 

He is not coming home until at least another 2 weeks. I’ve been calling and texting trying to get my point across every time something happens and he just calls me dramatic and disregards what i say. He is now saying I blow up his phone too much, which is true i guess but I just want answers. I want to know if i’m being crazy or if he’s really cheating but regardless i stopped texting him while waiting to hear what y’all think.

We've faced some tough times together, so I know she's as committed to me as I am to her. However, over the past few months, she has been asking me to prove my love for her. When I asked what she meant, she explained that it would mean a lot to her if I could buy her something expensive, like an iPhone.



She knows that I just started working as an assistant professor at a university, and my salary barely covers my expenses. Because of this, I've even been considering taking on extra work. For the past year, I've been saving money to visit her this Christmas, a plan she has known about from the beginning. But when I told her about my plan, she suggested I use the savings to buy her the gift instead and postpone seeing her until next year, saying, ""We're not going to break up as a couple anytimesoon so come next year, and this will make me happy.""



I felt offended by her suggestion because she didn't seem to recognize all the sacrifices I've been making just to save money to see her. I've stopped eating out, and I haven't bought a laptop, even though it's mandatory for my job at the university (I usually have to borrow one from a colleague). Waiting another year would mean enduring more lonely nights without being able to see her in person.



When I shared my feelings with her, she said that wanting to see her isn't romantic but selfish because I'm prioritizing my desire to see her over her wish for an expensive gift. This made me feel bad and like a failure because I can't afford to provide something she really wants. It's left me questioning whether I'm in the wrong here.

123,1fb02i9,WIBTA for not visiting a family gathering on my birthday due to trauma?,"My maternal relatives are planning to host a massive family gathering for my birthday. However, I (23M) don't want to partake in the family gathering, mainly due to trauma. My relatives told me that if I don't come to this family gathering, they will not only withhold the ""li xi"" from me (they claimed it will be a lot), they will even withhold any future financial support in case I were to start a tech startup, so I would have to work my SWC and SWE job, rely on my father's side's money, or use the amount of crypto/stocks I have amassed to stay afloat and start an AI startup. Even if the ""li xi"" money would maybe enlighten my day (short term), I would rather drive a few hours to NYC and eat at a Chinese restaurant than deal with the family and be traumatised again.

Unfortunately, there has been some scandalous events stemming from this family, including the fact not only do they only speak in THEIR LANGUAGE to me, one of them even coerced me into speaking THEIR LANGUAGE or face repercussions later. From what I have heard, most of my maternal relatives in the US and all under 75 could speak English and many work at corporate jobs. The biggest drawback was due to moving to Russia from my home country at 5 and later the US at 11, I suffered from language attrition. However, I am quadrilingual.

The problem is they do know I don't speak their language and I have told them many times to speak English to me. Despite that, they still continued speaking their language to me and whenever they speak to me, it is always in a condescending tone. Meanwhile, for my sister (23F), their tone is more affectionate towards her. A fun fact is despite my 25F cousin was born in the US and her English is far better than her broken ""Asian"" language, she still spoke the Asian language on the plane (coincidentally, I spotted her on the same plane as me returning from Europe in 2022).

Another facet was back in 2015, my 50M cousin drove my two sisters (34F, 23F) and I (23M) to NYC and I was in the front passenger seat. It turns out he not only spoke only in his language, based on the Translate By Speech, he even coerced me into speaking his language. It went on for a few hours until we arrived in Worcester and based on the translation, he threatened to kick me out of the car and leave me stranded in the highway if I didn't comply. My mother living in Asia (63F) then told me that he was ""joking"" at the time.

What's even more nefarious is the blatant favouritism towards my 23F sister and disparate treatments between both of us. Despite the fact I achieved more (qualified for USAMO, ISEF, programmed at 8, could memorise a Chopin Nocturne, and was class president and founder of my HS's CS club), I was essentially never congratulated for my accomplishments, whilst she was bestowed a new BMW + apartment from pooled money despite she is just your typical high achiever (1570 SAT, volunteering at hospitals, worked as mentor, 5's on multiple APs, and no spikes).",Not the A-hole,2024-09-07,"WIBTA for not visiting a family gathering on my birthday due to trauma?

124,1fb02a1,AITA for not sticking up for myself to my family for not getting therapy? ,"I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for over a year. In my life, I’ve suffered from serious anxiety and bdd. It’s caused me to hide my true feelings and emotions from people, because I’m always worried that if I talk, I’ll be chastised. When I try to open up about my anxiety or problems, my family tends to spin things to make it my fault. 

I did college for a while, and I just couldn’t do it. I didn’t understand anything and it was way harder than in high school. I went to a counselor at the school and she was the closest thing to help I’ve ever gotten. She talked school stuff, but also talked about my anxiety and how to overcome it. My dad was with us, and he just kept going on and on about how “grade school was so easy for me, there’s no reason college should be hard. He doesn’t understand how I can be so lazy about it” Thankfully, we decided my dad and I doing co counseling. My dad was hesitant and did not want to do counseling, so counselor said that I should do counseling on my own. 

Unfortunately, my dad doesn’t believe in mental help. I knew that the counseling would never happen, because I was to do mandatory therapy for a serious event that happened in my life. I won’t get into details, but I was a minor at the time and was told by multiple people of power that therapy I NEEDED to do. However, my dad denied me because “I learned my lesson, and we need to move on” Since the talk with the school counselor, he had stopped talking to me in general. 

When my boyfriend found out, he was enraged. He wants me to leave home and go live with him. His family, who he still lives with, are willing to take me in. However, I’m scared my family will disown me for my choice to leave. Despite their issues, I need them in my life. They are everything to me. It’s not easy to let them go. My boyfriend then said if the time came, I had to pick one of them. If I picked my family, he is gone. I love him so much, I can’t let him go. But if I stay with my family, I will probably not be mentally stable. He really wants to stand up for myself and just go off on my family and leave. Everytime I try, I just end up backing down and being subservient to my family.

I feel like an asshole despite what I choose to do. Whenever I try to talk to my dad about everything that’s happened, he just refuses to look me in the eyes. If I had a hard time talking to him before, I definitely have it even worse now. But I can’t lose the love of my life because he truly does help me. AITA?

When my boyfriend found out, he was enraged. He wants me to leave home and go live with him. His family, who he still lives with, are willing to take me in. However, I’m scared my family will disown me for my choice to leave. Despite their issues, I need them in my life. They are everything to me. It’s not easy to let them go. My boyfriend then said if the time came, I had to pick one of them. If I picked my family, he is gone. I love him so much, I can’t let him go. But if I stay with my family, I will probably not be mentally stable. He really wants to stand up for myself and just go off on my family and leave. Everytime I try, I just end up backing down and being subservient to my family.

I feel like an asshole despite what I choose to do. Whenever I try to talk to my dad about everything that’s happened, he just refuses to look me in the eyes. If I had a hard time talking to him before, I definitely have it even worse now. But I can’t lose the love of my life because he truly does help me. AITA? ",4.0,0.016272418,0,0
125,1fazyit,WIBTAH if I told a new girl about my EXTREMELY toxic ex bestfriend ,"so, 3 weeks ago I went to church with my grandma. I have 3 friends that go there so I went up to youth with them. The youth pastor had us go around saying our names and schools, and one of the girls said the name of my old school that I JUST left. So of course I talked to her about it and she was really nice/sweet. Well then last week in the background of my friends BeReal I saw the face that had haunted me for months, despite not seeing it in person sense may. This girl bullied me despite claiming to be my bestfriend for about 4 months. she also talked bad about others including MY FRIENDS to me. It’s weird that she treated me so badly cause I was literally her only friend besides like 2 7th graders… she was just a really snobby and judge mental person. anyways, WIBTAH if the next time I went to church I started a convo with her going soemthing like “how’s (school name) so far?” 
“Good!” 
“Do you know a (ex bestfriends name)?”
“Yea, I live her sm!” 
“oh, goodluck with that” 


Is that mean?? I want to be able to somehow caution or warn her without straight up being 
“FONT HANGOUT WITH HER!” Is there another way I could do it. I know they’ve been hanging out a bit cause I’m friends with basically everyone that goes there and they’ve all told that’s who that new girl hangs out with … I feel bad for her.

126,1fazv8a,AITA for trying to convince my sister to leave her toxic baby daddy for good?,"AITA for trying to convince my sister to leave her toxic baby daddy for good?

I (29F) am really struggling with how to help my sister (39F), and I’m starting to wonder if I’m the asshole for constantly pushing her to cut ties with her baby daddy (42M) ??

Here’s some context:

My sister has been raising my niece (almost 4) completely on her own since the day she was born. Her baby daddy has never been involved in any meaningful way—no child support, no diapers, clothes, or any help for that matter. He’s the kind of guy who is out partying every weekend but claims he doesn’t have money to provide for his daughter. He constantly jumps from job to job and is never stable. Despite this, my sister keeps holding out hope that he’ll change.

It’s so frustrating because we (my parents, husband, and I) have seen how toxic and manipulative he is. He never shows up for his daughter and whenever he interacts with my sister, it’s always a fight. He’s said horrible things to her—accusing her of being a bad mom, calling her names, and bringing up a painful abortion she had years ago because of a toxic ex. He’s also made threats to take full custody of my niece, even though he doesn’t actually want to be a father.

The most recent situation really set me off. My sister finally went out for the first time in THREE years (and I was with her). One of her baby daddy’s friends saw her out and started spreading lies, saying she was all over some guy (which never happened). Her baby daddy flipped out, sent her texts all night calling her a slut, a bad mom, and a “baby killer” because of her past. It got so bad my dad had to step in and confront him and his family.

We thought things might settle down after that, but no. A few days later, my sister let him see my niece at a public park. Apparently, he’s now threatening to off himself if she moves on and dates someone else.

We’ve tried everything to get her to see that he’ll never change and will never be the father my niece deserves. My whole family is against her being with him in any capacity, but she still holds out hope that he’ll fix things. I’ve been really vocal about this and have tried to convince her to cut him off for good, but it doesn’t seem to be getting through.

So, AITA for pushing my sister to leave this toxic guy once and for all, or should I back off and let her figure it out on her own?

This happened a couple of yrs ago (2022) but has recently resurfaced. Me (18 F) and my brother (13 M) had a joint High school and Middle school grad party. I was going to be going off to college in Iowa so not too far from home, however far enough to not be around anymore. So my mom invites S to come. S was like a sister to my mom, my mom was an only child so I called S my aunt. S comes and she brought me and my brother both gifts. We of course said thank you and put it on the gift table. we were going to open the gifts at home. S comes up to us and asks us if we could open her gift. We politely told her we were going to wait until we got home, we didn’t want attention on the gifts. She understood and said she wanted to see us open the gifts. This normally isn’t a problem cause she lives down the street from our house. Well when we got home we tried calling S multiple times and no response. I was leaving the next day for summer camp at college and wanted to open my gifts. I ask my mom what we should do and she said to send S a video of us opening our gifts, So we did. She handmade us blankets with our names on it. They were sewn and decently sized. As a crafter myself, I am able to understand and appreciate the time and effort these took. The next day I leave for summer camp and haven’t heard from S. I come home a week later and my mom told me S came marching into our house and screamed at my brother for not waiting to open her gift. She called us both ungrateful and my dad had to force her out of our house. My mom was very upset and my brother was hurt by her actions. My mom tried going over there and talking to her but she told my mom we were ungrateful aholes who didn’t deserve handmade gifts. My mom explained that we tried getting ahold of her but she didn’t respond. S then yelled at my mom and told her how awful of a mother she was. I was shocked and mad at S for the way she treated my family. I told my mom she didn’t deserve that and none of this is her fault. S has a daughter who is a few years younger than me that I’ve always considered to be my cousin. Me and my cousin still stayed in contact when I was in college, but I didn’t talk to S at all. S tried reaching out to apologize once and I told her I do not accept her apology. She doesn’t have the right to treat my mom and brother like that over not being able to watch us open our gifts in person. A year later, I asked my cousin to have lunch with me while I was home from school. She then told me that her mom said she’s no longer allowed to talk to me and that she would be grounded if she did. I had my last straw and reached out to my aunt. I told her that her behavior is unacceptable and she cannot tell my cousin that she can’t talk to me over this stupid situation. My aunt then blocked me on everything and told me to never call her again. Recently I ran into my aunt in town and she flipped me off.

He didn't want to see me, as we are both busy with work (He's an assistant manager and I help run a bakery with a friend/work at a fast food place) he told me that his mom and him were out with friends and his relationship was brought up. 
He started saying that he has a gf and that he loves me and couldn't live without me. His mom said that although she's met me countless times, she still prefers any of his other exes than me. They are much better looking and have more taste. He told me all this and i felt like shit. I told him that he should have kept it to himself and not said anything. My feelings were hurt and he told me that she was drunk and out of her mind. I told him it didn't matter, drunk people and little kids tell the truth.

129,1fay96v,AITA for telling my wife that she has to take care of the baby all night (if needed) on our upcoming trip? ,"My (M36) wife (F36) is a physician who works in the ER and has a very stress-full job. I work from home for an IT company. We have two kids: A 3yr old boy and a 11 month old baby girl. Because of her work hours and stressful job I’m taking the workload of taking care of the kids. The boy goes to daycare while I watch the baby all day. Breakfast lunch and dinner for the baby and breakfast and dinner for the boy. I also bathe them both and do bedtime with the boy.

Recently my wife got an opportunity to go to California for a medical conference and I told her that she can go alone if she wants and it can be a nice break for her.. but she insists on us all going. She said she doesn’t need to go but it will be a fun trip and she can use that time for a trip as it won’t be part of her PTO. 

Now I would rather her be home to help me with the kids but she was so excited to visit as she’s never been there. I insisted on her going alone. It will be less stressful for her. She can explore after conference hours. It will suck for me but at least we’ll be in a controlled area which is our house. There’s space, all their toys, kitchen, my desk with a monitor setup etc. as opposed to the ‘vacation’ where we’ll be cramped in a Hilton hotel room. The kids have never slept in the same room ever. And not only do we have to worry about taking strollers and car seats with us on the flight (which I’ll be doing since it will be too heavy for my wife) we have to carry two kids. We have to make sure there are two cribs at the hotel room, a functioning freezer for my wife’s breastmilk, activities for my toddler boy since wtf is he going to do in a hotel room all day while his mom is at a conference and his dad is taking care of a baby while making zoom calls to work. 

I’ve begged my wife to reconsider this but she said she’ll take some conference days off or she’ll leave early if things are overwhelming for me since it will be down the street from the hotel that we’ll be staying at. And I dunno I’m so exhausted lately I just gave in and agreed to the trip. But now I’m rocking the baby at midnight and I’m just fuming that I’m not only watching the baby and the boy during the weekend (she has weekend call at work that she signed up for because it’s extra money) I’m also rocking the baby back to sleep. I angrily texted my wife that when we go on the trip.. you have to stay up all night to rock the baby or contact sleep the baby in her arms while you stay up all night. She felt really bad and said that she’ll swap with me.. but she has work tomorrow and I don’t so I said it’s fine. But I can tell I made her feel like shit and I feel bad about that.. but at the same time I don’t know if I’m actually being an asshole. Am I actually being one?

Holy shit this was a really long post. I’m very sorry about that! 

Edit: Oh man I’m getting a lot of responses! I will have a chat with my wife. I really don’t want to go on this cross country flight. 

Also I’m getting a lot of worried responses about calling my son “the boy”. I’ve been his primary parent and watched every minute of every day since he was born till 1.5 yrs as I work from home and took care of him. I call him “the boy” as a descriptor for this post and also I was typing this up at like midnight while holding my daughter in the rocking chair. 

Edit: I’m also getting a lot of responses about childcare. We’ve been looking for a nanny and where we are (east coast) nannys have a pay rate of $30/hr. Which is not unreasonable as they do a lot. But it’s not in our budget right now. Yes we’re both high income earners but my wife also JUST became a doctor so her high salary started a year ago. Plus we bought a house in this economy with high interest rates and our mortgage is burning a hole through our account alongside daycare costs, student loans repayments etc. So I’d rather take the hit and keep her home as opposed to paying $57k a year for a nanny. I guess we could put her in daycare but she’s too little for that imo. My job has great flexibility in that there’s a lot of downtime and I can do my work at nights when they sleep so I figured at home care is good for now.

Recently, I saw that Marie had a newer, separate/alt account that wanted to match with me on Facebook Dating, like it was Marie's name, pfp, even typing style in the bio and answers to questions. I messaged Kayla and I was like ""uh. ok so...idk if this is a weird question, but it's actually three questions: 1) did Marie make an alt, 2) does your sister like me as more than friends, and 3) would it be weird for you if i matched with her on a dating site if this is all legit???""

To which Kayla responded ""Oh lol that was actually me. I use Marie's pics because I hate pictures of myself lmao"" and ofc I'm like ""Kayla, 1) since when do *YOU* like me like that, 2) why didn't you just tell me bc i confessed to you like 3 years ago and you stopped talking to me for a week, and 3) does Marie know that you're using her pictures and name on dating sites? like, that could be really dangerous if a date goes badly and the person decides to look up her name to get her address. also, it's kind of creepy in general?""

Kayla told me that, no, Marie doesn't know, and she's implied that our friendship will be heavily impacted if I tell. She also insists it's not creepy bc ""technically it's her face, too."" Which...idk if that's a *valid* point, but it is, like, a point. 

Despite the fact that Kayla and I have been friends for years (and...honestly the fact that if Kayla had matched with me straight up, I would've matched back in a heartbeat...), I just feel like this is really weird, and like Marie needs to know what's up here.

I have screenshots of the dating profile that I took to show Kayla just in case it was fake, and I grabbed screenshots of all the messages in case Kayla unsends everything.

Despite being of the same age, she told me she considered me an older sister figure rather than just a friend (I'm a couple months older than her), and often come to me for advice, or just to rant about life.

Recently, we met up for a coffee, and she told me about this guy at work who she believed had feelings for her. My friend didn't have a good childhood, and she always dreams of having a happy family. She wishes to find the love of her life, marrying him, and just have her happily ever after, so when she told me about this guy, I congratulated her at first. Then I asked how she knew the guy had feelings for her, and she showed me her proofs, but all of them just looked to me like she was making a big deal out of it, while in reality, they were not romantic gestures like she seemed to think:

- First, she told me how the guy helped her pick up her things after he bumped into her in the hallway and she dropped all her papers and folders on the ground. All I saw from this was a nice guy helping a co-worker instead of ignoring her.

- Then, she told me that one time he asked if she had eaten anything. The context of this incident was that: they both had to work OT, and according to her, after he asked and she said she would eat later, he went back to his work, so again, I just saw this as her co-worker being nice.

- According to her, this guy does digital art in his free time, so she showed me one of the drawing he made that she said was about her. Mind you, we are Asians, we live in an Asian country, so the majority of women here have dark hair and dark eyes, which were the two characteristics the girl in the drawing had. My friend asked me if I could see the resemblances between the drawing and her, and to be honest? I saw none. Imagine those generic AI drawings of dark hair and dark eyes women. His drawing was kind of like that, so all I saw was something probably AI-generated. No resemblances whatsoever to my friend.

- She also showed me a tweet that he wrote. It was just a generic emotional speech, ending with a flower emoji at the end. Apparently, the tweet was made on the same day she wore a flower hairclip to work, so according to my friend, the tweet was meant for her.

She was all happy and gleeful about these proofs, and she asked me what I think. I told her the guy probably just saw her as another co-worker, that every ""sign"" she noticed so far was just her trying to convince herself they had deeper meanings. My friend got mad at me, telling me I was too inexperienced about romantic matter (I'm aromantic) to see what she saw, that I was insensitive and jealous.

133,1faxctd,AITA for calling out my friend,"My friend (11M) and his family are staying over at my (15M) house.

His dad makes him do exercises every morning. His dad is not really fit, but wants his sons to be. According to him and his mom this consists of 150 pushups in 5 minutes, a mile run, and 200 jumps with a jump rope every morning.

I recently started going to the gym, so I've been watching a lot of fitness videos and such. I know that doing less reps with proper form is better than more with bad form. Ever since he and his family started saying that he was doing all these exercises, kind of bragging, I wanted to see if he was actually doing his pushups with proper form. I didn't actually say anything though.

Basically for the past few days we have been sitting around playing video games and board games. We don't meet them much so it was fun. His dad said we should probably do some exercise. I agreed and so did everyone else. (I also have an 11M brother and he has a 7M brother)

So we started by doing pushups. For context, I am a pretty strong kid (I think) and can do around 30 clean pushups. 150 in 5 minutes is definitely out of the question for me though. My friend is quite skinny so I wanted to see how he did them. As expected, his butt was up, he only went about halfway down, and his arms were shaky.

This is the part where I might be an asshole. I admit that actually seeing him do it kind of made me kind of cringe. It was clear he could not do even 10 clean pushups. I kind of called him out and said ""No, those are definitely not pushups."" or something similar (I don't remember exactly). I then proceeded to demonstrate what a proper pushup looks like. Both of our families were there including parents (but not his dad).

While he took it graciously and agreed that his form could definitely need some work, his mom was silent. I think my dad could see that she was a little uncomfortable and tried to play it off. He basically said that it's good he's doing something at least, which I do agree with. Then my friend started another set, and his form was still off, so I went to correct him again. This time, my dad was mad and told me I should not have interfered, and that I should mind my own business.

I know that his mom was probably a little uncomfortable, but I think it was still better for him to do actual pushups. I admit that I felt a desire to debunk his claim, but it was still for his bettering. AITA?

Recently my mom had been yelling at me over her being tired and nobody helping her around the house. Which I must say is not true because both my dad and I help alot between cooking and cleaning. But anyways, eventually she said a few hurtful things and I told her that she would never speak to my brother like that, and how he gets favored. Which she did not take a liking to, but let me explain.

And yes, I know in the hindsight it is smaller things. But the constant trend I see had me questioning it. We both work full time jobs, I help pay some bills around the house and even with groceries (especially since everything has gotten so expensive). Meanwhile, he pays for nothing but his own bills. I have came home to no food for dinner because my brother had ate whatever my mom didn't finish from dinner. Whenever I would mention anything about it, my parents kinda just chuckle it off. Here's the kicker, a week later my mom had made some chinese food, and my brother was going out for the weekend so he wasn't going to eat at home. So whatever my mom didn't eat, I finished. His plan ended up slightly changing and he came home the next day looking for leftovers. When he mentioned to my mom that there was nothing, she FLIPPED out at me. Asking how I can do such a thing, and why i'm not being considerate. This is a small thing. 

Lights being left on overnight, Door not being locked, music too loud at night, dishes being left in the sink, leaves whatever he uses a mess. All this my brother does (on a constant basis), but they never say anything to him.

They yell at me about it as if getting it off their chest and then are in great spirits when he comes home.

I don't even want to say this because its just the bare minimum to do at home but I help with chores around the house.  Sweeping, Mopping, Vaccuming. I couldn't tell you the last time my brother picked up any of those things. My parents still have to clean his bedroom and bathroom. 

I really try to not put stress on my parents as they are getting older which is why I help pay for bills, help around the house and just be as supporting as I can.

Now I don't want to sound hateful because at the end of the day, I love my brother. But man do I feel like he gets favored. Maybe it's just a younger sibling thing?

136,1favpvw,AITA for writing a birthday post for my roommate even though my mother would be able to see it?,"As some may know from a previous post, my familial life has been rather hectic this past year. My (24f) mother (49f) got into a dispute with one of my bio sisters (23f) and my roommate, her best friend of 12 years (24f, who I'll call RM); this resulted in everyone moving out. My roommate currently lives with my grandfather (80m) and my other sister (23f). This past week she and my twin sisters celebrated their 23rd and 24th birthdays as their birthdays are just three days apart. I'll admit that while I'm glad I don't have to see my mother every day anymore, it's been a bit of a rough adjustment not being around my sisters all the time. I now live with one of my mother's best friends, who I consider an aunt (38f), her husband (68m), and her two kids (15f & 2m). Me, RM and my other sister want to rent a house together in the very near future, an idea my mother thinks she has any room to object to.

As their birthdays just passed, I decided to make a post on my Facebook page for my RM. It's a tradition the four of us do every year for each other and the two littlest ones. Just because my mother has decided she has issues with them does not make me obligated to break this small but meaningful tradition. In the post I called her my Irish twin because she's less than a year younger than me and I consider her a sister to me since she's been here for over a decade. My mother saw the post a few hours after I wrote it and texted my aunt, not me, my aunt. She told my aunt to ""please tell me that RM is not my sister"". She did not respond to the message and still hasn't several days later. I don't know why she went to my aunt instead of me and tried to make her play messenger, but it might be because she knows I won't let her have her way.

I don't really want my mother to try and cause issues with me too, but I'm very combative and I don't plan on taking the post down because we have relatives on my page who have very little idea what's going on between my mother and my siblings. I know they'll ask questions if they see the post suddenly disappear. At first, I thought she wouldn't notice it as she has many friends who post on an almost daily basis, herself included, so I assumed it would get lost in the shuffle on her timeline. I'm half-tempted to just block her on Facebook, or at least hide my future posts from her so that she can't throw any fits that may come if I post Halloween, Thanksgiving or Christmas goings-on with the girls in it. I love my sisters and I will do whatever I have to to not only protect myself but them as well. She threatened to cut off anyone who still has contact with the three of them, but her dad (our grandpa) was quick to shut that down and threatened to cut off her financial support and else because he's helped her with bills and taxes occasionally in the past.

So We hadn’t spoken for about 4 years before I got engaged then all the sudden she would start messaging me randomly which I didn’t really mind it was nothing but checking in and would drop subtle hints about getting an invite which I would just brush off and say it’s a really small wedding which it was. She then started telling my family when she would see them around town she had better get an invite and if not she would crash my wedding. 
This lasted up until the day I got married harassing my family but never me about getting an invite. We had a small wedding since weddings are ridiculously expensive and just had close friends and family there. 
She saw my cousin one day and told her how hurt she was she didn’t get invited. 
I just don’t understand why she’s so upset, she hadn’t talked to me in years and she didn’t invite me to her baby shower because we are not close at all anymore.

So We hadn’t spoken for about 4 years before I got engaged then all the sudden she would start messaging me randomly which I didn’t really mind it was nothing but checking in and would drop subtle hints about getting an invite which I would just brush off and say it’s a really small wedding which it was. She then started telling my family when she would see them around town she had better get an invite and if not she would crash my wedding. 
This lasted up until the day I got married harassing my family but never me about getting an invite. We had a small wedding since weddings are ridiculously expensive and just had close friends and family there. 
She saw my cousin one day and told her how hurt she was she didn’t get invited. 
I just don’t understand why she’s so upset, she hadn’t talked to me in years and she didn’t invite me to her baby shower because we are not close at all anymore. 
Am I the asshole for not inviting her? I honestly don’t know everyone is telling me that I’m not but I’m not sure. ",0.0,0.0064985612,0,1
138,1favj5v,AITA for turning on the sprinklers to get my neighbors away from my lawn?,"Basically what the title says, we live in a court with a large front lawn that's held back by a retaining wall. The retaining wall fronts the sidewalk, so its about 40-feet away from our front door and about 5-feet from the street/court. Today our neighbors and some of their friends/workers (about 3 dudes) were sitting on front end of our retaining wall, something they've done a handful of times recently. That area is shaded around the noon time so I assume that's why. I don't usually water my lawn in the afternoon, but I turned the sprinklers on, got them a little wet, they quickly got up, looked confused and left. Now my partner is mad at me because she doesn't feel its a big deal and it wasn't the 'nice' thing to do. She thinks I should have asked them nicely to move first if I felt they've been hanging around there too often. However, at this point I don't feel like asking nicely because they've always been inconsiderate.

Here are some examples:

* Parking several cars in the court and causing us to drive around them to get to our driveway. We asked them to stop and they did mostly stop blocking our driveway. However, they still have events every week where all their friends/family park their cars in our court. So we still have to drive around them to access our driveway.
* They were using a small portion of our drive way to drive into their backyard and it was leaving tire tracks on the corners. I didn't like that so I put cinder blocks there. They started to move the cinder blocks out of the way to use our drive way. I let them know it was okay so long as they put the cinder blocks back. They would always forget to put the blocks back even though i'd remind them constantly. Eventually I replaced them with heavy planters, now they cant use our driveway at all.
* They've been working on a shed adjacent to our shared fence. Either them or their workers threw some trash over the fence. Not sure but we never brought it up to them.
* Sometimes they shift/move our garbage cans and dont fix them.

According to my partner and other roommate, I've voiced things to them very ""rudely"" in the past, so now my partner or our other roommate voices my issues to them. For context neither my partner or our other roommate have felt that these issues were a big deal. My partner is unconfrontational and believes in keeping the peace so she feels that I was very rude. My issue is I don't feel the need to be considerate when they clearly haven't been considerate to us. I don't feel the need to deal with them in a civil manner anymore.

My (27f) dad (66m) is a very passionate sports fan. He’s so passionate that he criticizes and hates on teams he’s supposed to be a fan of.

Maybe go for a run instead or workout at home to be more available for our daughter. Help in the chores on the weekends and make a meal or 2.

141,1faurz1,AITA for asking my dad to move out?,"Background: my sister and I (21f, 23m) ended up getting a paid off house from our grandfather. The situation is that my parents got divorced, and my mom died when I was 15. Her father had left her the house so it was transferred to us through her will.  We are both in college and I'm graduating this semester. Our dad's been living with us since we got the house (1year) and he's been paying all of the bills but luckily didnt have any rent or mortgage to pay. We have paid everything for our educations. 

The argument: 
My sister and I came to the decision that we would like to not live with our parent anymore after college. I told him that he can take 6-8 months to find a new place.  If he needs longer he can of course take longer. I just wanted to get the ball rolling


My thought is that I'm 23 years old, and have 2 good paying (70k) job options lined up for after graduation. I just feel like it's time for us to go out on our own. Also, we are on different sleep schedules. He gets mad when we are loud at night and we get mad when he's loud in the morning. Furthermore, we want to sell this house soon and move to a smaller house in the woods. I know that he's paid the bills and I'm grateful for that but we did contribute by helping him avoid rent payments and paying all of our college bills. I'm upset that he's not happy for kids for wanting to be independent. To be honest, I'm upset too because he went to live with his girlfriend's family when we were kids. Leaving us with our drunk mom after the divorce. I'm done feeling like I need to look out for my parents when I really don't feel like they have looked out for me when I was a kid. So yeah the decision is emotional. 


His side:
He will eventually get half of his mother's house. He wanted us to let him live with us to save up and buy his brother out on the house.  He got screwed in the divorce, lost a lot of his retirement and doesn't make a ton of money (50k). Since I asked him to move out he won't talk to us at all. He also said he already found a place to rent and wants to move out immediately.

This isn't really a problem because my sister and I have 90k leftover from our moms retirement. We can just use that to pay the taxes, utility and food until my job starts. After that I'm willing to pay the bills until my sister gets a job.  I expect this runs about $2100 a month.

I know that it would have been nice to let him live with us but I'm not trying to wait to execute my life plans. 

Tldr: I inherited his (ex)-wifes house (my moms), i asked him to leave because I can now afford the bills without him.

My youngest brother, Jimmy, (19) has Downs Syndrome and autism. Jimmy is not one of the high-functioning ""success"" stories you see on social media. He has limited language, was never toilet trained, and is essentially a 1 year old in the body of a grown man.

As I am 10 years old than him, and the eldest daughter let's be honest, a significant amount of my teenage years were spent carrying for him--or for my younger siblings while my parents were busy with Jimmy. He was, without a doubt the center of their attention and our family the moment he was born. While I understand in part why this was necessary, it still hurts that no one else was allowed a special moment after he was born.

When my older brother, Timmy, (and only older sibling) got married last year, he and his husband opted to elope to avoid the drama of ""What to do with Jimmy?"" Timmy knew that my parents would want Jimmy to be his best man etc (they have said as much) and so he just skipped the whole thing. My  sisters and I had been invited to Cancun for the elopement/wedding, but we have not told our parents we were there.

I am having a biggish wedding, because it matters to my fiance's family. He really wants my parents to attend so we invited them. They immediately started discussing what Jimmy's needs would be. I told them that the invitation was for them, not Jimmy. They would have to use respite care for Jimmy (they do use respite for him on a fairly regular basis. This isn't new). They are now refusing to come  unless Jimmy can come. And I am hurt all over again.

I don't want Jimmy at my wedding. He is disruptive and I want one day that isn't focused on his needs. I know this is selfish, but I am done. I didn't get a high school, college, or med school graduation, because of Jimmy. I just want a wedding.

(Back story. I was a para educator for 6 years before becoming a teacher. I worked at a title 1 school with a ton of behaviors. I also worked in the health room. I don’t cave in easily. )

I worked my first position at a different school, but same district. The situation was sad. This 3rd grade teacher was being forced to teach at a different school, 6 days AFTER school started. A lot of the students were attached to her and not taking it well. I was only there to sub for 2 days until the new teacher stepped in.

I was placed into a room with no supplies, no lesson plan, and the phone wasn’t even connected. I was trying to wrap my head around the situation before the students came in.

When they came in the morning, many were mad that I was subbing, mind you I’ve never met these students before. They kept talking about how unfair their teacher was being forced to leave. One student flat out told me she doesn’t have to listen to subs or tell me her name. 

They tried to walk the hallway to calm down, I said no. They wanted to go to their old classroom, I said no. They were talking and crying about their teacher and when I tried to help them, they got mad I was talking about their teacher. They did have a calming corner if needed and I allowed them to use the bathroom whenever they needed. 

Any work I tried to get them to do was met with anger and avoidance. Some students were goofing off and wouldn’t let me talk. I did yell at them a few times and told them they were being rude. I agreed the situation was awful, but that doesn’t mean they could treat me that way. 

The next day, parents called to complain I was rude. Several students stayed home because they didn’t want them being with the sub again. I was talked to by the principal and told next time to call the office and let them handle it if it was too much.

145,1faujlb,AITA for taking care of myself early postpartum instead of catering to my in-laws ,"I recently had my first baby. Not only was the pregnancy difficult, but postpartum has been trying as well. I've had issues healing from my c-section, in addition to mentally having a hard time. Family and friends are very sweet and have offered to come over and help, but I'm not the type of person who asks for help. I tend to self isolate and get through it on my own, probably from childhood trauma forcing me to be independent at a very young age. I don't like to burden other people if I don't have to. 

My husband and I were at a point where we were ready to invite immediate family and grandparents over to host. When we called my husband's grandparents, they were very short with us about the invitation and declined to come over. We were very confused about their tone, but figured they had something else bugging them. After a couple of days, the conversation still felt weird, so we called them again to check in with them. My grandmother-in-law was again, short with my husband. He asked her if something was wrong and she unleashed. She was hurt by not seeing us sooner. She thinks it's odd that we've ""been keeping her great granddaughter from family"" because back when she had kids, she was surrounded by family early postpartum. She said she doesn't even feel like a great grandmother and doesn't even believe that her great granddaughter exists.

We were both shocked and in disbelief by her comments. Communication is a two way street and we hadn't heard from her at all since she had met baby in the hospital. It feels hurtful that we have just been trying to stay afloat the first couple of weeks and are now being accused of keeping our daughter from her. I could understand her frustration IF we had been blowing her off, but that is not the case. I thought people were supposed to give grace to new parents.

Due to my isolating tendencies, I want to distance myself even more and not have to waste my energy on toxic family members, however I know that life is short and it wouldn't be fair to my daughter, or husband.

Am I an asshole for not reaching out to them sooner? An I the asshole for thinking her accusations are unfair?

I tend to self isolate and get through it on my own, probably from childhood trauma forcing me to be independent at a very young age. I don't like to burden other people if I don't have to. 

My husband and I were at a point where we were ready to invite immediate family and grandparents over to host. When we called my husband's grandparents, they were very short with us about the invitation and declined to come over. We were very confused about their tone, but figured they had something else bugging them. After a couple of days, the conversation still felt weird, so we called them again to check in with them. My grandmother-in-law was again, short with my husband. He asked her if something was wrong and she unleashed. She was hurt by not seeing us sooner. She thinks it's odd that we've ""been keeping her great granddaughter from family"" because back when she had kids, she was surrounded by family early postpartum. She said she doesn't even feel like a great grandmother and doesn't even believe that her great granddaughter exists.

We were both shocked and in disbelief by her comments. Communication is a two way street and we hadn't heard from her at all since she had met baby in the hospital. It feels hurtful that we have just been trying to stay afloat the first couple of weeks and are now being accused of keeping our daughter from her. I could understand her frustration IF we had been blowing her off, but that is not the case. I thought people were supposed to give grace to new parents.

Due to my isolating tendencies, I want to distance myself even more and not have to waste my energy on toxic family members, however I know that life is short and it wouldn't be fair to my daughter, or husband.

Am I an asshole for not reaching out to them sooner? An I the asshole for thinking her accusations are unfair? ",0.0,-0.002732,0,1
146,1fauiud,AITA for telling my roommate not to get another pet?,"A friend moved in with me recently (about 6 months ago). She needed a place, and I figured it was a great opportunity to lower monthly expenses so it all worked out nicely. I have one cat, and she brought one cat when she moved in.

Our cats didn't really get along at first. My cat wanted a playmate but her cat was disinterested and mostly hissed back. (We did slow introductions and everything - nothing bad happened but they are far from snuggly with one another). To this day they don't play or snuggle and mostly swat/hiss at one another.

A couple months into living here she asked if she could bring a kitten home. I thought it would be an interesting idea since my cat clearly wanted a playmate, but I was hesitant since we are only technically allowed 2 pets on our lease. I eventually agreed, and she brought a super cute kitten home. Another round of slow introductions later, it seemed like my cat and the new kitten would be great play buddies.

That's when things got complicated. Her kitten brought ringworm (a fungal infection) into the house and infected all of us (both cats and humans). After a whole bunch of quarantine and disinfection, my cat and I are still dealing with it. 

My other complaint is that she is constantly buying new things. (mostly for the cats - new toys, scratching things, etc). I 100% appreciate spoiling the kitties, but the apartment is starting to feel cramped & cluttered which really affects me. Since bringing the kitten home, she has mentioned that she will be getting either a ferret or lizard next. 🫣 I didn't say anything at the time hoping that she was talking about long term plans, but now it's come up a few more times since then. I have been low key panicking about the idea.

Recently we had to renew the lease. I basically told her that I don't want any more animals brought into the apartment for the next year. We're already over the pet limit, the apartment is cramped already, and I didn't want to deal with more pets. 

She explained that any other other animals would only be in her room, not free roaming around the house. Also lizards/caged animals don't count towards the pet limit on a lease. 

I am still hesitant though. After the whole ringworm fiasco, our adult cats not getting along, all the suprise stuff brought into the common area, and having to pet sit while she's away for weekends... I just don't want any more critters. It's a hard no for me.

147,1faui0e,WIBTA for not going to my moms wedding reception,"
Background: My sis and I got kicked out of my moms house at the age of14-15. bc her and my step dad moved in together, he had 3 kids of his own and there wasn’t enough rooms and “we had somewhere else to go, they didn’t”, so we moved in w our dad who wasn’t able to financially provide for us so we ended up moving in with my aunt.  
     We lived there for ab a year or so not talking to my mom at all. I ended up quitting school in9th grade and moving in w a  boy I was dating, I ended up living there for 1.5 years til I was made to go back to school. I moved in with my bff for my jr and sr. yr of H.S

After a while I ended up forgiving, not forgetting my mother for abandoning us.
My husband  and I have 2 kids together, we have been on our own since we meet, he helped me buy all my senior things, prom dress, school clothes, everything.  

Our kids are now 11 and 13 and my mom has 13 grandkids. the oldest being 18 down to 2. She has always been a selfish person, not noticing when I was younger but the older I get the more I can see it.  I also want to add nothing is ever her fault, if something happens it’s never her it’s always someone else. 

She never goes to any of the kids events. 
2 years ago her and my stepdad separated, his youngest child passed away and she left with one of the life insurance checks and moved out, after she blew the money she would call me and my siblings for money for cokes, cigs, for us to help pay her bills. I’ve always felt obligated because she’s my mom. 

She also will tell all the grandkids that she wants them to come stay with her or them go do stuff with her and never shows up. She literally told my child she needs to do laundry so she couldn’t  come over. There are so many other things I can add to this. 

Recently she got remarried. 
NOT for the right reasons she caught this man meeting up with other women at his work, She kicked him out and eventually let him come back to her house. I talked to her on a Tuesday she said they was done, over and she wasn’t letting him come back to her house and they went and got married the next day on Wednesday. 
Now she tells my sister that she doesn’t love him, she never will again and as long as he gives her money and fixes up HER house he can stay there, but as soon as he stops he’s out of there and they’re over. 

I don’t want my children to see that or think that’s how love is. 

I just don’t want to show up for someone who never has shown up for me, my children or anyone unless it benefits her. If we wouldn’t let her borrow money she wouldn’t talk to us for days, then she would text wanting something and as long as I was helping her she was calling asking how I was all the things moms do. Right now it’s been 3 weeks since I spoke to her and she only texted to ask me to help decorate the pavilion for the reception before that it has been months since I spoke to her.

148,1fauasb,AITA For refusing to play monopoly with my wife?,"My wife loves the board game monopoly. Unfortunately, my wife doesn’t love online monopoly and refuses to play it on her phone or computer and says it’s only fun with me.

About 2 months ago her family visited and we played monopoly and this was her first time playing, she had never played. She lost, but she said she wanted to play again to practice so she could beat her family next time they visit.

We played about 3 games a day, for 2 weeks straight.

If you don’t know anything about it, monopoly is not a quick board game. We would spend hours playing.

She would also get mad at me for the rest of the night if I would win, so I always avoid winning. Which is what I think is fun. 

Now recently about last month we dialed back the monopoly to about once biweekly but today she wanted to play and I told her that I am so bored and exhausted of playing monopoly that if she doesn’t want to play online then she won’t play at all. I tell her I am burnt out and she says “I know it’s boring to you but you know it’s fun to me”. I tell her I can’t last another minute playing that game and she says “You don’t care about me enough to play a board game with me” I did not yell at her but I told her sternly that I will not play monopoly with her ever again, unless there are other people playing with us.

I’m (34F) have a (35M) husband and we have a 2-year-old daughter. We live in Canada, but my family (parents and sister) are in India. My husband’s sister is getting married in February, and we were all originally planning to attend her wedding.

However, my sister’s boyfriend recently proposed, and they started planning their wedding. I suggested to my mom and sister that they plan it close to February so we could attend both weddings on the same trip. But my sister and her fiancé decided on late March, six weeks after my husband’s sister’s wedding.

It’s just not possible for us to make two trips to India within such a short time. It’s expensive, exhausting, and we don’t have enough vacation time, especially with a toddler. So, we decided my husband would attend his sister’s wedding, and I would attend my sister’s, with our daughter staying in Canada with the parent not traveling.

When I told my mom this, she got upset. She suggested I bring my daughter to my sister’s wedding, but I explained that wouldn’t work because our daughter wouldn’t be going to my husband’s sister’s wedding. This would cause drama in his family and make us look bad if she didn’t attend. My mom still thinks I’m being inconsiderate and selfish for not bringing my daughter and not attending both weddings.

She was adopted at birth because my cousin had her at a very young age, after being the victim of a well-known grooming scandal in our area. Given the circumstances, Sarah didn’t have any contact with the family until she turned 18 (two weeks ago) and reconnected with her biological mum.

After reaching out to her mum, Sarah got a couple of the other family’s details and added me on Facebook. She began messaging me straight away, despite us never having met before, and I was genuinely really happy she wanted to connect with her biological family. 

Sarah has significant intellectual disabilities and currently lives with supporting carers, though she immediately seemed to rely on me for emotional support. We’ve only known each other a short time, but she’s already leaning on me for advice and help with things I don’t feel equipped to manage.

Last week, she messaged me suddenly, saying her mum ""hates her"" and ""doesn’t love her anymore."" They’d had an argument about something or other, and Sarah was (understandably) really upset and worked up. She wanted me to get involved and sort everything out between them. The issue is, I’m not close with my cousin (her mum) at all—I only see her every few years—so I don’t feel comfortable or capable of stepping into the middle of their relationship.

To complicate things, my cousin (her mum) struggles significantly with her mental health, and I genuinely worry about their arguments. Both of them have complex issues, and I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to be involved. I tried setting some boundaries by gently suggesting that Sarah speak to her social worker, as they’re better equipped to help her. However, it’s clear she still expects me to step in when there are problems, and I feel really conflicted about it.

I feel so bad because I know she’s dealing with so much, and the fact that she has intellectual disabilities (which none of us knew about before) makes it even harder. I really don’t want to add to her sense of rejection, and it tears me up inside to think I might hurt her. But at the same time, the constant contact and the pressure to help her with things I’m not prepared to handle have become overwhelming.
