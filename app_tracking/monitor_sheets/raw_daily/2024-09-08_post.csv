0,1fcbg6q,AITA for being pissed off at one of my best friends playing something i’m upset with her about off as a joke when i bring it up?,"
i wanted to come on here and ask for some advice on what to do, bc it might seem stupid and it’s not serious enough to vent about with my friends, and i don’t wanna be an asshole to her about it. i’ve been writing for most of my life, ever since i was around 6. i loved writing and stories in general, and making characters, but i’ve been suffering from writing block for a good few months and have barely written anything i found good. so, this past week, i finally made a character i genuinely liked and found good, (we have a discord server with just the group where we talk about random stuff and play games) and it was in the server. i have no clue about what happened, but she deleted a part of her lore that i really spent a long time on. i was obviously upset, and this is where i might be an asshole, i spammed just one message which was smth like “bro after deleting my oc lore” in all the channels, so basically in each channel there was that message just once. i also made a channel titled: graveyard of my oc, and talked about it. i guess she didn’t like that very much, so she decided to kick me. i could deal with that, but i can’t deal with the fact that when she used a bot to delete my messages, it deleted another paragraph of my oc’s lore. i can’t lie, i cried about it for 2 hours straight after i got invited back in the server. i put my heart and soul into my character and even though a part of the paragraph got recovered by my other best friend, those other 2 parts are just gone. i spent abt 30-50 minutes on each, and they just went missing?? (she deleted them. ik from the audit log.) and i’ve been genuinely upset with her but she just keeps playing it off. either that, or she changes the conversation. i am a sensitive person, and they know this. i don’t think i’d care if she told me to remake my oc bc it’s too overpowered or if she didn’t like it (idk why she did remove my oc lore though..), i would try in a heartbeat because she told me about it. but she just deleted it, and i’ve been in a terrible mood ever since.",Asshole,2024-09-08,"AITA for being pissed off at one of my best friends playing something i’m upset with her about off as a joke when i bring it up?

1,1fcbbhv,AITA for not locking the bathroom door?,"So small issue, me and my sister share an apartment with only one bathroom. Every so often when I'm using the bathroom, she'll open the door without even knocking and I'll have to say something before she opens it and sees me on the toilet. Every time this happens, she gives me crap for not locking the door.

My problem with this is, the lights are ON when I'm in the bathroom. We never leave the lights on in the bathroom when we're not in there, and it's very easy to tell when the lights are on or off. That's how I usually tell if someone is in there, and if I suspect there's no-one in there with the lights on anyway, THEN I knock before trying to open the door.

She thinks my way of figuring out if someone is in the bathroom is stupid and I should just lock the door when I'm using the bathroom so that when she goes to open it, there isn't a chance of her seeing me on the toilet. Which yeah, I *could* do that but I wouldn't even need to if she just knocked or looked to see if the lights were on in the first place. When I'm going to the bathroom, I immediately head to sit down, and I've never had this problem with anyone else before.

It happened again recently and we got into an argument about it, at which point she told me to post the situation on here and see what yall think.

3,1fcaxv0,AITA for not buying my sisters expensive gifts anymore? ,"I am the eldest of 5 siblings (4 sisters and 1 brother) and there is a 10-17 year age gap between my dad's children with his now ex wife  (3girls) and myself. Since the day my  dad's kids were born I have always gotten them gifts (birthdays, Easter, Christmas, and graduations) but my sisters have never gotten me anything which is fine because they were all children. I was getting babysitting money from watching my moms and dads kids during the week and weekends so I understood they were not given an allowance to buy it with and my dad would never think to give them money to get me a gift from them. 

I never cared that they didn't get me anything, but I did care that they didn't appreciate the gifts I gave them. They always wanted expensive things and my budget was 25-60 per sibling and maybe 80 tops for my parents. My sisters would expect gifts that were 150+ and didn't care about anything less, they only want brand names. 

My boyfriend mentioned this week (since it's my sisters birthday) that we should get her a purse from the coach outlet store since they are only $200.

 I told him no I'm not comfortable spending that much on one sister (I would have to get them all the same value from now on). I also told him that lately I don't think they really deserve any gifts from me anyway.

 He thinks that they will appreciate the more expensive things and then might finally reciprocate with me. 





The main incident that has stopped me from getting them gifts was 2 years ago. I haven't been home for Christmas since and probably won't be going again this year. 

2 years ago I went home for Christmas to find my ex stepmom had been invited as well even though she and my dad are divorced. We did all the gifts and at the end my dad's ex wife decided to ask my sister why she didn't get me anything in front of the whole family. She went on about how my sister got everyone else something but not me. And my sister just said ""well I didn't care to get her anything"" and they both laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard. I laughed too in the moment so they wouldn't know I was hurt but I went home feeling like I never wanted to see them again. 
My sister had recently gotten a job since she was 18 at the time so she had the money but she just didn't care and that hurt but it also hurt that she thought it was okay to laugh and humiliate me.


My stepmom always disliked me and while she wasarrired to my dad she would tell me on Christmas that my gifts would suck because she only bought gifts for my sisters and my dad was bad at getting gifts.  She would try to make an example out of me that my dad was a neglectful parent because he wasn't helping her with her kids and would set me up to fail to prove to him he was a bad dad.


I don't think they deserve me or my time let alone getting expensive gifts. I don't visit often anymore, just once a year.

I was driving when my mom and my fiancée were talking about preparing on the day of our wedding next summer. My fiancée asked if my mom would like to help her get ready, and she said yes. Then, my fiancée began to list all of the people who would be in the bridal suite on the day of the wedding, and my mom said, ‘you might change your mind, we can always come back to that.’ She felt it would be too many people in the bridal suite and it could be overwhelming (that was my grip on how she meant it while I was driving).

On the way home, I asked my fiancée if today went better than usual with my mom (the relationship between them has been rocky previously). She told me, ‘if you are asking, you didn’t pick up on it earlier.’ My fiancée sort of blew up that I didn’t defend her and set a boundary with my mom, and I tried to explain how I didn’t understand the context where a boundary was required.

5,1fcalpe,AITA for asking my friends to contribute to travel expenses with a petrol allowance instead of just splitting the fuel cost?,"A bit of context: Recently, I took a road trip with my girlfriend and her best friend. It was a special trip since my girlfriend is leaving the country for four months to study abroad, and her best friend is heading off to travel the world. We decided to go camping in France and Germany together, and I was the one driving.

I ended up covering all the costs for petrol and drove over 1300 km in my own car. Now that the trip is over and I’m calculating the expenses, I’m considering asking my girlfriend and her friend to contribute not just by splitting the fuel bill, but by paying me a per-kilometer allowance, like companies do when reimbursing for travel.

In the Netherlands, companies can pay up to €0.23 per km to cover fuel, wear and tear, oil, mileage, etc. I feel like this would be a fairer way to split the cost, as the fuel consumption increases when I speed or drive in less efficient conditions, but the distance traveled remains the same. Essentially, I’m bearing all the extra costs associated with wear and tear on my car, while they’re just contributing to the fuel.

AITA for asking them to pay based on a per-kilometer rate instead of just splitting the fuel cost?

*EDIT: Most people agree that ITA. In hindsight, I should have discussed this prior to the trip. However, this trip was more about the girls saying goodbye to eachother, as my gf and I had a small trip a few days before this one. As she is my partner, I ussually don't really care too much about paying something for her. Though I pay often and are never a scrooch about anything if it regards her. Or my friends, for that matter. But in the event of a 3-person trip, where all expenses are shared equally or are pre-paid by someone and settled later, there is a different dynamic at play.*

*Also, there was no said budget. We just drove to a certain destination and made up the plans as we went. - Saying that ITA because of potentially presenting them a bill higher than expected: one of them spends all her spare time in the pub with her friends, the other really enjoys traveling and has done so a lot in the last few years. So both could've saved a lot more money without much efforts.*

*Also also, please stop talking about 'legal' stuff. They are both near and dear to me and they will undoubtly pay the bill for the petrol. I'm just always the one ending up driving and using my car. It just has never been to this extend, with this much luggage and on these types of terrains.*

7,1fca5ts,AITA for not aceepting my friend's open-ended invitations to visit?,"For some background; I lost my dad to cancer this April, and to say it's been devestating has been an understatement. During the recent months I've moved out of my childhood home, helped clean it out, moved into a new place, and we had his celebration of life. 

During this time my friend, we'll call her M, has been supportive by keeping in touch with me, and just being an ear when I needed to vent. For additional context M has 3 kids and recently started a new job, so I know her free time is limited.  We would message each other a lot on insta, and she would often invite me to church. I'm not much of a church goer anymore, but when we did meet at church we'd have coffee and talk before service, and that was our visiting time. M would also message me and tell me when she was home saying things like, ""we're home today if you want to come over."" Or ""want to just come over? I just need someone to watch the kids for 20mins while I run an errand.""

I'll admit that I'm really struggling to leave the apartment at times. Sometimes it just feels safer to stay home. I miss my dad everyday, and I'm not really that close to the rest of family. My dad was my buddy. Even when M would tell me she was home, I thought it was an open ended, no obligation type of invite, so sometimes I would go, but I've been getting out less and sless. Now I'm wondering if I offended her by not going? At one point last week. I let her know I was gonna take a break from insta because it's just too toxic, but let her know we could keep in touch via text. I texted her asking if she would like to hang out if she happens to be child free, or with the kids is ok too. She never responded to that text. However, she liked some pics of mine on intsta and when I asked her if she happened to see my text, she again didn't respond. I asked her if we're good and she said yeah just busy, but I feeel like shee's pulling away. Am I the asshole?

I'll admit that I'm really struggling to leave the apartment at times. Sometimes it just feels safer to stay home. I miss my dad everyday, and I'm not really that close to the rest of family. My dad was my buddy. Even when M would tell me she was home, I thought it was an open ended, no obligation type of invite, so sometimes I would go, but I've been getting out less and sless. Now I'm wondering if I offended her by not going? At one point last week. I let her know I was gonna take a break from insta because it's just too toxic, but let her know we could keep in touch via text. I texted her asking if she would like to hang out if she happens to be child free, or with the kids is ok too. She never responded to that text. However, she liked some pics of mine on intsta and when I asked her if she happened to see my text, she again didn't respond. I asked her if we're good and she said yeah just busy, but I feeel like shee's pulling away. Am I the asshole?

8,1fc9wje,AITA for not giving my little cousin a toy?,"When I was a kid, I saved up money for quite some time because I wanted to buy a fairly expensive (around 1500 USD) RC Car that I wanted. I saved the money and bought the RC Car I always dreamt about. It was one of the best feelings I can remember from my childhood. I used it a lot and since I played always outside I cleaned it up after every use.

Fast forward 20 years, my wife and I (28 y/o Man) decided to move to Europe, and that meant quite some preparation time, deciding what to sell, what to keep, what to give away, etc. We spent some time on it, and after we had almost everything ready, I still had to decide what to do with my RC Car.

After giving it some thought, I decided to give it to someone who would play with it and care for it like I did. Taking it with me didn´t make that much sense, and selling it after so many years would make even less sense. It had a lot of sentimental value. I just had to find the right person.

After considering it, I thought that my little Cousin (let´s call him Ben - he was 6 y/o) would be perfect for it. I was extremely happy about that because he loves to play outside and enjoys everything car-related.

My family threw a goodbye party for us three days before moving, and I took the RC car with me and planned to give it to Ben at some point during the party. While we were there, I took the car out of the box and played with it for one last time. The kids saw me do it, and I gave Ben the remote control to see how he played with it. He played for like two hours and he enjoyed it so much.

Here is the tricky part. After playing with it, he came to me, and before I could say anything he said ""Give it to me!"", I said ""Sorry, what?"", he replied ""Yeah, I think i´m just gonna keep it. You are moving to Europe anyways, and you probably don´t have any more space in your luggage. I will just keep it."" After thinking about it for like 15 seconds, I replied ""No. I will probably sell it, since it was a super expensive RC Car"". I took it with me and put it in the box again. The car ment a lot to me so I didn´t think Ben was worthy of the gift. He acted kind of entitled, and ruined the moment in my oppinion.

My wife saw the whole thing, and she knew my plan of giving Ben the Car, so she looked confused. After the party she told me I was sort of an asshole and that I should have just given him the toy anyways. He is just a kid.

Once in a while this topic comes up in the family and we cannot decide if I´m the asshole or not. So, AITA for not giving my little cousin a toy?

EDIT:

- I saved the money over two and a half years, saving all of my allowances, all my birthdays money, and the money my grandparents gave me at some times. It was very hard, but I had my goal set.

- I don´t remember word for word what Ben told me in his words. I understand how that might be confusing. He definitely said it in more of a 6 y old language. Mabye something like ""Your bags are full, and closed. This car is not in your bags. So I´m going to keep it."" Or something like that.

Me and my 2 friends (f 20) go out alot in the summer  (we study in different cities so this is the time that we can hang out). I am single and my friends have a boyfriend. The difference between them is that the one bf lives in another city and the other lives in our city. So naturaly the one that lives close by ( m 27) would join us from time to time when we went out. And here is the thing. Me and the other friend dont like her boyfriend (he is toxic, controling and a gaslighter) . At first we were somewhat okay with him comming with us sometimes but the past year he has done some questionable things that left me and my friend feeling uncomfortable and angry. He cant get over his gf making out with ONE GUY a YEAR before they started dating for some reason so he made her call me and our friend (and he was listening in the backround) and ask us if we remember her doing this. This making out happened 3 YEARS AGO im not even kidding. He called her a h*e and used for that. The past months she has been asking us to delete mesagges so that he wont see them bc they dont even trust each other. 
They constantly fight ab the same thing for 2 years. And its a ridiculus thing to fight over tbh. I dont know why he is so insecure. Its not like my friend is giving him reasons to doubt her or something. 
It has reached a point where i cant even text my friend freely bc i have to constantly be mindful of the situation that her bf might see the mesagges.

All of these things are just the tip of the iceberg

So the drama started when my other friend's bf (m 20) came to our city to visit her. I really like her bf he treats her right and he is a good man overall. So we said to go out and the friend told us that she will bring her bf as well. Mind that noone else likes ger bf exept herself mainly bc he makes us uncomfortble (he also has like a bad aura i cant explain it). So we said to her that we dont want him tagging along and she was a bit mad.
About a week later she told me that she is really annoyed that we dont want him tagging along, especially when our other friend brought her bf. She said that he is the man that she chose and we have to accept it. 

(I also have to say that it was a bit rare to go out the 3 of us this summer bc we were all working so we had limited times when the 3 of us went out. On the other side my friend and her bf would see each other like 5 times a week AND she wanted him to join us when we went out)

But do i and my other friend have to feel uncomfortable and be annoyed when we go out once in a while together? I much rather prefer to have peace when i go out.

13,1fc92oq,AITA for setting my fantasy football lineup during my wife’s grandma’s funeral?,"Before you judge, here is the story:

My wife’s grandmother passed away late Wednesday evening. The family decided to have the funeral service today (Sunday) as opposed to going into next week. 

During the funeral service, I get a loud ping on my phone. Assuming it was an email or social media notification i was embarrassed that I forgot to silence my phone and went to switch it to vibrate. But upon opening it I saw a notification from ESPN that said Ja’Marr Chase was active for today’s game against New England.

Now, this was at 12:55 and the game started at 1, so I wasn’t left with much choice. I made a quick change to the lineup because I didn’t want to accidentally bench my first round pick. My wife saw me doing this and got so upset she walked out in the middle of the service crying. 

She told me what I did was rude & disrespectful. I tried to explain to her that this league has a $250 buy-in, but she just got more upset with me. I also pointed out that her getting up and storming out caused WAY more of a scene than me setting my lineup and she hasn’t spoken to me since. 

I honestly don’t see what the big deal was, it was a Catholic funeral service and we aren’t even Catholic. It’s not like I was sending a long winded text message, checking Facebook, or watching TikTok videos.

When I ask why, they give me some BS excuse about it being a bad time for visitors. I plead; they refuse. ""You're not welcome"" they say. She dies the next day. They hold a funeral a few days later. They send me messages saying they expect me to come out to ""support the family in their grief."" I say fuck that, since I'm not welcome, you won't be seeing me ever again. Have a nice life.

17,1fc8nmp,AITA for calling my boyfriend out for messaging his ex right before he was about to propose to me?,"So, here's the situation. My boyfriend (well, *was* going to be fiancé) {22m} recently started messaging his ex again. For context, she's part of his old friend group that he occasionally keeps in touch with. At first, I {20f} didn't think much of it because I trust him, and I understand they have mutual friends. But over the past few weeks, I noticed their conversations seemed to be happening more frequently, and he would get all secretive when messaging her.

Naturally, this made me feel suspicious and uncomfortable. I tried to brush it off, thinking maybe I was overreacting. But it kept eating at me, and I felt like something was up.

Fast forward to a few days ago, we went out for a romantic dinner. I noticed he was fidgety and acting kind of weird. In the middle of dinner, I couldn't hold it in anymore. I asked him directly why he felt the need to start messaging his ex so much and why he was being so secretive about it. He got this shocked look on his face, and then he... pulled out a ring.

Apparently, he had been planning to propose to me, and I had just interrupted his proposal with my suspicions. He got really upset and said I had ruined the moment and made him feel like I didn't trust him at all. The rest of the night was tense, and he ended up calling off the proposal altogether.

Now I feel terrible because I know I could have waited, but at the same time, his behavior was making me feel so insecure and anxious. I just wanted some honesty and reassurance.

Anyway he skates right across my path and I don't really have time to swerve or stop with my limited skills so I took a knee which hurt like hell.

I'm not going to be the one to argue to some broken kids parents that it was the child's fault for skating in front of me. I said that we're adults and expected to be a little more considerate of others than a 4 year old so it'd probably end up being painted as my fault whether it's the kids or not. But she stuck to her guns claiming she'd do exactly what she said.

Anyway, things got pretty heating over the course of the conversation, cursing, etc. So I just left.

21,1fc85h1,AITA for wanting more say in household finances after originally giving up access?,"I have BPD and about 10 years ago I (36F) was in an incredibly low point which manifested in extreme binge eating and overspending (amongst other things not really relevant). I never got into debt but I would spend every penny I had on junk and struggled to sort bills etc. Eventually I gave my bank card etc to my partner (36M) so that he could manage the bills and finances. 

Since then I have got medication and therapy and, while I obviously still struggle. Im in a much better place

However now we are in a position where it has gradually become me having to ask for any money and justify any spending. For example if I go out with the kids I need to account for all the money I will need while out and only that amount will be put on the card. If I see anything while out I need to message to request the money. 

Meanwhile he spends money with complete impunity to the point of racking up credit card debts and having 0 money in the account because he has spent it all on tools or other things he wants. He never really tells me this, but I checked Amazon etc and physically added up 3-4 k being spent on random stuff over a couple months

I feel now this defeats the purpose of me giving up access to finances in the first place snd I have been badgering for ages to manage finances jointly.

I've suggested a system where monthly income us divided into bills / food / necessities, an emergency saving account and then both having equal ""pocket money"" to use as we will. Be it saving it, spending it. Going out. Whatever. 

He however resists this, constantly saying its too hard? Not that simple and that I'll just waste all the money.

Every time I suggest it it devolves into an argument and nothing ever gets resolved.

Then the dolorous stroke was struck. I took a two week long vacation. Meanwhile, my friend kept playing the game. When I came back, I was shocked to see that he had surpassed me; he could now defeat me at the game. At first I pretended to him that I was still on vacation and hence lagging because of regional differences. But he kept beating me. Eventually I put of the act of still being on vacation and admitted that this whole time I was already back in the country when I went against him. I asked him if he thought I was untalented, and he responded with 'idk, maybe?' I later asked him if he thought I was bad and he said 'I think you're a bit below average but if you work really hard you can be great at the game!'

I understand what he said was meant to be comforting, but I took it as him telling me I was untalented, that I was one of those people who had to supplement a lack of talent with hard work. I started becoming bitter and insecure around him, since he could beat me despite starting the game later, which suggests a talent difference (though that may or may not be the case.) Moreover, he himself had suggested I was untalented. I ended up having many arguments with him and his friends about talent and other topics. Eventually our friendship crumbled completely and I became his nemesis.

26,1fc7fxb,WIBTA if I spend a night with my other BFF during my other friend's bachelorette weekend?,"My best friend (the bride) is having her bachelorette party in NYC, where my long-distance BFF (friends since childhood) also lives. The party runs from Thursday night through Sunday, but I’m flying in really late Thursday night because I’m coming from a different state than everyone else. I live far from both the bride and my BFF, and only get to see my BFF maybe once or twice a year. We haven’t seen each other in almost 10 months, while I see the bride far more frequently. 

Thursday night’s plans are super casual—just a wine and pizza night in—and the other nights are much more involved. My BFF lives just 5 minutes away from where we’re staying, and since I’m arriving late, I thought it would be a good opportunity to catch up with her for a few hours before fully joining the main bachelorette activities on Friday. I’d love to take advantage of being so close to her, especially since I don’t have enough PTO to add extra days just to see her.

When I mentioned possibly seeing my long distance BFF Thursday night, bride seemed excited about the plans on Thursday night, and now I’m sensing she might be a bit hurt if I peel away for even a little bit. I don’t want to upset her, but I also won’t have another opportunity to see my long-distance BFF for a while. I plan to be fully engaged in all the bachelorette activities Friday-Sunday.

Hello all, I (21F) had a crush on my old best-friend (22M). We had been friends for many years but in the most recent years developed a flirty-jokey relationship. I used to sit on his lap at parties and we texted and FaceTime all night. All of my other friends told me he had a crush on me, and I had one on him. One night after going out to the club we stayed at a friends house. Him and I ended up sharing a bed and we cuddled and spooned all night. This became the regular occurrence when staying at friends houses. I finally mustered the courage to tell him how I feel after being encouraged by the other friends in the group that he felt the same way. He laughed and said we were just friends and he never saw me like that. I was heartbroken and went to my other friends crying, who intern all fell out with him and blocked him for leading me on. He has been blowing up my phone calling me an AH for ruining the friend group.

31,1fc6tli,AITA for getting sick after a festival ? ,"So I (18) just got back from a two nights festival, where I was staying at the camping site with friends. I got back around 1pm and we would be leaving for a BBQ with my grandpa, aunt and uncle at 4pm. I took a shower and then a nap because I hadn't really been able to do that there, for obvious reasons. My sister (16) woke me up from my nap to tell me that we were leaving but when I opened my eyes, I felt incredibly nauseous, still very tired and sick, so I told her that I didn't feel well and probably wouldn't be able to attend the bbq. My dad understood but I could hear my mom yelling downstairs, she was not pleased since she has a cold (for about 4 days now) and was still going. 

I fell back asleep and woke up a few hours later, still incredibly unwell and now with added back pain and leg pain (I had none of these symptons this morning when I woke up or when we were carrying all our stuff to the car). I went to the toilet and threw up all the water I had drank and then went back to bed. 

My family (mom, dad and my sister) came back and since I had been craving some comfort the entire time I was alone and sick, I asked for my dad. But I could hear him yelling with my mom downstairs and she said I needed to wait. Then, half an hour later, he came to my room but instead of being comforting, he seemed dissapointed and mad. He asked if I had drank too much or taken any drugs (I did none of those things). I said I had just drunk a bit of water from the tap at the festival, even though it said non drinkable because I was really thirsty and there was no other water nearby. 

He started saying that it was my fault that I was sick and that he and my mum were angry that I didn't go to the bbq, and that I should have been smarter and not have done that because I knew the bbq was today. So I replied that I knew it wasn't the smartest thing to do but other friends drank from it too and they are all fine, and the first time that I drank from it was friday and I felt completely normal until now. He kept saying that I shouldn't have taken risks like that and that he never would have done such a thing if he knew there was a bbq the next day. 

I started crying and told him to go away, which he did. Mom hasn't even said a word to me since she came back from the bbq. I feel like shit because all I wanted was some comfort but I also kinda understand that I did something wrong, I just feel like my physical and emotional health comes before that.

33,1fc6m6l,AITA for stopping my boyfriend going out,"Throway to try and stay anonymous.

I(f34) have been living with my boyfriend (35) for a year now. I work as a senior leader in a secondary school in England. My job is stressful and the days can be intense, I am often dealing with parents, complex young people, other professionals including social workers and even lawyers. My boyfriend is currently between jobs, he has a background in media. Despite this, he is able to still pay half of the rent and bills every month. 

The biggest issue of our relationship is that he likes going out in the week with his friends, most often on a Thursday. These friends have jobs in which it doesn’t matter too much if they rock up hungover after a late one. I cannot (and don’t want to) do that. I need a decent nights sleep in the week but my boyfriend’s weeknight escapades see him often coming home as late as 4am. More often it’s around 1am but still very late for me. He comes home drunk, usually wakes me up and then snores loudly. He will say he will try to be home early, sometimes even texting in the night saying he’s leaving shortly. It’ll be hours later, I’ll wake up and see he’s still not home and worry. This leads to arguments over text, I’m angry and therefore cannot get back to sleep. Cue a rough morning and a difficult day in work due to exhaustion.

This all came to a head when it happened this Thursday. We went out for dinner with two of his friends, I told him I was apprehensive as I had work the next day and it was the first week back so even busier than usual. He assured me he would come home straight after dinner with me. This didn’t happen - I went home at 10 and awoke at midnight to him not home. We argued via text, he arrived home at 1:30. I had a shit day the next day.
The next day we had a big discussion where I basically said I thought it unfair and disrespectful towards me. He knows I have to be up early for work and he can go out on the weekends. He said from now on he wouldn’t have late nights on weeknights. Amazing.

Then today happens… he meets the same friend from Thursday night for a lunch time beer. They’re out until 5 drinking. Boyfriend comes home for a couple of hours, plays on his xbox, then at 8pm asks if he can go for a beer with the same friend. He says he’s being respectful by asking and that he’ll be home by 10:30.
I don’t want to stop him from going out…but also it’s the first weeknight after our big row where he agreed not to go out late. I know 10:30 isn’t late and I’m completely fine with that. I’m just feeling shitty that this is the first night and he’s gone out. His history of not being home at the time he says he will be is playing on my mind.

In the last couple of years she barely tries to meet me and if I suggest it she often says she's not available even though I see her meeting up with other friends a lot. 

I tried to arrange something recently and it seemed obvious she wasn't keen so I asked what's wrong and why she hardly wants to meet me. She said that it's because I only ever want to meet in mornings and usually just want it to be at my house sitting on my sofa talking. 

She said she's not a morning person but doesn’t mind going out for something nice like brunches which is one of the things I see her doing a lot with others. She said otherwise she just doesn't enjoy meeting up in the mornings and finds it boring just sitting in my living room talking, that she’s happy to do it occasionally if that’s what I prefer but after all these years she’s tired of this being our social life and taking time from her day for it specially. 

She said she's tried to organise meals out in the evening with me, coffee meet ups in the afternoon and also morning brunches somewhere, but that I just always make it clear I want to meet at my house (and sometimes hers) and that it’s okay to do that once in awhile to catch up but if that’s all we do it feels really awkward and not exactly her idea of fun. 

I said I’ve seen her going to other people’s houses too, sometimes even in the late morning. and she said yes and hesitated and then said that those people actually host with a little spread of food and drinks and make it a fun social event and there’s more people there too. I said obviously that’s not fair as it’s just us two in our scenario but I have tried to invite a mutual friend before, and that I always offer her a tea/coffee when she comes. She said yes I do and that she’s not complaining but it’s not the same and there’s a big difference. 

I also explained how I have agreed to meet with her for a meal out or a coffee meet before, she said she can count those on one hand after all these years and that she’s tired of always having to try to convince me and not getting anywhere and that she’s accepted that I just want to only socialise in my own way and she finds it hard to make the effort for these meet ups which she doesn’t enjoy.

It was an awkward conversation and not exactly pleasant for me but I guess it was honest. I honestly never saw anything wrong with our meet ups, to me they were just nice catch ups with a friend.

37,1fc5x6u,AITA for re-setting boundaries with my soon to be mother in law?,"I sent a mass group text to everyone in my fiancés family regarding an issue we’ve been experiencing a lot recently. We’ve told everyone since the beginning that our daughter is not allowed to be left alone at anyone’s home without us present. The text I sent out read as follows, (my daughters name has been removed for obvious reasons)

“Hello everyone, I would just like to address a reoccurring issue as of recent. I would like to remind everyone that NO ONE has been given the option to watch (daughter) at any house, event, or in any environment other than the comfort of her home. This has been something that we have made everyone aware of, but we somehow continue to run into this issue. So, just so everyone is on the same page. (Daughter) is not staying at anyone’s home without us present unless we say otherwise. (Daughter) is not going to any event without us present unless we say otherwise. We ask that you respect our choices as her parents, and not question or pressure us to reconsider a firm boundary we have set for our daughter. I’m sending this with as much love and compassion as possible, please respect our wishes. Have a great weekend!”

For context, a comment was made away from me that we should allow my daughter who is 18 months old, to stay the night at their home. When my fiancé said no, she replied with “Well she’s going to ask to stay the night one day, and you’ll just have to get over that”. This obviously struck a nerve with me. I honestly expected nothing short of confirmation, but instead I recieved a text from my mother in law (we’ll call her Karen), explaining that she has had enough with me. Keep in mind, this is the first time I’ve ever came out and said anything to anyone about anything regarding my daughter. She claimed in this text that everyone feels the need to “walk on eggshells” around me because of my “rules and boundaries” and that I’ve kept her from having any type of relationship with her granddaughter. I’ve allowed “Karen” to come and go as she pleases. She continued her rant about I took my daughter to stay at my friends home with me when my fiancé and I got into it over a personal matter, and how that wasn’t okay if she couldn’t be trusted alone with her. “Karen” has recently remarried to a man who was just released from prison after 20 years. They’ve been together for a year, whilst I’ve been around for five. No, I do not trust leaving my daughter around him. She also does not have the best track record with her son (my fiancee) for reasons I will not disclose due to the fact that I haven’t talked to him about making this post on here.

38,1fc5qzh,AITA for 'ruining' my cousin's prom?,"This is a throwaway account because my family knows my main. All names are fake. This has already happened and she's won't let it go.

I [24F] own a dress that was passed down from my grandmother to my mother (her only daughter to 4 boys) and then to myself. It was a gift from my grandfather for their first anniversary. She loved it so much that she had only worn it once before she put it away, preserving it. 

By the time my mother's prom came around, grandma had passed away. Mom wore the dress as an homage to her.

To clarify, all cousins mentioned are from my maternal side and I'm the oldest of them. 

When the time came for my prom, I asked and wore the dress as well. It's a timeless piece imo, and I love the sentiment behind it. One of my cousins, Cara, wanted to join in on the tradition when her prom happened. Back then, I asked my mom who told me that the dress belongs to me now, I'm free to do whatever I want with it as long as I take care of it.

And so, I said yes to Cara and then another cousin named Maddie.

All of us are similarly sized and we each had the dress professionally altered to fit our styles and trends, nothing permanent and easily reversible for the next person who might want to wear it. 

My cousin, Ava [20F] and her sister Zoe [18F ] are the focus of my post. 

When Ava was in her junior year, my uncle and his wife went through a nasty, brutal divorce and it had affected her deeply and she dropped out of school. We all knew she wanted to join in on the tradition, so when she got her GED, all of us cousins decided to throw her a surprise photoshoot with the dress/ celebration so she doesn't feel left out. 

That was that or so we thought.

Zoe had her prom this year and had asked for the dress at the beginning of the year. Months passed and she hadn't told me anything or even mentioned her prom which I found weird. (Yes, we're that type of family.)

Zoe was dating a senior guy last year and she had been his date to his prom. She got a dress for it and was saving our family dress for hers.

A few months ago, I got a call from Ava asking when she could pick up the dress to take to the shop and get it altered to her liking. 

I asked her what she meant and she gleefully revealed that she's going to Zoe's prom instead of Zoe because she never got a 'real' experience and Zoe got hers last year by going to her boyfriend's. 

I got upset because I knew Zoe wouldn't give up her prom unless she was guilt tripped. I immediately said no which turned into a screaming match I'm not proud of. 

My uncle and his ex-wife called and berated me. 
My mom and other cousins are on my side. Zoe ended up going to her prom in the dress but felt guilty. Ava, of course, thinks I'm the wicked witch of the west, even now, and tried to confront me again at  family event yesterday which I managed to shut down real quick.

Relatives are telling me to make it better. AITA?

 So for context my mother (41F) and my step-father (48M) met online on instagram and quickly started talking, my mom and I were very close then and she was talking about him like how i (14F) talked about my bf (15m) when I met him and I was glad she was getting back out to the dating world as she had been engaged 5 time before (3 times to my bio father and 2 to other men that I never met) they went on 2 dates before he proposed and they got married last month (4 months into dating) it was quick and a bit sudden for me as I met him like 3 times but I was happy for her 

last week he got home from babysitting to find half my stuff in the living room and her moving my bed into the living room, I was hella confused and asked her what was going on and she said that her husband was moving in and she needed the room to herself (we live in a 2 bedroom apartment and I shared my room with her for all of my life as my grandmother (67F) is in the other room and has it full of things she hordes, I was upset that she gave me no warning and pointed out that I have no privacy at all, the next day she hung curtains to “give me privacy” and moved her husband in and it’s been hell since, I can hear our neighbor a talking in the halls, my mother watches movies at full volume no headphones on when I’m reading, I can smell and hear my step father cook at 6am for work and i can hear them having sex in the shower every goddamn night!

I always had a good relationship with my siblings and my parents. My parents always told me I was the best older sibling and how they loved that I never said no to my siblings doing stuff with me. Whether it was video games or football or martial arts. My parents always encouraged inclusion and doing stuff together. Sometimes it can be a little much but I never liked saying anything because I knew it made my parents proud and being ""the best big brother"" was all I had that was me. My siblings were always better at the things we did together and even stuff that started as my thing, became their thing more. And sometimes this could lead to unfairness. Like it would be if someone was doing good in their video game they could play longer. I'm not that good at video games. I just enjoy them. So that means I get less time to play. Or I'm always the first out if we play together. I never cared as much about football. That was something my parents wanted me and my brother in. But it was still difficult to hear that I should be more talented like him.

That sounds shitty, I know. 

Anything I expressed an interest in, my parents would ask if I was okay with including my siblings but they'd always add on that they knew with me being the best brother I wouldn't say no but they'd always ask. So I'd say yes because again, it was the one thing I had going for me it felt like. My siblings had their things that were just for them though.

Two years ago my friend talked about this place near him that did free dance classes. He went and asked if I wanted to go. I thought it sounded really cool so I'd tell my parents I was going to his house and we'd do the classes together. We did different types of dance but I really fell in love with it... which made me want to keep it for me alone. So I never told my family about it. 

They found out a few days ago because a local Facebook page covered the free classes and I was mentioned as one of their brightest talents. I had no idea about it until my parents said it. They were shocked and asked me about it and wanted to know why I didn't tell them. So I came clean about everything and how I felt. My parents told me it made no sense for me to feel that way because I love my siblings and I should love sharing everything like this with them. They told me something like that would be perfect for all four of us to do because it's free and fun. They said I had always been such a good big brother and why was I now pushing my siblings away. They also told me I let them down as a son.

My brother was the only person who didn't care at all. At first he was dismissive until I opened up to him and then he got it. My sisters are coming around. But my parents are mad that I kept it from them but they're also mad I didn't want to include my siblings.

41,1fc5iwt,AITA for not discussing my income with father and grandmother because they take care of me financially?,"Some context. 

So I(21m) moved countries, from Europe back to the UK, my father(46m) and my GM(84f) told me I should come live with them. So I started a new job in middle management, at a retail store. 

I discussed with my father that I would like to pay rent, shopping, etc. we had that agreement but later on when I got paid and wanted to go over what I owe him, he refused to take my money and told me he doesn’t want me to pay anything at all since he never paid child support or anything 

He bought me a 2006 car, nothing fancy, just something reliable to help me get around, he doesn’t let me pay the insurance, only thing I pay for is fuel, which is not a lot since it is a diesel and has high MPG, but that’s besides the point. 

Grandmother doesn’t agree with what my father is doing and neither do I, however, she constantly keeps asking about how much money I make, how much money I have, and how much money I spend. 
This has been going on for a while now and I never really reply anything other than vague answers, like I’m not sure, depends on overtime, or I don’t splurge too much, etc.

That kind of conversation is taboo for me, talking about finances makes me uncomfortable, I grew up with my mom and her family and it’s something I picked up from them. 

I was taking GM and father to shop for some groceries, in the car my GM bluntly said, “I’m curious how much you will get paid on payday”. I replied saying “I understand curiosity but I respect both of you and your privacy which is why I don’t ask you questions about something that isn’t my business so please let’s keep a boundary”

I’m guessing they both took that in an offensive way, my father and GM both came for me, telling me that I’m acting shady and secretive, my father also said “no one is going to take your money stop being such an asshole about it”

I simply told them after that that I don’t agree with discussing finances, and that I will not discuss mine. 

They are both angry with me, which I just don’t understand why, it’s like discussing my sexual interests, I don’t want to talk about it, not to anyone. 

I never wanted to be taken care of financially, it’s out of my reach. I know I could move out, but until my probationary period is over, I won’t risk getting a flat and being let go if the company chooses not to proceed with my employment for whatever reason.

43,1fc4zub,AITA for telling a new vendor his English is better than my Thai during a business call? ,"
I (35M) live in Canada and run a business that works with partners across the world. Recently, my business partner and I were on a video call with a new vendor from Thailand. The vendor seemed nervous, probably because it was our first meeting, and English isn’t his first language. However, he was speaking very well, though he apologized a few times for his English not being ""good enough.""

At one point, after apologizing again for his English, I tried to ease the tension by saying, ""Honestly, your English is way better than my Thai, so I really appreciate the effort. I should be the one who’s grateful."" I thought this was a nice way to acknowledge his effort and put him at ease, especially since I know how intimidating it can be to communicate in a second language. He seemed to relax after that, and the call continued without any further issues. In fact, I thought things went pretty smoothly.

However, after the call, my business partner pulled me aside and told me that my comment was patronizing and that it came across as infantilizing. He said I should have just responded with something like, ""No problem, your English is fine,"" instead of comparing his language skills to my non-existent Thai. My partner felt that what I said might have made the vendor feel worse or embarrassed, even though that wasn’t my intention at all. 

I honestly thought I was being polite and showing empathy, especially since working with people across different cultures and languages is something I do regularly. I’ve used similar phrases in the past with other international partners without issue, but now I’m wondering if I misread the situation this time. 

My goal was just to show that I appreciated his effort and didn’t expect perfect English, but now I’m second-guessing myself. Was my comment patronizing or offensive? Should I have just said, ""No problem,"" and left it at that?

I told them I did not want them speeding at all and expressed how dangerous it is. They could kill someone, they could kill themselves.

I expressed today that it actively made me unsafe and again begged them to stop. If they were going to do that, I did not want to be in the car and said so.

It escalated to a lot of tension as they continued to do it. One low key acted like I was the fun police, the other said they wouldn’t rent cool cars anymore in a shitty tone, implying I’m the reason they can’t rent nice cars. 

They eventually brought it down to 80 on the drive home. 

I expressed it over and over that this was my boundary and I did not feel safe, at all. I was miserable, I don’t want to be in a car going 120+ and they just kept doing it anyway.

45,1fc4eg8,AITA for refusing to continue hosting parties for my family?,"I (26F) love hosting parties for my family. I'm usually the one in charge of Christmas and most birthdays are celebrated at my home. I love doing nice and elaborate parties. I usually plan a menu, make everything from scratch, decorate, for Christmas I started doing secret santa and depending on the event even some games or karaoke.

Before I started doing this, my family used to do pretty normal events. Just one meal like a basic bbq, buying pizza, a traditional food and buying a cake for dessert. Never decorated and the parties were just about showing up, eating and leaving. There was nothing wrong with that but I love Christmas so about 4 years ago I decided I was going to host for once and did it as I mentioned. Everyone loved it and were praising me for everything. With the years I've definitely improved my cooking and party planning skills and honestly I'm very proud of what I do. They liked it so much that they started asking that for some birthdays if I could host a party as a gift for them and I happily did. It's important to mention that my main family is only 9 or 10 pleople so it's not too much for me to handle or too expensive.

Now to the issue. The last parties I've been hosting which were the last Christmas, my mom's, uncle's and aunt's birthdays and my husband's birthday as the most recent, they have gotten what I concider a nasty attitude.

For example, I would send proper invites clearly stating that the party would start at 3:30pm. Well, they would show up at 12pm and comment how I wasn't ready. For my husband's party they saw that the decorations were half way done and started asking why the food wasn't ready (I had told them it was an early dinner but decided to show up without having eating lunch) and to just give up with the decorations and start cooking cause I was being rude by letting them be hungry.

Long story short, they started eating random stuff and everyone pressured me into cutting several things off the party and move the schedule quicker to accomodate them, leading me to not have the party as I had pictured and having to rush cook, just for some of them to leave right after the food and left only 6 of us behind.

They have done the same in all the other events, show up early, shame me for not being ready, eat and leave.

That leads to yesterday when I was talking to my mom and asked me what was I planning for Christmas this year. I said I wasn't planning anything since I had told them last time I didnt like their attitude and I was done. That lead to a fight about how I can't ""take a joke"" and I should instead ""learn to take help and accomodate to our family"".

The argument lead to nothing but has left me wondering, Am I really the AH here? My husband is on my side but I'd like some unbiased opinions.

Edit: Grammar mistakes

ETA: Some of you have asked about what she meant by not accepting help. Here's a comment I left before  explaining more:

They have offered help before, and I'd let them but never do as I asked. For example, last christmas I was making an apple crumble, they offered help so I asked them to just peel the apples and specifically told them not to cut them since I like them sliced in a very specific way. Also, to only peel the green ones since the red was for a charcuterie table I was assembling. They peeled all of them and cut them into cubes. 

When I got annoyed, they called me dramatic and that it was better their way.

I stopped letting them help because they always thought they knew better, so I instead asked them to sit and have a drink and had snacks prepared in case I got delayed.

47,1fc3ukr,AITA for not visiting my friend anymore because of her serious allergies? ,"I (25F) have a friend (28F) that lives in another state, which is accessible by a few hour train ride. We've been friends for a few years, starting with us meeting online, and when we learned we were close enough to visit we started hanging out IRL. She's great and hanging out with her is usually super fun. However...

She has very serious allergies to very common things that make up most of my diet. Not airborne, but she can't touch anything that has touched her allergen. 

The issue is that because of this, it's hard to find things to eat when I'm there. This is the part where I think I'm the asshole- I have autism and have always been a picky eater and finding stuff I can eat can be challenging for me, so I can't really eat the kind of things that she does that are safe with her allergies. I also get hungry easily and eat a lot, so just munching on snack foods throughout the day like she does isn't exactly an option. So just eating what she does is out.

I also can't make stuff for myself when I'm over there. She has roommates who we aren't close with who own the other pots and pans and I wouldn't feel comfortable asking them if I could use their stuff, and I can't cook on her dishes due to cross contamination. They also share groceries and don't have a ton of space and I would feel weird using their stuff or buying stuff for myself and trying to take it with me afterwards on the train.

Usually when I go visit someone and stay over for a few days, I eat the food they make for part of the time and we order food at restaurants the other part of the time, and the same happens when they come over to mine. Usually, the host pays for food, (but if we go somewhere really expensive we'll split the bill and the tip/delivery fees if it was ordered online), and I do the same for them when they come over to my place. Because of my friend's allergies, she doesn't eat at restaurants, which I understand. The issue is that she doesn't want to pay for my food as the host when I come over to her place if she's not going to eat anything. This is something I do understand of course, I'm not mad at her for it.

...but, I don't really have the budget to stay over at my friend's place for several days and buy all of my meals on doordash (since she obviously doesn't want to go to a restaurant and not eat anything) for everything I eat. I've also tried just eating her food for the weekend and it was very hard for me, I ended up extremely hungry and in a bad mood. We don't live close enough that it's feasible for me to come down for only one day and go back to my place, it's a several hour train ride. I'm not really sure what to do here. I love my friend, but she asked me recently why we hadn't seen each other in a few months and I told her I wasn't sure I could keep seeing her if she wasn't going to host and expected me to find my own meals, and she's been icy with me ever since.

My parents are divorced and my dad is perfectly fine with me hanging out with friends even more than once a week, where as my mom gives me crap for even hanging out once a week (which for her is once every other week) she's tried to make me jealous of what her and my sister do by going out to eat when I'm playing DND, or playing video games with friends. She acts jealous and makes it seem like I don't care about her when I hang out with friends. She's also said stuff like ""I bet you don't do this at your dad's house"". When plans have gotten cancelled she's just been like ""so? I don't care"". I've become new friends with this girl and we were going to hang out for the second time and get boba together and she had to cancel and we cant reschedule for a couple of weeks, and as I got the text from her my mom was making me clean out stuff from our fridge and I was pretty bummed. Ironically my mom has dinner with a friend tonight. I was just sitting and waiting for my mom to finish before I washed the dishes, and my mom was telling me about how I have to mop the floor right after too. So I was pretty bummed that I have to do all these chores instead of hanging out with my cool new friend. I wasn't taking anything out on my mom at first I was just kinda sitting there waiting. I started listening to music when I washed the dishes, and my mom was acting like I was being an asshole.

My parents are divorced and my dad is perfectly fine with me hanging out with friends even more than once a week, where as my mom gives me crap for even hanging out once a week (which for her is once every other week) she's tried to make me jealous of what her and my sister do by going out to eat when I'm playing DND, or playing video games with friends. She acts jealous and makes it seem like I don't care about her when I hang out with friends. She's also said stuff like ""I bet you don't do this at your dad's house"". When plans have gotten cancelled she's just been like ""so? I don't care"". I've become new friends with this girl and we were going to hang out for the second time and get boba together and she had to cancel and we cant reschedule for a couple of weeks, and as I got the text from her my mom was making me clean out stuff from our fridge and I was pretty bummed. Ironically my mom has dinner with a friend tonight. I was just sitting and waiting for my mom to finish before I washed the dishes, and my mom was telling me about how I have to mop the floor right after too. So I was pretty bummed that I have to do all these chores instead of hanging out with my cool new friend. I wasn't taking anything out on my mom at first I was just kinda sitting there waiting.

My boyfriend’s brother (21m) studies in our city and so he stays every other weekend at our house. Last time, during summer break, he asked if he can come with his friends because there were free concerts in our city. I said sure, but they have to clean after themselves. We were not home at the time. 

When we came back, a week after they left we found wet bed linen in the washing machine, garbage was in the garbage can, but with no garbage bag which was so gross after a week of hot weather (seriously, disgusting). He also didn’t put any linens on the couch that he was sleeping which for me is also quite disturbing because he was drinking and then sweating on my bare couch. My other issue is that I felt more uncomfortable with the knowledge that there were strangers in my house than I thought I would be. 

After that, me and my bf decided that he can bring friends overnight only if we are at home. Now he wants to come with his friends for a weekend during our vacation. We said that he can come but his friends or all of them need to find other arrangements.

52,1fc2m8r,AITA for not lending a classmate my powerbank?,"We were on the way home from a school trip, on the bus. It was about an hour long and packed. His phone had died just before the ride and mine had 90%

Background information: We used to be close, but we've grown apart. He probably finds me boring because I like to follow the rules more so than he does. I like to follow the rules and not muck about too much. I am pretty bad at social situations and often reuse the same bit, thus leading to me being annoying.

On the first bus I loaned him the powerbank.

I was frustrated the first day due to getting a pretty bad headache and the chaos, which I partly caused. I will say I was part of starting the chaos half an hour or so earlier. I also loaned it out when he along with another friend wanted to watch a movie, me and some others didn't and wanted to sleep so we waited outside without telling them out of fear of being labled ""boring"". This, along with some other things, created tension—mainly from my side toward him. I tried to hide this but as we will see later I failed.

The next day, he lent me some instant coffee, which I really appreciated.

I do frequently lend him things in school, as he doesn't like to bring his bag around so is often underprepared.

Onto the story: Our trip was coming to its end and we had just taken our seats. I sit alone a couple rows infront of him. *He asks for the powerbank* I say sure and tell him to come and get it, he tells me to throw it, but I refuse due to me not wanting to damage the powerbank or hit somebody. He reaches over the seats and tells me to hand it to him. Later, he claimed the aisle was blocked by people and luggage. From my perspective, it looked like he could have come to get it. **Thus I say no and that I couldn't reach him eitherway**

He quietly gives up; I still have it ready if he wants to come and get it? (I thought he was just going to wait for people to take their seats and come get it when we start driving.

I said I didn't care if he got the powerbank and that he should’ve came. He argued I should've brought it to him since he gave me coffee, but I don't think favors create debt. I also thought that was strange since I usually lend him stuff, along with the powerbank both on the first bus and when he wanted to watch a movie.

The day after they collected the car, the engine seized up and it was scrapped (no refund possible because they bought it from auction), they then went and bought another for £3000.

  
During this time I was having no input because I was recovering from the crash, and while grateful, I was a little pissed off that a £1500 debt became £4500. On top of this, the car they bought is extremely expensive to tax, run and insure.

54,1fc26xm,"AITA for being ""rude"" with the wine I brought to a dinner party?","I (18M) started university this past week and was yesterday I went over to a new classmate's (Aaron 20M) house for dinner. Basically, we are grouped together in class for the semester, and Aaron planned this dinner so we can all get to know each other.

It was a potluck and I was asked to bring wine as my contribution. One of the girls in our group (Breanna 18/19F -not sure age), said that she loves red wine. There were going to be 6 of us at the dinner (5 classmates + Aaron's roommate) so 4 guys and two girls.

It was my first dinner party without family but my mum to help me choose some wine to bring. I ended up bringing two bottles of wine ($20 each). It was more expensive that I had bought before but wanted to bring something good for this group. FYI I am in Canada where it is legal to buy alcohol at 18.

When I got to the dinner, I gave Aaron the wine and he was very complimentary of my choices. But when the dinner started, he didn't put the bottles on the table... instead he had poured both bottles of wine into glass wine containers. I didn't understand why because I usually just pour wine from the bottles.

Well when dinner started, everyone was talking about the food and someone asked me what I brought. Aaron said immediately that I bought the wine, and everyone said it was really good. But I felt like, because they were in the glass containers, nobody could really know how good the wine was without looking at the bottle. So I went to the kitchen and got both of the empty bottles and passed them around the table. I said they were expensive but they were on sale and said the price of each bottle.

This is where the issue started. When the bottles got to Aaron, he stood up to bring them back to the kitchen. But not everyone had seen them yet so I said to keep passing them around because Breanna hadn't seen the bottles yet. I said that because Aaron put the wine in the containers, nobody know how good the wine I brought was, and that he shouldn't have put the wine in the containers without asking me about it first. I felt like it wasn't fair.

Aaron said that all the food was put onto serving plates and nobody knows or cares about the cost of the food items. He said that because I brought such good wine it was proper to put it into a wine container to let it air, and I was an asshole and trying to rub in everyone's face the cost of the wine.

But I wasn't. I only wanted people to know that it was good wine and not cheap wine, and when you put the wine in the containers nobody can tell. I only said the cost of the wine because I wanted to point out that I got it on sale.

Well... things cooled down, but I felt mad that I got called an asshole and left the party after dinner. I chatted with a different friend in the group this morning and he said everyone stayed for a couple more hours and some of them also thought I was being rude and weird about the wine.

I used to work at a friend’s bar. I helped them and they helped me as I was reorganising my life and finding a new path.
Then I got the opportunity to do an internship and it was clear that I would have to leave my friends place. Up to this point everything was okay between us. Then I was asked if I could help out in another place and I wanted to take the opportunity and asked my friend if it would be okay to change the contract and reduce my hours for the remaining time. From this point things started to get strange because my friend was rather not so happy with me asking to change the working contract. I did not quite understood what the problem was because there was only one month left of me working at my friend’s place. I need to confess that I was a little bit pissed when the response was negative because it was important to me working at the other place too and they always complained that the business is bad for them atm and that there’s so little money. 
Also there were some communication problems between us. My friend never really told me my working hours properly. It was more or less the situation that I always had to asked if I should come to work or not. 
One evening I got a message from my friend asking where I was (why not at work). Actually I did not write that time asking if I should come or not. My friend wrote me for the what felt like first time asking me to come. I replied that I did not knew that they needed me and that I was not at home and could not come. Then a fight via messages started where my friend told me that it was not okay from me just not coming. I was then accused of a lot of relatively personal stuff that had absolutely nothing to do with work. It really got me down and I was upset and confused about the whole situation. 
I asked if I should then come the next day and my friend wrote me that they did not need me the next day. 
The next week my friend wrote me that I did not need to continue to work with them. I recommend that we had a talk. 
So we wanted to meet up but my friend cancelled the meeting last minute and so I wrote that I would not continue coming because the situation was so messed up… 
In the end of course, I buried my head in the sand and avoided a proper conversation with my friend( it was extremely unpleasant for me). That was a bad decision and I regret that deeply. 

My friend wrote me again to say that the situation was shit as it was, but I didn’t respond to the message any more and wanted to distance myself from it. I was over it after all the strange accusations. It’s been several months now and I still think often about my friend. Should I have behaved differently? But at the same time, the things my friend accused me of really affected me and I felt unfairly treated.. I wish we could have a conversation, but at the same time I don’t see myself in a position to come forward and chase after my friend.

He was the one who chose to move out and our mum always wanted a positive relationship with him for me and my brother. 

Our mum didn’t like cooking for him, as he would often take a lot of the food or complain, and has been gradually stopping cooking for him, and he hadn’t eaten here since January. Our mum was our only provider, and he never cooked or looked after us when we were kids and he lived here.

In the last weekend our mum was alive, around mid July, our dad started sleeping on our living room couch to take us to the hospital, as neither me nor my brother can drive. Since then, he’s not left our home, where he doesn’t even have a bed. I am currently paying for all of the utilities and food shopping, though shouldn’t have to pay for rent or mortgage when the estate is settled.

We both talked about having children one day when we both had a stable career, but were pretty surpirsed about the news. 
We both continued to work, and I more so to prepare for the up coming baby. I admit that i was more preoccupied with my work, but I thought to take advantage of the early pregnancy news to save up as much money so I can lower my hours later to support her when the pregnancy got tougher.
Around the 9 week mark she unexpectedly had a miscarriage, and it distraughted us both deeply. We both entered a deep depression that lasted several months.
My wife around this time also become very confrontational, accusing me of not being there for her pregnancy, and even accusing me of cheating.
I knew I was innocents, only ever loving my wife and baby; making sure the comments never bothered me.
Around a month ago the constant insults of ""I never cared about the baby"", and the lost of our baby its self led to me to speak to my two closest friends. The are both male btw. It had been about 4 months since our lost and I had yet to talk about it to anyone, even my parents. Though it felt refreshing to finally speak about it, my wife thought other wise, stating that it was her business and her business alone. Though I understand her, the to her I crossed a  boundary she trusted me with, but at the same time, I feel i need to express my sadness.
I feel weird about it since she has spoken about it to her friends and parents. I need soem serious advice, AITA

59,1fc13an,AITA for calling my entire family embarrassing?,"yep, i’m about as popular as rug burn right now.

my family have always partied hard. since i was a small child. this usually involves an insane amount of alcohol (i don’t drink at all, despite being 19 from the UK) and goes on until the early hours of the morning.

my mum’s side of the family smoke weed like it’s going out of fashion and offer it to everyone in sight. they’re also alcoholics who can’t have a party without ending up blacked out, singing at the top of their voices and occasionally fighting with each other.

dad’s side of the family are insanely racist. they also aren’t amazing at controlling themselves.

they’ve been this way since i was a child. my requests for them to have gatherings without alcohol or try not to drink so much would just be laughed off. my mum danced in a fountain while drunk in front of an entire resort once. my grandma skinny dips at every opportunity possible. all of them have burst into my room singing or shouting at least once while i’m trying to sleep.

none of them see a problem with their behaviour. they just say i’m no fun. and maybe i am, but i don’t feel it’s fair for me to have to deal with panic attacks every time they have a party.

well, my mum is having a birthday party which originally i was told would just be a nice sensible bbq so i felt safe bringing my boyfriend to it. turns out it’ll be their normal party but with a bbq. i don’t want him to see the way they act.

my mum brought up yesterday that he’s probably going to be offered weed, and i snapped and called the entire family embarrassing. they are very upset with me because they feel i’m being unfair.

Towards the end of the evening, the opening band for shaggy came out. They sang Dancing Queen, You Make My Dreams Come True, Don’t Stop Believin, etc. Then there was a break… a man comes behind me and goes “hey! hey! hey!” (I couldn't hear him well), I turn around, “there’s people behind you who would like to enjoy the show too”. There was a lot of energy from him I wasn't expecting, so I was confused and kind of mad because there was a group of people standing to our left and far right who were standing and dancing as well. Right in front of us was the fenced in seated section, which the majority were standing and dancing as well. I guess I was on the edge of one group. My mom chimed in and said “well they should stand and enjoy the show” (she’s 5’0 full of attitude and matched his) and the man starts to yell… “NO they don't want to stand!!” once I saw his face turn red I turned around because… wow. 

Now we’re mad. And when I’m mad, I can admit, I get stubborn. So while they get the stage ready for Shaggy, I stood. We didn't have lawn chairs and the blanket we did have, a little girl was wrapped up in like a sleeping bag knocked out. We could’ve sat on the grass, but like I said, now I'm digging my heels in. Once shaggy is about to start, a woman comes behind me. She says “so are you going to stand the whole time?” again with a lot of energy, and I said yes with a straight face- I'm not speaking like I want to fight, I think it was just how they were speaking to me that was getting to my head- she starts saying something else and then my mom pushes in….

the lady leaves, shaggy comes on stage, and he’s getting irritated with the crowd for sitting.. 🫠“This isn't an opera” he kept saying, and was trying to teach the crowd dances and get them involved.

We bought her an iphone 13 pro a couple years ago.

She broke hers just months after getting it thankfully we had applecare and managed to get it repaired. Now she again broke her phone this time after it accidentally fell off her hand at a freinds house while she was playing a video game. The phone is too badly damaged now. She is now begging for an iphone 15

Unfortunately it's no longer covered by insurance meaning we will have to buy a new phone. We just spent a lot of money on a gaming PC and an ipad for her 14th birthday I don't really want to spend more money on electronics and smartphones for her especially. A new iphone would cost A 1000 dollars.


She's also broken it once already and I feel I'll be rewarding this behavior if I buy her another phone as she still seems to be clumsy. I made a deal with her that if she keeps her ipad for a year without breaking it I'll buy her a new phone the next year. She's now complaining that I'm going too far and that I'm ""ruining her life"" and that she needs an iphone. She does still have a smartphone but she complains about it being slow and a bad camara. She's currently using her sisters old redmi note 11 it's working well but it isn't as cool as her iphone.

But im wondering if I should just get her another iphone and if I'm going too far with the punishment.

AITA?

I got a comment about why I didn't get my older daughter an iphone as we both got them phones at around the same time. The reason I got her a lower end phone was she didn't want an iphone.

62,1fc04y4,AITA for disrespecting my mom?,"Apologies for any grammar mistakes. This situation happened almost a month ago, just before the first day of school. I’m 15, F and my mom is 52 F. We agreed that she would take me to get my hair done. Since I’m Black and get protective hairstyles, they are quite pricey. I found a stylist who was affordable and sent her 2 videos on Instagram showing the hairstyle I wanted. On the appointment day, I was excited since my previous stylist canceled, and I had messaged over 50 hairstylists for pricing (not even joking)

When we arrived, the stylist started on my hair. I asked for knotted ends instead of curled ends, and she agreed. when it comes to getting my hair done i do usually have a fear of speaking up if they don’t do something properly, so when she asked me to stand up to check the length, which I appreciated. For knotted ends, the twists need to be folded, making them shorter, but she didn’t inform me of this. During the appointment, i did speak up a few times about parting and length and etc. But after she finished, keep in mind I had asked for butt-length hair, I noticed the length was mid-back. I complimented the stylist’s work but mentioned it wasn’t the length I wanted. She said she misheard me and offered a $10 discount but didn’t offer to fix it. Feeling upset but not confrontational,  I texted my mom “She gave me the wrong length, so she’s taking off $10. Please tell her my hair doesn’t look like the picture for me. I don’t want to be rude, but I’m a bit irritated. Please don’t read out loud.” I also called her to let her know we were done. When my mom walked in, I mouthed and whispered for her to check her phone and she did and read it, but she ignored me, told the stylist it was fine, paid, and we left.

In the car, I was extremely upset because my mom didn’t help me. She said I should’ve spoken up and that I shouldn’t have gone to this stylist, even though the other person canceled and we had already paid a deposit. We argued, and whenever I asked why she didn’t help, she told me to shut up. During the argument, she said, “I should be ashamed of you. Shame on you for not speaking up,” and I replied, “Shame on you for not standing up for me.”

My mom got very angry, said she would never pay for my hair again, and called me disrespectful. She kept telling me to shut up and stop talking, but I insisted on continuing until I was done. She said she didn’t want to address the issue in front of her other clients in the salon but they weren’t even her clients and also said she didn’t know it could be fixed but didn’t ask me if it could be fixed. When we got home, it was a blur. We discussed it, and I told her if she had said anything similar to what I asked, I could’ve addressed the issue then and there.

63,1fc0012,AITA for not being more affectionate with my friend's kid?,"The Situation:

A close friend of my partner had a baby, and we’ve always been close—they’re like family to us. For context, my partner and I don’t have kids.

About Me:

I (30F) can be awkward or reserved when I first meet people. It takes me time to warm up, but once I do, I am friendly and helpful.

Background:

Their young child (around 1 year old) often comes along when they visit. While we don’t mind, I’ve noticed the parents don’t always keep a close eye on the child. For example, the child has occasionally made a mess of our things, and it felt like the parents could have been more attentive. I understand this is typical for young children, but we are very tidy people, and it was frustrating.

At a recent party we hosted, I organized an activity for everyone. The child kept interrupting, and the parents seemed distracted, which affected the vibe. Later, the parents jokingly mentioned that I ""don’t seem to like their kid."" We laughed it off, saying that I’m just awkward with kids, but the remark bothered me. It felt like they were taking my general personality as a personal attack on their child.

Maybe if I had kids in the future, my behavior might change, and I might feel more comfortable being playful with babies.

Recently, the parents made more comments about me not interacting with their child. I felt pressured when they half-jokingly insisted I pick up the child. I refused because it felt controlling (which I’m sure must have offended them even more). Should I have just picked up the child to appease them? They also expressed feeling offended that I don’t engage more with their baby.

Whenever we travel, we always bring something back for the baby—like toys or clothes. I think I show support in other ways, just not through physical displays of affection.

After discussing it with my partner, I was told I was overreacting and that the friends just want me to bond with their child because I am important to them. While I understand that, I feel like there’s an expectation that I must act a certain way.

Ongoing Issue:

Recently, they directly asked me to interact with the child in specific ways (talk to the child, blow air kisses, pick them up, etc.), which I found controlling and out of character for me. Maybe if the child were older, it would be easier for me to engage. Right now, I feel like they scrutinize how I behave around their baby, and it doesn’t make me want to spend time with them at all.

64,1fbzr0i,AITA for telling my obesity-enabling stepmom that she's ruining her son's life?,"I (F22) have a stepmom (F40) and she has an 11-year-old kid with my father. Let's call him Cal. My half-brother Cal is obese - 79 Kgs.

Cal is an extremely picky eater. There are only 4-5 dishes that he eats. One of these is French fries. He eats fries as a meal, not as a side to anything, and the quantity is equivalent of about 2.5 packs of McDonald's large fries. In an average week, he ends up eating fries 6-8 times, with other meals being rice with some sort of gravy or curry, topped with lots of potato chips for the crunch (sounds weird, tastes great). There are literally NO vegetables or fruits in his diet, apart from an occasional apple. He does not eat chicken, eggs, meat, fish or any other type of protein, except for the big tall glass of chocolate milk he has everyday, which is packed with sugar.

My stepmom, who is also obese, has allowed this to go on for 11 years, without ever trying to change his eating habits. I get that she has a lot on her plate (no shade intended), but she has never put an effort to get him to try new and healthy foods. She asks once or twice, but when he begins to throw tantrums, as children do, she budges. I have told her multiple times that she should just let him stay hungry for a few meals if he is so reluctant to try foods that are good for him. She responds by calling me heartless for wanting my brother to ""starve"". Eventually over the years, I began giving her suggestions like air frying his fries instead of deep frying them, but she said that he can always tell when they are air fried and that he rejects them.

Now here's what happened today: My mom left for work as she usually does after lunch at around 1.30 and instructed me to provide Cal with cookies and milk for snacks at around 4pm. Cal eats 6 chocolate chip cookies dipped in chocolate milk everyday for his evening snack. But today, he didn't ask for it. So I did not offer. When stepmom came home at 6, she was PISSED OFF that I ""starved"" him. Cal told her that he did not want them today, to which she said ""Oh so your sister got inside your head?"". I said, ""I am not going to offer an obese child unhealthy processed food unprompted. Cal can't even go play outside because he is physically unable to, and all he does is play video games all day. You are ruining his life like you ruined mine and yours."" She told me I have no right to decide how she raises her child because I don't understand how difficult motherhood is, and started crying loudly. My father, who usually sides with me on matters related to Cal's diet and weight, called me an ungrateful bitch for making her cry after all she does for us.

I think maybe I crossed a line today.

To be clear, as a former fat kid, I am deeply concerned for his lifestyle and wellbeing and don't want him to go through all the things that I did. My stepmom's behavior is clearly enabling him.

She asks once or twice, but when he begins to throw tantrums, as children do, she budges. I have told her multiple times that she should just let him stay hungry for a few meals if he is so reluctant to try foods that are good for him. She responds by calling me heartless for wanting my brother to ""starve"". Eventually over the years, I began giving her suggestions like air frying his fries instead of deep frying them, but she said that he can always tell when they are air fried and that he rejects them.

Now here's what happened today: My mom left for work as she usually does after lunch at around 1.30 and instructed me to provide Cal with cookies and milk for snacks at around 4pm. Cal eats 6 chocolate chip cookies dipped in chocolate milk everyday for his evening snack. But today, he didn't ask for it. So I did not offer. When stepmom came home at 6, she was PISSED OFF that I ""starved"" him. Cal told her that he did not want them today, to which she said ""Oh so your sister got inside your head?"". I said, ""I am not going to offer an obese child unhealthy processed food unprompted. Cal can't even go play outside because he is physically unable to, and all he does is play video games all day. You are ruining his life like you ruined mine and yours."" She told me I have no right to decide how she raises her child because I don't understand how difficult motherhood is, and started crying loudly. My father, who usually sides with me on matters related to Cal's diet and weight, called me an ungrateful bitch for making her cry after all she does for us.

I think maybe I crossed a line today.

To be clear, as a former fat kid, I am deeply concerned for his lifestyle and wellbeing and don't want him to go through all the things that I did. My stepmom's behavior is clearly enabling him. AITA for not participating?",0.0,0.052769184,0,1

Well maybe like I'd said if you'd checked on me you would of known I was in an emergency or if you'd cared enough to check my texts when you knew I was in hospital. So am I the asshole and a guilt tripper for wanting my friend to check on me in an emergency and be there for me for once when he never normally is. Or is he?",1.0,1.0575844,1,1
75,1fbwlfn,AITA for refusing to give my seat to my friend's boyfriend at her birthday dinner?,"So, my friend (26F) recently had a birthday dinner at a restaurant, and she invited a group of us to celebrate. When I (25F) arrived, I found a seat near the middle of the table, right next to the birthday girl. A bit later, her boyfriend showed up and immediately asked if I could switch seats with him so he could sit next to her.

I said no, mostly because I got there early, picked my spot, and honestly, it felt a little awkward to be asked to move. Plus, we were all there to celebrate her, so I figured it wasn’t a big deal. He ended up sitting further down the table and seemed fine, but after the dinner, my friend pulled me aside and said I should’ve just moved because it was her day, and I made it uncomfortable.

I feel like I didn’t do anything wrong, but now I’m wondering if I was being rude. ",Asshole,2024-09-08,"AITA for refusing to give my seat to my friend's boyfriend at her birthday dinner?

76,1fbwc3y,AITA for 'hotboxing' my hotboxing hubby?,"My hubby and I are both trying to quit smoking. We've both tried multiple times with varying levels of success.
This time my hubby bought me two nicotine vapes to aid my quitting, while he already regularly vapes his green, leafy meds, which also help with the nic withdrawal.


He vapes his leafy meds constantly: in the living room, in the car, etc, constantly exposing me to the distinct fumes. Unfortunately, after numerous experiments with leafy green throughout my life, it turns out that I green the hell out on next to nothing. Seems to be genetic as my dad and my brother are the same. After previous green-out experiences I feel quite nauseous from smelling the vaped green.


Still, my husband takes the green as his literal, doctor-prescribed medicine, so I've tolerated my own discomfort and nausea when he vapes up in the same room or while I'm driving. As much as he might try to exhale out a window I'll still regularly be hit with a full blast if the wind isn't right in the room or the car. God help me if the AC is on and blasting the smog right back at me.


Anyway, today I've been vaping in the car and living room as itstday 2 of quitting smokes. This was how we've quit in the past. We were in the living room and suddenly he (with his own green vape in hand) tells me to go outside if I want to vape as I'm exhaling nicotine on him. He'd been vaping his green all over me all afternoon and all throughout the car while I'd been driving this morning.
He knows green makes me queasy and he explicitly bought the vape to help me quit. Vaping nice had never been an issue for him before.


AITA for telling him to bugger off with this double standard?

Edit: additional info
Yes, I've committed the fact that his green vape makes me nauseous. Each time he'll stop using it around me for a short while, then gradually take it up around me again (usually in the car during long trips, then in the house afterwards).

So I (17F) was talking on the phone with a friend of mine about some plans we have for this afternoon and my mom was nearby doing her thing. I was basically telling my friend that we might have to cancel our original plans for today (we were planning to go to the cinema) since my mother most likely wouldn't let me. Yeah i know I'm 17 and I have my own savings but I try my best to avoid conflict since it stresses me a lot. Last time I asked for her permission she straight up declined saying that it's not worth the money. It's been like a year since I went to the cinema, and that was a disaster since I didn't take my twin brother with me (it was like a girls' night and he doesn't get along with some of my friends) so I spent the whole time being worried about her reaction once I returned home. She tends to be super controlling with money, she even keeps track of whatever she buys, writes em down to her notebook and every time she gets a new one she rewrites the old ones. Like we have the prices of clothing we got 5 years ago- she also tends to look into my bags and drawers for receipts and all.. my best friend's birthday is arriving and I was planning to get her a gift, and my mother told me I had to buy something bellow 10 euros but  got her something with about 12 (I'm also planning to make her a drawing too). I told my mom the gift costed 11 (I tend to lie about prices cause she gets so mad, but like it's my own money and I barely get stuff for myself or others). I threw the gift's receipt in the trash, inside something else so she wouldn't find it, but guess what.. she did and came to my room to lecture me about it.

78,1fbvm2w,AITA for holding my parents to a prior agreement? (shopping related),"Hey, would love some outside perspective. 

My parents were on holiday for four weeks and it's a long drive so they usually split it up and stay overnight halfway. In past years they often stayed close to a special pottery and we all have some items from them. I started to buy tableware from them in the past, but couldn't afford a full set yet. Now I'm at the point in life where I can. I asked my parents if they would be open to getting me a few things from there on the way back, and they agreed. So i spent considerable time and effort documenting the pieces, with numbers and colour codes from their catalogue and formatting it really nicely and easily for them. 

yesterday we discussed the list as well as opening times and when they would go, so that i can stay close to my phone in case of questions. 

today, i hear nothing. then text to double check all went okay. It turns out the store was quite  emptied out and they  couldn't get the items so instead bought similar, but different ones for me. I called my dad immediately, hoping they were still before check-out, but it turns out they were just out, to stop the sale. 

Now everyone is upset; me because they didn't communicate, they, because i have 'such high standards it's impossible' and hurtful. 

I'm mostly annoyed that my dad didn't check with me. One text would have sufficed to ask if i was fine with different stuff. for them it's mostly special items, that can be thrown together randomly, for me it's my standard tableware, that should somehow fit together. 

And i am annoyed for basically being asked to grovel by my mom right now, because i hurt my father's feelings. it feels like i'm being forced back into the role of child and wholly unsuitable to the entire situation. 

for context, we're all grownups. we get along just fine 99% of the time. I also traveled to their home to take care of plants while they were  away.

79,1fbvcps,AITAH for havung an arguement with my wife for excluding herself then being upset about it? ,"Background: My wife and I have recently joined a new company together (I joined in Feb and she joined 6 weeks ago) when I joined I struggled to find people to be friends with (I'm quite introverted) until I discovered a work social group who play boardgames together once a month in the evening and I have become friends with them, even though I don't work directly with them.  

Fast forward to this week and I invited my wife (extrovert) to boardgames night for the first time which she wasn't 100% sure about but she decided to join as I invited her and she does actually enjoy playing games. 

We went last night and there were 2 groups (1 and 2) playing different games. We played a few different games with group 1 for about for 3 hours which we both really enjoyed but then our group decided to split and play 2 4 player games (groups 1A and 1B), my wife and I went with 2 others who had wanted to play a specific game all night so we agreed to join in however when setting it up my wife decided it was a bit too complex for her so said she'd sit out and watch and learn how to play. I asked if she was sure and she said yes it's fine, I suggested she checks with group 2 to see if she can join in but she said she was fine waiting this one out. I checked how long the game was and it said approx 1 hour and she still said she was okay watching.

So me and thr other 2 start playing and about 30 mins in to the game my wife walks out the room, I didn't realise as I was quite focused on learning the game but I text her soon after when I realised and asked if she was okay and she said yes she's watching netflix on her phone and she's okay.

I continue playing for another 30 mins but the game doesn't look like it's finishing so say to the other 2 that it's getting late so I'm going to dip out and find my wife.

I go and find her and this is where it kicks off, she's upset that she felt excluded because she didn't want to play that game and I didn't suggest to group 1A that we play something else instead. She feels the decision was out of her hands on what to play because group 1B was already a 4 person game and group 2 were mid game. She didn't feel comfortable saying anything herself as she was new to these people (which surprised me as she is extroverted and that's something even I'd do as an introvert if my only other choice was to sit out, so I didn't pick up on her feeling uncomfortable). 

We had an arguement about this with me saying she needs to be more clear and not just do the typical 'I'm fine, it's fine' even if she just told me and not announced it that she wanted to play something else I would have done more about it. And her being annoyed that I should've picked up on her hints and stepped in as 'she would never let someone sit out and watch'.

I (14f) live with my family which consists of my parents (40's), my paternal grandparents (70's) and my baby sister (9m). We live in a small 2 bedroom apartment and since there are 6 of us it's kind of hectic. My grandparents sleep in the living room on a foldable couch, my parents sleep in the master bedroom with my sister and I sleep in the smallest room in the house. The room wasnt originally small but since the kitchen is not big enough I have some appliance like the fridge and microwave in my room, plus two closets, my own and my grandparents with a twin sized bed.

Now to the situation, as I mentioned above my house is pretty full and it sometimes causes problems, my uncle and aunt who live about 3 hours away like to come and stay here when they visit. Its just that our other relatives live close to each other and they are kind of the only ones who live so far but the thing is they also have a son (20's) who is autistic. Someone has to take care of him 24/7, and whenever they are over they atleast stay a night or sometime even weeks.

It becomes difficult to have any privacy and I try to stay in my room most the time but someone is always there. It really effects with my schedule. And whenever I say anything, everyone says its because they're family and its only two days...... There have been multiple arguments about this and one of the main reason is that I don't like having anyone sleep in my bed, the only person I'll share with is my mom.

Currently they are staying here again and I've been kicked out my room because my cousins needs to sleep, and I'm wondering would I be the ahole if I say something???

82,1fbu62e,AITA for not giving my bestfriend as much attention as she ‘needs’? ,"Me(F21) and my best friend(F21) have been friends for 7 years, almost 8. We always had the issue of jealousy.

She started to open up in a round about way, throwing comments like “if you like them more than me just say that” or sarcastic saying: “it’s not like we haven’t talked in like forever”

When she isn’t busy, we play together video games at night or call even text here nd there. When she’s free I still want to play with my other friends sometimes so I tell her I can’t play, She gets down and insecure, she feels like I’m pulling away or that she’s an inconvenience to me “I’m sorry I’m an inconvenience.” “Everyone makes me feel like an inconvenience”. 

What should I do? Am I in the wrong for not giving her enough attention and hanging out with my other friends more? Despite when we do talk, I treat her like a bestfriend and value the time we do have fun.

I just feel like these are highschool problems, that as 21 year olds, this shouldn’t be an issue. It feels like her insecurities are being put onto me and she needs constant reassurance and to talk 24/7. I spoke to her, and on my mistake, I tend to sugar coat things and dance around her feelings when we talk about it, telling her I care and that I’m sorry for making her feel that way.

Despite have that conversation three times; me apologizing for being a ‘bad friend’ and trying to give her a bit more attention, she still throws those guilt-trip comments. 

I see her point of view, she’s going through hard times (It feels like ever since we met there is always tough times and that she relies on me for happiness and comfort) and doesn’t have other friends so it’s only natural to want to talk to your bestfriend a lot.

My point of view is that I don’t need to talk to someone 24/7 to feel like we are close. I feel like she is treating this friendship like a relationship and is reliant on me for her happiness. I have multiple friends and like to hangout with them all for different things. 

I value communication and coming to conclusions but this is a reoccurring problem that i don’t give her enough attention and she doesn’t speak up, only acts sulky and talks in mumbles. 

She’s a great friend despite all that and gives our friendship her all. Very affectionate girl and loves with her whole heart. We have fun 90% of the time and I value our friendship, I don’t want to have to end our friendship because of this. 

I am just wondering if one of us is in the wrong or right, or if there even is one. What are outsiders opinions on the matter? I don’t want biased opinions, I want the realistic and hard truth, I am open to any input to help my decision.

Of course it’s disappointing and I still care for her but this is for the best and it feels like a huge burden off my shoulders. :)",Not the A-hole,2024-09-08,"AITA for not giving my bestfriend as much attention as she ‘needs’?  Me(F21) and my best friend(F21) have been friends for 7 years, almost 8. We always had the issue of jealousy.

She started to open up in a round about way, throwing comments like “if you like them more than me just say that” or sarcastic saying: “it’s not like we haven’t talked in like forever”

When she isn’t busy, we play together video games at night or call even text here nd there. When she’s free I still want to play with my other friends sometimes so I tell her I can’t play, She gets down and insecure, she feels like I’m pulling away or that she’s an inconvenience to me “I’m sorry I’m an inconvenience.” “Everyone makes me feel like an inconvenience”. 

What should I do? Am I in the wrong for not giving her enough attention and hanging out with my other friends more? Despite when we do talk, I treat her like a bestfriend and value the time we do have fun.

I just feel like these are highschool problems, that as 21 year olds, this shouldn’t be an issue. It feels like her insecurities are being put onto me and she needs constant reassurance and to talk 24/7. I spoke to her, and on my mistake, I tend to sugar coat things and dance around her feelings when we talk about it, telling her I care and that I’m sorry for making her feel that way.

Despite have that conversation three times; me apologizing for being a ‘bad friend’ and trying to give her a bit more attention, she still throws those guilt-trip comments. 

I see her point of view, she’s going through hard times (It feels like ever since we met there is always tough times and that she relies on me for happiness and comfort) and doesn’t have other friends so it’s only natural to want to talk to your bestfriend a lot.

My point of view is that I don’t need to talk to someone 24/7 to feel like we are close. I feel like she is treating this friendship like a relationship and is reliant on me for her happiness. I have multiple friends and like to hangout with them all for different things. 

I value communication and coming to conclusions but this is a reoccurring problem that i don’t give her enough attention and she doesn’t speak up, only acts sulky and talks in mumbles. 

She’s a great friend despite all that and gives our friendship her all. Very affectionate girl and loves with her whole heart. We have fun 90% of the time and I value our friendship, I don’t want to have to end our friendship because of this. 

I am just wondering if one of us is in the wrong or right, or if there even is one. What are outsiders opinions on the matter? I don’t want biased opinions, I want the realistic and hard truth, I am open to any input to help my decision.

I asked why and she said she's agreed to see friends on the Saturdays of the last remaining weekends. I asked why she did that when she knew we had plans. She just said it's fine to move it to November but I pointed out why we couldn't do that. 

She said I'll just need to give up a weekend of revision but I told her she shouldn't be making plans with her friends when we already have them. I said it's clear what her priorities are and it's not our relationship.

I had just gotten out of a toxic relationship and was feeling really down about relationships, and life in general. The last thing on my agenda was jumping into another relationship, but then I met her. Lets call her Katie. I am described as a melancholic reserved introvert who usually keeps to himself. Katie on the other hand is the exact opposite. She is warm, bubbly, cute, and can effortlessly become friends with anyone. Despite our differences, somehow we had instant chemistry. I found her so easy to talk to and I felt like I could be my true self with her like nobody I have ever met. And the fact that someone who is so likeable and socially skilled craves my attention has drastically improved my confidents and has made me feel more comfortable coming out of my shell with other people. I really do love her and cant imagine life without her at this point.



But since she moved into my apartment 2 months ago we have been having some problems. She craves much more social stimulation than me. And it doesn't help that she hasn't found a job yet since graduating from college. Between work, and training for a triathlon (exercise is very important for my mental health), I am often exhausted when I get home. And when I'm tired I have low social energy. But Katie is usually eager to chat and banter as soon as I get through the door, sometimes I just don't have the energy to satisfy her.



The other day was exactly how I described. After a long day at work followed by a long run, I came home exhausted. We were sitting on the couch watching TV and she was trying to joke around, and ask me about my day but I just didn't have it in me to match her energy. I just wanted to watch the show and turn my brain off. And so like she often does if I'm not giving her enough of my attention, she started lightly tickling my feet. My feet are extremely ticklish and I can't help but react. I told her to stop twice and she ignored me, then I lost my temper and I yelled at her. I had never yelled or even raised my voice at her before. She stormed off the couch with tears in her eyes, slammed the bedroom door closed and went to bed. I slept on the couch, and we haven't spoke since. I hate the fact that I raised my voice at her, but she was really pushing me and I have my limits. I don't really know where to go from here.

He hates questions so much, but only sometimes. One questions is a cop question, but the next day, same question is fine and answered immediately.

I’ve told him I literally can’t think of almost anything that he could b doing that I either don’t already kno or wouldn’t b supportive of. He says “it’s j the principle” but I feel like that’s crap.

90,1fbrv7v,AITA for not moving my wedding date to accommodate my sister's pregnancy?,"I (25F) have a sister, Ella (28F)

Ella and I have always been close growing up, despite her being 3 years older. We've always been best friends, I was her MOH and she's mine.

Ella is currently 5 months pregnant. She had a rough first trimester, throwing up 3-4 times a day, always tired. Some days, she couldn't get out of bed, literally. She had also found out early when she was a month into it because her symptoms were so bad.

Her and I live close to each other, and since her husband travels a lot for work, I have stayed with her a lot since I work remotely. 

My fiancé and I had originally set the date for July. However, seeing how sick she was, I, along with my entire family, were getting worried, and so after my fiancé and I discussed it, we decided to reschedule the wedding until after she had passed  her first trimester (per her doctor, she was supposed to get better.)

I need to add that no one asked this of us, but I felt it was needed. 

And thank god, she did get better. She's eating normally, going out and back to herself.

Seeing this, my fiancé and I talked about our wedding again. I had always wanted a summer wedding on the beach, but I didn't want to wait a full year, and seeing winter wedding pictures was slowly growing on me. And so, we decided on a December wedding. 

The invitations were finalized last week with the date and were all sent a couple of days ago (yes, it's early but my man and I all have big families/big group of friends and colleagues, we need the RSVPS early) Yesterday, I got an angry phone call from my sister asking how can I do something like this to her.

I was honestly confused and told her as much, and she went on to rant about how inconsiderate I was to not wait until my nephew is born, that her being MOH and 8 months pregnant is going to be hard and that she has already been through hell.

I calmly explained to her that while yes, she is MOH, I don't expect her to go above and beyond. My best friend and her had already planned a girls night back when my wedding was in July, so we're just going with that again (everything is already bought and my best friend will set it up) 

I told her that my man and I have also re-booked everything ourselves (flowers, venue and catering are going to be done by our friends who have their own shops and companies) and that I'll pay to have her dress resized to accommodate her bump. I'm even taking care of hair and makeup for all my wedding party, a sort of pamper session where we'll all get ready together and take pictures. 

All she's required to do is show up. 

She's having none of it and is demanding we reschedule it again until next summer. I put my foot down and gave her a flat out no.

My parents called me and asked me to reconsider, sayint that I know she's emotional and hormonal, I told them that's not an excuse for her to act like a bitch.

Any opinions/advice are much appreciated.

Edit: First of all, thank you for all the comments and advice,  I'm definitely seeing her side more than I was before.
I do need to clarify some things that I didn't add in the post.
When we rescheduled the wedding, her and BIL had my fiancé and I over for dinner (we do weekly dinners every Friday) she thanked me for rescheduling and told me she felt guilty. I made sure to tell her that I don't blame her, that having her there healthy and happy is what matters, in whatever capacity she can give me. I made sure she knew that she could step down from MOH at any point, even if it was a day before the wedding, and that I would understand. That dinner, my man and I also floated the idea of a winter wedding around, and both her and her BIL said it would be fun since we haven't had that in our family yet.
We also chose the date around many of our families' schedules along with our friends' availabilities who were also being gracious enough to still do our wedding flowers/catering and renting us the venue despite us rescheduling it once already. We didn't decide anything lightly. 
Also, I might update (if I ever figure out how) because my parents called and invited me to their house so my sister and I can talk it out. I have no idea why she's using a third party, even if it's our parents.

[FeistyExternal2244](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/JEHpMNwcCq)",Not the A-hole,2024-09-08,"AITA for not moving my wedding date to accommodate my sister's pregnancy? I (25F) have a sister, Ella (28F)

Ella and I have always been close growing up, despite her being 3 years older. We've always been best friends, I was her MOH and she's mine.

Ella is currently 5 months pregnant. She had a rough first trimester, throwing up 3-4 times a day, always tired. Some days, she couldn't get out of bed, literally. She had also found out early when she was a month into it because her symptoms were so bad.

Her and I live close to each other, and since her husband travels a lot for work, I have stayed with her a lot since I work remotely. 

My fiancé and I had originally set the date for July. However, seeing how sick she was, I, along with my entire family, were getting worried, and so after my fiancé and I discussed it, we decided to reschedule the wedding until after she had passed  her first trimester (per her doctor, she was supposed to get better.)

I need to add that no one asked this of us, but I felt it was needed. 

And thank god, she did get better. She's eating normally, going out and back to herself.

Seeing this, my fiancé and I talked about our wedding again. I had always wanted a summer wedding on the beach, but I didn't want to wait a full year, and seeing winter wedding pictures was slowly growing on me. And so, we decided on a December wedding. 

The invitations were finalized last week with the date and were all sent a couple of days ago (yes, it's early but my man and I all have big families/big group of friends and colleagues, we need the RSVPS early) Yesterday, I got an angry phone call from my sister asking how can I do something like this to her.

I was honestly confused and told her as much, and she went on to rant about how inconsiderate I was to not wait until my nephew is born, that her being MOH and 8 months pregnant is going to be hard and that she has already been through hell.

I calmly explained to her that while yes, she is MOH, I don't expect her to go above and beyond. My best friend and her had already planned a girls night back when my wedding was in July, so we're just going with that again (everything is already bought and my best friend will set it up) 

I told her that my man and I have also re-booked everything ourselves (flowers, venue and catering are going to be done by our friends who have their own shops and companies) and that I'll pay to have her dress resized to accommodate her bump. I'm even taking care of hair and makeup for all my wedding party, a sort of pamper session where we'll all get ready together and take pictures. 

All she's required to do is show up. 

She's having none of it and is demanding we reschedule it again until next summer. I put my foot down and gave her a flat out no.

My parents called me and asked me to reconsider, sayint that I know she's emotional and hormonal, I told them that's not an excuse for her to act like a bitch.

Any opinions/advice are much appreciated.

91,1fbruwo,AITA for not giving my bf a second chance? ,"C (24M) and I (24F) have been together for 5 months. While we were more casual, C was telling me about his friends and how he had met them. One of them was M (24F) who he had hooked up with 2 years ago.  I didn't like it but said nothing.

Later into dating, he introduces me to his friend group, which consisted of M and 3 other people. M ignored me most of the time when I was there. The whole time I found her too be too close with C: she shared towels and sunscreen and water and fed him her ice cream (we had all gone to the beach) When she wasn't sunbathing, she was standing by the water taking photos and videos of C as he swam and was telling him how to pose and etc and telling him he looked good. C also ignored me most of that trip and treated M more like a gf than me. 

On the drive home, we argued about it. He told me I was too conservative because of my culture, that he and M werent that close, and that I was making things up and that it's normal to be friends with someone you have history with. 

About a week later, I am spending the weekend at his house and M facetimes him to complain about a date she had been on (in front of me) and to talk about her sex life and how bad her love life is (she is single now for the first time in 2 years.) They both ignore me during the call.

Over the long weekend, I try to make plans with C. I had work that Monday so I could only meet with him on Sunday. He tells me he's unsure because he may have plans with friends. I ask if he could he reschedule it to Monday so I could see him Sunday? Near the end of the phone call, he lets it slip that he can't see me because M works on Monday so he has to see her on Sunday instead of me. I say nothing but I freak out overnight and block him.

The next day while he's out (with M), he manages to contact me and I send him why I'm upset. He calls me when he gets home and for a few days we argue via text and call. Eventually he agrees to stop talking to M one on one + only see her in group settings.

But I realise I didn't want him to be in contact with her at all and that I did not like that he was going on a trip with her. Meaning they be together on the other side of the world and that my anxiety would become overwhelming and he wouldn't be there to reassure me. I'd be alone for three months while they traveled together. So I break up with him.

I MIGHT be the asshole bc he's had friends block him in the past out of nowhere without explanation and I agree it was thoughtless on my part. But I was overwhelmed and angry and knew that if I had to speak to him that day, I'd say some very regretful things. I believe I am setting boundaries over what I will and won't tolerate in a relationship, but I've had multiple guys cheat on me with women they swore were ""just a friend"" and it's made me very paranoid.

92,1fbrut6,AITA Super long time bathroom use,"I have a friend staying with me for a few weeks. I'm not charging him for rent, utilities, groceries, etc. since he's struggling financially.

The main issue I have is with his bathroom usage even though we have our own bathrooms. He just spent about 100 minutes in the bathroom, from 1am to 2:40am, most of which is on the toilet. During that time, he flushed 10 times. (I counted because I was trying to sleep and waiting for the bathroom vent to be turned off since it's next to my bedroom.)

So I finally texted him after 90min asking wtf is going on and why waste water like that even if water is cheap. He texted me back asking if I like to smell my own shit and that he has ulcerative colitis. 

I don't know much about this disease. Although i still think flushing 10 times in one session is ridiculous, I also feel like an AH for basically policing someone's bathroom use.

93,1fbrnfr,AITA for standing up for myself,"Hi. I am a 34 (f). I have a 38 year old brother who deals with mental health issues.

 He has had a hard life, been in and out of jail and struggled. I have tried to support him as much as I can both financially and emotionally, but lately I haven't been able to as I am at my limit.

I also currently caretake for my mother who has schizophrenia and 2 younger siblings who are autistic, manage everything and make sure physicals, services, etc are always good.

I have had a really hard time mentally, but trying to do better to heal so I can be the best for everyone. I also work full time and have my own family with two young kiddos who are also on the spectrum.

Back to the story:

A few years ago, we updated my car and sold him my older one, which he never completely paid off. He only had the car for about a year until he crashed it. I have my suspicions that alcohol may have been involved, but he has denied everything. 

Aside from that he has constantly asked me for help on rent and even has asked to move into my mom's, but I have refused, because he gets impatient and upset due to some of the statements my mother makes due to her schizophrenia and does not have the patience.

I pay his phone bill because originally I figured it would be a cheaper option for him and he could just pay me, which he never did.  I got so tired of asking, I just stopped asking.

I know he is drowning in debt and I have tried to support, but sometimes I feel like I am in a weird abusive relationship..

My older brother recently has been in emotional distress and has been seeking help from me. But I am unable to support him as my own mental health has been bad. The big issue is he will at times gaslight me, if I am not able to come and help him. He will message me things about how he is alone and he doesn't have anyone. I feel bad because I get it and I want to support him, but he is extremely triggering.

The irony of it is my dad is/was the same way and I just escaped that a few years ago. I don't have a relationship with my father, because after I moved my mother and younger siblings to get away from my dad, I was pretty much dead to him. My dad and me have had a pretty complicated relationship because I never tried to conform to whatever he had to say completely, it took me years to stand up to him completely  and realize he was an alcoholic and a gambling toxic individual who I discovered was  financially abusing my younger siblings disability benefits to buy horses and gamble.

I have spent a lot of my life people pleasing and doing what I can for everyone in my immediate family, but right now I can't do it mentally. It has gotten to the point where I am having panic attacks and have been in the hospital for chest pains. 

Between my own depression and anxiety I am hanging on by threads.

I will post my last text bubble convo between my older brother and myself. I love my brother, but he isn't able to take accountability about how hurtful he can be.

95,1fbrm9t,AITA for inviting my sister’s ex to my birthday dinner?,"(All fake names)

So I(17M) turn 18 in about a month, and I’m going to have dinner at my grandparents house with my family and close friends. The issue is that I invited 3 close friends, one being my best friend, Will(17M), and two of them being my sister’s ex, Jamie(21F), and her new gf, Grace(21F).

So my sister, Sarah(21F), met Jamie in high school. They started dating and Jamie was at our house a lot, and we bonded over video games. Jamie told me about a music program, which I joined 2 years ago and Jamie is still part of the program as an alumni so I see her pretty often. Jamie and Sarah broke up right around the same time I first joined the program though, and even though there were bad feelings between them, Sarah didn’t want Jamie and I to stop being friends. 

Jamie and I ended up bonding over the program, and she, her new gf Grace, Will, and I all became friends and we hang out a lot in our free time. I’ve become really close with them and the three of them and Sarah are all very important people in my life.

The past two years, I’ve celebrated my birthday with my friends and family separately bc of Sarah and Jamie. However this year, since it’s my 18th, I want to celebrate all together, even though I know they’re not on good terms. I brought this up to Jamie and Grace and they agreed because it’s for me, my family still likes them, and they said they would be respectful towards everyone, including Sarah. I told Sarah I invited Jamie, but unfortunately she still has a lot of bad feelings towards Jamie and said she’d prefer it if Jamie wasn’t there, especially because Sarah’s new gf, Elle(19F) will be there too. Sarah and I are close, so it’s important to me that she’s at the dinner. I tried convincing her, asking her to agree to it for me, especially cause it’s my 18th, and it would only be for maybe an hour and a half, but Sarah still disagreed, saying it would be too awkward, and said that if Jamie and Grace were there, then Elle wouldn’t comfortable with it and wouldn’t be there. We went back and forth about it for a while, but Sarah agreed to take time to think about it.

On one hand, I think I may be TAH because Sarah has always been really supportive of me and I know she still has negative feelings towards Jamie, which is completely understandable, and the two couples near each other could make the dinner awkward. On the other hand, I’m not sure I’m TAH because this is something really important to me, and the dinner wouldn’t be long, so they wouldn’t have to talk to each other. I’ve also accommodated for Sarah the past two years, making sure that I keep anything involving Jamie separate from her. So AITA?

96,1fbrfqv,AITA For ending a nearly 13 year friendship?,"Hi. I am kinda at my wits end and I've resorted to coming onto here because people who know me irl are very-very split on the entire situation that has happened and I need a view from people who don't know me or this friend. A little warning as you know from the title, this is nearly 13 years worth of stuff that has built up my memory on somethings isn't that good but I do remember the important things. Also names are fake but ages/genders are real.  I, OP/Nyx(F18) recently broke off a 13 year friendship with one of my best friends(FTM18). For the sake of this post I will call him Light. Also his transition is important to this story so keep that in mind whilst reading. 

I've known Light since we were in kindergarten. We were in the same class, we sat at the same table, we were on the same bus, and most importantly he lived right around the block. But as soon as 6th grade and puberty hit we became super close. We talked everyday, went to the park, and had a super deep connection. It was that year Light also came out to me as a lesbian. I grew up with a mom who was put on a lot of drugs for her mental conditions so I had no idea what a lesbian was at the time but I remained supportive and even learned. It was also that year me and him had our first “argument”, I didn’t have a phone until the end of 7th grade so I had no way to invite him to the park when I went with our other friends. I usually relied on our friends Liza(3 years our senior) and Sam(2 years our senior) to invite him. I guess the past few times we had gone they didn't send an invite because on that summer afternoon he stormed into the park and said to me “You hate me. I know you hate me. Tell me you hate me” so I, who has never been good with tone, responded “I hate you?” He proceeded to storm off while wailing, our other friends laughed and one even ruffled my hair and hugged me. 

The summer before 7th grade we made up. me and him met up at the park and I told him that I was bisexual and asexual. This was the first instance where he completely flipped his lid at me and kept telling me I was wrong, I, who at the time was an over emotional 12 year old, went home and cried. The next day on the bus he acted like nothing was wrong. He also kept bringing up how I couldn't be trans because I didn't wanna do something.

It was 3 months later while we were sitting on the swings that he once again yelled at me. I had brought up ""ABO"" dynamics **\[If you don't know what this is just look it up or don't its a lot\]** and the minecraft youtuber Aphmau. I was saying how it would be so fun to make OC's for her series and how much I enjoyed it. He yelled and called me stupid. Our older friend, who was about to join us in the park, heard his yelling and my crying and jumped to defend me. She told him to ""Stop acting like a bitch and leave Nyx alone."" After the he left. At school months later I had to reconcile our relationship by apologizing and I was forced to apologize during a game of truth or dare which everyone made us play. 

8th grade was fine but we were a little distant. Then covid hit and everyone kinda shut off from one and other. 

It was about mid-2021 when my friend Sappho introduced us to each other once more. I was ecstatic because we were actually good friends again. I thought our petty arguments were over and we would be fine. 

He came out as trans that year as well. He was just going by a shortened version of his birth name as it sounded more masc and he told me that “I lean more towards gay” so I just nodded my head because if I’m being honest I didn’t care. I mean I was happy he came out and I now knew the correct pronouns and such but this was just something I really didn’t care about. It never changed my friendship or opinion on him or anyone else. 

In 2022 we began writing a series about vampires. At first I really liked it but I felt kinda left out at times due to the fact that he and Sappho made their characters romantic interests for each other whilst mine was left to be their “child” and was always infantilized by them. I tried to ignore that and ended up making like 23 characters to cope. Everything was fine until Light decided to completely begin revamping stuff for his characters leaving me to catch up, I was angry but I said nothing as I at the time I felt like this series completely belonged to him, I didn’t feel like I had the ability or even right to say “but wait I don’t like that” From then on the series was mostly controlled by him. Everything I wrote that I shared with him that was canon to the series he rewrote. He didn’t just fix grammar, spelling, and all that stuff. He. Rewrote. Everything.

Then if it was like on our google doc he would make it like size 2 and everything else was size nine. Now that all can be considered petty arguments. And I will even admit that I am just nit picking at that point but my real issue started in near April of this year. I graduated this year (class 2024) and I wanted to bring Light to my prom. So I asked him “Hey wanna come over and then go shopping at the mall?” He said yes and we were happily off to the mall. Now we were shopping for prom items. I had given him that slip to allow him to get entry into prom. I had repeated the date of my prom multiple times. He decided that 3 days before prom he was going to tell me that he never turned the slip in. That he doesn’t have anything for prom. And that most importantly he just doesn't wanna go cause he’s feeling a little depressed.

I say “Okay fine. I know its hard” but I’m panicking cause “Oh shit I have 2 prom tickets and no way to refund them”. Luckily my brother is a saint and volunteered to be my escort for the night so me and my friends could have a good time and he could see his friends and have free food. I still went to Lights prom after this and had a good time. I told him that after I graduate we should be able to hang out freely again. After graduation I fall into a depressive spiral and stop talking to everyone except my friend who we shall call Jesse. Me and Jesse grow super close and they basically become my escape from everything. Through Jesse I make a bunch of other friends who I spend a lot of time with because not only do we share the same interests but around them I don’t feel like I’m in a wave pool with my emotions. I feel more like I’m on a lazy river if that makes any sense. 

When me and light do begin talking again which is only because I found out that he unfriended me on literally everything except one thing and that's crazy to me cause how are you gonna do that? Anyways I digress, I invite him to come over the day after my birthday to hang out and subsequently spend the night. He tells me during this sleepover that while we are jokingly doing that stupid alpha wolf stuff in a gc with Sappho that he legitimately hates Jesses guts. Other than that it goes well until something happens and he goes quiet. He puts in both his head phones and blasts music and anime. By the way I already had music he liked on cause he doesn’t listen to the music I like at all he's more into rock/alt stuff and I’m a girly teen girl who likes Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan, ect you get the jist and anytime he's over I don’t play them cause he’ll always end up just telling me how much he hates them. Again digressing from that, I ended up playing roblox with Jesse and our friends cause he isn’t paying attention to me at all. I wasn’t in vc and I was only typing in chat when I had too. Also I was literally cuddled into his side, like I was pressed against him. So he could have gotten my attention if he wanted too and he never did. I ended up putting my laptop away and saying “I’m gonna sleep now” cause it was like 5am. I fell asleep still cuddled up to him. 

We wake up at like 4pm the next day. I get out of bed, go pee and get something to drink cause Light is still asleep. As I am sipping my powerade I hear my mother attempting to not sob in the living room so I go to check on her. She's on the phone and everyone besides my little sister and brother are in the living room looking teary and devastated. She tells me that an uncle through marriage had passed away. Now me and this uncle weren’t super duper close but he was a man who almost made it his mission to be the happiest and nicest guy in the room. He always had something to say. You always got a good piece of wisdom from him or you got a smartass quip about chili being a soup or aliens existing. He was a really, really good man and nearly every person who met him agreed on that. So I was devastated to know that not only had I lost family, we had also lost a genuinely good person on earth. I admittedly cried into my moms arms like a baby and by the time I had pulled myself together to go back into my room Light had woken up. 

I walk into this room with a bottle of powerade and a teary and snotty face. He looks me dead in the eyes and just says “I’ll go home now” very monotone. 

okay then... 

So I get my uncle to drive him home, I come with because I want to and he doesn’t talk to me at all on the ride home. He doesn’t even say bye as he gets out. He then sends me a message as he walks in his house about how me playing roblox with Jesse (not mentioning the other friends by name just as “others”) was disrespectful and rude and he felt like he wasn’t enough. Which at that moment I could not deal with so I gave him multiple weeks of radio silence whilst I grieved until he sent me one last text telling me that he could not continue in a friendship where he is disrespected and treated so horribly. That I could text him to “re-try”

I in a massive fit of anger and pure sadness sent a 25 minute long voice memo airing out my grievances and issues, our friend Sappho listened to it as well since I sent it to a GC and she sent me several paragraph just telling me why im the worse for basically just showing my emotions. 

For those curious about the voice message it is just me speaking. I say anything and everything including things such as telling light “Fuck you” calling him a petty bitch for unfriending me and not talking to me. I said things they had said previously and then Sappho attacked me for using them. Its a lot.

But in all I ended that friendship with Light after nearly 13 years. So AITA?

Jesse(M18)",TL;DR,2024-09-08,"AITA For ending a nearly 13 year friendship? Hi. I am kinda at my wits end and I've resorted to coming onto here because people who know me irl are very-very split on the entire situation that has happened and I need a view from people who don't know me or this friend. A little warning as you know from the title, this is nearly 13 years worth of stuff that has built up my memory on somethings isn't that good but I do remember the important things. Also names are fake but ages/genders are real.  I, OP/Nyx(F18) recently broke off a 13 year friendship with one of my best friends(FTM18). For the sake of this post I will call him Light. Also his transition is important to this story so keep that in mind whilst reading. 

I've known Light since we were in kindergarten. We were in the same class, we sat at the same table, we were on the same bus, and most importantly he lived right around the block. But as soon as 6th grade and puberty hit we became super close. We talked everyday, went to the park, and had a super deep connection. It was that year Light also came out to me as a lesbian. I grew up with a mom who was put on a lot of drugs for her mental conditions so I had no idea what a lesbian was at the time but I remained supportive and even learned. It was also that year me and him had our first “argument”, I didn’t have a phone until the end of 7th grade so I had no way to invite him to the park when I went with our other friends. I usually relied on our friends Liza(3 years our senior) and Sam(2 years our senior) to invite him. I guess the past few times we had gone they didn't send an invite because on that summer afternoon he stormed into the park and said to me “You hate me. I know you hate me. Tell me you hate me” so I, who has never been good with tone, responded “I hate you?” He proceeded to storm off while wailing, our other friends laughed and one even ruffled my hair and hugged me. 

The summer before 7th grade we made up. me and him met up at the park and I told him that I was bisexual and asexual. This was the first instance where he completely flipped his lid at me and kept telling me I was wrong, I, who at the time was an over emotional 12 year old, went home and cried. The next day on the bus he acted like nothing was wrong. He also kept bringing up how I couldn't be trans because I didn't wanna do something.

It was 3 months later while we were sitting on the swings that he once again yelled at me. I had brought up ""ABO"" dynamics **\[If you don't know what this is just look it up or don't its a lot\]** and the minecraft youtuber Aphmau. I was saying how it would be so fun to make OC's for her series and how much I enjoyed it. He yelled and called me stupid. Our older friend, who was about to join us in the park, heard his yelling and my crying and jumped to defend me. She told him to ""Stop acting like a bitch and leave Nyx alone."" After the he left. At school months later I had to reconcile our relationship by apologizing and I was forced to apologize during a game of truth or dare which everyone made us play. 

8th grade was fine but we were a little distant. Then covid hit and everyone kinda shut off from one and other. 

It was about mid-2021 when my friend Sappho introduced us to each other once more. I was ecstatic because we were actually good friends again. I thought our petty arguments were over and we would be fine.

97,1fbr97n,AITA for wanting my bf to throw this away?,"My ex and I had been together for a year. When we first started dating he came over to my place for the first time and told me to throw away this bear made out of flowers. He said he didn't like the fact that someone else got it for me, even though it was before we got together. I was hesitant about throwing it away but, out of respect, I threw it away. He asked me to throw away other items from my ex's, and i did.

Fast forward -I realized that he had a tattoo on his hand that was a picture of his ex girlfriend. He's a photographer, a great one, and told me that he got the tattoo bc it was the first photo of his that he got a large amount of money for & that it didn't have any emotional ties to it.

Throughout the year I asked him to throw away old items of his ex gfs, the same ex that he has tattoo'd on him, because it made me feel uncomfortable. He also had various items from different women that he dated and I asked him if he could throw them away. He made the effort to throw away some things, but not all. The issue became bigger bc after a few months of us dating, he asked me to move in. I told him that I would but that I would need him to get rid of the items from all the women he dated. I swear I felt like he kept those things as souvenirs.

Fast forward some more - i noticed that he had a lot of pictures of his ex hanging up around his house. He said they were just pieces of his photography work but he did take 3 of the pics down that were in his living room. I wasn't jealous & I truly didn't think he had any feelings for her. I respected the fact that he was a photographer and valued his work.

Toward the end of our relationship, I was looking at this huge picture on his bedroom wall of a woman. It was just her back, not her face. But as I stared at it, I realized it was yet again his ex. I brought it to his attention and he took it down. The next day, I realized that all he did was take down the picture, but the picture was still in his bedroom, sitting on the floor in the direction of the bed..... So if i was to lay down, I'd be looking directly at the picture. I addressed it again, i told him i respect his work and don't want it thrown away, but would like for it to be placed somewhere I wouldn't have to see it. He got mad, picked up the picture,& walked out the house to throw it into the trash shoot.

months later he surprised me by covering up the tattoo of his ex gf. I never asked him to do that, although I'm sure he did it bc I mentioned it made me uncomfortable, but that was at the beginning of our relationship. I felt kinda guilty but I was happy.

About 2 or 3 months after that, he broke up with me and told me he wasn't happy. A few weeks after our breakup I realized that he went to re-follow his ex gf.

98,1fbr510,AITA for asking my wife to stop posting frequent selfies? ,"Together 6 years, my first relationship that lasted longer than a year. She is the most sincere supportive partner I've ever had. she is my favorite person and I find her to be incredibly beautiful/sexy at all times. 

When we met we were both on the heels of ended relationships, and I wasn't fully over an ex prior to the person I had broken up with.I overshared with her too many details about those relationships including sexual stuff. I admit talking aboutone ex in particular a lot and liking their instagram pics/leaving comments. This gave wife the ick and made her feel insecure/inadequate for the first couple years of our relationship, and she has admitted she agreed to stuff she wasn't comfortable with in order to keep things intact. 

I began to understand her viewpoint and stopped the behaviors that were bothering her. I ended up proposing and we got married. She is the most incredible wife. However in spite of telling me that she is happy with me she occasionally expresses bitterness about the fact that I made her feel like she was the ""safe"" choice and as a result, she felt desexualized for awhiel, and that she was useless unless she was making my life easier. 

Idk what else I could do to make her feel better. I changed behaviors to make her happy yet she is still resentful that we had no carefree ""Honeymoon"" period of our relationship because of my actions, and that she thinks I act like not liking my exes pictures was a big ""sacrifice"" on my end. 

She started making a ton of money a couple of years ago she's brilliant and deserves it. as a result of having more resources for self care she got a weekly therapist and personal trainer, and is now transformed into a baddie. keeps getting hotter and is somehow even sexier than she was when I met her 11 years ago. 

But she posts a lot of selfies. Like 4-5x week. I don't understand why a wife would do this. I did lots of things for her, not talking to or liking exes or other womens pictures. I gently brought it up, telling her that I would feel more secure with less frequency especially of the gym pics, and she gotdefensive. Said she feels better about herself on her own accord than I ever made her feel, and that it's her right to be  confident in  her body, insulting that I would assume that it's for male attention. Was I out of line in asking her to stop?

100,1fbr1kv,AITAH for calling the non emergency hotline when I smelled gas instead of calling my landlord?," I (25f) just called the non emergency hotline because I smelled gas in my apartment, and my landlord (~60ishM) loudly scolded me in front of all of my neighbors. Am I in the wrong here?

I smelled a little bit of gas earlier today around 5pm, and didn’t think much of it, but when I returned home at 11pm the smell was overwhelming. I wasn’t sure what to do, so I called the non emergency hotline, checked in with my neighbors (it’s a multiplex), and texted my landlord to let him know the fire department was on the way. My neighbors also smelled the gas, but it wasn’t as strong for them.

The fire department came very quickly, and my landlord was right behind them. There were lights everywhere, two fire trucks, everyone was watching, and I felt really embarrassed. It turns out my next door neighbors had just moved out, and the gas smell came from the lines being shut off in their apartment? I’m not sure I understand, but when they opened the door to my neighbors’ apartment the smell was really strong, I could smell it 15 feet away. 

The firemen left pretty soon after that and said it wasn’t an issue, but as soon as they stepped away my landlord started berating me in front of my neighbors for not calling him first. 

He said that this has happened before, I should have known that the smell was there because my neighbor moved out (I didn’t even know that they’d moved), and that the last time this happened to him they shut the gas off for months and fined him thousands of dollars. I asked him if we were going to get our gas shut off or if he was going to get fined because of me and he said “not yet” but it was clear he was mad. Normally I would have called him first, but it was 11pm and I didn’t know if he would respond or what he could have done in an emergency. 

AITAH here? I didn’t think it seemed like something to call my landlord about, but my city doesn’t have a super reliable government usually so maybe there was an unspoken rule that I should have known, or maybe the neighbor moving out thing was common knowledge.

I wasn’t sure what to do, so I called the non emergency hotline, checked in with my neighbors (it’s a multiplex), and texted my landlord to let him know the fire department was on the way. My neighbors also smelled the gas, but it wasn’t as strong for them.

The fire department came very quickly, and my landlord was right behind them. There were lights everywhere, two fire trucks, everyone was watching, and I felt really embarrassed. It turns out my next door neighbors had just moved out, and the gas smell came from the lines being shut off in their apartment? I’m not sure I understand, but when they opened the door to my neighbors’ apartment the smell was really strong, I could smell it 15 feet away. 

The firemen left pretty soon after that and said it wasn’t an issue, but as soon as they stepped away my landlord started berating me in front of my neighbors for not calling him first. 

He said that this has happened before, I should have known that the smell was there because my neighbor moved out (I didn’t even know that they’d moved), and that the last time this happened to him they shut the gas off for months and fined him thousands of dollars. I asked him if we were going to get our gas shut off or if he was going to get fined because of me and he said “not yet” but it was clear he was mad. Normally I would have called him first, but it was 11pm and I didn’t know if he would respond or what he could have done in an emergency. 

AITAH here? I didn’t think it seemed like something to call my landlord about, but my city doesn’t have a super reliable government usually so maybe there was an unspoken rule that I should have known, or maybe the neighbor moving out thing was common knowledge. ",0.0,0.0025019504,0,1
101,1fbqx4l,WIBTA for using my friends gift,"I, 15F, have a friend [16M] (we’ll call him Z) whose birthday is today, the 8th.

Some context first, recently he’s been sending multiple voice messages instead of texting which makes things harder for me because 1. I have a hearing loss and miss out on words a lot and 2. My speakers are blown out a bit too so it makes it harder for me to understand what he says. Sometimes he has issues with his phone too as it’s overall just a bit faulty. I told him to stop making voice messages as they make it difficult for me to know what he says so he stopped for a while then kept doing it despite me telling him.

We have a gc with our friends and he sent voice messages in there which I listened to and he said that his birthday party would be at a bowling place on the 8th at 4pm. So I was fine with that.

I go to school with Z so I took the chance to ask him to tell me so I know for sure about the party, if it was on Sun or Sat as I know his parents don’t like going out on Sundays to which he then said “it’s on Sat” instead of Sun like he said. At 8 in the morning I messaged him asking “What time should I get there to meet you guys?” to which he ignores it and responds (with a voice note) talking about releasing a song on his birthday (it’s a project we’ve both been working on as I’ve been making the album cover). Obviously I was confused but I asked him again later and he said 4. This was the reassurance I needed.

I get all my errands done and pick up card & gift. I finally get to the bowling place and wait in the car with my dad as he didn’t want to drive off yet considering he doesn’t trust Z too well. I texted Z and my bsf M, who was also invited, if he was at the party yet. He calls me immediately and asks “Are you at the bowling place?” I respond yes because it’s Z’s party today. He then goes on to tell me that Z should have said that it wasn’t. He adds Z to the call and when I explain the whole thing Z just laughs at me and says “oh my god”. I was irritated because I gave him multiple chances to say if it was actually a diff day or not. He said that he sent a voice msg in the gc saying it was on the 28th. His parents are busy on his birthday. He forwards the voice msg over which to me sounds like he’s saying the 8th. I can’t at all hear the “20” part but even if I did and forgot, I still asked him multiple times if I did get the date right.

My bsf understands my annoyance. My dad said to use the gift for myself because it was rude what Z did w/o apologising. My mum says I would be petty for using the gift and to give it to him tomorrow when I see him at school.

So WIBTAH?

102,1fbqus3,AITAH for holding to my rules about paying for my children’s education? ,"I am a single mother to 3 daughters. Twins 21f and ‘Alice’ 19f. I told my daughters since they were in elementary school that if they pursued higher education, I would pay for it. They would not have to take out loans or worry whatsoever. This applied to any sort of program, university, community college, trade, etc. 

My only rules were that they were to share their grades with me at the end of each semester of course and that they must go straight into whatever program they chose. No gap years or going back to school when they were older. I always encouraged college, but in no way forced it. 

One of my twins took me up on this and she is currently a senior with a major in psychology, and my other twin did not and is currently in the tattoo artist industry. They are both kicking ass and I’m equally proud of them both. 

However, Alice informed me while she was a senior in high school that she wanted to take a gap year. When I asked what she planned to do during this gap year, she said something like “relax before having to be in the real world.” She said she wanted to go to college, just not right away. She also said she did not plan to work during this time. I told her she had the whole summer to relax, but she held strong and wanted her gap year. I said fine, but not to expect me to fund her schooling a year from now. She brushed me off. If she had planned to do something productive or literally anything with the gap year (internship etc) I would have had a different attitude towards this. 

Flash forward to September and Alice has done exactly that for the last 4 months, relax. She sleeps until 2 and has not gotten a job. She has a car and the means to do so, but simply does not wish to. The topic of her going to school next year got brought up by her and she asked if I would pay. I said no, and that she knew this. I told her I would be happy to help her, but would not be paying in full. She blew up on me, asking if I was serious and saying how unfair I was. She yelled at me and called me a bitch for paying for her sisters college in full but not hers. I reminded her of our conversation and how she knew my stance since she was a little girl. I also asked her if she had applied for scholarships or done anything to start trying to help with these funds, she had not. 

I told her since I was retiring in 2025, I did not have the funding to pay for her schooling in full anymore and that I had to start thinking about saving for myself and my future. I said she had missed her chance. 

She is very angry and has barely been speaking to me. I feel bad, but I also don’t. I feel like this will be the first of many things in her life to teach her some responsibility. She had her opportunity to have her schooling paid for and she knew this, but chose to do nothing for a year. She can absolutely still go to college and I will help foot the bill, but she would definitely have to take out some loans. I’m really not sure how to talk to her about this. AITAH?

Edited to add a few things*
As far as my retirement, if Alice had attended college this fall, I would not be retiring in 2025. I probably would have pushed it until at least 2027. I chose to retire sooner because I knew that I would not be paying for the entirety of another child’s schooling.

For those saying Alice may have needed the gap year for mental health reasons, this has never been communicated to me by her. She has never exhibited signs of mental health issues. She has friends, did well in school, goes out, etc. If she needed this gap for mental health reasons and told me as such, I would have an extremely different attitude. But like I stated, she just wanted it “to relax.” 

As far as why I’m “against” gap years. I am not necessarily against them. I just always expressed to my children the importance of hard work, responsibility, and using your time wisely. I wanted to avoid this exact scenario, having one of my children living with me not working, not going to school, or contributing to society/our household at all. I’ll clarify again that if Alice had been working, doing an internship, studying abroad, peace corps, any volunteer work, I would reconsider this rule. But sitting around in her bed all day for 9 months and expecting me to be okay with that, and still pay full tuition, will just not fly in my home. 

Somebody has asked if I paid for my twin who is in the tattoo artist business. I did. She has loved art and tattoos since she was a young teenager, drawing them, planning her own tattoos. So I had a pretty good idea that she wanted to make a career out of this. I encouraged her to do so and she found herself an apprenticeship right out of high school. I paid for everything she needed with it. It is truly her passion. 

To answer is Alice knows what she wants to do- she does. She has known what she wanted to major in since she was 15. She still wants to major in this. So it is not a matter of needing time to “figure it out.” ",Not enough info,2024-09-08,"AITAH for holding to my rules about paying for my children’s education?  I am a single mother to 3 daughters.

Emma, my friend Gwen and other girls are like friends.

Then there is Andrew 20, he is preparing for government exam also, he is from well off family.

2. Why Andrew ghosted her after banging her?

I don't get it what is happening and what should I do should I avoid emma and Andrew.

108,1fbqibf,AITA for doing extra work in front of my coworkers?,"I work an events company that runs concerts, shows and sporting events. We have like 11 different departments since what we do takes a lot of manpower.

I work in a department called “Guest Service” where our primary responsibility is ensuring the guests are happy, the show runs smoothly and the exit is efficient. We do a little bit of everything and work with pretty much all departments.

I was recently promoted to Supervisor after only 10 months of work. I am only 23 years old and am the youngest supervisor by far, some of the other Supervisors have been working there for over 30 years. I really got this job cuz I go the extra mile and try to work both hard and smart. My only goal is really to help people out, regardless of if they are in my department.

The department we work the most with is Security, since we have to use metal detectors at all the gates when we scan tickets. They also help us eject guests, clear out the arena after the show is over and enforce rules before it becomes a bigger issue. Despite us all being on the same company, there has been beef for years (it seems) between our departments. Some security heads think my department’s people are clueless and soft with no idea how hard security works. Some people in our department think security needlessly escalates situations by rigorously enforcing arbitrary rules and having poor attitudes. I think there are people in each department that are both at fault and innocent.

For me, the relevance is that I offered to clean Security radios in our office since all our supplies is in the same spot. I was told security radios are NEVER CLEANED, ever, which includes being handled by 250+ different people on top of the thousands of guests who come into contact with security. I spoke to the head of security who told me they were absolutely cool with it. 

However, when I asked my boss and also some people on my level, they told me to stay out of their business. The person who usually runs the office, who has been working there for 37 years and is at the same level as me, wants to “sit down and have a talk with me” next time we work together. When she saw me cleaning radios the other day, she snapped at me in front of my coworkers. I don’t really know what to do because this is absolutely a health hazard but my boss told me to stay out of it. And it really bothers me, being someone who also is chronically ill with a weak immune system.

My mum just turned around and told me that her relationship with my dad is ‘not my business’ but how could it not be when I see her breakdown over it. I love my mom more than anything in the world, everything I do is in hopes of making her happier each day, she was both a mom and dad to me growing up and even though our relationship hasn’t been perfect, I truly would do anything for her.

114,1fbozs1,AITA for questioning superstitions,"My (15M) mom (45F) is pretty superstitious. Our religion has many rituals (will not disclose due to privacy reasons) and my mom is pretty religious.

For the past couple of years, I have been questioning my religion a bit more and not just blindly following everything.

Yesterday (Friday), I noticed my nails were long and wanted to clip them. My mom saw me about to start and told me I should wait. For some reason, we should not clip our nails on Friday.

Whenever I ask why we cannot do any of these superstitious things, she basically says that our ancestors were very smart and we are still trying to figure out why they did what they did. She gives an example as the use of turmeric in many foods and traditions. Turmeric is very healthy and has many benefits.

She thinks that this one example (lucky guess?) is enough to prove that all rituals and superstitions in our culture are connected to some reason that scientists haven't discovered yet.

So I basically refused and cut my nails anyway. Now she is a little mad at me, and my dad says that I should just go along. My dad is not very religious, but still follows all these superstitions.

But I am honestly tired of just doing random shit and pretending that it has some purpose. As stated above, I am questioning my religion a bit more, and this has led to more instances of me just thinking, ""Why?""

fast forward to today (this maybe happened 2 weeks ago) - im out of state and saw an inexpensive ($3) sticker set at a gift shop which had looked like something she would like. i messaged her and asked if she likes stickers and she asked why. i sent a photo of the stickers and she said she has enough and prefers the flat/non puffy/3d stickers (which i can understand). i KNEW that there was a pretty high probability that she wouldn’t want them but i still felt a little down afterwards.

116,1fboerm,AITA for not helping my locked out roommate and being petty? ,"I (20f) do not get along with my roommates (18-19f). They tend to gang up on and blame me for things because they are all friends and they treat me as if I am stupid. I obviously fight back so now we all mostly ignore each other.

Another thing is I usually spend most of my time at my boyfriend’s (20m) place. But this is only because of how much I cannot stand my roommates. Sometimes if I have to collect things from my room or get a package my bf will come with me and wait. But the last time this happened my roommates (who were all home) approached him and started asking him why he was dating me of all people and just being passive aggressive overall. They said things like “Oh you guys just don’t look that good together” and “I never would’ve guessed you two would ever date” or “I can imagine you with x type of girl not her.” One was being super touchy as well. 

Maybe I’m overreacting but I was uncomfortable and my bf got bad vibes as well so now he waits in the car. 

Anyways, I was at work when one roommate called. I was confused because that never happens but well I answered and she told me that she lost her key and has been locked out of the house. She wanted me to let her in. I explained to her that I’m at work and she suggested I hand the key over to my bf and have him open the door for her. I said sorry and to ask someone else.

She said everyone else is busy. I said I am too. She said “I bet ur bf isn’t” and I said “well he is, ask one of ur friends instead of bothering me” then hung up. Well apparently she was locked out till 10pm at night (no I didn’t check up on her because I didn’t care) and when I went back home the other day that roommate and one other were annoyed with me and said that they couldn’t believe I’d let a young girl stay out all night and that I need to put my ego aside for things like this. They also accused me of not trusting my bf and being insecure+having an unstable relationship. I told them that there were 5 other girls and 2 of them have bfs too, she could’ve asked them, especially since they’re all such good friends. But she changed the topic back to me wanting her to stay out all night and possibly get hurt. Which is ridiculous, I genuinely don’t care. 

I told her to get over herself and that she could’ve waited at a cafe or a library or school (everything 5 mins away and open till 11pm) instead of trying to make a scene and wait outside for 5 hours just because my bf wouldn’t come open the door for her. She then asked if I even asked him but I just left because what? Lol. 

Anyways, my other roommates think I’m horrible (more than before) and that I’m petty and not a “girl’s girl.” I didn’t respond to their messages. I have to stay at my house for two days straight next week so I’m just wondering if maybe I am the AH here? If so I will apologize. But otherwise I can deal with their bullshit. AITA?

I (20f) do not get along with my roommates (18-19f). They tend to gang up on and blame me for things because they are all friends and they treat me as if I am stupid. I obviously fight back so now we all mostly ignore each other.

Another thing is I usually spend most of my time at my boyfriend’s (20m) place. But this is only because of how much I cannot stand my roommates. Sometimes if I have to collect things from my room or get a package my bf will come with me and wait. But the last time this happened my roommates (who were all home) approached him and started asking him why he was dating me of all people and just being passive aggressive overall. They said things like “Oh you guys just don’t look that good together” and “I never would’ve guessed you two would ever date” or “I can imagine you with x type of girl not her.” One was being super touchy as well. 

Maybe I’m overreacting but I was uncomfortable and my bf got bad vibes as well so now he waits in the car. 

Anyways, I was at work when one roommate called. I was confused because that never happens but well I answered and she told me that she lost her key and has been locked out of the house. She wanted me to let her in. I explained to her that I’m at work and she suggested I hand the key over to my bf and have him open the door for her. I said sorry and to ask someone else.

She said everyone else is busy. I said I am too. She said “I bet ur bf isn’t” and I said “well he is, ask one of ur friends instead of bothering me” then hung up.

Our mother joined a parent Facebook group for the university. Ok. No big deal. But then our mother made a post along the lines of “My daughter Dylan is 18 and starting her freshman year, I’m looking for friends for her. Please reach out if you’re interested.”



Our mother didn’t seem to see anything wrong with it because her own friend thought it was “sweet.” Everyone else I talked to told me that they thought what I did, which is that Dylan’s too old to be doing something like this. She’s not 10, and even doing this at that age would be questionable, in my opinion. 



I also found out after talking to our mother that she’s been trying to email Dylan’s professors on Dylan’s behalf to ask for special treatment (i.e. asking that Dylan be allowed to eat snacks in her lab.) And my mother’s frustrated because they aren’t responding back. Our mother has definitely always been a helicopter to Dylan, but this was just a whole new level. 



Mother reached out to me this time because Dylan is in her 3rd week of school and hasn’t really met anyone yet. Our mother told me that a few parents from the Facebook group sent her their kids’ numbers, but none of the kids responded back to Dylan, which upset Dylan.



Our mother asked me if I could try reaching out to other kids at Dylan’s school and asking them to be my sister’s friends. And also if I could potentially find someone working within an office or an administration council to address why Dylan’s professors haven’t replied back to our mother.



I told her that this was insane! I never even went to Dylan’s college, how the heck would I have an easier time getting in touch with people there than Dylan would? I told our mother that, furthermore, she needs to stop babying Dylan. I would be mortified if she had done something like that to me in my freshman year of college. She’s way too old for this and Dylan needs to find her own way socially.



Our mother called me ungrateful because she paid for my college, which she had no obligation to do after I turned 18. And I could have done this one thing to help her and my sister. I understand she had no obligation to help with my college and I’m grateful she helped. But what I said was something that she needed to hear about Dylan.



I talked to my friends, and while they all agreed that what my mother was asking was crazy, most said I had better ways to deal with it than starting a fight. They said that I could I have pretended to reach out to people and then claimed I had no luck, just to make her feel better.

I (30M) had planned a surprise weekend getaway for my girlfriend (28F). I was excited because I had booked everything in advance and kept it a secret for weeks. A couple of days before the trip, I casually mentioned to my neighbor (35F) that I had planned something special for the weekend and my girlfriend would be out of town. The neighbor didn't say much, just kind of nodded, and I didn’t think much of it.

Later that day, my neighbor asked my girlfriend if she was busy over the weekend and if she could look after their cats while they went away. My girlfriend, being the nice person she is, agreed without hesitation, assuming she didn’t have any plans.

Fast forward to the weekend, I finally reveal the surprise trip to my girlfriend, and she’s thrilled. But then she remembers she agreed to look after the neighbor's cats. She apologizes, and now we’re stuck because she feels bad backing out of the commitment.

I was furious because I had already told the neighbor about the surprise weekend. They knew we were going away but still asked her to do them a favor. I confronted the neighbor and ended up shouting at them for putting my girlfriend in an awkward situation when they knew we had plans.

Now, my girlfriend thinks I overreacted, and the neighbor is upset with me for being rude. I feel like I was justified because I had planned this special weekend, and it got ruined. But now I’m second-guessing myself.

119,1fbo2iw,AITA for refusing to hide that I'm dieting and working out on vacation despite my friend repeatedly saying it makes her uncomfortable?,"Four of my friends all have flexible jobs or are off for the week, and Sasha’s uncle has a hunting cabin he said we could stay in. (Respect to Jed, he’s the best). We just spent our first night/day together and it was great, except that Vivain says she’s uncomfortable because it feels like I’m not relaxing/enjoying the trip. I think I’m uncomfortable being told what to do, and that working out and dieting is important to my job. I’m a model, this isn’t something I can just blow off.

She had approached me about this more mildly before we left, making a few comments about me ‘eating real food’ and I just redirected it with a comment about how I was looking forward to get some smoked venison from a nearby farm. She sent back a laughing emoji but seemed pretty annoyed, saying I ‘knew what she meant’ and should ‘make sure to relax and indulge’, and that if I ‘wouldn’t stop looking in my mirror enough to enjoy myself, she’d break it.’ Which seemed. Weird.

But I moved on and didn’t think about it until today. I worked out this morning while she was sketching in the main room and when we got dessert at lunch, I ordered another drink instead. I also skipped out when we got ice cream, and I think that’s what finally set her off because it looked the most awkward. When we got back, she pulled me aside like a teacher reprimanding a student, which rankled me to start with, and then started in on how I was being weird, uptight, and snotty. I don’t think I’m being any of those things and told her so. She said I needed to stop working out in the mornings and acting like I care more about my waistline than my friends.

I might be the AH because she seemed genuinely upset and had brought this up before, and I brushed it off. Also, I am being kind of petty here. A), I could go somewhere else. I’m sure there’s a library or even just some park pavilion nearby where I could work out and then come back to the house. B), I could probably get away with not working out for the week, though then I’d have to watch my diet even more and it’ll suck to get into the full routine again.

She says I’m being high- maintenance and making everything about me - that I’ll be ruining the trip for at least her and her boyfriend and probably make everyone else feel uncomfortable. I’m not trying to interrupt the trip here or anything, just chill without ordering food sometimes! But also, I’ve been told I’m high maintenance / self obsessed / vain a lot and I’m trying to work on that, so maybe this would be a good step in the right direction even if I don’t HAVE to listen to her.

Sorry if this is rambly, I drove us most of last night to get here and my mind is dead lol.

Edit: I'm a man if that matters! Just realized I didn't specify.

120,1fbntn1,AITA: husband wants my son to be available to watch our dogs alone whenever we go on an adult only trip during school session and I do not. ,"Hi, 

Anonymous account made as my son/ family have Reddit accounts. 

Husband and I are out of town currently for the weekend and we have my teenaged son (husbands stepson) watching our dogs while we’re away this weekend. In our discussion during dinner, my husband had commented that since things are going well with our son and the dogs so far, maybe we’d consider having him stay home with the dogs as well if we ever wanted to take a week long adults trip. I commented that I would not be comfortable with that if it was during the school season as I’d rather he focus on school more than worrying about caring for dogs on days he’d have to attend school ( he’s in high school). An argument then ensued. I tried to explain that if the situation ever arises and my son declines having to care for the dogs then I would not force him to. I’d rather he focus on school than have him wake up an extra hour earlier to ensure he walks and feeds the dogs before he heads to school. These dogs have been primarily mine and my husbands responsibility, we don’t typically put their care onto our children unless we went out for a couples dinner (2-3 hours max) about once a month. They are well behaved dogs. One has a bit more energy exertion than the other but they aren’t much to handle. 

This was all hypothetical. My husband was angry with my response. He thinks we need to teach him responsibility and by doing this (if it ever came to it) would teach him so. However, I feel that my son is quite responsible as is. He’s been working in his dad’s business since he was 12 (restaurant), has been saving 85-90% of his earnings and keeping the rest as spending money. He’s had saved over $8,000 by the time he was 12, he’s now 16. I personally don’t think I need to “teach” him how to be responsible as he’s shown me for the past 4 years how responsible he is with his ability to save money and cook for himself and his younger sibling when required. He’s an honour role student ( 96 avg) as well. If this were to come up, I feel like I would not force him to watch dogs if he expressed to me that he wasn’t comfortable at the same time as having to attend high school. Additionally, he attends a catholic school, so they’re a bit more strict when it comes to academics than when he was in public. My husband and I are currently not speaking since he thinks I’m being unreasonable over this. So please let me know who is the AH in this situation, myself or my husband?

I 24f purchased a MacBook on my partners 27Ms 25th birthday after knowing he was wanting to start his business and YouTube channel I went and bought him a MacBook/desk to be supportive and surprised him.  After having it for 1mth his brother, 19M, asked to borrow it because he makes music and wanted to use some of the MacBook features. The week of him having it his cat scratched it and broke the screen,I was very frustrated but knew that we would be expecting him to pay for the damages. As time went on my partner never asked him to fix the MacBook and his brother would continue using it.  
I have mentioned to my partner multiple times that he needs to ask for it back and he says he won’t be doing that and that he is letting him use it since does not have much use for it now as his business was on hold  after having multiple arguments dating back from 2022-2024 I am completely overwhelmed with how inconsiderate he has been to the gift I gifted him to help him do what has always wanted to do.
We did break up in 2023 for 6 mths and in that time I was  caring for our son on my own staying at my moms, he gifted my a gold bracelet that was given to his mom from his dad who is still part of his life but was never part of his life as a kid, during the break up I wasn’t financially stable to care for my son and sold the bracelet for $300,When we got back together, he asked me if I still had it, and I told him where it went.He told me I was very inconsiderate and that that bracelet had sentimental value to where I did not see it as a sentimental, he would have asked for it back when we broke up if it had value. I didn’t do it intentionally hurt him I simply needed money to support me and his son, but back to the computer.Later this week he came home with a computer
I was angry and did not make a comment about it when he stated he purchased it to be able to edit his videos and run his business,the next day I asked him if he plans to get the MacBook back from his brother as he replies with no we had an argument about it and he said if you can get me that bracelet back you can have the computer back.After we exchanged a few words, I let him know that getting his bracelet back was not possible and that if he needed me to pay him back for it I could  but that the computer needed to be returned.
He later says that he sold the computer to his brother after we broke up because he “also needed money” to where I do not believe because he is financially stable. 
We ended the conversation where I let him know I will be reaching out to his mom to let his now 21yr old son know that he either needs to pay me the $1099 plus the damages or keep it and pay me $1099 for just the computer.I am very aware that maybe selling that bracelet wasn’t the right thing to do but as a mom at 22 who needed money for her 1 year old I know I did what I could. This has never been a computer, and the bracelet argument up until a year later that I sold the bracelet it became that.

The new place is about 30 minutes away and we also took the highway.

During a couple of these back and forths my friend offered to take the truck back from the new place to the old place by himself while I stayed behind and did other stuff. So basically the driver of the truck was switching all the time. All of this was two weeks ago.

Just yesterday I got a mail from UHaul saying that there's a traffic violation on my account and I had no idea. Apparently this also voids some insurance and deposits I gave to them and it could mean I could never rent from them again. Basically the truck I rented got a speed ticket on highway from one of those photo enforcers and the ticket was seriously costly including all the fees I would have to pay to UHaul. 

Now at first I wasn't sure who was driving the truck but when I looked at the time on the ticket, it was like 15 minutes after a text I'd recieved from him saying he was on his way to my new place with some stuff he picked up. So it was pretty clear it had to be him.

I asked him kindly if he could pay up and he's refusing to do so. He said there's no way he was speeding cause he is a ""good driver,"" he knows he wasn't driving the truck when it happened, and I'm being ungrateful for the whole day he gave up to help me. I tried calling him and he just shouted at me and then blocked me.

I tried explaining this to the UHaul people, who told me first, it was technically against the contract for another person to be driving without registering in with UHaul (only my licence was in their system). And secondly, even if I want to recover the fines from him, there has to be clear proof he was driving it, which I don't really have.

On top of all this, I heard from someone else about how he was gloating about getting out of a ticket, so he def knows he's in the wrong and lied to me.

124,1fbmict,AITAH for asking my mom to come home at an early time?,"I (15F), do not live with my mom. It's been that way forever due to her old drug problem from when I was a kid. (She's never been all that great of a mom, or all that caring, but she's trying, and I can't ask for much more than that. And my father died of overdose, so she's all I have left.)

My mother likes to go out sometimes. Usually, it's whatever. But I can't lie, I do sometimes feel a bit hurt knowing she'd rather go hookup with some guy than stay home and spend time with me, especially because I'm not always at her house.

I don't love it when she goes out when I'm supposed to spend the night. And I know, she's an adult and she can do what she wants. But it makes me uncomfortable being home alone late at night, even when I know that nothing bad will likely happen. She's never listened to me about makes me uncomfortable when it comes to her relationships, even after one of the guys I warned her about left her alone with two babies, and at least three if them have made creepy comments toward me.

I called her while she was out because some guy came to the door looking for her. I recognized his voice because he yelled through the window, but didn't open the door or let him in. She didn't answer until the fourth call.

I asked her when she was coming home, she said she doesn't know and that she doesn't have a curfew. She's done this before, though, and didn't end up coming home until 2 am because she was getting busy, even when she told me she'd be home at 12. 

I tried to tell her that I wanted her home at the time that she told me (nine) and she continued to tell me she doesn't have a curfew, and that I'm old enough to be home alone and that I have everything I need. And, fair enough. (She's was also out of state and needed time to get home.)

I understand that she's an adult, and she can do what she wants. I totally get that, and I want her to do what makes her happy.

But at the same time, she does have a kid waiting for her at home who's told her many times that they don't feel comfortable being home alone so late.

What I try to tell her is that she had her own time to do all that. The time when I'm not here, and she doesn't have anyone at home waiting for her. Now that im back in school, that will be more often, too. I don't blame her for wanting to go out, but I just ask that she comes home early enough, or at the time she said she would.

While there my family keeps asking if my moms on drugs and I say no I don’t believe so(honestly was believing she was clean until this trip) then they start telling me she doesn’t seem mentally okay and they think she needs help mentally.

We get to the airport to leave and my husband has walked away to talk to his parents and our children and let them know we are about to board our first flight. My mom gets up to get food and goes straight to him and starts recording him for no reason. I watch the bags. She comes back I ask her to watch the bags while I do the same and go get food.

126,1fbm8bm,AITA for telling my girlfriend I hope she feels guilty every time she goes out with her friends? ,"My gf (20f) and I (19f) have been dating since high school. In hs, two girls, Sarah and Uma, bullied me.

Sarah copied my work often, without me knowing. She was a self-proclaimed ""people pleaser,"" well-liked by everyone. Bc I asked her to stop using my work, she started a school-wide rumor that I didn't like her.

I’m happy to help ppl out, but in this case, I was getting failing grades and facing serious academic discipline for plagiarism bc she repeatedly copied me word-for-word w/o my knowing. My reputation became the ""the girl who didn't like Sarah,"" and bc everyone liked her, I was seen as awful for supposedly hating a ""kind"" person. Random ppl would ask me why I didn't like her and it became a big thing that made me want to disappear. I felt so embarrassed trying to explain that I had nothing against her to ppl who wouldn't believe me. For a while, Sarah also texted my best friend that I was ""weird"" and ""mean"" and ""hated her,"" I'm guessing to drive us apart.

Uma pretended to be my friend so she could copy my work (common theme). Again, I don't mind helping ppl. But when I realized she was just using me it hurt. Once she invited me to her bday party, and I dressed up for it and got her a gift. I was about to leave home and l asked for her address, and she replied, ""for what?"" She then sent a follow up text asking to copy my hw. Uma also became fixated with a close friend of mine and made many clear attempts to ""steal"" her from me (her words), constantly telling me and others that my friend liked Uma more and was her friend and not mine.

When Liz and I started dating, she started getting close with Sarah and Uma, as they were best friends with Liz's close friend, Miley. The three come together. As Liz started getting to know Sarah and Uma, I told her I was uncomfy with her hanging out with them bc they'd really hurt me in the past, and I cared a lot for her and was worried about them hurting her in that way.

Also, selfishly, it hurt me that Liz was growing to love these people who made me feel terrible. I've been bullied fr before and know that this stuff was stupid, but at the time, as a sensitive young teen, it hurt.

Now, Liz loves them and hangs out w/ them often when she’s home for breaks. When she goes out with them, I feel stressed and a part of me hopes she feels guilty for hanging out with these people who have hurt me. We argue when I say that her being close with them makes me anxious. Any time I express discomfort Liz calls them my “mortal enemies.” I feel like I’m blowing it out of proportion.

I want to cut work early on the friday and leave just before midday, there are 2 reasons for this, I want to catch up with my friend and the others that are arriving early friday, I also want to avoid the traffic of the great exodus that is friday evening as people leave the city for the weekend. I've told my GF that I wanted to head up early friday and that it would be best that she just drives dirctly from her country work to the end location, there is a 15-20 minutes difference in travel time if she where to directly or if she were to come to my place first. If she were to come to my place first, there is still an hours drive we'd have to do. She is making a big argument about this, that she wants me to wait for her to finish work, dive to my home then we go up together. By the time she gets to mine the exodus will be in full swing turning an hours drive into a 2 hour drive. I'm frustrated, I don't want to miss out on the \~7 hours of being up on the coast by leaving early and I do not want to drive in traffic.  Am I the arse of expecting my GF to drive directly to the end location instead of through mine first?",0.0,1.0243937,1,0
131,1fbld1x,AITA for spoiling my kids,"Throw away account. I (41f) have been divorced from my ex husband (42M) since 2018. It was about as amicable as a divorce can go. We have 2 kids together (18, 15) and split them 50/50. There's no alimony or child support payments on either side, since we do both take care of them equally. 

For about the past 2 years, he's had a live in girlfriend and she has kids around the ages of our boys. I'm not going to lie, I barely know them but we're all cordial, however I don't have their exact ages, other than teens. I know she has one college age, one in high school, and one in Middle school. 

So for one remaining bit of backstory - he and I are both also Alcoholics in recovery.

I've been clean for a few years now, working on everything blah blah blah, but I initially found myself with about an extra $900 a month. I've built up savings, but still wanted to actually do things I've wanted to do. So as a part of that, I've been getting a lot of experiences for myself and my kids. On my weeks we go to concerts, plays, fairs, short vacations (When they're not in school) That sort of thing. I'm still actually spending less on this than I was on alcohol, and let's be honest, it keeps me distracted. The kids enjoy it, and I don't know how to say this other than attendance isn't necessary. It's more of ""this band I like is coming to town, do you want to see them?"" and if yes, I take them. 

But recently this has been causing issues with his girlfriends kids. She has full custody of them, and they've been getting jealous of everything my kids get to do on their weeks with me. I really don't think it's excessive honestly, not every night or even every week since I don't have them every week. We go out specifically 'for a thing' maybe twice a month, and it gets all of us out of the house. 

Today I took them to the State Fair, and came home to a huge text about how much I'm spoiling them and trying to ""make him look bad"". That isn't my intent. Honestly, if I have any intent it's trying to make up lost time, and keep myself on a better path. 

for clarification, none of these things has cost over $200, beyond the concert I took my kid to for their 18th birthday (Those tickets were $200 each, but it was a birthday/graduation gift).

132,1fbl6uc,AITA for paying my girlfriends bills after she told me not?,"I (M36) have been dating my girlfriend (F28) for about seven months now. She's currently working two jobs, one of which as a barista which is how we met, to support herself and her family while also putting herself through medical school. She's the sole breadwinner since her father is terminally ill and her brother is still in highschool.

When we first met, she declined going out with me because she said she didn't have the time for relationships. I told her I was okay with that and we hung out for about two months just as friends. After spending all that time with each other, she told me she was wanting to explore a relationship with me and we've been going out ever since.

I'm currently in a place in my life and my career where I'm more than financially stable. I own my own company and I've been very fortunate with investments to the point where I no longer want for anything. And from the beginning, I've offered my girlfriend financial help wherever I can, whether that's with her school fees, rent, her father's medical bills, whatever she needs I'm more than willing to pay for. But she has vehemently rejected my help, even to the point of threatening to break up with me. And I've refrained until now, which is where I think I'm the asshole.

Recently her father's condition has taken an extreme turn for the worse and the expenses are piling way too high and too fast for her to keep up with. She's always insisted to me that she doesn't need my help and that she's perfectly capable of supporting her family, which I have no doubts about, but I love her so, so much and watching her work herself to death is agonising for me. So despite all of her insisting and the possibility of our relationship ending, I decided to pay some of her pressing bills without telling her. I didn't want to overdo it so I really only took care of her rent for the next few months as well as some the higher medical bills.

When she found out, we had the biggest fight of our relationship. I understand her wanting to be independent and to not want to feel like she owes me something but that’s nowhere close to why I did what I did. All I wanted to do was alleviate some of her stress but she refuses to see my side of things.

Part of her argument was that I was selfish for helping out where she didn't want me to because she feels like I'm trying to be her saviour and that maybe I look down on her because I make more money than her, which admittedly hurt my feelings because its never been about money, its just been about my love for her. She also told me she needed space to think about everything and now we haven't spoken in three days. I want to respect her wishes but I really don't want to lose her either.
