0,1fcu8dg,WIBTAH for going by the name of my high school bully?,"WIBTAH for going by the name of my high school bully?

This is a weird one.

I (18F) have recently realized that I‚Äôm trans. I‚Äôm in the very early days of this revelation (I‚Äôve suspected it for a while but have only just now come to terms with it), so the only things I‚Äôve done is start a list of potential names, and have started an escape plan if needed, as I live in a very conservative Christian southern community.

In my early years of high school, I had a best friend, ‚ÄúVanny.‚Äù (17F) We got along great, and it was purely platonic. We were very fast friends, as we just kinda clicked, and had very similar backgrounds. About a year later, she stopped talking to me, and starting being really mean to me, such as walking away from me when a mutual friend left for class, approaching someone we shared a study hall with, and telling them that since the mutual friend had left, she no longer had anyone to hang out with. When I jokingly said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm offended,‚Äù she glances out of the corner of her eye at me, and said with no emotion whatsoever ‚ÄúYou should be‚Äù.

After a few months of similar treatment, such as a group of our friends talking and Vanny inviting everyone in the conversation to her house but me, I eventually distanced myself from the whole friend group. She never gave me a straight answer of why she did these things, and claimed to not remember them when I confronted her, and that the people she invited ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt been to her house in years‚Äù
(In recent times my current best friend who had a similar experience with Vanny said that Vanny did very similar things to her).

Fast forward several years, and I‚Äôve graduated HS. I want to try out some new names, and one that I‚Äôve wanted to use is Vanny‚Äôs name. I‚Äôve always really liked it, and I always felt something when I hear it. I assumed it was just the memories of what she did and wanting the old times back, but upon further reflection I remember feeling that when I first heard her name, so maybe that means I wanted it to be my name??

No one has told me their opinion on this as I haven‚Äôt told anyone, but I feel somewhat weird about it. Is it immoral to choose names that belong to people you know? Especially ones that have had a big influence on your life? I‚Äôm aware this is really weird. I still see Vanny occasionally as I volunteer at my old HS, but if I ever transition or go by a different name (Vanny or not), I would never see her or anyone else from my old community again anyway. (Except my now best friend). I‚Äôm not saying I would fully change my name to hers, but it‚Äôs a name I want to try, and I‚Äôm not gonna like try to impersonate her or anything weird like that.

TL:DR; I really like the name of my HS bully/ex best friend, and want to try going by her name. (I‚Äôm trans)

1,1fcdz49,AITA for telling my mother how I feel when she deadnames me?,"I (21MtF) transitioned a couple months ago, and I've had my new name since about July. For context, my mother loves me, I have absolutely no doubt about that, but when it comes to my transition, although she's been ""nice"" she's pushed back at absolutely every step of it. For example, when I first came out she immediately told me there were never any signs and that I'm not trans, she's tried to guilt me about my coming out because there was a family tragedy around the time I came out and so she had to deal with a lot at once, she compared my transition to my sheriff woody phase as a toddler, etc. It's not all bad, but she's given me a lot of reasons to doubt whether she actually supports me. 

Anyway, I've had a new name since July, and she's called me by that name unprompted exactly once. Whenever I correct her about the name, she gets frustrated, and on numerous occasions she's said she'll ""never get it"". She also doesn't want my 2 year old brother learning my new name since I'm supposedly just gonna change my mind about transition anyway, and it'll just confuse him. This is why I have doubts as to whether she's really trying with the new name. And to any cis people reading, being deadnamed is a huge slap in the face and it's incredibly disrespectful. I have been trying my best to be patient with her, but I hate how uncomfortable she makes me feel, so I sent her a message to explain how I feel.

I explained in no uncertain terms that if she wants to be a part of my life that the new name is just something she'll have to get used to. I told her that ""as long as you still see me as your son, you might 'love' me but you don't love the real me"", and that one of my biggest fears in transition is that she'll never see me as her daughter, so every time she deadnamed or misgendered me it was a reminder of those fears. It hurts so much because she's my mother and I care about her a lot. I told her that in no way do I expect her to get the name right every time, I just want some reassurance that she's trying, I made a few suggestions for what she could do to practice getting it right. She was deeply hurt by my message, telling me I'm ungrateful for the things she has done (like take me shopping for my birthday). She mentioned how much worse others have it, that I have no idea what it's like to not be accepted, and that I am ""watching too many podcasts"". She told me I can't expect her to just get it right all the time because she's called me by my old name for my whole life, but all I asked of her is that she at least try. On one hand I feel justified, but also I know that my transition is probably hard for her to adjust to, and it's only been months since I picked my name, which is why I worry a bit if I went too far with the message.

TLDR: she deadnames me frequently, I told her how much it hurts me when she does, she was hurt by my message.
