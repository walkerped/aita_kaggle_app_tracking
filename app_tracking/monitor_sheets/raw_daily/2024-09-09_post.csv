0,1fcu8dg,WIBTAH for going by the name of my high school bully?,"WIBTAH for going by the name of my high school bully?

This is a weird one.

I (18F) have recently realized that I‚Äôm trans. I‚Äôm in the very early days of this revelation (I‚Äôve suspected it for a while but have only just now come to terms with it), so the only things I‚Äôve done is start a list of potential names, and have started an escape plan if needed, as I live in a very conservative Christian southern community.

In my early years of high school, I had a best friend, ‚ÄúVanny.‚Äù (17F) We got along great, and it was purely platonic. We were very fast friends, as we just kinda clicked, and had very similar backgrounds. About a year later, she stopped talking to me, and starting being really mean to me, such as walking away from me when a mutual friend left for class, approaching someone we shared a study hall with, and telling them that since the mutual friend had left, she no longer had anyone to hang out with. When I jokingly said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm offended,‚Äù she glances out of the corner of her eye at me, and said with no emotion whatsoever ‚ÄúYou should be‚Äù.

After a few months of similar treatment, such as a group of our friends talking and Vanny inviting everyone in the conversation to her house but me, I eventually distanced myself from the whole friend group. She never gave me a straight answer of why she did these things, and claimed to not remember them when I confronted her, and that the people she invited ‚Äúhadn‚Äôt been to her house in years‚Äù
(In recent times my current best friend who had a similar experience with Vanny said that Vanny did very similar things to her).

Fast forward several years, and I‚Äôve graduated HS. I want to try out some new names, and one that I‚Äôve wanted to use is Vanny‚Äôs name. I‚Äôve always really liked it, and I always felt something when I hear it. I assumed it was just the memories of what she did and wanting the old times back, but upon further reflection I remember feeling that when I first heard her name, so maybe that means I wanted it to be my name??

No one has told me their opinion on this as I haven‚Äôt told anyone, but I feel somewhat weird about it. Is it immoral to choose names that belong to people you know? Especially ones that have had a big influence on your life? I‚Äôm aware this is really weird. I still see Vanny occasionally as I volunteer at my old HS, but if I ever transition or go by a different name (Vanny or not), I would never see her or anyone else from my old community again anyway. (Except my now best friend). I‚Äôm not saying I would fully change my name to hers, but it‚Äôs a name I want to try, and I‚Äôm not gonna like try to impersonate her or anything weird like that.

TL:DR; I really like the name of my HS bully/ex best friend, and want to try going by her name. (I‚Äôm trans)

1,1fcdz49,AITA for telling my mother how I feel when she deadnames me?,"I (21MtF) transitioned a couple months ago, and I've had my new name since about July. For context, my mother loves me, I have absolutely no doubt about that, but when it comes to my transition, although she's been ""nice"" she's pushed back at absolutely every step of it. For example, when I first came out she immediately told me there were never any signs and that I'm not trans, she's tried to guilt me about my coming out because there was a family tragedy around the time I came out and so she had to deal with a lot at once, she compared my transition to my sheriff woody phase as a toddler, etc. It's not all bad, but she's given me a lot of reasons to doubt whether she actually supports me. 

Anyway, I've had a new name since July, and she's called me by that name unprompted exactly once. Whenever I correct her about the name, she gets frustrated, and on numerous occasions she's said she'll ""never get it"". She also doesn't want my 2 year old brother learning my new name since I'm supposedly just gonna change my mind about transition anyway, and it'll just confuse him. This is why I have doubts as to whether she's really trying with the new name. And to any cis people reading, being deadnamed is a huge slap in the face and it's incredibly disrespectful. I have been trying my best to be patient with her, but I hate how uncomfortable she makes me feel, so I sent her a message to explain how I feel.

I explained in no uncertain terms that if she wants to be a part of my life that the new name is just something she'll have to get used to. I told her that ""as long as you still see me as your son, you might 'love' me but you don't love the real me"", and that one of my biggest fears in transition is that she'll never see me as her daughter, so every time she deadnamed or misgendered me it was a reminder of those fears. It hurts so much because she's my mother and I care about her a lot. I told her that in no way do I expect her to get the name right every time, I just want some reassurance that she's trying, I made a few suggestions for what she could do to practice getting it right. She was deeply hurt by my message, telling me I'm ungrateful for the things she has done (like take me shopping for my birthday). She mentioned how much worse others have it, that I have no idea what it's like to not be accepted, and that I am ""watching too many podcasts"". She told me I can't expect her to just get it right all the time because she's called me by my old name for my whole life, but all I asked of her is that she at least try. On one hand I feel justified, but also I know that my transition is probably hard for her to adjust to, and it's only been months since I picked my name, which is why I worry a bit if I went too far with the message.

TLDR: she deadnames me frequently, I told her how much it hurts me when she does, she was hurt by my message.

3,1fd3m8r,AITA for kicking my parents from my wedding ,"So for context my partner and I have been planning our wedding for about 15 months now. During that time was the dress shopping (both female same sex marriage) 

I invited my mother along to both my fittings and my partner who saw my mother in such high regard also had her come along to hers as well. 
We clearly stipulated that we don't want to see each other in the dresses we choose until the wedding. We don't mind knowing what dress but actually seeing each other in them, and that we would like to have seperate dresses from each other. I thought that's a simple request. The bridal place knew of our request as well.

Through dress fittings I had settled on a dress I love and was encouraged by my mother and chose it as my primary option. At the same time she also encouraged my partner to the same dress knowing our request. The bridal place quietly said to my mother that we were looking at the same dress and to give us a heads up (they did as we asked them) and she brushed them off and told them it's fine.

Now the gaslighting began. When we found out we ordered the same dress we asked for a family meeting. To sit down discuss what happened air grievances etc and put it under the bridge so to speak and move forward. We reiterated we asked fpr this not to happen and was told 3 different stories that conflicted with each other. Told nope that's not what happened, I don't remember that so it didn't happen etc (we had our bridal parties with us so yes we can conform which version of events happened) We were met with severe verbal abuse. And rather sickening derogatory remarks which I can't repeat here (yep that bad). 

After all that ive decided to cut ties with them, told them to leave our lives as we are started new lives together and I don't need this negativity anymore (mother was always like this growing up) told them not to attend the wedding and have told venue to refuse entry to them if they decide to gatecrash.  

All this because we asked a simple request which was ignored and then just asking hey can we have a sit down and talk about what happened.

6,1fd2b20,AITAH for not being there for my daughter?,"When I was 19 I dated a girl for about 3 months. It was a typical teen relationship, lots of hormones, lots of sex. She had a higher sex drive than me in fact.

Long story short, I got a breakup text from her out of the blue one day. A couple days later I found out from a mutual friend that she sent that text as she was jumping into another guy's back seat. They'd apparently been flirting and making out at a party that happened while I was at work and the mutual friend had walked past the car on the way to their own and seen what was going on.

And a week later I got another text from her wanting to get back together. I refused. As far as I was concerned the stunt she'd pulled was no better than cheating and I wasn't interested in someone who'd do me dirty like that. I'm afraid I wasn't nice about it, but I was young, stupid, hurt, and angry. I told her exactly what I thought of her breaking up with me via text while she was making out with another guy.

I never spoke to her again, but I also didn't have her blocked anywhere. She could have contacted me had she chosen to do so, but never did.

Fast forward 20 years. A young lady shows up on my doorstep and introduces herself. She has the same last name as the girl I dated so long ago and a lot of facial features common to my family. She angrily demands to know why I was a deadbeat dad.

After getting over my initial shock I tell her it's because her mother never bothered to tell me she existed. To which she replies that I would have known if I'd ever bothered to reach out.

Apparently her mother had painted me to her as having just walked out of her life for no reason just when she was starting to suspect she was pregnant. I suppose the ""just as she was starting to suspect she was pregnant"" bit might be true, but the ""for no reason"" bit is definitely not.

I let her rant at me because, frankly, what am I going to say to that beyond what I already have. Eventually she seemed to run out of steam as I stood there letting her yell at and just sort of shook her head and stomped off.

She didn't even leave me any way to get in touch with her, so I guess she doesn't want me in her life. But I felt sick over the whole thing.

TL/DR, I've got a daughter I never knew about. AITAH for not ever reaching out to her mother after we broke up?

I'm afraid I wasn't nice about it, but I was young, stupid, hurt, and angry. I told her exactly what I thought of her breaking up with me via text while she was making out with another guy.

I never spoke to her again, but I also didn't have her blocked anywhere. She could have contacted me had she chosen to do so, but never did.

Fast forward 20 years. A young lady shows up on my doorstep and introduces herself. She has the same last name as the girl I dated so long ago and a lot of facial features common to my family. She angrily demands to know why I was a deadbeat dad.

After getting over my initial shock I tell her it's because her mother never bothered to tell me she existed. To which she replies that I would have known if I'd ever bothered to reach out.

Apparently her mother had painted me to her as having just walked out of her life for no reason just when she was starting to suspect she was pregnant. I suppose the ""just as she was starting to suspect she was pregnant"" bit might be true, but the ""for no reason"" bit is definitely not.

I let her rant at me because, frankly, what am I going to say to that beyond what I already have. Eventually she seemed to run out of steam as I stood there letting her yell at and just sort of shook her head and stomped off.

She didn't even leave me any way to get in touch with her, so I guess she doesn't want me in her life. But I felt sick over the whole thing.

TL/DR, I've got a daughter I never knew about. AITAH for not ever reaching out to her mother after we broke up?

  
EDIT: I just reread it and feel the need to clarify one detail: SHE may have been starting to suspect she was pregnant when we broke up, but I had no idea.",0.0,1.055751919746399,1,0
7,1fd1w6a,AITA going on a sibling trip with *newly found sister and not mentioning it?,"I recently went on a trip with my sister (I found out about in 2021 through Ancestry DNA) & our kids. We share a FATHER (he did not know about her whatsoever until 2021). I have a developed relationship with her/her kids. Brother and father, step mom have not. Months before this trip, our dad and step mother were visiting our \*newly found sister\*, apparently a FAMILY trip was mentioned, while my brother or I were not in attendance. NO plan was ever set into motion. And it was never mentioned to me. Outside of that, my sister and I have discussed having a sibling vacay with all 3 siblings. So, we planned one, set the dates and she paid for the AirBnB. 2 weeks before trip, my step mom sent me an Airbnb, with no reference or other text, just the link. I was busy, so I just hit the thumbs up and moved on. 

I don't communicate much with my parents, per them "" learn 85% of my life off Facebook and other 15% from my brother"". I do talk/see brother often. My parents drive an hour to go eat, not an hour and 15 mins to see grandkid. And they expect us to initiate contact. He complains but my brother caters them. He knew about said trip, had been to our parents multiple times. However, he did not mention it, I also did not mention it, and neither did my sister. 

Everything was already booked for SIBLING trip. Our brother was planning to join, did not come after all. Did not stop my sister and I from having the best time! Posting pictures of the scenery, the food. My stepmom was liking all posts, commented on some. I post a pic with us and the kids. Shit hit the fan. Immediately, a comment that said ""well then"" from stepmom. Rolled my eyes to myself and wrote back ""it is not even like that."" She came at me in comments, my friends clapped back. I did not respond. My sister and I continued with our day as planned. FB WENT OFF, and everyone was telling my stepmom ""quit being jealous"", ""no mom would ever."", ""just be happy for them"", etc. I still never replied. About midnight and my sister gets a text. Stepmom, just dogging on me, dragging me through the mud, bringing up old shit. Sis responded she would not continue a relationship if she spoke about me in that way. 

I continued out my vacay without saying anything. I kept getting texts like ""I haven't said anything about the other times you've have gone to see her"", etc. (reference to when I went  for my gpas funeral,  same town my sis lives and she just happened to come see us). So, both my stepmom/dad are pissed at me, say I lied/deceived them.. common courtesy I tell them something was booked.. (I go on trips ALL THE TIME, now it matters?). I did apologize, IDK why. They are good at guilt tripping, I always think I'm wrong somehow. TO ADD THEY ARE ONLY MAD AT ME! They aren't mad at the other 2 siblings!

8,1fd1rxh,AITAH for confronting my friend and ruining the vibe of a trip?,"So I (F31) have a best friend Alex (F29) who has a boyfriend Gene (M29) and so given that, I third wheel almost all the time with her and Gene. Usually this is fine when we're just hanging out or watching a movie but it does get awkward sometimes when they're off talking about an interest that I don't share, or cuddling, or whatever. It's been an issue before of me feeling like a third wheel and like Gene doesn't trust us to hang out alone or something, I don't know. But we've talked through it and things have been okay.

Alex and I went on a four hour trip away to the city to get matching tattoos at a convention this weekend, and Gene came with us. I'd asked if he was coming before, and Alex had said ""Yeah of course I'm not leaving him behind. Why would you ask that?"" Kind of confrontationally. I said that I was afraid that they would go off together during the tattoo convention and leave me alone, which has happened before and is not a thing I wanted for a matching tattoo experience.

They said that of course they wouldn't do that and that they were hurt that I'd even thought that about them. I apologized and we moved on.

Well that's exactly what happened. The tattoo booths were quite small, standing room only, so when Alex got her tattoo, Gene and I made sure to switch off so that someone was always with her.

When my turn came, she sat with me for a bit, talking, which really helped take away the pain of the tattoo for me. Then she went and looked around the convention, which I had no problem with. Then Gene decided that he felt left out and went to pick out his own tattoo and sign all the paperwork, so of course Alex had to be with him for that. By the time she got back mine was over.

I was really upset and told her so, because we'd fucking talked about this. She and Gene both said they didn't know it would be so quick, they didn't want to have a huge wait for Gene to get started on his, etc. I was upset because he could have waited for my turn to be done but he HAD to do it right then and take Alex's attention, and she let him.

I'm aware I sound jealous. I'm aware that there's nothing really to be done. They were apologetic the first night but I think now they've talked it over between themselves in that way couples do and have decided that I'm overreacting. Alex has been acting cold to me since, and turning down invitations and not responding to messages.

10,1fd0y3b,AITA for telling my boyfriend his family are leeches after meeting them for the first time?,"We‚Äôve been dating for about 4 months and last night was the first time I met his family. They were nice at first but I couldn‚Äôt stand the sight of them at the end of the night.

Dinner conversation was normal as they asked about me and my family. Then the table divided into smaller conversation groups and I overheard his older brothers talking to his sister about investing. I‚Äôm not an expert so I‚Äôll give you the gist of what I heard.

She‚Äôs been out of school for a couple of years and have saved up about $75,000 and wants to start investing. They said property is the best and that section 8 is the way to go. They said that the rent is always paid on time and the people won‚Äôt mess up the property because they‚Äôre afraid of getting kicked out of the program. They said the best part is that they‚Äôll still own the properties and the value will always go up. They said they‚Äôre developing a small neighborhood with about 10 houses specifically for section 8. All of those houses under 2000 sqft and have 4 bedrooms as section 8 pays higher rates for more bedrooms and smaller houses are cheaper to maintain. They said that it‚Äôll cost them about $100/sqft to build these houses and the rent will be about $4000 per month. They said that she could buy in on her first rental house next year when they start another development. They‚Äôre in the process of closing on a piece of land that will accommodate about 20 houses.

I cringed then couldn‚Äôt keep quiet anymore. I told them that instead of renting out and keeping those houses off the market, they should sell them to those people. They looked at me quietly and I knew they never considered helping people out by selling the houses they were building. His dad told me I was out of line and I answered that his family was out of line for preying on people in need while feeding off of the taxes people pay. I said that most people can‚Äôt afford to buy a single house yet his sons are building 10-20 at a time which makes them leeches. 

We argued for a bit then we left. This morning my boyfriend told me I need to apologize to his family but I refused to. We just met after my last class and told me we‚Äôre no longer invited to any of his family function including the Christmas trip back to their old country. Since we're still in school, his family was going to pay for us so he really wants me to apologize and smooth things over.

I know I‚Äôm right but maybe I shouldn‚Äôt have been so harsh on the first meeting.

We got his account taken down, but he sent other people to tell us that he thought it was unfair we did, and he apologized, but the apology seemed a little written by AI and I didn‚Äôt forgive him because I felt like I had the right not to. So then he banned one of the other victim‚Äôs (genderfluid, 13) accounts, whom I‚Äôll call L, under the threat to ban us all and make everyone hate us if we didn‚Äôt take it down. L, I, and two other victims however didn‚Äôt take it down, and then he reached out to me as we got another account of his banned and told me I was acting irrationally and unfair, and to be honest I feel kind of guilty because his partners (he‚Äôs poly) have broken up with him over this. So AITA?

15,1fczyby,AITA for storming out after my parents tried to have an intervention?,"I (24 F) stormed out of the house and stayed with my boyfriend for a week after my parents tried to have an intervention. For some context I just recently graduated from college on August 16th and moved back home. I am currently on the job hunt. I have gotten a good amount of interviews but unfortunately the companies have not wanted to move forward. This has been affecting my mental health a lot. But I don‚Äôt allow this to hinder my job search. I have been taking my time since out of college to job search and travel a bit. My dad thinks that I need a job immediately and that I need to stop traveling. My mom has been more lenient but now has been up my butt about getting a job. They both want me to stay home and work part time till I find something. Which is completely fine and I actually have an interview tomorrow for a part time job for the mean time. 

The reason my parents got so upset was because I left to go see my long distance boyfriend. He lives exactly 2 hrs away which is not too bad. During the time I‚Äôm visiting him I spend the majority of my day applying for jobs or doing research for jobs that want to interview me. I don‚Äôt see why this is such a problem because I would be doing the same thing if I stayed at home. My boyfriend is the only one who understands and calms me down when my parents upset me. 

Both my parents were yelling at me before I left saying that I need a job immediately. They threatened to even take my car away. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt want a job which I do very very much. But I just graduated college and I worked all throughout college which was exhausting. My younger sister (22F) who is also in college has never had to work and when she took a gap year she didn‚Äôt work during that time either. 

Storming out during the intervention might have escalated the situation. I know important to address my parents concerns calmly and try to understand their perspective. Their insistence on me finding a job quickly is likely driven by worry and care, even if their approach feels harsh.

I guess I don‚Äôt understand why they are being so tough on me when my sister has done nothing but mooch off my parents and slack in school. Why can‚Äôt they turn their attention on her first? 

I really just wanted to take some time to relax and find a job that fits for me and pays well. Right now I‚Äôm just ready to accept whichever marketing job offers me a position far away from home so I won‚Äôt have to come back. This all has been extremely stressful. Now my mom and dad won‚Äôt talk to me. Im not sure if my actions are reasonable or not.  Please help a girl out.

Recently, one of my friends started dating a woman who already has a son, about 11 years old. So far, so good. The problem is that his girlfriend started wanting to show up at our gatherings with the boy. My friend had talked to me about the possibility and I said it wouldn't be cool to bring him to my house, where most of our meetups happen, because I have a nice, big common area and since I don't have kids, everyone is an adult and we just have adult conversations. He seemed to understand and I thought that was the end of it.

I scheduled a get-together to celebrate my birthday in May. We were all going to a restaurant and then to my house to hang out. Imagine my surprise when my friend showed up with the boy! I was kind of speechless, but I thought 'well, it's a public place, I can't control who goes to the restaurant, right? Maybe the mom will come pick him up after lunch.' Wrong. They brought the boy to my house and he stayed there all afternoon.

The rest of my friends arrived and commented that they thought it was ""super inappropriate"" for them to bring the boy when I said I didn't want to. Everyone was a bit uncomfortable. I didn't say anything to my friend or his girlfriend, I wanted to enjoy my day as much as possible.

Cut to now, this girlfriend with a child sent me a message asking to use my common area to celebrate her birthday. I've ALWAYS been super open to celebrating my friends's b-days on my house before but that's really not the case is it? I'm still speechless reading the message. I honestly am not up to it I mean... If she felt entitled to bring her son to my birthday, without respecting my request, imagine what might happen at her party? I'm afraid she might invite other people besides us, even if she said it would be a more intimate event.

They have their own apartment, in the city, about 10 minutes drive, which sits vacant, as they prefer to live on the acreage..
I only have one sister, and her and I are not close. She's always been my father's favorite and never missed a chance of making him angry at me, or to kick me when i was down.. My father is been abusive (both verbally and physically) my entire life. She's now verbally abusive herself.
My mom is codependent and the more I look into her actions the more I see Livia Soprano.
Yes, it's a pretty dysfunctional family, however, looking from the outside, we look like the perfect family, as my parents do everything to keep the perfect image.
They helped my sister and her husband buy their apartment and vehicles, and my niece is been spending all her vacations at my acreage, as she prefers it to her other grandma's apartment in the city.

Because they connected gas snd water (which my parents use) and my property increased in value.
The increase is very marginal, as the water and gas were brought by the city at the property line.
Not to mention, our parents are very much much alive, and healthy, hopefully will live another 20 years...
I recently found our that my sister is now getting divorced, and, a cpl years ago, my parents gave her and her husband, their entire savings, to buy a second apartment, to have ""for their granddaughter ""(my niece).
My niece is 13, an only child, my wife and I have 4 children, our youngest one is autistic, and, we've been paying a lot of interest on loans and mortgage over the past 16 years when I could've sold the acreage and pay off some debt.
I am of course very hurt yo find out that they gave her almost $60,000 and didn't told me anything about it, or didn't split it to give half to our kids.

After learning about my sister's divorce, and my parents actually blaming my now ex-BIL for my sister's cheating!? basically she's a saint that walks on water while my father never misses a chance to humiliate, berate or belittle me, I decided I finally had enough and is time to look after my own interests.

I decided to sell the acreage and have my parents move back to their apartment,  although I know that their quality of life won't be the same.
My sister has cut off my parents completely (after my dad and her had some words about her divorce and cheating), and there's no way they can pay them back, so my parents will be struggling financially in their old age without the extra income the land provides them.

22,1fcz6se,AITA for hinting to my customer that she is a bad mom ,"I'm a 17-year-old female, and I used to work at our local Subway. It was usually quiet, so only one person worked each shift.

This story happened during one of my evening shifts, when I was working alone. It‚Äôs common for smaller locations like ours to have a sign at the front saying the ""sandwich artist"" is on break and will be back shortly. From the break room, there are cameras that show the front, and I saw a couple with their kid (the parents were around 40, and the kid about 8) standing there looking at the sign. They kept waiting, which was unusual‚Äîmost people just go to McDonald's nearby. Feeling bad, I decided to quickly make their sandwich.

The woman asked for gluten-free bread. I internally groaned because gluten-free bread is tricky‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to balance, takes longer to heat, and is more difficult to work with. I grabbed the bread, and she asked for a recommendation. I suggested the BMT, but she asked for taco beef instead. No problem‚ÄîI made the sandwich and put it in the oven.

While the bread was heating, the kid started pulling on the glass, yelling, ‚ÄúCAN WE GET A FREE DRINK? MOMMY SAID WE COULD!‚Äù When the bread came out, the cheese had fallen off (which is common with gluten-free bread), so I offered to add extra cheese for free. She then asked, ‚ÄúCan you add more meat too?‚Äù Confused, since no meat had fallen off, I still obliged.

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-09,"AITA for hinting to my customer that she is a bad mom  I'm a 17-year-old female, and I used to work at our local Subway. It was usually quiet, so only one person worked each shift.

This story happened during one of my evening shifts, when I was working alone. It‚Äôs common for smaller locations like ours to have a sign at the front saying the ""sandwich artist"" is on break and will be back shortly. From the break room, there are cameras that show the front, and I saw a couple with their kid (the parents were around 40, and the kid about 8) standing there looking at the sign. They kept waiting, which was unusual‚Äîmost people just go to McDonald's nearby. Feeling bad, I decided to quickly make their sandwich.

The woman asked for gluten-free bread. I internally groaned because gluten-free bread is tricky‚Äîit‚Äôs hard to balance, takes longer to heat, and is more difficult to work with. I grabbed the bread, and she asked for a recommendation. I suggested the BMT, but she asked for taco beef instead. No problem‚ÄîI made the sandwich and put it in the oven.

While the bread was heating, the kid started pulling on the glass, yelling, ‚ÄúCAN WE GET A FREE DRINK? MOMMY SAID WE COULD!‚Äù When the bread came out, the cheese had fallen off (which is common with gluten-free bread), so I offered to add extra cheese for free. She then asked, ‚ÄúCan you add more meat too?‚Äù Confused, since no meat had fallen off, I still obliged.

When I asked what vegetables she wanted, she said, ‚ÄúAll of them.‚Äù I cringed because gluten-free bread is hard to close. As I added lettuce, she complained, ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt there be more?‚Äù I explained, ‚ÄúSince you asked for all the veggies, I‚Äôm seeing how much fits.‚Äù She scoffed and mumbled something to her husband.

All of us were very close friends the past 3 years. However, things started falling apart when I moved in. Callie pulled me aside and told me that Emma was talking about me behind my back while she was studying abroad. I also kept getting hit with small passive aggressive messages from Callie, which she had never done before.

In the summer, everyone left to go back home except Anna, who agreed to take care of my cat since she was staying in town. 

We had this cat because she used to be with my parents, but in recent years one of the other cats bullied her, making her anxious and need special care. I brought up the idea of having her with us during the school year and we were all on board. I took care of all the deposits and fees with our landlord (they never needed to pay), and she lived with us. My boyfriend Jake would also stay over a lot, which was okay with everyone. Because he was so close with her, I asked him if he could take care of her over the summer when Anna wasn‚Äôt there. I ran this by everyone and they were all cool with the arrangement, especially Anna, so I gave Jake my house key. 
One day, he was going into the house, and Beth saw he had a key and told Callie. She then angrily messaged me, saying I went behind their backs and that I‚Äôm a horrible friend. She said while it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot personal,‚Äù she felt very uncomfortable with Jake having a key to the house. I reminded her that she‚Äôs known my boyfriend for over a year from when we lived together before, and he‚Äôs been nothing but considerate when he‚Äôs over, so how is it not personal? I also reminded her the only reason he had my key was to take care of the cat.

Jake reached out to Callie to ask why she didn‚Äôt trust him. She kept avoiding the question by saying ‚Äúit isn‚Äôt personal,‚Äù and it got heated from there. Callie later said she was being attacked by Jake, which confused me because she started this whole thing by name-calling before we even had a chance to talk. Jake also showed me their conversation, and it didn‚Äôt seem like there was anything aggressive about it. Callie‚Äôs new boyfriend also decided to involve himself and sent Jake mean things about me, like ‚Äúif she can‚Äôt take care of a cat she shouldn‚Äôt have one.‚Äù I‚Äôm not sure why he felt the need to do this when I had talked to him very little. 

In the end, Callie and I both expressed disappointment in each other‚Äôs boyfriends, and we left it at that.

Recently, during a family gathering, we were talking about our old family cat. This cat has been dead for 12 years. She has never met this cat and I don't even think she has seen a picture of her.  The conversation was lighthearted, with us sharing fond memories of the cat, mostly about how dumb she was ( she was an orange cat and had a single brain cell). Out of nowhere, my DIL started crying and talking about how she how sad it was that the car is dead. She got really emotional, and the whole conversation shifted to comforting her. People were either trying to get her to calm down and standing around confused/uncomfortable. 


This has happens beofre and I multiple people have brought it up. Usally she ends up crying and my son is very overprotective of her at this point. I think she has cried at almost every event.

In the moment, I was frustrated and said, ‚ÄúOMG, not everything is about you, you didn't even know the cat‚Äù.

My son (35M) and she have been married for five years, and while I‚Äôve tried to get along with her, this habit is becoming harder to deal with.

Recently, during a family gathering, we were talking about our old family cat. This cat has been dead for 12 years. She has never met this cat and I don't even think she has seen a picture of her.  The conversation was lighthearted, with us sharing fond memories of the cat, mostly about how dumb she was ( she was an orange cat and had a single brain cell). Out of nowhere, my DIL started crying and talking about how she how sad it was that the car is dead. She got really emotional, and the whole conversation shifted to comforting her. People were either trying to get her to calm down and standing around confused/uncomfortable. 


This has happens beofre and I multiple people have brought it up. Usally she ends up crying and my son is very overprotective of her at this point. I think she has cried at almost every event.

In the moment, I was frustrated and said, ‚ÄúOMG, not everything is about you, you didn't even know the cat‚Äù. My son immediately got defensive and told me I was being insensitive and she started crying harder, and now both of them are upset with me. My son think I was a jerk and need to apologize. 

AITA for saying that when she got emotional over a cat?",0.0,1.0609756708145142,1,0
29,1fcxw26,AITA for riding my bike in the road,"This is at a large university. There is one short road that is about 1/4th of a mile long and a bike path that is a sidewalk about 10 feet from the road and a bike path with a large sidewalk as well about 50 feet from the road. I often take this road because my bike is parked right next to the road and it is often faster to travel on the road then to get to the bike path and travel only a short distance. Also I normally go the speed limit (25) I travel around 22-23 mph on this road and if any car catches me then we would generally be within 200 feet of the stop sign in which everyone should be slowing down anyway so it doesn't affect other cars. 

Today, however, it was super windy and I didn't expect that, so I hopped on the road as I normally do but half way in the road the wind was just causing me to go sluggish. I checked behind me and luckily no cars but there is a turn onto this road that is 400 feet from the stop sign at the end of the road. There was a car that turned out and had to follow me for 400 feet until I could get off the road and back onto the sidewalk to continue the path (at this sidewalk the bike path and all other sidewalks meet into one intersection) (this is where I hop on the bike path). He followed me for 400 feet on my butt and then yelled at me, ""There is a bike path for a reason buddy."" I felt a little bad since I was holding him up and this is written from my perspective. Thus, from his perspective he is following a slow biker holding up the road when there is a bike path that is to the right of the road.

So it is on my mind of whether I was kind of in the wrong. There wasn't much I could've done as I didn't know it would be that windy today, and I also didn't see him until we were practically at the stop sign because the distance is short. I have taken measures to prevent this from happening again on other windy days though (my tires were a bit flat which only hurt, otherwise I should be fine). I guess the main issue is that I didn't see him pull out and get behind me otherwise I would've tried to speed up to the speed limit... I don't know.

30,1fcxtrp,AITA for not forgiving my sister who is a recovering alcoholic?,"My (29F) older sister (32F) struggled with alcohol dependency starting in her 20's. It started after she had her son, who is now 7, and she has severe post partum depression. We did not live in the same state at this time and I tried to be supportive as much as I could as a freshly graduated 22 year old barely scraping by.

She has gone through many ups and downs in the last 7 years, including getting divorced because of her habits and her ex-husband getting sole custody of their son. She has attempted some recovery centers, but never stayed more than a week. A few years ago, she started dating around with random men, moving around city to city like every 3 months, hardly speaking to family at all, including her son.

During this time, she constantly asked me for money. I hardly ever had any to give, and when I did I made it I paid it directly to a rent portal, or car payment site or what have you. But most of the time I did not have money to give her and she would call me *horrible* names and tell me that I was a worthless sister/person. She got her random boyfriends to reach out to me for money and then they would harass me as well. She even once told a man she was with that I would sleep with him, too.

When I was 26 she called me from an airport 3 states away and asked me to come get her. I told her that I had no way to do that but I would send her money for an uber. This lead to her berating me over the phone about how she never wanted to speak to me again and how her addiction was entirely my fault for not being a better sister.

A while ago, she checked herself into a really great program, and has been sober for about 1.5 years. Yes, I am incredibly proud of her and I love her. She is doing very well for herself and has moved to the same city as her son and has every other weekend with him. Everything I learn about her has been through our parents or her ex.

She reached out to me last week, asking if I wanted to come fly in to see her and my nephew (who I have kept in contact with through her ex husband, but I have not seen him a lot since I do not live close). I was shocked to hear from her. She has not acknowledged her behavior towards me at all, just called me and started chatting like none of the horrible things she said ever happened.

My parents told me that it is my responsibility to forgive and forget and help her move on from her dependency as well. But I don't know. I am genuinely extremely hurt by all of the things she said. I've never been in this situation and don't know what the ""proper"" thing is to do, but as of right now I do not want to talk her.

AITA for not forgiving her?

Edit: 

Thanks to everyone for their comments, they really meant a lot to me. I was feeling very lost and overwhelmed in this situation, and the comments and advice definitely helped. My partner and my closest friends are adamant that I stay away until she gets further in her healing journey, but as I said my parents are really wanting to put this behind them and keep encouraging me to reach out to my sister. Plus, I have a lot of internal conflict because she is my sister, my only sibling. We were very close before everything. 

My parents were also invited to spend time with my sister and nephew, and the comments help me realized that there is a chance my sister wants to make amends in person, which I do feel I should at least honor that and see what happens. I have no idea how I will feel about it after. 

I talked at length with my partner last night after we read through some of your comments and we decided he'd come with me and we'd stay in a hotel, as opposed to the guest room she initially offered me. 

Lastly, thank you so much for the Al-anon advice. I don't know why I never thought to look for something like that. I am going to encourage my parents to try it as well.

From there, our relationship began to heal, and she became an amazing grandma.

After a breakup with my child‚Äôs mother, I asked my mom to move to the state where I live to help me out. She agreed, and I helped her move in. But five months later, when my grandmother got sick, my mom left to go back and be with her, leaving me behind.

33,1fcxp86,AITA - siblings-in-law and families not taking,"Hello all. Cheeky little throw-away.

I've been with my partner for around 13 years and lived with them for around 10 years. I moved across our country to do this so I'm so glad we have a solid relationship. 

My husband is quite successful in his line of work. I also work full time. We don't make loads of money but we're comfortable and have a mortgage that we're chipping away at. 

My husband has two younger siblings in their 30s. I love them like my own siblings. They both still live at home and work at the family business and always have done. They don't have much going on socially; neither are in relationships and pay a small amount to the house upkeep. They smoke a lot of weed but are pretty well behaved by all accounts. I'm not sure they're planning on moving out. They seem pretty comfy with no one bothering them to move. 

Anyway, we recently discovered that my husband's parents are planning on leaving the house to my husband's siblings, and not including him. The siblings told us this, rather off handedly and without much ceremony.

This came as a bit of a shock to me as I was unaware that they'd even made a decision. We host regular family BBQs and have recently looked after an ill family member. I thought we were an important part of the family. To have been left out of future planning has just left me feeling a bit funky. 

My husband has emotionally detached himself from the situation but I find myself annoyed on his behalf. He told me it's really not our business and that I shouldn't worry about it. His parents have always held him to a higher standard than his siblings so I think he's used to it? I've encouraged him to speak with his parents for clarification about their wishes. He said he'd think about it. 

AITA for feeling things about this? I know it's their house but being left out of the whole conversation just feels weird to me...like, maybe like they were trying to avoid upsetting my husband. I am from a very open family so all these half-conversations has left me somewhat befuddled. ü´£ü§î

34,1fcxlwt,AITA: I told my bro he could live with me and my bf until Feb and now I‚Äôm going to ask him to stay with our parents,"Hi everyone, I (34 m) recently allowed my brother (31) to live with me and my boyfriend (27 m), which I now realize was an awful mistake. I just bought my first house a few months ago and we moved out from the city. Soon after that, my younger brother - who is constantly changing career paths - reached out and asked if he could move across the country and stay with us for a while. He said he was quitting his job and planned on moving to Japan in February. 

He said he was taking a new job in the meantime which required a lot of travel and that he‚Äôd be gone most of the time (and planned to quit that one too before moving to pursue his job as a chef). That job fell through so he said he was going to commute to the city most days to work as a line cook at a restaurant (mind you, he has a PHD). He quit after 3 days saying it was too stressful (I‚Äôm like, and you want to be a chef???). 

I had originally said he could live here for free to save money and he thanked me saying I was doing him a huge favor. So since he‚Äôs been here for a month and a half, he has barely left the house. He is constantly cooking in the kitchen messing things up (not exaggerating - it‚Äôs all day every day while me and my bf wfh when I‚Äôm not traveling for work). He makes so much noise while we are on business calls which I‚Äôve told him to please stop. He has destroyed two of my rugs - got red sauce all over one and then bleached one after dying his hair and just left it there). I have zero time to spend with my bf who I‚Äôve been with for almost two years. We‚Äôre at a crucial point in our relationship. I want to propose at some point, but I feel like we‚Äôre not building our relationship as we should be because my brother is ALWAYS around.

I‚Äôm pretty much at my wits end now and thinking about asking him to leave to our parents who are a few hours away. He said he‚Äôs taking a new remote job which means he‚Äôll be here constantly still and now says he‚Äôd like to leave to Japan in May which is not what we agreed to. I‚Äôm asking for advice because before he moved in, I considered my brother one of my best friends. Now, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in him. I‚Äôve realized he‚Äôs a man child who can‚Äôt commit to a job, doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself. I know this is going to really damage our relationship if I tell him he to leave, but I feel like I have no choice. My bf is appalled at his behavior too. We said as long as he pays for his own things I‚Äôm he could live here, but he eats our food, uses our laundry detergent, coffee pods, etc. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated. I feel like he‚Äôs depressed or not thinking clearly. My parents said they were less worried about him now that he‚Äôs living with me which is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt asked him to leave.

He said he‚Äôs taking a new remote job which means he‚Äôll be here constantly still and now says he‚Äôd like to leave to Japan in May which is not what we agreed to. I‚Äôm asking for advice because before he moved in, I considered my brother one of my best friends. Now, I‚Äôm extremely disappointed in him. I‚Äôve realized he‚Äôs a man child who can‚Äôt commit to a job, doesn‚Äôt clean up after himself. I know this is going to really damage our relationship if I tell him he to leave, but I feel like I have no choice. My bf is appalled at his behavior too. We said as long as he pays for his own things I‚Äôm he could live here, but he eats our food, uses our laundry detergent, coffee pods, etc. 

Any advice on how to approach this would be appreciated. I feel like he‚Äôs depressed or not thinking clearly. My parents said they were less worried about him now that he‚Äôs living with me which is one of the reasons I haven‚Äôt asked him to leave. But between my new house, relationship with bf and me personally starting a new job a month and a half ago, this is just too much. As I write this he just shattered a dish in my kitchen.",0.0,0.1286412477493286,0,1

I‚Äôve gently tried to tell her that, as much as I think it‚Äôs great that she is unmasking but I also need to be able to talk and communicate within meetings to prevent them dragging on with me repeating: meeting lengths have also been a problem she has raised.

Recently, my mother was diagnosed with a brain tumor, and when they removed it, she went blind.

I've tried countless systems but she gets angry with me and says she needs to know what each medication is or she won't take them.

43,1fcvpo6,AITAH to not allow my mom in the hospital when I give birth? ,"


So I have a long history with my mother. She was never there for me as a child. 

She is *extremely* delusional and a professional victim. I tried to mend things with her but it went no where. So I ended up cutting her off again. I am due within the next two weeks and this is the message that she sent my husband. Mind you they have only met maybe 2 times. 

‚ÄúHi DH, I hope everything is well with you, OP and GS. I truly miss all of you. OP‚Äôs dad told me that the baby is due this month. I was shocked because the last time OP talked to me she wasn't sure if she was even pregnant. OP has chosen to not like me based on untrue beliefs.
She never gave me a chance to talk. I don't want to miss the birth of my grandchild as I already missed one. Can you please ask her if I could be there. I can't tell you how much it hurts to be a grandparent and not be able to see your grandchildren. It also hurts very much when your own child doesn't like you. It's the worst feeling in the world. Life is too short to miss out on being with family. I was so happy to see OP and then she left again. If she's angry with me she should give me a chance to talk it over with her. I miss GS smiling face and don't want to miss both children growing up. I will always love OP because she is my daughter. That's what parents do.‚Äù 

I literally told her I was pregnant and she told me ‚ÄúI hope not‚Äù. Not only that she‚Äôs never told me she loved me. We don‚Äôt say that to each other and aren‚Äôt going to magically say it now.

So I have a long history with my mother. She was never there for me as a child. 

She is *extremely* delusional and a professional victim. I tried to mend things with her but it went no where. So I ended up cutting her off again. I am due within the next two weeks and this is the message that she sent my husband. Mind you they have only met maybe 2 times. 

‚ÄúHi DH, I hope everything is well with you, OP and GS. I truly miss all of you. OP‚Äôs dad told me that the baby is due this month. I was shocked because the last time OP talked to me she wasn't sure if she was even pregnant. OP has chosen to not like me based on untrue beliefs.
She never gave me a chance to talk. I don't want to miss the birth of my grandchild as I already missed one. Can you please ask her if I could be there. I can't tell you how much it hurts to be a grandparent and not be able to see your grandchildren. It also hurts very much when your own child doesn't like you. It's the worst feeling in the world. Life is too short to miss out on being with family. I was so happy to see OP and then she left again. If she's angry with me she should give me a chance to talk it over with her. I miss GS smiling face and don't want to miss both children growing up. I will always love OP because she is my daughter. That's what parents do.‚Äù 

I literally told her I was pregnant and she told me ‚ÄúI hope not‚Äù. Not only that she‚Äôs never told me she loved me. We don‚Äôt say that to each other and aren‚Äôt going to magically say it now.

We decided to Uber there since parking would be more expensive. When I saw Hannah she was clearly stoned and she admitted she had chugged a large beer earlier. 
For backstory, Hannah admits she is an alcoholic and cannot handle being sober. The day earlier she said she‚Äôs been good about not drinking lately and doesn‚Äôt even want to get super drunk anymore, so I trusted that she could handle herself.

We then head into the convention and of course, there‚Äôs a bar there‚Ä¶ Hannah then heads straight to it to grab a white claw and gets upset at me for not wanting to drink one with her. Later on she goes back to get another and the bartender gave her a free shot. Towards the end of our time there, she wanders off again and then comes back (no white claw in hand) but admits the bartender just gave her 3 more free shots.. I‚Äôm honestly so over it at this point because she is clearly very drunk and calling me a dumb bitch for not drinking with her. She‚Äôs also constantly accusing me of having her phone and wallet even tho they were both in her hand.. We leave the building and call an Uber.

So for some context, I'm in a relationship with my boyfriend (23,M) for 5 years now. The relationship started off when we were physically able to be with each other but due to some circumstances we're currently long distance. There had been many issues with communication especially with how to do it properly, it has always been a hassle to deal with given that the only way to settle things was through video chats and call. It's honestly draining. 

So today i was not having  a great day, there was a supply issue that hindered my tasks where eventually  it got piled up one after another. (I'm holding back on information because he's active on Reddit and I'm worried he'd find out about this.) Just to summarize it, It was  hot, I was sweaty and everything smells in my house and I can't even do anything but to just sit there and wait. It got me frustrated and grumpy all day. 

As this was going on I keep my boyfriend updated on things. Telling him about the issue and how I'm grumpy and sad I was about it. He's  attending university so I waited  (like I usually do) for him to go home so I can rant and tell him about my day. 

When he got home, he video called me and everything was okay at first. I told him how my day went and how frustrated I was. So what went wrong was, I expected that he'd give me attention and comfort. I know it sounds crazy to be so frustrated with the inconvenience I had (Please do tell me if I'm  crazy, I'm that desperate to know what went wrong)  but maybe just a little ""it's okay, babe"" will do perfectly fine by me.

At one point he stopped talking altogether and told me that he's online shopping (while were on vc), and I was kind of disappointed with that. So my frustration with our current conversation isn't really helping with anything so i told him that I was expecting him to at least cheer me up. 

He told me he was sorry he couldn't cheer me up because he wasn't just up for it. He has plans for the night and he's just not up to deal with anything ""heavy"". He told me that he experienced minor inconveniences too but doesn't involve me in it. He told me about how frustrating his day was too. How he tried to see things positively instead of being frustrated by it. And now he's upset with me and telling me he's not in the mood to work with his tasks anymore because I messed his mood up. 

I tried to communicate with him that he can just tell me if he's not feeling like dealing with me, then I can maybe just not say those things. But then he hung up on me. So idk anymore I'm just extra frustrated now. 

I think maybe he thinks that I'm relying on him emotionally too much.

60,1fcpljl,AITAH for telling my girlfriends mother about her substance abuse?,"Me (23m) and my girlfiend (20f) have been dating for around 8 months, we did know eachother for about a year or so beforehand and I knew she had issues prior to us dating. While I knew she liked to dabble in substances while clubbing and at events, she was never doing them outside of these events and she wasn't going to these events hardly ever since we started dating.
She is still recovering heavily from previous issues meaning she is 5foot 2 inches tall and 38kg so she is severely underweight (which is relevant to the story).
So we were on the phone planning things to do and talking about our upcoming plans and I mentioned to her that the one we have booked I would rather her not do drugs while there because it is a huge setback whenever she does this like she will be bedbound for days on end and won't eat for the next couple of days, I understand there is more underlying issues to this and this is the reason I would rather her not do them. I gave her the ultimatum that if she wants to do drugs at the music event we have (bassline and anb music which attracts a lot of this) then would not be attending.
After I said this it led to a huge argument that got blown way out of proportion and she was screaming down the phone and hung up.
I didn't speak to her for the rest of the day and the next day went over to her house to make amends though I was caught off guard when her mother confronted me and asked why I wouldn't let her daughter (my girlfriend) drink alcohol. I was pissed off at this as I didn't want her mother thinking I'm being controlling because I want the best for my gf and don't want her damaging herself and was also annoyed that my girlfriend lied to her mother to get out of her situatic and make me look the bad guy so I told her what tr V real deal was.
This caused a huge uproar in the house and now my girlfriend is blaming me for causing this when I was just trying to defend myself and not look like a controlling boyfriend.

While I knew she liked to dabble in substances while clubbing and at events, she was never doing them outside of these events and she wasn't going to these events hardly ever since we started dating.
She is still recovering heavily from previous issues meaning she is 5foot 2 inches tall and 38kg so she is severely underweight (which is relevant to the story).
So we were on the phone planning things to do and talking about our upcoming plans and I mentioned to her that the one we have booked I would rather her not do drugs while there because it is a huge setback whenever she does this like she will be bedbound for days on end and won't eat for the next couple of days, I understand there is more underlying issues to this and this is the reason I would rather her not do them. I gave her the ultimatum that if she wants to do drugs at the music event we have (bassline and anb music which attracts a lot of this) then would not be attending.
After I said this it led to a huge argument that got blown way out of proportion and she was screaming down the phone and hung up.
I didn't speak to her for the rest of the day and the next day went over to her house to make amends though I was caught off guard when her mother confronted me and asked why I wouldn't let her daughter (my girlfriend) drink alcohol. I was pissed off at this as I didn't want her mother thinking I'm being controlling because I want the best for my gf and don't want her damaging herself and was also annoyed that my girlfriend lied to her mother to get out of her situatic and make me look the bad guy so I told her what tr V real deal was.
This caused a huge uproar in the house and now my girlfriend is blaming me for causing this when I was just trying to defend myself and not look like a controlling boyfriend.

61,1fcph7j,AITA for refusing to lift my mom?,"AITA for refusing to lift my mom?

Not sure where to start so I‚Äôll just go for it. 

My mom is terminally ill and paralyzed so cannot do anything for herself. This includes absolutely everything so to get in and out of bed she needs to be lifted for example. 

We currently have not one but 2 cranes for lifting patients in the household which my mother refuses to use at all costs. My mother has aid workers that have always done the lifting but currently there are only 2 women who are not willing to lift manually (understandably). 
The women were recently hired to switch the previous workers and the agreement was my mom would use the crane to be lifted. 

Backing up a bit - about 6 months ago I started having extreme pain in my back and leg to the point I couldn‚Äôt walk for several weeks, then I was diagnosed a herniated disc and sciatica. There were periods on and off where I would often need to manually lift my mom when workers were being replaced etc so it is completely possible the herniated disc was caused by that. I obviously updated my family about my back and said I would no longer be able to lift my mom for the foreseeable future due to the injury and everyone was understanding.

All of a sudden my mom is saying part of the reason she doesn‚Äôt use the crane is because the seat isn‚Äôt comfortable which was never mentioned before. We are ordering a different seat but by the time it comes will be days that someone needs to lift her. I have been asked to do the lifting and did it multiple times yesterday and today and my back is starting to feel it. 

I told my mom that it‚Äôs not ok she put me in this position and we‚Äôve asked her and agreed to use the crane and knowing the issues with my back is still insisting I lift her.

62,1fcpdd9,AITA for dropping out of my friend‚Äôs wedding party 3 weeks before her wedding?,"title. My friend F (31) and I (32) have been friends for about 8 years when we met in grad school. When she asked me to be part of her bridal party earlier this year I was quite happy! There were a few times when I had fallen into pretty deep depression over the past few years and didn‚Äôt keep in contact with any of my friends, so it was nice to know she still wanted me there.

The problem is, as the summer started my friend basically stopped contacting me except through our wedding group chat and barely checked in with me at all. We had one or two text exchanges over the past few months but that‚Äôs about it. I know she was busy with wedding planning but she didn‚Äôt respond to my text about getting a new job until about a week after I sent it in the group chat and she barely asked to hang out. I stopped reaching out to her a few months ago to see if she actually cared enough to reach out to me and heard zilch from her. 

Everything came to a head this week when she made plans for drinks. She was dropping off my bridesmaid dress and I just couldn‚Äôt take it anymore, I started explaining how I didn‚Äôt feel connected to her and that she hasn‚Äôt been reaching out enough to feel like a real friend especially for someone in her bridal party. I barely know what‚Äôs going on in her life and she barely knows what‚Äôs going on in mine, and I didn‚Äôt feel close enough to her to be part of her wedding party anymore. She started crying and saying she was struggling a lot with work and depression. I can definitely relate but as she was talking I realized I really didn‚Äôt feel that close with her or that I valued the friendship that much. I ended up leaving and after thinking for a few days sent her a text that I didn‚Äôt think the friendship could continue given the way she acted and that I really just wasn‚Äôt that close to her. Two of my friends are pissed that I ended the friendship so close to her wedding and asked why I couldn‚Äôt have waited a few weeks and then talked to her, but I honestly had no idea how I‚Äôd show up for her on her wedding day after she dropped me this summer.

EDIT: I should clarify this post makes me sound worse than I am. Really after she dropped me I realized we didn‚Äôt have much in common and weren‚Äôt very close at all, if she had asked me right then to be in her bridal party I would have said no.

64,1fcovrt,AITA for not being able to move my friend out of the way when a steel beam nearly fell onto us?,"I need advice since I've fallen out with a friend and I feel really bad. I only use Reddit for tech help or to find niche stuff like movies but here goes. Last week, on Thursday I was going to university and something bad happened. But to understand, here is some back story. I take a train and then a bus to get to my university, but recently I haven't taken the bus since it is unreliable and never comes on time. So, I just walk. It's a good thing too because road work and construction have popped up on the route the Bus takes and it won't be completed for a long while.  Sometimes my friends join me on my walk to school, there are three of them. But one of the three rarely walks. Amma is the one who doesn't like to walk. She's kinda on the heavier side. I'm not exactly the slimmest and neither are my other two friends, but Amma is definitely the heaviest. No big deal tho, it doesn't get in the way of anything. Now you have backstory let me tell you what happened. Last Thursday, I got off at the train station and made my way to the traffic light across the street. I began walking and a few minutes later I heard someone call my name, it was Amma. I stopped so we could walk together and talk. We began to talk, and she told me she couldn't take the bus today because of the construction. I offered to walk with her until the buses could return to their usual route. As we were walking we passed the construction area that buses can't go through but people can. We were laughing when we heard a couple of tradies yelling at us from a few stories above to move and get out of the way. I was the first to look up and I saw one of those steel beam things falling in our direction. I got scared and I yanked Amma by her backpack but it was a little hard to move her since she is a bit heavy and I think she was paralyzed with fear.  I tried a few more times, but she didn't budge and the beam fell. Luckily it wasn't anywhere close to us and the tradies had been off about their assessment of the beam falling on us, still, the area was closed off and we had to find a new route to walk. Me and Amma were a bit shaken up but we got to class safely. I walked her to her class and told her to meet at the entrance of the campus at the end of the day so we could figure out a new route to walk. She didn't meet me at the end of the day and I had to walk to the train station alone. When I got home, Amma texted me. I thought it would be a reel or message about how crazy what had happened in the morning was but instead, it was a message about how bad I had made her feel for being overweight and how I wasn't pulling hard enough. She waited for me to see the message before she blocked me and I couldn't respond. I started to panic and I felt guilty. I've tried to get in contact with her but she's blocked me on everything.

65,1fcnqw7,AITA for telling someone negative emotions are valid but shouldn‚Äôt influence how you react and behave?,"I (27F) have been friends with a girl from school since we were six. Our friendship had ups and downs, including periods where we didn't talk for months. My friend (also 27F) had a troubled childhood, and while the rest of our friend group (four girls) also experienced trauma, it helped us bond.

After drifting apart for a few years due to our own lives, we reconnected in 2019. Initially, I was happy to support her as she was dealing with a lot of issues, but over time, it felt like she expected more and more from me, and would get upset when I couldn‚Äôt meet her expectations. For instance, after spending a few days at my place, she invited me over multiple times, but I was busy. She took my inability to visit personally, feeling that I wasn‚Äôt putting in as much effort as she was. I understood where she was coming from but wasn‚Äôt emotionally equipped to handle it, so I suggested we take a break from talking.

A few days ago, she reached out and mentioned she'd be visiting my city (we now live in different countries). I agreed to meet her, and while it was nice seeing her after so long, it became clear that she hadn‚Äôt moved on from a lot of past issues. 

While we were at a caf√©, the owners generously offered us a free croissant and coffee since it was near the end of the day. I thanked them, but my friend whispered that we should leave instead of accepting the free food. She expressed distrust, suggesting the owners might be stalling us. I was confused because we could clearly see the croissant being warmed. She kept insisting, and I eventually told her to calm down, assuring her we'd leave once the food was ready.

A bit after that she started talking about how her past trauma has given her trust issues and made life difficult for her. I empathized, sharing that I had also experienced PTSD and had gone through therapy, which helped me process my emotions without letting them control me. I explained that while it's important to feel emotions, it‚Äôs also crucial not to let them dominate how you think or act.

This upset her. She said she‚Äôs always been emotional and holds onto how people make her feel, something her parents did as well. I tried to clarify that emotions are valid, but they shouldn‚Äôt stop her from living her best life. However, she became visibly upset and told me our views don‚Äôt align because our lives are different. She said she‚Äôll always prioritize her emotions when responding to situations and will surround herself with people who understand that.

This was 10 years ago. He met a few women before his wife of 9 years. They were together a few months before they got married and she was pregnant right away. Dad said he knew she was the one. He was finally in love. That mom was his biggest regret in life. My sister would cry which annoyed dad. He'd say we should want him to be happy when he sacrificed his own happiness for us.

He's a better dad to the kids he has with his wife. He's there on their birthdays, remembers to buy them gifts, takes them out for ice cream, or for special time with him. He comes home earlier to spend time with them before they go to bed and helps with their homework. He never did that with us even after he started changing. My sister and brother really wanted him to for the longest time. But I always knew he was a shit parent and that he wasn't going to change toward us. We always fought. He told me the three of us were born selfish. That we wanted him to be unhappy for our sakes. I told him he basically dumped his issues onto three grieving kids and didn't give a fuck about what that did to us. I reminded him that my brother was only 4 years old when we lost mom. Dad's response was that if I cared so much about them, I should care even more about my younger half siblings. I told him I didn't. I have told him that a few times since my first half sibling was born. In truth I never spend any time with the halfs or engage with them. It's me and my brother and sister and I put my time and love into them.

My siblings have reached out to dad and asked for him to love them and spend time with them but his focus is on the family he wants, his favorite family as I think of them. I don't think of them as mine.

Dad's wife and one of his favorite kids had birthdays a day apart. His gift for one was delayed/late or whatever and he wasn't going to pick both up on time (already a day late for one of them) so he asked me to do a favor for him and pick up one gift while he picked up the other. I said no. He told me I could do a favor for him since he's my dad yada yada. I said no. The day came and went and I didn't get it. He freaked out and told me I was going to ruin the birthday. He told me I could have done a favor for him as we're all family. I told him I don't owe him or his wife or his favorite kids any favors. I reminded him that he owed his kids being a good dad and he wasn't to the three of us so I'm not going to save his ass or do something that makes his favorite family happy because innocent or not they are not my problem. He said I was such a child. Then he got my uncle to say how disappointed he was that I acted so petty.

The first couple of times, I was confused. I tried to explain that I'm not Japanese and that I don't appreciate being greeted in Japanese, but they were already walking away quickly, and there were a lot of people around. 

So, the third time this happened, I quickly and loudly responded with ""Bonjour"" in French. Honestly, it felt pretty good to do it. But now, I'm questioning whether what I did was ethical. 

Am I lowering myself to their level by responding in this way, or am I justified in standing up for myself?

So, the third time this happened, I quickly and loudly responded with ""Bonjour"" in French. Honestly, it felt pretty good to do it. But now, I'm questioning whether what I did was ethical. 

Am I lowering myself to their level by responding in this way, or am I justified in standing up for myself?

68,1fcnku1,AITA for telling my sister with ADHD that she doesn't have time blindness she's just inconsiderate ,"Important Context: I M20 have a rocky relationship with my sister F19 despite are almost nonexistent age gap. Its a long complicated story but one of thing things I have always  hated was the fact that she would insist that nothing is ever wrong with me medically my father just randomly dropped our insurance coverage and because of my moms adhd she just keeps forgetting to sue for child support and we just kept having things  change in out lives so since I was 15 I haven't had insurance meaning Id have to guess everything wrong with me (with proper research) but with my sister she has denied everything from Autism to restless leg syndrome. The biggest ones she has a problem with is my toruets and my autism wail I'm undiagnosed its verry obvious I have both I've had involuntary movements since I was 12 and I pass criteria for low support needs Autism as well as almost all of my autistic friends/boyfriend agree that its pretty likely and I'm not faking.     

One of the biggest things I experience is Time blindness and not the tik tok ""Oh I'm just always 15 minuets late"" type the I never know what time, day and year is. I still forget we are in 2024 and almost ate pudding that expired a year ago because I still thought it was 2023. Or a week ago I took the dog outside at 2 in the morning and didn't know until i went to check a message I got and was shocked. My blindness is debilitating I'm not late because I just ""forget"" a few things I'm late because I try to sleep in and forget I've been trying to brush my hair for 10 minuets.         

Now for the story, my sister and mom wear joking about adhd and how they are always late. My sister who is daddies favorite still has insurance and got diagnosed and my mom isn't diagnosed but both her daughters (I'm adopted) have it so its pretty obvious. But I watch them and learned there traits epically since growing up I would stare at them angry because I was told we needed to leave for school/events 5-15 minutes ago so I learned why there late. My mom its because of adhd she leaves things all over  the house and cant remember where she left them. Her shoes, keys, coffee, and phone without fail will be in different rooms. My Sister its only half adhd related, she spends time doing hair and makeup every day and cares about that more than her being on time. So when she's saying ""yhea I have time blindness"" I got verry upset  it makes a excuse for your stupid habits and minimizes a real issue that makes it hard to perform basic functions. So I told her that doing her hair and makeup isn't time blindness its just not caring about being on time                  

  
she gets angry at me and tells ME I don't have time blindness and shouldn't talk about it because ""Its Rude to people like me who actually do get diagnosed"" and my mom AGREED so i just went to my room and now I'm starting to feel like I'm at square 1 of this relationship

I work for a company (for almost 3 years) that I enjoy the people and it is easy work, but it has terrible sick policy (can only use injury/illness time for hospital stays, or after the first year if you are out for 3 or more days in a roll and even then you can only use 8 hours total, it increases after 5 years to 16 hours). Any other time you are sick you have to use PTO. I currently have over 100 hours of injury/illness time that I won't qualify to use, and 24 hours of PTO time available.

I have bad mental health and get sick fairly often so I miss a day every month or two but always have PTO to cover. But I work every extra hour of overtime they allow me, my performance at work has always been good.

(My mother is in stage 4 kidney failure and is in dialysis, she has lost all of her fight over the past couple years. It is a struggle to get her to eat or bathe and I have trouble remembering to give her her morning insulin when she doesn't remind me. Her refusal to do anything has made her develop a bruise on her bottom and her blood work has been terrible recently. My fiance and I have moved in to take care of her, he has even quit his job. But I can only do so much, I can't physically force her to shower or eat foods she refuses to. I wash her with a warm rag and soap multiple times a week and make sure she gets 3 meals a day, even if two of them are small and not the best for her. Getting her to eat at all has been a fight and a battle. Watching my mother give up and lose the fight to have a good quality of life has destroyed my mental health. But to the drama, some of my family who does not even call her, let alone see her, came over and threatened to call protective services on me and started a huge family fight because people that aren't involved in her daily care told them of her issues and how I am neglectful in caring for her properly)

I woke up still feeling super anxious and have been crying all morning, and it has caused me to have some bathroom issues.

So in a split second decision I texted my boss and told them I would be out because I was sick and contagious. Which has now made my anxiety worse and I feel like I am going to have another panic attack because that was a lie.

Well today I got paid and took my son out for an hour to give her time alone and brought her a massive cream and jam donut, it‚Äôs rare I can afford things for her so I wanted to buy her this donut. She just said thanks but didn‚Äôt really say anything and I never thought about it.

Later on we had an argument about how she feels I treat her and in the argument she lashed out about the donut that I‚Äôm trying to sabotage her and don‚Äôt respect her wishes to lose weight and apparently she‚Äôs only worth food being bought for her never mind an actual present. 

I just wanted to get her a treat, she‚Äôs been down the past few days as she found out her late mums pension isn‚Äôt paying anything out to her and I wanted to cheer her up but now I‚Äôm sabotaging her diet. 

TLDR - Just wanted to be nice and her a donut when I know she‚Äôs been unhappy with her weight and finally doing something about it, AITAH?",1.0,1.015745997428894,1,1

Me and my roommate recently bought a set of patio furniture for our balcony. We agreed to split the cost like this: I paid the first installment, she paid the second installment, and then we split the last installment in half. All 3 installments were equal. 

For the last installment, I needed a few days to have the money in my account, so I asked her if it was okay to pay her on September 5th (when I got paid). She said fine. The last installment was on Aug 30 so it was a couple of days. I‚Äôve paid her my half now, so my share of the patio furniture is all paid off.

Then over the weekend, we were settling our monthly bills and she noticed I had savings in my account when I had my bank app up. She made a comment about it and I could tell she was upset about something. She started asking if I could pay part of the interest she was accruing because she had to put some of the installments on her credit card. I said no, because I already paid my share of the furniture. She was really upset and started crying.

I said I could pay interest that accrued from August 30 (the last installment) to September 5 (when I paid the last of my share) but it hasn't been 30 days so no interest has been added yet.

80,1fclkv0,AITA for calling my mothers bluff and moving?,"Edit: title: ""moving out""

I (20m) was living with my mother, stepfather, twin brothers and 3 sisters aged 6-13.

My stepfather is a truck driver and never home, my mother also works so she often arrives home later than I did from University, so it was my job to make sure that the kids had dinner and she asked me to help her a lot with chores.

It was fine before University, but this last year (My first in uni) I felt that it was too much as this is not high school.

During the summer break, I got a part-time job in the same place where I did my internship in the spring, but with school starting again there will be very few hours and they pay me an hourly wage and extra for finishing tasks. As it is work from home job, I could do it any time I have free time, but with 5 smaller siblings and school, there is not much free time at all.

At the end of August my mother suddenly told me, that as I work now, I should pay rent! 300‚Ç¨ per month! And I replied, ""It is more than half of what I will make when school starts!""  
She just replied: ""Well, adults either pay rent or move out!""

I had an idea, I posted in a Facebook group for the district where the University is, that I look for rooms to rent for cheap and can even offer help with kids - all I want is a private room, I can buy my own food.  
(I could not afford even a stereo in the area)

I got a reply from a Single mother ""Rachel"" who told me she had a deal for me and wanted to meet first to get to know me.  
She told me that she had a 2-bedroom apartment, but could move herself into the living room and give me the bedroom, she was offered a way better job, but it is not 9-5 and she has 7-year-old ""Emma"" who just started school. I took it!  
I have to take care of her when she works, I pay no rent and don't even have to buy food, as a babysitter would be way more expensive for her.  
Meanwhile - babysitting a well-raised 7-year-old is very easy.

I have been living there from the start of school in 2. September and I love it! On the days ""Rachel"" works I walk with ""Emma"" to her school on my way to University and back after, cook us something to eat and usually, her mother arrives when it is bedtime.  
When she has the night shift, it is even easier -  bath-teeth-bed, and morning is no different than other days.

On Saturday I took her to a huge park/playground near the University and we allowed her to help with cooking the lunch.

On Sunday I had a ""day off"" and visited my ""real home"" and my mother was so pissed, 13-year-old twins are terrible at home chores and told me that I let her down!  
She told me that I act like a self-centred asshole and now pretend to be a kid in a different family.  
I love my mother and siblings, I will visit home at weekends when I have time, but I will not go back to living there.

84,1fclb66,AITA for seeking legal advice,"A mate , let's say his name is (Reg), asked me if I was interested in investing in a invention of his (we'll call it a rail box), that he can sell to companies involved in the railway industry. I was hesitant at first, though he sent me an email from a large engineering company, that wanted two of his (rail boxes) built within 6 weeks and sent to WA, and potentialtially another 13 rail boxes built. 
I would recieve a commission from each rail box built, and I would double my investment if all 15 rail boxes were built and sold to this engineering company.
A contract was drawn up by my mate (Reg), and a condition was, if his rail box didn't work or sell, he would pay me back, double my investment.
I didn't have the money he required, so 2 other mates invested to make up the funds to draw up and build the rail boxes. 
6 weeks went by and I asked Reg if the boxes were built. Reg came up with family excuses. This continued for over a year and a half, and now Reg won't answer any attemps to contact him. 
I understand Reg may have had alot of family issues, but he has really screwed myself and other 2 mates over. What makes things complicated, he lives in Adelaide and we are in Perth.  I mentioned that I would be happy with my initial investment back, but now I think that Reg is being an a$$hole for ignoring us and I think I should seek double my investment, as stated in the contract.

85,1fcl9u8,AITA for not letting my dad copy my brother's letter to me so my half siblings can think he wrote to them too?,"My older brother Jamie died 7 months ago. He was 20. Before he died he wrote a letter for me and another for our dad. His letter to me was him apologizing for leaving, saying he loved me, he wanted me to have a good life and things like that. Dad's letter was different. Jamie told dad we always knew he cheated on our mom, that he was disgusted to be his son, that he didn't tell him he was sick because he didn't want dad to fake grieve him like he did our mom, he didn't want dad's tears or anguish, that he felt like dad not getting the chance to say goodbye was justice for his affair, his affair child and for the hell he put the two of us through when we were so young and losing our mom. I only know the content of dad's letter because he told me about it and wanted to know if I felt similar in any way and I told him I did.

My dad had other kids with his wife, the affair partner (or one of them?). My half sisters are 11 and 10 and my half brother is 8. I'm 17M because I know I didn't mention that. And the timeline was mom was sick for like a year. She died when I was 5 and my brother was 8. Dad was a dad again only 6 months after she died and his wife was living with us before that point. Dad never explained it to us. He relied on us being young, and boys, and not knowing enough about pregnancy to realize.

My brother always kept his distance from our half siblings and he wanted no part of being their brother. I feel similarly but I'll try to be nice because we live in the same house. But now that Jamie's gone I feel like I lost my only sibling and I don't love or care about my half siblings or think of them as real siblings.

Which might be why I'm resisting here but anyway. Dad knows I have a letter from Jamie. But Jamie didn't write anything to our half siblings. So dad wants to make a copy of the letter and make it look like it's to all of us (so edit it). He said ever since the girls found out I got one, they've been upset and they grieve for Jamie too and they don't deserve the weight of being unloved by their brother and knowing they'll never get to have a kind message from Jamie. He said Jamie never said I love you to them or hugged them or gave them any of his heart. And it's not their fault. But some of the pain can be eased if they think he thought of them. He said we'll just say I was being possessive of the letter and it was never just mine. I didn't agree to share the letter and I told dad I don't want him to edit it.

He got really mad at me and asked me how I can have such a small age gap between me and my half sister, how I could live with them for 11 years and not want to save them from this. He asked me if I had become such a monster.

Background: I (19F) am currently sharing a dorm with my friend (19F) who I‚Äôll call Dana. Dana and I have been close friends for the past 6 years. We‚Äôve had some issues in the past due to me being sensitive, while she doesn't really sympathize with others. We roomed together during freshman year. We didn‚Äôt have any major issues. Additionally, I‚Äôve been working on trying to be less of a people pleaser and a doormat more recently, so I‚Äôve been trying to stick up for myself.



About a week ago, I was in our kitchen talking with Dana and two of her friends, who I‚Äôll call Natalie (19F) and Ella (20F). Natalie and Ella are Dana‚Äôs friends, but they have been nice towards me. During the conversation, Natalie mentioned that she had worked somewhere where she took classes. The following conversation happened:¬†



Me - ‚ÄúOh you worked there? I didn‚Äôt know that‚Äù

Dana - ‚ÄúWell yeah, she took classes there‚Äù.¬†

Me - ‚ÄúYeah, I know. But I didn‚Äôt know that she had a job there‚Äù

Dana - ‚ÄúWell why wouldn‚Äôt she?‚Äù

Me - ‚ÄúDid you work at \[the place we took classes\]?‚Äù

Dana - ‚ÄúNo, because I didn‚Äôt want to‚Äù

Me - ‚ÄúOkay, so her taking classes there doesn‚Äôt automatically mean that she worked there‚Äù

Me - ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not mad, don‚Äôt talk to me like I‚Äôm slow. Don‚Äôt piss me off‚Äù



Dana, Natalie, and Ella proceeded to start laughing hysterically. Embarrassed, I collected my stuff and went into my bedroom. I stayed there until I heard them leave, showered, and returned to my room. I didn‚Äôt have any interactions with them (different class times) until about two days later, when I was eating dinner while listening to music. Ella knocked on my bedroom door and asked if I had a plastic spoon (I bought plastic silverware and I keep it in my bedroom, as well as other supplies). Reluctantly, I got up, grabbed a spoon and handed it to her. When I opened the door, I saw Dana behind her, peeking out from a wall in the kitchen. I didn‚Äôt say anything and closed the door. I‚Äôm partially sure that Dana had Ella ask me (it‚Äôs something she‚Äôs done in the past).¬†



Dana, Natalie, and Ella didn‚Äôt speak to me after that, and I didn‚Äôt make an effort to speak to them either. Today, Dana knocked on my door and said something along the lines of ‚ÄúYou need to take out the trash. You can be mad all you want, but it‚Äôs your turn to take it out‚Äù. This irritated me, but it‚Äôs also made me think about if I‚Äôm taking this too far. I asked my mom and two of my friends, who all think that I should give it some time, then try and work things out.

89,1fcl171,AITA for inviting a friend over to my house that my flatmate doesn‚Äôt like?,"So for context I‚Äôve been living with my current flatmate for about a year and a half now. We are colleagues but have a very different circle of friends at work. 

A few months after she moved in, she asked me if I would be comfortable with her boyfriend living with us for a couple of weeks while he switched jobs. I agreed, but two weeks quickly became three months. He didn‚Äôt pay rent or contribute to bills in anyway, however my flatmate paid an additional $30 in rent fortnightly to cover his share. Although this didn‚Äôt remotely cover his share of the bill, and I wasn‚Äôt super comfortable with him living with us, I did not say anything.

My flatmate regularly has her friends over (every 2-3 days) and they are all extremely judgemental and gossipy. I‚Äôm not super comfortable with her friends nor how regularly they come over, as all they do is badmouth our colleagues (often in unprofessional ways related to looks, personality, etc) but I know she‚Äôs not responsible for my discomfort, so I never brought it up.  

This brings us to now. I have a group of friends that I am planning on going on a trip overseas with and I had invited them over  to start booking accomodation, flights,etc. One of the girls in my group of friends, my flatmate doesn‚Äôt like and she‚Äôs been vocal to me in the past about not liking her. My friend‚Äôs personality is very bubbly, bright and loud, which is a direct contrast to my flatmates more serious personality. I texted my flatmate out of politeness to let her know that I was having my friends over and my flatmate came back saying that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with her in the house and doesn‚Äôt want me to invite her over again unless she‚Äôs not in the house. I was a little taken a back, but as she had used the word ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô, I didn‚Äôt want her feeling unsafe, and I agreed to pause my plans and asked if we could talk face to face about this.

It‚Äôs been two days since this has played out and I haven‚Äôt spoken to my flatmate yet. I‚Äôve since learnt that it isn‚Äôt a case of being ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô for my flatmate, and more that she just can‚Äôt stand my friend‚Äôs personality and finds her overtly annoying. 

At first I was angry and upset because I felt like I‚Äôd bent over backwards for her in the past despite my own discomfort around the people she has over. After some reflection however, I realised that I‚Äôve been partly to blame as I‚Äôve never once spoken up about my own discomforts, and it‚Äôs not fair for me to expect her to swallow her discomfort with my friend just because I did the same for her.

But now I don‚Äôt know what to do.

But in this group is this one friend of ours (18f) who asked if she could pay me back in a couple weeks when her student loan comes through. I said no and she asked why because she knows I have lots (comparatively) saved up.

91,1fcklum,AITA for my childhood friends talking behind my back?,"I (22f) haven‚Äôt had contact with my childhood friends since we all went our separate ways after starting university. Most of us don‚Äôt follow each other anymore. 

Recently, I found out that the ones who still keep in touch have been talking badly about me. I‚Äôve noticed them occasionally looking at my stories, even though they don‚Äôt follow me. Since then, I‚Äôve made my account private, but I keep getting follow requests from what seem to be fake accounts, and I have a strong suspicion it‚Äôs them.

For a long time, I thought it was just a ‚Äúthem problem.‚Äù I‚Äôve never felt the need to check up on them or talk behind their backs. 

But lately, I‚Äôve been reflecting on our past, and I‚Äôve realized that I made mistakes during our friendship too. Maybe the reason we drifted apart wasn‚Äôt just a coincidence. I think unresolved issues and hurt feelings may have led to long-lasting resentment that‚Äôs still there.

All of us hurt each other in some way. It was never a healthy friendship. But I think it‚Äôs important for me to take accountability for my part in what happened. And I know it‚Äôs unfair to make a post like this without mentioning what I did, so here it is:

1.  All of us had a crush on one of the girls older brothers, who was 7 years older than us. When I turned 18, he started messaging me and reacting to my Instagram stories. I liked him but didn‚Äôt flirt back because I knew my friend wouldn‚Äôt be happy about it. I even showed her the messages. Later, he asked me out for drinks, which wasn‚Äôt a date because one of his guy friends was joining too. I told my friend (his sister) about it, and she encouraged me to go. I asked if she wanted to join us, but she said no. After we went out drinking, he asked me out for dinner, and I agreed. But then he blocked me. Much later, I found out she got mad at him for going after me, and their mom made him block me. I realize now I was wrong for going and not being more sensitive to how she felt.

2. One summer, a new guy joined our group, and one of the girls ‚Äúcalled dibs‚Äù on him. The problem was, he didn‚Äôt like her. He was very persistent and annoying with me, I wasn‚Äôt interested in him, but I thought I could help by including her whenever he asked me out. I‚Äôd agree to go but would always ask if I could bring her along. I was wrong for doing this because I knew he didn‚Äôt like her, but I was hoping it might change. Eventually, the group thought he liked her because they hung out a lot, even without me. So, they encouraged her to confess her feelings, which she did, but he rejected her and admitted he liked me instead.

Hey fellow Redditors,

I'm struggling in my long-distance relationship and could use some advice. My boyfriend has become completely consumed by his job and barely makes time for me. We used to be close, but since his mom passed away recently, he's pulled away from me. He says he's not attached to anyone anymore, but I've noticed he's still making time for others.

He was a nice guy before...even 2 months back he used to check on me find time for relationship and all..I don't know what suddenly happened he just started ignoring me. Even when I'm sick and hospitalized he didn't even called and asked whether im okay or not. We had sex and I got uti from him and I went to very bad pain and issues. I was very broke to visit hospital at that time.  I told him several times about my pain and I even cried nights without sleeping because of the pain. He didn't even cared to take me to hospital nor ask me whether im okay or not. Atlast I went all alone with this pain and bleeding. He got time to go out with his office people  and all. He wasn't like this before unless he joined thiss new workplace.

We've talked about it, but I feel like he's hiding things from me. I'm deeply invested in this relationship and can't imagine a day without him. I feel like there is someone else instead of me in his life now. Has anyone else experienced something similar? How did you handle it? Should I hold on to hope or reevaluate the relationship?

TL;DR - Boyfriend's become distant since his mom's passing, says he's not attached to anyone, but still makes time for others. Feeling lost and unsure about the relationship's future.""

95,1fck0ir,AITA for inviting a friend over to my house that my flatmate doesn‚Äôt like?,"So for context I‚Äôve been living with my current flatmate for about a year and a half now. We are colleagues but have a very different circle of friends at work. At home, she is definitely the more social of us, with people coming over to our house regularly (every 2-3 days). It‚Äôs never in a ‚Äòparty-animal‚Äù way, just small groups of her work friends who come over for drinks. She doesn‚Äôt usually let me know until the day of, but up until now I‚Äôve never really had much of a problem with it. I‚Äôm more of an introverted person and like my space, and while I would prefer it if she didn‚Äôt invite people over every second day, I know that we share the house and my discomfort isn‚Äôt her responsibility. I have in the past opted to spend time away from the house if I don‚Äôt feel like socialising and I‚Äôve never expressed a problem with her having people over frequently. 

For extra context, I need to mention the matter of her boyfriend. A few months after she moved in, she asked me if I would be comfortable with her boyfriend living with us for a couple of weeks while he switched jobs. I agreed, but two weeks quickly became three months of him ‚Äúliving with us‚Äù, with each week ending with a ‚Äúhe‚Äôll stay one more week‚Äù until he eventually moved out. He didn‚Äôt pay rent or contribute to bills in anyway, however my flatmate paid an additional $30 in rent fortnightly to cover his share. Although this didn‚Äôt actually adequately cover his share, I knew that if I had asked for more money it would have come from her and not him, and I did not want to put this onto her. I kept my mouth shut and while I wasn‚Äôt super comfortable with him living with us for those additional months especially given how small our apartment is, I again did not speak up. 

Recently, and we are talking within the last week, she invited a friend (friend A) to stay over. As she had already made plans with another friend (friend B) in another city, she let me know that friend A would stay the night at our house while herself and friend b stayed the night in the city. While I wasn‚Äôt super thrilled or comfortable with the thought of living with a complete stranger for the night while my flatmate wasn‚Äôt there, I again agreed to it. 

While my flatmate has been very polite to me (at least to my face haha) her and her group of our colleagues she is close with are who I would have considered your cliche ‚Äòmean girls‚Äô at high school. They like to talk bad about others behind their back, they gossip and they are extremely judgemental. I‚Äôm not super comfortable with her friends when they come over as all they do is badmouth our colleagues (often in extremely unprofessional ways related to looks, personality, etc) but again I know she‚Äôs not responsible for my discomfort, so I never brought it up.  

This brings us to now. I have a group of friends that I am planning on going on a girls trip overseas with and I had planned to invite them over one afternoon to start booking accomodation, flights,etc. One of the girls in my group of friends, my flatmate doesn‚Äôt like and she‚Äôs been vocal to me in the past about not liking her. She knows that I am friends with her, and when she has talked bad about her to my face, I have defended my friend. My friend‚Äôs personality is very bubbly, bright and loud, which is a direct contrast to my flatmates more serious personality. I texted my flatmate out of politeness to let her know that I was having my friends over, including the girl she doesn‚Äôt like, and my flatmate came back saying that she doesn‚Äôt feel comfortable with her in the house and doesn‚Äôt want me to invite her over again unless she‚Äôs not in the house. I was shocked and a little taken a back, but as she had used the word ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô I agreed to hold our plans and asked if we could talk face to face about this. I wasn‚Äôt sure what uncomfortable meant at this time, and I didn‚Äôt want to put her into a situation where she felt unsafe so I agreed immediately to put our plans on hold. 

It‚Äôs been two days since this has played out and I haven‚Äôt spoken to my flatmate yet. I‚Äôve since learnt that it isn‚Äôt a case of being ‚Äòuncomfortable‚Äô for my flatmate, and more that she just can‚Äôt stand my friends personality and finds her overtly annoying. 

At first I was angry and upset when she texted to say that she doesn‚Äôt want my friend coming over again, because I felt like I‚Äôd bent over backwards for her in the past despite my own discomfort in the situations she put me in, only for her to be upset when I invite my friend over for a change because she doesn‚Äôt like their personalities.

After some reflection however I realised that I‚Äôve been partly to blame as I‚Äôve never once spoken up about my own discomforts, and it‚Äôs not fair for me to expect her to swallow her discomfort with my friend just because I did the same for her. She is stating a boundary and I am now upset because I wasn‚Äôt strong enough of a person to state mine in the past.

But now I don‚Äôt know what to do. While I acknowledge I can‚Äôt be mad at her for not stomaching her discomfort like I did for her this past year, I still can‚Äôt help but feel like she‚Äôs wrong to ‚Äòban‚Äô my friend from coming over again just because she doesn‚Äôt like her?

96,1fcjlrj,AITA for repeatedly trying to talk to my wife? ,"I (31m) have been married to my wife (29f) for almost 7 years. We have a great relationship, I love her and I know she loves me. 

The issue I have is that 3 weeks ago, my wife had a miscarriage. It was her fifth pregnancy- our second, (edit: second pregnancy, one loss for us. We have a son) she has two kids with her ex husband, and she also lost one with him.

Since we've been together she's lost all her grandparents, a brother, and her mother and I've never seen her shed a tear. You could see she's upset but she will not talk about it. 

So she miscarried our baby, and when she came home from the doctor's office she was stone faced. No reaction at all. At first I thought it was shock, trauma, I don't fucking know. I've asked her how she is, I took all the time I could off work so I could do everything with the kids and the house, but she told me to cancel the time off.

I'm talking whole body shaking with tears kind of crying. When I asked her about it, she denied she was even crying. 

I keep trying to talk to her because I don't want her to feel like she's alone but any time I bring it up she gets angry and lashes out and tells me to leave her alone about it.

She said I should wait up then but I just pointed out the club night finishes at 3am so I'm not waiting up until 3 just to possibly book a taxi. I pointed out she's more than capable of sorting out her own taxis. 

She said she wasn't asking for much and that it's only one night but I just said she can't expect me to sit around waiting for her.

Like for example this happened yesterday, I was speaking with my youngest sister (6f) and my ex came in to talk to me so I told my sister to give me a second but if anyone has younger siblings or young kids you know how they can be when they want your attention lol. So as he was trying to speak to me my sister kept repeating my name but I was looking at my ex and told him to continue speaking, instead of doing so he muttered under his breath ‚Äúnever f*cking mind‚Äù and slammed the door on his way out of the room. Of course there is other instances but that‚Äôs the most recent one.

Now onto the part where I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm the a hole or not. So it‚Äôs my birthday in two days and I want to invite my friends over this weekend and there will be about 6 people there maybe more and majority of them despise my ex due to past events (which I don‚Äôt blame them for) and even though we‚Äôve broken up I don‚Äôt want anything happening between them all. So I asked him to go stay at his dads for the weekend while I have this celebration. He got annoyed at me and said ‚Äúis this why you don‚Äôt want to go to the cinema with me?‚Äù (He had asked if I wanted to go to the cinema with him for my birthday and I declined because I think he could use the money he has for other things) and I explained that it wasn‚Äôt the reason I declined and that they were on different days he then just stared at me, grabbed some pancakes I had made and before leaving said in a angry tone ‚Äúthat‚Äôs really not a nice f*cking feeling.‚Äù And slammed the door on his way out again. My dad spoke to me after and asked what happened and I explained it all and my dad just hugged me and told me it‚Äôll be okay. I then went into my sisters room and cried. I feel bad because I told him I wasn‚Äôt gonna make him leave but I don‚Äôt want issues to happen during the event and I also don‚Äôt want him there because previously he has made the mood of events bad and I want this one to be happy. Am I the a hole? 

UPDATE: so we just had an argument. I asked him if he was actually going to his dad‚Äôs and he got really annoyed and was yelling at me, asking me why he should leave. I was explaining myself and he wasn‚Äôt taking it, saying it was a stupid reason and that if I‚Äôm bothered by him being there I should have my celebration at one of my friends house. I didn‚Äôt know that throughout our whole argument my sister was in the other room and recording it, she sent it to my parents and my dad texted me saying he‚Äôs speaking to him when he gets back. I‚Äôm so glad my sister was there so I wouldn‚Äôt have to explain everything to my dad once he got back from work. I‚Äôll update everyone on what happens after my dad gets back from work, and thank you guys so so much for all the comments. You‚Äôve helped me realise I need to stop being a doormat to everyone I meet. Even though I know it‚Äôll probably be a gradual thing but I know I need to work on it a lot more. 

UPDATE TWO: sorry for not updating immediately after my dad got back from work, yesterday was a stressful day lol. my dad spoke to my ex and he gave him a deadline to leave! He will be leaving on the 12th, so in two days. My dad spoke to him calmly and even wrote a note to the council to help him get housing. I also wanna address some comments that I‚Äôve gotten. So I have five younger siblings and only one of them live with me and my dad and that‚Äôs the sister that recorded the argument between me and my ex, she‚Äôs 15 almost 16. The rest live with my mum and only come over every second weekend which is why my youngest sister was mentioned in the post yesterday. Also my ex never paid anything in the house at all. Basically we started dating two years ago when I was 14 and he was 15, we went through a lot together, including him being kicked out of his step mums house after his dad and her broke up. His dad didn‚Äôt have a place to go so my parents took my ex bf in while his dad was sorting things out (this was before my parents got divorced) and he was living with my family for a while then my mum kicked him out. Then in the July of 2023 my dad got temporary housing and me and my ex moved there then we moved into our current place in July of 2023. And yeah, three houses later he never paid a penny. 

He does get money from his dad btw, he just never put it into the house even when we desperately needed it. Which we got into arguments about but it never solved anything. Also I can understand why some people may be upset with my dad and I don‚Äôt blame you at all but please try and understand that my dad is a very sympathetic person to people in bad/no living situations because he was once homeless and had no where to go and had to build his way up to get a job and small flat. And many of you were telling me to just kick his ass out, I want you to understand that i physically couldn‚Äôt. Even when I asked him to leave for the weekend he refused and told me to go elsewhere for my birthday celebration and tried to negotiate with me even when I put my foot down and told him to get out. I never thought that this relationship would turn out this way, when we met he was so kind and considerate. Maybe i just let him get away with too much because I felt bad for everything he went through in his life but as most of you said, he‚Äôs not my issue anymore and I don‚Äôt need to worry about him anymore. 

Also in case you wanna know how the conversation between him and my dad went, from what my dad told me, my dad basically told him that he heard everything that my ex said and that if he ever speaks to me like that again he will floor him lol and that my ex has to leave by Thursday and will stay out. He also said to my ex that all of his stuff will be kept safe, nothing will be damaged out of spite or anger and that he will get everything back. My ex just put his head down after my dad mentioned that he heard how he was speaking to me and apologised and agreed to leave. Kinda crazy how it took my dad to talk to my ex to make my ex feel actually bad about how he spoke to me. He‚Äôs yelled at me in the past and only apologised hours later which I didn‚Äôt really feel like was a genuine apology. I know majority of you were expecting my dad to absolutely batter him, and to be honest he probably would‚Äôve if he hadn‚Äôt calmed down first haha but in all honesty my dad isn‚Äôt a violent person, he uses words more then actions but don‚Äôt get me wrong if my ex decided to be an asshole to my dad he probably wouldn‚Äôt have been so nice. 

Anyways that‚Äôs all I have to say for now, thank you all for the advice and comments. It really meant a lot, I shouldn‚Äôt have to update anymore but to be honest who knows what can happen. I just hope my ex will find a girl that he treats a lot better then he did me, and I hope these past two years was a lesson for him on how to treat people and how to respect peoples houses. I mean I think these past two years have taught me to respect myself and not to take shit from anyone, especially a boy who doesn‚Äôt have respect for anyone. Again, thank you all! And I‚Äôm so sorry this post is so long lmao. And I do apologise if the first part of this whole post is kind of messy, a lot was going on in my head yesterday but I‚Äôm feeling a lot better knowing my ex will be gone from my life soon. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-09,"AITA for asking my ex to leave so I can have a girls night?  Okay so basically for a lil backstory I (17f) broke up with my boyfriend (18m) about a month ago, it didn‚Äôt go bad but it didn‚Äôt go good. He has been living with me and my dad for over a year now and I told him after we broke up that I wouldn‚Äôt kick him out because I know he can‚Äôt get a house easily (due to the long waiting lists we have in the UK right now) and because he doesn‚Äôt have a job but I told him that he can stay here and get on his feet a bit.

108,1fchj5x,AITA for having male discord friends? ,"Me and my ex were together for almost 4 years, and during those 4 years he abused me mentally, emotionally and sometimes physically. He is a very rude person with anger issues and he very often talks about how women are terrible at everything and can never do anything right and he also talks very negatively about other races if you can imagine. I am embarrassed to say I stayed with him as long as I did but I felt stuck and even when I did try to leave multiple times he would somehow convince me to stay and tbh I was scared. My ex would say things like how he hopes my next boyfriend ruins my life and does terrible things to me that I can‚Äôt say here. I would also like to preface that he did cheat on me and I forgave him stupidly. During our 4 year relationship we never had sex only did other things because to be completely honest my body never wanted to, how am I supposed to want to give that part of myself to you when I am constantly being yelled at and told I‚Äôm ugly and being abused every day. Well my ex decided to make a post about how I cheated because I had male discord friends and you can choose to believe me or not but I never cheated, he was controlling and didn‚Äôt like the fact I played Fortnite with other guys.

He even posted on there about how he finally gets to go back to Ohio to see his mom, I told him every week he needed to go see her and he told me she was the worst mom ever and he hated his family. Even though he did all these things to me when I left I told him I wish nothing but the best for him  and I appreciated our memories together and yet he still decided to come on this forum and blast our personal life.

111,1fcgpys,AITA for refusing to pick up my sister from the airport?,"My sister lives out of state. She's flying in to visit my parents who live near me. The airport is a \~3  hour round trip. I've had issues with the drive in the past and made it clear to my sister in past years that I would not pick her up in the future. Still, she asked me to pick her up and I said no. However, I did offer:  
-to pick her up at the airport shuttle drop-off near my house  
-to help her return a rental car if she wanted to go with that option instead  
  
Then, a few days after telling my sister no, my mother asked me why I wouldn't pick up my sister, and a few days after that our other sibling also confronted me. I feel like I'm being guilt tripped over this. Clearly my sister is talking to my other family members behind my back, trying to manipulate them into trying to help her convince me to pick her up from the airport. It's driving me a little crazy.

Background info: On one occasion several years ago when I was picking my sister up from the airport she had agreed to give me gas money - then she didn't. On another occasion I got a speeding ticket while making the drive. Basically it's become an annoying ordeal. My sister is wealthy enough to be able to easily afford a rental car or shuttle fare. Although I will be happy to see her (it's not like we hate each other) I did not invite her, nor was I involved in any of the planning process of her trip.

112,1fcge4d,AITA for not clearing my graduation gift with my SIL,"My 36(f) graduation gift oldest niece (18f) was to take her on a trip to a destination of her choosing. I talked with my brother (her dad) before offering this and basically outlined my parameters for the distance/ length of stay i was willing to cover. In this conversation with my brother I also  told him he and his wife, my SIL, and their younger children were welcome to join but I would book myself and my niece independently (i.e. how I would book if I were traveling just us two). My brother was totally cool with this plan and thanked me for giving his daughter this opportunity.

So my nieces graduation came around and I wrapped a print out of a fake gift certificate to anywhere in the world - my niece was so excited and started throwing out a bunch of different places (botswana, India, Peru) all of which I told her I was game for, she just had to pick her favorite. Her mom (my SIL) cuts in and tells her she needs to think of places inside the US because I was not taking her anywhere abroad.

I was very taken aback by this because I cleared international travel with my brother. In the moment I told my niece that she and I would talk, because I didn't want to publically undermine her mom but I also didn't want to hold her back from the opportunities I plan to offer all my nieces. For context this is my oldest niece who is my brother's only child. My sister has 3 girls and I told both my siblings this is what I wanted to do for all my nieces when they graduated high school and then all seemed happy about it.

My niece is very close with her mom and I have not bonded with her the same way I have with my sister's kids (because they live twice as far(plus my sister FTs me often verus my brother) so I thought this would be a great opportunity for me to show her how much I care for all my nieces equally (I plan to do this for all my nieces). My brother told me I should just pay for her and her mom to go on the trip by themselves since I can afford it (which I transparently can) but I feel like this is my SIL taking advantage of me. It would be one thing if my niece asked if her mom could come but she seemed very comfortable without her mom in planning and sending me links for activities just for the two of us.

My SIL has riled us a bunch of my relatives but honestly I feel like this has gotten blown out of proportion. I don't have kids so I guess I'm just wondering if I'm missing something here that makes me the AH. I don't think I am but literally all my relatives are messaging me saying otherwise so I'm very confused.

It was Emily's birthday two days ago. I arrived 8 minutes later than I promised I would. Gave her the box of chocolates and the birthday card, said 'Hi' to people and then chatted with one of her friends. Not flirting, just smiling and catching up.

Then Jessica tapped my shoulder and pointed to Emily. Emily was talking to her cousin but she was looking at me. Or rather, glaring. Fists clenched.

Jessica then told me that Emily is jealous. She thinks I have a chance now and told me to ask her out again. I just don't know. Obviously 'No means no' but it's been six years. On the other hand, she hasn't shown difference in attitude towards me in the six years. No indication she sees me differently.

So I told Jessica that she is probably wrong and the glaring is probably just because I arrived late. Jessica looked quite offended, saying that I shouldn't presume to think that I know her daughter better than she does.

122,1fcf4xa,AITA for refusing to give my niece what she wants for her birthday?,"Yesterday, we had a big family gathering, which meant my older sister (29) and her daughter (6) came over. For half of the day, everything was well and good. After lunch, my sister got tired, so I (27F) volunteered to look after my niece when my sister took a nap.

Now, I have a collection of stuff animals and 20cm (7.8 inches for those in America) dolls, which I let my niece played with when her mother napped. Then my sister woke up, joined us, and we spent some more time together before she announced it was time for them to leave.

This was when my niece pointed at the doll I was holding and said she liked him, and that she wanted me to give him to her. I told her that she could get any other doll and/or stuff animals that she wanted from my collection, just not this one. My niece got really upset and started crying, saying that her birthday was coming (it's next week), and she wanted that doll as her birthday present. Again, I told her I couldn't give him to her, explaining to her he was very important to me.

I didn't tell my niece in detail about why he is important to me, because she's still too young to understand, but I will explain it here to give a clearer picture. I've had this doll for a long while now, back in the darkest time of my life, when nothing seemed to go right for me. I was advised to find an outlet, letting out my thoughts either in the form of writing or drawing. One of my drawings was the design for the doll in this post. I spent a lot of time with it, shading it, coloring it and all that. Then I got the idea of turning the drawing into something physical. I searched and searched, and eventually found someone I trusted that could help me with this. For months, we worked together, choosing the materials, fabrics and threads to make my doll's body, hair and eyes. A lot of money was spent. But the process helped my mind be in a better place, and the result was so worth it. I was so happy the day I had him in my hands, and since then, he has been my emotional support doll. I don't know if it's strange, but whenever I look at him, I just feel like I can overcome everything. So yes, he's very important to me.

My sister told me maybe it was time for me to let go of him. Again, I told them I could give my niece any other dolls and stuff animals she wanted, just not this one. My niece cried harder, and started screaming. My sister told me I was being an overgrown child, that I needed to act my age and stop clinging to a toy. It ended with her leaving with my still crying niece, telling me that I needed to prioritize my family over a doll.

125,1fceq0q,AITA for getting scooped up by another woman in front of my wife.,"So my wife (F42) asked me (M43) to ask the group since we differ on opinions if I'm the ""A"" hole in this situation. It happened a long while ago (about 15 years now) and I haven't been able to live it down.

It was around Halloween and I had taken my wife to a county fair (Del Mar, San Diego if anyone has been) that has a haunted house that is locally pretty famous for being scary. She was really excited to go, but is super terrified of anything horror. Especially if it has to do with clowns. Regardless she was talking tough and assured me that this was going to be fun and not going to be a thing. I'm usually the type to laugh at horror movies and haunted stuff and so i easily obliged.

So we're going through the haunted house and it's a lot of fun. They let us go in small groups of 6 or 8 if i remember. Most of us were couples. Anyway, It's dark. Strobes are popping. Fog machines were blowing. The props were awesome. The audio effects were really good and spooky. The actors were pretty convincing and there were plenty of them.

My wife is behind me, using me as a shield. Anytime something scary happens she has a particular... squeak? squeal? I dont know to describe it. Regardless, she was behind me, holding onto my hoodie. At one point she was pulling down the hood, which started to choke me from her yanking so hard, so I had to re-direct her hands to the bottom of the back of my hoodie. Now that I think about it, everyone was behind me. I was the front of the group.

Halfway through, an actor dressed up like the possessed girl from the exorcist jumps out from her hiding spot and starts to run at us from a distance cutting off our way through the haunted house. I immediately hear screams (from our group) and feel my wife snatch my arm with a vice like grip and run. When I say run, I mean like Forrest Gump hucking it through the corn fields. I get dragged past the exorcist girl thru the next set of corridors and out a side door. I'm laughing the entire time because I never thought my wife would have such a strong reaction to a haunted house. Especially after all the tough talking she had done before going in. Once we get outside and who i thought was my wife turns around, I'm like ""oh shit"". It was someone else's girl.

I immediately turn around and go back through the haunted house and search for my wife. I make it through the proper end of the haunted house and there she is standing there, foot tapping with her hands on her hips. She was standing next to the boyfriend/husband of the other girl waiting for us to come out. I thought the situation was hilarious and was laughing while telling them what had happened and apologized while I was at it. The other dude laughed as well and found the humor in it. I told him where I left his partner. My wife rolled her eyes, was elegant enough to brush it off and we continued our nite...

Anyway, she still brings up this story till today.  
(1) She thinks that Im a jerk for running off with another person's significant other  
(2) I keep trying to tell her that I thought it was her which she says is BS and asked me to post the story here to see what you all think.

So guys... AITA?

Update: So my wife has seen my post. Her response was ""Way to tell it in a way that makes me seem like the asshole"" which I responded, ""I only had my POV to tell the story from.

My wife is behind me, using me as a shield. Anytime something scary happens she has a particular... squeak? squeal? I dont know to describe it. Regardless, she was behind me, holding onto my hoodie. At one point she was pulling down the hood, which started to choke me from her yanking so hard, so I had to re-direct her hands to the bottom of the back of my hoodie. Now that I think about it, everyone was behind me. I was the front of the group.

Halfway through, an actor dressed up like the possessed girl from the exorcist jumps out from her hiding spot and starts to run at us from a distance cutting off our way through the haunted house. I immediately hear screams (from our group) and feel my wife snatch my arm with a vice like grip and run. When I say run, I mean like Forrest Gump hucking it through the corn fields. I get dragged past the exorcist girl thru the next set of corridors and out a side door. I'm laughing the entire time because I never thought my wife would have such a strong reaction to a haunted house. Especially after all the tough talking she had done before going in. Once we get outside and who i thought was my wife turns around, I'm like ""oh shit"". It was someone else's girl.

I immediately turn around and go back through the haunted house and search for my wife. I make it through the proper end of the haunted house and there she is standing there, foot tapping with her hands on her hips. She was standing next to the boyfriend/husband of the other girl waiting for us to come out. I thought the situation was hilarious and was laughing while telling them what had happened and apologized while I was at it. The other dude laughed as well and found the humor in it. I told him where I left his partner. My wife rolled her eyes, was elegant enough to brush it off and we continued our nite...

Anyway, she still brings up this story till today.  
(1) She thinks that Im a jerk for running off with another person's significant other  
(2) I keep trying to tell her that I thought it was her which she says is BS and asked me to post the story here to see what you all think.

So guys... AITA?

Update: So my wife has seen my post. Her response was ""Way to tell it in a way that makes me seem like the asshole"" which I responded, ""I only had my POV to tell the story from. You're more than welcome to post your side of the story and see what they  say"". Then we laughed it off... so you guys might get a treat and see a post from her.",0.0,1.0490282773971558,1,0
126,1fcep69,AITA for not inviting my stepmom (the woman my dad had an affair with) to my small wedding?,"My dad and stepmom (feels so weird to call her that) got married in earlier this year. 

They met when I was in HS and she was my parents‚Äô foreign language teacher. She is about 10 years older than me, and became a foreign language tutor for me, too. Really, she was a conversation partner and I thought we were on friendly terms.

Not as friendly as she and my dad! After 20+ years with my mom, he had an emotional affair with the other woman. This is so much more complicated because when my parents were in counseling, I was diagnosed with cancer (in college at this point) and they separated so one could care for me, while the other stayed home with my sibling. I‚Äôm talking North America - Asia time difference. 

The short of it is that my dad continued his affair, eventually living with the other woman while my parents‚Äô divorce was finalized. 

I was angry and hurt for a while, but had a good talk with my dad several years ago. My takeaways were that he shared he was finally happy (ouch), sorry he hurt me and my sibling in the process, and was unapologetic for the affair. He loved her. When invited to visit them in Africa (where they then lived), I shared I was uncomfortable being around her. We have tentatively kept in touch since then.

Fast forward to this week, when my fianc√© and I sent save the dates to our small wedding. We are limited to 25 people, and I agonized over inviting my dad. Ultimately, I decided it was my choice and ideally would like celebrating with him. He asked if the invite extended to my stepmom. I said no, just him. Honestly, I was shocked he even asked. My fianc√© was mad.
 
Then, today, he sent me a long message about how he was hurt that my stepmom was not invited, because she is meaningful to him. He said he‚Äôd like to talk after the wedding about any unresolved feelings I have about the divorce and a way to connect moving forward, including her. 

I was flabbergasted! My sibling is unwilling to even say the other woman‚Äôs name. We were both invited to their wedding, however I said no because of distance and cost ($3500 & 35hr of travel just for the flights). Another part of me would have been deeply uncomfortable to be there. 

My fianc√© and I made a lot of hard decisions when finalizing our wedding list. We heard repeated advice to do whatever we wanted, whatever was best for us, because it was our special day. 

Now, I‚Äôm feeling guilty?? For not inviting a woman I haven‚Äôt spoken to in six years?? 

I‚Äôll add that she has never tried reaching out to me. Even when I was sick. I know she knew I had cancer - my dad was actively cheating then.

128,1fcdzzk,AITAH For Not Buzzing In My Neighbors Annoying Dad,"**UPDATE POSTED IN COMMENTS**

 So recently my neighbors father (from what my boyfriend has told me) has been getting let into the building by my boyfriend so that he can care for his disabled son at night. Usually I have no problem with letting anyone in since any delivery service (UPS, Amazon,etc) rings my buzzer because they think that my apartment is the building management office; so I seen no problem with him continuing to help him. That was until it became an everyday occurrence, that happened multiple times throughout. 
   You see, the guy just doesn‚Äôt ring the bell and that‚Äôs it. No, he yells, ‚Äúhey, *apartment number*!‚Äù and then rings and holds the bell down because he doesn‚Äôt know the difference between the door clicking and the voice function being used. When it happened twice in one day I was like, maybe he forgot his key. After the third I was like, this is guy is forgetful!
On the fifth I was like, nobody‚Äôs that fucking forgetful. 
  So I asked my boyfriend what‚Äôs with the guy and if he has a key to the door. My boyfriend explained that he doesn‚Äôt and that the son told him that he gives the key to his nurse in the morning so she can take care of his needs and at night his dad gets in however he can (the son is fully disabled).  Now I understand that the son has his reasons for not making a key for his father but it‚Äôs like damn dude. I‚Äôm a quiet person, most of my neighbors never seen me even on my days off because I like to go unnoticed. I do my good deeds when it‚Äôs needed most; like bringing in packages that are left outside when it rains or bringing in someone‚Äôs Fresh order because groceries are too expensive to be stolen. But an introverted girl can only take so much, and I want to be able to watch my ohc in peace. So AMIAH?

**Important details that may answer questions:
1. I don‚Äôt leave my blinds open but my window is open because it‚Äôs hot af in these old ass apartments 

2. No I haven‚Äôt interacted with or seen the dad/son. And if I have seen them I wouldn‚Äôt say anything to them because I don‚Äôt speak to anyone unless spoken to (I hate unnecessary human interaction)

3. My lights are usually off and so is my tv. Electric is high and I‚Äôm poor so I usually live like bats although I am horribly visually impaired. 

4. I‚Äôve talked to my boyfriend and for right now I‚Äôm ignoring it unless there are signs that give away that we are awake.

She won‚Äôt sleep in any of the other three rooms because one of them is being used as a junk room (she just throws old junk in there) and the others are upstairs and she doesn‚Äôt want to walk up and down the stairs to sleep so she sleeps in the living room and whenever I tell her she needs to atleast put her clothes in the living room she just says ‚Äúit‚Äôs my house and I‚Äôm not gonna be told where I can store my clothes‚Äù. None of the reasons that she can‚Äôt have her own room where she can sleep in a bed and have a place to store her clothes are my fault. It‚Äôs annoying of how she always walks into my room so she can have clothes and then she leaves my door open when I tell her all the time to keep it closed because we have eight animals that will make a mess in my room.

134,1fcctia,AITA for asking him to cancel a trip. ,"I've been with my boyfriend for three years, and sometimes it feels like I'm not a priority. We‚Äôve talked about it before, and recently, he made a real effort to improve things. But now idk..

We discussed our upcoming days off, and I even took PTO so we could hang out since our schedules rarely align. But, he just told me he booked a trip with his friends to Miami for the same time I requested off for us. He didn‚Äôt mention his plans until after it was booked, even though we had talked about spending that day together. He did mention wanting to take another guys trip but he never said when but I assumed it was a different time since we discuss the days months prior and earlier that day when he booked the trip. He claimed that he forgot but how did he forget when we just spoke about it maybe an hour prior to him booking the trip?! 

He said he had until November 2nd to cancel, so I thought he might, but then told me he had no intention of doing so. They just came back from a guys' trip to Mexico (last month), and this isn‚Äôt the first time something like this has happened. When I asked him to cancel, he questioned why he should, which hurt since I went out of my way to take time off and unfortunately my schedule isn't as flexible as it used to be. We had discussed this earlier, but he still booked the trip. I feel like I always come second to his friends and family, and while I get he has his own life, it seems like I‚Äôm the one always adjusting, not him.

I'm not sure if I'm in the wrong here but I'm open to hearing people's perspectives on this. Pls be easy on me lol. Thanks in advance.


Update: hi guys, I'm really grateful for the feedback! I just want to clarify that we do not live together and we do spend as much time as we can together, it's just frustrating to see that he made the mistake and he isn't taking accountability for it but instead is expecting me to reschedule the dates we had discussed. But yeah the responses have been really helpful for me so thank you again! ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-09,"AITA for asking him to cancel a trip.

135,1fcceyw,AITAH for telling my mom to put my cousins back in foster care?,"9 years ago my uncle passed away leaving his wife- M- and their boys: R (30), J (18), A (17), C & L (13), E (11). M was a SAHM so once my uncle was gone they mostly lived on gov assist. M quickly fell into drug use, & the younger 5 were taken from their M & placed in the system. 

R's gf came into some money after a serious accident. They bought house & took in all the kids. Family offered to raise the kids but R refused. He had them for 7 years & refused all help

But they were returned to their mom. J left to live w/ his GF's family, A moved back w/ R he had a baby. The younger 3 were removed from M's care after she relapsed, the twins stole a car & tested + for pot (Meth for C), & E was dropped off at my house w/ nothing but a change of clothes/ a tablet. A week later the twins were dropped off too- w/ ankle monitors & 5 outfits between the 2 of them, & C had a huge lump on his neck. My mom bought them all clothes, & E went to live w/ my uncle.

The first 3 weeks were full w/ doctors, dentists, CPS interviews, court hearings, meeting POs and the twins were good. C even got the lump taken care of. But soon they were running away from my grandma in Walmart for 45 minutes- which put them on house arrest. They said slurs, broke game controllers/ calculators/ drawers/ new glasses in a week; physical/ verbal fighting; gaslighting. Jerking off in public spaces. And this is condensed only for the character limit. 

L was slamming glass doors, pushing in a celling vent making it cave in, popping his brothers Get Well Soon balloon, ripped off a shed door. C screaming at his L for any little thing; throwing away over 20 toothbrushes, smoking pot, screaming at my mom over chores. 

CPS comes over often. At the 6 week mark my mom & I talked to her w/ the twins. We told her about the gaslighting, yelling, & verbal abuse. The twins then did all three of those things in front of CPS. I said I am scared to leave for school because I don't want her alone w/ them, but I don't want them to be abused by strangers. My mom & I broke down so much that the CPS worker said that she had never seen a foster family break down like we did, & that the twins need higher care. We got them on meds & things got better. They are not forced to take the meds and are happier on it. But they are still fighting and breaking things. The twins use the excuse that they want to be w/ their mom/ that they were abused by their brother. But that is our fault. They see their mom once a week. They are not abused here. 

These boys are in therapy, have tutors; play football; have a chore/reward list; free trips to see E. My mom had spent over 5k on them in 3 months. We teach them to cook/clean/bathe. Their mother went to rehab/got a new place. And they still fight/break things. 

My mom has to drink every night to just to sleep & missed 127 hours of work. These boys have done nothing but make our lives worse and we cant take care of them.

136,1fccaye,AITA for refusing to pay back my mother?,"Context,

I am a college student paying out of pocket to go to college. all the money I save up during summer and winter break at my job goes towards paying my tuition, no one assists me in paying my tuition and I don't get financial aid.

and I make it clear to everyone in my family to not ask me for any money because I will say no as I need every cent to pay for my tuition.

Recently my mother told me that she decided to buy a new car and replace her old one that she bought in 2013.

Before she bought said new car, I asked her if I could have her old car so my commute to college from home would be easier.

She said yes and left me her old car while she got a new one, and the topic of paying for the old car was never brought up.

The day she came home with said new car, she told me two things

1. she had put me on her car insurance and I was expected to pay her $100 every month
2. she spent $800 on brand new tires for the old car and expects me to pay her back ASAP

I was irritated to say the least, as I never told her to do either of these things, I even explicitly said you don't have to do anything besides sign it over to me, and that I will take care of maintaining the car when I have the money.

To make matters worse, she did this right after I had finished paying my college tuition and thus have no money, like none whatsoever, and now I suddenly owe her $800 that I'm incapable of paying her back, on top of what is essentially a new monthly bill.

I outright told her that same day I cannot afford that because I just finished paying my tuition and she told me if I want the car, I need to pay her back for the tires. It feels like she wanted me to pay for the car, but knew I was going to say no and instead I would recommend she sell the car to someone else, so she did this instead.

I am very grateful for being given the car, but I'm also resentful of the situation I'm in as this could not have come at a worse time and I really want her tell to just take the car back and sell it in spite of how much easier it's made commuting to school.

Cause I simply don't make enough to pay what she's demanding of me, much less now that college has start back up again.

So Am I the Asshole here for not wanting to pay my mother back?

UPDATE:

So following the advice given by others, I spoke with my mother and told her to take back the car as I'm unable to give her the money she wants for it and she's better off selling it to someone who can.

and she cut me off before I could finish, she told me to keep the car and she doesn't want it back, that she doesn't actually need the money and she was just trying to teach me a lesson because she doesn't like that I spent all my money on paying my college tuition.

The rep tells him the MFA info is available on the intranet and he says ‚Äúso you‚Äôre telling me to go to the portal I can‚Äôt log into? How does that make sense?‚Äù And the guy tells him he can email him the info and he says ‚Äúto the email I can‚Äôt log into? Do you hear what you‚Äôre saying?‚Äù 

I go back outside and finish dinner. I‚Äôm  steaming because I worked in a call center when I graduated college and he is the stereotypical asshole caller. 

I come back inside and ask him if he was is done being an asshole to the help desk rep. I told him he is perpetuating the stereotype that all doctors ate entitled assholes and he says ‚Äúmaybe I am.‚Äù Fair enough, we are sassy gays, but don‚Äôt make this guys day hard because you don‚Äôt have the info he needs to verify you. I point to his lanyard and ask him, ‚Äúyou just got home from the hospital, aren‚Äôt you wearing your badge? Did you even look at it for an ID number?‚Äù And he said ‚ÄúI just want to focus on (my notes)‚Äù

It‚Äôs important to note that he is sitting at the dining room table and I set two places where he is NOT working. I open the bottle of wine and start pouring the glasses. I pick up the steak with my hands and drop it on his plate. I pick up the corn and drop it on his plate. He says ‚Äúboy bye I don‚Äôt have time for your attitude‚Äù and goes upstairs. 

So, Reddit, please tell me. Am I the ass hole for standing up for the help desk rep who was just following security protocol?",2.0,0.04665468633174896,0,0
