0,1fdlzl9,AITA for telling my best friend to call off her wedding? UPDATE,"OG: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f10dlw/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_best\_friend\_she\_should\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f10dlw/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_she_should_call/)

Hi everyone. Everything exploded after I made this post so I thought I would update.

A few days after Daisy cut me off she showed up on my doorstep, bag in hand, completely distraught. She came inside, and some hugging and crying, calmed down enough to tell me that Max had found out, they'd gotten in a massive argument, and Max went to his brother's for the night. 

Apparently, one of Daisy's friends who was at the party, Georgia (24F), told her boyfriend Greg (27M), one of Max's groomsmen who then called Max and told him everything - how Daisy had hidden the pregnancy, she'd told everyone else at the party,and how she was going to surprise him AFTER the wedding. Max was pissed at her, saying they weren't in a financially good place since they'd just spent a lot of money on the wedding and the honeymoon, he couldn't believe she didn't tell him but she told everyone else. He felt betrayed and said he 'didn't even recognise' her. Daisy was a mess, even saying she should've listened to me. 

She stayed at my place over the next few days while Max got his space. During that time she had about a dozen missed calls and texts from friends and family; guess word spread fast. She mostly slept and tried to distract herself. After about a week Max called her saying he wanted to talk, so she went back to their place. Long story short, Max called off the wedding for now. Apparently he said he wasn't comfortable enough in the relationship to get married as planned because it was a massive breach of trust, and that he'd rather postpone and work things out. As of now whether they'll get married in the future is up in the air. They're still together and are having conversations about the pregnancy and having children. Daisy hasn't told me much more than that; she sort of dropped off the face of the Earth for most of us since this happened. I think she's focusing on Max. Our friendship is fine, but definitely not the same. I still wish Daisy the best after everything, and for those of you interested, I still stand by my decision. 

After reading everyone's comments and thinking a lot about what happened, I don't regret communicating to her how I felt. Maybe telling her to call it all off was a bit much, I can admit that, but I'm still glad I said something. Also, to everyone saying I want to sleep with Max: I'm a lesbian, but that was a cute hypothesis. ",UPDATE,2024-09-10,"AITA for telling my best friend to call off her wedding?

1,1fdi8q9,AITA for telling my Dad I don’t care if he’s absent at my wedding?,"For some backstory:
I (F24) have a rough relationship with my dad’s (M43) wife, E (F41). They got together in 2006, married in 2011, and have had two children since then. 

E has never liked me. I was introduced to her when I was 7 and things were instantly sour. She was mean, snarky and had no interest in me whatsoever. Now, as an adult, I can tolerate her behaviour (which has gotten significantly worse as I’ve grown up and began to talk back). The issue lies with the fact that my dad has always allowed it. I’m a grown woman and can handle myself now, as I’ve been doing for years, but when I was a child, he had nothing to say about her borderline abusive behaviour and will find ways to change the subject/excuse it whenever it’s brought up. This has significantly damaged our relationship, and we’re low-contact as of now.

So, I’m getting married in November this year to J (M25). We’ve been together for 11 years. E is insistent that she will be there. She will not. I have made this clear since we got engaged in November 2023. My dad is invited, but I made it plainly clear last year that she wasn’t welcome as a result of her behaviour, attitude, and treatment of the both of us.

*It’s worth mentioning here that J also doesn’t want E present as she is discriminatory - J is trans (FTM) and E will deadname him, make comments about it all, and is overall hateful. He is also defensive of me given that he has been with me for the majority of E’s treatment.

So; my dad met with me last week and told me that if E wasn’t present at my wedding, he wouldn’t be either. I honestly expected something like this to happen, so I said that it was fine. He was confused and asked me to elaborate, so I explained that he didn’t have to attend, but it meant that I would never speak to him again, that I had dealt with him choosing E over me for almost 20 years and that my wedding (of his first and only daughter) being a subject of debate was the final straw. He said nothing for a moment afterwards and then got up and left. E has been blowing up my phone with explicit texts but it’s been radio silence from my Dad since our chat. 

As I said - I’ve dealt with E’s treatment, and by extension, my dad’s silence for almost two decades. My wedding feels like a good place to finally end this all, to start over. I don’t see a way to fix this, or our relationship, as long as he’s with E.

2,1fd8t6z,AITA (19F) for using my parents health insurance when I didn't have any other choice?,"Ok so to preface this with a few details I have just moved out a month ago from what is basically a collage dorm off campus in state in Utah and my parent are very mormon.

About two years ago I fully came to the realization that I was transgender (MTF) and started going to therapy for it and was paying fully privately out of my own pocket. About a year ago. when I was originally going to come out to my family and was still living at home, my mother had cleaned my room and found my bra. When I got home we sat down and talked and she said that what I was going through was just as phase and that I was ""god child"" and that ""god doesn't make mistakes."" I was lucky that she didn't tell my dad at the time as he is a very big Republican and conspiracy theorist, like when I brought up that Alex Jones was on trial for what he said about Sandy Hook he said,""I can see how that could be."" I went back into the closet for about another month until, through therapy I was able to come back out of the closet but at that time my family was a lot more open with their political views and what they thought about trans people.

Half way through this year I decided that I was going to move out and start HRT. After searching for a while I was able to find a doctor that was near by that specialized in gender affirming care and scheduled an appointment. When I went there I didn't know what the price would be until I got there and my card got declined. I asked to know how much the appointment was and it was about $500. Was worried that I got all this way for nothing and decided to use my parents insurance which I am currently under. It was through my Moms work and it would just be seen as Hormone Affirming Therapy and not as transgender care so I thought she wouldn't know. There was still a copay of about $250 dollars that I paid out of pocket and it was the same for the medicine that I had prescribed. Since then I had been dreading that my parents would find out and today they did.

Today when I was in class I got a text from my mom asking if I was seeing a new doctor and if I was seeing them for hormone affirming care. At this point I knew I was screwed and, after my girlfriend came over for emotional support (she only heard my side of the conversation), I called my mom. I told her the truth and hoped for the best but sadly it was the opposite. She told me that she loved me and I would always be her son but that if I was going to continue on this route she would not support me and I would have to either pay for my own insurance or she would kick me off of the family's. I feel bad for using her insurance but with the uncertanty of whether or not I would be able to get it in the future made me scared so I used it.

3,1fdvmtw,AITA for Not Letting My Son See His grandparents After They Said He Should Be Ashamed of His Black Features? ,"I (M28) Am half Black and half Mexican, and I have a 5-year-old son with my ex-girlfriend, who’s Korean. Our relationship ended a while ago, but we’ve always tried to co-parent and keep things civil for the sake of our son. Lately, though, something has been bothering me. My son has started acting more self-conscious, especially about his appearance. He’s got my curly hair and darker skin, and it seemed like he was starting to feel uncomfortable with the way he looks.

A few weeks ago, I figured out why. During a visit to his mother’s parents—his Korean grandparents—I overheard them telling him he should be ashamed of his Black features. They told him he’d be ""more handsome"" if he looked more Korean and suggested that when he’s older, he should straighten his hair and stay out of the sun so his skin doesn’t get darker.

I was furious. My son is only 5, and for him to hear that from his own family is unacceptable. I confronted his grandparents immediately, and they tried to excuse it, saying they were ""helping"" him because life would be easier if he looked ""less Black."" I told them that’s racist and harmful, especially for a young kid who’s still figuring out who he is.

When I got home, I called my ex and told her what happened. I said that her parents were no longer allowed to see our son until they changed their attitude. She wasn’t happy about it. She agrees that what they said was wrong, but she doesn’t think cutting them off is the solution. She says our son should still know his Korean family and culture, and that her parents might change if given a chance.

Now, my son keeps asking why he can’t see his grandparents, and my ex is mad at me. She says I’m being too extreme and that I’m making things harder for our son by keeping him away from part of his family. But I don’t want him around people who will make him feel ashamed of his Black heritage, even if they are family.

Am I the asshole for not letting my son see his grandparents after what they said?

4,1fdvdl1,AITA for being angry my parents gave money to my brother while asking from me ?,"I have a twin brother (we are both 26) and I feel angry and disappointed my parents gave him a lot of money and help, while asking money from me.

After high school, I studied computer science and got a god job in my field, which is paying pretty well.

My brother studied arts and after almost 2 years of not being able to find a job in the field, my father paid 10k for me brother to get a new qualification in a different field and helped him get hired by a family friend. My brother was supposed to pay back the 10k from his salary,  but my parents decided to forget about it.

When I wanted to get a master degree, my parents discouraged me because it's too expensive (25k), but they asked me to give them the 25k so they can sell their apartament and buy a nicer one with all the money. I refused and they don't miss any opportunity to make me feel guilty about this.

This year I finally managed to get an appointment after I saved up for years for the down payment. I'll have to repay the loan for the next 30 years and my parents didn't contributed with anything. They said they will help me to pay it faster, but apparently they never have any money left at the end of the month. Which is fine, it's my responsibility.

But now, my brother wants to buy an apartment and my parents offered to take a loan to help him with the down payment and furnishing the place. 

AITA for feeling like this is unfair and being angey with them. I know it's their money and they can do whatever, but they have 2 children. Last month my father asked me for 5k because he ""didn't had any other option"", but when my brother needs money, he can magically take a loan.

6,1fdv6w4,AITA for Refusing to be my Brother's Best Man at His Wedding After He Made That Decision Without Telling Me?,"I (28m) have a contentious relationship with my older brother (31m). As kids, he would regularly bully me and generally be obnoxious to me. As adults, he often refuses to respect my personal space and boundaries whenever I see him, in addition to frequently saying things or sharing social media posts in our family group text that are racist, homophobic, transphobic, ablest, or any other kind of ""-ist"" or ""phobic"" adjective you could think of. As a result, I try to limit my exposure to him, and dread any situations where I'm forced to spend time with him.



He got engaged to his girlfriend a little under 2 years ago, and they and my dad and step-mom have been planning their wedding ever since. The wedding is scheduled for the end of this month, and is 18 days away as of when I post this. As his brother, I knew that I would have to be one of his groomsmen, and I was fine with that. I also fully expected one of his close childhood friends to be his best man considering I don't have (or want) a close relationship with him. I've been under this impression for almost the past year, until I heard from my (biological) mom about a week ago that the Best Man duties were going to be shared between me and my younger half-brother.



I called my dad about this, and he confirmed that my younger brother and I would split best man responsibilities at the wedding. I've been pretty mentally checked out regarding the wedding for the past few months, in addition to sorting out my mental health, so I brushed the whole situation off as me just not remembering when we talked about this being the plan.... until a few days ago when I was messaging a long-distance friend, looked back through our chat history, and saw a part of a convo where I was talking about the wedding with them, and explicitly saying that one of my brother's friends was going to be the Best Man. This message was from 7 months ago.



I called my dad again about this, and he said that me and my younger brother being the Best Men had been the plan the whole time, and that I have to do it because I'm his brother and it's tradition. Again, I don't like my brother, and I don't want to be his Best Man, and if I was asked, I would absolutely say no.



So now I'm feeling gaslit about this entire situation. I have no memory of ever having a conversation with any member of my family where they asked me to be the best man, and not only does it feel more like I'm being told to be it, but this is being dropped on me barely within a month of the wedding itself. For a decision made months ago, I assumed I would've been talked to about it far, FAR sooner than 2.5 weeks before.



So with all of these factors in mind, AITA for adamantly telling my family that I'm not going to be one of the best men at my brother's wedding?

I've been under this impression for almost the past year, until I heard from my (biological) mom about a week ago that the Best Man duties were going to be shared between me and my younger half-brother.



I called my dad about this, and he confirmed that my younger brother and I would split best man responsibilities at the wedding. I've been pretty mentally checked out regarding the wedding for the past few months, in addition to sorting out my mental health, so I brushed the whole situation off as me just not remembering when we talked about this being the plan.... until a few days ago when I was messaging a long-distance friend, looked back through our chat history, and saw a part of a convo where I was talking about the wedding with them, and explicitly saying that one of my brother's friends was going to be the Best Man. This message was from 7 months ago.



I called my dad again about this, and he said that me and my younger brother being the Best Men had been the plan the whole time, and that I have to do it because I'm his brother and it's tradition. Again, I don't like my brother, and I don't want to be his Best Man, and if I was asked, I would absolutely say no.



So now I'm feeling gaslit about this entire situation. I have no memory of ever having a conversation with any member of my family where they asked me to be the best man, and not only does it feel more like I'm being told to be it, but this is being dropped on me barely within a month of the wedding itself. For a decision made months ago, I assumed I would've been talked to about it far, FAR sooner than 2.5 weeks before.



So with all of these factors in mind, AITA for adamantly telling my family that I'm not going to be one of the best men at my brother's wedding? I'm fine with still being a groomsmen (since that was communicated to me in a timely manner), but I absolutely do not want to be a part of their uncoordinated dysfunction any more than I already have to.",0.0,0.0012159578036516905,0,1
7,1fdv3mc,AITA for not going to my best friends birthday because my ex-friend is also going?,"I (F17) just entered college, and I’m trying to leave my high school drama behind except I’m put into situations where I can’t.

My ex-friend (F19), *Nicole* had bipolar and early in our friendship I found her very negative and draining. She manipulated her boyfriend into isolating himself for her and got mad whenever he talked to other girls after they broke up. Nicole would insult these girls for no reason and ended up disliking half the school for trivial reasons.

She even thought negatively about her friends. Once, I carpooled with a mutual friend to the beach without her, and she immediately assumed we were talking behind her back. Then, when I unknowingly became close with some people she didn’t like, she got upset, calling me fake. I said I wasn’t going to stop being friends with people just because she didn’t like them, but she blew up on me.

We never resolved this, and I think she was always waiting for something else to happen. 

At some point, one day Nicole began to ignore me entirely. Idk what I said or did, but she was over it. I was confused at first, thinking she’d eventually talk to me about whatever was bothering her, but weeks passed and she grew petty, interrupting me whenever I spoke and telling others to comment hateful things on my social media. After a few weeks of this, I talked to other friends who had similar experiences with her and realized how badly she had treated me. I also reflected on how her negativity brought out the worst in me, like when she insisted we call a guy she had a crush on “Fatboy,” which made me uncomfortable at first but later became routine.

Over time, we mutually ignored each other. I made new friends and felt much better without her negativity. I stayed close with my previous friends, even if there were odd moments, like when Nicole would see our friend *Isabella* at my house and accuse her of betrayal, or when Isabella posted a picture with me and Nicole commented “LMFAO.” I was over it, but Nicole was still childish.

I wanted nothing to do with her. So sometimes they’d hang out with her and other times they’d hang out with me. Nicole eventually told Isabella that she forgot why she was mad and wanted to hang out again without awkwardness. I was shocked Isabella would even suggest this. I got really upset and told Isabella I felt disgusted she would even say that. 

Now it’s Isabella’s 19th birthday on Friday, and she invited both of us. I thought I could set aside my discomfort with other friends there but I’m not sure I can handle the stress of being around Nicole for hours. I don't want to make Isabella sad either...

Obviously I wasn't happy about the situation and the guy has straight on spot admitted to it being his fault, he tried to get me to agree with on him to pay HALF of my bill and he would pay his own out of his own pocket for his car. First of all it was not my fault so why should I pay half? Now before we exchanged details I told him I'm most likely going to make a claim. Later that day at work I have spoke to my collages and we decided the best action would be to claim with insurance, throughout the day I been getting messages from this guy (as we exchanged numbers) almost every hour to reconsider putting in a claim and he would pay half of the damage, then he proceeds to send me second hand bumpers for my car make to what I was just thinking to myself?? ""Why would I go for a second hand/from damaged vehicle part""
After I finished work I have messaged him back that I have put the claim through and that will be it, he carried on pushing me to cancel my claim to the point he said he would ""get his body work specialist to do it for me"" I have simply told him I will have my mechanic give me a quote and if he is happy with the price I will cancel my claim.
His amount of almost threatening pushing makes me want to block him/ignore him and let the claim go through, am i the asshole tho?

We have talked about a similar situation before and he was ok with the ratio of double the amt of girls to guys, I brought this up but he said it only applied to casual hang out not a concert, party or rave. I then out of annoyance asked him when am I allowed to go out then? For the past year I have only gone out with friends an amount I can count on my fingers, maybe even one hand, and every single one of those times he has either argued against it before hand, blow up my phone with calls and texts while I'm there threatening to show up, and/or argue afterwards why I shouldn't have gone. My friends include a good amount of guys that I have know since elementary school and my bf knows this too and knows about them, and at the hangouts it's never only guys, it is a mixed group, and it is never a party, only getting food or a birthday. I have rarely hung out with friends since I started dating him and I always jump at the chance when people invite me because I barely see anyone. He tends to say I chose them over him but I talk to him every day and hang out with him whenever possible. And the the past 5 months I have seen my friends about 3 times.

Besides just hanging out, I have never been to a concert before, this would be my first time and it's a close by concert from an artist i like and going with a close friend.

Now, I was a bit removed from the whole process—my wife was handling the communication, and I trusted her and her parents to work it out. So imagine my surprise when I find out that they didn’t send the money directly through a bank transfer or anything easy like that. Instead, they used a money transfer service that ended up charging them around a 10% fee. That means we only received less than £2700.

To be honest, I was pretty frustrated. We’re already strapped for cash, and part of the reason we asked them was to avoid taking out a loan or dealing with extra fees. But now, we’re basically out £300 for no reason! I understand they were trying to help, but wouldn’t it have made more sense to just transfer the money? This feels like the same or worse as just getting a loan from the bank. I’m not saying I’m not grateful for their help, but the way they went about it feels inefficient and unnecessarily costly. Why couldn’t they have either sent it through a cheaper service or just transferred the full amount directly to our bank account? I don't hate them nor I think they did it in bad faith. It's not that. But if they would have asked me or my wife, we could have find a different service that lets you send money internationally for like £20 per transaction. I used them before, my wife used them before too. It's just the fact that an extra £250 could have paid for a lot of things in a new home.

I brought this up to my wife, and she got defensive, saying, “They did their best,” and that I should just be grateful we got anything at all. But honestly, I’m annoyed. We didn’t ask for help just to end up back in the same situation because of some unnecessary fee. Am I supposed to just say thanks and act like this didn’t set us back even more? I felt it was reasonable to question this since we’re borrowing the money and will pay it back. However, my wife believes I overstepped by even thinking of bringing it up with her parents and is upset with me for making it an issue.

Am I the asshole for prioritizing the money over maintaining peace, and potentially putting my wife in an awkward position with her parents? Maybe I should’ve just let it go, considering they were trying to help us out.

17,1fdt4no,"AITA for Refusing to be a Pallbearer, or ATTA for Uninviting Me","A short while ago my relative passed away. Due to familial connection I was asked to be a Pallbearer through a 3rd party, my Mother. I am not particularly close with my family, especially my extended family. The amount of information I know about the passed individual is scarce to say the least. None of this is the issue, but background.

The blocker for me is that my family including the extended family is all fairly devoutly Catholic. I am however an atheist and have been since I was a teenager, secret from them until I was able to support myself. Still likely a bit of 'untold information' from a lot of the extended family. Not secret, but not often spoken of.

So the reason I declined was simple, I don't want to be a part of any Catholic or religious anything ever again. Since the Pallbearer is a part of the ceremony, I don't want to do it. I told my mother and father I was happy to still attend and sit with the rest of the family, but I would not participate.

My Father just accepted this. He is likely hurt being the closest relative to the deceased. Though that wasn't my intention it was a shitty consequence. My mother has tried to change my mind with some guilt-trips and ""all your doing is carrying the casket"". While that is the only thing I would be ""doing"" aside from sitting through the rest of the Catholic schtick, it is still an official role in the Catholic ceremony, so hard ""no"" from me.

This all sucks, and if AITA for this alone I can understand at least partially. Religion is something I am admittedly harsh towards, so maybe I am wrong.

However, it doesn't end there. I am told since I won't participate, I am uninvited. Or rather ""it would be rude to refuse and still come"". So rather than be rude my Mother wants to save face by me not coming at all. This is where I think things have definitely turned the other direction and they are the assholes. The family is mostly being told it is because I am sick, which is true but not the real reason.

Unrelated but something that did upset me - I will be listed as a Pallbearer for the diocese program and the town newsletter no matter what.

To family members that might find this: Yeah I'm the shitty son, you don't need to remind me.

EDIT:

So far most of responses are IATA, which I am willing to accept, but not for the majority of the reasons people are giving, if they are giving any reason at all. I am more inclined at this stage to agree with those saying ESH.

I am not trying to be an asshole in my responses (with one notable exception). Ultimately I am treating this as a debate and maybe that is the problem. I am trying to find why I am supposedly the asshole here, and when you just say ""YTA"" and don't tell me why, that doesn't add anything. Your opinions are great, but in order actually understand I need reasons. I thought that was the entire point of this sub. I am asking clarifying questions, if that makes me an asshole then we have lost the thread.

For clarification purposes:

1. Being a pallbearer is not religious, I understand that. The service at which I would be a pallbearer, is. You can't just separate the action from its context without a reason, and I haven't been given one. It being common and every religion having it doesn't make it not religious. Everyone saying it isn't religious doesn't make it not religious.
2. Participation is my line. I am willing to physically be there and support my family, I am not willing to participate in their rituals. Physically being in the church isn't crossing a line because I am not doing anything, and that doing nothing doesn't publicly name me as a part of the church. Being a pallbearer does. Publicly and in writing. I don't see that as a particularly hypocritical or wild viewpoint.
3. I want to be there. I know this is not about me. If I thought this was about me, I wouldn't be asking opinions let alone trying to understand them. When I care about something, I try to understand it. If I didn't care, I would not be here at all.
4. To those saying I'm refusing 'simply because I don't feel like it', you either didn't read the whole post or have poor reading comprehension. See #4. I fucking care. Maybe reconsider imagining shitty motivations for others when they are telling you their motivations directly.
5. If it was at all unclear, I am refusing because it goes against my beliefs to take part in religion at all. I believe they are harmful to all society, and refuse to participate actively in it.

If you disagree with any of these points, **great**. Tell me **why**.

Stupid one, but a joke). This sweet girl, sometimes weird I admit, but who isn't? I was happy for him, until things started to go wrong after the first few weeks of the relationship.

There was always an awkward air between them. The girl has already dated, so she has experience. He, however, had nothing. Absolutely nothing. No knowledge about what you should do and what not to do when you are committed to someone. Not to mention the fact that they were terrible at talking even though they both wanted each other. As a result, misunderstandings and mistakes began to unfold.

Despite dating, he never stopped talking about women. He was never afraid to talk about the other women he would like to ""share a moment with."" The type of woman he talked about was the total opposite of his girlfriend. She was brunette, he liked blondes. She was short, he commented on girls the same height as him, and the list would only grow. He never acted on these things tho. He continued dating normally. But as always, they were always kind of awkward around each other. Things started to heat up when they started fighting over several reasons, one of them being an ex who appeared back in her life and the other being the fact that he was continually avoiding spending time with her. An accumulation of problems that appeared during the 3 months that passed during the relationship. I noticed more and more that it wouldn't and SHOULDN'T last.

It is now that the end arrives. I advised him to break up, but he refused. Her being his first girlfriend made him not want to lose her. A little afraid of never having it again. I spoke to her soon after. She said she wanted to try, but I insisted on his mistakes to make her see things. I convinced her and the breakup happened. As expected, he was pissed. We still talk, but it's something that has made our long friendship stumble these last few weeks.

19,1fdsztj,AITA for kicking my mom out of my place even though she has cancer?,"My (26F) spouse (29M) and I welcomed my mother  (58F) into our home in January of this year because she was diagnosed with breast cancer. This is because where we live in Canada, our city has a cancer centre very close by. I work 2 jobs and am the only one being her at home caretaker, ie, making her food, preparing her supplements, administering her medication, doing her laundry, etc. My spouse and I have been together for a little over 3 years, unwed. My mother pays us $700 for rent to cover her expenses (groceries, hygiene products, gas/transportation, utilities). she receives a disability check every month around $1100.

Full disclosure, my mom loves to gamble. She always has and it was a way she bonded with my maternal grandmother. She passed away during COVID. Recently, my mom travelled 9 hours away between chemo treatments back to our home town, without telling me. She went up there to make some money by selling some of her medication and spent it all gambling, including her disability check (I didn’t find this out till later). She lost all her medication and ended up with a dangerous infection, resulting in her being hospitalized and flown back to where we are. I was clearly angry with her and have been upset for weeks. She was stringing me along that her disability check was late and that she would give us her rent money when she has it. By the time we were into the first week of the month, I put my foot down and made sure we called disability together to determine what was going on with the cheque. She screamed and hollered at me to give her the phone and go away, I knew the check was spent. 

Mind you, my spouse has been a rock and so patient throughout this entire ordeal. He opened his home to my mother and let go of many things he holds value to as a young adult with his own place (privacy, organization, peace). He did this for me and her because he’s a good man, but it was under the agreement that she stay focused on her journey, pay her rent, and lay low. She went off on many drug and gambling benders over the summer, but this final dupe was the last straw. She couldn’t even do the one thing my spouse requested of her. So I let her know that she had until the end of the month to find her own place or get assistance from the cancer society. Well the next day was my birthday and I found 5 unauthorized charges on my debit card. Called the bank and it was an online gambling service.

This is where I may be the asshole. I kicked her out indefinitely right then and there and have refused to help her with anything going forward. At this point I’m on the verge of never talking to her again. Am I the asshole for putting her out at a time like this? Would I be the asshole if I never spoke to her again over this? 

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT**
I did call the bank to report fraudulent behaviour and I have voice verification with my bank. I blocked the card and got a new one that day, and all of my accounts and authorizations are either authenticated through password protection, text or email verification. Photos of identification are not considered legitimate here and almost all places require two pieces of physical ID to get a loan, or access to personal information.

I feel confident she is unable to steal my identity because of these verifications and documentation she doesn’t have.

She also had stage 4 thyroid cancer when I was 5 years old. Which is very hard to survive especially after radiation to the neck and brain. She fought very hard because she obviously didn’t want to die but she told me she couldn’t accept that I wouldn’t remember her if she did. She had many health struggles after that, I don’t even know what her original voice sounded like and have never seen my mom eat a steak or similar foods. So feels like a grey area when it comes to NC.

I understand this may seem like an obvious conclusion to some but I feel partly to blame if she dies and at the very least I could help her find a place to live and support her from a distance. Holding this boundary may not make me an asshole but leaving my mother in the lurch to die when there is something I can still do might be..

20,1fdsy9t,AITA for complaining about a minor inconvenience to my friends? ,"So my house is currently being renovated, almost the entire thing. I stayed somewhere else for 2 months so it could get somewhat completed before I got home, and unfortunately I was put in a situation where I had to come home a month and a half before they could finish. So I’ve been living here while it’s being renovated for a couple weeks so far. 

It hasn’t been too bad, but the only real issue I’ve had is the workers keep tracking in mud all over the carpet. This is the carpet I’m keeping, it’s not being replaced. This is a minor inconvenience, although still annoying, and I do have to clean it all up. I’m grateful for the work they’ve been doing, as I’ve been telling my friends, so it’s just an annoying little thing that I have to deal with.

Today was the first time I brought the mud on the carpet up to my friends, and you know, because they’re my friends I thought it would be safe to complain to them. It’s not as if I was saying anything bad about the workers, all I said was “I’m very grateful for the renovation being done, I think things will look awesome in the end, but you best believe the mud they bring in on the carpet is a lot.” 

Suddenly I get piled onto by all my friends, they’re saying things like “you’re acting like a spoiled classist princess” and “you should be more grateful for what you have”, or “the workers aren’t doing that to purposefully inconvenience you, you just sound like a spoiled brat”. 

Like, yah, I know they’re not doing it on purpose, I never said they were..? I never once claimed that. So that comment in particular definitely confused me. The rest were just sort of trying to make me feel bad and throwing insults at me.

Now, something that may be important for me to note is that these friends have always been 1-uppers, in the sense that if anyone complains about anything, they don’t really offer much help and just try to 1-up them. So maybe they’re not the best people to complain to, but I didn’t think I’d get insults thrown at me for it.

Is there something about this situation that I’m not seeing? Maybe what I said went too far, I’m not sure. I’m quite confused to be honest. I thought these people knew me and knew I’m not a ‘classist princess’ as they said, I thought they knew my character better than that…but maybe not.

Anyways, AITA? Is there something I could be missing here? Please let me know in the comments. If there are questions or info missing I’ll be happy to answer.

I told them I would check with my girlfriend because of the new delivery date, I told her about what my friends wanted to do as a gift for becoming a dad and asked if she'd be okay with it since it would be a 3 day trip. She said she wanted to tell her about me turning down the gift because our baby will be born in less than 2 weeks instead of asking her if she'd be okay with me going on this trip. 

She then said she didn't want me here on that weekend because then she'd know I'd be sulking thinking I could be doing something awesome instead of being home with her. I retorted by asking if she wouldn't have thought the same if I had told her I turned it down and asked if it would've been better if I had just not told her anything. She said no because at least that way she would've felt she was more important than a trip.

When they got back from their lesson they obviously came to sit with us so 1 girl sat in the last remaining chair, leaving 2 people to sit on either end. The table is built for 4 people however people can just pull a chair up on either side and still be completely involved in the convo (my gf and 1 other girl had to do this). the other girl did it no bother, pulled up a chair, sat down, and started speaking. my gf however made a deal out of it? asking where she’s meant to sit and when we told her to pull up a chair like the other girl she hesitantly did it and sat with a face in her for the whole period (and for the rest of the day). 

I noticed she was upset and decided to text her after school asking what was wrong ( id noticed she was upset when we all sat down but thought maybe something had happened beforehand) and she explained how we left her to sit on her own at the end of the table and how she felt like she was being left out. i was very confused as it wasn’t just her who had to do this, the other girl did it with no problem. so i told her that she was still sat with the group and that she wasn’t sat alone and she was with the group. she then said how she had apparently asked to move (i didn’t hear this because i would’ve said yes) and i said oh i didn’t hear you and she then blamed me saying i should’ve said something. i cannot see how she’d feel upset about this as she was still sat with us all at the table but chose not to speak out of spite. after this i said i didn’t think she was upset about it to which she told me to “fuck off” and “leave her alone”. this really hurt my feelings as i don’t know what i’ve done wrong.

I (26F) was supposed to start a new job today. But because karma is a bitch, I caught a really bad cold last weekend and I have spent the past 4 days in bed surrounded by tissues and enough meds to open a small pharmacy.

I tried, I really tried to make it go away as fast as possible with tea and my own personal mini pharmacy, but here I was, yesterday evening, shaking and aching in my bed, with perhaps 4 hours of sleep in me because sleeping with a stuffy nose and a sore throat is practically impossible.

So I called the HR employee I had been in contact with to explain my situation (though I didn’t need to explain much, she could clearly hear how sick I was from her end of the phone call), and she told me no problem, I could start a day later so I could rest and heal peacefully at home, which I did today. And let me tell you, it made all the difference! I was finally able to nap, my nose is less stuffy and my throat barely aches anymore!

Tonight my mother sent me a text asking how my first day went and I told her that actually, my first day would be tomorrow and how we arranged this with HR because of my illness.

Immediately I received a text from my father, who was apparently sitting next to her, telling me that was I did was unacceptable, that unless I was literally hospitalized I had no valid reason to delay my first day of work and that I am starting with a serious disadvantage because of my unprofessional behavior.

Now I am beginning to wonder, even though the HR employee was really nice and understanding, if my father might be right and if I really seriously messed up here.

26,1fdr8j7,AITA for keeping my husband from his family? ,"My husband (M29) and I (F25) recently moved closer to his family (and further from mine) by multiple 100s of miles due to a career change for my husband. We have had many discussions as a couple about how much time with each other’s families we are willing to give, and recently, I feel like that boundary has been crossed. 

His mom and grandmother always act like it’s been three years since they’ve last seen him. Granny guilt trips and pines about how short her time is on this earth, and demands his (and my) time for all major holidays, throwing huge sobbing fits and making horribly rude remarks about me (especially focused on my weight) if we say we cannot meet up for a holiday. One consistent remark she makes towards me is that I am “a huge wedge between him and his family, but that’s just my opinion I’m sorry”. 

My mom turns 50 this year right at Christmas. Hubby and I are visiting my parents this year as last year, we spent Christmas with his family. My parents live 30 hours away by car. His parents live 1.5 hours away by car. We have limited time with my family and have to make the time count, so we’re spending a full week at Christmas with my parents.This is a huge issue for Granny and she always asks me if I have “changed my mind” for Christmas, insinuating I am ripping my husband away from family gatherings and that I should consider his needs. 

His mom has requested our time at family gatherings every weekend since moving closer. Hubby and I had agreed upon maybe 1-2 weekends a month for family visits. Since moving here, we have spent 8/12 weekends with his family, and several weekday dinners with them. It has been near impossible to get any unpacking done because so much of our time has been spent traveling to his family’s home and spending a full day there. I’ve set a boundary that we cannot have guests over until we are unpacked. His side of the family does not like this boundary, and ask me every time we visit if I have “put the house together yet” so they can visit.

We missed a family get together this weekend due to work obligations, and got a call from his sister saying we were sore losers for not attending (she rarely attends family functions due to work but we never say a word if she misses). His mom wants to call soon to schedule a date for his family to come visit our new house (aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc. —a huge family reunion!) and I am preparing to say no. When we moved here, we used all our money and haven’t had the finances to furnish our near-empty home. There’s not enough seating nor furniture in our home to prepare guests; we finally got 2 chairs last week! 

So, in preparation for angry comments from his family about how, “since we met, they never see my husband anymore”, I just need to know if I am TAH for trying to set a boundary of what is our time and what is family time with his family. Is this unfair or unreasonable?

UPDATE: I’m sorry I didn’t explain this originally, I ran out of post characters! I talked with my husband before I posted, as we had talked to his family to help establish more firm boundaries regarding visits. That was three or four weeks ago, and the boundaries are having a rough time sticking. 

We are reliant on help from his dad’s truck for transporting large items we need to fix up our fixer upper home, as our vehicles are too small. The only thing his family asks in return is that we spend dinner with them as a thank you. We also feel obligated due to some financial assistance we received from his parents when we moved and an unexpected large expense came out of the blue. I am struggling with feeling guilt about saying “no” to someone I actively owe a lot of gratitude for, and the comments from Granny and SIL about missing family gatherings really helped make this a mountain out of a mole hill. 

I expressed these concerns to Hubby and he took the charge immediately. We called his parents and he talked about visits and how the time commitment that we must make to come visit is excessive. Hubby also took the “blame” for several missed outings due to his work, and expressed that to his family while reestablishing boundaries we had discussed with them a month ago. MIL has stopped pushing for Granny to come visit us as much and has said she will pass on the info that we just are too busy with other obligations right now. We weren’t able to call Granny yet but plan to do so soon. 

Hubby thinks I am over analyzing his Granny’s comments (he informed me months ago that she is actually on the path to get a dementia diagnosis and has been saying/doing things out of character), but he agrees that her emotional abuse and jabs at me are unacceptable. He promised that when he hears her say anything negative about me separating him from his family or anything rude about my weight, he will shut it down immediately. He also promised that any comments about if I have “changed my mind” about Christmas, that he would stop those remarks and explain it was a joint decision.

We are reliant on help from his dad’s truck for transporting large items we need to fix up our fixer upper home, as our vehicles are too small. The only thing his family asks in return is that we spend dinner with them as a thank you. We also feel obligated due to some financial assistance we received from his parents when we moved and an unexpected large expense came out of the blue. I am struggling with feeling guilt about saying “no” to someone I actively owe a lot of gratitude for, and the comments from Granny and SIL about missing family gatherings really helped make this a mountain out of a mole hill. 

I expressed these concerns to Hubby and he took the charge immediately. We called his parents and he talked about visits and how the time commitment that we must make to come visit is excessive. Hubby also took the “blame” for several missed outings due to his work, and expressed that to his family while reestablishing boundaries we had discussed with them a month ago. MIL has stopped pushing for Granny to come visit us as much and has said she will pass on the info that we just are too busy with other obligations right now. We weren’t able to call Granny yet but plan to do so soon. 

Hubby thinks I am over analyzing his Granny’s comments (he informed me months ago that she is actually on the path to get a dementia diagnosis and has been saying/doing things out of character), but he agrees that her emotional abuse and jabs at me are unacceptable. He promised that when he hears her say anything negative about me separating him from his family or anything rude about my weight, he will shut it down immediately. He also promised that any comments about if I have “changed my mind” about Christmas, that he would stop those remarks and explain it was a joint decision. ",0.0,0.025333454832434654,0,1
27,1fdr7ik,WIBTA for telling my mum she can't come on holiday with me,"I (31F) go on holiday with my dad's side of the family (aunties, uncles, cousins) every year for the past 5 years. We don't see much of each other throughout the year so we use this holiday as a way to catch up.

I recently got married and at my wedding my mum expressed to my auntie that she has always been envious of these holidays and wants to come with us. My auntie admitted to feeling put on the spot and invited her and now my mum is very excited about joining us when we go next year. 

My mum and dad have been divorced since I was 5 years old. My mum is not at all close with my dad's side of the family. From the time I was a child up until the wedding my mum has always told me these were the worst people alive, that they looked down on me and my life because im not Catholic and that they think my mums side of the family is 'common' because we have never had as much money as them. It took a lot of courage 5 years ago to start going on these holidays. I knew I wanted to reach out to them because I felt bad for being so distant, and I suspected my mum wasn't being entirely truthful about how they felt about me. Immediately my aunties, uncles and cousins were incredibly kind and warm to me and my husband and I am SO glad for taking that leap of faith because now I have relationships I never had before.

I feel the only reason she wants to go is because she's jealous, which she has admitted to me and others. She was very friendly with them at the wedding which was nice to see, but I feel weird about sharing a house with my divorced parents and I can't really understand why my mum wants to be on holiday with her ex husband and his family anyway? My dad also has a partner, my stepmum, who feels weird about my mum and her husband joining us.

For some context my mum is married but other than her husband doesn't really have any friends. She's dealt with disabilities most of her life which has isolated her, and her best friend (and only friend) was my grandmother who died 2 years ago. I think she's expecting me to make her my best friend, but our relationship is complicated due to her being an alcoholic and I find her difficult to be around at times. She's VERY emotional and intense, but she loves me very much. I don't want to hurt her feelings but if she comes on this holiday I will feel angry at her for manipulating her way into this one thing I get to do with my dad. 

I'm considering offering to go on a separate holiday with her as a compromise, as I don't usually do this. I do recognise her latching onto this is probably because I don't give her enough attention and I feel bad for that.

I grew up not eating well. I was given food that most people would NOT consider edible but I only recognized this after several years. It has impacted my ability to tell via taste. I struggle to recognize when something doesn't taste good. I'll eat something most people would be disgusted by. I have learned how to cook as an adult and I have asked for my husband and his family to be honest if something wasn't good. They told me it was good. They have always eaten what I cook and said nice things.

My husband's parents hosted a dinner party recently and asked each kid/IL to bring a dish. I noticed right away that my dish was a struggle for other guests. It was the only one being somewhat avoided or ignored on the plates of guests... and then someone asked who the hell cooked it because they wanted to get sick. I apologized and said I had no idea it was bad. I was a bit of a mess honestly. I took the rest of my dish up and tossed it so nobody else would (accidentally or not) grab any. A few guests apologized for not eating it and I said it was fine. I offered to let them dump it on my plate. Things grew tense. One person felt unwell after it.

I felt so upset that my husband and his family placed me in that position. They know I can't tell personally. Yet nobody said my cooking was bad or that I shouldn't bring a dish. I told them when everyone else left that they should have been honest instead of letting me embarrass myself and make others uncomfortable, because clearly people were unsure what to do about the dish I brought and were trying not to offend. I told them I had asked for a reason. I want to learn and do better but I can't if they lie when asked.

Some of my husband's siblings said I should never expect that from them and I was trying to make them behave badly.

I have a coworker who is old enough to remember the moon landing. You may think this is where I was rude, but I tried to be like ""I'm not calling you old, I just want to hear your lived experience"" and then I asked her ""do you remember the moon landing?"" 

The first thing she said was ""that's fucking fake!"" I was taken aback and just asked ""the moon landing?"" She said yes and went on about how the moon landing was faked, she used to believe in it but then her boyfriend showed her these YouTube videos and they had good evidence and now she knows it's fake. 

I asked her how the government could possibly have faked it without someone leaking the secret. She then went on to talk about how of course the government could keep a secret and push an agenda - look at the COVID vaccines, those destroy your DNA and give you cancer! She also talked about how the government is making people eat fake meat becauee Bill Gates wants to depopulate the Earth because of climate change. As she's going on I interrupted and said ""C'mon,  [coworker] this is crazy talk.""

37,1fdq3hk,AITA for refusing to go to my friends' wedding at last minute if they don’t change the groomsman’s outfit?,"I (20M) got invited to be a groomsman in my close friends’ (24M/23F) wedding and was elated. My friends are both fashion designers (more artistic photoshoots than commercial), so they said they were going to design all of the outfits to suit the person wearing and asked me if I’d be down. I said I’d absolutely love it, and to feel free to do whatever - but I did say that in the context of capes or high boots. Also, on-season me is a vain idiot who’s far too comfortable with his looks.

The summer passed and they talked about a few of the outfits, but were keeping most of them secret until the fall. Cool. Friday, they finally sent out the info to make sure everyone knew what they were wearing. I love the design of mine, except for one detail. ***They didn’t give me a shirt.***

So, for context, I’m a photography and swimsuit model. People *do* take pictures of me shirtless a lot. But fall is my off season, and I’m not in good condition right now. I don’t think I’m overweight or anything, but I don’t look good, and I would really like to wear clothes right now.

I told them basically that - that this looked a little cool for a fall wedding and I wasn’t in great shape to wear it. They said it’d be fine and I should just go for it, and told me about how much work they had put into designing it. I told them again that I just don’t feel  alright wearing it - reality doesn’t work like staged photoshoots, my abs look awful, and since I’m the only one that doesn’t have a real shirt at all it feels… uncomfortably sexual. They got kind of mad and said that if I was so flustered by my weight I should go on a diet. I told them I’m not a stripper and hung up.

Yeah, mature, I know.

(They did text me after to apologize for the diet comment, and I apologize for the stripper comment.)

The other problem is that apparently they’ve designed the bridesmaid’s and groomsmen’s outfits in pairs. Viola is wearing something designed to be balanced with mine. She gets a shirt, of course, but it was designed to go with mine and she’s super into her outfit and seamed pretty upset when I said I was trying to get mine changed. I get throwing a shirt or vest of waistcoat or something will ‘throw off the composition’ and they’ve only got three weeks to plan and make it, but at this point I just don’t care. But Viola’s awesome and looked genuinely deeply upset, and she wasn’t the one who decided to plan this, so I feel awful about how it’d affect her if I drop or refuse the outfit.

I aslo know they put a lot of work into this and probably aren’t trying to be remotely creepy, so I don’t know why I’m reacting this bad. I’m just hurt they didn’t care more about me than about their designs, but at the same time, I’m being irrational and those outfit definitely took months to plan and sew.

Also please read comments before an info, it probably has been answered

So, my daughter recently started college in person and part of her expenses is covered by a meal plan. She is 19 and her first year of college was commuting because of her anxiety. She decided to go to college in person this year and is staying in the dorms. The problem is her food card isn't working.  It’s something that can easily be fixed by contacting the college dining services, but she refuses to go talk to them. She needs to get a new one since this one is bent.

My daughter has pretty bad anxiety, especially around making phone calls and talking to people in authority. I’ve told her repeatedly that all she needs to do is go to the dining services office, but she won’t do it. As a result, she’s been skipping meals and calling me, upset that she’s hungry. I have expressed multiple time that she needs to handle this and go talk to the people.

I’ve refused to step in and handle it for her. I got a call today asking me to give her some money to buy food at Walmart. I told her no and told her to go talk to the people. This resulted in an argument and she thinks I am being a huge asshole.  

My spouse thinks I’m being too harsh and send money or fix it for her

It's 14 years old, been borrowed out to 7-8 different users, been used every year for tons of splitting. Me personally have used it for wood that gets me through 2-3 seasons worth of wood. Don't exactly know how many cords or the quantity. It's been running great for me personally. 

They've never serviced it, until i changed the oil 2 years ago. Followed manuals and got permission to do it. Was black like I've never seen any hydraulic oil. Needs new oil every 150 hours of use. This thing is slow as hell splitting wood. So I bet over 14 years it's run at least 2000 hours, probably closer 25% or 50% more. 

But over to the problem. I returned it and they were going to use it. Didn't have the power to split anymore (which it did 2 months prior). Now I am an asshole according to them and I need to pay a shop to fix it, it's cheaper buying a new one which is $275. 275 usd for a log splitter is like, idk, but it's certainly not quality lol.

Our childhood was not a happy one. But he was responsible for the four of us (older brother, me, younger sister and younger brother) being the adults we are today. It was totally unfair but we do not have a typical sibling dynamic even though we have become more like siblings as adults vs a kid trying to raise other kids. I owe him everything. And I appreciate him more than anyone else in my life. He gave up so much for me/us.

We had talked before about weddings and I told him if I ever got married I'd want him to be more than a groomsman or bridesman. That he was so much more than my brother and he was cool with and even touched by the fact I'd want him to act like father of the bride. In so many ways he is, as unfair as that is.

My fiance understands this and he knew the score before we even got engaged.

I told him my brother might not be old enough but he was effectively the only parent I ever had and that while I appreciate him (future FIL) my brother deserves to be recognized for what he did. I also told him I did appreciate his offer and it was very kind of him.

He brought it up Sunday evening when my fiance and I joined a family dinner. MIL was quick to step in and say that it made perfect sense and FIL was talking nonsense and my fiance told him that he should understand that appearances matter way less than actual relationships and our wants and comfort for our wedding. FIL told me he felt offended that I'd pass on him when he will become what is basically a father to me after I marry his son. MIL told him he was being silly because he doesn't need to walk me down the aisle or play a specific role for me in the wedding to act in a caring way.

42,1fdpkoo,AITAH for not letting fil's gf turn the heater on during summer? ,"My husband and i live with my fil.  My fil has a gf that lives in a whole other state and comes to visit for about 3-4weeks during summer and maybe 1 week in october for his bday. In the beginning we all lived in a smaller apt that was actually my husbands cousins but due to him moving, he let my fil take over. This year the cousin moved back so the three of us rented out a condo. 

In the year and a half we lived at the cousins place, my fil paid most of the rent, and the electricity. Of course he did what he wanted there as in mess with the thermostat to how he wanted it when he wanted.

Now that we have this new place its the three of ours name on the lease and my husband and I pay our share of rent, the electricity and the internet bills. My fil pays the rent.

She just came to visit for three weeks and she was turning the heater on at 80degs at night in the middle of summer when its 70-75deg out side. All because she doesn't like the cold. Each room has a ceiling fan and my fil leaves his on 24/7. I became frustrated because it is still expected of us to sacrifice our comfort for his guest without him really doing more to make sure HIS guest comfortable. 

I finally said if she doesn't get cold there won't be a reason for the heater to come on at night and shut the whole air conditioner off. Eventually, he came to speak with me and i told him how its not okay. That our electricity bill was already 89$ for just 21 days and its crazy to turn on the heater when its hot out side. He said he will pay the electricity and apologized for the heater turning on. 

That same night she decided to turn the heater on at 78degs. it was very obvious that the point was missed and my husband and I shut the air conditioner sys off again. The next day fil turned the ac on again and i said no. We are not doing this again because the heater was turned on. He again said he will pay the electricity. i let him know its not even about him paying, its about the heater not needing to come on during summer. If she is cold he can shut the ac off and open a window which will give her the temp she desires. He can turn the fan off in the room. Buy her a bigger blanket. That its much easier for someone who's cold to warm up in a house than it is for someone who is hot to cool down in a house. Let him know of the fact that my husband has not been able to sleep at night because its so hot and hes the one who goes to work early in the morning. We ended the conversation in a good note. 

After that the gf didn't come out much. My fil gave me a little attitude The 2x i did see the her, i didn't get the usual friendly ""hey. Instead it was just a ""hey"" in monotone and a up and down look like she is sizing me up. I actually have no qualms with the gf. I'm just tired of constantly being uncomfortable in my home.

43,1fdpiay,AITA for not inviting my depressed friend to DnD?,"I (20) and my friend Rey (20) met in high school and have been very close ever since. We've had fallouts over the years, but she and I have the sort of homoplatonic relationship you mistake for love every now and again, so we always found back to each other. We explored our interests in nerd culture together: Critical Role, Dimension20, manhwa, fantasy books, RPGs and stuff...

It's because of these fond memories that I can't reconcile her distant nature with the image I still have of her. Rey is avoidant, unstable and unusually judgmental these days. She lays our long-distance communication issues at my feet when she's the one who cancels on me every time we make plans. 

""The phone works both ways."" - when she barely texts me *at all*. I've learned to anticipate her last-minute excuses of illness, cramps or (get this) being unable to move due to having slept weird on her back.

It's gotten to the point where I just anticipate her cancelling. I agree to meet up when i know I don't have time. Which, for the record, has only gone badly once: Last time she visited, I had to kick out a few friends I was wrapping up a watch party with. But ultimately, I was just glad to see her again.

That visit gave me hope. But the next time we wanted to hang, when her birthday came around and I had bought all her favourite food and drinks and taken the whole day off, she was a no-show. We haven't made plans since.

Which is why I didn't end up telling her about the DnD group I curated for us.

We're both pretty anti-social and don't have a lot of friends to invite, but we've always wanted to play DnD. Some time ago, I met up with a few guys from a local forum and hit it off on a oneshot (single-session DnD game, different from its usual, much longer campaign-format.)

I was glad to have vetted them beforehand and meant to tell Rey about a potential long-time group. But I've since realised that if I invited her, there would be a very real risk of her not coming. The group and I have since made concrete plans for a full campaign.

It may not sound like a big deal, but it feels like such a stab in the back on my part. All i can think of is her laughter at the table whenever we could scrounge up players together. She's genuinely the most special person I've ever had in my life. But I just fear she isn't, anymore.

I know what it's like to be depressed. I don't demand good-morning good-night texts every day. I'm medicated, too. But I also know that no matter how much I'd like for it to, a friendship can't be sustained by one person alone. Or a DnD game, I guess. 

As our DM, it's my responsibility to make sure we can play regularly and have everyone integrated into the game. I don't think i can demand the same patience I have for her from these guys. So as an organiser, I know this was the right call. But was it the right call for a good human being?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITA for not inviting my depressed friend to DnD? I (20) and my friend Rey (20) met in high school and have been very close ever since. We've had fallouts over the years, but she and I have the sort of homoplatonic relationship you mistake for love every now and again, so we always found back to each other. We explored our interests in nerd culture together: Critical Role, Dimension20, manhwa, fantasy books, RPGs and stuff...

It's because of these fond memories that I can't reconcile her distant nature with the image I still have of her. Rey is avoidant, unstable and unusually judgmental these days. She lays our long-distance communication issues at my feet when she's the one who cancels on me every time we make plans. 

""The phone works both ways."" - when she barely texts me *at all*. I've learned to anticipate her last-minute excuses of illness, cramps or (get this) being unable to move due to having slept weird on her back.

It's gotten to the point where I just anticipate her cancelling. I agree to meet up when i know I don't have time. Which, for the record, has only gone badly once: Last time she visited, I had to kick out a few friends I was wrapping up a watch party with. But ultimately, I was just glad to see her again.

That visit gave me hope. But the next time we wanted to hang, when her birthday came around and I had bought all her favourite food and drinks and taken the whole day off, she was a no-show. We haven't made plans since.

Which is why I didn't end up telling her about the DnD group I curated for us.

We're both pretty anti-social and don't have a lot of friends to invite, but we've always wanted to play DnD. Some time ago, I met up with a few guys from a local forum and hit it off on a oneshot (single-session DnD game, different from its usual, much longer campaign-format.)

44,1fdp4fo,AITA for asking my family to attend therapy as my birthday gift?,"I (42f) went NC with my maternal family last year after a big fight that was started because I inadvertently chose the wrong word when making a post on social media about how much I missed my grandma. I have no issues with reconnecting, but only after they've done therapy. 

I accidentally said ""she (grandma) raised me"" instead of ""she taught me"" because as I very recently discovered, I have apraxia. One of my coping mechanisms is I choose a similar word in order to continue with the conversation or my train of thought. Yes, I have apologized numerous times

Side notes: my step-dad adopted me when I was a toddler after he married my mom. Grandma in this story is his mom. I've been attending therapy for years but they don't.

My sister (38f), I found out, was jealous that I could remember all of the indigenous teachings that our grandma told us. She told our mom that I was lying. TBH, she was a toddler at the time of the teachings so of course she can't remember them.

My mom decided to verbally attack me instead of asking why I said the wrong word. She accused me of ripping step-dad's entire family apart with this claim, told me grandma never loved me at all, and then accused me of SA'ing my cousins when I was 7 (absolutely not true and I can tell the full story later).

Ever since I went NC, a family friend (58f) has been trying to get me to reach out but I refuse to until my mom, at the very least, goes to therapy. She's had anger issues my entire life and I am afraid that if I do talk to her before she's sought help, it will just end up like our big fight last year. Friend doesn't like my continual refusal to talk with my family. 

My birthday was 2 weeks ago and friend brought the subject of reconnecting up again. I asked if my family has done therapy and when I was told no, I said then no I won't be reaching out to them. 

I say if my mom truly loves me, she would go to therapy. Her refusing to go proves she doesn't actually love me.

Friend hasn't spoken to me ever since my birthday because I asked for my family to attend therapy and she feels it's unnecessary 

Edit: I don't want to force my family into therapy. I want them to go into therapy willingly if they would like a relationship with my kids and I. They have a lot of issues, my mom especially, that need to be dealt with before they can attempt to reconnect with myself. This comes from my therapist who has seen all of the texts that I've been sent since the big fight. Again, I don't want to force them into therapy, I want them to go willingly. If they want a relationship with me and my kids, they know my boundaries and what needs to be done. I have no issues remaining NC if they don't want to go into therapy.

45,1fdp40c,AITA for they way I scored my works poker tournament,"Hi All

So at work I arranged a poker night, I'm the business owner and the boss. The staff had agreed to a tournament in the evening and I even arranged for dealer for the night. 

We were playing Texas Hold'em  and there were about 8 of us.  I decided that it would not be in good spirit for the game to continue too far once too many people were out, so to remedy this is thought the easiest way to solve this is for the game to restart when I feel too many people are out. 

In the first game after 2 people were out, I decided that was enough, so we called it and i took tally of the value of chips each player had remaining

then we reset. all back to 1000 chips each

in the second game After 3 people were out, I decided that was enough and took tally of the value of chips, and added it to what people had left at the end of the first game,

Then we reset back to 1000 chips each.

Then in this final game, once 4 people were out, I took stock of the number of chips.  Added up the value, then decided the winner based on who had the highest value of chips in total from the 3 games.

I gave the person that lost a poker for dummies, and we had a good laugh at their expense. 

Anyway, that person said what I did was unfair and quite easy for me to influence one way or the other, and we should have used a points system from the order each person is knocked out.

I told they they are wrong and had them admit to that effect to the whole office.  

AITA and what can I do to help my staff better understand probabilities and fairness.

A month ago, she met a guy who seemed really nice and charming and they talked for a bit. 
3 weeks ago I believe, she invited him over for the first time. It was our first time meeting him.

He left for the weekend and came back Monday. 
He stayed everyday which I thought was kinda weird. I didn't even know he was staying while she was at work because I work at night. I wouldn't have known if my friend hadn't informed me.
Her dad comes by the following weekend and I overhear her telling him that he can't meet her dad. Well, she's already met his mom and family. She's told us of how nice they were and such. 
I went outside to ask her if he had met her dad yet and she scoffed with, ""it hasn't been that long yet. It's not that serious.""
So if it isn't that serious, it was even weirder that he was around every day all day with her. They had sex everyday and made sure to let us know. 
It wasn't that big of a deal at the time but I didnt want to pry in their business. I didn't know how to confront them in my own home.
Two weeks ago, he came over while she was at work. He walked to my house with all of his clothes in a dufflebag.

So the following day, I stopped them before they went to the room and asked what was up because she took him to work and picked him up and brought him back here.
She said that they were in a serious relationship. So I said that's not what you told me or my friend. She said things changed because he finally got a job. He had just got the job that night. So I said ""so you became his gf last night?""

She's an only child and tends to be a bit on the selfish side. I'm not gonna go through all of her history because that's her private business, but throughout the years I have noticed that she likes to insert herself into plans I make with people and she complains if something gets changed.

The last few times I've had her hang out with my friends and I or my partner and I, I get told by people afterwards that they don't like that Jackie gets flirtatious with their partners, or in my partners case that she gets flirtatious with him (when that happens he'll hold me and get very lovey with me in what I'm assuming is a way to get the point across he's not into her.) I've also been told by friends and my partner that it annoys them when Jackie makes comments acting like she's the only one that has gone through a rough time.

A recent example of this was when my partner and I were talking of our plans of going to Disney in a couple of years because he had never been before and I really want to take him, Jackie had said to my partner, ""Well I've been wanting to go to Disney my whole life."" He just kinda looked at me before he responded and in a way called her out on her behavior, saying, ""Wow, you act like you're the only one allowed to miss out on things."" She got quiet after that.

Jackie also tends to make things about herself, and she gets extremely defensive if you ask her anything about what's going on. She has also gotten extremely jealous when I make plans with other people. So for the past few weeks I've been contemplating telling her why my friends and partner don't want to be around her and why it can only be her and I if she wants to hang out with me because I don't want to make my friends or my partner uncomfortable when her behavior gets bad.

I could list a ton more examples of some of the things she has done, but then this post would get unbearably long. Anyways to conclude, I want to tell her about all of this because she's trying to insert herself into plans I'm making with my partner this Halloween season. It's our first Halloween season as a couple, and I want to make it special and just for us, and I don't want her to ruin the mood or make things about her.

Depending on how the conversation goes is going to determine whether or not I drop her, because I also started to have a realization as I read the comments that she has always been very selfish in one form or another and it gets exhausting to deal with her at times even with me doing mostly one on one interactions.

50,1fdnhoh,AITA for shouting at my husband for locking me out of the house?," 

This one is pretty simple. Most days I get home before my husband. He has a habit of putting his keys in the door when he gets in. Thing is, even if he gets home and realises I'm not there, he doesn't bother to remove his keys, and even when unlocked, you still need to use the key to get the door open. So when I get home, I can't get the key in to open the door, leaving me stuck there waiting for him to come let me in. Today I didn't have to wait too long, but in the past there's been a few occasions where he's been in the middle of doing something so I've been stood there with no way to get in until he finishes and can come open the door. I've told him enough times; if I'm not home, take his keys out of the door. Is that really too much to ask?

This one is pretty simple. Most days I get home before my husband. He has a habit of putting his keys in the door when he gets in. Thing is, even if he gets home and realises I'm not there, he doesn't bother to remove his keys, and even when unlocked, you still need to use the key to get the door open. So when I get home, I can't get the key in to open the door, leaving me stuck there waiting for him to come let me in. Today I didn't have to wait too long, but in the past there's been a few occasions where he's been in the middle of doing something so I've been stood there with no way to get in until he finishes and can come open the door. I've told him enough times; if I'm not home, take his keys out of the door. Is that really too much to ask?

51,1fdnb7q,AITA for asking my roommate to get their snoring checked out?,"I (28M) have a roommate (30NB) and we share a one bedroom apartment. It’s not the best living situation for two people, but it’s what we can comfortably afford. I sleep in the living room while my roommate sleeps in the bedroom.

I’m not a confrontational person at all and am someone to take a lot in terms of verbal and mental abuse. I’m very much a kicked puppy when someone raises their voice with be due to my own past traumas. My roommate is the opposite and tends to be very aggressive (not physically). They do not take any kind of approach well at all when it comes to things relating to cleaning the house, money, food, etc.

Our apartment is very small, so everything can be heard even through a closed door. If you’re struggling in the bathroom, the other person is going to hear. If you’re on the phone, the other person is going to hear your conversation. I’ve started stepping outside for phone calls because they’d hear my end of the conversation and pry into my business. So of course when my roommate snores at night, I can hear it. Despite being very small, they snore like a full grown man. And it’s not *just* snoring, but they’ll wake up coughing loudly from it and have to come out into the kitchen to get a drink, where they’ll continue coughing and clearing their throat before going back to bed. It wakes me up at night and keeps me awake. Most nights I’m lucky to get 3 hours of sleep before I’m woken up by snoring and hacking. It’s been going on for nearly a year now but I’ve been too scared to say anything because I knew I’d get snapped at. While yes my overall concern is my own mental and physical health because I can’t get enough sleep, but I am also concerned about their own health at this point.

Well it finally got to me yesterday morning and I said something. I was as nice as I could be, but I admit I did probably come off more harsh than I normally would. I told them they should see someone about their snoring and that I’d even loan them copay money (they have health insurance through work) if they needed. I told them snoring as harshly as they do and coughing as badly as they do might be a sign that something else is wrong. They lost it on me. Saying how their health is none of my business and that snoring is normal, that it’s just something everyone in their family does and how I’m an asshole for trying to shame them into a doctor’s visit for a health concern that’s not actually a concern.

Last night, when I saw a friend of theirs while doordashing, they said I stepped too far when bringing up someone’s health.

I didn’t think it would come off as anything bad or rude, but I guess maybe letting it build up in fear of getting yelled at and snapping made it come across as extremely insensitive and the response I got was warranted?

53,1fdmnyo,AITAH for not updating my mother about my Aunt health?,"I am on mobile so I apologize for typos. 

For context, I have been no contact with my mother (MD) for about a year. Her alcoholism was getting worse and I had to go from low to no contact. Also my Auntie never married and no kids, so MD and I are her only remaining family. 

My Great Aunt is 92, she transitioned into a nursing home early this year. She has been fighting cancer for a few years now and we got the unfortunate news last month that the cancer is end stage, and there are no further treatment options. Auntie has transitioned into palitive care, focusing on comfort and quality of life. 

MD is aware of Aunties cancer. MD was originally listed as (inactive) medical power of attorney, Auntie is still sharp and has full control of her medical choices. However MD stopped calling Auntie, wouldn't respond to calls, mail, or email from doctors, nursing home, or social workers either. I broke my NC to try and discuss how to help Auntie. MD refused to discuss Auntie and just yelled about other topics. 

Due to no communication from MD, Auntie asked me to become POA. The medical POA will become active as her condition worsens. We have discussed all Aunties wishes so I can honor them. I live out of state but travel regularly to be at all Dr appointments, spend long days in the nursing home with Auntie etc. I am basically splitting my time between states to be home with my family and at Aunties bedside. I sorted out all the finances and paperwork. My husband and kids even spent summer vacation in Aunties state. Kids are young and they have enjoyed visiting Auntie. Husband is my rock and super dad supporting me in frequent travel, we both agree Auntie deserves to be surrounded by family during this time. 

Throughout the past 6 months MD has not called or written. Nor has MD answered when Auntie has tried to call. Auntie doesn't know I'm NC, she doesn't need drama introduced, nor do I want to taint memories or the relationship she has with MD. 

When we got the oncology update, I asked Auntie if she wanted me to keep MD updated. Auntie told me that if MD doesn't care enough to talk to her anymore, then she doesn't want to waste the time or energy on MD anymore. As Auntie put it, the only family that matters are the ones that are present... me, my husband and the kids. 

I want to honor Aunties wishes. It feels wrong not to update MD on Aunties health. Looking towards the future, hospice and the end, however fast or slow it comes. I feel like I should give MD the chance to make amends. On the other hand, MD has the address, and phone numbers, but chooses not to reach out. 

Auntie has also requested no funeral service. I will have a small celebration of life with her few remaining friends. For MD I am preparing a memory box, pictures, recipes, and one of those memory journals. If I can figure out how to propagate roses I will include a rose bush Auntie and my great grandmother planted together. I hope this will bring closure to MD and still respect Aunties final wishes...

54,1fdmmpk,AITAH for staying home this Christmas,"On mobile so I apologize any mistakes. 

My husband (26m) and I (27f) are due to have our second child 1 week before Thanksgiving. Our son just turned 1.5 as of posting this. I've already let all our family know that not only will we be missing Thanksgiving this year, but most likely Christmas as well. Our family went nuts upon hearing this news. They understand missing Thanksgiving but are up in arms about us missing Christmas. 

My husband and I talked extensively about missing the holidays year because it's important to us that our son get to experience them surrounded by loved ones, especially Christmas. We thought maybe my husband could take our son out to see some family for Christmas but me being left behind with our newborn at home just didn't sit right with either of us. Assuming I deliver on my due date, I'd be around 5-6 weeks postpartum. At this stage after my first pregnancy, I was still in diapers and struggled greatly getting out of bed and moving around the house. I couldn't imagine sitting in a car for a few hours as we go from place to place seeing family.
When we broke the news to family that we wouldn't be teavling for Christmas we in the same breath, let them know that our door is always open and anyone is more than welcome to come see us. This was taken as us being extremely selfish. 
Our house is quite small so we can't exactly hoast a lot of people at once which is the point many family members made. My grandma, who was the most vocal about this, hosts every year due to having a large home. She claimed it's easier for us to come to them and see everyone in one place rather than everyone coming to us in our cramped house over an hour away. I pointed out that they're just ONE side of the family we have to see. My husband delt with his family so I can't speak much to the specifics of their reactions. Both my husband's and I's parents are divorced and remarried. We collectively go to 5 places each holidy to see the whole family. When we tried explaining this to everyone, it's like they had blinders on saying ""well you can just see them another day"" as if they have the highest priority. This is the point where my husband and I put our foot down with each of our own families stating firmly that we WILL be home this Christmas and anyone is welcome to come to US. 

Now the family is divided with half understanding where we're coming from, and the other half feeling like we're robbing them of seeing our children on such a special occasion. 

It's really making me second guess our choice to stay home and bonding if we'd really be the assholes if we stuck to our decision.

55,1fdlqm9,WIBTA If I don’t return a dog ,"Firstly I would like to apologise for the messy format as I am typing this on my phone. 

Around 1 months ago I bought a dog from gumtree, when we first saw the dog it was not desexed despite being 2.5 years old and it looked like it wasn’t groomed for at least 6 months this was mostly likely the previous owner was too busy from what I was told. Despite this the personality of the dog drew myself and my family in wanting to get this dog. 

Just a few days ago we got a message from an anonymous number stating they were the relative of the owner and they would like the dog back due to their grandparent’s condition deteriorating and the dog was what bought them happiness. I have yet to receive any message from the owner on this situation but what the relative told me was that without the dog the grandparents aren’t in a constant sad state and would not eat. I showed my friends this message and they pointed out that the messages looked like they were generated from chatGPT however I can neither confirm this is true or not. 

My family has grown attached to dog and helped him transition to a new environment even when the dog got desexed and the dog seems to be happy and highly active. I replied to the anonymous number sympathetically stating that we are sorry to hear about their grandparents condition however we do not plan to return the dog. They responded with a long message basically stating that without the dog their grandparents condition will only get worse and the only way to fix it is to have the dog back.

57,1fdkk8r,AITA for telling my mom that she should’ve warned me about construction? ,"I decided to come out and visit my family for a week and I’m currently on day two. I considered getting a hotel since I never really sleep well there but I decided to not spend the money and figured my parents would be offended if I stayed elsewhere 

When I got here on Friday, my mom told me that they were in the process of renovating the main guest room so they put me up in my brother’s old room, with a door that doesn’t close all the way. I’ve been woken up every morning at 8a and the noise goes on until around 3p. It’s a lot of drilling and hammering and it’s so loud. I purchased ear plugs and nothing has helped. In total, I maybe get 4hrs of sleep. 

I’ll point out that I have epilepsy and lack of sleep is one of my biggest triggers so I’ve worried about having seizures. If my mom had informed me that construction work, I would’ve 100% stayed in a hotel. Also, this trip has been planned for months so it’s not like I showed up. They knew this would be happening and didn’t think it was a big deal for me? 

I finally had it and booked a hotel. I went downstairs with my bag and stated I was leaving due to the noise. My mom disagreed saying it was too much money, that the loud parts of the construction would be done by tomorrow and that she could just give me an extra fan for the noise. I declined and stated that I just wanted some rest. She stated that since they don’t see me very often it’s nice for me to be in the house for the maybe once a year that they see me. That it makes her happy when I stay at the house. I said I would be back to hang out but that I couldn’t sleep there. She laid on the guilt trip and I left angry. I understand her point in terms of not seeing me all year but I wish she had been more considerate and at least told me. 

AITA for leaving and staying in a hotel? 

EDIT: there’s a 3 hr time difference between us so 8a is 5a my time. With lack of sleep being one of my biggest triggers for seizures, it literally puts me at risk of dying or getting seriously injured 

EDIT 2: I work nights back where I live so I’m used to working until 12:30a and I struggle with my sleep. It’s not easy or safe to adjust my sleep schedule so much in a day.

I’ve been woken up every morning at 8a and the noise goes on until around 3p. It’s a lot of drilling and hammering and it’s so loud. I purchased ear plugs and nothing has helped. In total, I maybe get 4hrs of sleep. 

I’ll point out that I have epilepsy and lack of sleep is one of my biggest triggers so I’ve worried about having seizures. If my mom had informed me that construction work, I would’ve 100% stayed in a hotel. Also, this trip has been planned for months so it’s not like I showed up. They knew this would be happening and didn’t think it was a big deal for me? 

I finally had it and booked a hotel. I went downstairs with my bag and stated I was leaving due to the noise. My mom disagreed saying it was too much money, that the loud parts of the construction would be done by tomorrow and that she could just give me an extra fan for the noise. I declined and stated that I just wanted some rest. She stated that since they don’t see me very often it’s nice for me to be in the house for the maybe once a year that they see me. That it makes her happy when I stay at the house. I said I would be back to hang out but that I couldn’t sleep there. She laid on the guilt trip and I left angry. I understand her point in terms of not seeing me all year but I wish she had been more considerate and at least told me. 

AITA for leaving and staying in a hotel? 

EDIT: there’s a 3 hr time difference between us so 8a is 5a my time. With lack of sleep being one of my biggest triggers for seizures, it literally puts me at risk of dying or getting seriously injured 

EDIT 2: I work nights back where I live so I’m used to working until 12:30a and I struggle with my sleep. It’s not easy or safe to adjust my sleep schedule so much in a day. I’d be going to bed at essentially 8p and getting up at 5a",0.0,1.0277012586593628,1,0
58,1fdkgyo,AITAH in my living situation with my mom?,"I (18F) am a full-time college student, have a 7mo girl, and work part time to support me and her. Baby’s dad (B) and I are still together, but we’re stuck in places we can’t handle to be in anymore. He can afford enough for us to move out, but no one has accepted us. So we stay at our own houses.

For context, in my house, I stay with my mom, stepdad, grandmother, and 3 siblings (16y-7y). My baby and I are in one room. Everyone else is crammed.

My mom allowed my GMA to move in with us last winter. Not long after, my GMA’s car broke down and was totaled. Now, she and I share a car which is a horrible situation, especially with me having school, work, and stuff for baby (appts etc). At B’s house, it’s almost the same layout, so that’s a no-go too.

I could move in with my Dad, who’s close to both my work and job, however I wouldn’t have a car so that isn’t possible. I can’t afford another one.

Of course I appreciate the fact that my mom has given me everything I have and hasn’t kicked me out. But that feels like that’s all she cares about. She promised to help me pay for my college but hasn’t put a single cent towards it yet. I’m only upset because she promised to do that. She also stated she’d help buy food diapers etc for my daughter if I needed them, but she only nags me about when I can’t afford more.

She also has access to my bank account because she withdraws money to pay to my bills. But she also uses my money when she doesn’t have enough for something, and takes it without informing me. She took $50 recently without my knowledge and I freaked (she returned it eventually).

Now me and mom have had a LOT of issues in the past and I’ve been in counseling for 8 years because of them, some to which I’ll never forgive her for. It’s been hard to keep my room the cleanest when I’m so busy between school, work and my daughter. I can’t afford to stay up all night cleaning/doing hw because I drive 40 minutes to college and can’t risk dozing off on the road. My room isn’t in horrible shape but I admit it shouldn’t look like it does; there are clothes on the floor everywhere, my laundry baskets stay full with clean clothes until it’s empty, there are water bottles everywhere, some occasional trash like crumpled paper, plastic, etc. Sometimes I leave my daughter’s bottles laying around for a few days but I make sure to get them cleaned as soon as I can.

When I’ve talked to her about moving out next spring, she says she’d “love” for me to get out and do what I want, but she knows I’d come crawling back once I see how hard the world “really is” and that I wouldn’t be able to afford anything. She compares my life to how hers was when she was my age. She was kicked out as soon as she was 18 and had to apartment hop. She went to college about 3 times while raising 4 kids. My life will never be hard because its not what she went through.

Both me and B are exhausted, between both of us working to make sure we have what we need for our baby. AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITAH in my living situation with my mom?

59,1fdjqgo,AITA for rejecting and not going over to boyfriend’s house? ,"For context, my boyfriend (21M) and I (20F) went on a date recently and had to cancel the second half of our plans because his mom got upset.

Although he had informed her that he wouldn’t be home early, she still got angry. Her tone was extremely sarcastic and rude towards both him and me. She also indirectly blamed me.

My boyfriend tried to defend me by explaining that I wanted to visit since I had bought some treats for them and planned to give them as a gift. However, she bluntly said in Chinese, ""Why buy? Your grandma has diabetes and can’t have them anyway."" I didn’t know his grandmother had diabetes.

In the end, even though my boyfriend wanted to stay with me for the rest of the day, I asked him go home.

This wasn’t the first time she had been rude to me. Previously, I couldn’t attend a distant relative’s funeral due to my busy school schedule and the far location. At that time, we had only been dating for three months. She said my mom hadn’t raised me right and made other mean comments.

I was very upset but ended up apologizing to her.

Now, after this second incident, I no longer want to visit. Since I’m Chinese, respecting elders is very important, but I don’t want to pretend to respect someone who has disrespected me and my family twice.

Am I being petty for this? I think I’m putting my boyfriend on the spot. I feel bad for him because none of this is his fault, but he has to act as the mediator. AITA?

60,1fdjpxh,WIBTA if I suggested my roommate re-home her dog?,"EDIT FOR CLARITY: ""rehome"" as in return to her original home with roommate's parents (who are willing to take her in), not a random family. I would never suggest she simply give the dog up for adoption, and I think that would 100% be an AH thing to ask of anyone.


I (F20) am currently a college student living with two girls (Z, 19) (H, 19) in a relatively small apartment. I met them both once before deciding to sign the lease together, since I only needed housing for a semester and was desperate for a place to live (dorm housing was unavailable). They both seemed very sweet, but Z (whom I share a room with) informed that she would have a chihuahua ""ESA"" (using that term lightly) living with us. She ensured me that the dog was housebroken and properly trained, so I naively agreed out of desperation and a rent price that was the lowest I've ever seen for the college town where I live. I also generally like dogs and have one of my own at home, and the reservations I had about living in such a small space with a pet were remedied by Z's reassurance. 

Flash forward three weeks into the semester and the dog has had an accident at least once a day in the apartment. Even with pee pads down (H and I were not informed that the dog needed pee pads, and, when questioned, Z claimed they would only be there for the first couple nights as the dog adjusted) the dog has shit on carpets in both bedrooms, resulting in bleach stains on the carpets after Z used bleach (?) to clean them. The dog barks often, is not walked enough, and just seems generally... sad. All of us are busy with classes and work and the dog is left alone for 6+ hours at a time.

After the first few accidents, Z stated that her parents would be driving up to take the dog back to their home (where she lived before) - this didn't end up happening, since the drive was ""too long."" She (the dog) was supposed to go home a few weekends ago, and has only gotten worse since then. My question is whether or not I would be the asshole if I offered to drive her dog back home? I honestly couldn't give less of a shit about gas money or drive time (4 hours each way), I'm just sick of feeling like everything in my apartment is unsanitary. Z said that she's purchasing a crate by the end of the week, but I'm not sure if that would even help considering most of the accidents when we're home and Z is asleep. 

Also, in case it's relevant, I would say that I'm a decent (and very clean) roommate in general. I clean common spaces everyday and do a weekly ""deep-clean"" of the whole apartment, take out the trash often, dishes daily, vacuum, purchase food for communal use, etc. I don't consider myself a very demanding person (usually I'm a bit of a pushover), but I feel like I've hit a breaking point.

62,1fdjku2,AITA for cutting the amount I contribute to our budget after my wife refused to stick to our agreement regarding our kids. ,"My wife and I agreed before we got married on a lot of the big things. Where we would live. How we would deal with our families. How we would raise our kids. Stuff like that. Deal breakers. 

One of our decisions was that as long as our kids were full time students then they would not have to contribute monetarily to the household budget. Obviously they would still have chores and such. If they weren't full time students then they would get a six month grace period after which they had to pay rent and buy their own food. Rent would be equal to 1/4 of full time minimum wage work. 

We agreed on this in 1998. 

Our eldest did not want to go to university and used the six months after graduation to work, save money, and plan a trip around the world. When he got back he started an apprenticeship and is now a welder. Our middle kid went to university and is now a nurse. Our youngest did one semester of college and decided it wasn't for him. He also decided that he didn't want to work.

After six months I told him that he was now responsible for his rent and food budget. He went crying to his mom saying that he couldn't afford that. She said he didn't have to pay. She didn't discuss it with me first. It was a unilateral decision on her part. 

She pays all our bills. I give her a set amount every month to pay for everything. The money she earns she either spends however she wants or it goes into our vacation fund. 

So I decided to cut my contribution to our budget by the cost of rent and 1/3 of our grocery bill. 

She asked me why I did that and I said that we had an agree that she chose to ignore so I did the same. 

She has been paying the difference out of the money that would normally go into our vacation account and she cut back on her personal spending. But she is pissed that I am doing this. She says I'm an asshole for being financially manipulative.

65,1fdj5tv,AITA for not texting back?,"So I (23F) have this friend (24F) who is a very sweet girl. However she complains a lot and it’s getting too much.
I’ve always dreamed of moving and working abroad but since I don’t have any relatives me and my husband could go to first (neither does he), we had a really hard time finding an opportunity. We finally had our big moment earlier this year then found out I was pregnant. We could have go on with our plan if we could stay in the house we rent (owner said we must move out before the baby is born). Renting another place is almost impossible in our country with a child because owners are afraid of property damage. We had to take out loans and buy a house. I’m satisfied with the life that’s ahead of me even though it doesn’t quite match our plans. Living in a beautiful home with the love of my life and our baby girl sounds like a dream, I’ve always wanted to be a young mom. It came a bit sooner than we planned and we had to find a fast solution without moving back to any of our parents’ home.
My friend had family in the UK so she had a chance to go there. She can afford to study in a university, rent a very nice apartment alone and to keep a cat apart from travelling multiple times a year for weeks and eating out three times a week. She can even save some of her salary. All of these sound amazing to me and I wanted to be there in life before I create a family. It’s been like this for years and all she does is complain about the country, the city she’s living in, her salary and it seems like she doesn’t realize living and working in the UK is what allows her to live the life she’s dreamed of. All I hear is how everything is so expensive which I know it is, everything costs the same here except she makes my monthly salary in a week. If she stayed here she wouldn’t be able to afford half the things she does now. Sometimes it feels like she’s bragging but always tries to make it seem like complaints and sometimes she’s just straight being ungrateful for her opportunities. About a year ago I was in a really bad place mentally and I’ve tried talking to her about this, how I don’t feel like we could be good friends for eachother at that time because it felt like if she didn’t have problems she created some just to complain and I needed a break from texting her. During that time she kept texting me how she misses me and she’s so worried about me but any time she asked how I was all I got was “oh that’s good/oh that’s not good, anyways…” and continued complaining while demanding real interaction to her story. It felt like she didn’t miss or care about me, she missed a free therapist. I nowhere near have the capacity to always being there for her. Yes, I am jealous because even though I know I could reach what she has, with a kid while living in this country it feels like she’s on an airplane while I’m riding a bicycle. 

So AITA for not texting back? 

TLDR: I’m jealous of the problems she’s complaining about. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITA for not texting back? So I (23F) have this friend (24F) who is a very sweet girl. However she complains a lot and it’s getting too much.
I’ve always dreamed of moving and working abroad but since I don’t have any relatives me and my husband could go to first (neither does he), we had a really hard time finding an opportunity. We finally had our big moment earlier this year then found out I was pregnant. We could have go on with our plan if we could stay in the house we rent (owner said we must move out before the baby is born). Renting another place is almost impossible in our country with a child because owners are afraid of property damage. We had to take out loans and buy a house. I’m satisfied with the life that’s ahead of me even though it doesn’t quite match our plans. Living in a beautiful home with the love of my life and our baby girl sounds like a dream, I’ve always wanted to be a young mom. It came a bit sooner than we planned and we had to find a fast solution without moving back to any of our parents’ home.

66,1fdj28w,WIBTA for not fronting the bill when my Dad visits?,"Hii all, I (31M) have always had a strenuous relationship with my dad (56M) who was an absentee parent most of my childhood. He made his way back into my life in my twenties, not by ever apologizing, but by being more involved with my life and reaching out more.

A little background on him, my mom divorced him 26 years ago due to him cheating and his former addiction, and he's never dated since. He doesn't have many friends, and lived with his Mom and brother until about age 50. He works low paying jobs that pay under the table because he owes thousands in backdated child support. Also a thyroid issue heavily affected his mental state- he's just not ""all there"". I'd say he has mental fortitude of a highschooler at best because of this.

He asks to visit once a year, and when he does, he stays for a full week and does not offer to pay for anything outside of his plane ticket here. This means if we go out to eat or go see an attraction, again - I'm fronting the bill. Also, our apartment is very small and my wife (35F) and I both work from home- so we don't have any place to house him when he stays. That also means I'm catching his hotel bill because he doesnt understand why he cant just sleep here. We aren't super financially well off either, I'd say our combined annual household income is around 80k (USA)?

I find myself at conflict because when other family visits, we refuse to let them get the bill because we want to be hospitable to them. Similarly we try to always treat friends when we can. So i feel hypocritical, I wonder if I'm not being any better than him being an absentee parent by being resentful about this. I'm aware if I didn't pay for things, he'd probably not visit at all because he financially can't.

67,1fdix78,AITA for wanting to switch therapists after he somehow accidentally emailed my session notes to my dad instead of me?,"I (28M) have had this one therapist for about a year now. Since our first session I’ve made great strides in many aspects of my life, including now having a loving girlfriend for the first time ever this summer. I have made so much progress that we moved from weekly sessions to biweekly sessions a couple months ago. 

However, the main reason I’m in therapy is more to do with facing intense parental pressure to level up in my career (along with the intense internal pressure I already deal with). Naturally that is one of the main topics I discuss with my therapist. 

He usually sends me session notes after every session; these used to be texted but are now emailed. But yesterday when trying to email the notes to me, it somehow got to my *dad* instead. Y’know, the subject of one of the paragraphs on my notes. It was completely general info but of course still confidential. My therapist said he typed my name but somehow my dad’s email came up, which makes zero sense as I’ve never even told him my parents’ names, much less their emails. For clarification, my email is my first name + middle and last initials, while my dad’s email is his first + last name (we have different first names). Basically nothing in common email-wise. 

I frantically called my dad to tell him that there was an email sent to him in error from my therapist about the notes from our session and to JUST DELETE IT. Of course, he READS IT anyway and we have a 45-minute discussion in the evening because he hyper-fixated on the one part of the email that talks about “our relationship improving” (he’s actually my hero). He wasn’t angry, just sad. I kept trying to reassure him of the fact that he is my hero but he was still sad, it was a discussion that just did not have to happen at all. 

I’m feeling a lot of things. I’m a little annoyed that my dad read the email I told him to just delete, though I understand it’s human nature to be curious. Mostly I feel like my privacy has been violated by my therapist’s irresponsibility (how TF do you not quintuple check the email address FFS) and I didn’t even open the google doc he made with our notes last night. I’m thinking of cutting ties with this therapist and the agency in general and finding another counseling provider that maybe works more closely with my health insurance (for cheaper sessions).

68,1fdivl9,"AITA for asking my girlfriend’s sister to pay me back for the expensive wine she spilled, even though it was at a family dinner?","So, this happened last weekend, and things have been tense since. I (28M) have been dating my girlfriend, **Sarah** (27F), for about a year now. We were invited to a big family dinner at her parents’ house to celebrate her mom’s birthday. It was a formal event, so I decided to bring a bottle of wine as a gift for the family—a really expensive one, like, **$200**. I’m kind of a wine enthusiast, and I wanted to make a good impression.

Everything was going fine until Sarah’s sister, **Megan** (24F), who had already had a couple of glasses of wine, got a little tipsy and clumsy. She knocked over my expensive bottle, shattering it on the floor. My prized wine was wasted—**$200 gone in an instant**—and she just laughed it off like it was no big deal, saying, “Oops, sorry!” and continued talking.

I didn’t want to cause a scene, but I was annoyed. I asked Megan if she could at least chip in to replace the wine she destroyed. She got all defensive, saying it was an accident and that ""nobody expected her to pay for things that break at family events."" She acted like I was the one being rude for even asking, and Sarah said it wasn’t the time or place to bring it up.

I dropped it during dinner, but later that night, I brought it up again privately with Sarah, and she was upset with me, saying it’s just wine and I shouldn’t have made a big deal out of it. I pointed out that it wasn’t *just any wine*, it was expensive, and Megan should be more careful, especially since she was tipsy. Sarah still thinks I’m being ridiculous and “stingy” for asking her sister to cover the cost, and now Megan refuses to apologize.

AITAH if I don’t go to her wedding?

Let’s start off w the back story first. There’s this girl I knew from middle school, we both had daughters around the same time so we’ve become closer since then. She last minute invited me to her bachelorette party and honestly, I was really excited at first because she kept telling me how excited she was that I was gonna be there. She told us all we’d pay for was our part to the air bnb and then our own dinner. I paid $25 for the air bnb that we were going to stay in for the night. She calls me a couple days before and tells me “Hey, since you got invited last minute one of my bridesmaids bought us all matching PJs, anyway we have an extra one for you if you wanna give her the $18” so ofc I didn’t wanna be left out from them so I was just like “okay”. The day of comes and I call her to tell her I’m gonna meet her and the rest of the group at the restaurant, she says “okay that’s fine”. Our reservation was at 5:30, I was there like 5:15ish, their whole group didn’t get there until almost 6, and completely left me in the dark, nobody texted or called me back when I was trying to figure out where they were. They all walked on through the door, and completely ignored me where I was sitting there on the bench. Only 1 of the girls said hi and apologized. Whatever, I got over it and was trying to say hi to the bride (my friend) and tell her she looked super pretty and she was just looking at me dumbfounded… like if I was speaking a different language. We get through dinner and every time I would speak everyone would just look at me like “Who is she and why is she talking?” .. so atp I’m ready to go. This literally feels like middle school all over again, so idgaf ab my $25 or the PJ’s or anything else. We get to the air bnb bc I had to wait for my ride, and I hadn’t even said I wasn’t staying yet, and they’re specifically leaving me out. They made themed drinks and they had enough for everyone except for me. They didn’t invite me outside to smoke, which is fine cause I don’t wanna be called a mooch anyway, I had my own stuff. She also kept talking about how SHE (not her bridesmaid) spent almost $200 on the PJs, and that she hopes they’re comfortable for everyone… I never got mine even though I payed her. Anyway, I left because I was not about to spend my night being left out of everything and feeling like I wasn’t included. I was super nice the whole time and when I left I just explained I wasn’t feeling well, and she couldn’t have cared any less 😂 she said “okay bye” and then that was it.

My fiancé’s mother has serious personality issues. For the sake of wedding planning and my own sanity, I have been giving in to her and letting things go her way for the past 2 years. We have been dating for a little under 10 years but I have only gotten to truly know his parents over the past 2 years when we started wedding planning. Prior to this, I have only hung out with his parents over simple meals. 

For context, his mother has relationship issues with almost everyone in her life (her marriage included). She is an overthinker and believes her children need to see her as the most important person in their lives. My fiancé is not close with his parents and only show up for special occasions like Christmas etc so I ended up being the middle person for any communication with his parents. 

She gave us many problems throughout the wedding planning - literally too many to list out. I lowkey feel like I’m being harassed because she messages me every other day about the wedding. One key incident was when we planned for a meeting with my fiancé’s and my family. Everybody had arrived at the meeting place but his mother bailed at the last minute citing that she’s not comfortable with meeting new people - she also did not let his other family members turn up for the meeting. That was honestly the turning point for me because she is always talking about respect to her children yet I feel she utterly disrespected my family’s time and effort on that day. 

I know her relationship with my fiancé’s father is terrible and they are probably staying married for the sake of his siblings as they are still schooling students who have grown super dependent on her due to her control over them. But I don’t know why he does not stand up to her ridiculous behaviour. His siblings are also too afraid to speak up due to her controlling nature over them. They are not allowed to go out with friends, not allowed to wear sleeveless clothing, not allowed to go on school trips overseas to the point that they literally just stay at home all the time and only go out for school.

I started to distance myself from his mother and either give her super delayed replies to messages or not reply at all. There was once I got so upset that I told my fiancé my honest feelings about his mother. I was sick and tired of giving in her demands even though we are paying for the wedding ourselves. I felt things got awkward between us after we had this conversation and now I feel bad for talking “bad” about his mother.

The lunch had no business objective other than to socialize. I've been trying to change position and I thought the lunch was a great opportunity to do networking.

I was away for 4 or 5 hours and my fiancee says that I was inconsiderate for leaving her sick and alone, and many friends agree with her. 

Additional info: this was the sickest she's ever been since I met her.

As we've gotten older and seen each other less (moved to different states) this has given us a great excuse to get together every year around this time. We normally celebrate by going to a different city for the weekend and exploring to celebrate both of us. Normally another friend or two joins us and it's a great time. This year my friend told me for his birthday he wanted to have a roast for himself in the city he lives with both his local friends and his out of state friends (me). When I was hesitant to agree he pressed me on the situation and I suggested doing something different (less focused on one person). He did not like that and said most of the people already agreed and I should just come down and participate. He is pretty dead set on the Roast of himself.

I’ve always welcomed and received her gifts on behalf of them but now that I have 2 boys we’ve accumulated a lot of stuff.  I’m currently pregnant with my third boy and I told her that although I know she’s always bought cute stuff for the boys, I don’t need anymore clothes for any of them since I have an overwhelming amount at the moment.  When she came to visit in the summer, I reiterated and showed her all the clothes we’ve accumulated over the years and that we don’t need anymore.  She texted me the other day letting me know she was sending a care package with clothes for all three boys, I told her we didn’t need anymore and she said that she’ll send the receipt to exchange what we do and don’t need.  I told my husband I’m just going to donate the clothes as soon as they arrive and he told me I’m an asshole.  Opinions?

I appreciate all the input I also want to add some further context.  We recently moved at the beginning of July and I donated and recycled a lot of the clothes.

76,1fdgtkv,AITA for parting with my friend midway through a Grand Canyon Hike?,"My friend Crystal and I spent six months planning, and training for, a very intense all day hike of the Grand Canyon. We would go down South Kaibab and up Bright Angel, on Crystal's birthday in June (which would be over 100 degrees.) Two weeks before the hike, our friend Valerie said she wanted to join us. Valerie \*looks\* way fitter than us; she does Crossfit and has a six-pack, and we assumed she would be fine. On the trip, leading up to the hike, Valerie was eating salad while Crystal and I were carb loading with pasta and pizza. Crystal and I each brought 4 liters of water, trail mix, and granola bars, and believed Valerie had packed her bag with the same, as it was all in the hotel room for all of us to share when we packed up the night before.

  
About 1/2 of the way down, Crystal and I realized that at the pace Valerie was going (and thus the rest of us), we would not finish the hike before sundown. We told Valerie about our concerns, and she said we should just hike ahead without her, and that she would either catch up or if it was too much, turn back. We asked if she was really sure about it, and she said she was, so off we went. When we got to the bottom of the Canyon, we waited for about an hour at the Colorado River, but did not see her. At that point, we really had to get going so we would finish the trail before nightfall. We tried to call her from a payphone but got her VM (none of us had reception). We explained the situation to a ranger and they said they'd look out for her.

When we were close to the top, and it was actually already dark, we got reception and got messages from her that she had collapsed, and had to stay at the lodge at the bottom of the canyon. (The lodge is booked months out, but I guess they hold some emergency beds.) She would hike out the next day with another group, and said not to worry about her. Both Crystal and I were totally destroyed physically, but we got in the car, went and demolished a pizza, then went to sleep at the hotel. Oddly, we found half of Valerie's water and all of Valerie's food at the hotel. I don't want to make too many assumptions about her, but I think it's clear enough to say that it seemed clear she didn't know how to eat during or before a hike, despite our guidance.

The next day, Valerie said she would be up by 3 PM. I was planning to pick her up. However, the one update we got from her was that she would be hours late. 6 PM rolled around and she still wasn't up. I left her a voice mail letting her know we needed to continue on to our next hotel, 1 hour away. We were both feeling really beat up and I didn't think I would have the energy to do the drive much later. I told her in the VM that I'd pay for her to Uber to the hotel; just tell me how much it was.

  
At around 10 PM, Valerie called me, furious. It took her over 13 hours to hike up, and she almost didn't make it. She was suffering from sunstroke. She said she could have died because we abandoned her, and we were really selfish not to stay with her.

77,1fdftz7,AITAH for spending $50 ,"On mobile so sorry for format.  So as the title says I spent $50 at the dispensary. A little back story I (33f) am disabled and my spouse J (33m) is the main bread winner. I do work part time at a school twice a week but my income is basically zero. I don’t receive disability or SSDI because of J’s pay and lack of credit history. I have been a sahm since our oldest was born 10 years ago due to childcare cost and lack of family help. Due to an attempt I had two and half years ago J asked me to communicate every purchase I make so he can do the math and know where we are at and in turn I asked not to be involved in the finances because it was a major trigger. This has worked for the most part with me getting more involved in money as the last two years has gone on. 

Here is where I might be the AH. I asked J yesterday if I could spend $50 at the dispo that was in my credit card. The card he gave to me and told me had $50 on it and to do what I want for the week with it. He asked if that was what I wanted to use it on and I said yes. He got off work and picked me up. Once in the car he kept saying he thought I had weed left and it would last me to Friday. I had on Thursday spent $63 on an 8th and a 5 pack of prerolls. He then kept saying how he thought I would spend it on lunch for me or gas station snacks. Telling me we are tight. This is where I think I messed up. I said “I don’t understand where all the money is going.” That went on to him thinking I thought he was spending it all and him pulling up the bank account. We only have $70 to last us until Thursday. I noticed he had spent $20 on lunch for himself which is fine but pointed out how I ask and communicate every dollar I spend. How every time I do go to the dispo I ask and he always says yes that’s fine and will give me $60 here and $40 there. The last he communicated with me was we are tight but I have the $50 do with as I want. Which I did. It turned into a fight because he never really spends money on himself and we have spent $250 at the Dispo in the last two weeks. Every cent he has said was okay to spend. I know the money is going to food and bills and it’s the economy which I told him I knew but he kept bringing up how he thought I would spend the $50 on something different. How I’m not responsible with money. How he never spends money on himself and how is that fair. I try to get him to get himself stuff. He won’t. If i would have known we only had $70 I wouldn’t have used my credit card and the $50. So am I the AH? 

ETA: I’m not clueless of our finances. I am the one that pays the bills and buys the food. I’m the one that gets the kids school supplies. What I mean by not being involved and it a trigger is I was constantly checking the account and worried about every cent to the point it drove me crazy. I just asked to be told if we are low or can’t do something this week. If he had told me the $50 was in his math and NOT to do with it what I want I wouldn’t have spent it. All our bills and food is ALWAYS paid and bought before weed. I am a full time wheelchair user and use it because it has gotten me off medication and opioids. 

I do agree $250 is a lot and didn’t realize that is what I spent and definitely see myself as the AH for that. I’ve just been buying pre rolls and 8ths. I can look into deals and not buy pre rolls and make my own.

During high school, we were in the same friend group and whilst the group drifted apart, Emily and I stayed close friends. We are in uni now and catch up nearly every weekend, and I am so grateful to have a friend like her. 

University break is coming up and Emily's parents have a holiday house that is a short road trip away. A few weeks ago, Emily suggested that we, along with her twin sister and her sister's best friend (who both were also in our high school friend group) stay at the holiday house for a relaxing getaway. 

It is relevant to mention that Emily is also good friends with another girl from our high school, Sophia. Sophia was in a different friend group. I was never really friends with Sophia because we just didn't ""click"", but we were always friendly to each other. At times, Sophia acted quite passive-aggressive towards me and acted in a much nicer manner to my other friends. I always wondered why she behaved like this, because I was never anything but nice to her. 

I do not care who Emily is friends with because that is her choice. I have seen Sophia a handful of times over the last year at parties, and Emily knows we do not keep in contact. When Sophia is around Emily and me, she makes it a point to exclude me from conversations, which is just rude.

Emily asked me if she should invite Sophia to come away with us too, and I told her that I don't think she should. I explained that because her sister and her sister's best friend are the only other people coming, having Sophia there would make it an uneven dynamic. I know that if Sophia was to come, it would totally ruin the trip for me as the whole time it would feel like she is competing for Emily's attention and excluding me. I just worry that maybe I am acting a bit overbearing and should just let Emily decide without my input.

79,1fdfrfl,AITA for telling my mom to listen to the therapist or I won't keep going to therapy with her?,"My mom and I (16f) are in therapy together. She wanted it to include my sister (18) but my sister told her she has nothing she wants to work on in therapy. I didn't get a choice at first but I was okay with going to therapy with mom. I know we have a lot of stuff to address and some of it has been addressed already but my mom keeps shutting down the therapist while refusing to listen and it's getting harder to see the point of family therapy. Mom refuses to meet with the therapist 1:1 and since a session where we spilled our guts she's talking over the therapist a lot and trying to make me feel the way she does. She wants my sister to feel the way she does too.

I should explain stuff. My dad's dead. My mom got married again. I was 7 and my sister was 9 when we lost dad and we were 10 and 12 when mom got married again. In the weeks before the wedding mom said she'd never been happier, she'd never been really in love before, how she found her true love, her soul mate, how he was perfect and the best partner and father ever. Her husband has no kids just so you guys know. My sister and I didn't like hearing her talk like dad, because dad. She was still married to him when he died and we thought they were happy. Mom talked like her husband was the best person to ever exist. She always talks about him in such a positive light still. Nobody can think he has flaws. We don't agree and we're not close to him. 

Mom didn't like us not getting closer to her husband and she always called him our dad. We fought with her a lot and we rejected him when he'd reach out to get closer to us. I try to stay nice or whatever when I talk to him. But I also don't try to make him someone I'm close to or trust or would confide in. I guess it's an issue for him and mom's marriage and with my sister not speaking to either of them since she moved out in May, mom went into ""save my marriage"" mode.

During the spill your guts session I admitted that it hurt to hear mom talk about her husband like he was better than dad, that she calls him my dad. That part of why I refuse to let him in is because I feel like someone needs to stay loyal to dad and love him the best. Mom said her husband is a better man than dad. He's older, dad was young and never got a great job, made her work and they were together for us. But her husband is so much better and can offer us more. That he's better for her because he's a real man. She also said we shouldn't care so much about dad's feelings because he's dead or some weird loyalty to him. She said he doesn't need it. But she wouldn't answer when asked to put herself in those shoes.

Mom pushes more than ever now to get me to love her husband and to think he's better than dad. And with her basically ignoring the therapist I told her she needs to start listening or I won't go anymore. Mom said it's not my call and only children run away like that.

In the weeks before the wedding mom said she'd never been happier, she'd never been really in love before, how she found her true love, her soul mate, how he was perfect and the best partner and father ever. Her husband has no kids just so you guys know. My sister and I didn't like hearing her talk like dad, because dad. She was still married to him when he died and we thought they were happy. Mom talked like her husband was the best person to ever exist. She always talks about him in such a positive light still. Nobody can think he has flaws. We don't agree and we're not close to him. 

Mom didn't like us not getting closer to her husband and she always called him our dad. We fought with her a lot and we rejected him when he'd reach out to get closer to us. I try to stay nice or whatever when I talk to him. But I also don't try to make him someone I'm close to or trust or would confide in. I guess it's an issue for him and mom's marriage and with my sister not speaking to either of them since she moved out in May, mom went into ""save my marriage"" mode.

During the spill your guts session I admitted that it hurt to hear mom talk about her husband like he was better than dad, that she calls him my dad. That part of why I refuse to let him in is because I feel like someone needs to stay loyal to dad and love him the best. Mom said her husband is a better man than dad. He's older, dad was young and never got a great job, made her work and they were together for us. But her husband is so much better and can offer us more. That he's better for her because he's a real man. She also said we shouldn't care so much about dad's feelings because he's dead or some weird loyalty to him. She said he doesn't need it. But she wouldn't answer when asked to put herself in those shoes.

Mom pushes more than ever now to get me to love her husband and to think he's better than dad. And with her basically ignoring the therapist I told her she needs to start listening or I won't go anymore. Mom said it's not my call and only children run away like that.

80,1fdfels,"AITA for threatening to throw out my sisters ""support animal"" ","My (28F) sister (18F) has been living with me for the past year after going through some very difficult personal things. I’ve been trying my best to support her, and while she doesn’t work, she’s in uni full-time, which I’m fine with since I don’t need her to contribute financially ( I can manage my mortgage on my own and have a good income).

A few months ago, she begged me to get a pet, saying it would help her emotionally as a support animal. After considering it, we decided on a dwarf bunny, which we got last month. My main conditions were that I didn’t want any damage to the house or mess, and she promised to train the bunny and handle all the care and cleaning. Initially, she did a lot of research and was doing well. The bunny is actually quite friendly with us, and it's cute to see her jumping/hoping around

However, my sister soon decided it was cruel to lock the bunny up at night, so she let it roam freely in her room. This eventually escalated to the bunny having free reign of the entire house. It now jumps on the couch, tables, and even me, which sounds cute until it pees on my blanket while laying on my lap. Despite my efforts to discourage it, the bunny isn’t intimidated and keeps jumping on my couch. I upgraded my furniture less than a year ago, and I’m worried about it getting ruined.

On top of that, my sister removed the fluffy carpet in her room because the bunny was attempting to eat it, and now there are pee stains on the inbuilt carpet. Yesterday was the final straw when I woke up to find poop and pee all over. While my sister cleans up regularly, I’m concerned that it’s not thorough, and I worry about the lingering smell attracting bugs.

I told her that unless the bunny is potty trained, she can’t keep it and that I’d give it to our cousin, who has other animals. My sister was devastated, started crying, saying I can’t take the bunny away after letting her get attached and that potty training takes time/ bunny needs to be old enough to be de-sexed. She also insists that keeping the bunny locked up at night is cruel. It breaks my heart seeing her this upset but I feel it’s the only solution for now.

I'm a chap who's going to be turning 30 in a few months and I'm really not looking forward to it.

As such, I really don't want to celebrate my birthday and I don't want others to acknowledge it.

I'm not adverse to the idea of celebrating my birthday if there was something worth celebrating, but with 30 being something of a milestone, family (my Dad and Stepmum in particular) appear to be planning something.

I have told them time and time again that if they do want to grant me one birthday wish, it is that they ignore the occasion and go about their day like any other.

I know I sound like an ungrateful prick, but I hate the idea of it being considered a big occasion. For me, 30 is meant to be a fresh start, a clean slate if you will, but celebrating my birthday is going to make me feel tremendously down and just remind me what a write-off my 20s were.

Truly, I wish to just take some time off from work and perhaps spend a week by myself exploring a city I haven't been to like Prague, or Berlin.

I know that my family are going to ignore my wishes all the same and at the very least call me and try to give me presents. I'd rather they just give the money spent on such presents to charity and be done with it. 

The few friends I have are overseas and haven't contacted me in some time, so I'm not motivated to have a party of any kind. I don't have a spouse, so I really would rather just not be the centre of attention and go off somewhere and do something I enjoy doing by myself.

What say you folks, am I being unreasonable, especially of I just ignore the calls and messages I'll inevitability get that day and explicitly tell my loved ones to leave me alone that day in advance?

SD goes to an advanced school (this has caused issues in the past) and recently got offered to a fast-track program where she learns algebra 2 and calculus at the same time. 

I have 2 issues with this. First my son is only in algebra 2 and already struggling, having his little sister in a higher math class than him is going to negatively affect his confidence. Second it's going to set up unrealistic expectations for my younger 2 to follow and they might feel jealous.

My husband and his ex-wife were sat down and talked to this a week ago at SD's school and when my husband told me about this, I told him my concerns about my kids as to why I think my SD shouldn't join because of the affects on my kids.

He said he would look into it which I interpretated as he won't move her but just a few days ago after dinner, SD was telling us about her new math class, the fast-track one. Of course I was angry and talked to my husband after dinner about this. He said it was in SD's best needs and said gifted kids having more needs and not being a choice between us but him and his ex. At this point, I was fed up. He constantly puts his child's needs over mine's wellbeing.

When SD got accepted into the high school, I didn't want her to go because of the affects on my children. My husband overrode my concerns. I don't want SD talking about her school too often because of the same reason, but my husband decided to go out of his way to talk about it.

There's more instances like this but these are some most noticeable ones. Each decision my husband makes about SD can affect my kids' confidence and self-esteem but he never gives concern to that. I just feel unheard and lashed out on him because of it.

We had an argument yesterday in which they basically said ""fuck off leave"" to me when i was in their flat. We messaged and called throughout the day and didnt resolve it. At some point they write ""Im vomiting and i cant breathe"" and then ""Ich breche zusammen"" (in german) which basically means a mixture out of breaking down and being so weak that you cant stand and probably laying on the floor.

(They had shown symptoms like that before, which so far didnt have lasting consequences (but had at least short term health consequences). And once when i was with them they told me to not call an ambulance cause their flat is a mess and their neighbours are nosy and rude.)

  
I saw the message 5 mins later and responded and tried to call her (since im 1 hour away). She repeatedly doesnt respond so im like fuck what do i do. So I call the ambulance and tell them what she wrote and they drive to her flat to have a look.

  
They are a  teacher and turns out they went to her weekly course and decided not to respond and ignore me since they didnt want to talk to me (due to the argument like an hour before) after dropping those 2 messages.

Ambulance had to break the door down and replace the lock (obviously she wasnt there).

But basically they told me im insane and that i should pay for a new lock and 5 new keys and that they want to end the relationship because of that.

  
Am I an asshole for being angry and saying no?

Happy to provide further detail",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITA Ambulance called and blamed for costs of new lock Hey there, so situation is as follows: my SO has severe symptoms to stress and arguments. We had an argument yesterday in which they basically said ""fuck off leave"" to me when i was in their flat. We messaged and called throughout the day and didnt resolve it. At some point they write ""Im vomiting and i cant breathe"" and then ""Ich breche zusammen"" (in german) which basically means a mixture out of breaking down and being so weak that you cant stand and probably laying on the floor.

(They had shown symptoms like that before, which so far didnt have lasting consequences (but had at least short term health consequences). And once when i was with them they told me to not call an ambulance cause their flat is a mess and their neighbours are nosy and rude.)

  
I saw the message 5 mins later and responded and tried to call her (since im 1 hour away). She repeatedly doesnt respond so im like fuck what do i do. So I call the ambulance and tell them what she wrote and they drive to her flat to have a look.

  
They are a  teacher and turns out they went to her weekly course and decided not to respond and ignore me since they didnt want to talk to me (due to the argument like an hour before) after dropping those 2 messages.

90,1fdckfu,AITA; moved out before lease end/didn't contact ex again,"Tldr at end. 

I always felt this was a 50/50 split of assholery, but my friend has the opposite happen to her and everyone agreed he was the asshole, and started questioning me about my story. Now I'm doubting myself and my judgement for future relationships. 

Long story short, ~a year ago my ex-bf (26m) broke up with me (25f)while we rented an apartment. We had a 2bed/2bath, the master having bathroom attached. The second room was his office. 

When we broke up, he moved all of his office to the living room and I moved into the second room. Within a week, he began staying with his ""friend"" every night. I saw him maybe once a week for like 20 mins at most as he moved things out of the apartment slowly. 

After a couple of months of being alone, I was depressed and panicking so I called him, told him I was moving out, and asked if he wanted any of the furniture I brought (all the big stuff.  I had an apartment previously but he lived at home. We bought the couch together) he did not. I got all of the furniture, non parishables, and even the cutlery/pora and pans he didn't want given away and out of the house. I took whatever else I wanted/fit in the rental. 

I cleaned the guest room, bathroom, kitchen and living room. I made sure not to touch any of his things. His parents even came over to observe for a while, and take a few things. 

I informed the office of the situation, paid my half of the remaining rent directly to them, and gave my ex a sum of money I owed him in cash. Then I left. 

When the lease ended at the end of the year (I left in summer) he started messaging me asking me to pay him for cleaning the apartment and ""fees"". I ignored and blocked.


TL:DR; my ex broke up with me and moved halfway in with his new partner, so I paid my half of the remaining rent (about 3 months left in lease) took my shit and left. He contacted me about cleaning fees/ect but I ignored him

91,1fdcacd,AITA for not prioritizing my mother.. ,"I don't want to help my mother

My mom and I have always had a terrible relationship. She abused me when I was a child. I was sent to live with my dad, etc etc. 
When I was 10, she had another kid, my brother, whom I love endlessly. She was on drugs and in the streets, so I (with the help of aunts and uncles) raised my brother. He thought I was his mom as he got older. Of course, he grew to know the truth, but anyway.

He is 27, lives with her, pays no bills, contributes in no way, and yes, he works. I am a mom of 2, freshly divorced, on disability (so I'm unable to work) and just getting my bearings.

I have come to understand that the person my mom used to be, she is no longer.  I don't have any hate or disdain toward her. We have a good relationship for most parts. Amends have been made. 

Here's my problem.  Every time she has a problem, she bothers and bugs the hell out of me. She has a boyfriend who just proposed, and a grown live-in son..  Why are you calling me for help when they are there?
 
Example: she calls me 8 times while I'm in class because she doesn't feel well. I ask her for symptoms so I can help determine if she needs to go to urgent care. She complains and complains and I ask, do you want to go to urgent care? She says yes, come get me....Ummmm, no ""where's your man and your son"", her reply is that they're in the room...THAN WHY ARE YOU HARRASSING MEEEEE? They both drive; they are both competent. Why are you asking me to drive 40 minutes to take you 30 minutes away to urgent care when you have to able bodied adults right under you? 

Example 2:  She calls because my brother had used all of the tissue and drank all of the water. I ask her if she's said something to him; she responds no and asks me not to say anything. She then asks me to bring her some water and tissue. No. Just no. Your grown son should be replenishing what he used. Why am I responsible for that? Why can't one of them go get some or take you? 

Example 3: Her Rx needs to be picked up. My brother works next to the pharmacy. She's mad because I don't offer to drive 40 minutes to pick up a rx that's 5 minutes from her home and 30 seconds from my brother's job, which he's at. 

AITA? I use want to say no. I don't mind doing anything but utilize your resources, my gawd! 

Note: I want to clarify that I have been with my dad since the age of 11 and on my own since 19. My mom was not a contributing factor in my life in most capacities. Even so, I love her, and the past has no bearing on why I don't feel like always helping her.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITA for not prioritizing my mother..  I don't want to help my mother

94,1fdblm7,AITA For not shaking my dad’s girlfriend’s hand?,"I (21F), my brother (25M) & my mom (53F) were out at a restaurant to celebrate her birthday. We sat outside the restaurant in the porch area. The place is located in a busy area, (it’s a strip of stores & restaurants). We were able to see tons of people walking by the restaurant. 

As we were sitting, I saw a man & a woman walking in our direction. The 1st thing I noticed was 1.) The woman is wearing a short, tight black dress, & 2.) The guy looks like my dad. I don’t have the best eyesight but I did have my glasses on, & I was 90% sure that it was my dad. My brother immediately noticed him. My dad made eye contact with us & that is when my mom noticed him as well.

For context, my parents have been divorced for a year now. The divorce was messy & was one of the worst parts of my life that I’ve had to go through. Now, however, my parents are cordial with each other, but they do it for the sake of my brother & I.

I just want to preface that my dad is honestly not a good person (lol) & did a lot of terrible shit to my mom that I won’t get into. 

So, my dad & the woman come over & I’m experiencing emotions that I’ve NEVER felt before. My entire body was actually trembling. She proceeded to introduce herself, but it went over my head. She then shook my mom’s hand, & shook my brother’s hand, & when she turned to me, I just stared at her & didn’t shake her hand. She proceeded to say “Oh okay, I see” in the most bitchiest tone ever, I’m not even exaggerating.

The entire time my dad was talking to my mom, who was being extremely nice & friendly, this lady had her hands ALL OVER him. I couldn’t even look at them, & my brother wasn’t uttering a single word. 

My dad then ended the conversation by waving dramatically & saying “Alright my Smiths!” (For privacy reasons I used a fake last name). For more context, my mom kept my dad’s last name because she is a teacher & felt like it would be easier for her students & coworkers if she kept the same name. Take it how you want, but we found that statement to be rather condescending & weird.

Also, I had spoken to my dad on the phone earlier that day & I told him about our plans to go eat at that place. So he knew that we were going to be there, & he knew that he could potentially run into us. 

I haven’t spoken to my dad yet. However, minutes after they left, he sent my brother a text containing the emoji with 1 eye peeking through its hands. 

I feel like if she had a bit more decorum & didn’t act the way she did, then I would have been a bit nicer to her. My dad, at the very least, could have just continued walking on. That’s what all 3 of us wished he would’ve done in that situation.

I obviously have no control over my parent’s dating lives. I just don’t particularly want to have any involvement with who they see (unless it gets very serious). I’ve even made this very clear to both of my parents, & they are both aware of how serious I am about this.

96,1fdbe1b,AITA for kicking somebody out of my car after they called it “ a shitty ass car”?,"So the other day, my friends and I were heading out to a very popular arcade place, and I was the one to pick them up and drive because why not? I have my full licence and am the most experienced. Now, being a university student, I am thankful to have a car in the first place. It’s a 2007 civic. It drives well, it’s great on gas, saves me money on insurance, and gets me from point A to point B safely with no troubles for the most part. I personally don’t care that it’s old, if it gets me somewhere without a hassle, I am more than happy. 



Now, I went to pickup my friends and it turns out that one of them was bringing a plus one. I didn’t mind this of course, the more the merrier. Unfortunately, they turned out to be really disrespectful. As my friends partner was getting in the car, he commented about how this was a “shitty ass car”.  


Without hesitation, I turned around and told him to get out. He looked at me for a second and tried to apologize, but I was not having it. His girlfriend also got out of the car and I took the rest of our friends home. A few hours later, I got a huge wall of text saying that I overreacted and that it “wasn’t that deep.” I responded by saying that beggars simply can’t be choosers and that this is just like a homeless man complaining about sleeping at his friends shack. Thankfully, his partner did come around and eventually agreed with my point of view, but did not agree with my reaction.

It drives well, it’s great on gas, saves me money on insurance, and gets me from point A to point B safely with no troubles for the most part. I personally don’t care that it’s old, if it gets me somewhere without a hassle, I am more than happy. 



Now, I went to pickup my friends and it turns out that one of them was bringing a plus one. I didn’t mind this of course, the more the merrier. Unfortunately, they turned out to be really disrespectful. As my friends partner was getting in the car, he commented about how this was a “shitty ass car”.  


Without hesitation, I turned around and told him to get out. He looked at me for a second and tried to apologize, but I was not having it. His girlfriend also got out of the car and I took the rest of our friends home. A few hours later, I got a huge wall of text saying that I overreacted and that it “wasn’t that deep.” I responded by saying that beggars simply can’t be choosers and that this is just like a homeless man complaining about sleeping at his friends shack. Thankfully, his partner did come around and eventually agreed with my point of view, but did not agree with my reaction. 


So Reddit, aita?


Edit: Hello everyone, I was reading through the comments and thought I would address something here real quick. After the situation happened, it unfortunately ruined everybody’s mood and thus is the reason why I took everybody home. It wasn’t my decision. I also addressed this in a reply to a comment earlier, but it has been buried.",0.0,0.04234334081411362,0,1
97,1fdbcax,AITA For Ghosting My Friend After They Were Kicked Out Of My House?,"Up until a month ago, my friend (18NB) was living with me (18M) for nearly a year. Me and my parents took them in because their home life was very toxic. We wanted to help them by giving them a safe space to finish high school. My parents had a few conditions for them to stay.

They had to quit smoking pot. They needed to pay rent, I don’t quite know the details but it was roughly $200 per fortnight. They had to attend school and graduate. They had to participate in the household.

Whenever anything in their life went wrong, they would relapse. It was a constant cycle of relapsing then promising not to relapse again. One time, they said that they would never smoke again if I would do it with them and I did. And they did it again a month later. It got to the point where they would go back to their old house just to smoke, and lie to me about it. I had to ask their boyfriend where they were. I even went as far as to lie about it to my parents.

They were also consistently late on rent payments. They had three different sources of income, one from their parents, one from their job and one from a youth allowance from the government. And yet, they were always broke because they spent money on things like unnecessary Ubers or alcohol.

As for attending school, it was fine for a few months, then they started to skip again. At some points, they would tell my parents that they were going to school, but they would just not. And when their marks naturally started to fall, I felt like I had to help them study. 

Their room was always disgusting. They would leave food around for days and only clean it up when my parents asked them to. One time, when my mum was cleaning their room, she found ants and half eaten food down the side of their bed. They would have to be harassed to do any chores at all and would often talk back about it.

All that to say, about a month ago, me and my parents had finally had enough. They had gone to their old house and relapsed. I was already so angry at them and I felt like they had used us. So when we had the conversation about what to do with them, I didn’t try to convince my parents to let them stay like I normally did. 

I felt so drained by them. I felt like I had given everything I could and they hadn’t cared about any of it. To me, they had used me and my parents, I felt hurt. I knew that they would be upset by this, and I felt awful that I was sending them back to their old abusive house, but I had given everything

And for a month, I didn’t want to talk to them. I didn’t want to even explain why I left because I knew that the second I did, I would crumble and immediately rush to their side. I am coming to this subreddit because I feel awful about leaving without an explanation. I didn’t know how to say “sorry for leaving you when you were at your worst lol, but I am still pissed at you so pls never talk to me again.” Without hurting them. And I was scared.

98,1fdaw2z,AITA for moving our second car away from the house after my Wife refused to pay for it?,"My Wife and I have always only had 1 car until recently. We have a toddler, so she's been mostly a SAH parent to save on childcare cost until preschool, just working a couple times a week here and there for spending money. She brings in around $1,000 a month doing this. I cover all the bills, and I've gotten a few raises and promotions over the past couple years, but not enough to handle 2 car payments. 

My Wife has been wanting a car to get around while I'm at work; shopping, events for our kid during the day, etc. I did the math, and told her we can only get a second car if she helps pay for some of it, otherwise I can't afford to pay for it on my own. We were already leasing a newer SUV at the time that she loved and I didn't really care for, so we agreed that she'd cover a $400 monthly payment and I'd cover insurance, gas, maintenance, etc. She was fine with the plan and agreed.

I spent some weeks looking around, then went and bought a car I liked. Now we have two vehicles. I didn't have to pay for the first 60 days on the new car, so let my Wife ""save up money"" while I continued paying for the SUV payments. 60 days later, Wife tells me she only has $300 of the $400 and is upset that I expect her to pay for the car she agreed to pay for. I just have her send the $300, cover the difference, and remind her that I can't afford two cars, so it's important she budgets the money she earns properly. Keep in mind, she has NO bills aside from like a credit card. The next week, she ran over something in the road and destroyed one of the tires, so I keep up my end and get the tire replaced and another tire patched for a couple hundred bucks. 

Next month rolls by and it comes time for the next payment. I remind my Wife payment is coming due and she simply responds, ""I'm not paying it."" At this point, it's become pretty clear that she had no intent to pay after she paid the $300 from the previous month, continuing to express that she shouldn't have  to pay. I start talking to her about accountability (which she absolutely hated), and told her I'll have to take the car away because she didn't fulfill her end of the agreement, which she didn't dispute. 

When I got home, I cleaned the SUV out and took it away from the house to a safe location.  When I got back home my Wife was livid. We are now back to one vehicle, which she has full access to when I'm not at work. She has not spoken to me since I took the car away (about a week) and refuses to drive the car we have. She has been calling Ubers or her friends/family to take her places. 

It really just seems like a big accountability problem to me, but I spoke with a couple family members about it and one believes I'm justified while the other believes I'm dead wrong.

99,1fdarzh,WIBTA if I told my ex's mom why we really broke up?,"I’m a 39-year-old nb, and my partner of 10 years, who is M 35, broke up with me yesterday. 

Backstory: When we first got together, I was polyamorous, and he wanted to be monogamous. I was okay with this arrangement, and for years, our relationship was filled with laughter and care. However, things started to get tough when he was laid off from work. He didn’t communicate this possibility, fair, but this is the beginning of a pattern.

He felt shame, and broke up with me for a few months thinking his unhappiness was due to us. 

I took him back & paid for him to go to coding boot camp and covered most of our expenses. He then got a good paying job he likes.

The dynamic changed again when I lost my job, which I loved, as my father was dying. I took on a new, demanding job with a toxic boss, which sent me into a depression.

We had started trying to get pregnant, and during routine tests, I discovered I had chlamydia. Confused, I found out he had slept with someone else during our breakup. I was upset he didn’t get tested or treated before we resumed having unprotected sex. His lack of transparency hurt deeply.

He took a trip to another city and confessed he flirted and danced/grinded with a girl. I felt insecure. I asked him to work on making me feel safe, instead he began focusing on my shortcomings, particularly how my depression made me a less attentive partner and housemate.

We went to couples counseling, where he would rant about my shortcomings nearly the entire session, without my insecurity ever being addressed. I later discovered he had continued to message the girl he flirted with, and even went to her place after promising not to spend time with her. 

He also met IRL a longtime internet friend who seemed indifferent towards me, but was very intense about him. He wanted to visit her without me, so I expressed my concerns about their relationship, but he reassured me they were just friends. Months after the trip, I found out he and his friend had held hands, kissed, and had been chatting about dating ever since.

When I asked him to stop communicating with her until we resolved things with our counselor, he initially agreed. However, in the middle of the night, he broke up with me, claiming he hadn’t been happy for a long time and wasn’t sure if he still loved me. 

Back to now: he told his mom we were breaking up because he didn’t like how we fought.

I’m hurt and furious, it’s one more twist of the knife. Once again he’s lying to try to shift the blame onto me and avoid accountability.

For backstory, my younger sister who is 18 used to have an ED a few years ago and was hospitalized for it, it was a very dark time for our family as my sister was extremely sick mentally. She has been recovered for a while now but obviously, our family is very familiar with eating disorders and their symptoms. I have a long history of mental illness myself (major depression, OCD, and anxiety) and after an upsetting year at college and a lot of triggering events and by the time I got home for summer, I was pretty emotionally shattered and was using substances to cope. My mom encouraged me to get back onto medication for my mental health which I decided would be a good idea so I got started on Wellbutrin. One of the main side effects of Wellbutrin is loss of appetite. While I have always been a healthy weight, I have always struggled with body image especially because my mom and my sister are very thin and I am significantly more curvy in comparison (I also gained a bit of weight during the school year due to my drinking habits). Once the medication started kicking in I had a lot more energy to exercise and have had a pretty significant loss of appetite however I still eat regularly and have a perfectly healthy diet. I have definitely lost a bit of weight, probably around 10 pounds since getting on the medication. About a week ago my mom said she needed to have a ""talk"" with me. She told me that what I was doing was ""dangerous"" and she was concerned just because I stopped snacking as much and she wasn't seeing me ""properly nourish my body"". I assured her that I was fine and the eating was just a symptom of the medication but then she started lashing out at me and telling me that if I continued this ""behavior"" she was going to take away my car so I couldn't take it with me to college, and threatened to take away other things. She made me feel extremely guilty and started telling me how our family was ""traumatized"" by my sister's struggles and it would be wrong to make my family go through that again even after I told her I was perfectly fine. Now she has been trying to control my diet and forcefully get me to eat more which I find extremely bothersome as she will come into my room and start asking me what I am going to eat aggressively. I feel bad because it is something she worries about but trying to punish me for eating less feels wrong to me.

I can't speak for my dad, but I'm pissed at her. Had a few months passed, I wouldn't have been. But that dog I loved hasn't even been dead for two weeks. While I'm fairly certain this may not have been the intention, it really feels like he got replaced.

104,1fd9q9z,AITA for not speaking out over Bigotry,"Senior in high school here. The year's been tough, with college apps, creating my portfolio, taking my ACT, and my AP classes.

Speaking of AP classes, Korean is really draining. I love the subject, but our teacher is a snippy guy and the coursework is rigorous. What's more, I have to pass this class, since I plan on studying language in the future. The moment I sit down in this class, Korean is really all I think about. I barely even talk to the kids around me.

I especially avoid this one guy who's made it his mission to be a major douchebag to every minority that dares to exist. He says a litany of slurs carelessly, but excessively around those who aren't affected by the slurs, in this case, me. In casual (one sided) conversation at me, he'll drop ableist and colorist slurs, and complain about his own skin tone keeping girls away from him (it's probably his shitty personality). It makes me uncomfortable, but I don't say anything. I know what he's like to people who don't like him. I've seen him pester and nag people to no end, trying to debate them and considering himself the winner when they don't want to talk to him. The thought of dealing with him in Korean horrifies me. I'll genuinely drop the class if he starts antagonizing me (our seats are assigned.)

When he gets weird, I start talking to someone else in Korean, or just act really curt with him.

Recently, some of my disabled friends have noticed me at the table group and pointed out that I don't do anything to stop him, despite having the privilege to. They're saying I'm facilitating his behavior. I definitely see how my actions can count as being complicit in what he's doing.

The only way I've justified my actions to myself is because of the class I'm in. It's a tough academic environment where I either thrive or die, and causing chaos or having to explain basic human decency to him mid-class is not something I have the energy to do. I don't want to sit next to someone who hates my guts all year. I've already talked to some anonymous school tip lines about his behavior. I don't know what other steps to say.

I'm gay, non Muslim and I drink alcohol and pork. My parents are Muslim. They are not aware of this but will do terrible things to me if they knew. 

Outwardly they object to me moving out (I'm 18) because I am seen as incapable for uni since I had mental health issues during year 13 (last year of American highschool) and had poor attendance but I believe in uni I will do well. 

This is because I am studying a subject I enjoy, it is graded based off of assigned essays not exams (I got an A* in my English coursework but a C in exams) and because I need pressure to grow as a person. If I am babied around I will not grow because I can continue to cope and not develop but I need the pressure of me potentially starving if I don't cook. It will help me develop a routine.  I am also more socially mature so anxiety won't stop me from coming in to lectures etc. 

Their belief I will do poorly is solely based on how I did with both depression and anxiety weighing me down during year 13. I did extremely well in previous exams getting an A* and 4 As out of 7 subject in comparison to BCD in year 13 although they were significsntky easier but i studied very well and am capable I just need an environment to be myself and to not feel depressed because I'm having to repress what I truly am.

The true reason they object is because they worry I will lose my religion as uni is very oriented on drinking culture and drugs. They are also aware I've had an ex boyfriend and are worried about me exploring my sexuality even further. This seems like manipulation trying to control what I do and limiting my growth. 

Also there's financial abuse because if I stay then my mum will take all of my loans and not give me a single penny. Instead I'd ask for permission to get transferred the money. 

My mum is clinically depressed and I'm not sure what she will do when I do leave. That's what caused me to make the post cause I'm premptively  guilty.

108,1fd9g8z,AITA for not purchasing my fiancé’s weed,"Backstory: My fiancé and I have been together for just over 3 years. When we first started going out he had been on a break from weed (although I was unaware at the time.) When I enlisted he started it back up again, this was 2021, then in 2022 he quit is meds cold turkey which led to drug induced psychosis and a hospital stay. He swore off weed which lasted like 3 months before he picked it right back up again. He smoked heavily from the end of 2022, all the way through 2023 before quitting cold turkey in Jan 2024 which also induced psychosis and led to another hospital stay. Once again he swore off of it however this time only lasted a month before he was smoking again. At first it was ‘oh I’ll smoke just in the weekends’ then weekends turned into Fri-Mon, then it became ‘oh I’ll smoke after work once I’ve done all my chores’ which worked for like 2 weeks before it became a chain smoke day in day out again. 

My current issue is that he’ll spend whatever he can to get more and then try and justify and deny that he’s doing exactly that. He has no savings, no emergency money and after payday has only $0 in his account. Our joint savings has nothing and at this point I’m lucky if he doesn’t put weed before a roof over our heads more often than not. Right now we have some funds in the joint account due to moving house and having a bond returned. The original deal was that he could get some weed with whatever’s left as flights need to be purchased for a trip to Melbourne for his birthday (pearl jam tickets, his dad organised) but now it’s oh can I transfer the money so he doesn’t touch the bond money and he will pay it back. But he barely earns enough for rent. 

He has acknowledged his addiction, I’ve acknowledged he’s addicted which is why I don’t contribute my personal finances to it. His psychologist acknowledges the addiction but also acknowledges that it makes him happy and all she’s asked is that he cuts down. Which essentially was his green light to continue how he has been. 

I wouldn’t say I’m the AH, I would say I’m helping by not buying into it. But he just gets so sad every time he asks and is mad for a few hours and sort of looks at me like a wounded puppy. 

For some extra context: he has anxiety which is half of why he smokes and possibly undiagnosed or semi diagnose bipolar. He hasn’t been diagnosed with depression but definitely has some tendencies. His medication is directly related to anxiety and mood disorders.

110,1fd8xh8,AITA for wanting bring my son with me for a round of golf.,"Using a burner because ya know…

I need your guys input on a stupid argument my wife and I had yesterday. Essentially I was invited by 3 friends to play a casual round of golf.  By no means are we good (lucky to break 100) but we all enjoy the game and each other’s company.   We all would have paid for our green fees and other costs ourselves.  

I have recently started trying to introduce the game to my son and I thought it would be cool to bring him along, share a cart with me, and maybe have him hit a few balls in between my shots.  I also  thought it would allow my wife some well deserved alone time.   

Well when I shared my idea with her of bringing my son along she instantly started to get annoyed at the fact I would even consider doing that and by my son being there, I was somehow breaking some social understanding with my buddies that it was a guys only outing and that I was being selfish for considering this.  I was completely blindsided by her reaction and couldn’t understand why it was so triggering to her.  She kept saying that it was cringe of me to assume it was ok to bring our son along when the others weren’t brining their kids…that I was invited to the outing and it’s inappropriate for me to have our son there.  I told her that I would have run it by the other 3 friends first if it was cool and that I was once the kid joining a round of golf with my dad way back when and it was no big deal, that’s it’s not like it was during an official tournament.  She got even more upset that I didn’t see her point and that I was playing dumb and gaslighting her.   

She said that the outing was clearly an adults only thing and that while to others in the group would probably be ok with it or at least tell me it’s cool, it was wrong of me to assume it was even a possibility.  I told her that I completely understand if it was a sit down dinner or a more formal social event that was clearly adults only I wouldn’t even consider this and understand and see her point, but it was just 3 dads playing a round on a Sunday morning.

I guess her point is that since I was invited to play a round of golf and that there were no other kids there it would be wrong of me to bring my son, like I would be messing up the dynamic somehow.

She mentioned a few months ago that she wanted to go to a restaurant, but I’ve been struggling financially, I couldn’t afford to go, I know it’s on me since she mentioned months ago but I had unplanned bills. 

When she asked us for suggestions, I didn’t want her to feel pressured to change her plans for me, but I still suggested a museum because it fit my budget. She rejected the idea immediately, which made me feel hesitant to suggest anything else. She later decided on a restaurant and said she wouldn’t change her plans for anyone. I told her again that I couldn’t afford it but wished her a great time.

That’s when she got upset, saying I didn’t seem interested in celebrating with her and that she didn’t need to accommodate me. I explained calmly that I didn’t want her to change her plans, but I had suggested something earlier. She claimed I never gave specific options, which frustrated me. I snapped and mentioned how I didn’t make a big deal during my own birthday.

Back in April, “A” got sick and couldn’t attend my birthday plans, so we canceled. What really hurt me was that she didn’t try to reschedule or do something later. I wasn’t expecting anything grand, but she didn’t even text me beyond posting an Instagram story. When I mentioned this, she brought up her cat’s death — which happened a month later! It felt like a way to deflect the conversation and manipulate the situation.

Since the semester started, she decided not to enroll in university, and despite promising to visit, she has always found excuses not to come. It feels like she hasn’t been putting much effort into maintaining our friendship unless it suits her.

In the end, I decided not to go to her birthday celebration. I felt bad for not saving up, so I apologized, explaining that I didn’t want her to change her plans for me and that I was struggling financially. I thought this would smooth things over.

Her response was: “It’s okay, don’t worry. I toned things down because I think it’s unfair for the others to be caught in the middle, but mentioning your birthday made me feel like you were taking it out on me. I don’t know if that’s true, but that’s how it came across. I understand you don’t have money, so it’ll be for another time.”

It might sound nice, but honestly, this made me feel worse. It felt like she only held back because of our other friends. Also, the way she mentioned my financial situation felt condescending, and she didn’t apologize for the cat comment.

I explained calmly that I didn’t want her to change her plans, but I had suggested something earlier. She claimed I never gave specific options, which frustrated me. I snapped and mentioned how I didn’t make a big deal during my own birthday.

Back in April, “A” got sick and couldn’t attend my birthday plans, so we canceled. What really hurt me was that she didn’t try to reschedule or do something later. I wasn’t expecting anything grand, but she didn’t even text me beyond posting an Instagram story. When I mentioned this, she brought up her cat’s death — which happened a month later! It felt like a way to deflect the conversation and manipulate the situation.

Since the semester started, she decided not to enroll in university, and despite promising to visit, she has always found excuses not to come. It feels like she hasn’t been putting much effort into maintaining our friendship unless it suits her.

In the end, I decided not to go to her birthday celebration. I felt bad for not saving up, so I apologized, explaining that I didn’t want her to change her plans for me and that I was struggling financially. I thought this would smooth things over.

Her response was: “It’s okay, don’t worry. I toned things down because I think it’s unfair for the others to be caught in the middle, but mentioning your birthday made me feel like you were taking it out on me. I don’t know if that’s true, but that’s how it came across. I understand you don’t have money, so it’ll be for another time.”

It might sound nice, but honestly, this made me feel worse. It felt like she only held back because of our other friends. Also, the way she mentioned my financial situation felt condescending, and she didn’t apologize for the cat comment.

112,1fd8uv4,AITA for ditching my best friend to hangout with my boyfriend the day before she moved across the country ,"AITA for ditching my good friend to hangout with my boyfriend on the day before she moved across the country 

My boyfriend loves his college football team. He has had season tickets for years and never EVER misses a home game. Our alma maters aren’t in the same conference, but scheduled a game against each other. We decided to go to the game. He knows my college friends very well and invited another couple I went to college with to join us. One of the people he invited is my best friend. She said she would love to go to the game but wanted to invite our two other friends because it was her last weekend before moving across the country. My boyfriend agreed and bought tickets for all six of us. He was excited that everyone was going to go to the game with him.

The week before the game I got really sick. On game day I was still taking Tylenol and not feeling great. I suggested we all meet up and get lunch before the game, maybe some sandwiches, and my friends all decided to go to bottomless brunch. At brunch, all my friends get belligerently drunk. My boyfriend then drives everyone to the campus and I tell people to leave their things in the car because the stadium doesn’t allow bags. Everyone is drunk and insists it will be ok.

When we get to the security, they don’t let any of my friends in because they all have large purses. They are told to check their bags at the stadium. All four of my friends declare they are going to leave and not go to the football game because they don’t want to check their bags due to fear of theft and are instead going to a bar. At this point, I’m offended they are blowing off my boyfriend’s plans, but understand they want to keep drinking. In reality, I’m relieved to get away from their loud and drunk behavior. I go to the game with my boyfriend and don’t think much of it. 

Two days later, I see one of my friends and she tells me that I ruined the day by splitting up the group. She says that everyone is mad at me for choosing my boyfriend over my friend who was moving away, and that I was a bad friend for not prioritizing them over him. She said the football game was not important and that I could see my boyfriend anytime I want. My friends are demanding an apology and half of them aren’t speaking to me. So am I being an asshole for not changing my plans, or should I have gone with them?

114,1fd8rp7,AITA to set boundaries w/ friend who oversteps / gives unsolicited advice? ,"My best friend ( 25 F) and I ( 24 F) have been friends since college.  

I love her and truly value our friendship, however, sometimes I feel like she oversteps with her opinions and advice.  
A couple of examples: 

- SHE will bring up things about my relationship, and offer unsolicited advice on how I should handle it (my bf posting me on instagram, but i just don’t care, and she is always bringing it up). 
- When will he propose to me and if he doesn’t by x amount of time, how I should leave and go my own way.  
- if I don’t respond to her texts, she is blowing me up. once she told me she’s gonna do a wellness check on me, because I wasn’t responding. 
 - being jealous about me hanging out with other friends. 
- she  is pushy when it comes to her inviting me to things I don’t wanna do, or don’t have the money to do.  She will comment things like “girl you have the money to go” or “you never wanna do anything outside of your routine”.  I just don’t say yes to EVERYTHING she invites me to.  
- she has made comments about comparing me to her other friends, and how “they’d be so excited for me to invite them to this,” or “if I asked you to go to Vegas with me with a months notice, you would’ve never” 

All of this leads up to last week, when I’m telling her “hey sorry I didn’t get back to you, I had a rough night”. I do not explain further and kinda just leave it at that.  She asks if I’m okay and I told her yes, I just talked to my mom and I’m fine.  

She then goes on to tell me that I need to go to therapy because she thinks I’m developing an anxiety disorder …. Which I do not think is true.  I honestly just cope with life’s ups and downs, and will vent about it. Either way, I was upset that she keeps trying to diagnose me (this happened a couple months ago when she told me she thinks I have seasonal depression) 

So I respond, and I’m like yeah I’ve tried therapy, I’m honestly fine, and don’t have the money to pay for therapy even if I wanted to go.  

Her response to this is , “yes you do… not pocket watching tho”… 
this sent me over the edge because I told her I passed a board exam I had studied so long for, so she knows I make more money now. So it just felt…. Icky for her to say that because she truly doesn’t know what my finances look like.  

I do not respond, and give myself a couple of days to collect my feelings about how this made me feel.
 
I send her videos (something me and all my friends do cause texting is too much) explaining in a very calm and level headed way, that I simple just don’t feel comfortable with her giving unsolicited advice or opinions on my mental health, finances, or my relationship. 

When she does this, I retract within our friendship, and without even trying, makes me not want to be as communicative with her, and I will need breaks from talking to her.

115,1fd8rgi,AITA for not moving into my boyfriend's (26m) apartment because I (26f) don't feel comfortable in the space? ,"

My boyfriend and I have been dating for 1.5 years. The topic of moving in together has come up since I live with my parents and he lives alone but while I was into the idea at first, I realized I would be scraping by financially. It also just isn't a place I could feel at home in since there is a roach infestation, his place is very cluttered with his belongings and furniture, etc. There is no space for my own things and it's visually not a place I would be happy in. 

He stays afloat financially but I also learned that he can afford to live alone because he doesn't budget for a doctor, dentist, car insurance, registration, etc. It seemed like we both can't afford to live together right now so I suggested he move in with his friend. Doing this would cut his expenses by at least 50% so he is in the early stages of planning this, but I feel guilty for making him give up his apartment since I won't move in with him.

 While he wants to save more money, his rent is cheap since the apartment hasn't been rennovated in decades and it feels like if I give up on the opportunity to move in now, we will never find a rent that low ever again. At times it feels like I am being uptight since I refuse to move into his place because it's not a space I feel happy with visually.

 Am I being an asshole or too uptight for not wanting to move into his apartment? He also suggested we move into a room in his friend's 2 bedroom but I also don't want to do that since it's even more cluttered/dirty there and his ex lives in the same building.

116,1fd88i8,AITA for telling my sister she was spoiled for buying 2 pairs of swimmers?,"So I, 17, have a sister, 14F. She's generally pretty good but she can be a bit,.. spoiled or just entitled in a way. She gets pretty full on and angry and generally doesn't listen to my mum to the point my mum can't even get her to listen and do what she's told. As I'm 17, I'm allowed to do certain things she's not but she doesn't understand that. She demands she have what I have and my mum just lets her have it. If I try to tell my mum that its kinda unfair that I had to wait until I was 17 but she just got it the moment she turned 14. 

That brings us to our problem currently. So as I'm 17 and my mum is slightly less strict now (she's Christian so is quite strict with clothing) I asked if I could wear a bralette bikini. Now I was very hesitant to ask her if I could because I knew if I asked, my sister would demand she wear it too, but my mum had assured me she would tell my sister no if she asked and acknowledged that she would sometimes cave but promised she wouldn't this time. Well she ended up caving, more or less. My sister overheard that I was getting one and came in to my mum, asking if she could get it too. She was already ordering a nice one piece online but immediately wanted a bikini too. My mum just told her sure, as long as its not too short and my jaw dropped.

  
My mum seems to think there's absolutely no problem with letting her wear it but when I was 14 she would have NEVER let me wear a bikini. I tried to bring up to her that it was unfair that she was just letting my sister get whatever she wanted but she just got super angry with me and acted like I was being a brat. To be clear I have had the same pair of swimmers for 6 or 7 years and I'm buying the new pair with money I've made off doing quizzes and M has had all of her swimmers bought for her and she gets new pairs regularly (yearly), and was buying these new ones with her birthday money (she got quite a lot and I got none for my birthday). 

My sister had said she would just get her one piece because I made ""such a big issue over a little problem"" and has already ordered it, but is now saying the next time she gets money she's going to buy a bikini and not even wear her one piece. I was shocked so I told her she was spoiled and privileged because she had just gotten a new pair of swimmers but she just said that I was rude and dramatic. My mum is acting like I'm a brat for bringing it up and refuses to tell my sister no.

118,1fd803x,AITA for helping a fellow struggling college student?,"
Im a 20 year old woman who just transferred to university from two years of community college. Learning about the  various support systems in the school was enlightening and I felt glad to have them if I were to need them which I did, and had a positive experience with those who helped me through my struggles, leading me to always advise others to reach out if they were also struggling.
There was an 18 yr old freshman woman I had met during orientation week that I had chatted with a few times in between classes or at the dining hall. One day I saw her in the hall and waved to her, asking how's she's been. She seemed very tired and withdrawn, and quietly said she was so overwhelmed and wanted to give up. I sat with her while she shared all the struggles she had been having with her coursework and difficulty communicating with teachers. I asked what I could best provide in the moment to support, and she said she didn't care she just didn't want to be so stressed. I recommended her to the services I found aided me when I was struggling and even said l'd show her where to go and support her if needed. We went to the student advocate office and had a brief discussion with an associate (it was Friday evening and they had to head home for the weekend) and decided we would go back on Monday to discuss.
She asked for me to go with her that day and I agreed. Afterwards I shared my number and said I had a busy weekend in store but she could contact me if she needed someone.
The weekend was busy as I had anticipated, a in addition to the weeks workload, I was exhausted come Sunday. She texted me Sunday morning if i was going to get breakfast soon and I said honestly that I was going to stay in and tackle some chores afterwards. I saw her again on campus and asked if she was enjoying the weather, it was a beautiful day, and she nodded, turning away from me with no further comment.
Monday rolled around and I texted her in the morning if she'd still like me to accompany her for the meeting, receiving no response. l waited until closer to the time we were meeting to text again: no response. 10 minutes until our meeting I gave her a call: no response. I felt concerned so l asked a friend of hers if they had seen her around, and they checked her dorm to find she wasn't there. I went to the student support office to see if she had possibly wanted to meet there and the associate we had spoken with on Friday said they hadn't heard from her.
Two hours later she responded saying she was busy trying to ""figure out her situation"" and I find someone to talk to. Later that day I saw her again and asked how she was. She responded blankly with ""okay I guess"", and then when I asked
if she found support she said ""that's my personal information"". She seemed deeply offended and angry with me for asking, and I felt awful. Had I overstepped? Should I have contacted her more during the weekend? AITA?

I saw her again on campus and asked if she was enjoying the weather, it was a beautiful day, and she nodded, turning away from me with no further comment.
Monday rolled around and I texted her in the morning if she'd still like me to accompany her for the meeting, receiving no response. l waited until closer to the time we were meeting to text again: no response. 10 minutes until our meeting I gave her a call: no response. I felt concerned so l asked a friend of hers if they had seen her around, and they checked her dorm to find she wasn't there. I went to the student support office to see if she had possibly wanted to meet there and the associate we had spoken with on Friday said they hadn't heard from her.
Two hours later she responded saying she was busy trying to ""figure out her situation"" and I find someone to talk to. Later that day I saw her again and asked how she was. She responded blankly with ""okay I guess"", and then when I asked
if she found support she said ""that's my personal information"". She seemed deeply offended and angry with me for asking, and I felt awful. Had I overstepped? Should I have contacted her more during the weekend? AITA?

119,1fd7xvk,AITA for not being thrilled with my bfs little brother and best friend dating,"For context: I 22F have been dating my 23M boyfriend for almost two years. I’ve been in college for the past four years and am now finishing my last semester. My boyfriend and his 21-year-old brother haven’t been to college, which is a relevant background.

We met when he was living in my college city. We started dating quickly, but he had to move back home due to family reasons. We did long-distance for about a year and a half while he saved up to return. When he moved back, he brought his younger brother, who had never lived away from home before. My boyfriend helped his brother get a job at the same place he works. They moved into an apartment just ten minutes away from me, and everything seemed great.

For additional context: I used to be in a sorority. The best part was forming a close bond with my ""little,"" a younger sorority sister who became my best friend. In Greek life, sophomores pick freshmen to be their ""little"" to form a sisterly bond. My little and I hit it off immediately, sharing many interests and even living near each other in our hometowns. We became best friends, traveled together, and had many adventures, including a trip to Hawaii.

She met my boyfriend several times and liked him, but her attitude changed over time. She seemed annoyed when I included him in plans, such as my birthday trip, which I paid for entirely. Her behavior shifted as she started drinking and doing drugs more, and I noticed her mental health declining, though others saw it as normal partying.

On my 22nd birthday, I invited her, my boyfriend, and his brother to a pregame I was hosting. Though there were many people, she hesitated to come because she didn’t know many people but ended up attending. My boyfriend’s brother had a girlfriend at the time, though I hadn’t met her. That night, he ended up cheating on her with my little. I was distracted and didn’t see the flirting at first, but when I did, my friends and I warned her he had a girlfriend and shouldn’t proceed. Despite this, she spent the night with him, and they began dating shortly after.

Initially, I thought their relationship might bring us closer, and I defended her when others judged. However, things worsened when my boyfriend’s brother shared details of my relationship issues with her, which she then relayed to my friends. I dislike sharing my personal relationship issues with others, as I value privacy.

A month ago, we had a text conversation where she felt I hadn’t reached out enough and thought I was upset about their relationship. I had actually been concerned about preserving our friendship if either of us broke up.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Am I overreacting? Should I just let it go? It feels weird with her and him, and I even had to mute their posts on Instagram to avoid their constant updates

120,1fd7wws,AITA for buying my own phone after my dad read through all of my texts,"I (18f) am living with my parents (50s). I'm going off to college in two weeks.

I use my phone like most normal people my age would, if anything, a little less. For reference, my screen on my phone for the past few months is a 1 hour average. Social media, games, text. That might seem like a lot to some people but compared to my peers, it's relatively normal if not less than normal.

A week ago I found out that my dad read through my texts. All of them. I knew this because that morning I woke up to check my phone for an email I was supposed to get and the phone opened it to my text app and it was scrolled all the way down bottom. I knew that I didn't text anyone before going to bed so I immediately knew something was up. I confronted my dad about this (he has had a history of being invasive in the past) and he admitted to it right away. I was mad. I asked why. He said that he was concerned about me hanging out with the wrong people. I have literally done nothing, no behavior that would make him concerned. I have not hung out with anyone new except for my friends whom he's known for years. I have NEVER sent any texts or photos of explicit nature to anybody in my life. I have not had any behavioral incidents or big fights with friends, the last time something like that happened was in 6th grade. I am also not currently dating anyone. I really don't know why he would be so concerned about me that instead of talking with me, he just went straight to going through all my text conversations.

I was doing everything I could to not yell so I very passively aggressively asked why was he so concerned about me and told him he had no right to go through my texts. My dad got defensive too and said that he had every right to go through them because he paid for that phone. I said fine and just walked off.

I talked with my mom (she also dislikes my dad but that's a whole unrelated story) and she agreed to let me buy my own phone if I pay for the phone and a phone plan myself. I was like sure, no problem. I have $20k saved up from working a job during the past year and I had no problem spending $800 and a monthly fee if it meant that my dad couldn't use ""well I paid for it"" as an excuse to go through my phone again.

Yesterday my dad found out about the new phone and blew up on me. He said that as my parent he has the rights to check in on me whenever he felt concerned. I said that checking in on me is fine, going through my personal conversations was not. He called me a stupid f\*\*king r\*\*\*\*\*d and went on a rant about how he is my DAD, blah blah. I was tuning him out tbh. The last thing I said was that it's my money and I wanted to use it how I please.

Don't know if this is relevant but the phone I was using was old anyway. So I probably would have replaced it in a year if I didn't do it now.

I'm a 28-year-old woman, and I have sensory issues with sounds and touch, which have been heightened lately. I asked Missy not to make a specific sound while sending Snapchat messages because it's a sensory issue for me. I explained why it bothered me, recounting an experience from middle school to illustrate how certain sounds bother me. However, Missy interpreted it as me threatening to end our friendship over the sound.

I've stopped taking medication for medical reasons, and my anxiety and depression have worsened. I've been experiencing intense mood swings and have been avoiding social settings.

Missy threw a party for a friend, and although I initially declined, I ended up helping her clean and agreed last minute to attend. At the party, Missy, who was already tipsy, pulled me aside to tell me she had been telling my brother how mean I had been lately. Before we could continue, we were interrupted, sparing me from having this discussion in a highly anxious setting. After staying for a few hours, I announced that I was leaving. Missy insisted I come to the bathroom with her, where she confronted me with her grievances, while still tipsy. She accused me of being childish and ridiculous for considering ending our friendship over a silly sound. 

I tried to explain to Missy that's not at all what I was saying or implying, but she continued to talk over me and tell me how she couldn't be herself around me now that I'd brought this up and we eventually got to a point where I apologized for hurting her and that was not my intention she then asked to sit on my lap (she asked multiple times that night) and each time I declined as I did this time as well with very closed off body language. 
She then sits on my lap, shoving her face into my neck and giggling, and then makes THE sound in my ear. She apologized and stated it was an accident,  but at this point, I wanted to leave, so I said it was fine and left. 

This morning I felt uncomfortable with the situation and asked her for some time and to sit down and talk about this another day.

123,1fd7qin,"AITA for escalating a heated argument in front of kids, which had to be diffused by coaches?
","My son (in grade school) plays for a soccer team.

Today, at practice, a heated altercation happened between me and another parent. The other parent has a child on a younger team, but they were practicing with us today -- only important from the perspective that I won't see this parent around again.

I was practicing with my kid before practice began. We were using the fence as a goal (the goals weren't around today). We were there for 5-10 minutes before the mom showed up and stood by the fence where my son was shooting.

My first thought was ""well this is odd. why did she choose this place out of all places."" She also kept staring at me/us (I didn't much of it until after the incident) and looked annoyed. We kept practicing. My son kicked the ball in her direction a couple times, accidentally. Also, he's a very soft kicker and can't kick the ball hard.

One of the times, the dad came over and said asked the mom ""are you OK? did it hit you? did they say anything?"" At first, I thought ""wait. are they referring to my son's kick? no way. that was such a soft kick. maybe someone else kicked in her direction."" The dad started standing by the mom, and we kept practicing.

After 5 min, my son accidentally kicked in her direction again. Then dad said (idk if it was to me or my son) ""if this ball comes this way again, I'm going to kick it over the fence.""

I responded with ""for what? we've been practicing here before you showed up. go somewhere else."" He rambled some more and I said ""fuck off.""

He approached me physically until he was within a feet of me. He said ""you wanna fuck? you want all this smoke? you don't. you wanna go? let's go"" and I said ""dude. you've got 10-20 years on me, but you're acting like half my age. get the fuck out of my face""

That's when the coaches showed up and diffused the situation

I definitely played a part in escalating the situation, especially with kids around (not really within earshot of our heated incident though) but I'm sure they could've seen that we were verbally arguing about something.

Judge me based on the above, but I'll add these 2 extra details:

1. After the coaches diffused the situation, I walked away, and the dad was tried to apologize to me, and I just laughed and walked away and he started saying ""aww, keep crying""
2. This happened at the beginning of practice. At the end of practice, as we were walking away, he said ""hey man. have a good one"" in an apologetic tone. Again, I didn't acknowledge him, but my son overheard him telling other parents ""it's ok. some people are like that""

My brother is 15 and incredibly unhappy about the whole idea as it was sprung on us without much thought into our education or friends/family.",0.0,0.017329584807157516,0,1

We loved doing everything together and often matched outfits even just to stay at house, we just enjoyed doing everything.

I enjoyed pastels and many girly things while my sister enjoyed black and grunge styles which I always loved her style and very much admired it. She wasn’t very fond of mine but she still supported me as much as she could. When we were little we also made pretty much an oath that we would live together when we were of age to move out, and we were dead serious about it too we had our parents write out a contract and everything. When we were about to go to college we talked about it and we still wanted to follow through with our vow and rented a 2 bedroom apartment. Now the problem arises when it comes to the decor we chose. I bought most of the furniture and necessities due to the fact that I made a higher salary than her. I bought my decorations  and even bought her some because I knew that she didn’t have the money to decorate and I know she wouldn’t feel at home in a pastel dominated color pallet. Now fast forward about 5-6 months her boyfriend moves in and they seem genuinely happy together but after a few months of that arrangement I hear them arguing. Now this is where I may have been at fault because I’m very nosy but I don’t go around airing out peoples business though especially not my own sisters. But anyway I hear her boyfriend yelling at her about her throwing away my things, which I hadn’t known about until now. I wasn’t angry but I was pissed because I paid for it but also I might be overthinking it. But then I hear my sister say how she hated my aesthetic and it got on her nerves. Then I hear her talking about how I look like the type of girl that would’ve bullied her in high school.

I immediately got sick to my stomach and went to my room.

it seems that there was some miscommunication about the eviction. I’d like to clarify that I pay a vast majority of the bills with her chipping in only when she can which I’m fine with.

Later that night, his mom, dad, sister, sister’s longtime gf (sister and her gfs house) and I were all hanging out.

When talking about actual issues we both have faced. 

One point, I went into my designated room and just had a time of processing my own trauma. I was covering my ears and rocking telling myself it’s okay (I have DID and with the trauma I felt like I was a little girl waiting for the things to happen). My partner (from what I’ve learned in context) talked to his mom outside about the fact that even his own therapists think it’s unhealthy and unsafe to talk to either of his parents alone. 

She came into my room and knocked asking if she could come in and talk. I told her no, I didn’t feel safe, and I felt unsure if I could. I got to the point of her knocking and asking so many times in a row, I covered my ears and tried to tell her “please don’t come in, please leave”

But she came in, grabbed my wrist, and pulled my arm off of my head saying “you’re gonna listen to me” over and over again

129,1fd65do,AITA for having my partner stay over a lot?,"So, I’ve been living with a close friend of mine, Emma, for the past year and a half. Both of us are women in our early 20’s and rent a 2 bedroom flat. I’ve been friends with Emma since we were in middle school, and we haven’t had any issues living together until now. We’re both introverts, but enjoy each other’s company when we feel like hanging out.

At the beginning of July, I started dating a guy, Mac (male, also early 20’s). At first, Mac and I would only hang out a couple times a week, and Mac would usually sleep over my place. Mac lives with his family, so naturally we preferred my place over his.

However, we quickly fell head over heels for each other, and for the past month, maybe month and half or so, we’ve been seeing each other more often. Mac usually comes over Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and sometimes Sunday or Thursday as well. 

Whenever Mac is staying over, I  always give Emma a heads up. Emma knew I was really into Mac, and she seemed to be happy for me when we started dating. Also to note- we have separate bathrooms, so we only share a living room & kitchen. When Mac is over, we tend to stay in my room. The only time we take up common space is when we’re cooking (we do like to cook together). Emma never indicated having an issue about Mac being here. She has her own boyfriend of a year who has his own house, so she goes to him, mostly on the weekends.

Today, I got an angry text from Emma while I was at work. When Mac sleeps over, he always leaves with me when I go to work, but last night we got home super late after a concert, and he was sleeping when I got up to go to work. He had today off, so I let him sleep in, and then he couldn’t leave until someone was home, because I didn’t want to leave the front door unlocked (he doesn’t have a key). Emma got home a little earlier than usual, and thought she was alone until she saw Mac walking from my bathroom to my bedroom. 

Emma told me that she’s tried to be cool because she’s happy that I’m in a relationship, but she feels like Mac is always here. She’s also annoyed because I’ve never “formally introduced them,” and said it’s like she’s basically been living with a stranger for the past two months.

I feel bad that I made her feel that way. I didn’t mean to make her feel uncomfortable, and honestly thought that our arrangement was fine, since we’re mostly in my room when Mac is over, we’re quiet and respectful, and we don’t share a bathroom, so it’s not like Mac is hogging the bathroom/using up toilet paper. I’ll admit that I’ve never actually introduced Mac to Emma- he’s pretty shy, and I’ve kind of been waiting for the “perfect time.” 

Emma asked me how I’d like it if she had her boyfriend over 3-4 nights a week, and now I’m not so sure. I sort of get it, because I’m also an introvert who likes there space, but it’s not like Mac is here 5-7 nights a week.

I spent the weekend away at a different city to where we live and was originally due to arrive home on Sunday night. However, my gf had a death in the family recently, so we had arranged for me to meet at her parent's house instead. We would need to spend the night there as it was a few hours drive from our house. We both drove separately in our own cars for this reason.

After the funeral, we headed home in our own cars. My gf told me that if I got home first, I shouldn't go into the living room as she had a surprise for me.

When we both went into the living room together, I saw that she had changed the colour scheme of our living room. We had originally decorated it so that the main furniture was neutral, so that we could change the accessories in the future, if we changed our minds (like cushion covers etc). She had changed all the accessories and theme as a surprise.

I personally am not great with change, so I have some self awareness that I could be overreacting but need an outsiders opinion. I'm also hyper aware that we had just been to a funeral so emotions are high as well. 

I didn't react how she wanted to, in fact I was actually quite upset that she did this without talking to me first. She said that she paid for all the cushions etc out of her own money and not our joint account, so it shouldn't matter? I couldn't really discuss in detail why I was upset because I felt like I was being an ungrateful asshole and it really hurt to see her sad.

For a bit of context she is a typical crisis friend, and we’ve had a rough friendship. Since we’ve been friends, I’ve been in an on and off again relationship with my current boyfriend, and they’ve had their own type of friendship (my boyfriend is a die hard car enthusiast and she… well, claims to be.)

After 2 years my boyfriend and I broke up at the start of this year. We were both in bad places mentally, emotionally and financially and just snapped. We weren’t friends with her at the time, but shortly after we bumped into each other and started talking again. She told me she was still friends with him, but she understood I had feelings and as long as I was respectful, whatever was said between us would stay between us. I was a little hurt, but I knew he had very few friends and was in a really bad place and at the time I was just appreciative that he had someone who I thought would look out for him during a hard time.

The situation changed quickly tho and she started dropping details of what I was up to that would upset me and I started keeping my distance. A few weeks later me and him started talking and working through things. Bit by bit, truth starts coming out about what she’s been saying, things she’s been doing to try and keep us apart. He speaks to her first telling her he’s hurt by what she’s done and that it’s snakey. She says nothing but asks me what’s going on and so I text her saying I don’t understand why she’s done what she’s done and I just don’t know what to say to her. And she loses her mind at me. Telling me that she and him were good friends until I came back, that I was jealous and just a ballad of horrible things, and we haven’t spoken since.

For context: I’m 24F living with my dad and stepmom in California because rent is too high to move out. 

Last Monday, my car got keyed on the entire driver’s side, which really upset me. I was hopeful that my stepbrother, who lives in the same apartment complex, might have footage of the incident, but he couldn’t find any.

That day, I broke down crying when the police said it was felony-level damage and my insurance said I’d have to pay for the repairs out of pocket. I was crushed because I was sure we’d find the culprit on camera.

The next day, my dad got really angry because I had my boyfriend drive my car to keep it safe. (He lives 2 blocks away) He said I was giving the car away to my boyfriend and that I should just bring it back, even if it might get keyed again. We ended up in a huge argument where he said hurtful things, including expressing his disappointment in me. I was so angry that I threw a water bottle against the wall, which broke.

After cooling down, I decided to let go of the anger. I talked to my therapist about it and moved on, knowing my dad probably won’t apologize or feel remorse. However, today my stepmom told me that my dad was trying to help and that I was the one who overreacted. She implied that I’m to blame for making things worse and that my reaction was wrong.

I feel like I’m being gaslit. I don’t think I’m being biased; I know what I did wrong and have processed my feelings. I’m still keeping my car with my boyfriend until I get a dash cam. Should I feel bad for not bringing my car home?

so tonight, i show my dad a photo, and again she gets mad i don’t show her. so i got frustrated, having dealt with this at least 2 other times today. so i called her a narcissist, and told her that when she says stuff like that it annoys me.

she immediately got mad, starting to say how I’M also annoying, and picking out stupid things i do. (leaving clothes on my floor, not rinsing dishes before putting them in dishwasher, etc.)

her saying that stuff made me feel really upset, so i told her that and she ignored me. i just went on my phone while she kept saying how i don’t love her.

i feel really bad, and just wanted to know if i’m overreacting or being dramatic. it just feels like every time i tell her something she does that upsets me, she immediately says i don’t love her and that im ungrateful. AITA?

recently, she’s been acting what i would think is like a narcissist. if i show my dad a photo, she gets mad i don’t. if i text my dad, she gets mad i don’t text her. and she’ll say stuff like, “oh i get it; you just loveee your dad more than me. after all i do for you.” and stuff along those lines.

so tonight, i show my dad a photo, and again she gets mad i don’t show her. so i got frustrated, having dealt with this at least 2 other times today. so i called her a narcissist, and told her that when she says stuff like that it annoys me.

she immediately got mad, starting to say how I’M also annoying, and picking out stupid things i do. (leaving clothes on my floor, not rinsing dishes before putting them in dishwasher, etc.)

her saying that stuff made me feel really upset, so i told her that and she ignored me. i just went on my phone while she kept saying how i don’t love her.

i feel really bad, and just wanted to know if i’m overreacting or being dramatic. it just feels like every time i tell her something she does that upsets me, she immediately says i don’t love her and that im ungrateful. AITA?

134,1fd4sv3,AITA for hurting my mom’s feelings after moving out when she emotionally abused me for years?,"For context: I had shared custody between my parents and there were set days for when I was at one or the other’s house.

I lived at my mom’s house 50% of the time and I really hated it there. I would find every excuse to leave because I couldn’t stand it. She had daily and sometimes only weekly chores for me to do while she went to work. When she gets home and noticed that one thing wasn’t done correctly or I forgot to do one thing, she would FLIP OUT. I’m not talking scolding or asking me to do/re-do it, no i’m talking screaming and belittling me. 

I remember this one time in particular where she asked me to scoop the dog poop while she was at work, no big deal. I do it and go back up to my room. Hours later she comes home and asked if I did it, I say yes. She goes outside to check for herself and she sees I missed one small pile behind a bush. She starts yelling my name and I go downstairs to see why. She starts screaming at me and asking why I always do a half-ass job on my chores and never do it 100%. I defend my case and tell her that I seriously didn’t see the ONE pile behind the bush because it’s, well, behind a bush. I apologize and she won’t accept it. So I grab the shovel and get rid of it. I go back inside, (where she’s at now), and she’s just going on and on about me doing a “half-ass” job on my chores all the time and the house can never be clean because of me, etc. etc. etc. We’re sitting there going back and forth and she finally starts going upstairs to her room and I think it’s over, oh not yet. She proceeds to tell me she wishes she never had me because i’m the worst daughter ever and if one day she’s not “here” anymore then it’s my fault. That stuck with me, and it has for years. 

Ever since that day, I created a plan for my 18th birthday and how to move out. For a month, I start clearing out my room, slowly taking stuff to my dad’s. Then a couple days after my birthday, the next time I go to my dads, I text her, tell her I’m permanently living at my dads, and I hear nothing from her, no response. Now everyone blames me for her being depressed and saying that I hurt her so much for leaving. They were also the ones who supported and encouraged my decision to leave before I actually did it. 

So yeah, AITA? Let me know. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-10,"AITA for hurting my mom’s feelings after moving out when she emotionally abused me for years? For context: I had shared custody between my parents and there were set days for when I was at one or the other’s house.

136,1fd4pvp,AITA for being hurt because I stopped getting birthday gifts from my best friend?,"Two years ago I (20M) met my best friend (21F) in high school. On my 18th birthday she came to school and gave me a beautiful handmade gift. From now on it became our thing. We were making each other mostly handmade gifts because they didn't have to be perfect. I threw my birthday party month later when she gave me another gift that she created with the rest of our group(she really didn’t have to, she’s already gave me a great gift).

During Christmas she always organizes her birthday party, when our pack also do Secret Santa, so she always gets a gift from me.

Then the next year came and at uni she met her great friend (21F) and her current boyfriend (25M).

The next year I was celebrating my 19th birthday, but this time I was exhausted from my final exams and I didn’t want to throw a party. Also my dad is now sick and can’t really walk and I also have two little sisters so I couldn’t tell them all to leave for one night so that my friends could come and drink.

But I thought I’d get more gifts than just one from only my family. On my birthday my best friend sent me funny wishes and I thought she’d give me a gift when we’d meet in the city. But it didn’t happen.

Like I said it wasn’t about getting sth particular or expensive. I wanted absolutely everything just because it was our tradition and I loved it.

I’ve waited a month, two, then I asked about it. I saw she felt bad but she said it was because I didn’t throw up a party that year. Bad excuse because year ago she gave me one even month before party.

After New Years Eve her boyfriend had birthday and she was discussing so many details about his present with me, how to paint sth, decorate etc. (she was a little bit clueless and I'm studying art). His gift had three major parts, so she’s spent a lot of time doing it.

And I know that gifts for bf/gf are very special so I knew I couldn’t be mad about it but this year I again didn't get anything. Also this time didn't mention anything because I was just sad.

But then, a little bit later she consulted me about a painting she was doing for her uni friend I’ve met. And I thought: Hold up, I didn’t get anything for the past two years but you will start a very meaningful painting for her even two months before her actual birthday?

  


I don’t know what to think about it.

AITA here?

I don’t know if it’s because we’re such a long time best friends and we both know we’re not coming anywhere so she stopped trying?

And will I get my birthday present only when I organize my own party?
