0,1fdlzl9,AITA for telling my best friend to call off her wedding? UPDATE,"OG: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f10dlw/aita\_for\_telling\_my\_best\_friend\_she\_should\_call/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f10dlw/aita_for_telling_my_best_friend_she_should_call/)

Hi everyone. Everything exploded after I made this post so I thought I would update.

A few days after Daisy cut me off she showed up on my doorstep, bag in hand, completely distraught. She came inside, and some hugging and crying, calmed down enough to tell me that Max had found out, they'd gotten in a massive argument, and Max went to his brother's for the night.Â 

Apparently, one of Daisy's friends who was at the party, Georgia (24F), told her boyfriend Greg (27M), one of Max's groomsmen who then called Max and told him everything - how Daisy had hidden the pregnancy, she'd told everyone else at the party,and how she was going to surprise him AFTER the wedding. Max was pissed at her, saying they weren't in a financially good place since they'd just spent a lot of money on the wedding and the honeymoon, he couldn't believe she didn't tell him but she told everyone else. He felt betrayed and said he 'didn't even recognise' her. Daisy was a mess, even saying she should've listened to me. 

She stayed at my place over the next few days while Max got his space. During that time she had about a dozen missed calls and texts from friends and family; guess word spread fast. She mostly slept and tried to distract herself. After about a week Max called her saying he wanted to talk, so she went back to their place. Long story short, Max called off the wedding for now. Apparently he said he wasn't comfortable enough in the relationship to get married as planned because it was a massive breach of trust, and that he'd rather postpone and work things out. As of now whether they'll get married in the future is up in the air. They're still together and are having conversations about the pregnancy and having children. Daisy hasn't told me much more than that; she sort of dropped off the face of the Earth for most of us since this happened. I think she's focusing on Max. Our friendship is fine, but definitely not the same. I still wish Daisy the best after everything, and for those of you interested, I still stand by my decision.Â 

After reading everyone's comments and thinking a lot about what happened, I don't regret communicating to her how I felt. Maybe telling her to call it all off was a bit much, I can admit that, but I'm still glad I said something. Also, to everyone saying I want to sleep with Max: I'm a lesbian, but that was a cute hypothesis. ",UPDATE,2024-09-10,"AITA for telling my best friend to call off her wedding?

1,1fdi8q9,AITA for telling my Dad I donâ€™t care if heâ€™s absent at my wedding?,"For some backstory:
I (F24) have a rough relationship with my dadâ€™s (M43) wife, E (F41). They got together in 2006, married in 2011, and have had two children since then. 

E has never liked me. I was introduced to her when I was 7 and things were instantly sour. She was mean, snarky and had no interest in me whatsoever. Now, as an adult, I can tolerate her behaviour (which has gotten significantly worse as Iâ€™ve grown up and began to talk back). The issue lies with the fact that my dad has always allowed it. Iâ€™m a grown woman and can handle myself now, as Iâ€™ve been doing for years, but when I was a child, he had nothing to say about her borderline abusive behaviour and will find ways to change the subject/excuse it whenever itâ€™s brought up. This has significantly damaged our relationship, and weâ€™re low-contact as of now.

So, Iâ€™m getting married in November this year to J (M25). Weâ€™ve been together for 11 years. E is insistent that she will be there. She will not. I have made this clear since we got engaged in November 2023. My dad is invited, but I made it plainly clear last year that she wasnâ€™t welcome as a result of her behaviour, attitude, and treatment of the both of us.

*Itâ€™s worth mentioning here that J also doesnâ€™t want E present as she is discriminatory - J is trans (FTM) and E will deadname him, make comments about it all, and is overall hateful. He is also defensive of me given that he has been with me for the majority of Eâ€™s treatment.

So; my dad met with me last week and told me that if E wasnâ€™t present at my wedding, he wouldnâ€™t be either. I honestly expected something like this to happen, so I said that it was fine. He was confused and asked me to elaborate, so I explained that he didnâ€™t have to attend, but it meant that I would never speak to him again, that I had dealt with him choosing E over me for almost 20 years and that my wedding (of his first and only daughter) being a subject of debate was the final straw. He said nothing for a moment afterwards and then got up and left. E has been blowing up my phone with explicit texts but itâ€™s been radio silence from my Dad since our chat. 

As I said - Iâ€™ve dealt with Eâ€™s treatment, and by extension, my dadâ€™s silence for almost two decades. My wedding feels like a good place to finally end this all, to start over. I donâ€™t see a way to fix this, or our relationship, as long as heâ€™s with E.

2,1fd8t6z,AITA (19F) for using my parents health insurance when I didn't have any other choice?,"Ok so to preface this with a few details I have just moved out a month ago from what is basically a collage dorm off campus in state in Utah and my parent are very mormon.

About two years ago I fully came to the realization that I was transgender (MTF) and started going to therapy for it and was paying fully privately out of my own pocket. About a year ago. when I was originally going to come out to my family and was still living at home, my mother had cleaned my room and found my bra. When I got home we sat down and talked and she said that what I was going through was just as phase and that I was ""god child"" and that ""god doesn't make mistakes."" I was lucky that she didn't tell my dad at the time as he is a very big Republican and conspiracy theorist, like when I brought up that Alex Jones was on trial for what he said about Sandy Hook he said,""I can see how that could be."" I went back into the closet for about another month until, through therapy I was able to come back out of the closet but at that time my family was a lot more open with their political views and what they thought about trans people.

Half way through this year I decided that I was going to move out and start HRT. After searching for a while I was able to find a doctor that was near by that specialized in gender affirming care and scheduled an appointment. When I went there I didn't know what the price would be until I got there and my card got declined. I asked to know how much the appointment was and it was about $500. Was worried that I got all this way for nothing and decided to use my parents insurance which I am currently under. It was through my Moms work and it would just be seen as Hormone Affirming Therapy and not as transgender care so I thought she wouldn't know. There was still a copay of about $250 dollars that I paid out of pocket and it was the same for the medicine that I had prescribed. Since then I had been dreading that my parents would find out and today they did.

Today when I was in class I got a text from my mom asking if I was seeing a new doctor and if I was seeing them for hormone affirming care. At this point I knew I was screwed and, after my girlfriend came over for emotional support (she only heard my side of the conversation), I called my mom. I told her the truth and hoped for the best but sadly it was the opposite. She told me that she loved me and I would always be her son but that if I was going to continue on this route she would not support me and I would have to either pay for my own insurance or she would kick me off of the family's. I feel bad for using her insurance but with the uncertanty of whether or not I would be able to get it in the future made me scared so I used it.
