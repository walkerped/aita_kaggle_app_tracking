1,1fenkf0,AITAH for wanting one thing.,"Hello Reddit it's my first time posting so, be gentle. 

I (f30) and my boyfriend Jordan (m30 fake name) have been together for a few years now.  We live together, sleep together, and have already made tentative plans about our wedding. We share just about everything from dreams, ambitions, and childhood trauma.

Recently, I got home before Jordan and decided to watch one of the movies from my childhood that I consider a guilty pleasure. It's a dumb movie that I'm a little embarrassed about, but it's not inappropriate or anything like that. I get the urge to watch this movie once every couple years.

During my streaming on my phone, Jordan called.  I jokingly (and apparently stupidly) said that he was interrupting my movie. When he asked me what I was watching I got a little defensive and said I'd rather not say. Partially from being embarrassed and partially because.... I don't know why.

Que the 45 minute conversation about how we tell each other everything and it's silly for me not to tell him and I'm making a big deal out of nothing ect.. and me basically saying I'm a little embarrassed don't want to tell him and is so bad that this is one thing I don't want to share. Especially considering we have the rest of our lives to share everything else. 

Then came the pouting. He has a history of pouting and it absolutely infuriates me. A grown 30 year old man pouting like a child really pisses me off (I have an inkling that it has to do with him being an only child no offense to any of those reading)

Now, it's become such a big deal that I don't want to tell him purely out of principal. I feel like having this one single thing I don't share with him is not too big of an ask. And now we've escalated to him thinking that this spat is dumb because it's not even that big of a deal and I should just relent and tell him. 

So I just need to know, am I the a-hole for this?

I take care of a 9 year old boy and sometimes his friend (mind you I have never been paid his friend mom). A month ago the friend’s mom Sandra (45F & fake name) asked for my number. I thought nothing of it since I assumed she wanted to have my number just in case she needed to contact me since I do watch her kid sometimes during play dates.This afternoon I get a snap notification saying that Sandra added me.

She is saying Sandra may want to be flirt with me but I told her I don’t think so cause typically Sandra is professionally nice to me.

This is causing friction because my boyfriend has an habit of leaving food out at room temperature for a long time, here's some examples that I refused to eat:

* Rice left out at room temperature for 4 hours
* Vegetable soup left at room temperature overnight, but covered (he says no bacteria would get in, cover wasn't removed since it was boiling)
* Some sort of spongecake that had been left on the counter (covered) for two weeks
* Vegan spaghetti sauce in the fridge after two weeks

4,1feml0w,AITA my parents pressuring me into a career I don't like.,"I (22F) recently graduated university (BSc Medical science) and am aiming to go into the medical field. My plan is to work an entry level NHS Job to gain clinical experience and then apply for MSc Clinical Science in 2025 or 2026 w/ the NHS. 

Last week I found out that I'd been successful in landing one of these jobs, and I was super excited, because it is the perfect stepping stone to help me get to where I want to be. However it is around 5 hours away from where I currently live, meaning I will have to relocate. (Job is in Newcastle, I am in Cambridge)

I haven't told my family about this yet as I know they will not be supportive. 

My home situation is very relevant:
I still live at home with my parents, (Dad = electrician, Mom = social worker), my twin and my  younger brothers (11y & 9y). 
I grew up very sheltered, very obedient. Up to this point, I have almost always followed my parents direction, even if it was something I was absolutely against doing.

My parents do not agree with my career plans. I have laid out their plans 'life plan' for me below to make things a bit clearer.

PARENTS PLAN: They wanted me to apply for a MSc Physician Associate degree straight out of uni, with the view that I would finish in two years and begin work. Following this, I am supposed to aid our family in buying a new house and continue to live at home until I get married.

I want none of these things. 

I have upset my parents because I didn't apply for the Physician Associate MSc. And they are totally against the Master's that I would eventually like to pursue. 

Below is a conversation I had with my dad a few days ago:

CONVERSATION: My dad expressed his disappointment in me and my actions. He believes that the interviews I've been attending are too far away, and it would be selfish of me to accept a job offer and move out when I should stay, to help with household bills and take care of my younger brothers. He pointed out that alot of our family's friends have bought new houses, and that we should be able to do the same.

So for the next year, he wants me to continue in my current job to help with bills, (I am working part-time in a warehouse, and pay for electric and water utilities). Then when the Physician Associate MSc programme opens up again in Feb,  he wants me to apply for the September 2025 intake.

During this conversation, I couldn't speak and just cried. I couldn't tell him about my job offer, or the things that I would like to do with my life, because I felt, and do still feel so incredibly guilty. But also angry, because this just IS NOT what I want. 

I know if I don't accept this job opportunity, and instead do as my parents want I will forever be struggling with 'what-if?'. But I also feel as though I owe it to my dad to try and support him and my younger siblings as much as I can, especially now that my dad's health is not great. I have layers and layers of guilt and frustration that I don't know how to deal with.  

Due to all the guilt I feel,  I'm unable to have an adult conversation with my parents without bursting into tears. Which makes me look like a child😅. This is another big part of my issue. I don't even know how to have the conversation.

So I would like to know, am I the asshole? 

EDIT_ PLEASE READ: 
It's worth noting that a lot of my guilt lies in the fact that my dad is not very well right now, due to sciatica and diabetes. But he is continuing to provide financially for the whole family despite this. I feel as though me leaving and letting him continue to do this alone, would indeed make me an awful person.

after that situation of two months ago i just felt something switch in me, i started to lowkey fear her, and i just felt resentment building up. she is the type of person that likes to be on facetime 24/7, and i was okay with it at first but now i started to feel so suffocated, its always about the same problems, the same people, same boys, when i talk i always get a small reaction then the conversation shifts to her, and when i tell her good news about me i get an “mm” and that just throws off my whole mood, like you see me jumping around and you cant pretend to be happy for me??

7,1fel6jy,AITAH For telling my brother to find another place to live because he can’t sleep,"AITAH For getting frustrated at my brother.

I (24F) have two kids (4f) and (11Month old Male) and a niece (12f) that belongs to my sister. So for context my brother (30M) Andrew DOESNT WORK (fake name) lives with me before he joins the army. He’s lived with me since June of last year but recently we’ve had a problem. I adopted two dogs husky that we discovered Andrew is allergic to and Andrew doesn’t want the dogs in the living room (where he sleeps at night) because his nose gets messed up and he’s up sneezing so I keep the dogs in my room and let them roam around and take them outside when they need to use the bathroom and to walk them. 




He tells me to keep them in the cage so they don’t mess up my carpet anymore than they can but I don’t agree with that because it is my house but I also don’t want my brother to suffer. So they sleep in my room but we spend time mostly outside. Here’s where we have the problem. My brother claims even if he goes to sleep at 2am that he can wake up around 8am-9am. I have three kids I take care of while my husband is deployed. My son wakes up around 7am and my daughter around 8-8:30am. Lately I’ve been sleeping on my other couch because my bed frame broke and my dogs bit up my mattress. I have my new mattress but I’m waiting on my bed frame to arrive. 





For months since around MAY,  my kids wake up my brother early around 6am ( I am in the navy so I have to wake up early get dressed in uniform and take my kids to daycare to go to work and drop my niece off at school) they cry because it’s early and that wakes up my brother who sleeps on the couch. Now that my son had surgery nothing major a circumcision I have been home since AUG26. Like I stated my son sleeps on the couch with me because he’s a co sleeper and my daughter sleeps upstairs. My body wakes up before my son around 7am and I take him to the kitchen to make breakfast and give him a bottle. My brother sleeps at 2-3am and then complains when he’s awoken multiple times in the morning from around 8am-10am. 




He wants me to put my good mattress on the bedroom floor and sleep up there. I did that but whenever my kids come downstairs to eat they are loud and I don’t tell them to shush because they’re kids they will cry and make noise and laugh and etc. now my brother is mad at me because he keeps getting woken up despite everything. 





He doesn’t work either, he stopped cleaning when I was diagnosed with post partum depression and I stopped cleaning and cooking because of my mental health. So he took a “break” I now started cooking cleaning and baking again since they gave me medication and I started therapy and I even make my brother coffee, food, and bake.  When he wakes up goes on his phone or play the game. That’s all he does all day is be on his phone or the PS4. And then gets mad when my son cries for me to pick him up or because he sleepy and then he says “I’m agitated because I’m tired and keep getting woken up between 8-10am).

He tells me to keep them in the cage so they don’t mess up my carpet anymore than they can but I don’t agree with that because it is my house but I also don’t want my brother to suffer. So they sleep in my room but we spend time mostly outside. Here’s where we have the problem. My brother claims even if he goes to sleep at 2am that he can wake up around 8am-9am. I have three kids I take care of while my husband is deployed. My son wakes up around 7am and my daughter around 8-8:30am. Lately I’ve been sleeping on my other couch because my bed frame broke and my dogs bit up my mattress. I have my new mattress but I’m waiting on my bed frame to arrive. 





For months since around MAY,  my kids wake up my brother early around 6am ( I am in the navy so I have to wake up early get dressed in uniform and take my kids to daycare to go to work and drop my niece off at school) they cry because it’s early and that wakes up my brother who sleeps on the couch. Now that my son had surgery nothing major a circumcision I have been home since AUG26. Like I stated my son sleeps on the couch with me because he’s a co sleeper and my daughter sleeps upstairs. My body wakes up before my son around 7am and I take him to the kitchen to make breakfast and give him a bottle. My brother sleeps at 2-3am and then complains when he’s awoken multiple times in the morning from around 8am-10am. 




He wants me to put my good mattress on the bedroom floor and sleep up there. I did that but whenever my kids come downstairs to eat they are loud and I don’t tell them to shush because they’re kids they will cry and make noise and laugh and etc. now my brother is mad at me because he keeps getting woken up despite everything. 





He doesn’t work either, he stopped cleaning when I was diagnosed with post partum depression and I stopped cleaning and cooking because of my mental health. So he took a “break” I now started cooking cleaning and baking again since they gave me medication and I started therapy and I even make my brother coffee, food, and bake.  When he wakes up goes on his phone or play the game. That’s all he does all day is be on his phone or the PS4. And then gets mad when my son cries for me to pick him up or because he sleepy and then he says “I’m agitated because I’m tired and keep getting woken up between 8-10am). AITAH because I told him I can’t shut my kids up and if there’s a problem he needs to go live somewhere else because I do not care anymore",,0.028425675,0,0
8,1fekz0r,AITA for picking up my cat from my grandparents place earlier?,"
I (26f) came back town from UK to visit my family for a week. My mother has a cat which she adopted from my sister many years ago. For those years I also took care of her as I lived in the same household and considered her my cat as well.

 While my mother was on holiday last month, she dropped the cat off at my grandparents place to cat sit for 3-4 weeks. The cat is quite old and is getting frailer, and in honesty my grandparents did take care of her lovingly and made sure she ate. Few days ago I came back town and made arrangements to pick up my cat few days before my mother comes back. I asked my mother if she agrees and contacted my grandparents that I wanted to come visit and get my cat. I brought the cat carrier, got a direct train ticket and bought a seat just for the cat as well. In total the trip with my cat would have taked 2 hours maximum.

Immediately my grandfather (68m) objected and raised all issues why I can't pick up the cat. He became so adamant that I cannot get her earlier, naming all sort of reasons from the weather to fear of stressing out the cat. I explained to him that I dealt with cats all my life and have done travelling with animals numerous times. She is my cat and she's supposed to be home soon anyway. He knows how important this was to me yet absolutely refused, would not even hear me. I raised the point that I wanted to see her for the last few days, as my cat is old and I'm not sure how long she'll live. I work in the UK so this might be my last time seeing her. He would not listen and blame me for being away and not being able to see her. As I did not want to upset my grandmother and just ""kidnap"" my cat, I left after the visit without my cat. As I went to the train station I broke down crying, frustrated and very aware that that might be the last time I'll see my cat. My mother agreed to the early pick-up and I couldn't see any reason why he would refuse other than his own selfishness and the fact that he never respected my views as I am the ""kid"" in the family. I'm not sure if I'm overreacting, but every time I think it I so upset. Am I the A-hole?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for picking up my cat from my grandparents place earlier?

10,1fekvax,AITA for not wearing slippers in my own home?,"I (33F) bought a house with my husband (34M) in May of this year. It is a townhome on the edge of our city, and we have neighbors on one side, but the house on the other side is currently empty.

Our next door neighbors seem nice enough, but we have only ever talked to them either when we are picking up packages or when they come to complain about noise. For context, the first weekend we had the house we decided to have some friends over to build furniture on a Sunday, and then tried again the next week (again on Sunday). As we were building things, one of our neighbors came over to ask us not to do construction on Sunday because of the legal quiet hours. (This is not true, as we were building inside of our house, which is allowed on your own property on Sundays where we live.) I was annoyed, but we decided that we would accommodate them and bake them cookies as an apology.

Things seemed to be ok after that. And then my husband was breaking ice cubes from the trays on a Sunday a couple months later and banged it all of 3-4 times on the countertop. Next thing I know, our neighbor has run over and is demanding we not build.

I didn’t say anything but was annoyed because since it wasn’t even a minute before he came over. Not wanting to fight, we have put up soundproofing in our living room in case our tv is loud and generally avoid making sound on Sundays now. It feels a bit like we are walking on eggshells in our own home.

Then, the other day, I was up trying to get to sleep around midnight and their TV was blasting so loud that we could hear it in our bedroom. I’ve heard their tv and music through the walls before, but generally brush it off since it was during the day. This time, it was genuinely too late to be reasonable and was actually breaking the law regarding quiet hours. I talked with my husband and we chose wait to say anything until we saw them in passing.

Today, my husband picked up some packages from their place and mentioned the noise from the other night. He was told by our neighbor that the walls between our houses were very thin and they actually are even annoyed by us walking around in our own home. Their recommended solution was that we should wear slippers all the time.

My husband thinks this is a good solution, but he wears house slippers all the time so it’s not a big change for him. I, personally, don’t like wearing house slippers (and in my experience, these do very little to stop the sound of footsteps anyway) and am hesitant to do so just to accommodate something that is a normal part of living so close to people.

Sam and kim gets off earlier than me and May (we get off at 6:30, technically can get off earlier if all the kids leave). We planned the dinner last Friday at 7:30. Me and my sister close to the place, while both Sam and May live far but agreed to the time and said to make the reservation. 
      
The place we wanted to go to has a policy that they will not sit you until your whole party is present so if they aren’t you could end up missing your table and having to wait 30 to an hour for another one. 
       
Fast forward a couple days to Friday. Kim and Sam have already left and there was only 3 other teachers: me, May and another coworker. May only had 2 kids left one was my nephew and the other was another child. It was about 5:50. I told May multiple times to give me her students so she could leave and get ready which she gave me the other child but not my nephew saying he doesn’t want to go with me. When the all kids left except for my nephew and niece, I clocked out and got into my car and May clocked out and for in hers. It was not 6:40. I leave the parking lot first and May is still in her car texting. 

     I get home and get showers and changed and me Kim, my niece and nephew head over to the place and Sam is already there. We now are waiting for May. It’s gets to 7:10 and she’s not there.

After the 10 minutes, I said that we should just eat without her and we messaged her we were gonna eat. she showed later in the dinner her and her son sat down at another table. 

   After we paid we went into the lobby and she got up to leave without paying. She then starts to send messages in the group chat about how we don’t care about her and how she and her son was hungry too and that she would never do something like this to us. I replied saying that my niece and nephew was also hungry and starting to get restless waiting and that she knew the reservation time and she stayed longer at work when she knew she had somewhere to be.

12,1fekcd2,AITA for not trusting my brother to babysit?,"I (21F) am a new mother to a 6 month old baby boy. The father is currently not in the picture so I’ve been relying a lot on the support of my family to help me with the baby since I am working to provide for both of us. Usually during weekdays both my mother (43F) and father (50M) take care of the baby while I work during the day and I pick him up from my parents house once I get off of work. 

My little brother (18M) is currently living with our parents and sometimes helps out with his nephew but has never been left alone with him. Though I do need help from my family I try not to bother my brother too much about the baby since he is still pretty young. 

Last weekend I was called into work for an extra shift. I usually don’t work on weekends but I was willing to do it for the extra pay. I called my parents to ask if they were busy for the night and to ask them if they would watch the baby for me. My father told me to bring the baby over so I could take the extra shift.

When I finished my shift I headed back to my parents house to go pick up the baby and when I got there I heard my baby excessively crying before I even got to the door. I never heard my baby cry like that before. Instead of knocking like I usually do, I used a spare key that my mother gave me to open the door. When I got into the living room I saw my baby in his playpen crying with no one in the room with him. I picked him up and noticed that his diaper hadn’t been changed. I was confused since my parents never left the baby alone before and definitely not in the condition he was in. I called my parents to see where they were and my mother explained to me that her and my father went out on a date night and my brother volunteered to watch the baby. 

My brother had never been left alone with the baby and I was upset with my parents for leaving my brother alone with my baby knowing that he didn’t have a lot of experience taking care of babies. I ended up cleaning my baby and telling my parents that they should never leave my baby with my brother again without telling me. My brother walked in while I was on the phone with my parents and apologized explaining that my parents also wanted him to laundry which is why the baby was left alone. 

I do regret it but I yelled at my brother explaining that it was never a good idea to leave a baby alone especially if you hear the baby screaming and crying. I told him I would never trust him alone with my child and left the house.

She told me about going back to her ex boyfriend who already claimed to have a relationship going but she won’t believe him, also it is known that they have no chance for a future together later due to her being in a strict catholic and he in a strict muslim family. They had an very close and emotional relationship with each other so she still hasn’t forgotten about him even tho her already having relationships with other dudes. 
She also claimed that they both weren’t a hundred percent faithful in their relationship so after she broke up with him it would kind of be a new beginning in things like realistic relationships. Tbh i was relieved that she broke up back then because it is clearly like a moth wanting to fly into fire and her family would abandon her for her if she ever marries him and convers to islam. Btw he was also texting me for a month or two before they got serious back then (that was before we got friends) and showed interest but i instantly let him down and deleted him from my snap and insta after knowing that the girl of the same religion of me (catholic) had also a talking stage going with him. Back then i told her about the situationship and its end, also like how it didn’t affect me because it wouldn’t be worth it to want him (im from a very strict religious household) and so making her to my rival or whatever. So a good friendship began after that with a lot of memories, i had my first cigarette and vape with her, we cried and laughed together.

Ofc my facial expressions told on me and i didnt reacted the way she wanted so she got mad and hurt. She told me ongoing how i should support her as a good friend in everything she does and how the relationship between them has nothing to do with me anyways.

She told me that if i use my affection as an argument she doesn’t want it anymore. Girl i didnt use it as an argument it was an fact and i never told her that she mustn’t get back to him just how it would be better if she didn’t🙄.
She told me that i should stop care if that’s the case and my feelings wouldn’t change any of her decisions anyways, that we should separate our ways.

Girl i didnt use it as an argument it was an fact and i never told her that she mustn’t get back to him just how it would be better if she didn’t🙄.
She told me that i should stop care if that’s the case and my feelings wouldn’t change any of her decisions anyways, that we should separate our ways. 
Sorry if my english wasn’t that good, i hope that you still understood the point in my text so:

14,1fejriw,AITA for contacting safety and causing a whole conundrum at work? ,"I (f, 28) work for a very large water company that is insane about maintaining safety standards. Recently, I managed to develop tendonitis and stress fractures in my foot, and have to wear a walking boot for a couple weeks. My job is mostly field work, but I can do office and plant work during down time. 

Here's where I might be the asshole. My boss doesn't like me. She's made this abundantly clear many times. She told me that it was a-okay to come to work in the walking boot (campus requirement is steel/composite toe due to machinery and chemicals in use), just not to go into the labs or pump buildings. I contacted our safety team to verify what she'd said as it seemed very against company policy (it was), and now safety is getting HR and the ADA involved. 

My boss and coworker are being really shitty with me because they are going to have to pick up my slack, plus my boss is dealing with HR drilling her. They both are giving me snide looks, making snarky comments about ""not pulling my weight"" and just being dicks in general. I literally just wanted to verify to make sure I wouldn't get in trouble for being physically at the plant, not cause this whole shitshow. 

Safety wants me to work remotely. HR hasn't weighed in yet, but it's been stated their opinion is to either work remotely OR my boss has to give up her office (it's the only first-floor office) so I can work. My boss is refusing to let me work remotely as she can't concentrate when she works remotely, and can't stay on track, so she doesnt trust others to do so. She also hasn't given up her office, so Im forced to walk up and down stairs on broken toes any time I need to use the restroom, heat up lunch,  use the printer, etc. My foot is absolutely killing me right now, at the end of the first day.

The pain isn't the worst of it. The AC isn't working in our building, and the building was constructed in like 1880, so it heats up horribly. Even with windows open, if the outside temperature gets above 80°F, my office is sweltering. My boss bought portable AC units for every other part of the building except my office when the AC went out originally, claiming I didn't need it since I worked out in the field 90% of the time.  

But, all this to ask, am I the asshole for going behind my bosses back and contacting safety when I didn't believe her, which inadvertently caused a massive shitstorm at work? 

Update: HR & Safety are forcing her to allow me to work from the plant/remote for at least 2 weeks, and have since stated that if she isn't willing to at least share her office, she will have to swap offices with me for the time being. I'll likely be going into the plant to keep her from saying I wasn't productive enough or anything of the sort. HR is NOT pleased with how she's behaved. They've made that abundantly clear. This isn't the first time she's pulled something like this, and this isn't the first time HR has been notified of her treating me poorly. A couple people have lodged complaints at various times due to her singling out those she doesn't particularly like. 

Side note:  I've worked on broken toes before  (at a different job) and didn't need any accommodations. This time around, the tendonitis is wreaking havoc. It's worse than the actual broken bones. That isn't going to go away unless I can take it easy. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for contacting safety and causing a whole conundrum at work?

16,1fej565,AITA for Uninviting My Brother from My Wedding,"I (29F) am getting married in a few months, and I’ve been working hard to make it a special day for everyone involved. My brother (31M) has always been very active in local politics, which has led to some heated family debates. He’s currently running for a local office, and while I support his ambitions, his constant political talk has been a source of tension in our family.

Last week, during my bridal shower, my brother took it upon himself to make a surprise announcement. In the middle of the event, he gave an impromptu speech about his political campaign, complete with campaign slogans and a request for donations. The atmosphere immediately shifted from celebratory to uncomfortable. Guests were visibly confused and annoyed, and some even left early.

After the event, I told my brother that his stunt was inappropriate and that I couldn’t have him turning my wedding into a political platform. I explained that I wanted the day to be about love and celebration, not political agendas. I asked him to either keep politics out of the wedding or to not attend.

My brother is furious, claiming that I’m trying to “suppress his voice” and that I’m being unreasonable. Our parents are also upset, saying that I’m being unfair and should accommodate his campaign because it’s important to him.

I’m feeling conflicted because I don’t want to create a rift in the family, but I also don’t want my wedding to become a political event.

There was this fake ketchup bottle I bought at the dollar store that has this red string attached to it so it looks like real ketchup but it's actually empty. So we bought chinese food and as we opened up the boxes (we were planning to share them) I said ""hey it's better if we add ketchup to it"" and I took out the bottle and ""squeezed"" it onto the food. (you can look it up to see what I mean) And obviously it's a prank so nothing was added to the food or even made contact with any of it (I was careful ofc).

My mom and sister were both ""NO what are you doing"" and screamed but then right after when they realized what was going on my mom laughed and she found it hilarious. But my sister didn't and she said F off etc, and she also got angry at my mom for taking my side in that it was just a quick harmless joke.

I don't get it... they both saw what happened, I purposely aimed from higher & at an upwards angle so the string wouldn't make contact with the food so nothing got contaminated... My mom got it, she found it hilariuos but the sister didn't. It's not like she's always a negative nancy, she's normal with this so this was just kinda weird.

19,1fei8j4,WIBTA if I stopped sharing custody of the dog?,"I think my ex is using my dog to manipulate and control me. It is the last thing that is keeping us tied together. Is it selfish of me to stop “sharing custody” of MY dog with him.
My ex and I got together five years ago and he never wanted a dog. He would always say we’re too busy and we don’t have time or I don’t want the responsibility I want to he able to come and go as I please and not have to worry about a dog. Which is fine. So after two years of being together we split. He thought the grass would be greener on the other side. He realized he was wrong. We were split for about a year and a half and within that time is when I got Rue. He was ten week when I drove to Michigan from New York to pick him up. Rue was ten months when we got back together and just turned two in August.
I am not saying that he didn’t fall head over heels for Rue within that year because he absolutely did. But at the end of the day it was clear to everyone and anyone he was my dog. He is my soulmate through and through and the closest thing I have to a child since I have no human children. When we split I was unsure how Rue was going to handle moving to a new place and not having my ex around because he’s the only other person other than myself who’s been a constant person in his life, so I agreed with a strict boundary that we are on Rue speaking terms only. He has a tendency to drunk me telling me he loves me and then hates me. 
I work from home for an insurance company so when Rue is with me we are outside playing, hiking, swimming, doing all the things 24/7. He goes everywhere with me it is extremely rare that I leave him home alone. My ex owns his own auto repair shop and lives in the same building as his shop and leaves him for eight to ten hours a day to bar hop with his friends or work on extra curricular projects or whatever he does is really not my business, but why ask to see the dog just to leave him home alone. 
So the other day I decided to go see some friends out of town for the first time since we split. I dropped him off on Friday after dinner, and left Saturday late morning got to my destination around lunchtime. No sooner had I gotten onto my destination he calls me and tell me the dog was sick, eating grass and hacking not puking white phlen and has been sleeping on the couch all day. He asked if I could watch Rue for a few hours because he had an errand to run. I asked him what time he had to leave for his errand and he said 330 which he called me at 1. I told him I would call him back. 
**side notes** It is not abnormal for Rue to eat grass or hack up phlegm. We went hiking the day before so he was probably exhausted so him chilling on the couch also isn’t abnormal behavior. He also never called the vet or thought to cancel or change his errand if he was that concerned.****
I texted him and told him I was out of town about an hour later and told him if he gets worse to call the vet or my mom would go and pick up the dog. He never responded. Next day I texted and asked how the dog was doing and he said better but he is not his chipper self. I replied with “do you think Rue is acting “sick” because the back and forth back and forth every three or four days may be a lot on him. Can we try a week on week off schedule to get him on some sort of routine at both places.“ His response “I don’t think that’s his problem, you feed him too much shit when he’s with you. Followed by so where did you go the other night you abandoned your sick dog?” I have yet to response which I will not. I also am going to assume that I will have to pick him up Thursday or Friday and I am debating whether or not to continue letting Rue go there. Here’s why:
Is he not his chipper self because he would rather be with me and not stuck there alone? If he was that “sick” why did he not call the vet or change his plans? If he was actually sick and I had him I would have instantly called the vet not him. Is he just using the dog to try and control what I do because obviously he saw I wasn’t home and thought I would run right home to get the dog if he said he was sick that way he would know where I was?Am I doing the right or wrong thing for Rue?

This one was more likely deliberate because unless his memory is one of a goldfish I don’t see how he can forget.

21,1fehuqq,AITA for not adding my exs surname to my childs?,"Long story short, when my child A (5F) was born, we gave her my exs (38M) surname. I wanted to double barrel, but he talked me out of it because we were engaged and I ""have a crap surname"" (his words, not mine)

We split and he later went AWOL 3 months before her 2nd birthday. Because he has abandoned his 2 other kids, I assumed we would likely never see him again and legally changed her surname to mine. But because he's on the birth cert, I legally needed his consent, so technically the change wasnt valid.

1 year ago, he emailed out of the blue, saying he wanted to be in A's life. Baring in mind, we had heard NOTHING for 2&half years, I agreed to meet and talk through his reasoning, why now, etc. I agreed to supervised visits, building up to him having her on his own and we made a plan and discussed my expectations about contact and consistency etc.

After we agreed everything, I asked him to sign a letter giving consent for the name change, as I was trying to get her passport to go abroad. This is where I may be the A.

Since then, he has made more of an effort and she adores him. He rings most nights but sees her every 6-8 weeks as he works away and he refused to take a week off during the summer hols to have her because ""he didn't want to lose out on a grand""

On Monday he mentioned its coming up to a year and we can change her name and I outright admitted that I don't want to. That I had lied when I said I'd consider it and unless she asked me to add his name in the future, I don't see a need to. Changing it to mine had practical benefits, adding his is for his own wants.

He was very angry, called me toxic, petty, selfish, manipulative... Said I was controlling and that I treat him like a second class parent. I asked what the benefit would be to add it and he said because he wants the same name as her, so I called him a hypocrite because he was happy for me to not have the same name when she was born, but he justified that by saying I would have changed my name when we married anyway.

Long story short, when my child A (5F) was born, we gave her my exs (38M) surname. I wanted to double barrel, but he talked me out of it because we were engaged and I ""have a crap surname"" (his words, not mine)

We split and he later went AWOL 3 months before her 2nd birthday. Because he has abandoned his 2 other kids, I assumed we would likely never see him again and legally changed her surname to mine. But because he's on the birth cert, I legally needed his consent, so technically the change wasnt valid.

1 year ago, he emailed out of the blue, saying he wanted to be in A's life. Baring in mind, we had heard NOTHING for 2&half years, I agreed to meet and talk through his reasoning, why now, etc. I agreed to supervised visits, building up to him having her on his own and we made a plan and discussed my expectations about contact and consistency etc.

After we agreed everything, I asked him to sign a letter giving consent for the name change, as I was trying to get her passport to go abroad. This is where I may be the A.

Later that night my gf is mad and not talking to me. I have no idea why and ask her. She immediately raises her voice yelling at me saying “you wish I was her”.

23,1fehizo,AITA For no longer talking to my Parents for babying my 47 yr old brother?,"I am a (44) yr old female. For my entire life my folks have babied my older brother. As a child my brother tried to kill me multiple times. They never protected me from the abuse I suffered at my brothers hands. My parents always used the excuse that he was diagnosed as having Antisocial Personality Disorder. Fast forward to being an adult. My brother went through a nasty divorce where there was a battle for custody of their child. My parents bent over backwards for him, showing up to all hearings, paying for his Attorney ( including putting their house up for collateral ) and even covered the finances for a trip across the country to pick up his child after his ex-wife kidnapped her and went into hiding. 
A few years later, my brother filed for bankruptcy, causing my parents to lose their retirement to pay off the lawyer they helped my brother retain. If they didn’t pay him, they would lose their home put up as collateral .
Approximately 4 years later, I was going through an extremely contentious divorce. My ex husband is an iniquitous person who was and is extremely emotionally and mentally abusive our children and myself. He left me with our two children while I was 7.5 months pregnant stating he was no longer happy and I needed to figure out how to care for them on my own as he was no longer going to financially supporting us. I had never been allowed to be involved in the finances so I had no access. On top of that, he took everything of value leaving us destitute. 
After 5 years, my ex husband decided he wanted custody the children. After starting his own accounting firm and marrying an attorney from a wealthy family, hiring a less than upstanding attorney, he took me to court. I was unable to afford to hire an attorney so I asked my parents for help. They refused sighting the situation my brother had left them in. Not only that, they didn’t come to any hearings nor help me in any way whatsoever. 
Within my filings to the court, I had 17 letters from friends stating that I was the only caregiver for the children before and after he left. Not having an attorney to help me during the proceedings, I was completely steamrolled and the court named him the custodian. 
My children have gone through YEARS of abuse since; ie he made our 9yr old autistic daughter stand in the corner for an entire year for taking a few of his roommates protein bars. For that year she was only allowed to eat black beans and rice crackers for every meal. CPS did nothing. 
Our youngest ( the one I was pregnant with when he left ) had a medical condition which requires daily medication. He refused to give her her medication. I ended up taking her to the hospital where she was kept for 4 days to resolve the issues caused by his neglect. She had also suffered physical abuse which left scars on her body. The hospital called CPS concerned for our daughter’s wellbeing in her father’s home. CPS did nothing. 
After her release, I filed for a restraining order. I once again asked my parents to help me retain an attorney. Once again they refused, nor did they offer to help. During the court hearing the Judge refused to read any documents from the hospital and myself due to filing a restraining order instead of a temporary change to the parenting plan. This left our children in an extremely dangerous environment and completely devastated me. 

After all that has transpired, I stopped talking to my family. They are aware I’ve recently had a baby with my long time partner. I haven’t allowed my family to meet him, however I did ask my partner send them

24,1feha5s,AITA for not inviting my sister in law to my wife's birthday.,"I (34M) and my wife (29F) have decided not to invite her sister H and her sister’s husband C to my wife’s birthday. H for years has condescended us often giving backhanded comments about my job not being good enough, us not saving money, or other insults in regards to my family during the holidays. During Mother’s day we visited my wife’s mom and had taken our new puppy to the party to become accustomed to people. This was fine however H’s son, a rowdy 3yr old, was rough with the dog yanking his fur & leash and even hitting him with a stick at one point. Each time I had to step in and stop the child from harming my dog.  
  
After dinner on the lawn the nephew went over to begin tormenting the dog. At this point I raised my voice, due to everyone around being loud, and commanded him to stop. At this point H got upset and began screaming saying, “Just move the fucking dog! Just fucking move it if it’s such a fucking problem.” I was mad but I held it together and went to move the dog while my wife argued with H who was saying that she was tired of hearing us telling her kid to stop all day. After this the nephew immediately went over to the dog again and my wife pointed it out to H who began yelling saying, “Leave the fucking dog alone. They don’t want you near their dog because it’s a little fucking princess.” I immediately began to pack up our things and the rest of the family went inside as H, C, and my wife and I argued. They began yelling at us that we weren’t allowed to parent their child, that we were choosing the dog over their child, and that they didn’t know why we even bothered visiting the family anymore.

We left and talked things over. I made the decision that I wouldn’t be going to any family functions nor would they be welcome to any of ours until they apologized. My wife agreed. My wife’s birthday is coming up and I had made a FB group to plan it. Nobody gave input so after a talk with my wife we made plans for her birthday that she wanted. I posted this in the group and her mom contacted me saying she had wanted to do a party near them. I asked my wife what she wanted to do and she said she wanted to do the plans we’d made. I informed her mother of this and she then asked about why H and C hadn’t been invited to the FB group. I explained to her that due to their behavior at Mother’s Day they weren’t invited. Immediately they called me and her mother began yelling at me that I wasn’t allowed to not invite H and C because they’re family and I had to forgive them for how they’d acted. I told her that it was our choice to make and that until the situation was rectified they wouldn’t be attending. She continued to try to argue with me bringing God into the conversation, demanding that I was being controlling and trying to keep my wife from my family, and then breaking down into tears. In the end I held my resolve and made sure that they knew that our decision stayed until they reached out to us and apologized. So am I the asshole?

They both ran away together for almost a year before they got put back with their families.

Weird thing is even though Church is straight it sometimes feels like it's them dating and I'm the 3rd wheel. Church is weirdly possessive over Carlan. He always wants to crash our dates. He absolutely hated when I finally convinced Carlan to move out and in with me. They'll hold each other or even cuddle sometimes. He's always inviting himself over or into our personsl time and being all touchy feely with Carlan knowing it makes me uncomfortable. He has a girlfriend but he only ever wants to be all over Carlan.

I went home with them last week cause Carlans dad is in the hospital. I ended up meeting some old friends of theirs while there. I found out they don't really talk to Carlan much anymore. Mainly because they'd get into fights with Church usually over the same stuff and how Church never wanted anyone else around Carlan and Carlan would choose church. I tried to talk to Carlan about it when we were alone and he tried to tell me it wasn't like that. He says Church has always protected him and I got angry and I said been a creepy possessive weirdo isnt protectecting.

I got pretty good at it having been able to attend fun college parties while also maintaining a 4.0 GPA.

I got to the part where I talked about my art and this guy stops me mid-sentence and asks me, ""I'm sorry but I have to ask if you have ADHD or any sort of autism?""

I was completely caught off guard (1) because I've never been tested so answering that question falsely is just wrong and (2) he said it in the most unsettling and derogatory way. 

The other times happened when peers would try to say it as a joke because I talk quite fast. Well, the most recent instance was when I was watching Netflix with my boyfriend.

28,1fegsyc,AITA. My mother & I are starting to argue over my 2 dogs not being in my room 24/7,"My mother and I share a home and I have 2 dogs, that I take care of. Giving walks as much as I can, taking outside, take to the park, feeding, etc. She helps and she loves them as well. They are spoiled rotten.
So my dogs sleep in my room every night with me, in my bed. Also through out the day they are in and out of my room. There are some times I want my room to myself, through out the day. I have huskies, I clean frequently. I like to get all the dog hair out, and just clean up or sometimes I am working out or just trying to have some time to myself. Which I feel is normal.
Well, if I have my door shut sometimes the dogs will be sitting outside my door quietly or sometimes crying, but I was told in these situations you don’t give into them barking or whining because they will keep going (and it’s not like they need anything, they literally just want to be in my room). My mom is constantly talking to them and nagging me during this period oh they want to be in there with you, Santina let them in, I mean this is everyday before she goes to work because this is when they usually aren’t in my room for a hour or 2.
So today I hear her saying “this is fucking ridiculous, so fucking stupid” just talking crap; so I go out there and she’s telling me I shouldn’t have dogs and calling me a bitch, and I’m really fixing to go off. 
Keep in mind when me and my brother were babies, my mom kept our dog Lexus in the basement most of the time because she didn’t want dog hair and etc around us and this is why she feels guilty I think. But I do not think this is normal to be acting like this, I don’t feel they need to be in my room 24/7 when they are already in here a good remainder of the day. All it is doing is making them more entitled to being here and they’re going to keep barking and raising commotion when they’re not in here!

29,1fegnk0,AITAH for refusing to sell our home?,"My husband and I are having a disagreement and I need someone to tell me if I'm the asshole, or if I'm making the right decision. 

My husband (33m) and I (32f) moved from
Ontario to Nova Scotia Canada in 2017. 
In 2019 we purchased our first home for $159,900. A beautiful 4 bedroom, 2 bathroom home, huge backyard that leads into the school yard of my children's elementary school  in an upper middle class neighborhood. 

We have a current 1st mortgage on the home from a B-Lender at 3.25%, which includes our property tax in the monthly payment ($912 a month total) and $108,000 remaining on the mortgage. 

We have a second mortgage from a private lender (long story short, we owned a second income property that needed major repairs and we took out a private mortgage on that property to cover the repairs, but then upon the sale of the income property - there wasn't enough funds to cover the private lender so we absorbed the private mortgage as a second mortgage on our primary property). 
The remaining balance on that private lender in second position is $42,500 ($900 a month interest only payments). 

We have the ability to pay additional payments on the second mortgage and have it completely paid out in 5 years. 

We have no other debts except for a small credit card balance of $5000.

My husband wants to sell our primary property (which is real estate assessed at $289,900) and move over an hour out of town to the middle of no where to purchase a home around $130,000 - 150,000, which would not be the same quality as the home we currently own (our current home is fully renovated and updated). His theory is we would be completely debt free and have better quality of life, where right now we are going paycheck
To paycheck. 

The kids would have to move schools, lose friends and my son, who was recently diagnosed with ASD level 2 would have to change all his medical care practitioners and early interventionists.  

My reasoning is in the next few years, we can have our 2nd mortgage paid off, have a higher income and less bill payments as I begin reducing our monthly costs by budgeting properly and we can stay in our current home atleast the next 12 years until our youngest graduates from the elementary school next door. 

My husband is dead-set on selling, but at the end of the day we are both on the deed. 

Am I the asshole for putting my foot down and refusing to sell? Or should we sell and become a debt free faster? 

TL;DR husband wants to sell and become debt free right away, I want to stay and put lump sum payments on our debt over the next 5 years.

I’m in my early twenties and after college, I noticed myself putting distance between me and some people I took classes with.

After graduating, I began to realize that I wasn’t interested in continuing relationships with a lot of them. They aren’t bad people, they never did anything wrong, I just felt less passionate about seeing them/didn’t feel excited to hang out or even talk. I didn’t feel much joy when we would hang out, and facetiming to “catch up” began to feel like a chore. I feel like a bad person because I am aware that I am a “fake friend” to these people.

I have a lot of other friends that I have been with for a very long time (around a decade now) and can say with confidence that I am there for them when they need me, and am a good friend to them. To me, this is my true close circle, and friends I wanna have for the rest of my life.

On the flip side, there are a lot of people that consistently reach out to me about hanging out or keeping up that I admit I am very distant and unreliable to. I feel it takes too much of my energy to keep up with these people that I don’t feel a very strong connection with, and I feel a lot of shame and guilt about it.

31,1feglgc,AITA for telling my cousin my entire family think he is taking a bad decision?,"
I will use fake names and fake countries:

I (F24) have been living abroad for the past 7 years. I moved to a few different countries, and the way I keep in touch with my parents is by texting and via a weekly call on weekends, where we tell each others what happened during the week, I also always ask about other family members. 

My mom has told me in the past 3 months that one of my cousin, ‘Tom’ (M40) - (he is married to his wife (F45) and has a young kid (F3) - wants to move to Sweden, as he and his wife really like this country. His wife is not from my home country (don’t know if that’s relevant). They do not speak Swedish, however Sweden (fake country, don’t know if that’s actually true) does kind of speaks fluent English and they are ok with English. 

My mom, and my entire mom’s sides family say they are crazy, it’s too risky to move without a job, they are being dumb and will regret…. Now, I do understand that moving abroad, especially with a young kid, without a job is taking a huge risk. However, they are giving themselves a year and have savings, so im really supporting them. 

As someone who’s been abroad and who doesn’t want to go back to my home country, I kind of understand them, and as their kid is young, I think it’s the best time now (rather than wait until the kid grows, makes friends ect). 

Do I think it’s risky? Yes. Do I think they should do it? Yes.

Anyways, it was my cousin’s birthday a few days ago so I wished him. I don’t usually talk to him. I sent him a text and he thanked me and ask how I was doing. We started talking and I told him ‘I know our family doesn’t support you with moving but I do, (gave him a few tips) and he was a bit shocked that I said ‘family doesn’t support you’. 

My mom texted me yesterday and asked why TF I told him that, that I shouldn’t have told him no one supports him. She feels embarrassed now. The entire family (except my dad who has also lived abroad many years) is pissed at me. 

The way my family knew I told him is because they have a group chat (which I’m not a part off, no one ever invited me in it and I only learned from it by looking at my mom’s notification), and he asked on the group chat if what I said was true.

Trying to understand if I was the AH, because in my perspective, why act fake? I’ve heard my mom and other family members talking shit about him for 3 months now, I’ve debated with them and tried to make them understand my point of view, without success. I also thought they had told him they didn’t think it was a great idea. I’m a pretty honest person, so I don’t understand why my family tells me they don’t support him and they are being dumb, but they say nothing to his face. For me, family is supposed to help each other and be honest with each other. Not just lie and keep face. 

Idk but if info needed just let me know

I (18, M) came into the world fulfilling his wishes. I did very well in academics. Scoring well raised his expectations.

The first shock came at 11, I was banned from going outside after playing beyond 150 meters. As an only child with no cousins, I played alone, crafting toys from boxes and drowning in my imagination. Discipline ruled my life—set times for everything, mostly for studying. At 13, TV was taken away because it was 'distracting', and I stopped confiding in my mom after realizing that she ratted everything to dad. Moreover I was constantly compared to a girl, neighbour who outscored me, which was brutal.

Teenage years and lockdown brought the internet to me for the first time, and soon, clashes with my father escalated. I would ot bend to his will easily. Arguments turned into thrashings. I cried almost daily, cursing my fate for being born to him and contemplating s-harm. My father became my mortal enemy, but luckily I found a solace- novels. They became my escape. I read them secretly, defying his bans after he thought it was distracting me. Naturally I had to endure beatings when caught.

By 17, I had calmed, though I still faced insults, taunts and occasional beatings. Perhaps it was me or perhaps I was forced since childhood into engineering but nothing appealed to me. My creative pursuits in writing and music were crushed. When I tried to reason with my father, we hit a deadlock, and I spent my 11th grade resenting him. In 12th, I grew more mature, but his control tightened. My life was rigid—study, sleep, repeat for six days straight. Even my reading was limited only to Sundays, and internet access was banned according to him since 9th grade.

But then again I cannot be completely detached to them. Despite several meltdowns, whenever I see a parent sad after their child left them in their old age, I cannot but feel hurt for my thoughts. I know that they are doing it for my own good and that they have sacrificed a lot. I know that they love me, but I am well past the limits. I respect them a lot but I cannot love them. My life has become hell due to them where everyday I am chipped mentally, but the guilt of leaving someone who cared and raised me behind also burdens me a lot. It is even more heartbreaking when my father says that he only wants my presence during his old age, but the same him threatens to end my life in anger as ‘it is better to be childless than carry a burden’.

(they are a bit on the feminine side, and is often mistaken as my gay best friend rather than my partner.) i knew this going into the relationship and it did not bother me at all. my partner is very understanding and loving, so it’s totally not their fault! their best friend whom i’ll call “Julia” and «Oliver» have been friends since high school. i understood quickly that’s she’s kinda prickly, and often gaslights my partner and makes them feel guilty for a lot of things. 

one time when we were talking, my partner mentioned that she hits them sometimes when he is saying something sassy or joking around, and i jokingly (very much jokingly) said that i’d do something drastic if i saw that in real life (keep in mind, i have not met this girl yet). my partner mentioned this, in the same joking tone, to her in a group chat they were in… and all hell broke loose. she overreacted massively, and told him that i don’t know her well enough to joke about that. i could understand her reaction at the time, but it was a certain inside joke between me and my partner, and my partner thought she would get it since she has quite the dark humor herself. she did not find that funny at all, and keeps bringing it up whenever my partner mentions me.

36,1fefd90,AITA for initially laughing after seeing my bf shaved his facial hair? ,"throwaway lol. my boyfriend (24m) and i (21f) have been officially together for around 5 months. he’s had a full beard the entire time i’ve known him, and i guess he’s mostly kept a beard since he started growing facial hair around 15, so the only pictures i’ve seen of him without one are from when he was in middle school or younger. 

yesterday when he was on lunch at work he facetimed me and surprised me that he had gone fully shaved. he didn’t tell me he was planning it so it kind of shocked me. when i answered the phone my first thought was that it was actually his hs aged brother that he lives with (that looks a lot like him), and when i realized it was him i kind of gasped and then couldn’t help myself from laughing for a minute. 

obviously he seemed kind of upset but i tried to make sure and tell him that i still like how he looks, i was just very surprised because he looks decently different and much much younger without facial hair and i wasn’t expecting to answer the call to that. 

he still seemed upset and quickly hung up afterwards, said something like “this is why i never fully shave”. i was supposed to see him today but he’s been pretty dry with few responses since then. AITA for my reaction? 

EDIT: yes, i would definitely be upset if he initially laughed at me for cutting/dyeing my hair, but i’d also expect it from at least a person or two if i fully shaved my head out of nowhere. either way, i know it probably hurt him more than i thought and i already apologized to him for laughing at first over text. planning to apologize in person too the next time i see him, and don’t worry i will be showering him with compliments because i do think he still looks great!

40,1feele5,AITAH for telling a childhood friend off?,"Hey there. This may seem like a ridiculous post, but it is bothering me a bit.

So, I have a guy friend that I grew up with that will text me frequently. A good portion of the time I enjoy our conversations, but once and I while I feel like he crosses the line. We are both married.

Our healthy texts usually consist of life, conspiracy topics or philosophical ideas. I love that, as I’m extremely open minded, and have only a small handful of friends that can relate to these unconventional conversations.

He’s overall a good person that has sound advice as well.

However, since we’ve reconnected over the past decade he just gives way too many complements, and overall gets a bit inappropriate IMHO. Basically asking for pictures. When I go on vacation asking for bikini pictures. I get lip filler, so he constantly asks to see my lips when I get them done and jokes about DSL’s. He also has a nickname for me that begins BB* (Big Busty *). I never really respond after that. In general, just says a lot of stuff that feels flirtatious, and I know it’d piss my husband off. My husband has full access to my phone, and has in fact read some of his messages and was not pleased. I have blocked him/ghosted him on and off when he gets out of line. I finally just told him off last night after him asking how long my husband’s recovery from his vasectomy is (he just had it done yesterday). I told him up to 12 weeks. He then responds, “12 weeks and no sex? Good thing I’ll be in MN for a game this next month. At least you can get laid for your birthday then.” He then asked me if I still work out as much as I did before, and asked if my body still looked the same. Like what the AF?
I was a size zero in my first marriage, and have put on a good 10-15 lbs. I’m now a size 4. I more or less tell him that, and he pushes further with, “I’m sure you’re just as sexy.”
This just made me snap. Snap huge. I tried to make the sex comment as a joke, but couldn’t. I was literally just going to blow him off again, but decided not to.

I basically said  “I appreciate the complements, and our friendship, but there are many times that you’ve crossed the line with what you’ve said to me. I also feel that your actions are very disrespectful to both of our spouses. This is why I’ve blown you off for weeks/months in the past.”

Think he was completely taken aback. He apologized, and said he will try to be more platonic. That threw me through a hoop-shouldn’t he be acting platonic to begin with? I never have once engaged in flirtatious gestures that I have realized. The moment he crosses the line, I temporarily blow him off. I would think that he would have gotten the hint, but never has. It’s even more ironic as he’s a psychologist. We both live on opposite ends of the country, and haven’t seen one another in 7 years. He’s in Portland, I’m in Minneapolis.

42,1fee4yx,AITA for yelling at my friends for charging me money for me apologising?,"Some context. I(18,F) have a problem with apologising. Eversince I was a kid I always was blamed for everything and was yelled at, I was also bulied with ruined my confidence. I apologise so much cause I always fell like I do a mistake or annoy people. I don't want to make anyone angry.

My friends know that I have this problem but never explained to them why cause I think that it would not mater. 
My two friends both 17, one male the other female decided(without me knowing) that everytime me and another friend(who also apologises a lot) apologise we would owe them some cash. Idk if they ment it as a joke or for real.
I was not happy by hearing that but decided to hide it and just go with it(context I never gave them any money for apologising). 

The 1st day I played cool tho still sometimes would act a bit anoyed, they didn't take it seariously.
The 2nd day I was more anoyed. I would tell them that they wouldn't get it dead or alive or I would tell them work for it(ofc as a joke but I still hoped they would take me seriously,they didn't). 

Then on one class when my other friend apologised the male instead of lifting the price to 500 he lowered it(or just forgot the original price) to 150. It made me angry. It wasn't fair.

Im sorry.",Asshole,2024-09-11,"AITA for yelling at my friends for charging me money for me apologising? Some context. I(18,F) have a problem with apologising. Eversince I was a kid I always was blamed for everything and was yelled at, I was also bulied with ruined my confidence. I apologise so much cause I always fell like I do a mistake or annoy people. I don't want to make anyone angry.

My friends know that I have this problem but never explained to them why cause I think that it would not mater. 
My two friends both 17, one male the other female decided(without me knowing) that everytime me and another friend(who also apologises a lot) apologise we would owe them some cash. Idk if they ment it as a joke or for real.
I was not happy by hearing that but decided to hide it and just go with it(context I never gave them any money for apologising). 

The 1st day I played cool tho still sometimes would act a bit anoyed, they didn't take it seariously.
The 2nd day I was more anoyed. I would tell them that they wouldn't get it dead or alive or I would tell them work for it(ofc as a joke but I still hoped they would take me seriously,they didn't). 

Then on one class when my other friend apologised the male instead of lifting the price to 500 he lowered it(or just forgot the original price) to 150. It made me angry. It wasn't fair. I said that to him and that Im angry at him but he wasn't listening, he was caught up talking to someone(with I understand).

We hadn't really discussed about if  everybody was certain about coming to the party but all of them had said at some point that they would definitely be attending. Now my birthday is in four days and I wanted to ask for confirmation on about who's coming. I asked everyone in our friend group and everyone said  that they wouldn't be attending  my birthday party because they had other things. We had planned the date long time ago and it was supposed to be the weekend when we all were free and when my real birthday was. So September 15th. But now suddenly everyone had something.

They both won't  be coming because of that. Then one of the girls said  she needs to go to her grandparents house for the weekend and why she couldn't come and the last girl said she needed to go hiking with her dad.

         Im not angry at them at all because i know i should have maybe asked them if they are certain about coming earlier, but i was still kinda taken a back and sad.

         So after everyone had said they wouldn't come I wrote In our group chat how I was kinda hurt by that nobody was coming after weeks of talking and preparation. I have already bought stuff for the party but I don't know what I'm gonna do with the stuff now. 
         After I had sent that message I got them all texting me how ""pick me"" I am for putting myself first in this.

45,1fedijy,AITA for painting in the bathroom ,"Me (37f) and my husband (42m) renewed our en-suite bathroom a couple of months ago. (For the record, we live alone in 3-bed bungalow, with two bathrooms and one guest toilet.) During the planning I fell in love with photos I've seen on IG of DIYers refurbishing old glazed cupboards into linen cabinets and I wanted one like that, too. Hubby was indifferent about the idea, said he just wants somewhere to keep extra soaps and towels, if I want artsy-fartsy, it's up to me. 

I made sure new bathroom layout allowed for a large piece of freestanding furniture, but it wasn't easy to find the right one. I kept updating hubby about the search at first, but he said he doesn't really care, so I stopped. Finally after about three months I found my dream antique (pretty old in any case) cupboard. The seller agreed to deliver it for an extra fee and soon two strapping gents put the cupboard in my en-suite. And that's where I realised that the piece is really heavy and can't be dismantled (dove and tail joinery), I couldn't even slide it out cause there's a step between bathroom and bedroom. I decided to move our small stuff (toothbrushes, soaps, razors etc) to the other bathroom, wrapped the rest in plastic, and after giving the piece a good clean I put on first coat of primer. I then brought in an air purifier to speed up drying and prevent the smell, opened the window wide, locked the doors and put around an extra sheet of plastic, left a note for the hubby when he comes back from work that DYI is in progress, please use other bathroom, I'm off to walk our dog.

I thought I did everything right, but when I came back, husband was livid. Asked if I've gone out of my mind, why did I use paint in the bathroom, who does that, what was I thinking. I said I didn't think it was a big deal, during renewal we used the other bathroom for weeks, and in en-suite we drilled,  plastered, painted and tiled, so I don't see what's the problem if I paint in there for a couple extra days.

46,1fedbm8,"AITA for not going to my friend's ""wedding"" after what she said to me? ","A few months ago, a friend of mine told me she was getting married, it wasn't meant to be a regular wedding but more of an elopment kind of thing. We were supposed to be her, the groom, me (as a Maid of Honor) and a Best man, plus a few close family member, about 10 people in total, and it was planned for early November. 

I say ""wedding"" like that in the title because there will be no invites, no ""save the date"", no ceremony, no walk down the isle, just courthouse and dinner (that comes from the bride herself, I'm not guessing anything). 

A week ago I got the news that I had gotten a permanent job, I don't know how to explain it because this is a very typical thing from my country, Spain, where  every  so often, the government will hire professionals to work either in the administration or in public institutions (education, highschool...) This is usually a great opportunity because these positions are for life (well, until you retire) and they can never fire you. In order to apply for these positions, you have to take an exam, and then depending on your years of service to the institution and the score you get on the exam, you can get one of those jobs. 

Long story short, I took my exam last year and last week I got told that I got one of the jobs, but I will be moving cities for that. 

When I told my friend this, the only thing she said is ""when are you leaving?? Can you still come to my wedding?"" No congratulations, no ""i'm happy for you"", nothing.

My parents are divorced. But there's a twist. They were already divorced when I was conceived (like a couple of weeks after). Dad was clear he wanted to be in my life. Mom and him didn't get back together. While mom was pregnant with me she met her husband (Dan). It started awkward especially when Dan showed up to the hospital when mom was in labor but dad was in the delivery room.

It got worse during mom and Dan's engagement because he wanted to take me out of state for 4 nights without mom. Dad needed to give permission for it to happen but dad said no. Dan argued that he was going to be my second dad, I'd grow up with two dads, and how he should be trusted to take me out of state for 4 nights. Dan was always talking shit about my dad and telling me about that incident and how dad treated him like a lesser parent. He also talked about dad pushing him (Dan) out of the delivery room which makes me think there's a lot of jealousy over that still too. He also mentioned the fact my parents were divorced before I came along. I hated Dan for doing that and my loyalty is with my dad. I have rejected Dan every possible way and Dan blames my dad for that. My mom never told Dan to knock it off. She would also encourage us to spend time together. I made Dan's life hell when I was younger in retaliation for how he talked about my dad. I also made a few big scenes when Dan would try making others believe he was my dad. I did this in front of my half brother too. I probably hate Dan as much as Dan hates my dad.

My half brother has grown up knowing how I feel about Dan and how Dan feels about my dad. So he hates my dad on Dan's behalf. He doesn't like how I treat Dan. Which means we fight a lot. My half brother tries to say Dan is a better dad and I should treat him better and shit. We do not like each other.

Our relationship, if you can even call it that, sank when I told my half brother I would never like or respect Dan and I would celebrate if him and mom divorced and I would never see him again.

I hated mom's house so last year dad, on my behalf, asked the judge to let him have custody. I was interviewed and custody was changed. But I still have to go one weekend a month until I'm 18.

49,1feco5b,AITAH if I stop cooking for my boyfriend?,"My boyfriend and I made an agreement that because I come home later from work than he does, he cooks dinner and I cook lunch.

It’s been going well so far, but he doesn’t put in nearly as much effort cooking dinner as I do lunch. For example, his dinner for us is mostly microwaving frozen foods. I go on the pan and cook us food I buy from the grocery store. Chicken, vegetables, dumplings, etc, meaning my food takes a lot of effort and I am excited for us to eat it and happy my effort will pay off as we will be eating something healthy and nutritious. 

The issue is, he doesn’t want to eat my food unless I pack it for him. (?) I usually make the food, and expect that both of us pack our own lunch. Nope, he refuses to eat it unless I pack his lunch for him.

So me, feeling slightly offended, decides to not pack his lunch at all from that day on. And from that day on, he did not eat any of the food I cooked for us. So for many days, I was left eating 2x the portions because he was not eating them, or I was left throwing it away. He would rather starve than pack his own lunch. 

AITAH if I stop packing his lunch for him? I feel really bad eating nutritious food while he’s left starving or eating frozen foods but at the same time I feel like he kind of did it to himself. I cooked for you and all you have to do is scoop it into a container.

Edit: NO it is not difficult for me to put food in a container for him. I just don’t understand why he can’t do it himself. I cooked the food. He is not disabled/ handicapped. I don’t expect him to plate my dinners for me. It is not about time wasted packing lunch, it is about the principle. I feel like I am his girlfriend, not his mother.

Another edit is that I want to include something so it’s fair. He doesn’t ALWAYS do frozen foods for dinner. Occasionally he will actually cook stuff but he says he hates cooking so it’s usually just some meat and nothing else. For example, a steak but nothing else. Just a steak on a pan— no sides, no vegetables, no sauce, no nothing, just a steak with some salt and pepper. Low effort food that takes 10 mins tops to do, so wouldn’t actually take up too much of his time. He has time to pack his own food. And no he does not plate it for me. I don’t expect him to. Chicken but there’s nothing else but peas. Pasta but it’s just pasta and chicken and canned tomato sauce. Macaroni and cheese but it’s boxed. Stuff like that. 

Another edit because a lot of people are suggesting he just buys his lunch and that’s why he’s not packing it: he does not buy his lunch. I’m like 99.99% sure of this. I know how he is. He is very much against spending money outside for food. He only spends money on food when we go out on dates/ when he has to buy things for his hobbies. I have seen the way he is when he has no lunch. He will a can of tuna and a can of pineapples from our emergency pantry if he has to,he will not buy food outside. So yes, while I am eating the nutritious food I cooked us, he is eating really shitty food all because he doesn’t want to pack it

Edit: we are both 22.


FINAL EDIT: I talked to him about it and he said it’s okay we can just make our own food from now on. So I guess now I’m making my own dinners and my own lunches and so is he. Not ideal but oh well I guess. Really would’ve liked us to talk it out and actually start cooking for each other & simply served ourselves but it’s okay. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITAH if I stop cooking for my boyfriend? My boyfriend and I made an agreement that because I come home later from work than he does, he cooks dinner and I cook lunch.

It’s been going well so far, but he doesn’t put in nearly as much effort cooking dinner as I do lunch. For example, his dinner for us is mostly microwaving frozen foods. I go on the pan and cook us food I buy from the grocery store. Chicken, vegetables, dumplings, etc, meaning my food takes a lot of effort and I am excited for us to eat it and happy my effort will pay off as we will be eating something healthy and nutritious. 

The issue is, he doesn’t want to eat my food unless I pack it for him. (?) I usually make the food, and expect that both of us pack our own lunch. Nope, he refuses to eat it unless I pack his lunch for him.

So me, feeling slightly offended, decides to not pack his lunch at all from that day on. And from that day on, he did not eat any of the food I cooked for us. So for many days, I was left eating 2x the portions because he was not eating them, or I was left throwing it away. He would rather starve than pack his own lunch. 

AITAH if I stop packing his lunch for him? I feel really bad eating nutritious food while he’s left starving or eating frozen foods but at the same time I feel like he kind of did it to himself. I cooked for you and all you have to do is scoop it into a container.

Edit: NO it is not difficult for me to put food in a container for him. I just don’t understand why he can’t do it himself. I cooked the food. He is not disabled/ handicapped. I don’t expect him to plate my dinners for me. It is not about time wasted packing lunch, it is about the principle. I feel like I am his girlfriend, not his mother.

Another edit is that I want to include something so it’s fair. He doesn’t ALWAYS do frozen foods for dinner. Occasionally he will actually cook stuff but he says he hates cooking so it’s usually just some meat and nothing else. For example, a steak but nothing else. Just a steak on a pan— no sides, no vegetables, no sauce, no nothing, just a steak with some salt and pepper. Low effort food that takes 10 mins tops to do, so wouldn’t actually take up too much of his time. He has time to pack his own food. And no he does not plate it for me. I don’t expect him to.

","I (44F) have a son (22M) who dated “Sarah” (21F) for about six months. Sarah has been part of our lives for ages—she’s been my daughter’s best friend since kindergarten. So, when my son and Sarah started dating in high school, my husband and I were not exactly thrilled. We knew how close she was with our family, and we warned my son from the beginning that if things didn’t work out, Sarah wouldn’t just disappear from our lives. But, of course, he didn’t listen. 

She broke up with him in the spring, claimed it wasn't working out. Since the breakup, Sarah has stayed close with my daughter and continues to be around. She’s like a second daughter to us. I am not banning her from the home or events that she always been invited too

The problem is, my son can’t seem to handle it. Every time Sarah is around, he get angry and usally storms off.

Yesterday Sara stopped over to pick up my daughter. They both commute to college since we live near a city. My son did not react well and screamed at her to get out of his home. His sister got in a huge fight with him. He claims that his sister was betraying him for being friends with her.  I stepped in wnd reminded him that we warned him when they first started dating—Sarah was never going to disappear from our lives just because they broke up. She’s been part of the family for years, and that’s not going to change. That 

I told him he needs to grow up and get over it. He can’t expect the whole family to cut off Sarah because they aren’t together anymore. It’s not fair to Sarah or the rest of us.

51,1fec78y,AITAH for washing the bathroom carpet of my flatmate?,"Hey all, I (27) moved into a flat with a woman (47) about 1 ½ weeks ago. It's a temporary situation until the end of the year, by which time I hope to find my own place. Unfortunately, I got Covid last week and have mostly been staying in my room, with occasional interactions with my flatmate. We’ve gotten along well so far, but today we had our first argument, which honestly felt a bit absurd to me.

What happened was that yesterday my joints started hurting, especially one knee. My flatmate suggested I take a salt bath, and while I considered it, I wasn’t motivated since I’d need to clean the bathtub first.

Here’s the issue: I haven’t said anything, but the apartment is a bit too dirty for my taste. I find it tolerable but borderline in some areas. Instead of mentioning it, I’ve been cleaning small areas when alone, over the last week and a half, to avoid seeming aggressive.

Today, my leg pain got worse, so I decided to deep clean the tub for a bath. I also cleaned the bath mat since it was pretty dirty (the vacuum broke recently). I shook it out and gathered towels to start a wash. I could only fill the washing machine halfway (I asked my flatmate if she had anything to wash too).

Later, as I unloaded the machine, she gave me a critical look and commented that it wasn’t full. I said, “Yeah, sorry, I know it’s not very eco-friendly, but I really needed to wash the bath mat.” She took that very personally and accused me of controlling and rude behavior, which shocked me since I didn’t see it that way. If I had my own bath mat, I’d have just switched it for a clean one (I think she only owns one).

She then got upset about other things, like 4 moving boxes I still had in the hallway, even though we agreed it was okay until the 14th because I got sick. I had started some projects in my room to maximize space since it’s small but hadn’t finished due to Covid.

Honestly, I was surprised by how upset she got, as I’ve been trying hard not to make her feel like I think she’s dirty (even though I do). She even said the bath mat wasn’t dirty at all—well, sorry, but it was too dirty for me to step on.

However, since I left my last boyfriend and moved into a house of my own my mother has started to come around WAY more often....more than I prefer. I am an extreme introvert with 2 boys who are extremely liked and have loads of friends on our street. But its not like a typical situation where she comes for a day or maybe even a weekend a then leaves to go back home. No, she stays for an extended period of time. As i type this she was here for 8 days straight, left for 2 days and has now been here another 4 days and counting I know for a FACT she knows that I am annoyed but it does not phase her at all. 

My mom is unmarried, lives alone and I am her only child. My mom is still hereWhy cant she just be like a normal older Mom and visit for a couple hours or a day and then go home. Then I start feeling bad because she'll cook dinner, or buy me or the boys something and try to be all sweet and nice. But its like why can't you just go home!! I spoke to her sister/my aunt about it and she said that ""you know your Mom just misses her grandchildren"". And i get that but still, does that give her a pass to constantly be at out house for days and weeks at a time. I've been asking her everyday since she returned back this time when she is going home and she'll either ignore me or tell me ""IDK"". Like wtf you mean ?? I could see if this was like a once in a blue moon thing. But this is almost an every month occurrence.

 On top of that her and I live 2 different lives. I am a very clean person, which probably stems from the way she kept the house while i was growing up as a kid,. I remember getting teased when i would let a friend come over and the floor was covered in piles of clothes from where she just throws things on the floor and wont pick them up. When my mom is here she leaves her bras on the floor, underwear on my couch, shoes in the middle of the living room, unwashed dishes in the kitchen, she uses the bathroom with the door wide open. I already feel overwhelmed with just me and my boys here. So when my mom is here it drives me absolutely nuts.

 Im tearing up while typing all this now. Sometimes I feel like I'm being dramatic but sometimes I feel like its crossing boundaries.

My mother doesn't adore her but they're not fighting everyday. Rhea is very respectful to my mother and looked after her last year after an eye surgery she had. 

My mother is a home maker and my father has been out on a business trip. Three days ago, Rhea fainted in the kitchen and I rushed her to the ER. She had been over-exerting herself and got an IV and some supplements and further instructions. I asked her if she would like to use her vacation to rest a bit since she has been working non-stop. She is an orphan (her mother passed away during childbirth and her father passed away due to cancer when she was 19) and doesn't have any immediate family. 

She applied for a sick leave of five days to get some rest after almost 1.5 years of no days off except weekends.

Despite that, we're getting her checked up to see if anything's wrong. I didn't want to leave her alone in the house so I asked my mother if she would be okay if Rhea came over and stayed/slept in my room at night (Rhea suggested we ask just for nights because she didn't want my mother to feel burdened) because she fainted twice within three days and I don't want to take any risks.

And she's also been really kind to my mother, helping me take care of her last year when she had her eye surgery so that's the least she can do for someone who will soon be family (yes, I'm planning to propose).

56,1feawu4,AITA for the way I reacted to my friends pregnancy? ,"So I am a 22 year old university student and (almost) all my friends are 18 - 25 year old students/recent graduates living in my uni town. Also almost all my friends are lgbt and in queer relationships so there is rarely a pregnancy scare in my friend groups but when there is it is always a negative thing. 

One of my closest friends from my hometown is 31yr old Sadie, who is a heterosexual woman. In the 10 years I have been friends with her she has never had a serious or long term relationship, just a series of situationships and one night stands. She is financially stable and supports herself/is not a student but she has always said she never wants kids and never wants to settle down. 

I stayed in my uni town over the summer while I finished my masters so I haven't seen Sadie for a while but we talk every day and she's never said anything about getting into a relationship. 2 weeks ago we didn't talk for 3 days and I was getting worried about her and then she texted me, randomly at 3am ""I'm pregnant...."" so I responded ""oh shit! are we happy or sad about this? whos the father?"" because I didn't want to celebrate too soon as everything I've known about her makes me think she wouldn't be happy about this. 

She didn't respond but over 24 hours later she called me to chew me out on the phone, telling me why couldn't I just be happy for her and that it is really rude and disrespectful to ask the questions I did, I told her that none of my other friends would be happy about it and shes always spoken about how she didn't want kids so I just wanted to make sure I was reacting properly and she didn't sound positive about it in her message. She said I was psychoanalysing her and shes an adult so she can do whatever she wants and that if I'm going to be negative she doesn't need me in her life. If she'd told me she was happy about it I would've been happy for her and supportive I just didn't know. She also said she trusted me by telling me and she hadn't told anyone else and also it was really invasive of me to ask about her sex life (in our entire friendship she's always told me about her sex life because we are open like that). Then she hung up on me and we haven't spoken since, she's ignored all my texts and calls. AITA? I'm worried I've lost a close friend over this, we've never fought like this before, but also idk if what I said was so wrong so I just wanted to get an outside opinion. Thanks :)

Edit: Hey sorry I was out all day I just wanted to answer the 2 questions I've seen the most! we actually became friends aged 13 and 21 in February 2015 so nearly 10 years not a full 10 years, she was almost 22 at the time! We met online in a fandom and later found out we live in the same city! Nothing weird has ever gone on! 
Also I'm in the UK, started uni at 18 and just finishing up my masters now aged 22, 23 in Nov :) Also she still has not texted me back! Thanks all for your comments, I'm going home for Christmas and if we haven't spoken by then I'll see if she wants to meet up. 
",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for the way I reacted to my friends pregnancy?  So I am a 22 year old university student and (almost) all my friends are 18 - 25 year old students/recent graduates living in my uni town. Also almost all my friends are lgbt and in queer relationships so there is rarely a pregnancy scare in my friend groups but when there is it is always a negative thing. 

One of my closest friends from my hometown is 31yr old Sadie, who is a heterosexual woman. In the 10 years I have been friends with her she has never had a serious or long term relationship, just a series of situationships and one night stands. She is financially stable and supports herself/is not a student but she has always said she never wants kids and never wants to settle down. 

I stayed in my uni town over the summer while I finished my masters so I haven't seen Sadie for a while but we talk every day and she's never said anything about getting into a relationship. 2 weeks ago we didn't talk for 3 days and I was getting worried about her and then she texted me, randomly at 3am ""I'm pregnant...."" so I responded ""oh shit! are we happy or sad about this? whos the father?"" because I didn't want to celebrate too soon as everything I've known about her makes me think she wouldn't be happy about this. 

She didn't respond but over 24 hours later she called me to chew me out on the phone, telling me why couldn't I just be happy for her and that it is really rude and disrespectful to ask the questions I did, I told her that none of my other friends would be happy about it and shes always spoken about how she didn't want kids so I just wanted to make sure I was reacting properly and she didn't sound positive about it in her message. She said I was psychoanalysing her and shes an adult so she can do whatever she wants and that if I'm going to be negative she doesn't need me in her life. If she'd told me she was happy about it I would've been happy for her and supportive I just didn't know. She also said she trusted me by telling me and she hadn't told anyone else and also it was really invasive of me to ask about her sex life (in our entire friendship she's always told me about her sex life because we are open like that). Then she hung up on me and we haven't spoken since, she's ignored all my texts and calls. AITA? I'm worried I've lost a close friend over this, we've never fought like this before, but also idk if what I said was so wrong so I just wanted to get an outside opinion. Thanks :)

57,1featn1,AITA for yelling at my friend for what she said about my grandma? ,"Im 17f and my friend is 18f...now for context behind it, my grandma is born on September 11th, which yes, is also 9/11 that everyone knows. Because of this, my grandma doesn't like being reminded of her birthday as much.

Now for the main part, me and my friend(who we'll call amy) were talking when our conversation ended up like this

Me: ""oh i forgot...my grandma's birthday is in a couple days..""

Friend: ""oh...""

Me: ""yeah! I wanna get her something small since she doesn't like her birthday-""

Friend: ""wait wait...shes born on 9/11...the same 9/11 that made history 9/11?!""

Me(whos confused on what shes talking about: ""....yeah?"" 

Friend: ""wow...im sorry, but thats selfish! You care about your grandma's birthday rather than the people who lost their lives?"" 

Me: ""what?!"" 

And then we started arguing(cause i refuse to keep doing that whole roleplay thing) with me saying i couldn't change her birthday, and she said i was being selfish, to which followed she wa a bad friend for making me seem like the bad person for caring about my grandma, whos birthday is arguably on the worst days to think of...and its not like i can change that...after i left, i got message from her and another friend saying i was a bad friend and im cruel for saying that and defending someone rather than people who lost their lives, yet my parents are saying i didn't do nothing and i was defending my grandma and yet i feel guilty cause me being sensitive, i overthink like a tsunami and don't know if im the bad person or not...

So AITA??

58,1feakpr,AITAH for moving out months after my mom died ,"I 23F recently decided to move out with my boyfriend 23M. For context I was parentified in my house growing up and was always the person that HAD to help around the house regardless of my studies. 

I am also the only girl in the family of a ""traditional"" family meaning I can't go out or be out late and I have to study in the field that my parents want. Never being able to make decisions for myself and never having nor was allow to have privacy.

Recently my mom passed and I was burden with the mom load. I wasn't able to fully grieve my moms death as I was the one who had to take care of everything. So it's been hard. 

Because of this my dad became the only parents. The parent that annoys me is that my brother 18M is allowed to do anything he wants without punishment, he has a girlfriend and goes out late with no other responsibilities. While I on the other hand am still not allowed out late and I have to take care of them and the house. 

On top of that my dad takes he's anger out on me. Talking to me in ways that are unacceptable. Even if he is grieving, you should never talk to your child like that and restrict them from seeing her extended family. 

Both my dad and brother are financially and emotionally dependent on me and I'm tired of it. But I have guilt moving out so soon after my moms death being in an Asian family where everything in centred around family and me moving out means I might lose my family and them being mad at me. 

I need a 3rd party unbiased opinion if things the right thing. 

So I'm I the asshole for moving out months after my moms death?

59,1feajjw,AITA for telling my MIL she made her bed so lay in it?,"My husband and I are in our early 30s, married for a few years but together for 11. Throughout this time we often argued due to my ILs behavior but specifically MIL. There are many examples I could make, but to sum it up she has been controlling not only to my husband but also me, even going as far as pressuring my husband to make me do what she wanted regarding situations that didn't concern her at all, disrespectful towards me, overall invasive and demanding. You name it. The only thing she has not done is directly insult me to my face.

I kept telling my husband I was over their behavior and to put a stop to it, but he never really acted decisively so MIL never really stopped.

Time after time I would put up a happy front and bite my tongue not to cause drama, but because everything just keeps piling up I'm always on the verge of blowing up whenever I'm around them. I told my husband I'd like to limit contact at least for a while but he insists we go visit. My husband is also aware of much I'm affected by this.

Anyway we meet up and MIL starts with her usual antics, I stay quiet until I've had enough and start talking back to her. I did not insult her but I wouldn't let anything slide like I usually do and highlighted every inappropriate or invasive comment. She is surprised and asks me what came onto me, I never acted like this, and so on. In a fit of rage (I wasn't yelling and I spoke calmly and slowly, but my emotional state was crystal clear, you couldn't mistake it for a lighthearted remark) I told her she's been disrespecting me for years and this is what she's getting now, and she made her bed so she should just lay in it.

Things got tense and we left. I'm upset but finally feel liberated for standing up for myself, husband seems torn, MIL is obviously livid. Husband has now said that he agrees and understands my emotional state on the matter but also wants to keep the peace and to just apologize.

I refused and said I would only be open to revisit the relationship if I see some change and effort to at least be cordial and mutually respectful and I absolutely will not apologize for anything I said because I mean it and would do it again. I reminded him that he had many chances to stand up to them and that I also said no one involved would enjoy it if I had to stand up for myself, and he never took me seriously. I also said I never insulted her or yelled at her, so apologizing for my reaction to her comments sounds incredibly backwards.

I noticed the car and said “sorry!” as I quickly crossed so the car could pass. 

At that moment, a guy leaving the gym shouted “HEY!” and continued to berate me for being on my phone and + not fully paying attention while using the crosswalk. He went into a rant about how more people die in these situations from being on their cell phones than any other way (or something like that). 

The reason I’m posting is because I do see his point—had BOTH me and the driver been inattentive, I could have been hurt. But as a pedestrian, does this stranger have a right to tell me when I can’t be on my phone, if I’m safely using a designated crosswalk (not even a busy street)?

He likes to have control of remote most of the time & put on a movie to start that we had seen before & was really hard for me to watch. I don’t like violence & mind-fu¢k content & thus had both. I put my headphones on & was listening to music & when songs come on I like I will hum or sing along

So 9:00 comes & I take headphones off & he’s like “just so you know, you were singing so loud I needed to keep turning the volume up”.  I was like oh, thanks for telling me, I didn’t notice any hand motions or tap to get my attention”. He got that sheepish look of hand in cookie jar & also doesn’t like getting called in like that because he doesn’t have the self awareness of when he’s being a jerk. 

I then said I felt hurt that I expressed I found that movie disturbing & he chose to watch anyway instead of asking if there was another & found the turning up the volume instead of directly talking was passive aggressive & childish.

(Knowing his history it was his way of showing his feelings of mad/disappointnent & watching the debate which he wasn’t interested in in, though I said a few days ago I was so he could make other plans).

I use to live half and half mostly with my mom because of situations with my stepmom until my mom moved.  To start I work full time at the hospital and have a part time job I work weekends at. I like to work and keep myself busy and because of past incidents I like to be away from home as much as possible. When I am home tho I always clean up after myself they never have to pick up after me and they don’t pay for anything for me and have made it clear that I have a full time job and can pay myself, which i have no problem with. 

When they ask for help around the house (keep in mind im barley home and im very busy) so i can’t always complete these tasks right away but i do get them done. 

Recently we’ve all been getting into arguments about how i don’t just do stuff without them asking such as vacuuming or cleaning the bathrooms ect. I’ve told them multiple times i have no issues doing these things they just have to ask and i’ll get to it as soon as i can, because im not aware of what needs to be done around the house. My brother has absolutely no chores around the house and runs around playing video games all the time. (meanwhile when i was 10 i was doing all the same chores i do now). Also recently everytime I don’t do something they want they threaten me with paying rent when they’ve clearly said to me “We would never make you pay rent” Now my stepmother has reached out to me (rudely) expressing how we need a family meeting to communicate (which I agree) but then she goes and messages me “Come prepared for the conversation please. Google adult working children moving back home and jot down any questions you have for us please.” Once I googled it, it basically says; “Start by setting a realistic expiration date on their time at home based on their job situation. Next, make it clear that you're not their cook, laundress or maid. Finally, ask them to pay rent regardless of whether you need the money or not.” 

I found that that very rude considering the fact that they indeed do NOT get me groceries they do NOT feed me nor make me dinners or anything, nor do they do my laundry or anything…. It’s clear that I have no curfew cause “i own my own car and come and go as i please” Therefore it looks like they are just wanting me to pay rent.

65,1fe8tk1,AITA: Fiance is a realtor. Should she receive commission for a house our parents help us buy?,"My fiance (29f) and I (30m) are buying a house. It is very expensive to buy a house where we live in Cali and are extremely fortunate and blessed that our parents are going to be helping us out significantly. To put it into perspective, our parents collectively are giving us 20x what each of us are contributing financially. Both sets of parents contributing equally. 

My fiancé is a realtor and is acting as our buying agent/realtor to buy the house. However, she feels like she should be paid her commission on this deal. I have a hard time understanding her perspective for this. I respect that there is a lot of work and other overhead costs associated with being a realtor, however we’re getting a house out of this. Should she be compensated above what is already being given to us?

My parents feel strongly against her taking a commission. Her parents suggested to her she take some amount of commission, even if it’s 25% of what she would normally take. I initially supported her in this because she felt so strongly about being paid a commission. However deep down in my gut I feel like it’s wrong. It’s essentially our parents money that is buying us a house, I feel like taking a commission is asking to make money off of what we’re already being given. 

We agreed that instead she would reduce our offer by the amount of her commission and essentially remove it from the deal, so no commission is being paid and we are paying less for the house. However she is unhappy about this and is holding it against me. AITAH for this? Please give me your honest opinions. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA: Fiance is a realtor.

67,1fe7ocv,AITA for calling my grandmother sexist?,"On mobile and new to reddit, sorry for anything weird.

Essentially, in early August, I (16F) went back to school shopping with my grandmother for myself and my younger brother (9M)

I was put in charge of getting his stuff to start, since I had the list, and she had to return something she ordered online.

Now, my brother's favorite color is lavender, and I found a binder that was the size of what he needed in that color. (It was more pink, but I knew that he would like it.)

I put it into the cart and my grandmother returns and stares at it, before saying something about it being 'pink' and for a boy.

I called her sexist and shut down her complaints about him being bullied, because I would rather get him something he likes than worry about the kids in his class (his friends) bullying him. Her main points were that kids are cruel, and that he's a boy and people will tease him for that.

I had to mention that he's told me he's popular and friends with his class, and up to now there's been no issue.

Except one. I have an uncle who lives out of state, unlike the rest of this side of my family. And he tends to gossip with my grandmother. (They tend to shittalk my uncle's family and my mom's family -- me and my siblings.)

I heard recently from my cousin that my uncle has been up in her face about this because of my grandmother telling him this, telling her that I'm an asshole for standing up for her when she was looking out for my brother and that I shouldn't have gotten him a pink binder.

And now I'm starting to feel bad because this spread to other members of my family when I didn't mean for it to.

68,1fe7ek4,AITA for wanting bf to wait for me after he offered,"My bf and I started dating about 3 months ago, and I recently found out that I am pregnant. My bf is originally from DR and he has two children there. He visits them every few months until he is able to bring them here. When we started dating, he told me he had a trip planned for this month (September) but he preferred to cancel it and wait for me to get my passport in order to go with him, as I have never been to his country. (I never asked him to cancel or wait for me to go) I agreed to go with him and I was excited about it. I paid extra to have my passport expedited. One day in July I asked him if he had canceled his trip in the app and he frustrated, responded “no, I didn’t cancel it yet, my sister needs to cancel it for me. But if I tell you I am not going, I am not going. I told you I’m waiting for you. You need to believe my word” He then started to hold this over my head and time we had minor disagreements.

Any time we had arguments he would say “I am going to go without you” knowing that I did not yet have my passport & the new plan he constructed was to go in November/December together. I would then get upset because 1) I spent $240 to get an expedited passport that I am still waiting on and 2) it was never my idea in the first place. After I’d voice frustration with him for flip flopping constantly, he would get angry and say “ I had these plans before you” to which I would respond “I understand that, I never asked you to change your plan. This was your idea and you offered. Now I paid $240 for no reason.” Then he would say “ok, I will not go without you. I will wait” …..until the next time we have a disagreement about something unrelated, he’d start all over and bring it up again. This has happened about 4-5 times.

The trip is this week and he never canceled it. He is starting to fight with me again. He is telling me he wants to go after we had an argument two days ago about something irrelevant. I am frustrated because 1) I paid extra money/money at all that I would not have if he did not ask me to get my passport to go with him in Nov/Dec (I live alone & pay rent by myself and don’t like to spend unnecessary money as it’s not easy.) 2) he told me I need to believe his word, I did believe him, and then he has changed said word back and forth 4-5 times. This makes me feel like his word is less credible and I’m going to have a difficult time believing him with stuff in the future. 3) this was never even my idea. If he had kept his mouth shut and kept his trip as it was at the beginning of our relationship- this wouldn’t even be an issue with me right now. 

I have been very sick & tired during first trimester and the last thing I want to do is fight with him, especially over the same issue multiple times.

69,1fe78t9,AITA for telling my parents I am spending my last Christmas as an ‘unmarried woman’ with my fiancé’s family instead? ,"Me (F28) and my fiancé (M29) are getting married in February. He usually spends Christmas skiing with his family in France and I’ve been going with him 2 out of every 3 years since we got together. Otherwise, I either spend Christmas with my parents alone or he stays and celebrates with me and my family (I am an only child). My parents don’t spend Christmas with other family because they all live in another country.

Last year, I spent Christmas with my fiancé’s family. When I told my parents I wasn’t going to be home for Christmas this year either, my mother was devastated and said she wanted me home for my last Christmas as an unmarried woman and thought it was appropriate for me and my fiancé to spend it apart before our wedding in Feb. My parents are very traditional and view my marriage as ‘giving me away’ and don’t expect me to go home very often after I get married. We are also considering a move to France next year. 

The reason for me not wanting to go home is two-fold. 1) My parents do not let my fiancé stay overnight in their house, even in a guest bedroom. While we live close to my parents’ house, it feels hostile to kick him out after dinner on Christmas Day (they want me to stay the night at home with them). 2) I will be finishing my exams for my law degree in December and want to take a nice break away from the country. 

I do see my parents’ point of view too. I am an only child, I am always busy so never go home anyway, my parents marriage is crumbling and apparently I am the only person keeping it together and we also have 2 very old cats I am incredibly close with that likely won’t last longer past Christmas so it would be nice to spend one last Christmas with them. However, my parents are very controlling, make up so many rules for the house every time we meet them and they aren’t particularly fun to hang out with. 

On the other hand, my fiancé’s family are extremely welcoming, he has many siblings so Christmas is always so warm and fuzzy with lots of children and music and his father is also a lawyer so we have a lot to talk about. I also love to ski and think it would be a nice way to cool off after my law degree. I can’t spend Christmas here and travel to France for New Year’s because the schedules don’t add up and the travel time will be too long. My fiancé will need to be back for work on the 2nd of January.

we set off for the trip in his car. during the ride I noticed that his wife kept canceling the north plans and I was pissed because that was the whole reason I agreed to go.
we first arrived at her wife's parents' house. I was really uncomfortable there because I didn't know these people and they were not MY family, they also primarily spoke Turkish so I coul dn't understand a word they were saying.

74,1fe66e2,AITA for spotting a girl at the gym while my gf was there?,"

I am 20, my gf is 23, and we started dating this 5 months ago. We usually work out together, but she was running late from class, so I started without her. While there, I noticed a girl struggling with her squat form as her knees were bending in unevenly, and her back wasn’t straight, so I gave her a tip to avoid injury. After that, I went back to my routine.


A few minutes later, she asked me to spot her for a heavy set. Since the gym was literally empty other than us, I agreed, thinking it was just common sense to help someone lifting heavy. I was standing pretty close to her to make sure she wouldn’t get hurt, and we ended up chatting a little after the set. I made a few jokes about her form, which made her laugh, but I didn’t think much of it as it felt like a normal gym interaction.


However, my gf arrived right at the time, and saw us like that. She didn’t say anything at the time, but later, she was really upset. She told me it looked like I was being too friendly and that helping her with her form and spotting her like that when she wasn’t there crossed a line. She also said I shouldn’t be that close to another girl in the gym, especially while joking around.

Though the post has been deleted my colleague screenshot it because she thought it sounded familiar.

In the comments she remarked the OP has also made snickering comments on my child names. With people cheering her on. We dugged a little further and I could confirm it was my cousin profile. From her interest to her pictures post.

Me and my husband confronted her about it and she said majority agreed with her that it was a stupid and horrendous name.  She also said it didn’t matter that it was a cultural name since my husband can’t speak and isn’t even involved in the culture. My husband was livid and we decided to kick her out.

She has since blasted us on Facebook and family group chat to kick her out in a foreign city and since she was jobless and we are setting our son up for failure with names like that.

76,1fe5j7h,AITA for telling my friend that her dog is badly behaved?,"
So I (25F) have a friend (24F) I've known since high school. She wanted to move back to London and I wanted to try living in a new city so we agreed to live together. She has a little 3 year old dog that was going to be living with us, who my friend has had since she was a puppy. She'd always been a little bit naughty but I didn't think much of it. 

We start living together and that's when I found out how little this dog was actually trained. She would pee and poop on the floor daily, steal food off our plates, bark all day, she wasn't crate trained, she would steal anything small enough to get in her mouth and destroy it or if you would try to get it back she would growl and snap at you. Sometimes she would bite you just for sitting next to her. 

I would tell her this behavior was really upsetting for me and made me feel unsafe in my home but she wouldn't ever really listen. I would make passive aggressive jokes about the situation to try and cope, which admittedly wasn't helpful of me and we'd have a lot of discussions about that which I did apologise for. She did a lot of other stuff like coming into my room and using my stuff and getting drunk and shitty with me that eventually made me move out. I was also miserable in my job and ended up moving out of London but the roommate situation was a big factor.

Now I'm living back in my hometown while I sort my mental health out and I've seen her on a few occasions where she seemed to act without much consideration for me or anyone else. For example on my birthday holiday to Italy I was having problems with my mobility (I have trouble walking sometimes) and she refused to slow down the entire time, even when I asked her directly. She also brought her dog on a different trip and she was horribly behaved the entire time. She said she behaved very well to which I politely disagreed. 

So after the holiday and a couple of other trips she eventually asks to meet in person. She says she's unhappy with the way I've been speaking to her, like being snappy with her on our Italy holiday. I tell her if I've been snappy it's because she's done something to warrant me being upset. She also tells me she doesn't like that I say her dog is badly behaved. I say that perhaps not everyone is uncomfortable with the kind of behavior her dog displays but I think that anyone would agree she is poorly trained. She got angry and said some hurtful things that I won't get into on here, and I said it would probably be for the best that we didn't stay friends. 

This has really been bothering me and I need to know if I've been an asshole in this situation? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for telling my friend that her dog is badly behaved?

Despite no changes since then, Sharon recently demanded it be fixed because they think it'll ""fall over any day now.""

Sharon had a landscaper that was already doing a job for them, and she said the he can fix the fence as well. He couldn't speak English so Sharon translated but I didn't really understand what they were going to do. All I got was that they were going to use concrete on the posts. I told them I also knew a builder and I'll get him to have a look.

My guy came and thought that it's better to rebuild. He estimated the cost of materials would be about $1k, then we can negotiate labor costs a bit. I told Sharon the next day, and she waved it off, saying her guy could do it for ""like $500."" He was coming back after the weekend, and so I waited for a proper quote.

Over a week later, Sharon texted to say that the work was done, the price was $600, and asked me to send her $300. She never gave me a proper quote. I told her I'm happy to split the costs, but asked for an invoice and a description of the work done. She said that it was a cash job, and ""I thought you were my neighbor so you can give the money whenever you're free."" I reiterated that because this concerns my property, I need a record of work done and payments, but she again said that because it was a cash-only job, that there won't be an official invoice. I also asked about warranty, and she said it would be 12 months.

Later, I had a look at what was actually done. I just saw two temporary wooden posts supporting the fence. The guy probably dug around the problem fence post and poured some concrete around it to fix the fence post in place. It did not look like a $600 job.

I ignored her for a week while seeking advice from my local community center, who said that costs of repairing a fence on a boundary are shared by the properties concerned, and that I am within my rights to ask for proof of work done.

I told Sharon that I was very unhappy with how she had gone about things. That if dealing with a neighbor, there is a responsibility to make things proper and keep official records. I told her that I cannot make any payment comfortably until I get that invoice.

My main concern is that Sharon might be getting us to pay more. Sharon and Will look to be in their late 40s/50s, and we're in our late 20s, so they might think we're easy targets.

I am more independent, cautious, and a perfectionist. I've had jobs ever since I could remember to afford things I wanted, I made sure to get the best grades and participate in every extracurricular activity possible to have a great resume and apply to my dream school with all the scholarships available, in which I got in. My brother (24M) is the complete opposite, being more laidback and careless with everything he does. Because of this, when he was in college for a year and a half, he decided he didn't want to be in that school and dropped out losing all his credits and basically starting over. My parents are going through difficult times financially and because of that, they asked me to leave school in the meantime until my brother graduates. I wished it didn't make me as furious as it has because things like these happen, but it made me feel like I did everything right only for it to be taken away. Currently I'm working two jobs in order to get experience before going back to school and to save money to afford tuition.

Today, my brother kept complaining about having to go back to school and it just made me feel sick. He said ""You have it so easy staying home"" to which I lost it. I know he might not have had that intention but I was furious. I started telling him how obnoxious and rude he was being and how insensitive he was for saying things like that knowing how badly I wanted to go back to school. He was offended and started saying that I was being dramatic and to get over it since I was already taking it easy by not taking classes. I straight up told him the reason I wasn't taking any classes was because he couldn't decide what to do with his life and when he finally decided it affected both my parents and me. My mom stopped me and told me to calm down which only made me feel worse, but I stopped talking and came up to my room. 

I don't know if I went too far by saying those things in front of my parents but I was tired of how insensitive and rude my brother was being. I've feel like this for a while and the fact he gets to go to school makes me feel jealous ngl. I hate feeling like this but I think he went over the line.

AITA?

EDIT: After reading some comments I thought it'd be good to clarify some things. While I did get accepted to my dream school and I got scholarships, I didn't get a full ride. All my scholarships together cover about 50% of my tuition but it's still expensive. I work a 9-5 office job as a graphic designer and a part-time job at a bakery back home during the weekends. I've also worked side hustles like art commissions and so since I'm pursuing a career as a graphic designer. With that I've been able to afford taking about 1-2 online classes every semester. I've applied for additional scholarships but unfortunately I don't end up qualifying for most of them because I'm not American and/or because I'm already 22. This also being why I haven't applied for student loans either.

When I graduated high school it was on March 2020 and well we know how that year went, so money was very tight. I've been able to do some progress with my online classes in college back then until 2021 when I got my Associate's Degree and transferred to my dream school in 2022. That was also the year my brother dropped out of college and applied to his current school. We practically ended up going to school at the same time but me as a transfer student, and him as a first year.

From my understanding, his classes were never transferred to his current school so he started as a freshman at 22. However, I'm not sure if there were any credits his school could've taken because he didn't do the research and applied as a first year student anyways. 

My brother has never had a job, never applied to one in the first place. The one experience he's gotten is an internship he did for about 3 months at the beginning of this year, but it was unpaid and somehow my parents ended up sending him money for gas, food, etc. every week which he spent immediately and kept asking not only them, but me for additional money. Whenever I've asked for money or even mention my tuition, my parents get really stressed or frustrated, giving the same reasons every time about how money is tight and that I need to be more understanding. 

I can understand that our financial situation is not great so I need to work harder, what I can't wrap my head around is the fact that while I have to be understanding, my brother gets to do whatever he wants and ask for money whenever he wants.

When I bring up any topics about how unfair it is that he doesn't pay for anything and that he doesn't want to pay for anything, my mom always says ""He doesn't work yet, unlike you, how is he going to pay for anything?"" which baffles me every single time. Every time I bring up that I'm upset or that I need to say something about it I've gotten shut down, I've been told that they don't want to hear me or my complaints and go back to the tangent of how things are bad right now and again that I need to be understanding.

I truly feel bad for even thinking these thoughts, but I don't even know how it is possible for someone to be so ungrateful for something I wish I could have when we live under the same roof. He's about to leave for school again this weekend 

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for calling my brother out in front of our parents for complaining about school? I (22F) don't have the best relationship with my brother. I am more independent, cautious, and a perfectionist.

My brother (24M) is the complete opposite, being more laidback and careless with everything he does. Because of this, when he was in college for a year and a half, he decided he didn't want to be in that school and dropped out losing all his credits and basically starting over. My parents are going through difficult times financially and because of that, they asked me to leave school in the meantime until my brother graduates.

81,1fe3uod,AITA for declining my best friends call? ,"So I want to provide some back story for everyone before I start. This is about a friend (F19) and I (also F19). 
Recently we’ve been apart due to moving back to campus so up until last week calls have been infrequent and short.
I have been feeling a little hurt because it has only been me checking in on her and sending things first, but anytime I feel that I am overbearing and pull back to give space  she will randomly mention she wishes I would text more because she’s too busy and forgets, but then will never seem interested and only ever talks long enough to tell me what’s going on with HER. Although I am still a little sad that is just life and I 1000% understand that she is probably just getting used to being back in classes and away from home again. 
Last week we finally got to call and BOTH talk. I was on my way to my car after a class and saw she had sent a tiktok earlier in the day so I decided to call her as I drove home. She had told me before that her roommate wasn’t in the room on certain days days and to call her at those times if i could. That day was one of those times so i texted asking if she was busy. At the beginning of the call she’d randomly mentioned how she loved the alone time she got to work when her roommate was gone so I assumed she was alone at this time.  After checking in on her and learning about her new classes she asks me how things have been for me. I told her my classes had been good and we just continued catching up. I can’t recall everything said as It was a 40 minute call but at one point I was very vulnerable talking about a situation that had happened a week prior with my ex and some family issues going on. I don’t love talking about those situations and would honestly now be slightly embarrassed if others heard how upset i was. 
By the end of the conversation I ask her how her new roommate was and that’s when I began to hear laughs. She had told me to say hi and  informed me that she had been there the whole conversation and was listening in to everything I had said previously. I laughed slightly saying “oh you should have told me I’m sorry, I thought you’d said you were alone” she responds by telling me she had forgotten to mention it and laughs again telling me not to worry her roommate found it funny and interesting? I think I would have ignored this had part of the conversation not been so vulnerable. It felt like an invasion of privacy in a way. After saying our goodbyes and hanging up I was feeling confused.  I understand it’s a dorm room and it would have never been 100% private but having me on speaker and putting me on blast for her roommate to hear honestly left me feeling strange. It’s not like the conversations were awful just something I usually would only share with close friends. I haven’t said anything about it and am not sure if I should. She called me today but I was walking to class so I declined and have yet to call back, despite her asks of why. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-11,"AITA for declining my best friends call?

I’m on the phone with my family discussing about one bedroom or studio apartments in Silver Spring so that way I’m also closer to work and reducing my cost. (Mind you the only reason I’m still living in DC is because she was finishing school.) Then randomly on the phone, my aunt goes oh well well your sister  got a job so you have to move Chevy chase, MD. I said what do you mean? My sister literally walked past me multiple times didn’t say anything. ( she didn’t even tell me until  4 hours later at 10pm I am one living with her) I said well I’m not living in Chevy because it’s expensive. I had been apartment hunting already for Studios and one bedrooms because she was leaving & the lease ends next month. my aunt goes well money doesn’t matter. When my aunt is first one to throw it back in my face & won’t say anything to sister. I said well I’m not going to do that need to get separate housing so she understands what bills need to split  because I currently take on almost all of the bills and she provides no money towards bills she only ask you guys for rent money and then purposely does this thing where she says oh I can’t help you with but orders food everyday. I explained we need to live somewhere within my means and Silver Spring she can take the train/bus to Chevy Chase(maybe 20-30 minutes). Plus the apartment I’m looking at is brand new and the prices. My aunt and mom then brought up her pay of $20 an hour 40 hours a week  oh it’s $3200 a month. I’m like that’s before taxes she’s not gonna have any money to even afford anything in Chevy Chase. Then they continued to go back-and-forth with me and I said I will apply to Silver Spring by myself, but I’m not moving to Chevy Chase & they got mad at me and said I was being selfish. She literally doesnt help clean and does petty stuff It’s very stressful and I feel like I’m at my breaking point. I am being selfish AITA ",0.0,-0.0044891424,0,1
87,1fe2ezs,AITA? Sending Fags to FIL and family mad at me,"AITA 
I 
send my financially struggling pensioner FIL chop shop ciggies once a month that saves him a lot of money. Sure he could quit but has stated he never will. AITA for saving him $400 a month at least?

For context no one in the family wants him to smoke, he’s tried to give up many times but just can’t do it. He’s got a few health issues but has gone from having a lot in life to lots of heartache topped off by living in a council unit at age 78 for the first time in his life.
I feel it’s his right to still choose to smoke even if it’s pissing most of his family off. 
Anyways I just got a text from other BIL (not FIL’s Son) saying to stop sending fags as I’m enabling him.
So what do you all think? Can add more context if needed.

Maybe it was my tone of voice or something, but appearantly somethimg about how I phrased it ticked him off.

""Everyone wakes me up from my sleep"" was what he said. And I totally get that, I am at fault for that. I had a panic attack and needed someone to talk about this.

He just dropped ""I put an Alarm for 7"" indicating I should only after 7 talk with him about things I am scared about and that stress me. He also went back to sleep without another word to me.

So the question is, AITA for wanting to speak about the things that had me have an panic attack? (I dont even know how to phrase the question)

91,1fe1fk1,AITA for refusing to pay more rent???,"AITA??

My partner and I moved into a sharehouse earlier this year with 2 other people who already lived there. Myself and my partner moved into one room, which we pay $700p/week for between the two of us ($350 each). The others pay $500 each for their rooms individually. We never hit it off with the others and had some minor issues, our things going missing, etc. Never anything too serious, but enough that we never got past the “just housemates” relationship. A few weeks ago one of my housemates (Call her Beth) told us she was going to rehab for 12 weeks. Do what you need to do. We asked if she would still be able to afford rent and she said yes, so no dramas. 

A few weeks in she messaged and asked us if we were able to cover part of her rent as she’s struggling financially while in rehab. However, she only asked my partner and I to cover this, not the other housemate. I was confused as to why it was just the two of us being asked and not our other housemate, and didn’t understand if this was her asking as a favour or because she believes we should be paying more. I talked to my other housemate about this and whether she knew the reason why she wasn’t being asked and she said it was a conversation Beth brought up but she wasn’t sure. 

The next day we received a very hostile message from Beth about us talking behind her back, telling us we had been done a favour by being able to live in a place where we can have mates over, be ourselves, etc. and that we already aren’t paying enough for the room. I have always seen sharehouses as “you pay for the room” and therefore see our pay as already significantly higher than theirs, despite it being cheaper as individuals, because we share the one space. Beth sees it as we are paying as individuals and therefore we are not paying enough. In the message she sent, she insisted that we pay the new amount of rent (with the increase she had asked for) otherwise she would get “fairwork” involved (I didnt know how to tell her fairwork is the wrong organisation for this issue) 

My partner and I do not want to be paying extra rent because we have been forced into it through threats and are planning on refusing. I think, although as individuals we pay less, our room is still significantly pricier than theirs and told them they are welcome to get a roommate to make their rent cheaper.

92,1fe1dy3,AITA for stepping on documents on the floorboard of a car because I forgot they were there? ,"Hi Folks,


To preface, I don't have a car. My partner does. When we are going to the same place, they will pick me up with my assigned seat being shotgun.


Recently, they picked me up to run an errand and grab dinner. At some level, I noticed something on the floor that looked like paper but couldn't see the details and didn't think to ask about it, just did my best to avoid stepping on it. We ran the errand, dropped something off at my place, then headed out to dinner. 


On the way, they asked ""what's that you're stepping all over?"" I said I wasn't sure, looked like some kind of paper. Handed it to them and they said it was from their doc and in the future if I noticed something on the floor or in the seat, I should move it or ask them about it and not risk stepping on it. I said I'd do my best, but I couldn't promise to be successful and I would appreciate it if they would endeavor to not let things end up in the seat/floor in the first place. They said they'd forgotten to take it inside when they went home after their appointment, but that I bore the majority of the responsibility for it getting stepped on. This turned into a conflict with them repeatedly reiterating that I needed to move items on the floor or in the seat and me saying I'd do my best but that I would appreciate it if they would do their best to ensure items didn't end up in my seat or my floorboard when they knew I'd be sitting there. They did not acknowledge my request. They turned around at the restaurant and took me back to my place, with the conflict continuing throughout, culminating in them telling me to ""Get out of [their] car.""


The next day, they brought it up again and clarified that if I had just apologized for stepping on the document at first, there would have been no conflict. I told them they had not made that clear to me and said that I did not want to revisit the conversation out of therapy.


Today we had our therapy appointment. Our therapist had us discuss emotions then roleplay the initial conversation, and my partner in their first response acknowledged my request and said they'd do their best but indicated that they still felt it was primarily my fault that the paper got stepped on. I asked them to clarify on our way out, and they said that, while they felt they had missed their responsibility to take care of their own documents, they still felt that >50% of the responsibility for the docs getting stepped on was on me and that by not accepting that, I was in gross breach of etiquette. I feel that I showed the same level of care for the documents that my partner had, and any resulting damage would primarily be due to their initial actions

93,1fe13oa,AITA For Continuing NC with my Dying Mother,"**Prologue**

I (40’s) and my wife (a bit younger) have a young child. I have a younger (a few years) sister who is married with a family.

I have a bad relationship with my parents (80’s), but especially my mom. She favors my sister and women in a way that is unhealthy. She has told relatives that they can only trust women because if your boy has a wife, you can’t be sure that the child is your blood. She had an idiot only brother who squandered the family wealth. Prior generation were Asians who thought only boys matter.

**Personal Examples**

Each of these could individually be an AITA post to justify LC/NC:

My sister and I went to a local private school, but, I was sent to the boarding school whereas my sister stayed at home.

My mother lent my sister $100k’s for school. I couldn’t get her to lend me $3k for school.

When my kid was born, she would regularly visit sister’s family (even though she lived much further away) and pay for airfare whereas she insisted I pay when visiting me. This was consistent for groceries, meals out etc.

Said they could no longer babysit for me (but still could for my sister) because my child was too old (sister’s kid is older).

During covid, they kidnapped my kid (who was staying at my in-laws). They sent me pictures of feeding my kid and laughing saying “Does this look like kidnapping?” When I asked why they took my kid without my permission they answered “because we knew you’d say no”.

**The Cycle**

In the past, when they would do something that was just too much, I would go LC for a period but eventually we would reset our relationship. I tried to have an honest chat with my dad:

“Dad, we keep fighting – this isn’t working. I feel like I’m a teenager even though I’m in my \[20’s, 30’s\]. Every time you just act like everything is normal and eventually, we start talking again. Nothing changes.”

… But more recently, I also added:

“Every time this happens, the recovery gets longer and longer. One day, the recovery will last longer that the time you have left.”

**The Straw**

The day finally came. We argued and my dad dropped a favorite line of his: “You are my favorite son”. I told him “Please stop saying that. It couldn’t be more painfully clear to me that you and mum favor my sister.” “No, I love you both equally.”

I just lost it and hung up on him. My wife and I had a discussion about going NC. My wife ultimately deferred to me, saying “they are your parents”.

I decided to go NC – knowing that someday they would pass away.

**The Question**

So now the Day seems to be fast approaching: My mother has cancer and is in palliative care.

I take some guidance from one of Neil Brennan’s Netflix special, 3 Mics: “Everyone I know that had an ill parent was, like, dude, you gotta make it right with him. I’m telling you, if you don’t, you’re really going to regret it.”

My dad never wanted to be buried. He told us he never wanted an expensive funeral because we’re poor. We would follow his wishes and cremate him. 



My titi Rita pointed at every single one of the kids and asked, “How much is each of his kids contributing?” And that rubbed us all of the wrong way. Nate said, “It’s not about the money, I’ll pay for the whole thing.” And then Rita backtracked, “Oh, Nate has a life, he shouldn’t have to pay for it all.”Siblings and I all say we would pay for the funeral costs. My mom didn’t have the money which is fine. Titi Rosa, the only one that didn’t go after my mom and gets treated like us by her sisters (the titis) helped us make a gofundme but the money wouldn’t have gotten to us in time, so we plan to reimburse ourselves with however much we end up raising. If there is any money left over, it’s going into a savings account for our youngest brothers (14&15). The other 3 titis said they would handle refreshments and the obituary. 

The next day, my mom says we’re doing a burial because the 3 titis called her and texted her making her feel bad, basically bullying her into agreeing to a burial somehow convincing her to get 6 death certificates so that “all of his sisters can have one for memories.” 



I said no, we’re doing the cremation and maybe THEY can bury their share of ashes with grandma if that’s what they want. I made sure to let my mom know that if they wanted an urn, they needed to buy one for themselves. 

They said no to an urn but yesterday said they thought THEY would be getting the urn that I bought.



Yesterday at the viewing, titi Sara told her pastor that SHE paid for half of the funeral, and the rest was paid by Nate and accepts envelopes that were supposed to go to us since we paid for it. My mom said she could keep it if she needed the money so badly.



Also, I had to put an obituary together AT THE FUNERAL HOME because they didn’t do it and they got my cousin to do the refreshments.

I told my mom not to tell them when the cremation is and that they don’t get the certificates or ashes. Don’t get me wrong, I understand that they’re hurting too.

95,1fe0o7e,"AITA for snapping at my coworker who told me I'm ""not Asian enough"" after I said that I didn't love math","I (17F Asian) recently had a fight with my coworker 'Ari' (22F white). We haven't had any issues until this incident.

Yesterday she was asking what courses I'm taking (I just started college) and when I told her, calculus was one of the courses. Ari said she expected that. I raised my eyebrow and I asked ""what do you mean by that."" I already knew where this was going but I wanted to see what she would say next. She said that well, Asians always love math. I sighed and told her that I don't LOVE math but my major (public health) requires me to take it, so I'm taking it early on just so I won't have to do it later. I tried to joke about it by saying that I'm really not a math person.

She said ""seriously? You're not Asian enough!"" in a joking tone that annoyed me. I know it was a joke but this hit hard since I've experienced comments like this before from people if I didn't conform to what they thought of asian people (ex. someone told me I wasn't ""a real Korean"" because I don't like kimchi) and while I get that it's not really that serious compared to other situations people face, it gets really annoying after a while.

I told her that I am very much Asian and she can see my birth certificate if she doesn't believe it. I didn't yell but said this in a really rude tone. and I ignored her apology. When she tried to talk with me about work stuff I would respond curtly.

Half of me feels justified because I am so tired of this stereotype. The other half feels bad because I don't like getting mad at people and causing a big scene when it could have been avoided. I feel like I'm the one who escalated the conversation in the first place. honestly I don't know anymore.

Aita? I accept being called an asshole (that is what I came for), but I've seen how hostile people can be on this sub. Please call me out on what I did but please don't be excessively hostile, call me swears, etc.

edit: About the apology: I could tell she knew I got upset and she did look remorseful, but the apology itself was a little awkward. She quietly said ""Oh. I'm sorry for saying that"" and looked down. I think she was sincere but didn't know how to express it in that moment

edit 2: Part of the reason I reacted the way I did was because I didn't feel our relationship was close enough for her to be making jokes like that. Ari and I are friendly, but I wouldn't call us friends. If it was a good friend of mine saying this, I think I could have let it slide, but I only know her on a very superficial level and didn't think we were close enough for her to just pull that out of nowhere.

Here’s the quick back story: We’ve been together for a full decade, and she has been AWFUL to me. I’ve avoided seeing them (his parents) for about a year b/c our last meeting (right before the engagement) she compared me to the scum of the Earth, passively, when her son was out of the house with his dad (my future FIL/68).

I don’t wanna get into too much detail and explain the decades worth of trauma she’s contributed in my life, but let’s just say we’re taking about a clinically narcissistic individual who hates other women being in her sons life. Any time we tried to bond in the past it would turn into an opportunity for her to be UNHINGED towards me. And after her back handed comments towards me the last time we “bonded”, I set boundaries and said I’m done trying. Now, I’ve said it frequently, but even my therapist was like, “at what point will enough be enough for you?”. I feel defeated. I TRIED for YEARS.

He hasn’t told her my answer is no b/c he wants me to think about it from the perspective of being a future daughter in law. We’ve known for YEARS that we were end game, but wanted to wait until we felt financially ready to make the jump into marriage. He has had COUNTLESS conversations with her about respecting me as a person and respecting his relationship with me (she would frequently bring up his exes when I’m not around in hopes he’d leave me for one of them).
All of my previous exes mothers have loved me. I’ve even been asked by 1 exes mom if I would ever consider taking her “stupid” son back.

As a people pleaser/hopeful individual, deep down I want to try but I’m too old and I told him there’s no repairing this unless it’s with an apology. I want that before anymore “bonding gone wrong” experiences happen with this woman. I accepted she’ll never see me as family but as a weird “other woman” b/c she’s got a weird dynamic going on in her head. My fiancée really thinks I’m being unreasonable by saying no.

98,1fe0cum,"AITA A Customer left their phone for hours, so I opened it and messaged a contact to get ahold of her","Edit: wow that's a lot of people. thank you for everyones input.  something that come up multiple times: There was no #1 contact and  I had no idea that there is an emergency section called ICE, otherwise I would have utilized those. 

A bit of context: I work retail in a small/medium town. But it's actively growing and there are lots of businesses, and customers often come in with bags from other stores in the plaza. If you lose something,  it's unlikely you'll find it quickly if at all. This is why I was initially comfortable with what I did

A few weeks ago at work,  someone left a very expensive iphone by accident.  After a few hours,  she still did not come back for it so I checked if it was locked.  It did not. So I went to messages,  tapped on the first contact I saw and left a message explaining where I worked,  where the phone was,  and asked them to contact her household about the phone(her lock screen was of her kid so my line of thought was that it was likely she had another adult at home). I did NOT snoop the conversation or anything in the phone. Then it went back into the safe room until she came to claim it.

I thought this was a reasonable thing to do as I've seen that happen in media, although never in real life had I dealt with it. 

She came back in  less than an hour later cussing up a storm and calling me retarded multiple times to my face and to my manager. Turns out her expensive,  unlocked phone was her business phone and I had messaged a client.  My manager did her best to calm her and get her to leave asap bc I was clearly about to cry (I get overwhelmed easily).  My manager made it clear I wasnt in trouble after she left and we moved on. 

Well this happened in front of a customer who was waiting. When I came back to check her out,  she said she heard everything and was appalled at phone lady's reaction. Customer 2 said she would have been grateful in that situation and generally reassured me I shouldn't feel bad. 

When I went home,  I told my mom about it and she basically told me I was dumb to do that but agreed that phone lady was overreacting when I had good intentions. 

I have no idea how to feel about it anymore,  but I probably won't be going out of my way like that again.

100,1fe06cn,AITA for not letting my parents borrow money from me,"For context I'm 23 and i still live with my parents. I am not able to move out currently. 

They have been having frequent on and off gambling periods since i was 14 in high school. Times where they would go from once a week a month to 3-4 days a week. Then randomly go on a break for a couple months or so, then they start up again. Even though they know i know about them going, they still lie about it every now and then.

Recently they have been having money issues and they have been constantly asking me for money to borrow to pay off certain things (they are never entirely specific). It got to the point where i straight up said, i dont want to lend you guys money because you keep lying to me about gambling and keep going during times when you complain about not having much. They denied this of course and said they havent gone recently.

Before i went camping with my boyfriend for a few days, my mom kept asking me for money because she said she really needed it. During this time she also kept constantly bringing up how ""broke she is"" and saying things in a way as if she wanted to guilt trip me into letting her borrow.

So before i left i took my moms phone and shared her location with me on find my phone. I was gone for just 4 days, and guess where they went 2 of those days while i was gone. They spent 6+ hours at the casino both days.. When i got back i asked my mom if they went while i was gone and she said ""how could we go there if we dont have money"" lol

I know they actually have things they need to pay off and arent lying about that, but i feel like if i let them borrow more (ive lent them 10,000 already a month ago and they only paid me back half so far), its just going to enable their bad habit. I also feel a bit like im being manipulated by them because of how much they've tried to gaslight me by saying they arent lying to me + trying to make me feel guilty for accusing them of being liars...

The amount my mom has been asking me for recently is another 1000.

 Im stressed out bcs of course i care and would like to help because its my parents, and im their only kid. But i cant help but think that if i do it'll just allow them to keep acting this way.

Then randomly go on a break for a couple months or so, then they start up again. Even though they know i know about them going, they still lie about it every now and then.

Recently they have been having money issues and they have been constantly asking me for money to borrow to pay off certain things (they are never entirely specific). It got to the point where i straight up said, i dont want to lend you guys money because you keep lying to me about gambling and keep going during times when you complain about not having much. They denied this of course and said they havent gone recently.

Before i went camping with my boyfriend for a few days, my mom kept asking me for money because she said she really needed it. During this time she also kept constantly bringing up how ""broke she is"" and saying things in a way as if she wanted to guilt trip me into letting her borrow.

So before i left i took my moms phone and shared her location with me on find my phone. I was gone for just 4 days, and guess where they went 2 of those days while i was gone. They spent 6+ hours at the casino both days.. When i got back i asked my mom if they went while i was gone and she said ""how could we go there if we dont have money"" lol

I know they actually have things they need to pay off and arent lying about that, but i feel like if i let them borrow more (ive lent them 10,000 already a month ago and they only paid me back half so far), its just going to enable their bad habit. I also feel a bit like im being manipulated by them because of how much they've tried to gaslight me by saying they arent lying to me + trying to make me feel guilty for accusing them of being liars...

The amount my mom has been asking me for recently is another 1000.

 Im stressed out bcs of course i care and would like to help because its my parents, and im their only kid. But i cant help but think that if i do it'll just allow them to keep acting this way. AITA?",0.0,-0.0130477855,0,1
101,1fdzq7j,AITA for asking my sister to save her pity for outside my celebration?,"I have been unemployed for several months and moved back home with my parents. I left my last job due to being disrespected by management. I get some interviews but nothing sticks until today. I have never made more than $40,000. I asked for $60,000 and was somehow offered $100,000 due to it being in the city. I cried. I told my family. The recruiter told me that the head of the department really enjoyed our interview & sympathized with my struggles as he has worked in the industry for a while and knows what it can be like.

I am celebrating with my family & my sister (who's in college) starts crying & talks about how she will never make as much as me. She is on the Dean's List. She makes great grades but has always worked as a server at restaurants in HS & college.

I reassure her that she is incredibly smart and capable and will accomplish a lot but it takes time. As we go out to eat and celebrate more she keeps pitying herself. She talks about how she will never be anything and I just get lucky (which is unfounded). Eventually, I can't take it anymore.

Every time I accomplish something, get a job or raise she does this.

I got frustrated and lost my temper and told her to save her pity party for another time and that I deserve to be celebrated without having her tear me down. I called her selfish and told her to grow up. I tried explaining it's like attending someone's birthday party and crying because you didn't get as many gifts for your birthday. I asked her how she would have felt if I did this to her every time she accomplished something. I admit I was very frustrated and was aggressive with my words.

She claimed that all she ever wanted to do was express her feelings as they related to life accomplishments. My family sided with my sister and said I was out of line.

102,1fdzj6t,AITA for telling my sister that she is a hypocrite for snooping in my mom’s phone?,"Hi. I just needed to rant but do tell me ur opinion. ☺️


Now this is my first post so pls excuse my grammar. 

Now im 20F and my younger sister is 19F. 

When we were younger. She would always never allow us (my younger brother mostly) to go through her phone which. I understand and respect her boundaries. But i find it funny that she doesn’t like us going through her phone even tho she goes to everyone’s phone or try to look at someone’s else screen. And recently she got a new phone. Today i caught her looking through my mother’s phone. Which i told her. Why are u going through our mother’s phone?, its privacy yk. 

She than said. Well im not doing anything suspicious. (She went through my mother’s whatsapp and look through her chats scrolling down and all) yea sure. And than i told her. Yk ur being a hypocrite. Ur going through ur mother’s phone and don’t like us going through ur phone.

So than she proceed to argue with me saying. Its our mother yk. I told her but hello thats privacy. Thats the thing called privacy. She than proceed to say. But she trust us etc. And said she doesnt have a problem with it, Is it ur problem?.Um? She’s also my mother. Whats funnier is that she than told me. She understands what privacy means but for some reason cant see the argument at all.
Listen my mother is from an old generation ofc she doesnt understand privacy and stuff but my sister? She’s 19. So atleast have respect for ur mother privacy and all.

103,1fdz1jw,WIBTA if I backed out on volunteering? ,"I (24f) am signed up to volunteer at a car show/food drive in two weeks. Tonight my friends from college texted me asking if I wanted to go to the Ren faire with them the same weekend. I asked if another weekend would work since not only am I supposed to volunteer on Saturday, but I also have my cousins wedding on Friday night. All four said that this is the only weekend they can.

Normally I stick to my commitments even if a better option arises, but since these are college friends I don’t get to see them that often. We text everyday, but it’s not the same as seeing them in person. The last time I was able to see them was in June and it’s now September. The college is 2 hours away so it’s not like I can commute to see them during the week and on weekends I can only go see them if they invite me since I would be sleeping on their couch. Two of them live together with two other roommates I barely know/don’t know so it’s also making sure their roommates are ok with a stranger staying at their place for a weekend. I also don’t really have friends to hang out with here in my hometown since they are either away at college, or have full time jobs with busy schedules. 

The volunteering is something I said yes to simply because I didn’t have plans at the time. The only reason I was asked to volunteer is because my grandparents volunteered last year and I went to visit them there to make them happy. At the end of the event I helped them clean up since i worked events in college and could carry tables by myself. I was happy to be doing that kind of work again because I enjoyed event management and the organizer was very grateful for my help. My grandma talked me up to her since I did events in the past and gave her my phone number to contact for this year if she needed help putting the event together. She only contacted me for volunteering day of, which was fine since I don’t really know her or anyone else running the event. The only time I spoke to her was that day until she texted me asking me to volunteer. She didn’t ask my grandparents to volunteer again so I have no clue if they will be there to keep me company or if I would be with strangers who are old enough to be my parents and grandparents all day.

The Ren faire itself would be 4 hours away for me in one of my friends hometown (2 hours from college). I would consider just going Sunday with them and driving up after my volunteer is over on Saturday, but Sunday would be a short day since they have classes Monday and I have work and would need to drive home that night. So my options are either driving the 4 hours after my cousins wedding, very early Saturday morning, or not at all. I really want to see my friends from college, but feel bad about backing out of volunteering. What should I do?

Ex: makeup, hair stuff, clothes… it would be different if it was necessities. Theres other stuff like making me pay for random stuff she dont even need. She has a job and has a income but I do not. 

I know you probably think it’s silly that I said no, but i’m saving up for a car and i dont have much money. I dont work bc I don’t have reliable transportation so i’m saving up.

Since we shared that moment, our bong grew stronger. I knew in the back of my mind that the pairing wouldn’t turn out well, since they were something I didn’t like: racist.

I have expressed how I felt about this multiple times, it just didn’t feel like they cared.

108,1fdyrlk,AITA for telling my friends I'm not comfortable with talking them anymore?,"I think the NSFW tag applies here, so I added it just in case. Let me know if I'm wrong.

I (17F) have had this friend (17M), for about two or three years now. A few weeks ago he introduced me to his other friend group, and I've been hanging around with them regularly now. The first few times we met, they seemed really nice.

The problem started happening a week ago. One of my friend's friends (17M) joined the group one day and halfway through the conversation, he randomly started discussing things like doing something pretty messed-up sexual things to his crush, and everyone just joined in and acted like it was normal. The conversation just kind of escalated from there. At one point, they added me to the conversation and my friend's friend said some explicit things directly to me, and everyone laughed it off while I was there feeling uncomfortable.

Just four days ago, one of the people in the friend group said the N-word (he isn't black, and he explicitly said he wasn't black when I asked). And every since then, they've just been using a lot of slurs, such as the F-slur and using ""gay"" as an insult (none of them are gay). I was shocked and told my best friend (17F), and she told me that what they were saying was seriously messed up and I should definitely confront them about it.

I'm a naturally non-confrontational person, so it took a bit of convincing, but she eventually persuaded me to. The next day I told my friend I wasn't comfortable with talking with his friend group and he seemed really confused and asked why not. I cited the things I said above, and he just told me that I was being too sensitive and I should ""lighten up.""

We didn't really have anything to say after that, so I just left. I assume my friend told the friend group about what I had said, because a day later, one of them cornered me and got upset (it was the same guy who'd said the N-word while not being black). He called me ""autistic,"" which I think he meant as an insult. He also said his black friend gave him an N-word pass, so he could say it. He told me I was being a ""snowflake.""

I'm really second-guessing my decision right now. My best friend says I did the right thing, but a good portion of my other friends are saying that I was too easy to become offended and I probably overreacted. One of my good friends (17F) made a point that I should have just walked away and stopped talking to them gradually, rather than confronting them and that by confronting them, I was just openly antagonizing them, which nobody likes. In hindsight, that was probably a better option for someone like me who doesn't enjoy confrontations, but I also kind of feel like communicating is better for a relationship. I don't know, though. My friend has been avoiding me for the past few days, I think, so I probably upset him. I really need to know once and for all if what I did was right.

He called me ""autistic,"" which I think he meant as an insult. He also said his black friend gave him an N-word pass, so he could say it. He told me I was being a ""snowflake.""

I'm really second-guessing my decision right now. My best friend says I did the right thing, but a good portion of my other friends are saying that I was too easy to become offended and I probably overreacted. One of my good friends (17F) made a point that I should have just walked away and stopped talking to them gradually, rather than confronting them and that by confronting them, I was just openly antagonizing them, which nobody likes. In hindsight, that was probably a better option for someone like me who doesn't enjoy confrontations, but I also kind of feel like communicating is better for a relationship. I don't know, though. My friend has been avoiding me for the past few days, I think, so I probably upset him. I really need to know once and for all if what I did was right. AITA?",0.0,-0.002930458,0,1
109,1fdy1db,AITA for screwing up trying to help my GF recover stolen furniture?,"My girlfriend bought a new vacation home in the rural woods. The place needs furnishing, so she purchased a pricey piece of furniture online to have it delivered there. She doesn't get down to the new house very often, so it took her a few weeks to realize that FedEx said the furniture had been delivered, but after not being able to find the package at the house, she realized she put in the wrong address. It was in the next town over.

She wasn't going to be able to get back to the town for a while, and I recently became unemployed, so I offered to make the two hour drive down there to try and figure out what happened to it.

After driving around for a bit, I found the address that she entered by mistake. The address wasn't a physical house, but there was a house nearby that seemed like it might have ended up there. FedEx had a photo of where they dropped it off, and after a while, I was able to find the spot in front of a house that I was pretty sure matched the photo.

I knocked, and a woman answered. I told her I was helping a friend try to locate some new furniture that went to the wrong address. She said she knew nothing about it. I showed her the photo and said it looked very much to me like the spot where it was delivered. She politely continued to say that she knew nothing about it.

I called my girlfriend to an update. We were both suspicious that the woman probably took it and kept it for herself. Both FedEx and the company who sold the furniture said they couldn't help, since it was my girlfriend's mistake. My girlfriend suggested I leave a letter for the woman with my GF's phone number, and try to appeal to her sense of decency.

This is where things went sideways. When I was discussing the letter I would write, I mentioned I would leave her phone number. ""But not my address?"" she asked. I mistakenly thought she was saying that I should leave the address in the note.

So I wrote a note asking the women at the house to please let my GF know if she remembers anything, or hears about any large packages that were found. I included her phone number, and her address at her new home in the woods.

I left the note on her door (she wasn't there or was no longer answering) and made the two hour drive home.

When I returned home, my girlfriend asked if I left the note. I said I did, and included her address. She got pissed. She said she specifically didn't want me to include her address for fear of retaliation or something. I told her I misunderstood She said I was wrong, that I should have told her exactly what I was going to write in the letter, and that I've now made a bad situation even worse.

I apologized for my misunderstanding, but I pointed out that I was trying to do her a favor. I made the long drive, spent time looking around and talking to people, all to correct a mistake that she made. But now she's super pissed at me, and I'm feeling under appreciated right now.

My brothers in the other hand didn’t go to college. Unfortunately my oldest and youngest brother died leaving 3 kids behind. 
I have helped my whole family including my only alive brother with things like a motorcycle to get to work I paid for his oldest daughter tuition and now she is a doctor. I helped him with rent and in times of need.
I have helped my parents by paying off their mortgage, renovated their home 3 times, divided the house so they can rent the other half and have money for their every day needs. They both don’t have retirement money as I am from a 3rd world country and they worked independently never saving for retirement. 
Now to the issue to make me take the decision. They are getting to the 90s and their health is deteriorating. On my last visit I asked them to make a will as the house was under the 4 kids (me and siblings) and knowing that 2 siblings are not longer alive I want to give my part and their part to their kids so they can have some money to jump start their lives. 
My parents then told me that they already transfer the ownership of the house to my  (alive) brother and his youngest son. 
I asked them how come and they say I don’t have any financial need and that why they des owned me and my brother needs it more. 
I agree I don’t need any proceeds of the house but my nieces and nephew do and what about them? They said they already made their decision and they are not leaving anything to the other grandchildren. 
I was heartbroken as I could only think of my dead brothers and how my nieces and nephew would react.
I asked how come I was not consulted on this decision and ask my brother if he knew and he said yes but there is nothing he could do. 
I told him there was plenty he could like telling our parents it wasn’t fair or at least told me of the decision. Doing everything behind my and the rest of the family’s back was not correct.
Then I realized that 6 months back I gifted my brother and his wife the plane tickets to visit my parents as I knew they couldn’t afford it and that’s is when they did the transfer of the house.
My parents and my brother even had a list of reparations they wanted me to pay on the house knowing that they already put the house under my brother’s name behind my back.
Then, I told my parents and my brother to never call me to ask me for money for the house. The money I use to send them now I was going to save for when my nieces and nephew were going to buy a house I would give it to them in the name of my dead brothers. As they were gone but no forgotten.

Recently, my boyfriend Chase (M19) and I went out for food. We invited others, but no one could come. As we passed Bea’s house, Chase suggested we stop by to see if she wanted to join us. We texted Bea but didn’t get a reply, so we thought it was okay to go to her door. We didn’t ring the bell or knock, we just texted her to check if she was awake. We figured she was home alone since her car was in the driveway and no other car was there.

When Bea didn’t respond, we went to get food. I told Chae about it, and she got really upset. She said Bea’s parents are strict about who comes to the door and that it was weird for us to show up unannounced. I was surprised because Bea’s parents had seen me and Chase before and let us hang out with Bea at various places.

Later, Bea texted our group chat saying she was asleep when we came by and that we should never do that again. She felt uncomfortable with Chase and said we were trying to isolate her from her friends. Chase and I were shocked. We didn’t mean to cause trouble. Chase apologized, explaining he just wanted to invite Bea to join us. Bea said she only sees Chase as my boyfriend, not a friend, which confused me since we’ve all hung out together before.

Chase and I were hurt. We tried to explain that we felt bad when Chae and Maia excluded Bea from an Oregon trip a few months ago. Bea said she didn’t need saving, and Maia said Chase shouldn’t comment on the trip.

In a separate chat, Maia said they weren’t mad at me but didn’t like how Chase handled things. Maia and Chae had previously said negative things about Bea, why suddenly switch up now? They said they never liked Chase and felt like they were losing me to him, which was surprising since they never mentioned this before. Maia and Chae also accused Chase of being rude and manipulative. Chase’s background is different, and his opinions can be stricter, but he always meant well.

Everybody now seems to be angry at me for defending Chase and for wanting everyone to become friends so we can be one big friend group together?

Of course I was wrong in letting her do that,and by the way after a while he forgave me for betraying his trust by being a “spy”. Today they’re trying to understand if they could be happy getting back together,especially since he’s really unhappy and undecisive. He’s having issues at work and talked to my sister about it,and I told her that in my opinion he should follow through with his dream and go in another country. That’s when Hell started to break loose,she told me to not say this to him,’cause if he followed through they would never get back together. I,of course, told her that if he started to work on this dream it couldn’t be from my suggestion alone,he clearly wanted to do that already.

113,1fdxjtt,AITA for not towing my brother's car in a flood?,"I'm a bit torn on this one. A little while back there was a really crazy thunderstorm in our neighborhood. My brother works 3rd shift so he starts work at 11 pm. During this storm, my brother drove his Toyota Corolla into a big puddle at the bottom of a hill a few blocks from our house. 

He called me around 11 pm to let me know his car was dead. I immediately asked him if he needed me to pick him up, to which he said No, because he was waiting for the tow truck. As a side note, I'd been having terrible insomnia for the whole year and this was only the 3rd time this year I actually managed to sleep before midnight because I start work at 6 am.

I had an uneasy feeling and couldn't sleep because I hadn't heard my brother come back home, so around midnight I got up and called him to see if he was alright. He said that due to the storm, there were too many other cars needing a tow and he would have to wait longer for the truck. I asked him again if he wanted me to pick him up. Again, he said no, he wanted to wait for the tow truck.

\^--This happens again at around 1 am. Finally, at 3 am he calls me and asks if I can use my car to come and pull his car out of the mini pond using some ropes. He said his car was completely dead and that the water already flooded the inside up to his windows. I told him that I had to wake up in 2 hours, the storm had died but was now back on in full effect, and that his car was a total loss. There was no point in trying to save it now and I could come pick him up and bring him home. After work, we could get his car when it was safer, visible, and the water dried. He said no and that he would walk back home because he was already soaking wet and only 5 m away.

So this is where AITA. I come back home from work and my parents are flipping out on me the second I get back home. They said I was a terrible brother for not caring at all about my older brother. They said he was scared for his life and could have died but I left him out there on his own despite him calling me. I was so blindsided by both parents and my brother accusing me of evil-doing, that I just told them that I barely remembered the phone calls and that I was too sleepy to even think straight. 

My mom mocked my voice and response and told me I should have known better because my older brother isn't the type to know what's good for him and that I should have forced him to come home the first time. I told them I DID offer him 3 times and even woke up to call HIM. But no matter what, all 3 of them view it as my fault for not forcing him to come home.

115,1fdx52l,AITA for going off with a boy on holiday?,"On the first night of my girls holiday, two boys (Tim, Jon) came up to us. Three of us were at this club, but Tim took a liking to me, and we chatted for an hour. Jon was flirting with my friend (Tia), so I made an effort to include my friend (Lola) in singing along and dancing with us. He offered to buy me a drink, but neither of us were that drunk, so I suggested going somewhere else. His hotel room was on the strip, five minutes away. I wanted to let loose a little. I knew the risk I was taking, so I handed them the room key, asked her to share locations with me, and told them I'd see them in a bit. Jon said, ""We all know where you're going,""  so I jokingly flipped him off.

We went back to his hotel room for an hour. Upon picking up my phone, I'd seen some messages from my friend.

I'm 19 and have had boyfriends. Lola's freshly 18, has zero experience (why me going off with someone is new to her). She made multiple jokes leading up to this trip about meeting boys and such.

I promptly called her; her messages just asked where I was and asked to share location. She immediately has a go at me: ""How could you just go off?""  ""Why aren't you answering my calls?""  etc., and I'm confused, upset. I'm repeatedly saying sorry, but she must've known I was leaving when I gave her the room key and asked to share locations. She told me, ""You didn't look at me the second he came into the club,""  which left me gobsmacked. I told her that that's not true and even Jon knew I was leaving, so it's not my fault she couldn't hear me when the guy who's almost a foot taller could. She kept having a go at me, saying how worried she's been, so I just repeated sorry. I did tell her that I was upset she never shared locations with me, though.

Tim walked me back to my hotel, reassuring me. We met Jon, who also defended me but had informed me that the girls left him when he went to the toilet, so he didn't know Lola was mad.

Getting back to the hotel, all of my friends were in one hotel room, so I picked up my keys and went back to mine. I spent the next hour and a half sobbing to my mother, feeling like a slut and a bad friend. She reminded me that I'm an adult and I can make these decisions, and it doesn't make me a slut or otherwise. Lola seemed fine and told me she'd left the door unlocked for me to join them. By the time I was off the phone, she had fallen asleep. There has been no talk of this night, except for the Lola calling me ""messy"" repeatedly at the end of the holiday. It stings more when she refers to my other friend as a ""man magnet."" AITA for going off with a boy on my girl's holiday?",Asshole,2024-09-11,"AITA for going off with a boy on holiday? On the first night of my girls holiday, two boys (Tim, Jon) came up to us. Three of us were at this club, but Tim took a liking to me, and we chatted for an hour. Jon was flirting with my friend (Tia), so I made an effort to include my friend (Lola) in singing along and dancing with us. He offered to buy me a drink, but neither of us were that drunk, so I suggested going somewhere else. His hotel room was on the strip, five minutes away. I wanted to let loose a little. I knew the risk I was taking, so I handed them the room key, asked her to share locations with me, and told them I'd see them in a bit. Jon said, ""We all know where you're going,""  so I jokingly flipped him off.

We went back to his hotel room for an hour. Upon picking up my phone, I'd seen some messages from my friend.

My partner (40M) and I (33F) recently had our first baby. While I was pregnant I expressed concerns with his coaching role which requires a significant time commitment. He responded by saying we have lots of support I can call on. 

Usually they practice for 6 hours per week and then games on the weekend. Sometimes there are multiple games/ tournaments that require travel. In addition there are Monthly meetings for coaches. He has coached this team for a long time, following them up through the age brackets and it’s something he genuinely loves. He makes every effort to make sure he does what he can to support me when he leaves (often cooks dinner, cleans, etc). However it’s been really difficult recently to manage all the bedtime/ bath / feeding stuff on my own most nights, especially after I went back to work (we both work full time also). We are both exhausted and this conflict is really affecting our relationship. I have expressed my frustration and told him that I feel like he is putting others before his family, and I know he feels bad, but there isn’t really much that can be done short of him stepping back, which I am planning on asking him to do.

The computer doesn't seem to have any problem concerning it's functioning, it was just a bit dirty and I cleaned it up. 

I phoned my mother to come back asap, to at least help me cleaning up the mess and then to bring the cat to an animal's shelter cause I couldn't stand it anymore and I didn't want it to cause any more trouble. 

We've had the cat for three years now. The cat also broke a vase my mother was going to sell online and several other things of her, so she agreed with my decision. 

My grandma was very fond of the cat and she is now mad at me, saying that anyone can make mistakes. So, I don't know. Am I the asshole?

I, (15f) have a friend (15f) let's call her Sarah. For context, Sarah has been in a wheelchair almost her whole life. She doesn't have a lot of friends because of her disability, so I am one of her main friends. Our friendship started last year, but it was really rocky, and we took a break. This year, we started reconnecting. I hang out with her during school and that's not the problem. The problem is, that she wants me to be by her side 24/7, holding her hand every second of the day. Literally. At first, I didn't have an issue with it, but then she became super clingy and always wanted to know where I am at, at school. She would tell me to hold her hand going to her next classes, and wants me to walk with her, even though we are going to different places. If I say no to her, she would beg and beg until I am forced to say yes, or she would say: ""fine, I'll just stay here."" Like an elementary schooler. (We are in high school btw.) It's not just holding her hand I am forced to do, but she would tell me to get things. Here's the part where I will be sympathetic. I understand that she's in a wheelchair, and there are some things she needs help with, and I help her with that. That is the part I am not worried about. The part that I am worried about is her asking, mind you, not just me, but other people to do things for her even though she is capable of doing it herself. This is not just a one time thing, but an everyday matter. I just think she's really clingy and gets upset when someone tells her no. I want to set some boundaries so that we can both be comfortable, but I feel like if I tell her, she'll get defensive and think I am being a bad friend. I am going to be honest, she asks me to do things for her that she can do herself, and wants me to be by her side 24/7, it is kind of draining and it feels like I am her servant.

Me and my friend have known each other since we were in 4th grade. I was the first to step in and talk to her on the bus. Me and her mostly gone through everything together since then, till here recently there's been a switch up. Ever since our old friend group(from 4th grade) got reunited again things started falling apart...She came out to us a lesbian and we showed our support the best we possibly could. Till she met her now ex gf she hasn't moved on since and is trying to work on herself. After her she never could focus on herself. Recently she's been focusing on someone very close to her from church that Recently passed. I feel terribly awful about what they had to go through but she told the group about it. My now bf had not shown his sorrows about it like me and my other friend had. They had a big argument leading to the downfall of our group. She got in a call with me and the other friend in our group suggesting that me and him should break up because he did something she didn't like, also telling me to learn how to control him and his actions. Of course I can't control everything he says or does but I clearly stated I can't do nothing more but the best I can to resolve this issue. I do get he was in the wrong and I'm still aware about that but I can not do anything if she doesn't cooperate. She's blocked I'm on every social media I have her on but she has been going behind my back telling everyone I cause problems. I did go to her and tell her we can talk about any misunderstandings we may have but she denies she has said anything(I do have proof she has) or there's no misunderstandings she has but my lack of empathy.
