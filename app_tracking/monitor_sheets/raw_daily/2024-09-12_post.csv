0,1ff3zyg,WIBTA if I never came out as trans to my family?,"TLDR; moving out for university and starting testosterone in secrecy, only telling my dad about it cus he supports me, dressing up as a girl when I visit for the holidays to avoid getting potentially disowned, but otherwise being a man online, at work, at school, etc. (will tell friends and future partner im trans)  
  
I'm 17, AFAB, currently living life as a woman.   
next year I'm planning on moving out for university, getting a part time over the summer + continuing the job in Uni, and starting testosterone in secrecy.   
  
So, my family found out about this a while ago by accident, and they were pissed to put it lightly. im not gonna elaborate... it's a long story that doesn't really matter. My family so far just assumed im over that 'phase' cause I've been doing okay living life pretending to be a girl. It's not come back up in convo, and its sort of an unspoken rule to not bring up anything about it.

Anyhow, my dad's pretty supportive, surprisingly. He said once I'm 18 I can do fuck all with my life, as long as its not drugs, satanic worship, or dropping out, which i wasn't planning on doing anyway.... lol so I'm probably letting him in on the secret when it happens.  
(love u, dad!)  
  
I wanna be as stealth as possible, so I'm gonna transition socially/physically once the affects of T have really kicked in, so I don't get clocked as easily. (deeper voice, fat redistribution, more muscle increase cause I work out and hopefully the T will boost the affects)

Anyhow, I was planning on wearing wigs and unbinding my chest when I'm around my family,  softening my voice, etc. since I don't really wanna be disowned by my mom again.  
If they find out, then they find out, oh well. I'll just have to deal with it.  
  
I've lived life so long being a woman, I wont fall over and die pretending again for a few hours or a couple days when I see my relatives every now and then. It's annoying, but I'll live, it's not the end of the world.    
My whole plan is fake it till the facade cracks. (cause realistically, it will eventually.)  
I'll deal with the aftermath later.   
Basically-- Man at Uni/Work, woman on holidays when I visit home.

My reasoning?

My family is sort of already the black sheep among our extended family, and I don't want to be the reason my extended family shuns them more than they already do, by being the only trans person in the family. I care about my family a lot, and I don't think my grandmother's heart can take it anyway.  
(also, im scared of my family disowning me in general, because I love them so much, and my biggest fear is losing them.)  


\*Also, I'm not a complete prick, I'd tell people I was trans if I wanted to get romantically involved. I'm not gonna pretend to be cis to a future partner... This isn't some freaky ass kink, And no, I don't wanna touch your kids and groom them into being a transgender alien... LMFAO please don't make this into a political thread.

1,1ff1mmh,AITA for kicking my friend out of my house?,"A few years ago, I (27 non-binary) offered to let my friend (27 m male) move in with me and my wife (27 female), because he was miserable where he was living, and we agreed he‚Äôd stay with us for a year or two until he had some money saved up. We paid for the plain ticket, helped him get a job, and drove him around since he didn‚Äôt have a car. 

We agreed on a rent price just to help out with bills and groceries. Everything seemed fine at first, but then he stopped helping out with chores, his room started getting more and more disgusting, and he‚Äôd leave trash all over the house. We talked to him about helping out with chores, and even offered to try a chore chart or something like that (we‚Äôre all pretty neurodivergent). Nothing would stick more than a week or two, and when we would talk to him about it, it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt his fault that he couldn‚Äôt remember.‚Äù 

It was getting so bad that our whole house started to smell bad because he wouldn‚Äôt shower. We asked to know when people would be over, especially since he was on the night shift and would hang out with people while we were gone. But there were several times where we caught him lying about hiving people over without telling us. 

Finally, after few months ago, we told him it was time he at looking for a place to live outside our house. He found a place on eBay, moved out and a week later he was told he had to move out at the end of the month (it wasn‚Äôt exactly clear how legal everything was, but he didn‚Äôt want to do anything about it). A week after that, he got let go from his job. He was on unemployment and getting a severance package. 

We agreed to let him move in for a month, rent free, to try to get his feet under him, but only one month. We got it all in writing and everything. He was immediately as messy and gross as he had been, he never left the house, and he ate only takeout for all month. He kept telling us he was applying for jobs, but he never seemed to get any calls for interviews. Whenever we would ask if he wanted to move home, he yelled at us that we couldn‚Äôt force him to go back home. We let it go. We offered to pay for a plain to him get back to his home town if he wanted, but said that he still needed to out by the end of the month. Well, the month passed, and he didn‚Äôt have a plan. 

He refused to buy a plain ticket home (due to car troubles we couldn‚Äôt afford it anymore) because he didn‚Äôt have any money and he couldn‚Äôt take all his stuff on a plain by himself. We offered to ship anything back that he couldn‚Äôt take. He didn‚Äôt like that. So finally my wife told him that he needed to call someone and find a place to go, and he refused to leave. They had a screaming match, he refused to call anyone, and ultimately he ended up going to the homeless shelter near by. It‚Äôs been a week since then, and his parents just came and picked him and his stuff up. They didn‚Äôt talk to us ask they picked up his stuff.

2,1ffgggn,AITA for asking my parents not to judge me for having a sick day? ,"this is my first post, so apologies for any spelling mistakes. 

My dad (47M) and my stepmom (36F) and I (21F) have been living in the same house for a couple of months. I‚Äôve been taking a break from college, only a semester long, and I‚Äôve decided to move in with my parents to a change of pace. 

They expected me to get a full time job right away, but I‚Äôve been working part time and small gigs due to my experience as a worker (i‚Äôve only worked at as a mail clerk for two years and as a janitor on and off) so the job market has been difficult for me. I landed a job in canvassing for trans healthcare and I started this week, it took about two weeks to get on board. 

Anyway the first two days have been great, but I was already down the barrel of burn out from my last job as a pharmacy lab cleaner and just dealing with my parents who aren‚Äôt shy about the fact that they are disappointed in me every way possible. 

Anyway, this morning I woke up feeling terrible. I gagged on my medication and had a blistering headache. It was around 6 am so I quickly texted my boss about how I‚Äôm feeling and let her know that I don‚Äôt know if this is a one time thing or if I could be contagious with something. She was very understanding, and let me stay home for the day. (BTW for my job you have to be standing and walking around for around 8 hours a day and talking to be constantly, if I‚Äôm sick I can‚Äôt represent us well.) My boss is well aware that if one team member is miserable, all of us are miserable. 

Anyway, I took the day off, and have felt increasingly worse throughout the day, nausea shivers, headache, etc. When my dad came home from his job around 3:30, he banged on my bedroom door and screamed at me for staying home when I‚Äôve only been working for that job for two days (keep in mind I‚Äôve been working other jobs and didn‚Äôt miss a day at all). He screams that he‚Äôs always went into work sick, even if he felt his worst. I know that‚Äôs what he had to do when my siblings and I were kids, but we‚Äôre adults now, the situation isn‚Äôt the same anymore. 

I asked him to please not yell at me, that I had a headache and I was on the verge of tears. He said he didn‚Äôt care, and that I was ungrateful for everything him and my stepmom do for me. 

He said he was so disappointed, and slammed my door shut. I began crying afterwards.

3,1ffg6ud,AITA for always framing my parents in a bad light?,"When my parents are sick or working, nothing ever seems to get done in the house and I end up cooking dinner. I wouldn't have a problem with it if I hadn't been the one doing this for the past five days or so and having received next to no help. For the most part I know how to cook, but making a meal for four people with a dish I've never tried before and trying to keep the place clean while staying relatively quiet is slowly doing my head in. 

It shouldn't be such a big deal to me, but having to go buy groceries and carry them back home then prepare dinner after a full day at sixth form is just draining to me. It doesn't just apply to this either, sometimes my family will just forget to do basic things like buying vegetables, or cleaning the house, or folding the laundry. It does just feel like me and my mother doing it and she's always in a terrible mood so I don't really want to talk to her. 

They're also extremely dismissive over anything I say, my father probably couldn't tell you my age off the top of his head and my mother has everything go in one ear and out the other.

The problem I have with myself in all of this is that I'll usually find myself wanting my parents to do something a-holeish so that I can have a reason to be angry at them. I'll complain about them to my friends constantly and on a concerningly related note, I can lie to myself well enough that I don't recall proper sequences of events meaning that my perspective is scuffed anyway.

4,1fffzoj,"AITA for asking my partner to adjust how much I pay for shared rent?
","'Rent' is in quotes and here is context:

At the beginning of the year, gf and I learned I would not be able to stay in the country with her for more than 180 days due to visa restrictions, and it will be resolved end of the year. We live at her place, and there's a fixed monthly amount we pay for maintaining the place, such as parking, insurance, electricity, property tax, etc. She owns the property. I won't disclose the monthly amount but I am paying for roughly 65% of the sum of bills (we call it my 'rent' to her). When we do live together, I cover around the same 65% percent of our daily expenses, just trying to be the ""man"" of the house and this is pretty fair since freeloading is never my intention and I don't mind paying for more as the man of the relationship.

I want to remind everyone again, we learned about my shortened year at the¬†**beginning**¬†of the year but she never commented about the 'rent' I am paying, so I kept paying.

It's now September and I've only stayed a little over 2 months with her this year so far and plan on staying with her for the last 3 months of the year (total 5). However, recently, I've been thinking about all the 'rent' felt it was too much. So I asked if I could pay less for the remainder of the quarter at \~ 35% instead. This led to a huge argument where she thinks I should keep paying.

In my mind what I proposed makes sense because I've been paying thousands, especially when I am not here. Also, this reduction would only be for the last 3 months before we resume our normal arrangement. Her argument is if you're renting some place, you can't just pay the place you're staying at on demand, and I agree with this logic where¬†**if**¬†this is a place we leased together I am 100% responsible for all payments.... but this is her place we are talking about, we only moved in with her last year this time. I do have clothes there but it's not a situation where I have a dedicated room full of my things, what I am trying to describe is there is no presence of another person taking over any shared space, except for maybe 1/4 of total storage space.

INFO she did not buy it herself.

EDIT On a side note, she really ticked me off a couple of days ago with a comment about how I don't ""got her"" with the majority of finances, but I literally am based on raw numbers along. What she says is true if my 'rent' is lowered so at this point I just think she's contradicting her words with her logic... which prompted me to evaluate this whole thing

He still is somewhat active and is not fat by any means but definitely not thin. I used to be thin when Steve and I got together 18 months ago, but have since gained about 20 lbs. I‚Äôm still a healthy weight for my height, but not thin anymore.

A couple nights ago, Steve and I were out for dinner. He told me I should watch what I eat because I‚Äôm gaining weight. I rolled my eyes and ordered a burger and fries (same thing as Steve) because I thought it was just a poorly thought out joke. But on the car ride home he told me he was concerned because I was gaining weight and becoming unhealthy and less attractive. He put it gently, but I was still upset and pointed out that he wasn‚Äôt the poster child of thinness himself, but he said it‚Äôs different because he‚Äôs the same size he was when we got together.

I told him to give it a rest and slept in the guest room that night. When I woke up the next morning, he apologized profusely and begged me to forgive him. Since he‚Äôd never messed up that bad throughout our year and a half of dating, I told him we could just move past it.

I thought we had forgotten about it until last night when we were out with Steve and his friends. They were joking as male friends normally do, which means they were throwing around insults. One of Steve‚Äôs friends made a silly comment about Steve‚Äôs weight and suddenly they were all piling on. ‚ÄúYeah Steve, you ARE fat, hahaha.‚Äù Steve laughed along, but it was obvious to me that he was hurt by the comments. I thought about telling the friends to cut it out, but then remembered what Steve said to me just a few nights prior and decided he could handle a bit of playful teasing.

When we got home, Steve asked me why I didn‚Äôt stick up for him when I knew he was uncomfortable. I told him I thought he could handle it, given what he so comfortably said to me the other night. Steve said it was different because he didn‚Äôt make fun of my weight in front of my friends and he was coming from a place of concern. He said he thought we had agreed to move past the comment he made and that what I did was petty and holding a grudge. I told him we weren‚Äôt going to get anywhere with this conversation and we should take time to cool off and think.

Steve booked a hotel last night and should be getting home any minute now. I‚Äôm still not sure if what I did was wrong. I talked to my sister and she said I should have joined in with Steve‚Äôs friends and I wasn‚Äôt mean enough, but my sister‚Äôs also a lot bolder than me. If I am the AH, I should apologize when Steve gets back. Any thoughts are appreciated.

One of Steve‚Äôs friends made a silly comment about Steve‚Äôs weight and suddenly they were all piling on. ‚ÄúYeah Steve, you ARE fat, hahaha.‚Äù Steve laughed along, but it was obvious to me that he was hurt by the comments. I thought about telling the friends to cut it out, but then remembered what Steve said to me just a few nights prior and decided he could handle a bit of playful teasing.

When we got home, Steve asked me why I didn‚Äôt stick up for him when I knew he was uncomfortable. I told him I thought he could handle it, given what he so comfortably said to me the other night. Steve said it was different because he didn‚Äôt make fun of my weight in front of my friends and he was coming from a place of concern. He said he thought we had agreed to move past the comment he made and that what I did was petty and holding a grudge. I told him we weren‚Äôt going to get anywhere with this conversation and we should take time to cool off and think.

Steve booked a hotel last night and should be getting home any minute now. I‚Äôm still not sure if what I did was wrong. I talked to my sister and she said I should have joined in with Steve‚Äôs friends and I wasn‚Äôt mean enough, but my sister‚Äôs also a lot bolder than me. If I am the AH, I should apologize when Steve gets back. Any thoughts are appreciated.

Because I know this will come up, I am 5‚Äô6‚Äù and currently 155 lbs. I was 135 when Steve and I first met. Steve is 5‚Äô10‚Äù and \~210 and has been the same since we met.",0.0,0.084392249584198,0,1

7,1ffft2w,AITA for getting pregnant after my sisters miscarriage?,"I (26 female) and my husband (26 male) have been married for almost two years. We had been trying to get pregnant since we got married and had a couple of doctors visits to confirm we were healthy and nothing was wrong with either of us that would explain why it was hard for us to conceive. We decided to take a break and of corse, *BOOM* pregnant! Both of our families were equally excited and we will be expecting our precious baby boy in November‚Ä¶
Here‚Äôs the issue‚Ä¶ My little sister (24 female let‚Äôs call her Abby) met her now ex husband (24 male let‚Äôs call him Andrew) back in high school. They were the perfect couple. Andrew became more than an in law and I call him my brother even today. He never had a great family growing up so my mom took him under his wing when he and Abby moved in to save money for the wedding. Abby got pregnant (a boy)  and they rushed the wedding but it wasn‚Äôt short of perfect. They shared private vows and were both equally happy.
A few short months later, Abby was around 20 weeks pregnant when she went into the doctor‚Äôs office to check on her baby boy and the technician couldn‚Äôt find a heartbeat. We were all just devastated. (This was 5 years ago)
Abby had to deliver the baby, she was highly medicated. We all comforted her to her liking and made sure Andrew knew love too. The whole family took it very hard. 
Days turn to weeks, then months and we healed as a family‚Ä¶or so we thought. Abby turned to drugs, everything you can think of. She was already a supporter of the 420 as was I but she spent all of her money and time on the ‚Äúhard stuff‚Äù. Just to make her happy Andrew would go and help her‚Ä¶he knew it was wrong but she was in pain. 
Here‚Äôs where it gets crazy, Abby suggested adding another person into their marriage, because she came out as Bi. Nothing wrong with that we still loved and accepted her and Andrew agreed and stayed with Abby. 
Soon Abby told Andrew she was just fully Gay and wanted a divorce. Andrew was heartbroken‚Ä¶but to please her‚Ä¶he agreed. Soon Abby moved in a girlfriend and Andrew found a girl off of Tinder and moved her in as well! 4 of them all under one roof‚Ä¶
Abby would get super jealous and try to run the girlfriend off but the girlfriend was tough. 
Soon Abby had enough, broke up with her girlfriend and moved off to live with my dad states away.
She has lived there now for over a year, and has stayed on the hard stuff. Because of her location, the drugs are easier to get.
Abby would start asking for money from Andrew, myself, my mother, even other family members. AT THE SAME TIME! 
After months of this I finally called her out telling her we knew what she was spending her money on. Keep in mind she had a full time job and no bills. She would actually loose her job due to the drugs and would get another one. She‚Äôs had 6 in the last month. 
When I called her out she admitted to everything. And she told me she wanted to get sober and need me as an accountability partner saying ‚ÄúYou won‚Äôt bullsh*t me‚Äù and ‚ÄúI need someone I can trust to not back down‚Äù 
Reluctantly I agreed. And everything started out fine. I was around 20 weeks pregnant at this time. I was starting to show and taking cute bump pics and posting them on my socials. I would call Abby every day or every other day to just check in and we would talk about random things. 
One day she called me asking how things were going I told her everything was going great, I then saw, while on the phone, that a package came in. I then said out loud ‚Äúoh my package came in!‚Äù Abby asked what it was and explained it was for my baby shower/maternity photos. 
Abby started screaming at me stating I was ‚Äúrubbing it in her face.‚Äù And I am ‚Äúgloating‚Äù she hung up on me and my face was frozen in shock. Like I said earlier everyone knew I was pregnant and trying for a while, I‚Äôve posted about my journey on my socials. Never was an issue. 
I immediately called my mom asking if I was in the wrong and she didn‚Äôt say I was but told me ‚Äúmaybe you should bring it up‚Äù 
I can‚Äôt just hide my pregnancy, I will continue to post about it. I‚Äôm proud of my child and excited for this journey I‚Äôm on. And in a few short months, my son will be crying and if she calls for her ‚Äúaccountability partner‚Äù will I just ignore my child for her phone call? Absolutely not! 
I sent her a text message explaining how sorry I was for bringing the subject up and in detail told her I couldn‚Äôt be her accountability partner and risk her relapsing because she will her me bring up my child in a conversation or hear him cry in the background. She never responded. 
A week later I posted a cute picture of me and my growing son‚Ä¶Abby then went to my family stating I‚Äôm doing this on purpose. My family stuck up for me but I don‚Äôt want to be the cause of a family rivalry so I blocked her so she couldn‚Äôt use me as the bad guy‚Ä¶

12,1ffektf,WIBTA If I Reported This Kid?,"So I (M13) has been dealing with this one kid (I‚Äôll name him Z) at my school. Early last school year we became friends. But slowly and slowly, it‚Äôs become hell.

In May, I reported Z and our friend for being homophobic and racist. While that friend got some character development and realized his mistake (though he‚Äôs not in the friend group anymore), Z refuses to leave us alone.

This year, it‚Äôs just gotten worse. On Monday, he said ‚ÄúI hate f\*ggots‚Äù. He‚Äôs never gone as far as saying a slur before. Even we were surprised.

We‚Äôre used to just telling him to shut up, and no one gives a shit, but we were just done. So another one of my friends just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give him attention, act like he doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. So during the rest of this week, we haven‚Äôt said a single word to him.

Instead of stopping sitting at our lunch table or something, he got even worse. He‚Äôs called me a f\*ggot, r\*tard, and fat.

In May, I reported Z and our friend for being homophobic and racist. While that friend got some character development and realized his mistake (though he‚Äôs not in the friend group anymore), Z refuses to leave us alone.

This year, it‚Äôs just gotten worse. On Monday, he said ‚ÄúI hate f\*ggots‚Äù. He‚Äôs never gone as far as saying a slur before. Even we were surprised.

We‚Äôre used to just telling him to shut up, and no one gives a shit, but we were just done. So another one of my friends just said ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt give him attention, act like he doesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù. So during the rest of this week, we haven‚Äôt said a single word to him.

Instead of stopping sitting at our lunch table or something, he got even worse. He‚Äôs called me a f\*ggot, r\*tard, and fat.

13,1ffe2fx,WIBTA for telling my dad he can't meet my partner?,"My dad (52M) and I (22F) have been extremely close most of my life, but over the last year or two we've started arguing pretty severely. I have always loved traveling and have been out of the country a fair bit of times, every time either on a school trip or on my own. My dad has never had any interest in leaving the country, and he gets incredibly upset/angry when I do so. He has said some pretty hurtful things during these arguments, like that I'm wasting my time, money, and life, that I need to ""start living in the real world,"" and several implications that our relationship will never be the same because of my travels. I know that he is coming from a place of hurt, he feels abandoned and like I'm leaving him and my family behind, so I try to not argue back, just sit quietly, listen, and tell him that while I understand, I'm ultimately an adult and will continue traveling/going through with my plans.

Last year, on a trip abroad, I met my now-boyfriend (21M). We hit it off very well and kept talking casually for several months, seeing each other when I was in the area, and officially labeling our relationship several months ago now. At first, my dad was very against this relationship. When he found out I went on a date on my trip he told me he would ""never fully trust me again,"" and told me I was crazy and wasting my time, although he did stop once my BF came to visit me in my college town. Since then, I thought he had accepted this, as he frequently asks and jokes about my BF, has asked when my family can meet him, even had a nickname for him. I was genuinely excited to introduce them, as I really believe they would get along well.

Recently, I told my dad I planned to take a long trip to visit my BF, and, while I expected an issue with the trip itself, he said a lot of really hurtful things about my relationship. He said that I need to move on, that we are not ""really together"" because we don't see each other in person every day, to see other people/find someone here, that he's probably cheating and will outgrow me/lose interest, that I'm wasting my time and life, etc. He was also very angry that I have not introduced them yet. Since this, though, I have lost all interest in introducing them at all, and want to tell him that I will not be doing so.

IMO, either my relationship is real and I should introduce him to my parents, or it is invalid, as my dad says, and I have no reason to introduce them at all. Maybe it's spiteful, but I want to tell my dad that if that's how he feels, then there's no reason for them to meet at all. It genuinely makes me sick to picture him playing nice to my BF's face and then telling me to see other people once he leaves. That being said, I know all of this would just cause more conflict, so WIBTA for telling my dad that, if that's his opinion, he's not meeting my BF?

14,1ffe1yf,AITA for calling cps on my hoarding sister?,"My sister (48F) has 4 children (10m, 12f, 16m, 20m) with her ex husband (62m). They aren‚Äôt legally separated, but split the kids 50/50. I visited her recently and discovered just how bad her mental health and hoarding is. 

12f is staying with her full time because of a fight she had with her dad. After 1 month, her hair is completely matted to her head, she has no clean clothes, and hasn‚Äôt showered in days. According to her, my sister says she doesn‚Äôt have to use deodorant, brush hair or teeth, or shower if she doesn‚Äôt want to. When I told my sister I was worried about how her kids are living, she told me I was not allowed to see her daughter ever again.

I was talking to 20m and he said she tells the kids their dad abuses them by making them do housework, take care of personal hygiene, and complete schoolwork. He also sent photos of her house and it is disgusting. Piles of garbage, dirty clothes, and rotting food everywhere. If there was a fire in the kitchen they would all die because there is no way out. He said they all like going to her house because they can just play video games all day and don‚Äôt have to do anything.

I called cps on her and now she and the kids arent talking to me. She called and screamed at our mother first, thinking it was her. Our mom said it wasn‚Äôt her, so obviously it was me. She used to fill her bedroom with garbage as a kid and scream when our parents made her clean. Her ex also sent me photos of their house and how disgusting it would be if he came back from a work trip (pre and post kids). She blames the kids for the mess, but also she refuses to get help or even let her ex have the kids for a few months while she gets it together. 

Here is where I might be the asshole, she‚Äôs been dealing with mental illness and lost her job because of chronic pain. She had a horrible experience at the hospital 4 years ago and has ptsd from it. She needs help. If she loses custody, her ex will get the kids full time and, according to my sister, he is manipulative and abusive. She claims he doesn‚Äôt send her enough money (he sends her enough to cover her rent and some utilities) and that he is strict with the kids.  I know the kids love their mom, is that enough to overlook their living situation? Should I have just left it? Will living with their dad be worse?

Edit for more information

-They are all ‚Äúhomeschooled‚Äù, from my knowledge they only do workbook at their dad‚Äôs house

-no one but the kids know how bad it is because she doesn‚Äôt let people come into the house

-this came after 2 years of begging her to clean and offering to do it myself and hire a cleaning team that is specifically for hoarders. She won‚Äôt even admit she‚Äôs a hoarder, just a little messy and suffering from illness. She says her house is an extension of her mind and it‚Äôs ok it looks like this because she‚Äôs sick.

18,1ffda5z,AITA for telling my mom that I do not like her being at the restaurant,"So me (25F) and my boyfriend (30M) had a nice dinner planned for the both of us after I have been gone to Greece with my mom on a vacation for 8 days. My mom and I had the best time and had a lot of fun and deep conversations and I told her I was going to go get dinner with my boyfriend of almost 6 years today after the vacation to talk about the vacation and tell and show him everything. 

My mom then subtly inclined that she would also love to be there to talk about the vacation with us, where I politely declined and told her that after 8 days of not seeing my boyfriend I would love to have a dinner with him alone to catch up after everything because I missed him very much and that I would love to catch up with the four of us (my dad includes) next week or so. 

The vacation then went on and when we arrived back 2 days ago everything was fine, till 5 hours ago. I was looking forward to this evening and was preparing everything to show my boyfriend and was excited as we pulled up to the restaurant in the car, but then I see my parents car also parked there, I then pointed it out to my boyfriend who thought not much of it and I also thought that because we were going to dinner my mom must have been jealous and choose to also go to another restaurant in the neighbourhood or to the same dinner but still respect boundaries and ask for another table. 

We then walked over to check in where they have the papers with names on them and I quickly checked to see her name above mine. My heart instantly sank as I just wanted a quiet evening with my partner talking about the fun we had. 

So I was a bit dissapointed and also frustrated that my mom did not respect my boundaries. When the ober led us to our table I saw my mom and dad smirking. While walking to the table I blurted out: I do not like this, I do not like this at all. (In dutch) Which honestly could have been more tactic than this but I was also high in emotion. My mom then stood while I was sitting down and said angrily that if I did not like it she would leave and stormed off while I said to her to sit down so we could talk about it. 

She then stormed off to the car while my dad stayed seated and also called after her, he than said to me that I know how my mom is and that it will be okay but that he is going to follow her now.    Leaving my boyfriend and me stunned. 

I understand that my mom wanted to surprise me and to talk about the vacation together but she did not respect my boundaries and went to do this without communicating with either me or my boyfriend that she wanted to come. But I did hurt her feelings by reacting this way. She also does not want to talk to me atm and ignores my calls and messages meanwhile my dad said to give her a few days and that I know how my mom behaves and to try to talk it out later. So am I the asshole? 

EDIT- The reason I didn't turn away immediatly when seeing the car/spotting the name is because I did not think my mom would really intrude, and maybe a bit na√Øve but I hoped that we could talk it out but as I said my emotions also got the better of me when I saw that she really was there and that's when I blurted. 

I also have anxiety with situations with conflicts and did not want to put the waiters in a position where they had to deal with it the moment I saw her name. Plus it all happened pretty fast when you're in a situation. I also did not just go sit somewhere else because I am a 100% sure my mom would have trampled the whole restaurant to find me. 

I also did not just leave last moment when spotting the car because I am also a 100% sure she would probably be even angrier with me that way. And I also wanted my evening not ruined and at the moment calculated that this would be the best option but man I'm bad at math. 

I also want to state that my mom is not a bad person, she has her own issues and insecurities that make her act like this which ofcourse is not an excuse, but makes it more understandable but equally difficult as I can empath with her being hurt in this situation and that makes it more difficult for me to let it go. I am also in therapy and making my own progress on this topic as we speak üòä

UPDATE- My mom responded to my text saying she has no need to talk, and that because I was so unhappy to see rhem she does not know how to react to my previously texts (which states my feelings and a short apology for responding my blurt out)

 I responded that I will not fight this over whatsapp and that when she is ready to talk like an adult she is more than welcome to and I think that would be no problem because we had quite the bonding on vacation so this will be also no problem. 

I'm just waiting now for my mom to make the move and to let me know when she is ready to talk about it. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-12,"AITA for telling my mom that I do not like her being at the restaurant So me (25F) and my boyfriend (30M) had a nice dinner planned for the both of us after I have been gone to Greece with my mom on a vacation for 8 days. My mom and I had the best time and had a lot of fun and deep conversations and I told her I was going to go get dinner with my boyfriend of almost 6 years today after the vacation to talk about the vacation and tell and show him everything. 

My mom then subtly inclined that she would also love to be there to talk about the vacation with us, where I politely declined and told her that after 8 days of not seeing my boyfriend I would love to have a dinner with him alone to catch up after everything because I missed him very much and that I would love to catch up with the four of us (my dad includes) next week or so. 

The vacation then went on and when we arrived back 2 days ago everything was fine, till 5 hours ago. I was looking forward to this evening and was preparing everything to show my boyfriend and was excited as we pulled up to the restaurant in the car, but then I see my parents car also parked there, I then pointed it out to my boyfriend who thought not much of it and I also thought that because we were going to dinner my mom must have been jealous and choose to also go to another restaurant in the neighbourhood or to the same dinner but still respect boundaries and ask for another table. 

We then walked over to check in where they have the papers with names on them and I quickly checked to see her name above mine. My heart instantly sank as I just wanted a quiet evening with my partner talking about the fun we had. 

So I was a bit dissapointed and also frustrated that my mom did not respect my boundaries. When the ober led us to our table I saw my mom and dad smirking. While walking to the table I blurted out: I do not like this, I do not like this at all. (In dutch) Which honestly could have been more tactic than this but I was also high in emotion. My mom then stood while I was sitting down and said angrily that if I did not like it she would leave and stormed off while I said to her to sit down so we could talk about it. 

She then stormed off to the car while my dad stayed seated and also called after her, he than said to me that I know how my mom is and that it will be okay but that he is going to follow her now.    Leaving my boyfriend and me stunned. 

I understand that my mom wanted to surprise me and to talk about the vacation together but she did not respect my boundaries and went to do this without communicating with either me or my boyfriend that she wanted to come. But I did hurt her feelings by reacting this way. She also does not want to talk to me atm and ignores my calls and messages meanwhile my dad said to give her a few days and that I know how my mom behaves and to try to talk it out later. So am I the asshole? 

EDIT- The reason I didn't turn away immediatly when seeing the car/spotting the name is because I did not think my mom would really intrude, and maybe a bit na√Øve but I hoped that we could talk it out but as I said my emotions also got the better of me when I saw that she really was there and that's when I blurted. 

I also have anxiety with situations with conflicts and did not want to put the waiters in a position where they had to deal with it the moment I saw her name. Plus it all happened pretty fast when you're in a situation. I also did not just go sit somewhere else because I am a 100% sure my mom would have trampled the whole restaurant to find me. 

I also did not just leave last moment when spotting the car because I am also a 100% sure she would probably be even angrier with me that way. And I also wanted my evening not ruined and at the moment calculated that this would be the best option but man I'm bad at math. 

I also want to state that my mom is not a bad person, she has her own issues and insecurities that make her act like this which ofcourse is not an excuse, but makes it more understandable but equally difficult as I can empath with her being hurt in this situation and that makes it more difficult for me to let it go.

19,1ffd4uj,AITAH for telling my friend about how I grieved for my grandmother when she lost her dog?,"I (40f) have almost never lost friends and she (44f) and I have been friends for 10 years. Her parents‚Äô dog was 16 and was having a hard time hearing and seeing and could no longer walk up the stairs they put going to the couch. We had many conversations about how she was wondering how she was going to process this incoming situation as she had never lost someone before. She wasn‚Äôt sure if she could make a trip up to see me as she was living with her parents since the pandemic and her parents‚Äô were also paying for her San Francisco apartment for 4 years and she left the window opened but everything was covered in mold so she didn‚Äôt want to go back the last time she went there. So she got very close to the dog as she was doing so much extra work in the elder care of the dog. Her parents were getting older and it was harder for them to care for all the needs of the dog so having her there was amazing. 

This is where people can hate on me. I love animals and have lost both animals over the years but also family members and work friends. On the day her dog died she called me for comfort. Don‚Äôt forget I thought I knew her after 10 years and she knew my personality for 10 years, too. I asked her if she wanted to talk wonderful memories of her dog and she said yes so I asked about happy memories and she started but she couldn‚Äôt and I tied to be meet her where she was. 

I said that there was nothing I could say to make it feel better (that is terrible I get that) and grieving is incredibly complicated and told her the process isn‚Äôt linear and I went through with grieving my grandmother. 

I said when I woke up in the morning the day after my grandmother passed, it all came rushing back to me that my grandmother died. I turned on the TV and everyone was laughing and having a good time with one of the morning shows. I told her how I felt about how painful loss is when everyone keeps going on around you. And how I felt how everyone can be happy when Im dealing with loss. It was part of grieving. 

She said ‚Äúhow can you make this about you‚Äù and it was not. I get that maybe I could have not talked about my grieving experience but that‚Äôs how I relate to people and I always wanted to hear her experiences to help me with things. She didn‚Äôt talk to me since.

I wished her a happy birthday and she told me while she will always care about me, too much had ‚Äúpast‚Äù (spelled incorrectly) to ever be my friend again.

This is also the girl who cried to me about how her mom didn‚Äôt give her an Easter basket last year. She expected American Girl doll clothes and wondered to me why she was crying. I was supportive I thought there as well.

School is the only escape i have from home. I tried connecting with her when i was a child but i slowly started realizing what was happening to me so i distanced myself from everyone.

He left my grandma for another woman when my mom was just born in the 80's after our family gave him money and social status. We got into a fight this morning because she was blaming me saying WE lost huge opportunities because i wasnt home and said i was the worst person ever i told her that it was because of all i went through and she brushed it off saying she went through worse stuff. Its almost 3pm and i havent talked to her or other members or my family yet, AITA? 

* To clarify, she hasnt always been like this, when i started school she would call me crying in the middle of the day saying she missed me and was scared for me but she told me that as long as i went to school she would make my life a living hell which she has succeded in so far. School is the only escape i have from home. I tried connecting with her when i was a child but i slowly started realizing what was happening to me so i distanced myself from everyone. When im home from school she keeps trying to make me mad by saying stuff like go back to your country or i shouldve aborted you.my 'dad' is arab but he isnt around since my mom slept with him for a favor (which wasnt even for her). i depend on her for pretty much everything possible and my family is telling me to apologize for being like this. Im an excellent student all my report cards so far have an A+ in every single subject, im elegible for carrying the flag at school and i give speechs regularly, so academic performance isnt the problem.",2.0,0.1138739436864852,0,0
26,1ff9uiv,AITA For making my husband cancel a hunting trip after he had jury duty,"My husband (38M) and I (36F) have been married for 12 years and have 3 kids (10, 8, & 4).  I am a SAHM and have been since our oldest was born.  My husband makes a decent living but with our kids now entering an age where they have more activities/sports, our budget has gotten a little tighter.  Not like paycheck-to-paycheck tight, but we have to be more conscious of our spending.  

With 3 kids, neither my husband nor I get much time for ourselves.  He claims I get more than he does because my mom or sister will take our 4-year-old sometimes so that I can more easily run errands or get something done at home.  If my husband wants time for himself, he will usually plan it out in advance.  But he will take a whole weekend to go fishing, hunting, or camping with friends.  Sometimes he will take one or both of our older kids with him. He does this a few times a year.  

He has a hunting trip planned for this coming weekend.  It's been on our calendar since July so it's not a last minute thing.  But he is going out of state to hunt with a few friends for a 3-day weekend.  A few weeks ago, he got a notification in the mail that said he was summoned for jury duty.  He got selected for a trial last week that took 4 days.  He had to get up earlier than usual each morning and came home much later.  The alternative was him getting a hotel and not being home at all but I wanted his help at home even if it was just for a few hours each night.

By the end of the trial, I was exhausted.  The kids ran me ragged and I needed a break.  I told him that I was at the end of my rope and need time for myself.  He reminded me about his hunting trip and told me to plan something for anytime after that.  I told him I can't handle another long weekend with him out of the house and that he either needs to cancel his hunting trip or find someone to help with the kids so I have a break because I don't have the energy for it.

He said he tried all our usual babysitters and nearby family but no one could help on such short notice.  Honestly, I don't know how hard he really tried but that's what he said.  I told him that if he can't find someone, he needs to stay home so that I can at least have help and try to get some rest and relax.  

He got upset and told me that he planned this trip way in advance and it's not his fault he got called in for jury duty or that the trial took 4 days.  He told me I can't punish him for ""performing his civic duty.""  I asked him to take at least one of the older kids but he said this isn't the type of trip that is appropriate for them since they haven't had firearm safety classes yet.  

I had to practically beg him to stay home for my own mental well-being.  He begrudgingly agreed but he told me that he feels like I manipulated him into it because I was crying.  I'm glad he's staying, but I know he's disappointed and blames me because he's been short with me ever since.

For context, Riley and I had met through my eldest sister graduation and became friends since. She have a younger sister, which I call Alex (13 F).

This happen a week before Riley birthday. I was in university when my phone started buzzing. I open it and discovered a dozen of messages from Riley. She sent all the screenshots of Alex and my ex conversation on Instagram.

33,1ff7kup,AITA for having a robot vacuum cleaner?,"I have a robot vacuum for our upstairs, where the bedrooms are, that runs every other day just to keep the place nice and free of dust or stuff you might step on with bare feet. Yesterday my GF started yelling at me suddenly and upon investigation she was in the guest room where the vacuum had sucked up something and threw an error so it parked itself there. The object ended up being an expensive diamond bracelet which broke in half at some point when it got sucked up.

She says it's my fault for having a vacuum that runs automatically every other day and I should get rid of it and vacuum the floors myself. I say 75% of the point of having an automatic vacuum is to force everyone in the house to *not leave shit on the floors* and especially not a $1000 bracelet (she says she doesn't know it got on the floor, she must have dropped it and not noticed). 

Edit to add because it's come up a couple of times:
She has her own private room for her jewelry and stuff. Basically there's a walk-in closet in the master bedroom but there's a second large walk-in closet sorta hidden beyond the master bathroom which is her private space where there's a big vanity desk thing with racks and cabinets and stuff for all of her jewelry (she has a lot). This room always stays closed. 

Edit 2: So many people misunderstanding and thinking the vacuum somehow went in her room. This did not happen. The door was closed. It must have found the bracelet in another room or the hallway.

I say 75% of the point of having an automatic vacuum is to force everyone in the house to *not leave shit on the floors* and especially not a $1000 bracelet (she says she doesn't know it got on the floor, she must have dropped it and not noticed). 

Edit to add because it's come up a couple of times:
She has her own private room for her jewelry and stuff. Basically there's a walk-in closet in the master bedroom but there's a second large walk-in closet sorta hidden beyond the master bathroom which is her private space where there's a big vanity desk thing with racks and cabinets and stuff for all of her jewelry (she has a lot). This room always stays closed. 

Edit 2: So many people misunderstanding and thinking the vacuum somehow went in her room. This did not happen. The door was closed. It must have found the bracelet in another room or the hallway. ",0.0,1.0570281744003296,1,0

I can't open it from outside (The lock must be broken) and I literally have no lock inside (So anyone in this building can just go and take my mails and packages).

I brought it up with my landlord once. He told me he would to something about it. When he came back , I showed him the mailbox. He became very condescending. He told me locks were useless anyway , that fixing the mailbox was too much work , that I was not in the position of asking him anything and that I could go away if I wasn't happy. Also , the way he spoke to me was just mean , he had this mocking and condescending tone and wouldn't listen to anything I said.

My mom has some mental issues that are probably from being married to my dad for 12 years but also means she wasn‚Äôt able to be a good mom either. 

So, we ran away when I was 8 and were basically homeless for 3 years because she refused to divorce him and I eventually ended up in the hospital and she and her boyfriend ended up in jail. 

After the hospital my auntie (I have no idea if she‚Äôs actually my auntie but that‚Äôs what I call her) picked me up and we stayed in a really nice hotel for a couple days then we went to her house. I even got to fly first class. I‚Äôve been living with her for a little over a year and it‚Äôs great. She‚Äôs not married and doesn‚Äôt have any kids so it‚Äôs just me and her. I have my own room in her house and I don‚Äôt even have to sleep on the couch when her friends come over. I even got to redecorate my room with new furniture and paint and everything. She even takes me to get my nails done twice a month and I get my hair done every 3 months at an actual salon and I get an allowance and we have movie nights and we go on vacations. She‚Äôs even gonna take me to Disney land. 

My auntie works at a place that‚Äôs kinda between a hospital and a group home for girls. It‚Äôs not a hospital, some girls get to leave for a couple hours a day and a lot of them go to school but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a group home either because they have doctors and therapists and nurses and stuff like that.

As long as I do most of my homework and participate in therapy and group my auntie is pretty chill. I got to stay home from school today just because I didn‚Äôt want to go. 

My mom‚Äôs been out of jail for a couple months and is finally divorcing my dad and now she wants me to move in with someone closer to her because we‚Äôre across the country and she can‚Äôt leave the state.

My senior from school Julia (24F), who would finish her internship in August, when I started, had warned me beforehand about a few red flags. Including overpriced rent, Mary was renting one room for 370 a month, which seems cheap and ideal, until you find out it is a room in a not yet renovated rural house with no plumbing, heating or AC (for those who don't know, these houses are sold dirt cheap in Japan, because of all the renovations needing to be made). Mary had kicked out a previous intern over rent disputes, so I decided to find my own apartment an hour away.

From the start, Mary was distant, rarely interacting with the interns in person, and most feedback was given over Skype. When I asked if I could work remotely for one day to save time on commuting, she refused harshly, which I overlooked, because message tones can be misinterpeted. The next day, Mary started showing up more but treated me coldly and criticized my work more heavily, while also trash-talking Julia's previous work to another intern, Mike (32M). I told Mike that Mary's behavior was unprofessional, and he agreed.

Later, during the end of the day Feedback moment, which we always did over skype, I confronted Mary calmly about her rude comments about Julia, stating it made me uncomfortable, if she could talk like that about Julia, it means any of us could be talked about behind our backs, which creates an untrusting work enviorment. Mary snapped and started to talk to me in a degrading and intimidating way, accusing me of sending ""whiney messages"" and dismissing my concerns about her behavior, she obviously was power tripping and trying to back me, a younger person a student dependent on her for my points, in a corner. even Mike later checked in on me afterwards, acknowledging how extreme her reaction had been. I was on the verge of tears but I'm not one to cry in front of others so I thanked him but told him I was fine.

I‚Äôve watch her dog many times and never had a problem. 

Now what I asked for (snacks) would have been under $25 max. Most stuff could be bought at the dollarstore. I told her I also wanted to make lasagna soup and I know she already has most of the stuff at home and all she needed to do was buy the ricotta cheese. 
She made a big deal about it saying it‚Äôs expensive $7 and she‚Äôs not buying it. She asked me why am I adding on stuff when that‚Äôs what I asked her in my original message that she clearly didn‚Äôt properly read.

Kid live 95% with me.only meet for 2 hours a day every, and all day on weekends
He cover almost all what kid needs. 

I paid my own bills. 

We still together talking about our financial, we had our own duty. 

With little money I have I managed to treat my self to make me happy examples shopping, get nails done, etc

While my husband focusing on ""family future"" Such as investment / planning . 
Spend nothing on himself. 
Mind you he also spend his time overseas because our recent country is not a happy place for him. 

Recently, we had fight about ""I am not focusing enough on my duty ""
He seems upset that I still manage to be happy, and he wants to punish me by cut off child support to 50-50,  so I don't have budget to be happy. 

Mind you I never micromanage his spending, even I always encourage if he wants to do something nice for him self.,  even when he decide to live overseas, I'm happy for him, because that's make him happy. 

I'm not saying this to him, but God I want to scream it at him
""Don't f* blame me if you are miserable SOB. ""

42,1ff64z5,AITA for volun-telling my BIL to do the Thanksgiving turkey?,"Last year, my mom's family decided that they would be turning this Thanksgiving into a family reunion. She comes from a very large family, and so far 53 people have RSVP-ed to come. 

The dinner itself will be hosted at my mom‚Äôs house, which is great because one of her brothers lives next door so there will be two kitchens to work with. She asked if I would plan the menu, and I agreed.

Planning the menu took a lot of work. There's limited space to cook even with two kitchens, there has to be enough food for 53+ people, and there's a lot of food restrictions. My mom‚Äôs family is Jewish and everyone keeps varying levels of kosher from only during Passover, to never mixing meat and dairy. Half the people coming are also vegetarian/vegan, some due to allergies, three people have Celiac's, and a few keep keto. Not to mention the variance between picky kids and adults who are looking forward to trying the creative dishes I'm known for. But, I still did it, and last week I posted it in the group.

Everyone was pretty nice about it and seemed excited. A few changes were made like adding a pre-made frozen keto cheesecake, and adding dino nuggets for a particularly picky kid. The one person who wasn't was my BIL. The only meats that will be there are a ham my uncle volunteered to cook before I was even planning, and some grilled fish. He commented, ‚ÄúThanksgiving with no turkey?!‚Äù and a few people responded with laughing emojis. Then he texted me about it. I told him there was limited space to cook, and everyone else seemed happy, so we could get him some Oscar Meyer, or he could cook one himself in the smoker, the only space left. He said he wasn't driving two hours to have to cook. I said no turkey then.

Then my sister texted me. She told me how upset he was. I told her what I told him. She didn't agree with me, saying I should smoke it myself, I said no there was a large menu to be cooking without additions. She still didn't agree, but left me alone. Her husband, did not. I have received texts every day since.

Yesterday I had it, I was not going to be getting these texts for two more months so I added a new post, ‚ÄúCongrats turkey lovers! A new menu item has been added, BIL has volunteered to make a turkey!‚Äù An hour later my sister called me to tell me how pissed BIL was. I asked if she knew how much he had been texting me. She did not. She still said I should've asked her to make him knock it off instead. BIL asked me to take down the post and say I lied, I refused. They got my mom involved who said I should've been more mature.

He had really pissed me off by continually messaging me, and I don't think he understood the level of thought into making the menu. But maybe I shouldn't have done what I did.

43,1ff5xim,WIBTAH For calling for a wellness check or alerting Code Enforcement regarding my friend's condemnable house?,"Some context regarding the situation:

My partner and I have been looking for a place to move due to the expiration of our lease, and we were offered a generous amount of space for a very low monthly rent payment and were genuinely thrilled to move in with a friend (60 year old male).  His previous tenants had moved out, leaving him with a lot less income, so we believed it to be mutually beneficial.

We were introduced to the space which was extremely grungy. He did not hide this nor mask this, so we weren't too caught off guard. The room lights were rather dim when we saw it.

The issues we have are what wasn't disclosed; the basement is covered in dog excrement, and mouse or rat excrement is abundant throughout. There is a plumbing issue where the upstairs bathroom is leaking water into the closet below, and I fear it will lead to mold and mildew (if not already present) as well as structural damage.

The place is decidedly uninhabitable for us, so we have made other living arrangements due to the health risks of the property. 

We have not informed him of the situation fully (want to wait for him to be sober for the conversation), but  plan to fully express our feelings to him today once we can all sit down. 

We plan to tell him that we feel living there is a risk to us AND to him, that we believe the house needs professionally cleaned, then professionally exterminated, and finally needs a professional contractor to repair the damages caused due to the lack of maintenance over the many years he has lived there. We also plan to tell him that this process will likely cost thousands; if not tens of thousands of dollars. Knowing that he does not have this amount of money, we will also state that we believe his best path forward is to sell his house and find somewhere safer for he and his dog. 

I don't want to be pushy and tell him how to handle the workload in front of him, but I do genuinely believe him continuing to live there with continued negligence of the property could lead to an exponentially increasing dangerous living situation. 

Considering calling for a wellness check or asking for code enforcement to examine the property (which will likely lead to condemnation). I don't want to make his life harder or have him threatened with homelessness, but I also don't want him living in toxic waste like rat feces.

45,1ff5hd1,AITA for getting upset at kids refusing to wash their hands or wear jackets in the cold?,"I am currently doing an internship at a kindergarten. Now the issue: Basically, let's say there are two girls, we'll call the first one T and the second one M. Both of them needed to go to the bathroom (at different times), and they asked me to accompany them because they needed some help, so I did.

I helped T get out of her splash pants, and then she finished the rest of her business. Before she left the bathroom I asked her to wash her hands. She refused multiple times, screaming ""No"" over and over again while I tried to reason with her. While doing so, she had her brother's calculator clutched into her hand, which she refers to as a ""phone"". I told her that I'd carry it for her so that she can go to the sink and wash her hands quickly, but that's when she started screeching. For context, kids are not allowed to take any toys with them (including this ""phone""). In the bathroom, there was another kid and mother with us, way younger than T. I whispered to T and told her ""Look, this kid is way younger and is washing their hands! Why don't you just quickly wash your hands, and then you can go out again and play with your friends? How does that sound?"" but again, T kept on sulking. So at one point, I got sick of it and told T: ""You know what, T? Do what you want. I will go outside now and play with the other kids."" Now, I did leave the bathroom but I was waiting against the wall right next to the bathroom door until she got out. The other kid and the mother finished, and then I finally heard another sink, that's when I knew that T was washing her hands. Then I escorted her to her friends.

Then, there is M. She also had to go to the bathroom, I helped with splash pants, and she went to the toilet. She finished, I helped her dress again and once again asked her to wash her hands, to which she at first refused. I then carried her to the sink, turned it on, and at some point she felt compelled to wash her hands already. Then, I wanted her to put on her jacket since it was, quite literally, freezing outside, and the kids are not allowed to go out without a jacket. So I asked her to stretch her arms out so I can help her into her jacket. But she refused, started thrashing around and hysterically laughing. I got sick of all of those things on that day at this point, and told her that after I count to three and she has not stretched her arms out, I will, once again, go out and play with the others. She refused, so once again, I waited outside near the door. After some time she got out, still not wearing the jacket but stretching her arms out, so I put the jacket on again. Then she went out to play.

Now, do you think I'm an asshole for acting like this? I am relatively new to this field and honestly don't even want to work with younger kids in the future, but this internship is obligatory. Most of the kids are absolute sweethearts and I love them to bits, but I can't stand the constant tantrums, especially over such trivial things like washing hands.

46,1ff5a9c,AITA for telling my sister I don't like her?,"So I apologize ahead of time for this being so long, I just have quite a bit of back story that led up to all this.

Anyway, my sister(23) and me(f)(34) are half siblings. My mom was remarried when I was 5 years old and my sister was born when I was 10. I also have a brother, he is a year older than her. I have lived with my dad 90% of my life, he got custody in the divorce. So growing up I was not able to create much of a bond with my siblings or my mom for that matter although I attempted to. As an adult I would have them over for sleepovers and eventually would spend exclusive time with my sister. Especially after my mother and step-dad got divorced and I stopped speaking to her.
My sister continued to live with my step-dad and live a very spoiled life which I would never hold against her, I am happy that she never had the difficult life I had. But as I got more mature and decided to rekindle a relationship with my mother, things began to change. And while it may seem like all small, petty things, to me it adds up to alot.
She often would tell me how broke she was after telling me she had 15k in the bank. She often complained about how terrible mom was and how they were never close, when she used to tell me all the things they did and how they were best friends. She complains that she doesn't want me to spend more on gifts but then will buy me a candle or something and buy our brother a mini fridge. And I could go on. Believe me there are worse ones.

BUT basically I decided I didn't want to hang out with her anymore really because I ALWAYS went to her (we live about 45min from each other). In the 6 years I've lived at my current home she's been here 4 times? I used to go to her house like once a week. And she never even offered to come to me, even when she worked out here. So around christmas time I went to her house to see her, my brother and my step-dad. To be honest, I have no idea how the conversation came up but I jokingly said that I didn't like her. To which she doubled down and was like ""You don't like me?!"" Now yes I could've taken it back/ lied but I'm not good at lying so casually said ""not really but I loooove you"" and I thought it was done after that.

Months later after hardly talking she sends me a long ass text about how it hurt her so bad that I said that and that if I don't want a relationship with her, I had to live with that. We went back and forth multiple times and multiple times I told her we should talk about this in person. To which she said how could she be around when she knows how I really feel. Idk guys. I know I shouldn't have said it but I have also been having medical issues to which she dismissed and I also told her it's all a me issue. I have no problems being around her or hanging out with her. I feel like she already knew how she wanted this to go and backed me into a corner. But somehow I still feel bad/ don't know what to do.

47,1ff52xl,AITA For breaking contact with my mother,"AITA For breaking contact with my mother 

So i dont really know how to start this but when i was a kid basically all the memories i have is with my mother and when i think back she was a really good mother. My dad was mainly around on the weekends becouse the year before i was born he had started his own bussiness.

But when i was 8 years old my mother wanted to divorce my dad and forced me to move with her even though i was very clear i wanted to stay where i lived and stay in my school with my friends but my mother told me that she has always been there for me and my dad never was and all of that stuff it did not change my opinion but i did still not have a choice.

So i had to move with my mother in to a small apartment about 80 kilometers away from where i lived and went to a new school and i really did not like it there but my mom told me to get used to it and give it time.
It was at this time my mother developed a drinking problem and i could come home from school to my mom being black out drunk.

At least i got to stay with my dad on the weekends so every friday after school my dad drove 80km to pick me up and 80 km home to where he lived. And every monday before he started work he drove me to school and then drove home again and went to work.
I really could not understand why my mom told me all these bad things about my dad becouse he never drank alcohol when i was with him and he always made me the best meals and really did everything for me.

After living with my mother for about 8 months i had enough and askes my mother please If i could move back to my dad and she got very mad at me and started crying and screaming at me to go call him and go live with him if i think he is so perfect and all of that. 
And so i did and ofcourse my dad heard i was sad and came and picked me up and let me move back home and start in my old school.
But now every other weekend i was at my mothers place and she had gotten a new boyfriend and they had bought a house together and all of that.
But in the 7 years i was at my moms home every other weekend i think she was sober 5-8 times sometimes she was already drunk when i arrived becouse sometimes my dad would drive me all the way and other times they would Meet in the middle. Other times when i was supposed to be at my mothers place and we were supposed to meet in the middle she had been drinking so she could not even meet me half way.


I started to make money on the side when i was 17 by buying broken cars fixing them and then selling them so when i told my mother i was making some decent money she got really mad at me and she told me that she deserves some of that money becouse of everything she has done for me and that was when i had it and broke contact with her.



There is more to this but it is long enough as it is right now but i should add that she tried to manipulate me alot and told me lies on top of lies.

But now every other weekend i was at my mothers place and she had gotten a new boyfriend and they had bought a house together and all of that.
But in the 7 years i was at my moms home every other weekend i think she was sober 5-8 times sometimes she was already drunk when i arrived becouse sometimes my dad would drive me all the way and other times they would Meet in the middle. Other times when i was supposed to be at my mothers place and we were supposed to meet in the middle she had been drinking so she could not even meet me half way.


I started to make money on the side when i was 17 by buying broken cars fixing them and then selling them so when i told my mother i was making some decent money she got really mad at me and she told me that she deserves some of that money becouse of everything she has done for me and that was when i had it and broke contact with her.



There is more to this but it is long enough as it is right now but i should add that she tried to manipulate me alot and told me lies on top of lies.

48,1ff4ygx,AITA for kicking my teammates out of their own team?,"I recently joined a hackathon team with 5 other people‚Äî3 of us were computer science students, and 3 were medical students from Zimbabwe. From the start, no one took the initiative to even register the team, so I ended up doing it and became the team leader. I also came up with the project idea and convinced the group to go with it.

The issue was that the project didn‚Äôt require any input from the medical students, so the 3 of us from computer science ended up doing all the work. During the first round of the competition, one of the medical students didn‚Äôt even show up, and the other two just sat around while we worked hard to get the project done. We ended up doing well and advanced to the second round.

After the first round, the member who didn‚Äôt show up left the group, which meant we had to find someone to replace them since the team needed 6 members. I managed to recruit a replacement at the last minute. In the second round, the remaining two medical students once again didn‚Äôt contribute anything, but we still did well and advanced.

As we prepared for the third round, I realized we‚Äôd need to put in more effort to win, and I felt that having two non-contributing members was holding us back. I spoke to one of the medical students (let's call her Sofia) and explained that the upcoming rounds would involve more work and travel. She said she couldn‚Äôt join because she didn‚Äôt have the money to travel (even though the university was covering all the expenses). I didn‚Äôt correct her, because, to be honest, I wanted her and her friend out of the group.

I tried contacting the other medical student (Ava), but she didn‚Äôt pick up. So, I asked Sofia to reach out to her instead. Later, Person A told me that she couldn‚Äôt get in touch with Person B and that she probably wouldn‚Äôt be interested in joining either.

I decided to remove both of them from the group and started searching for replacements. After finding one person, the Ava medical student messaged me saying she doesnt want to leave. At this point, I lied and told her all the spots were filled, even though there was still one spot left.

52,1ff43uc,WIBTA for refusing to allow my daughter a friend because of my grudge,"TW: Bullying and Depression

Past context: I was very heavily bullied as a teen. I had no friends through school and was a target to many. I am currently 30 and still struggle with feelings of worthlessness stemming from this. While there were many bullies, one in particular was relentless, Rachel. Rachel was from another school, was two grades above me, and had never met me before when I received my first message from her online. The message was vile, she said that I was repulsive, fat, ugly, etc, but I was used to recieving messages like this and didn't respond. I then began to recieve daily messages from this girl, telling me that the world would be better without me, detailed steps about what she thought I should do, etc. I blocked her, but she just made new accounts and continued these messages urging me to do dangerous things every single day for over a year. While bullying as a whole had lasting impacts on me, her messages were some of the worst and most persistent I ever received and I still can't bring myself to delete them 

Now: This morning while taking my kids to school, my daughter (5) asked me to walk with her to her classroom. While we were walking to the door she noticed a friend and ran to say hello and introduce me. I noticed instantly that the mother with this child, was Rachel. I genuinely felt like I was going to throw up, cause a scene or cry so I continued quickly with the drop off and left. 

I have never seen this girl in person before today and have not heard from her in years, but it brought me back immediately to the year long torment I experienced from her. My first concern, as trivial as it may sound, is that my daughter's birthday party is coming up and we always invite everyone, as I don't like to make any child feel excluded. My daughter has also mentioned this girl specifically to me as one of her best friends in the class, though this is only their second week knowing each other. 

We are handing out invitations on Monday of next week, and I'm completely torn on what to do about this girl. On one hand, she is innocent and is my daughters friend. I would never want to cost my child a friendship or make her feel singled out from her classmates because of my own drama. On the other hand, after a little digging, Rachel is not only still a terrible person online but is also a single mom, meaning that if she accepted the invite SHE would be bringing her daughter to the parry. 

I also don't know if I could handle the entire situation maturely and absolutely don't want to end up in a screaming match or worse at my child's party. I can't stop going back and forth in my mind and don't think my thought process is sound right now. I don't want to put my daughter into an uncomfortable situation.

She said ever since I moved in that she wants to teach me how to drive and she wants no one else to do it. It‚Äôs been almost 3 years now and she hasn‚Äôt once teach me how to drive. I‚Äôm always talking to my grandma (60s) about all that‚Äôs happens but I think she doesn‚Äôt believe me because my mom‚Äôs husband is really nice to her and my brothers and how even as a kid I never liked cleaning. I kinda like cleaning but I‚Äôm tired of cleaning up after 3 grown ass adults that are more then capable of cleaning up after them self‚Äôs. My grandparents (my grandma that I talked about earlier) keep saying how I can come and move in with them but I don‚Äôt want to because both of my brothers live with them and they are just making it by. I tried a few time to talk to my mom but she keeps telling me that she is ‚Äúworking‚Äù on getting her husband to be nice and all I have to do is play nice. Also I really want to get one of the kittens that my younger cousin has but I can‚Äôt have one at my grandparents house and my mom won‚Äôt let me get the kitten. I know I‚Äôm kinda leaving out information and quite a bit of it but I don‚Äôt really have time to put all of it here. I‚Äôm sick and tired of staying with my mom. I‚Äôm going to talk to her this Sunday(09/15/2024) about everything and see what happens, if we get in a fight then I‚Äôm moving in with my grandparents, and I‚Äôll be leaving that day or the next day and leaving my phone and tablet so she can‚Äôt talk to me, if we talked about it and she said things will change I‚Äôll give her 2 weeks, if things don‚Äôt change then I‚Äôm gone.

I really liked this idea because I was cleaning a lot more at my dads house and I would get a dog at my moms house.

58,1ff2w0z,AITA for asking my dad to stop telling me how much a higher power helps him?,"Hey guys first time positing here!

I grew up in a moderately jewish household (not orthodox or anything  but went to synagogue, had a bar mitzvah and celebrated most holidays). Over the years I've been staying true to being culturally religious but more agnostic than anything else regarding god or a higher power. My dad used to ask me a bunch of I believed in god or not and would try to start arguments about it pretty often. Regrettably, I would also get a little heated and argue back.

Eventually the arguing stopped and whenever he asked me I tried to emphasize that I love and support him no matter what, and mostly would try to just avoid those confrontations all together.

More recently he hasn't really asked me about it but whenever we talk he tells me how much god has helped his life. I just kidna nodded and said I'm glad it's helping him. It got a bit more aggressive though and I tried to set up a boundary. I basically told him that although I'm happy that he's found that community for himself, but it made me feel uncomfortable because of our past discussions.

He agreed to this initially, while telling me that it was ""my problem not his"" that I felt uncomfortable. After a few weeks instead of not talking about it, he now starts all his sentences with, ""I know you don't want me to talk about this but..."" and continues like he did before. I haven't yet asked him to stop again, but I probably will again the next time.

On one hand I do feel uncomfortable when he spends a few minutes talking about how much he loves god. On the other hand I should be happy that he's happy and it doesn't at all impact my life.

60,1ff2mua,AITA for telling my mother she won‚Äôt be invited to my college graduation?,"Recently, I have been constantly arguing with my mother over my college advances, hurtful things have been said. Out of the blue she mentioned being excited for my college graduation, something about it just made me snap. I told her she wasn‚Äôt invited, but it‚Äôs not like she‚Äôd care anyways since she skipped my high school graduation. She was dumbfounded for a moment before starting yet another screaming match.

For context, in my country high school graduations don‚Äôt get huge celebrations. Some fancier schools rent special halls to host solemn roll calls for their graduates, so my school decided to do this. We were told a month prior that a celebration would be held, but the reservation was done last minute so we didn‚Äôt know the time and place until a week before the event. 

I told my mother about my upcoming high school graduation a month in advance, but couldn‚Äôt give her the time and place until a week before. I let her know as soon as I got the information, but she told me that she had a meeting with a friend planned for the same day. I asked her to please reschedule. She said that she‚Äôll see what she can do, but that it was important. According to her it was work-related, but she didn‚Äôt specify. 

At the day of my graduation, when I got to the hall in the afternoon she was already there, looking kind of mad and impatient. Our seats were separated for the convenience of getting up later and collecting the diploma on stage. The speeches were dragging out quite a bit, but the school board organized small musical numbers for entertainment of the guests. Finally, the moment of handing out diplomas came. My name was called and I got up to join the rest of my class on stage. I was really happy, until I looked at my mother‚Äôs seat. It was empty, she left without a word. I was holding back tears throughout all the pictures. When I got back home my mom was already there, drinking coffee and gossiping with her friend. I ignored them and went to my room. For the rest of the evening I heard them laughing until the friend left. 

Finally, she took interest in me and asked to see the diploma. I asked her why she left before the handouts. She said that I knew that she had an ‚Äûimportant meeting‚Äù with her friend, so she left to meet her, and that the speeches were boring and dragged-out anyways. I was too exhausted to make a fuss at this point, so I just said ‚Äûok‚Äù. 

Going back, between the screams I told her that it‚Äôs her fault for missing my first graduation, she made her choice and she doesn‚Äôt deserve to see the second one.

Kate and I were together for 3 years and then we broke up. A few months later Kate asked if we could get back together and still loving her at the time, I said yes. We were back together for 2 months when I found out she had started seeing another guy while we were broken up and she was still with him while we were back together. I told Kate it was over and I wasn't going to play around with that kind of shit and she knew I had watched my parents doing that crap. Kate's then-boyfriend/now-husband is James. James had no idea we got back together until Kate's best friend told him. This was after I had broken things off with her again. Then Kate found out she was pregnant and had no idea which of us was the father. I told her we needed to do a DNA test. James said no we don't and he'd be the father regardless. He proposed while Kate was pregnant. She said yes. But they weren't married when my son was born. Kate asked me to be in the delivery room with her and she told me she sort of knew I was the father. This pissed James off who was not in the room with her and she sent him to work. It was messy. I think she wanted us to get back together when our son was born. But I never entertained the idea.

DNA proved I'm the dad and Kate and I went to court to figure out custody. James hated it. He hated me instead of Kate for cheating. He hated me for choosing to stick around and parent. He called me selfish and said my son could have grown up in a simple two parent home instead of a broken home from the start. He engaged in a lot of alienation back then and for about a year I was given custody of my son while Kate and James had to attend classes and therapy. James did calm down a little and 50/50 custody was reinstated. James still hates me though and he can't be around me. Kate and I keep all contact via app.

Kate and James struggled to have children together and lost three. Their son was born 2 years ago with severe disabilities. During that time my son started to explore different activities he wanted to do and joined a couple of clubs that offered a more relaxed experience to sports and allowed parents to be involved. I was the only parent involved in that. Kate didn't want a part. James was jealous again and my son told me James wanted to go instead of me but my son wanted me there instead. So I continued taking him. About two weeks ago James approached me and wanted me to be less involved with these activities so he could be. He said we should share them and I should let him have one. I told him that was not going to happen. he started getting loud so I moved away from him and carried on with what I was doing. James then sent a long email calling me selfish and saying I know his only bio kid will never get to do this stuff so I should be sharing my son with him better and how my son doesn't call him dad despite being around since before he was born and blaming me for that.

66,1ff03n5,AITA for having my neighbor‚Äôs cars towed from my garage?,"My house is being built in a neighborhood that‚Äôs a few years old. My lot is one of the few remaining lots and there are occupied houses surrounding mine. The exterior is basically complete and the contractors are in the process of putting up the drywall. After work the other night, I decided to drive out to inspect the work. Everything looked fine until I decided to check out my garage. When I opened the door, I saw 2 cars and a minivan parked INSIDE my garage. I called the contractor to see if he knew anything about them and he was as perplexed as I was.

My guess is that one of the neighbors decided to park their cars inside my garage because there was a slight chance of hail that night. At first I was just going to leave it alone but the more I thought about it the angrier I got. By the time I got to my car, I was steaming mad. So much so that I called a tow company and had them tow all three vehicles away.

The next morning my contractor called and told me the police was there to investigate the theft of the vehicles. I had them put the police on the phone and explained that I was the owner of the property, had the vehicles towed, and gave them the tow company information. My contractor told me later that the owners of those vehicles were shouting and cussing them out until the police made them leave. I went by after work and a guy confronted me about being as ass for having their vehicles towed. He was shouting about how I ruined their day because they missed work and their kids were late to school because. He also said it cost almost $1,000 to get all 3 vehicles back and that I‚Äôll be covering the cost. I told him good luck with that and that he‚Äôs the ass for parking in my garage without my permission. We went back and forth until his wife came and pulled him home.

Some of the other neighbors came out to watch our argument and afterwards some of them told me I was starting off on the wrong foot and should apologize to that guy. They said that I should be more neighborly and understand that neighbors help each other out. One said that I should have left a note instead of having them towed. It seems all my neighbors are against me.

I can see their point so maybe I overreacted? I‚Äôm not sure.

They had been planning this move for several months and had their house up on the market before they told my husband (24m) and me (23f). They had mentioned the name of a small town they liked and were considering their #1 choice of location. I know the place well because it's my home town. And I fled right as I was turning 17 and never went back there. There are zero happy memories of my home town for me. I was raised in one of ""those"" families. The ones that are the talk of everyone in town for all the wrong reasons. I'm the only member of my family (dad, mom, brother) who did not go to prison or get in trouble with the law. But people still hated me because of who my family was. Growing up there was hell. And the one friend I had back then got a lot of shit for being friends with me. Teachers treated her like shit, she was thrown under the bus alongside me many times. Even her family gave her crap for being friends with me.

When all three family members were arrested together I decided I just needed to run away and get far from there or I'd live in literal hell until I turned 18. And I knew it would happen.

My ILs always knew I came from a family that got in trouble with the law a lot. They also knew I had a bad reputation where I came from as a result. They didn't know my home town until that came up when they mentioned their move and I gave them a friendly heads up/warning that living there and making their association to me known would not be a great idea. That they would likely be treated poorly as a result. My husband suggested there were so many other places they could look at. But his parents had their hearts set. My husband and I worried for his much younger siblings who are all still in school. I knew most, if not all, my past teachers would still be there. But I had hoped they wouldn't be too open about me.

They moved in June. By August they had mentioned me to some people or some people had seen photos of me and my husband in their home. And when my siblings in-law started school... it wasn't great. They found it hard to make friends, one BIL was denied a place on the football team. Parents don't want their kids associating with them. They also noticed neighbors are less friendly, they don't get the same chitchat they liked when they first moved. And they heard a lot of hate about my family. The kids especially.

68,1fezc2p,AITA for accidentally letting a boy in the room while my friend was naked? ,"My class went on a school trip and we were staying in rooms with 3-6 people. I was in a room with my best friend and two other girls. The showers and bathrooms were not by the rooms but down the hall and my best friend went there to shower and walked back to our room with just a towel wrapped around her. 

When she was in our room she put it away and went up into her bunk bed to get dressed I guess. I dunno what she was doing up there bc I was in the bed under hers but she had enough time to put on a shirt. We always hung out with the kids from the other rooms and our door was never locked unless we locked it when we wanted to change but she didn't do that. 

Then someone knocked on the door and I just said ""yes"" automatically and a boy from our class came in and saw my friend without a shirt and immediately closed the door again. I didn't really think before answering and I didn't think she would still be naked either.

She got really mad at me and insulted me and went to stay in another girls room. Our teacher came too and I explained to her and she wasn't mad at me. The other girls from our room were on my side too bc I didn't do it on purpose and it was also her job to lock the door when she wants to change like we all do too. I apologized but she didn't talk to me for the rest of the trip and didn't talk to me in days now even after we got home. She acts like I did it on purpose because I wanted to embarrass her and that's probably what she told the other students as well but it's just not true. I think it's not worth losing a friendship over but idk she doesn't seem to forgive me. AITA or is she being dramatic? I would forgive her too right away bc it was an accident. 


Edit: I'm sorry if it sounds like I'm saying she can't be upset bc ofc she can be and I would be upset too about a boy seeing me naked. I'm just saying I wouldn't be this mean to her about it or try to get the whole class to be against her for something she didn't mean to do. 

Another edit: I never said to my friend that she can't be upset about what happened and I didn't immediately react trying to defend myself, I just apologized. Only in the post I defended myself like that because she's also being unfair.

So my sister texted the woman and she said it could be dropped off early.

My mom essentially volunteered me to drop it off since it was on my way home. I picked up my husband on the way because he had a few drinks after work with friends and was being responsible. When he saw the cooler in the back he looked in it and was extremely grossed out seeing the frozen placenta. After some discussion he also made me realize it was really disrespectful to him and I to rope us into this because he has very strong beliefs in god. There was also hygiene and health concerns my husband brought up.

It got to a point where it was either he was going to get out of the car and walk, or the placenta needed to be out of the car.

I offered to cover the deposit she put down with the woman who was going to process it, and I even got her a gift card to the witch store she likes to get some herbs and stuff to do the ‚Äúritual‚Äù she wanted, despite it being against my values.

70,1fez0g3,AITA for setting boundaries with my friend/housemate?,"I 23M live with my housemate 23F who I‚Äôve been friends with for a long time. We have little to no boundaries. Generally, we‚Äôve gotten along well, though we‚Äôve had a few minor disagreements in the past. Recently, however, I‚Äôve been getting more and more frustrated with her behavior, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm being unreasonable.

Here are the main issues that have been bothering me:

- Milk Sharing: We‚Äôve been sharing milk to make things easier. I buy it, then she buys it, and so on. But recently, I‚Äôve been the one buying it twice in a row, and when it was her turn, she asked if I could take some from my workplace (basically steal it) because she forgot to buy it. It was early in the evening, and she easily could‚Äôve gone to the store herself. This rubbed me the wrong way, especially since it feels like she just expects me to cover it, by stealing it from work. 

- Bills: We recently had to pay a shared bill, and I ended up putting in a little extra because I didn‚Äôt have exact change at the time. Instead of putting in her full share, she saw that I‚Äôd overpaid and thought it was fine to contribute less. It wasn‚Äôt about the small amount of money‚Äîit was about the assumption that I‚Äôd cover her without her asking me first. 

- Fridge Space: We have two fridges‚Äîshe takes up one, and the other one is left to me and the other housemate. Lately, she‚Äôs been using space in the shared fridge without asking, which means I often don‚Äôt have room for my groceries. I ended up taking her stuff out and putting my own in, and I think she‚Äôs annoyed by that. I just don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs fair that she‚Äôs taking up space in another fridge when she already fully occupies another. 

All these little things have added up, and I decided I needed clearer boundaries to avoid getting resentful. I told her this morning that I want to stop sharing groceries like milk and that I‚Äôd rather we each handle our part of the bills separately. I also brought up the fridge situation and asked her to stick to using her own fridge. 

I think this actually took her by complete shock, she thought my reasons for being upset/annoyed were extremely minor and pathetic. She told me I was being nitpicky and overreacting to things that weren‚Äôt a big deal. She said that none of my concerns warranted the situation and that she wasn‚Äôt bothered to continue being friends. Essentially, she just didn‚Äôt understand my concerns, whether that was a lack of communication on my part or a lack of understanding on hers. I tried to be as clear as possible. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling conflicted. On one hand, I think I have a right to feel frustrated when these things build up over time. On the other hand, I‚Äôm wondering if I was being unreasonable or if I should‚Äôve just let these things slide. 

I think if anything, this is just a lesson for me for the future to set boundaries early on, so stupid petty things like this don‚Äôt create resentment over time.

Generally, we‚Äôve gotten along well, though we‚Äôve had a few minor disagreements in the past. Recently, however, I‚Äôve been getting more and more frustrated with her behavior, and I‚Äôm wondering if I‚Äôm being unreasonable.

Here are the main issues that have been bothering me:

- Milk Sharing: We‚Äôve been sharing milk to make things easier. I buy it, then she buys it, and so on. But recently, I‚Äôve been the one buying it twice in a row, and when it was her turn, she asked if I could take some from my workplace (basically steal it) because she forgot to buy it. It was early in the evening, and she easily could‚Äôve gone to the store herself. This rubbed me the wrong way, especially since it feels like she just expects me to cover it, by stealing it from work. 

- Bills: We recently had to pay a shared bill, and I ended up putting in a little extra because I didn‚Äôt have exact change at the time. Instead of putting in her full share, she saw that I‚Äôd overpaid and thought it was fine to contribute less. It wasn‚Äôt about the small amount of money‚Äîit was about the assumption that I‚Äôd cover her without her asking me first. 

- Fridge Space: We have two fridges‚Äîshe takes up one, and the other one is left to me and the other housemate. Lately, she‚Äôs been using space in the shared fridge without asking, which means I often don‚Äôt have room for my groceries. I ended up taking her stuff out and putting my own in, and I think she‚Äôs annoyed by that. I just don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs fair that she‚Äôs taking up space in another fridge when she already fully occupies another. 

All these little things have added up, and I decided I needed clearer boundaries to avoid getting resentful. I told her this morning that I want to stop sharing groceries like milk and that I‚Äôd rather we each handle our part of the bills separately. I also brought up the fridge situation and asked her to stick to using her own fridge. 

I think this actually took her by complete shock, she thought my reasons for being upset/annoyed were extremely minor and pathetic. She told me I was being nitpicky and overreacting to things that weren‚Äôt a big deal. She said that none of my concerns warranted the situation and that she wasn‚Äôt bothered to continue being friends. Essentially, she just didn‚Äôt understand my concerns, whether that was a lack of communication on my part or a lack of understanding on hers. I tried to be as clear as possible. 

Now I‚Äôm feeling conflicted. On one hand, I think I have a right to feel frustrated when these things build up over time. On the other hand, I‚Äôm wondering if I was being unreasonable or if I should‚Äôve just let these things slide. 

I think if anything, this is just a lesson for me for the future to set boundaries early on, so stupid petty things like this don‚Äôt create resentment over time.

71,1fexqh6,AITA for making a weird comment during a movie.,"Posting from a burner so my friend (hopefully doesn't see this). I (M25) am incredibly shy when it comes to talking. Most of my (few) friends either stem from school or work, and just the thought of trying to talk to someone random makes me clam up. Because of this, I sometimes lack social cues and feel like I can come across as either crude or creepy. I think I ran into an instance of this when a work friend, I'll call him Mike, invited me to his place for a movie night. Me and Mike are big film nuts, and in particular we both tend to lean towards horror films. The movie that Mike (M22) wanted to watch was Terrifer. For anyone who hasn't seen that movie, it is incredibly gorey and brutal with its kills. Mike informs me that his girlfriend (F23) who I'll just call Gail, was gonna watch the movie too.

Well, we're watching the movie, and eventually it gets to the most infamous kill in the movie with Art, the killer clown and mascot of the franchise, sawing a girl hanging upside down in half. As the scene goes on and I look to the side and notice that Gail is looking a bit uneasy and trying to not pay attention to the kill. I honestly felt kinda bad, because the scene is definitely uncomfortable, so I tried to lighten the mood by saying something stupid.

So as the kill is finally finished, and Art is showing off his kill, I say ""Man, I've heard of scissoring, but this is really something else.""

Gail doesn't really laugh at it but gives a bit of a smirk so I returned it. Mike however gave me a weird look, and the rest of the night he just felt really cold towards me. The night became a little bit awkward after that and I left back to my place soon after the movie ended.

When I woke up the next morning, I got a message from Mike saying that I was being ""really fucking weird"" for making that comment and that I ruined the movie for him. I texted back an apology but he didn't respond. During my shift whenever I caught Mike in passing or in the break room I felt him actively trying to avoid me.

AITA for making a comment like that during the movie? A part wants to apologize to Gail now because I don't know if after I left she told Mike something about what I said or not, Mike himself didn't mention her reaction but I feel like he might not want to get her involved?

72,1fexkx5,AITA for kicking my old friend out of a wake?,"Since school most of my friend have moved away and we're not really close. I only have one friend from school that I was still in regular contact with. We'd often go out for drinks and just meet up to catch up. Earlier in the year he stopped replying to my messages then eventually apologised and just said he wasn't talking to anyone currently and that he was going through something. 

I accepted that and told him I was here if he needed me. I then saw multiple photos of him on nights out so it was clear he was lying to me. He was out with people I know and one of my cousins who I don't talk to. 

Two weeks ago my mum passed away. She was the last close family member I had and I didn't know what to do. I knew he'd been a bad friend but I just hoped he'd reply and be there for me so I messaged him asking if he would meet up as I've just got some awful news and could do with seeing a friend.

I heard nothing back from him. The funeral was yesterday and we get to the pub I've booked out for the wake and he is there while my cousin is sat crying. My cousin hasn't seen my mum since she was around 2 years old yet was trying to make the day all about her. 

He comes over to me and asks how I've been and says he was sorry to hear about my mum. I told him if he was that concerned he'd have replied to the message I sent instead of just leaving me on read. I said the wake is for people to remember my mum so he can get out since he didn't know her. 

He said I was being unfair but I just repeated to him to get out. He said he was here to be supportive but I just told him he missed his chance to act like a friend. I asked the bartender to get security and get him out since Id booked the place and it was only for the wake. 

My cousin asked her dad (my mums brother) to get me to back down. He told me my old friend is staying and I just have to deal with it. Other family members tried to side with me but my uncle just said the old friend is staying and to just move past it and that my mum would be ashamed that I'm starting a fight at her wake. 

My friend told me to calm down but I just told him  again that he's not welcome here so to get out. Security listened to me as I was the one who had made the booking and they escorted him out. 

My uncle said I should be ashamed at myself.

73,1fex9r6,AITA for expecting to spend time with my friend after I traveled to her country,"So I (27M) have been friends with 'Cathy' (23F) for a few years. Purely platonic, in case it matters. She spend a short time in my country for her study, which is how we initially met. We hung out a lot during that time, and even after she went back to her home country (South Korea), we kept in touch pretty much daily. During this time, she would always say how I should visit her sometime, asking me when I'd be able to visit, how much I'd enjoy her country, etc.

So a few months ago, we finally made plans for me to visit her, and two weeks ago I traveled halfway across the world to visit her. In the weeks leading up to that, she'd kept saying to hurry up and come.

Now that I'm here however, I keep feeling like she doesn't actually want me to be here. She's acting like I'm an inconvenience, and with everything we're doing, she says she's just doing it for my sake, not because she wants to. She told me she just wants to rest and how it's annoying that I can't do anything myself. But I feel like that's to be expected. I don't know the language, I don't know the culture, and I'm not even anywhere near a touristy area so nobody around speaks any English (not to mention I'm very introverted, which she knows). 

I told her I came all the way out here because I wanted to spend time together at her suggestion, so we could make some nice memories and have fun experiences. But apparently she just wants me to do most things alone. It's making me wonder why I even came at all.

75,1fewwln,WIBTA if I dropped a class because of someone in my project group?,"I (24M) am currently taking a university module with a friend , V (21F). We are in a group with 3 others (1 of her friends, 2 strangers)

I met V through an internship. During the internship, we got to know each other better through trauma bonding and I then saw her as a friend instead of just a colleague.

Recently, I heard from another friend that someone asked V about her impression of me. She replied that she thought I was a creep, and that I made her feel uncomfortable.

I was shocked. Through my time with her, she didn't show any obvious signs of discomfort being around me, initiated some times and was always amiable.

There were 3 main incidents that she cited:

1. I told the office that I sent her off at the airport, even though I didn't arrange this with her

2. I told the office that I planned to go to the same winter exchange together with her

3. I didn't plan to take the same class as her but somehow ended up there

I realised that all of these were misunderstandings:

1. Instead of the office planning a farewell for her (she ended 1 week ahead), she was asked to work extra unpaid over the weekend to finish up a urgent deliverable. WORSE, she had to camp overnight alone at the airport as her lease ended a day before her flight back to her home country. 

All the interns felt bad about her situation and tried to make her last day better. I discussed with them and said that I would see if I could leave work on time (we were expected to OT everyday) to accompany her at the airport for awhile. I asked her if she wanted to have dinner but she said that she was already meeting a friend, so I left it at that. HOWEVER, I still left early that day because I could not stand working at that company any longer but I didnt tell anyone in the office I went home instead so they assumed I went to send her off.

2. I was asked if I was going on exchange. I said I was going to Korea, which also happened to be same place that V was going to. Someone asked ""are you going with V"" I said ""Ya I guess?"" but I never said that I PLANNED to go TOGETHER with her.

3. Tbh was a blatant lie on V's end.

I then confronted V, asking if I could defend myself. She told me that she didn't care, and that I didn't need to ""correct"" her impressions of me. She said that we weren't close enough friends that she gives any weight to the things that I do, and that she sees me as a ""normal"" friend and colleague.

While it did hurt for a while, I did see where she was coming from, so I told her I'll be accountable for my mistakes.

I then told her that I'm considering dropping the class because I didn't feel comfortable around her. She replied that I would be irresponsible and a dick move. Given the circumstances, I feel I still have the right to defend my feelings and distance myself from someone who I thought was a trusted friend. I'm very conflicted about whether I should drop the class or finish it with her.

77,1fewtte,AITA for refusing to watch photos/videos of a family member's wedding? ,"I heard the grapevine that one of my first cousins on my dad's side (his sister's child) was getting married. Apparently it had been planned for months, but neither I (30F) nor dad and I got an invitation. Another uncle(her uncle as well) did get invited and went to the wedding out of town, but we were clearly snubbed. 

No one including this first cousin's siblings (my first cousins as well) said anything to us  - we only heard through word of mouth from other extended family members. Keep in mind that my dad has a huge family of about 9 brothers and sisters plus their children, etc.

I saw this cousin last year when I attended her dad's funeral, and we've talked periodically since then. As a child, she used to visit us and we always took her around, hosted her, etc. So I'm not a stranger to her. 

She has a reputation for being selfish and spoiled (not the good kind - disrespectful and demanding), so when I found out that I wasn't invited - I was like ""screw that then""

I don't have any issues with her otherwise but my extended family can be mean spirited at times. 

My other aunt was invited to the wedding and told months in advance, but couldn't make it.

The day after the wedding, and she messaged me saying that she will send me the wedding video link. 

Apparently, a YT video link was created for streaming...but my cousin nor her mom or anyone planning the wedding called to give us an invite or tell us about the date. 


I sitting here thinking ""I wasn't invited, so why are you sending me a link to sit and watch a wedding that I was excluded from?"" 

I got mad and told her - ""Thank you for reaching out to me but I'm not interested in viewing the wedding"". 

Then she told me ""Ok, I know its still a difficult time for you, I will send you photos instead""

Its not a difficult time for me per se, but ever since my parents divorced, there's been a pattern of me being left out of family events and gatherings even though I live in the same area as most of them. It's neither here nor there, but I've moved on for the most part with my life and career. 

Then I told her - ""My storage is quite full, I don't want photos either""

Isn't it kinda weird and rude to send photos/videos of a wedding to a family member who was clearly not invited?  

Wtf was my aunt thinking? She knew my dad and I weren't invited because we told her beforehand. 

I don't feel entitled to be a guest at anyone's wedding, yet if I'm not invited or wanted there AND treated as an afterthought, I don't really care to engage or have anything with the couple.

My mom thinks I shouldn't have said anything and let it go, but I think I had a right to stand my ground.

AITA? 

Edit: Thanks for the input. Tbh, I'm not mad - just confused as to why my aunt (not the mom of the cousin who got married) is trying to ""include"" me - I think her actions were a bit insensitive, that's all.

If I knew a friend or a family member was not invited to an event, whether on purpose or not - I wouldn't send videos or photos of the event to them.

78,1fewn2o,AITA: am i the asshole for refusing to go with my best friend to her boyfriends place at midnight while she‚Äôs drunk?,"So, this happened last night, and I‚Äôm feeling really conflicted. My best friend (23F) and I (24F) were out at a party, and she got *super* drunk. I was mostly sober (one mixed drink) since I had work in the morning, so I was keeping an eye on her per usual since she‚Äôs a hardcore part girl

At around midnight, she started insisting that she wanted to go over to her boyfriend‚Äôs place. For context, they‚Äôve been having some issues lately‚Äîlots of arguing, and she‚Äôs even told me she‚Äôs unsure about the relationship. she also has a horrible history of drunk driving. she‚Äôs never been in an accident while drunk which has boosted her confidence to think she‚Äôs GOOD at driving drunk. i‚Äôm extremely against drunk driving and she knows that. Her boyfriend also wasn‚Äôt at the party, and she hadn‚Äôt mentioned wanting to see him earlier in the night. 

I tried to convince her to just not go, but she got upset, saying I wasn‚Äôt being a good friend and that she ""needed me"" to come with her. I was uncomfortable with the idea of her going over there drunk, especially since she wouldn‚Äôt let me drive and would have made me sit in the car the whole time they fought.  Plus, it was *midnight* and I didn‚Äôt feel like it was a good idea for her to confront him when she wasn‚Äôt in the right state of mind. 

she said if i didn‚Äôt go with her she‚Äôd just go by herself to which i responded ‚Äúfine i‚Äôll just be here.‚Äù i‚Äôm tired of arguing with her and im tired of her making bad decisions and begging for my help when shit hits the fan. she ended up not going but now, she‚Äôs barely speaking to me, saying that I‚Äôm a bad friend for not supporting her when she needed me. I honestly just didn‚Äôt want to enable her to make a decision that could lead to more problems, but now I feel like i could have approached it differently.

so, AITA for refusing to go with her to her boyfriend‚Äôs place? Should I have just gone to make sure she was safe, or was I right to stand my ground?

79,1fewa3d,"WIBTA if I didn't let one of my DnD players bring his girlfriend into the group, but brought my partner in?","I(30s) run a weekly game night with 5 other people (mid 20s, mix of m+f). This has been an ongoing game night almost every week for about 4 years now, but I've known most of the group for closer to a decade. 

One of these players, A, is... a special case. He often doesn't pay attention while I'm describing a scene or explaining combat, despite 4ish years of playing and knowing him, he still doesn't seem to understand some of the basic mechanics of the game and doesn't try to. He's also often flaky and will just not show up to games sometimes without telling anyone.

The reason I'm making this post though is because of A's influence on the group. He is the only one in the group that is not in a long-term relationship, and has had 3 different GFs in the time I've known him. Every time he has a new gf, he wants her to join the dnd party. I want to be 100% clear: I do not have a problem with teaching people how to play, or adding players to the group. One of my favorite things about being a GM is teaching new people. But the issue will come up when the gf has been a part of the party for a while, I will have dedicated some story interaction to her character, and then she and A will break up and she leaves the group. It disrupts the story/the rest of the party's interactions with the story, and makes things awkward for all the rest of us. Add to this he always seems to get involved with someone he's living with, so then it puts his living situation in jeopardy and causes stress in that way.

Well. GF #4 is in the picture, and I'm dreading the idea of going through the rigamaroll AGAIN, making a new character, inviting a new person into the fold, only for A to shit the bed AGAIN and throw off the party balance again. 

The rest of the group seems like theyre becoming annoyed by A's normal antics (one of my players was practically yelling at him last week), but im still I'm nervous to bring it up to the other people in my group. They are friends with A outside of our weekly game night, and I'm worried I'm in the wrong here. I'm also worried I'd be in the wrong because I've been trying to talk my partner of 12 years into joining the group, and it would seem hypocritical on my end.

81,1fevrio,AITA for not moving out of my apartment?,"Last year, I moved into an acquaintance‚Äôs basement. I was looking for a new, affordable place because my residence at the time had increased in rent by over $500/mo since I had moved in a few years ago. I met my current landlord by doing some work for her (I‚Äôm a personal chef and catered a party for her). She offered up her basement in a house that she recently purchased because the house was empty and she thought part of the basement could be converted into a functional kitchen, which I could use for my work. 

The only caveat: I‚Äôd need to share the main-floor bathroom with whoever moves in upstairs because it would be too expensive to install one downstairs, and the main-floor resident would need to share a washer/dryer unit that currently resides downstairs with me.

Fast forward to now, I‚Äôve enjoyed living in this space because I can work out of the downstairs kitchen. But this landlord has had a difficult time finding a main-floor renter because everyone who‚Äôs toured the space has been unwilling to agree to the shared space (bathroom/washer/dryer). The most recent prospective renter just fell through for this reason and my landlord was very unhappy. She asked to meet and expressed her displeasure, stating I was the reason she‚Äôd been unable to find another renter and that several prospective renters had declined when they learned they‚Äôd need to share the house with me. 

(Side note: I met the most recent person who toured the space. I showed him the downstairs washer/dryer he‚Äôd be sharing. I mentioned we‚Äôd probably discuss possible arrangements for sharing the washer unit if he decided to move in. Apparently, he told my landlord that the main sticking point for him was the shared washer/dryer issue - he didn‚Äôt want to walk through someone else‚Äôs rented space every time he needed to use it.

She said that negotiating a sharing arrangement should only happen between her and the renter. I told her I never actually tried to negotiate a sharing arrangement and apologized if what I said might have been interpreted differently.)

Recently, my landlord has hinted that she‚Äôd be willing to terminate our lease early and has used more aggressive language than normal during our communications.

Without realizing, he had invited my cousins and their family on of all days, the day I turned 20.



I couldn't do anything about it and had just hoped that they would leave as soon as possible, I didn't even want to share that it was my birthday. One of my cousins, in the past, had sat me down during a dinner and talked to me for over an hour about church and how it would help me. I am not religious but back then I had tried going to church two separate times over the course of months, it just wasn't for me and I had accepted that fact. But she forced me to promise her to go to church with my mother (who is not over religious) and would not settle for my answer of ""I'll try"".



But it didn't stop there. She went on to talk about my weight and appearance, how I'm not feminine enough and that I should slim down. Now I'm not someone that I would pretty or handsome, I'm chubby and had acne at the time, but I was comfortable in my body. I was already going through stress in school, I had issues at home that she was somewhat keeping up with, and I suffer from depression and anxiety. Her statements were the straw that broke my back, adding that insecurity on top. She compared me to my own mother, saying that she was proud when her children go on diets when they think they're gaining fat, and even mentioning her biological sister being overweight. Afterwards, my self image was severely compromised and I stopped eating for a while, I was in a spiral for a month but somehow managed to recover.

Afterwards, we had dinner outside and I noticed my nieces (F20 and F25) were gone for a long while, so I was hoping that they weren't getting me something.



However, one of my biggest fears came true when at the end of the dinner they asked for the cake and sang the birthday song to me in public. I'm already anxiously socially as it is, I'm not comfortable with such things unless it is with my closest friends and I never wanted to draw attention to myself like this.

I'm also not comfortable in front of cameras but they were asking for photos and videos, even asking the staff to do it for us so this is extremely embarrassing for me. Am I ungrateful and an a-hole?

My girlfriend of 6 months has friends who are mostly guys, guys she used to have relationships with. Internally I can be possessive but I understand these people were friends, and had short relationships that were better off as friends.

The other day she had one of these men over to her house and didn‚Äôt say anything about it to me, went as far to hide it from me for a couple days. 

She came to my house in the morning while I worked and just relaxed in my bedroom. She found my own shirt in my bed and assumed somehow I was cheating. I‚Äôm not btw.  Got mad and left, went and hung out with this guy at her house. 2 days later she is making big decisions like moving to another state. Im a bit taken back by this. She wants to move to the crappiest part of the Midwest with her parents. All of a sudden. Big change. We live in the desert now. While I‚Äôm upset about this change she tells me about how this guy came over 2 days ago. The day she left my house upset.

She says they did nothing but play Skyrim and he was only there less than an hour. 

I don‚Äôt feel like I can trust anything she says or does now?

I have a friend, let‚Äôs call her Tiffany, who was dating Brad for five years. Tiffany was absolutely in love with this man. Every time she spoke about it him was always in high regard. Every time we were on the phone or at dinner there was always at least one time point in the conversation she would bring him up. I generally didn‚Äôt mind because in all regards their relationship seemed healthy and no extreme red flags. Brad treated her very well, he was in therapy, and paid for all their dates, outings, and vacations. 

Fast forward five years of dating and he finally proposes. Tiffany never suspected anything but decided to post on one of those ‚ÄúAre we dating the same man‚Äù Facebook groups and that is when the truth comes out. Turns out Brad has FOUR different girlfriends and allegedly had a wife in his home country of India. Now, where he had all the time for this I have no idea but once Tiffany found out the truth she was devastated. 

For three straight months after the breakup all she could talk about was Brad. You could come to her with a problem and she would still find a way to relate it back to Brad. 

For a long time I patiently listened to her vent since she was clearly grieving but at some point it got annoying.

Now this may be where I am the asshole because I quite bluntly told her that Brad didn‚Äôt love her.

88,1feuyu3,AITA for kicking my uncle out of ‚Äúhis‚Äù house?,"I (23M) was very close to my grandfather, who passed away last year. He left me his entire estate, including the house after my grandma divorced him. Before he passed, my grandma had asked him to let her son (my uncle, 50M, not biologically related to my grandfather) rent the house. They set up a 3-year contract for $1800 a month, and at the end, he could buy the house for $377K. The contract ends this November.

After a lengthy probate process, the house is now officially in my name. My uncle asked if I‚Äôd extend the contract because of high interest rates, but I didn‚Äôt want to‚ÄîI'm hoping to buy my own home soon. My grandma pressured me, saying ‚Äúit‚Äôs family,‚Äù so I reluctantly agreed to extend it for 3 more years.¬†

While I was waiting for a new contract to be drafted, my uncle asked if he could start construction on the house. I said no, but then a friend of mine (who was doing the work) told me that my uncle had already started construction without my permission. I went to check it out, and sure enough, major work had been done without permits. I confronted him, and he denied it until I showed him photos. He claimed it was ‚Äúhis house‚Äù and that he could do what he wanted.

Later, during a family holiday, my uncle and his girlfriend ambushed me, proposing a 5-year contract with lenient rent terms, no restrictions on construction, and permission to sublet. I refused and said I‚Äôd have my lawyer draft the contract instead. During probate, my uncle and his girlfriend discussed what they would prefer contract wise that left it more open-ended. I continuously listened to their wants; however, I told them in the end I would send them a contract drafted by my lawyer once the house was in my name.¬†

A few months later, my uncle, his girlfriend, and my grandmother sent me the 5-year contract they had proposed during the family holiday. I firmly declined. My grandmother then called and berated me for not signing, claiming that if it weren‚Äôt for her, I wouldn‚Äôt have inherited anything from my grandpa. At that point, I lost my temper and said, ‚ÄúYou have to be f\*cking kidding me.‚Äù She responded, ‚ÄúYour grandpa would be disappointed in you for using that language with me.‚Äù I replied, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt use my grandpa against me,‚Äù and hung up.

Since then, my grandma and uncle have cut me off. I had my lawyer draft a new contract: 3 years, no subletting, and a clause requiring my approval for construction, the rest of the original contract (from my grandpa) is the same. Now my uncle is saying he can only qualify for $350K instead of the $377K he owes, and my family is pressuring me to accept the lower offer, accusing me of forcing him out.

He's been nothing but kind and caring to me. The one thing I ask is that he doesn't send sexual or sexually suggestive texts to me. Usually, if he wants to meet up, he will say ""I'm coming to pick you up."" The reason I ask him not to send suggestive messages is because my phone does not have a lock on it and living with my parents and younger siblings, they go on my phone (with my permission) for a number of things. I do not want to have to explain myself to my parents who are very religious and believe that I should save myself for marriage. Nor do I want to accidentally traumatize my siblings who are young and impressionable.

However, after our most recent hookup, he sent me a message saying how good it was.

She lost her shit. I'm 22 and should have every right to do what I want with my body but this isn't an acceptable thing in our religion.

- he has never done therapy and is avoidant about talking about his feelings with me (one of the reasons he‚Äôs in therapy). My therapist said it would be beneficial to him to have a male therapist as this is a common problem for men. I recommended that to him and he instead found (and stuck with) a female therapist. 

- he has fallen back into the same habits (that we agreed he needs therapy for) despite being in therapy for around a year or so. 

- he claims he doesn‚Äôt know what to talk about because he‚Äôs never done therapy before. While I understand, I do think that a good therapist should push you in the direction to at least doing some self-reflection. 

- we had a big fight recently that culminated in me admitting my feelings to him that she didn‚Äôt seem like the right match. He confessed that the last few sessions have felt like ‚Äújust conversations.‚Äù (Proving my point that she doesn‚Äôt push him in the right direction to talk about the traumas, relationships, etc.) 

We left it at he would have one more session with his therapist outlining the things i told him I have yet to see progress on and see how it went from there. He didn‚Äôt tell me until tonight (his session was a couple days ago) she hesitated to give him a couples therapist recommendation and even suggested herself! My own therapist has told me that a couples therapist should never be one of the individual‚Äôs therapists to prevent any conflict of interest, but I would‚Äôve felt off about this even before having that validated. 

I‚Äôm ready to tell him that he should find a new therapist asap as this seems to have crossed the line completely for me. He feels like he doesn‚Äôt want to start over with someone new because he wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable.

95,1feu077,AITA for being jealous and annoyed at my best friend being close with someone I dislike,"I (M25) met my best friend (F20) a year ago at our university. The two of us were part of a trio with another girl until she blocked and left us for no reason. So it was just the two of us ever since. We've always been together and we were inseparable and thick as thieves.

By the end of the schoolyear, we both promised to make new friends this September. Last week, we became closer with an old friend (20M) and met two new students (19F and 17F). So now there's 5 of us.

I became friends with the former but I dislike the latter. She is rude, nosy, arrogant, tactless, entitled, and judgmental. She would sometimes butt in on personal conversations, answer sarcastically when asked a question, and speaks in a condescending tone to me. I also don't appreciate how she judges me and downplays my personal problems when she wasn't even in the conversation to begin with.

I was really irritated this afternoon when she interrupted a conversation between me and my crush (22F) when she corrected me about some personal information my crush told me that 17F doesn't even know about.

I am very annoyed that my best friend is getting close with her. She is being affectionate and very nice with her and she would sometimes ask me to even help 17F which I begrudgingly do. They only met 9 days ago. I voiced my concerns to my best friend but they she didn't feel the same way.

97,1fet98s,AITA for refusing to help out a friend who got scammed?,"Recently my Instagram account got hacked. It's an account I use to post random stuff so I don't log in often and browse mostly on my personal account. I found out about the hack from a friend who said he saw me post about ""How I turned $500 into $15,000 in just 1 day!""

Apparently their modus operandi is to post about a ""finance coach"" who can help you convert your capital. If you're hooked, that ""coach"" will ask you to transfer money over. If you are doubtful the ""coach"" will ask you to message your friend (i.e my IG account which is already hacked) to share their ""real life story"" The ""friend"" will share screenshots of bank statements, stock earnings, crypto etc to show ""proof""

Friends who are closer to me will probably know that I would never post anything like that. I'm not into finance or crypto at all. My stories are basically just food and scenery and random fun things that I buy. I had a long battle with Meta to prove that the account was mine but they kept denying me access and rejected my appeal. Eventually I just gave up and conceded that the account was lost.

About a week ago, I received a message from an old friend asking me when was the last time I saw returns on my investments and usually how long it takes for ""coach"" to get back to them. Then he attached screenshots of his transfers to the coach which amounted to over $16k. He was even asking if he should transfer more so that he can get his returns back quicker.

Long story short, he realized he got scammed and made a police report. Thought that was the end but he sent me a message asking me to bear some of the costs. He first told me how badly he was affected by the loss. Then he said he was going to go into debt. And then he started piling the blame that if he never followed my account, he wouldn't have gotten scammed. He asked me for 25% to help him out as it was partially my fault.

I said I know it's a big sum that he lost but I can't help him with that as firstly, money is pretty tight and also,  I don't have any control over the account and sent him the screenshots of my conversations with Meta. Things got quite messy and he threatened to file a police report against me.



Is it my fault that my account that caused him to get scammed? I feel like I have no obligation to give him any money and I suppose he will probably hate me for it but we're not too close so I suppose that doesn't matter. I would prefer to not have a police report to be filed against me or anything to go on my record that I'm involved in a scam. Not sure how that will affect future background checks, house applications or loans.

102,1fesh5o,AITA for not putting my Grandma in my Father's Obituary?,"Just a week and a half ago my father, an Iraq war disabled veteran, passed away tragically at the age of 40. Since then our family has been arguing on whether or not his Mom, my grandma should be included in the Obituary.

For starters, my father always told me and my siblings and step mom how much he hated his Mom and how she had abandoned him at a young age. She had never been present in his life short for a few times when he was younger. He also had issues with her always trying to be the center of attention, making his life and achievements about her when she barely contacted him.

So when it came time to discuss his obituary, My Siblings and Step-Mom decided that he would not have wanted to give her the credit of Mom in the Obituary.

Since then his Brother had told us it would be the right thing to do and that she deserves a place in the Obituary and alongside him trying to convince my grieving step mom she (my dad's mom) also messaged her wondering why she was not included.

Once they had both done that I decided to get them together in a group chat and explain that we would hear no further from them about the topic and that our decision is final. We wanted to respect what we believe are our fathers and my step mom's husband's wishes.

My Uncle ended up leaving the group chat angry and I blocked her and the kids she chose my dad over.

That was yesterday and when we woke up today we found that she created her own obituary excluding his Brother by choice that we had decided to Include and his military friends. Her description of my father was untrue and false as she had not spoken to him in depth in almost ten years. Her daughter/ his sister created it and had had issues with me my sister and my biological mom in the past on our comments of our grandmother's absence in our lives, especially my youngest brother who is 9, who has never met her.
 
I also put out a facebook post informing friends and family of the situation with the real obituary and told them not to follow theirs as it was not an accurate description.

His Mom and sister are planning on attending and I am unsure after everything if me and my sister/ stepmom will be able to keep calm with them attending the funeral. The funeral also public so we will not be able to keep her from coming, but we are worried they will start drama during the hardest time of our lives.

I'm usually the one who does all the driving even though we both bought the current car. (The previous car was mine outright) She doesn't drive much and never got another one after her last one was totaled when she rear ended someone 5 years ago.

The last time she drove was like 3 months ago and she drives like 5 times a year.

When we got to the car, she said she feels bad making me drive all the time and said she'll drive. I told her I don't mind driving but she insisted so I let her.

Everything was fine but then when we got to the mall parking lot she misjudged a turn going too fast and crashed the front corner of the car into a pillar and didn't brake in time.
We have a tesla so it is quite expensive to fix.

To make things worse instead of just getting back into the car and parking elsewhere and dealing with it, she made a scene standing outside the car crying and drawing attention to us and people were staring, some even taking pictures.

We got back in the car, with me driving and I told her this wouldn't have happened if she just let me drive and that we aren't making that mistake again. I feel this is true but she got upset and called me an ah and said it can happen to anyone and she says she still wants to drive more.

I did what she told me to and then she just got mad for no visible reason and took my phone. Of course as any sane (or insane) teenager would get annoyed at this. She told me to fold the clothes in 30 minutes. I did that. The video I had playing in the background while I work was only 10 minutes long. (I will link it in an edit if needed)



Then she proceeded to just tell me I didn't do any work at all and said to look at my room which I literally only had a few clothes on my desk chair and I didn't make my bed. I was annoyed but decided to get back to school work. She decided to make me mad by saying its all my phone's fault and that I shouldn't have it. I got up and threw my phone across the room (not my best moment but I was upset at the fact its always the phone's fault) It didn't break thankfully. My father asked where I got this behavior from and I told him to look in the mirror because he's smashed 2 of my phones already.

The second strike was that he said I could send the money through Cash app regardless if it‚Äôs $100 and the profile I saw was of a woman in an inappropriate outfit. Second strike.

The third strike came in when he asked me to still pay the money yet he wouldn‚Äôt show me a picture of the supplies that he said he was going to use it for. All he said was to give him the money and then he‚Äôll show me a picture of the materials.

I used to point out specific things that i thought he was lacking like looking down all the time while walking and talking. Initially he was always walking a couple steps behind me even i tried to slows down and match his pace. When i asked him about it (and other things) he used to be defensive and said he was never looking down or that it‚Äôs was awkward/gay to walk next to a person. On the later day he corrected the walking together thing.

My granddaughter 11f still wets the bed, it's a family thing on her moms side and it's not something I know a whole lot about. 

She wears pull ups for bedwetting called goodnites ( yes that's how they're spelled ) so her pee doesn't get all over things. 

When they were here one night and my daughter in law was getting my granddaughter ready for bed, I went in to say goodnight ( the door was open ) and saw her package of goodnites half empty sitting on the bed. 

She saw me and was quite embarrassed, she immediately tried to hide the package by throwing a blanket over it, but I knew she knew I had seen it. 


I wanted to make her feel better and I knew she was embarrassed but didn't want her to be. So I told her it's not bad or shameful to still need diapers ( I know it was stupid to call them diapers ), I told her that lots of people still have issues with not being able to control their bladder and mentioned to her that my friend who is my age wears depends because he can't always control his bladder. 

This didn't help and she just said "" okay "" and smiled at me awkwardly. By then I knew I wasn't going to make her feel any less embarrassed so I just left. 


Later that night my son brought it up to me, my granddaughter was very embarrassed by what I said and my son was pretty mad at me for embarrassing his daughter. He told me it was totally inappropriate to compare a little girls incontinence to an old man's incontinence.  I said I was sorry but I just wanted to ease her mind a little.

118,1feqc5l,AITA for complaining to my mother about her behaviour at an extended (wife's family) gathering?,"My wife (31F) and I (32M) were hosting a dinner for her birthday. Her family is Chinese and my mother is Chinese but definitely a banana (we're all immigrants in a western country), and we were eating at a local Chinese restaurant because it's the easiest option.

My parents have always had a difficult relationship with my wife's parents, who are a bit older and very traditional - my MIL doesn't speak much English and my parents don't speak any Chinese, but they're generally civil with each other.

My mother called as she's been feeling stressed about the large gatherings saying she feels like she's always walking on eggshells around my in-laws and doesn't know what to do. For big gatherings my in-laws like to go hard on seafood (lobster or crab) but my parents don't and can't really afford to tbh if they are hosting. My mother and younger brother (M28) are also a bit allergic to crustaceans (recent reactions - hives type allergy) so they try to avoid eating it but then feel bad when it's such a big part of the meal. She also feels like it's showboating from my in-laws (which might be partially true) but I tried to explain it's also the way they like to celebrate and it's only for big events, not just a casual dinner. Plus they don't expect my parents to reciprocate in the same way. I heard her out and discussed with my wife and we agreed to try and change the menu up this time to make them more comfortable. We were hosting (and paying) btw.

We explained in great detail why my mother and brother wouldn't have the lobster to my in-laws so they wouldn't feel offended. The night went well but both my mother and brother ate some lobster, which confused all of us.

Afterwards my wife was quite upset. It's an expensive dish and we all want to make sure there's enough for everyone so 2 extra people eating throws out portions.

I texted my mother the next day saying '\[my wife\] is a bit distressed from last night. You made a big point about being allergic to lobster but then had some anyway and now she's getting grilled by her parents because they're confused. If you want them to change or do something different that's completely fine but be clear about it and stick to it. Doing this has made them worried because we ordered assuming you and \[my brother\] wouldn't have any.'

My mother responded with a barrage of texts saying things like 'omg I was just trying to be polite, I had a bad reaction afterwards as well' and 'I thought it was such a great night, now this happens, I was trying to be so nice to everyone' and also angry I'd sent her a 'rude text' instead of calling and asking to never be invited to another gathering like that again. She also sent photos of both her and my brother's hives reactions from the following morning.

I've tried to respond by thanking her for all those efforts and I'm not trying to berate her, but she's done a lot to make my in-laws happy but then not thought about how this affected my wife at all on her birthday dinner.

120,1fepvvq,AITA for ignoring my now former friend?,"So I have a former friend, more of a drinking buddy. We were regulars at a bar where I usually hang out at.

I sometimes enjoyed hanging out with this friend, but he's bossy and doesnt take no for an answer. Even the first time we met he wanted to do a shot and I told him several times that I was trying to to get drunk and he ordered one anyway. There were several times I hung with his clique and if I was too quiet or constantly ask what's wrong even if I insisted there was nothing wrong. This friend was more extroverted than me and seemed to want to help me come out of my shell, but I told him this is who I am and I was good.

I finally got mad when one day I tried to say hi and he tried to teach me a secret handshake and he wanted me to get it EXACTLY right. He made me do it like 10 times until I got it right. I had told him I wasnt interested and he kept insisting and even during this spilled my beer and got frustrated, to which he responded ""that's your fault, you're supposed to do it this way, not that way."" After finally getting it right he immediately tried to teach me another one, so I decided I wasn't dealing with him anymore that day. Later that night he was poking me while I was trying to wash my hands and I tried to just ignore it, but he kept doing it until I turned around and he said ""You're ignoring me!"" with a wasted grin. I texted he we aren't friends anymore after I left, but changed my mind after saying I felt made fun of and he agreed to give me space.

Needless to say he didn't do it. Everytime he saw me at the bar after that he would come right up to me and say ""I still love you"" or ask if we were still friends. On the 4th of July. My friend was really wasted when he came in. I was going on stage to sing and he literally followed me on the stage asking if we're still friends and why I need space for so long. While I was I was singing my song he interrupted my song to talk in the microphone, then he followed me as I got of stage and continued to bother me. He insisted that I hang out with him and that hes a real friend. He asked why I wouldn't hang out with him and the people he was with.

She gives others second chances, but she‚Äôs too trusting with the people she gives second chances to, and it winds up having consequences for whichever family member Zoey convinces to stick their neck out for.



My grandparents were talking about needing a cleaner, and Zoey asked them to hire a friend Ash. After several months, my grandparents learned that Ash had been pocketing my grandma‚Äôs jewelry. Zoey had recommended Ash‚Äôs cleaning services for our grandparents‚Äôs friends, and now we suspect that she‚Äôs stolen from them too.



Zoey made an excuse that Ash was a good person but that she had a bad home life and only took the jewelry because she‚Äôs trying to get away from her parents. My grandparents were not amused and said Ash was lucky because that was the only reason that they didn‚Äôt report her.



Later, Zoey recommended a friend Lilly as a babysitter for our brother‚Äôs son ‚ÄúMax.‚Äù According to Max, Lilly was on her phone the whole time, and Max was on his own for dinner. Max claims that Lilly was actually mean to him, and my nephew isn‚Äôt the type to make up something like that.



Zoey made an excuse that Lilly‚Äôs boyfriend broke up with her and she‚Äôs a good person but just having a hard time. (I rolled my eyes at how a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù would ever feel better about herself by being mean to a child.) Michael was obviously pissed at Zoey for recommending Lilly.¬†



Zoey kept trying to push me to talk to him and agree that she was right. I eventually got fed up and told Zoey how I get she wants to give people second chances. But no one she recommends is ever trustworthy. And she should try putting her own neck on the line so she‚Äôll get why we‚Äôre so annoyed with taking the consequences of her kindness and then her coming and trying to make us agree that she did a good thing.



After that, our parents reached out to me. They said that they understood me and Michael being frustrated, and they would talk to Zoey about being naive. But she was trying to do a good deed. And I should apologize to her because, no matter the circumstance, it‚Äôs a crummy thing to put down a person who had the best of intentions.



One could argue that this is none of our parents‚Äô business, as we‚Äôre all adults now. But our parents typically stay out of our business. This is one of the only times our parents gotten involved in any of our disagreements, so now I‚Äôm torn between if I should apologize or hold my ground.

I started the GC.‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah I understand. I can add you back but can you please chill on the swearing just a bit?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou get annoyed because I say one thing but then there‚Äôs Gabe and Justin doing random bull crap and NO ONE thinks that‚Äôs annoying ‚Äú ‚ÄúLike I know they can be annoying but come on. You said multiple over the span of a couple days‚Äù ‚ÄúIf someone ASKED me to chill out I would‚Äôve. NO ONE said ANYTHING about it. And your solution is kicking me out. How nice. Because no one said to stop or anything. So how am I supposed to know you don‚Äôt like it if no one says anyways.‚Äù 

After this Emily messages me saying ‚Äú hi id just really appreciate it if you stopped bothering Christine multiple people made this decision not just her so could you leave her alone? thanks‚Äù

For the record, no one asked me to stop swearing and no one made it seem like it was a problem. If someone would‚Äôve asked me to chill on the swearing I would. But that never happened. If there‚Äôs this entourage of people who don‚Äôt like it, how come no one said anything? 

So I‚Äôd like to know. Am I the asshole for swearing in a highschool group chat? 
Ps. Fake names. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-12,"AITAH for swearing in a group chat?  I am in highschool. Last year on Snapchat we created a group of everyone in the class possible so we can ask questions and whatever so I decided to do the same this year. This year I made it. This is only our second week of school. 

I‚Äôve been sick this passed week so I haven‚Äôt been able to attend classes. I asked in the group chat what I missed in science. I got no reply. Later on, these 2 guys in the class started chatting which always goes the same ‚Äú ‚Äòhi Justin.‚Äô ‚ÄòHi Gabe‚Äô ‚Äòhow are you‚Äô‚Äù etc. it‚Äôs always like this. Today was no different. 

Right when they started saying hello Tina chimed in saying something like ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt. You can do this in a different chat.‚Äù They obviously ignored this and continued so I said ‚Äúfucking hell‚Äù. They continue this for about 5 minutes until suddenly I‚Äôm kicked out? 

Here is a copy paste of our conversation. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck. Why‚Äôd you kick me out. I MADE the gc.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really appreciate the swearing and the beef. Sorry u don‚Äôt want to start trouble. It was just getting annoying.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou were getting annoyed AT ME? For WHAT?‚Äù ‚ÄúYa idk mb‚Äù ‚ÄúI asked ONE question. Gabe and Justin were being annoying.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just it seems like you‚Äôre starting beef with everyone in the gc atm like everything they say you swear at‚Äù ‚ÄúI asked ONE question. Did you kick Tina out too? She told them to stop. That sounds like starting beef.‚Äù ‚ÄúI mean I can add you back but like can you chill on the swearing please? üôèNo I mean it‚Äôs not just today it‚Äôs like all the time‚Äù ‚ÄúI ask questions because I‚Äôm not there and it‚Äôs annoying ?‚Äù ‚ÄúNo just the swearing.

My gf works a decdnt job in leasing consulting but whenever she gets paid she takes it as an opportunity to go spend money shopping or buying food without paying off her bills first. She has virtually no savings and is basically living from paycheck to paycheck. A couple of times now she has asked me for money because she forgot she had a bill to pay and had already spent he check on other bills or shopping, it was concerning to me then but I lent her money. Today she comes asking me for 60$ because she forgot she had a bill to pay and accidentally spent her check already. I said no. I'm very good with my money and I try to save as much as I can so its frustrating to see someone so careless with there's. I've brought up to her that she needs to start doing a monthly budget to avoid stuff like this but she just blows it of and goes back to the same behavior. I'm at a point where I don't want to enable her anymore. AITAH or should lend her the cash?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-12,"AITAH For not lending my gf money?
