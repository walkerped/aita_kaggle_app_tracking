0,1ff3zyg,WIBTA if I never came out as trans to my family?,"TLDR; moving out for university and starting testosterone in secrecy, only telling my dad about it cus he supports me, dressing up as a girl when I visit for the holidays to avoid getting potentially disowned, but otherwise being a man online, at work, at school, etc. (will tell friends and future partner im trans)  
  
I'm 17, AFAB, currently living life as a woman.   
next year I'm planning on moving out for university, getting a part time over the summer + continuing the job in Uni, and starting testosterone in secrecy.   
  
So, my family found out about this a while ago by accident, and they were pissed to put it lightly. im not gonna elaborate... it's a long story that doesn't really matter. My family so far just assumed im over that 'phase' cause I've been doing okay living life pretending to be a girl. It's not come back up in convo, and its sort of an unspoken rule to not bring up anything about it.

Anyhow, my dad's pretty supportive, surprisingly. He said once I'm 18 I can do fuck all with my life, as long as its not drugs, satanic worship, or dropping out, which i wasn't planning on doing anyway.... lol so I'm probably letting him in on the secret when it happens.  
(love u, dad!)  
  
I wanna be as stealth as possible, so I'm gonna transition socially/physically once the affects of T have really kicked in, so I don't get clocked as easily. (deeper voice, fat redistribution, more muscle increase cause I work out and hopefully the T will boost the affects)

Anyhow, I was planning on wearing wigs and unbinding my chest when I'm around my family,  softening my voice, etc. since I don't really wanna be disowned by my mom again.  
If they find out, then they find out, oh well. I'll just have to deal with it.  
  
I've lived life so long being a woman, I wont fall over and die pretending again for a few hours or a couple days when I see my relatives every now and then. It's annoying, but I'll live, it's not the end of the world.    
My whole plan is fake it till the facade cracks. (cause realistically, it will eventually.)  
I'll deal with the aftermath later.   
Basically-- Man at Uni/Work, woman on holidays when I visit home.

My reasoning?

My family is sort of already the black sheep among our extended family, and I don't want to be the reason my extended family shuns them more than they already do, by being the only trans person in the family. I care about my family a lot, and I don't think my grandmother's heart can take it anyway.  
(also, im scared of my family disowning me in general, because I love them so much, and my biggest fear is losing them.)  


\*Also, I'm not a complete prick, I'd tell people I was trans if I wanted to get romantically involved. I'm not gonna pretend to be cis to a future partner... This isn't some freaky ass kink, And no, I don't wanna touch your kids and groom them into being a transgender alien... LMFAO please don't make this into a political thread.

dumb idea? WIBTA? I'm open to criticism. Thanks in advance. ",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-09-12,"WIBTA if I never came out as trans to my family?

1,1ff1mmh,AITA for kicking my friend out of my house?,"A few years ago, I (27 non-binary) offered to let my friend (27 m male) move in with me and my wife (27 female), because he was miserable where he was living, and we agreed he‚Äôd stay with us for a year or two until he had some money saved up. We paid for the plain ticket, helped him get a job, and drove him around since he didn‚Äôt have a car. 

We agreed on a rent price just to help out with bills and groceries. Everything seemed fine at first, but then he stopped helping out with chores, his room started getting more and more disgusting, and he‚Äôd leave trash all over the house. We talked to him about helping out with chores, and even offered to try a chore chart or something like that (we‚Äôre all pretty neurodivergent). Nothing would stick more than a week or two, and when we would talk to him about it, it ‚Äúwasn‚Äôt his fault that he couldn‚Äôt remember.‚Äù 

It was getting so bad that our whole house started to smell bad because he wouldn‚Äôt shower. We asked to know when people would be over, especially since he was on the night shift and would hang out with people while we were gone. But there were several times where we caught him lying about hiving people over without telling us. 

Finally, after few months ago, we told him it was time he at looking for a place to live outside our house. He found a place on eBay, moved out and a week later he was told he had to move out at the end of the month (it wasn‚Äôt exactly clear how legal everything was, but he didn‚Äôt want to do anything about it). A week after that, he got let go from his job. He was on unemployment and getting a severance package. 

We agreed to let him move in for a month, rent free, to try to get his feet under him, but only one month. We got it all in writing and everything. He was immediately as messy and gross as he had been, he never left the house, and he ate only takeout for all month. He kept telling us he was applying for jobs, but he never seemed to get any calls for interviews. Whenever we would ask if he wanted to move home, he yelled at us that we couldn‚Äôt force him to go back home. We let it go. We offered to pay for a plain to him get back to his home town if he wanted, but said that he still needed to out by the end of the month. Well, the month passed, and he didn‚Äôt have a plan. 

He refused to buy a plain ticket home (due to car troubles we couldn‚Äôt afford it anymore) because he didn‚Äôt have any money and he couldn‚Äôt take all his stuff on a plain by himself. We offered to ship anything back that he couldn‚Äôt take. He didn‚Äôt like that. So finally my wife told him that he needed to call someone and find a place to go, and he refused to leave. They had a screaming match, he refused to call anyone, and ultimately he ended up going to the homeless shelter near by. It‚Äôs been a week since then, and his parents just came and picked him and his stuff up. They didn‚Äôt talk to us ask they picked up his stuff.
