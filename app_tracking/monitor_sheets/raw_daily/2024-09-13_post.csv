0,1ffxz0f,UPDATE: AITA for walking our dog while my wife was getting ready for dinner?,"Hello! I feel weird updating, but I have good news, and want to share somewhere, and here seems as good a place as any, right now. And, actually, I wanted to thank everyone for commenting, and the people who reached out privately with advice. You really helped me calm down, and figure out how to approach talking about this while seeing where my wife could have been coming from. One person even called exactly what was going on, something I dismissed right away, stupidly. 

So, I came home the next day and brought home pizza from her favorite spot in town, which we never get because of crowds, because I figured even if I wasn't outright wrong, there was no reason not to make the conversation nice.

So after dinner, I asked about the dog again, and after a lot of back and forth, and crying that I'll skip explaining, she explained that for the past week or so she had been feeling weirdly emotional, and she couldn't explain it. Some people had mentioned some things here about different health stuff that could cause those sorts of symptoms, and I got pretty nervous and got her in at her Doctor's office within a couple of days.

Well, imagine our embarrassment walking out five minutes after getting in and doing a test we could have done at home, for like, twenty bucks, without including insurance companies. (She is going to talk to her therapist about meeting every week for a while, while she adjusts/deals with hormonal changes.) 

We've been laughing about it now because never crossed our minds she could have been pregnant. Someone commented it, but I still didn't believe it, because I am dumb. Never mind that we're both in our twenties or that she switched birth control like two months ago, and we may or may not have had unprotected sex during the switch week. Anyway, as stupid as we may be, we are still excited but waiting until the Twelve-week mark to tell our families. 

However, I've been itching to tell someone and can't wait any longer. So here's an update, haha. (Wife-approved, because it's anonymous.) Thanks again for the help, I appreciate it a lot, even if I didn't take the advice of the person who was right.",UPDATE,2024-09-13,"UPDATE: AITA for walking our dog while my wife was getting ready for dinner?

1,1ffl6h0,Update: AITA for inviting my nephew to my wedding despite his estrangement from my brother?,"I decided to follow some of your advice and talk to him about what happened and set some boundaries with my brother, so I saw him in person to talk things over. I told him that my nephew has been in my life for more than half my life – I was 14 when he was born. I’ve been his uncle for 19 years and fundamentally *he’s* not the one that betrayed my brother, and while I can’t imagine what must have been going through my brother’s head at the time, it's not my battle to fight and even if it were I’m not obligated to take it out on a kid who had nothing to do with it. What he said was extremely shitty, yeah, but we’re talking about someone who was 14 at the time and absolutely did not have the emotional maturity to handle the situation. I told him my nephew was open to a mutual apology. So, bottom line, my nephew is invited and he’s getting a plus one, and I will seat him away from my brother if he wishes but that’s the most I will do. They can talk or not talk, kiss and make up or ignore each other all night, but I’m not making it my fight.

My brother said he understood and would think about it… then a couple days later he drunk texted me a complete 180 and asked if I could invite ex-SIL, too, which I think is probably because his RSVP included his new girlfriend as his plus one and she’s 26(?) I just know my niece complained it was gross that her dad’s new girlfriend was a year closer to her age than his. My brother at his best is charming, confident, looks-wise kind of like a chunkier version of me so not bad looking, and he had no trouble pulling women post-divorce once he got his confidence back and lost weight. I declined his drunk request, but his girlfriend is nice and I told my niece that GF is inside the half-plus-seven so she can’t be *completely* grossed-out.

Since some have asked about my nephew and ex-sil, I’ll explain: She didn’t know for sure that my nephew wasn’t my brother’s, but she strongly suspected and she *was* sleeping with both her AP and my brother at the time. For about a year after the divorce my nephew would throw the deception back in her face every time she reprimanded him, until I sat him down and pointed out that the more people he pushes away the fewer people he has in his corner when things go south. Bottom line she *is* his mother. After the debacle with my nephew my brother and ex-sil were more careful with my niece and the twins about not making adult problems their problems as well. Sorry there was no scarlet A like many of you would have liked. She’s not my favorite person but I can sort of tolerate her.

To answer the question about his biodad, my nephew has expressed zero desire to meet him. He says he doesn’t get why people think a perfect stranger could replace my brother like being abandoned out of the blue never happened.

My nephew RSVP’d yes and is taking his “theyfriend” (his SO is nonbinary and that’s what they’re calling themselves.)

So, finger crossed a happy ending.",UPDATE,2024-09-13,"Update: AITA for inviting my nephew to my wedding despite his estrangement from my brother?
