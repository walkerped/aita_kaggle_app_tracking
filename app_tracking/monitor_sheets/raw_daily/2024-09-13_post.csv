0,1ffxz0f,UPDATE: AITA for walking our dog while my wife was getting ready for dinner?,"Hello! I feel weird updating, but I have good news, and want to share somewhere, and here seems as good a place as any, right now. And, actually, I wanted to thank everyone for commenting, and the people who reached out privately with advice. You really helped me calm down, and figure out how to approach talking about this while seeing where my wife could have been coming from. One person even called exactly what was going on, something I dismissed right away, stupidly. 

So, I came home the next day and brought home pizza from her favorite spot in town, which we never get because of crowds, because I figured even if I wasn't outright wrong, there was no reason not to make the conversation nice.

So after dinner, I asked about the dog again, and after a lot of back and forth, and crying that I'll skip explaining, she explained that for the past week or so she had been feeling weirdly emotional, and she couldn't explain it. Some people had mentioned some things here about different health stuff that could cause those sorts of symptoms, and I got pretty nervous and got her in at her Doctor's office within a couple of days.

Well, imagine our embarrassment walking out five minutes after getting in and doing a test we could have done at home, for like, twenty bucks, without including insurance companies. (She is going to talk to her therapist about meeting every week for a while, while she adjusts/deals with hormonal changes.) 

We've been laughing about it now because never crossed our minds she could have been pregnant. Someone commented it, but I still didn't believe it, because I am dumb. Never mind that we're both in our twenties or that she switched birth control like two months ago, and we may or may not have had unprotected sex during the switch week. Anyway, as stupid as we may be, we are still excited but waiting until the Twelve-week mark to tell our families. 

However, I've been itching to tell someone and can't wait any longer. So here's an update, haha. (Wife-approved, because it's anonymous.) Thanks again for the help, I appreciate it a lot, even if I didn't take the advice of the person who was right.",UPDATE,2024-09-13,"UPDATE: AITA for walking our dog while my wife was getting ready for dinner?

1,1ffl6h0,Update: AITA for inviting my nephew to my wedding despite his estrangement from my brother?,"I decided to follow some of your advice and talk to him about what happened and set some boundaries with my brother, so I saw him in person to talk things over. I told him that my nephew has been in my life for more than half my life – I was 14 when he was born. I’ve been his uncle for 19 years and fundamentally *he’s* not the one that betrayed my brother, and while I can’t imagine what must have been going through my brother’s head at the time, it's not my battle to fight and even if it were I’m not obligated to take it out on a kid who had nothing to do with it. What he said was extremely shitty, yeah, but we’re talking about someone who was 14 at the time and absolutely did not have the emotional maturity to handle the situation. I told him my nephew was open to a mutual apology. So, bottom line, my nephew is invited and he’s getting a plus one, and I will seat him away from my brother if he wishes but that’s the most I will do. They can talk or not talk, kiss and make up or ignore each other all night, but I’m not making it my fight.

My brother said he understood and would think about it… then a couple days later he drunk texted me a complete 180 and asked if I could invite ex-SIL, too, which I think is probably because his RSVP included his new girlfriend as his plus one and she’s 26(?) I just know my niece complained it was gross that her dad’s new girlfriend was a year closer to her age than his. My brother at his best is charming, confident, looks-wise kind of like a chunkier version of me so not bad looking, and he had no trouble pulling women post-divorce once he got his confidence back and lost weight. I declined his drunk request, but his girlfriend is nice and I told my niece that GF is inside the half-plus-seven so she can’t be *completely* grossed-out.

Since some have asked about my nephew and ex-sil, I’ll explain: She didn’t know for sure that my nephew wasn’t my brother’s, but she strongly suspected and she *was* sleeping with both her AP and my brother at the time. For about a year after the divorce my nephew would throw the deception back in her face every time she reprimanded him, until I sat him down and pointed out that the more people he pushes away the fewer people he has in his corner when things go south. Bottom line she *is* his mother. After the debacle with my nephew my brother and ex-sil were more careful with my niece and the twins about not making adult problems their problems as well. Sorry there was no scarlet A like many of you would have liked. She’s not my favorite person but I can sort of tolerate her.

To answer the question about his biodad, my nephew has expressed zero desire to meet him. He says he doesn’t get why people think a perfect stranger could replace my brother like being abandoned out of the blue never happened.

My nephew RSVP’d yes and is taking his “theyfriend” (his SO is nonbinary and that’s what they’re calling themselves.)

2,1fg8vhj,AITAH for telling my work friend to limit certain jokes from me and that I want to set boundaries bc we’re work friends only?,"To give context I was getting lunch with my male co worker. We get along pretty well. I am a single woman and he’s a married older man with kids so sometimes I do worry if that could be an issue. Not necessarily on my end but I don’t have male friends so this is new for me. I’m the past they’ve always tried to make a move. But bc this is work and we don’t hang out, outside of work I don’t think of him as an actual friend. 


Anyway, we were driving from lunch and he was commenting about my driving and I said “oh is that why you looked like you were clutching your pearls bc I was going too fast?” we laughed and then he said “I like to give pearls… my wife loves them” it took me a minute to realize what he said but once I did it really surprised me and honestly I got a little embarrassed. Bc I didn’t want to know about his sex life. I know it’s a joke and if he wasn’t a work friend I actually wouldn’t be bothered by this. But it worries me that he will try crossing more boundaries.  

Anyway, later that day I tried to have a talk with him about it. I told him that I understand it’s a joke and everything but I’m worried of crossing boundaries bc we are work friends. And he kind of seemed upset every time I said we are work friend but we are. We never hang out outside of work. He doesn’t even have my number. I have his but I never text him bc why would I? I only see him at work. 


Plus… he’s a married man. I think it would look weird tbh. So I told him that I want him to continue being himself around me but to stop and think if a joke in a sexual manner would make me uncomfortable. He said okay and he understands but he looked really hurt. I told him i really don’t want to hurt his feelings but I swear I’m like this with everyone at work. He’s actually the only one I kind of like. It would hurt me if he wouldn’t want to be my work friend after this but also idk if he should be talking to me like that even if it is a joke.

3,1fg8ta2,AITA for not letting my son use his college fund for auto mechanic school and opening a garage?,"My husband died last year and it hit my oldest Carson (17M) really hard. They were always really close even after Carson came out a couple of years ago. Both of them had a passion for cars, bikes, and practically any motor vehicle. They bonded over it while they would fix and repair old cars and bikes and sometimes Carson's boyfriend Thomas(17M) another gear head would helpe out.

 Now initially Carson wanted to be a doctor like his dad. We even set up a college fund that would cover even medical school. We're almost a quarter into his senior year and last week he tells me that he doesn't want to go to college anymore. He wants to go to an auto mechanic school with Thomas and then open a garage with him. He ask me if Id let him use his college fund for that. Now his college fund isn't officially labeled as such so  theres no penalty for using it however but I want him to go to an actual school and really do something with his life. The kid makes straight As and is wicked smart he's getting athletic and academic scholarships.. I told him no and my reasons why.

He tells I'm not being fair trying to control his life like that. He yells at me that I can't force him to be a doctor. I try to explain that he doesn't have to be one but I want to him get an actual degree and make real money rather than probably getting stuck just fixing cars.

4,1fg8rpl,AITA for not paying a friend for shitty work (ethics) ,"My wife and I were expecting a son in May and had home improvement projects to finish before his arrival. We asked my friend, Bob, who’s a carpenter, to renovate our stairs. I had a budget of $1600 and estimated it would take three full days of work. Bob agreed to $50/hour off the books.

From the start, things went wrong. Bob couldn’t clean the stairs of glue and paint and suggested more expensive options, like oak veneer overlays that would’ve blown our budget. We finally agreed on thin plywood, though it wasn’t ideal. 

Bob’s work ethic was terrible. He was late on the first day, I had to call him awake at 2pm as he overslept for the second day, he called in sick on the third, and said he had to visit his dad after dad broke his leg. The job, which should’ve taken a few days, dragged on for three weeks. Meanwhile, my wife’s pregnancy was becoming complicated. One day, she started feeling nauseous and bleeding, so I rushed her to the ER. My wife is a thyroid patient and her meds have a slightly higher chance of premature delivery or late miscarriages. Her OB/Gyn warned us and advised us to come in to the ER if these symptoms would arise. I informed Bob that we had to rush into the ER and explained him what the OB/gyn had warned us about. He knew that miscarriage or premature emergency cesarean could be realistic outcomes. While we were there, Bob kept complaining over text that the other contractors in the house were making it hard for him to work. I told him to continue and that I would pay him for his hours but also reminded him that if he would've finished within the initial timeframe it wouldnt be necessary. But my focus was on my wife and unborn son’s health and I kindly told him I had more urgent matters to be concerned about. Bob quit the job, saying it was my problem now.

I ended up finishing the stairs project myself in three hours with a heat gun and chemical stripper—something Bob said wouldn’t work. Painted it the day after in two hours. When I sent him pictures, he accused me of rubbing it in. I was furious and confronted him about how he was acting like a true narcissistic cunt while I was in the ER worrying about my wife and sons lives. Bob turned it around, claiming I didn’t respect him as a professional and didn’t create a good work environment.

After our son was born, Bob sent me a bill for $1500, claiming he worked 34 hours. My records showed he only worked 18 hours, so I asked him to justify his claim. He delayed, and after months, he finally sent me his hours. By then, I already decided to pay him the actual expenses for the materials and 300 the few hours he worked and move on. I will transfer this amount to his business account so he has to file taxes over it and will be left with already less than he got which is already much less than he demands. 

My wife and sister think I’m being too harsh, suggesting Bob may be struggling with addiction or mental health issues again, which 37 year do you need to call out of bed at 2pm asking him where the fuck he is as we agreed he'd start at 9am. While I understand their concerns, I’m done with Bob’s excuses and unreliability, especially given how he acted during one of the most stressful moments of my life. I will transfer the said amount with the description ""Grow the fuck up, Bob"". Yes it might sound a bit childish and spiteful, but fuck Bob. 

AITA for not paying Bob in full and fucking him over by proxy of the tax office?

6,1fg8fd9,AITA: my gf’s cat loves me?,"My gf adopted her cat for her anxiety before we met and started dating.

Her cat started following me around in house nowadays. He(cat) tries to cuddle with me when I’m on my desk or I’m couch.

I thought she was cool with it but, in this morning, she went off really toward to me with anger/frustration. And I got text below:

""He got adopted by me, not by you. He helps with my mental health, not yours. Is it even possible for you to consider about others? that would be great. I’d appreciate it if you could remember that he is my pet, not yours.”

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA: my gf’s cat loves me? My gf adopted her cat for her anxiety before we met and started dating.

Her cat started following me around in house nowadays. He(cat) tries to cuddle with me when I’m on my desk or I’m couch.

I thought she was cool with it but, in this morning, she went off really toward to me with anger/frustration. And I got text below:

""He got adopted by me, not by you. He helps with my mental health, not yours. Is it even possible for you to consider about others? that would be great. I’d appreciate it if you could remember that he is my pet, not yours.”

7,1fg89wn,AITA for Staying Close with My Son’s Ex-Fiancé and Worrying About Future Grandchildren?,"I’m in a bit of a complicated family situation and could really use some advice. My son (32M) had an on-and-off relationship with his fiancée, Bethany (31F), for years. About four years ago, during one of their breaks, he met Marcy (33F), and they ended up having a baby—my first grandchild. They even got engaged and were building a life together. Then, while my son and Marcy were still together, Bethany reappeared, and eventually, things between him and Marcy ended.

Now, my son is engaged to Bethany, and they’re planning a wedding. I’ve stayed close to Marcy because she’s an amazing mom, and we’ve built a strong bond. I believe my granddaughter deserves to feel loved and supported by everyone, despite her parents not being together. I want her to grow up secure and not feel pushed aside because her father is starting a new family.

But here’s where it gets tricky: Bethany feels uncomfortable with how close I am to Marcy, and my son is taking her side. He’s even been a bit disrespectful to me, which hurts because it feels like he’s prioritizing her family over ours. Bethany hasn’t outright said she’ll keep me from their future children, but I’m worried that my relationship with Marcy will affect how close I’ll be to them. I love all my grandchildren equally, but I don’t want to lose that closeness with my granddaughter just because her parents aren’t together anymore.

All I want is for my granddaughter to thrive and feel loved. But now I’m feeling stuck between doing what’s best for her and not alienating my son and his future family.

I'd arranged a ride to collect her and take her home, as I'm originally from the town she was visiting, but when they arrived they tried to charge her double, as they said they had to account for travelling back from a different town, which wasn't disclosed on the quote they gave me. 

My SO called me about this, and I told her to cancel the ride, and we would sort a different one. Soon after this my partner told me it was OK, and she had a different ride sorted. This is where the conflict arises. 

The ride my partner arranged was from a guy I didn't know of, coming from our town, to the town she was in, about a 20 minute drive, and picking her up to take her home at 23:00. 

I'd never heard of this person before, my SO said they were friends and spoke on Snapchat. We've been together for 3 years at this point, so I thought I was aware of all important friends.

I told my SO I was uncomfortable about this, but relented as I just wanted her to get home safely. However, this person then stayed at our house for an hour having a coffee, leaving around 12:00. 

I was in contact with my partner pretty much the whole time, and wasn't hiding my discomfort abouut this person I knew nothing of, leaving late at night to travel and pick her up, then staying for coffee as well.  

The next morning we had an argument, where I said it was strange I knew nothing about such a close friend who would travel late at evening to a different town to pick her up. Whereas she said it was nothing and they'd been friends for a while and I was being paranoid.

10,1fg730l,AITA for refusing to let my MIL and her autistic son be around my baby ,"I (23F) stand at 5”0 115lbs (keep that in mind it’s important) and I just recently had my first child with the love of my life (27M). When I got pregnant we lived apart from his mother and the rest of his family. When the finances got hard we moved in with his mother who is divorced from his father. My MIL always seemed like an angel up until I actually started living with her. She took care of her children, who are all grown might I add, she is honestly very sweet and caring to others, she’s always pays for people when we go out to eat,works multiple jobs to support her family, etc. My pregnancy was not easy but still very enjoyable. Our families were so excited for us to have our daughter and everything seemed perfect. My MIL has an autistic son. Let’s call him Levi (25M). Now it’s not Levi’s fault he’s autistic obviously but Levi is a very different kind of autistic than what I’ve met before. He is incredibly violent when he doesn’t get his way. Violent to the point I think he would kill someone without a thought of consequence or remorse. He would threaten people with objects such as knives, baseball bats, fishing poles, literally anything he could pick up. He would throw things at you for absolutely no reason with the intention of hurting you. He could be mad about anything in the world and somehow it’s everyone else’s fault and you must get him what he wants or show him attention, but all hell breaks loose if you tell him NO. He’ll throw rocks and other objects at us or at our cars outside whether you are sitting in the car or next to the car he doesn’t care. He actually smashed his sister’s windshield with a shovel and almost hit his sister which was scary for everyone. But that’s only the beginning of his tantrums. He’s a grown man who has seemed to get increasingly more violent overtime. Now again he’s autistic and he can’t help that he’s autistic but he likes to target women. Especially me when I’m alone. One day a while ago when I was pregnant he hurt me really bad when my fiancé was at work. I was in my room minding my business and he stormed into my room upset over something his mother wouldn’t buy him. When I asked him to leave and tried to close my door I was hit in the stomach repeatedly and slammed into the wall face first and belly up against the wall pregnant af. All of his body weight was against me and I couldn’t move (remember I’m small). He kept pushing and pushing me back against this wall I had to end up yelling for his mother who stood there and watched me scream but eventually got him off. For about an hour after that I had these horrible cramps and was balling my eyes out. I was beyond worried about the life growing inside of me…So I decided to go to the doctor I was told by MIL that I was being dramatic for going to the hospital and she later called my mother and told her he never actually hurt my stomach.. I went off! I didn’t for the life of me understand how she would be so self centered after watching me get hurt with her grandchild inside of me.  Especially because she stood there and watched me get beat up and didn’t help me at all. I was also told to lie to the doctors so he didn’t get into trouble. Now Levi has medicine that he is supposed to be taking that she refuses to give him because it makes him tired and that makes her sad. A while ago before my daughter was born I had a serious conversation with her about his behavior. Anytime he acts up I’m told to leave the house or go to my room. Which isn’t at all fair to me that a pregnant woman should have to be locked up in her room or driven out of the house especially now that I have a baby just because she can’t control her son. She told me she would put him on meds but months later that turned out to be a lie. The abuse continued and I had to leave. He gets aggressive because he wants something and she rewards him for his bad behavior so he constantly gets aggressive when he wants something. When we would come back to the visit the abuse would start again and I had enough. I told her if she couldn’t make this a safe environment my daughter would not be there and she shrugged nonchalantly. My fiancé loves his mother very much and tends to side with her more. Last time I went over to the house I was left there alone with him and he tried to stab me and my daughter. After that I told my fiancé it’s not safe for me and our son and if he can’t realize that I will leave. He says he agrees and we are his priority but I also know he says a lot to his mother when I’m not around like he is playing both sides. In my opinion MIL is selfish and couldn’t care less about me or my child’s safety because she favors Levi. Levi will always be her top priority but my daughter is mine. I want more than anything for my daughter to be around his father’s family but it’s just not safe and it will never be safe so AITA?

11,1fg6g8n,AITAH for not going to my friends bachelorette party and going on a birthday trip the weekend before? ,"

Hi everyone,

I listen to AITAH stories all the time on THT and find other people's perspectives super helpful so I wanted to write in to see if I'm in the wrong here. My friend Natalie F 29 is having her bachelorette party in a very expensive town about 6 hours from me. 

She asked me in the summer about going and at first I was down until I saw the house and the price. They booked a massive house on the water, didn't check the price with anyone and I felt they could've  found something smaller to cut cost for everyone. For context the house was $550 for 4 days and that doesn't even count the costs of everything else. So I took back my yes once I found out the costs which her MOH weren't really clear on. At first a lot of people said no so I was hoping they would find something smaller and lower the cost for everyone. They also made it seem like we had more time to get them the money but the week after the told us the plans they asked for the money. I felt overwhelmed at the time because I just got married in January and my husband and I were trying to save for a house. So I told her no I couldn't afford it and I thought she would just take that as an answer. 

After this her FH and MOH both reached out about paying for me and her wanting me to go but I didnt want to take any handouts. It's also the price of the whole weekend she had a lot of tours and dinners planned and the area is very expensive. She also told me someone dropped out and I could take their spot without paying for the house but again it was still about the cost of the whole weekend and taking off work it's a lot. 

For context, I'm not in the wedding, she wasn't in mine either and we're kinda close but grew apart after college as I don't see her as much. I didn't have a big Bach just a dinner, and I was happy with that. We recently did buy a house and it was a lot of money so I want to be smart with my money. 


Now this is where I might be the asshole. 

I did go away for my birthday the weekend before the Bach but my husband surprised me with a trip and I don't have a lot of family to celebrate with (both my parents died) so I like going away for my birthday so it's not a reminder that they passed. Now I feel like she's mad at me for going away for my birthday and not going to her Bach. She didn't wish me a happy birthday and I wished her a happy bach but she didn't answer. So Reddit AITAH?

English is not my first language, so I apologize in advance for any spelling mistakes. I (18) My brother (he’s not actually my brother, he’s my uncle, my mom’s brother. We grew up together, and I got used to calling him brother instead of uncle, weird I know, but it doesn’t matter) (32) and my mom (45). Today, I had an activity for a class at my school. They told me I had to be there at 7:30 AM, but the activity (which was a presentation on school violence) didn’t start until 10:30 AM.

Everything happened after the activity ended around 1:30 PM. I walked with a classmate to the bus stop to go home. I got off the bus around 2:00 PM, and at that moment, I decided to stop by a convenience store. I was using the calculator when my brother sent me a message saying “I’m on my way,” and I replied, “Where to?” I then put my phone away and wandered around the store to see if I wanted to buy anything else. Ten minutes later, I took out my phone again, and no lie, I had about 20 messages from my brother along with missed calls.

The messages were something like “Where are you?” “You’re a liar,” “Why aren’t you home?” “I’m going to cut you out of my life,” “I know you’re doing bad things behind my back,” “You disappoint me.” At that moment, I was like, “What?” I tried to call him back, but he rejected my call. Then he sent another message, “You have until 2:30 to get home or forget about me.” At that moment, it was around 2:20, and it takes me about 15 minutes to walk home. 

I should mention that my teachers told us to put our phones on silent, and I simply forgot that it was on silent. As I was leaving the store, my mom called me asking why my brother was so upset and told me we would talk later when she got off work. When I got home, he wasn’t talking to me. I tried to talk to him and clear things up, but he just pretended I didn’t exist. Even though he wasn’t responding, I kept talking to him about it, but he wouldn’t look at me or acknowledge me. So, I went to my room. After a while, my brother came into the room yelling at me (almost the same things he said in the messages). 

I tried to talk, but he cut me off. He kept yelling, and I was getting a bit annoyed by his attitude, so I said, “I had my phone on silent,” and he just went silent and started crying, telling me I was an ""idiot"" leaving the room. I need advice on what to do. AITA for telling my brother that I had my phone on silent and making him cry? I don’t know what to do, please help me.

* I think I should make this clarification, before the presentation began there was a brief rehearsal on how we would sit, basically instructions, my brother was there it was around 8 am, When the rehearsal was over he told me he would go to work, then we had to wait for the people who would arrive at the presentation at 10 am.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA for telling my brother that I had my phone on silent?

I need advice on what to do. AITA for telling my brother that I had my phone on silent and making him cry? I don’t know what to do, please help me.

* I think I should make this clarification, before the presentation began there was a brief rehearsal on how we would sit, basically instructions, my brother was there it was around 8 am, When the rehearsal was over he told me he would go to work, then we had to wait for the people who would arrive at the presentation at 10 am.",0.0,0.0503460243344306,0,1
13,1fg5xc9,AITA For Selling The Gift My Ex Got Me,"I (27M)moved from the USA to England in 2020 to be with my (at the time) fiancee(29F). Since I arrived we had trouble making ends meet. For the first year I was here I wasn't even legally allowed to work since we were waiting on my visa getting approved. The lockdowns, money troubles, and other factors led to her becoming distant from me and by December of 2022 she broke up with me and asked me to move out. 
Now, while we WERE together we got each other gifts all the time; it was a pretty loving relationship. One of the gifts she got for me was a PS5 so I could play Remnant II when it came out because she knew I really wanted it. It was a hugely sweet gesture and it meant so much to me that she would do that even though we were struggling. 
More recently I've found out that my ex is £6,000 in debt. She took out a loan to support us when I first came over from America and never told me about it so that I wouldn't feel guilty. Well I DID feel guilty when I found out, and I believed that the stress of this debt and making payments on it was a huge part of why she fell out of love with me: she was having to deal with it all alone because I didn't know about it.
So, because I want to do right by her and be a good man, I've been saving. Since I found out about the debt I've managed to pay off 5k out of the 6k she owes. It's been hard, I've had to cut corners, skip meals, and I haven't spent a penny on anything for myself. To help make sure the interest rate in her debt didn't go up, she asked me for £300 in April. I gave it to her, of course, but I didn't want to take that money out of my savings because I wanted to reach £6k as fast as possible. So I sold my PS5 on eBay and gave her the money from that. I didn't tell her I'd sold it because I thought she would be upset that I sold her gift. 
Cut to today, she texted me asking if I'd seen that the new Space Marine 2 game had come out. I said I had and as the conversation went on I accidentally let it slip that I didn't have the PS5 anymore. Once the truth was out I admitted that I'd sold it and told her exactly why I'd sold it. Now she's furious with me, saying that it meant a lot to her to be able to get it for me and that it feels like I've discounted her gift and the effort she put in to buy it for me. I could get that if I had kept the money for myself, but I gave it to her to help pay a debt that she'd kept secret from me for 3.5 years, ON TOP of the other 5k I've given her at great personal sacrifice AFTER SHE DUMPED ME. I feel like she's being unreasonable, but maybe I was wrong to sell her gift. The worry is keeping me awake, so I hope some of you can help me figure out if I'm in the wrong here.

17,1fg3xav,AITA for telling my sister that our brother shouldn't have a cat?,"I (18) have been bumping heads with my brother (16) for almost 2 months. Towards the beginning of the school year he has been wanting a kitten. But I told him that it wasn't a good idea and at most wait until he graduates or moves out so he can properly care for one. He got one anyways.  At the time he got her he had at least $500 to get anything the kitten needed but instead spent it all on food, games and going out with friends. He also keeps his room so cold to the point that you get goosebumps from a few minutes of standing in there. I told him that that wasn't good for a 3 week kitten and asked him to at least turn down the air. Instead he bordered up the staircase ( we live in the attic) and left her in the hall so he didn't have to.

Of course I wasn't going to let her be in the hallway so she's been living in my room. I went and set up everything she needed and watch her throughout the day because I do my classes from home. When classes started for him he'd come home and she would run out to greet him and he will step over her and get on his game. I noticed this and said that if he isn't going to spend time with his kitten then he can at least do her food, water, litter, and take her on the weekends. He in fact did not instead he took the litter box I made for her and she ended up ruining my rug, graduation gown, clothing, cover, etc. I had enough and went and stood in his room for 3 hours until I finally got him to buy her some litter. When it did come he just lest everything in the hall and I had to set it up.

Also both of our cats ended up getting fleas ( yes we had a cat before he got one) i told him about it. And he shrugged me off. I had to do the flea treatment on both of them by myself and my arms and hands got scratched up but at least I haven't seen more on them. He also has been saying almost daily that he hates me because the cat likes me more. But he tosses her in my room any time she goes near him.

I said I owe her $20 because math. 140/7 people = 20. And she replied that since her and our other sister are married, the couples pay jointly. So her math is 140/4 = 35. 

I told her that since everyone’s names were put on the bowling screen separately, we should be charged separately. She argued that it was split per household. I told her that made “no fucking sense.” I sent her $20 and we’re not speaking atm. 

My mom gets my side of things but some of my coworkers also understand the “per household” charge and say it’s more traditional.

But I never liked to talk about it with others. It normally opens up a lot of questions about my biological (or real as some would call them) parents. Or some people start talking about my parents like they're not really my parents. I had it happen when I was a lot younger and started school and told people my ""special story"".

I told my fiancée when we started dating but apart from her and some very close friends I never talk about it with people. To me it's not something that anyone else needs to know. This includes my fiancée's family.

My adopted status was revealed to my fiancée's family during a recent visit of theirs. I got a knock on the door from a PI who informed me my biological parents were interested in contact with me and they overheard. They had a lot of questions but primarily they were angry at me, for two reasons. Firstly, and most importantly for this post, because I didn't tell them. They did not like ""being kept in the dark"" and did not like my fiancée's response that it wasn't any of their business. Secondly, because I expressed to the PI I was not interested in any contact with them and asked him to pass this onto my biological parents. My fiancée's family had the very reaction I try to avoid from people and they asked how I could turn down the chance to know my ""real family"".

But the primary criticism is that I did not tell them and let them find out that way. They said they could have had grandkids affected by this and I wouldn't tell them. My fiancée reminded them it was none of their business and she had them leave early when they refused to let the topic go. But her parents are still pissed at me.

They had a lot of questions but primarily they were angry at me, for two reasons. Firstly, and most importantly for this post, because I didn't tell them. They did not like ""being kept in the dark"" and did not like my fiancée's response that it wasn't any of their business. Secondly, because I expressed to the PI I was not interested in any contact with them and asked him to pass this onto my biological parents. My fiancée's family had the very reaction I try to avoid from people and they asked how I could turn down the chance to know my ""real family"".

But the primary criticism is that I did not tell them and let them find out that way. They said they could have had grandkids affected by this and I wouldn't tell them. My fiancée reminded them it was none of their business and she had them leave early when they refused to let the topic go. But her parents are still pissed at me.

My village is small, 3k residents, and we have an ordinance that if you want to solicit you register with the town hall so they confirm it’s only legit companies allowed.

24,1fg1sp0,AITAH for defending a girl against my friends who were holding a grudge?,"this is a summarized version.

———

I've been friends with two sisters (18 & 16) for as long as I can remember, but we had a falling out a couple of months ago and I need some outside perspective.

We had a Discord server where another girl, Sarah, joined. She and the sisters had a past issue involving an older guy who manipulated her when she was younger, but she’s since healed from it. The sisters started being really mean to her over small things, like symbols for text channels. They accused me of siding with Sarah, even though I made it clear I wasn't. When they wouldn't listen to me, I muted them on call because they kept cutting me off.

After that, things escalated, and they accused me of inviting Sarah, which wasn’t true. They wouldn't believe me, no matter how much I tried to explain. They also said things like, ""It's not our fault what happened to her; we don’t have to treat her differently just because she was groomed."" This really upset me, so I defended Sarah. They kept blaming me for everything, and it got to the point where I left the server and the group chat.

I feel guilty for not kicking Sarah out earlier to avoid all this, but at the time, I didn’t think that was right. After leaving, I found out they called me dramatic and deleted all the chat logs, which had proof of how mean they were being. I’m wondering if I overreacted or if I was in the wrong. Part of me wants to reach out, but I feel like if they wanted to make things right, they would’ve.

Was I too dramatic, or were they being unfair?

If I were to back in time, I would have still defended Sarah.

Edit :: I just wanted to say that I won't be friends with them again but did I overreact by leaving, and causing a seen in the server? The only reason a part of me wants to talk to them is because I have known them all my life, I am supporting Sarah in this situation still.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITAH for defending a girl against my friends who were holding a grudge? this is a summarized version.

I am a full time PhD student so do not make a ton, but have been able to make things work. I have also been solely in charge of our finances for the past three years.

The other half of the paycheck is ours to do with what we please.

On top of this my partner asserted that it is my over budgeting and overspending that is stopping her from reaching her financial goals, ignoring the fact she has an entire half paycheck to put towards those goals. 

Jump to today. She just got paid and I suggest she put $100 in her empty savings account to start building towards her financial goals.

27,1fg115v,AITA for forgetting to tell my dad that I had planned to visit home from abroad and only made plans to see my mum?,"Throwaway account.

My dad was a pretty solid father growing up. He told me he loved me, hugged me often, and always said he was proud of me.

But, to be fair, he never really went the extra mile. For example, he’d complain when he had to pick me up from summer camp after not seeing me for weeks. He hated coming to my yearly dance show and barely knew anything about my school life, my degree, or even what I do for work now. He gave me the basics, but that’s it. By 21, I was completely independent, paid for my own master’s, and have been working ever since. He stopped offering any kind of financial or emotional support after that, and I don’t think he ever realized I might have needed more from him.

My parents aren’t together, and I’ve been making an effort to visit home a lot recently because my mum's been going through some tough times. We’re really close—she’s been my rock, and now I’m trying to be hers. But my dad? Over the past year, whenever I visit, he’s often too busy with his wife to spend time with me. If I get an hour over an entire weekend, that’s a lot. And every time he says, “We’ll make up for it next time,” but then he’s unavailable again. It’s left me feeling distant from him, like he’s a stranger now. Even when I’ve invited him on holiday, he always brings his wife and ends up spending all his time with her. I don’t have any issues with her, but I was really hoping for some 1:1 time with my dad, which just hasn’t happened.

Now for the big part... I planned my usual monthly trip home recently and completely forgot to let him know. By the time I did, it was the day I was supposed to leave, and he’d already made plans with his wife. He said it wasn’t a big deal, but I feel terrible. I didn’t forget on purpose, I just had a lot on my mind planning with my mum, and it slipped. Now I’m sitting here feeling like an asshole for forgetting, even though it wasn’t intentional. So, Reddit, am I the asshole?

Now understand, he can be difficult to work with sometimes, and expects long hours from his employees. Part of his reason for this is to be the best at something, it has to be more than a 9 to 5. 

I am the newest addition to the firm. We have one other attorney and 2 paralegals who have been around for a while.

However, since I came back from taking the bar exam a month and a half ago, I haven’t had a single day off. This includes weekends. Many days I don’t go home until 6 or 7pm. Once again, this is expected and fine with me. Recently though, I’ve been experiencing some serious burnout. I’ve started getting more frustrated at work and bumping heads with the boss a bit more. I had expressed to the boss that I’m exhausted and need a couple of days to recoup. That was met with a request later that day to come in that weekend to help prepare for trial the next week.

I expressed my frustrations with my parents, to which my mom said “Don’t ask him, tell him you’re taking two days off”.

Once trial was over, I did that. The boss was clearly confused by this but didn’t treat it like it was a big deal. So I took the days off, Wednesday and Thursday.

All during this time, the other members of the first would be taking days off. On one occasion, a paralegal straight up walked out of the firm out of frustration with a case and scheduled in 3 days off.

He said it was disrespectful to him and everyone else in the firm. He said I’m young and should be working as much as possible and learning as much as possible. He said he should’ve fired me on the spot when I did it. And that it wasn’t fair to everyone else that I took those days off. I was astounded by this and extremely upset.

A few days ago, she mentioned that she will be going on a road trip with her sister next week. Nothing was said about transportation until today when I asked her if she would be driving my car. She said yes. The road trip would be a long journey and I’m not really comfortable with her driving my car for such a stretch without me present. 

So I told her how I felt and pointed out to her that while I’d prefer if they had an alternate choice of transport (which they do; her sister has a relatively new car capable of long distances), I would also appreciate it if she had asked for my permission instead of me finding out about it. 

Now, she feels that I’m a selfish bastard who doesn’t even let his gf drive his car.

34,1fg09z9,AITA for trying to prevent a road rage situation with my husband?,"My husband has a history of road rage and anger problems. He's much better with the road rage now but I still get nervous everytime a bad driver does something that could trigger him.

We live in a major city in the UK. Today my husband was changing lanes but a car came zooming up behind and didn't let him go. It could have been a horrible collision but we avoided it. We were shocked but it's no surprise to see careless drivers where we live. 

We continue to our destination, a shopping centre car park, with that car still in front of us. I then realise that my husband is following that same car, so I ask him ""are you following that car?"". He ignores me so I ask again. He says ""yes I just want to ask him something"". I urged him to leave it, I told him it's not worth it and you never know it could escalate, especially as knife and gun crime is on the rise in the city. I told him a couple more times to leave it, worried that it could turn into a horrible situation given his anger problems.

He then speedily drives off and was angry with me for stopping him. He parked, told me I ""talk too fucking much"" and stormed off out of the car without me. I was flabbergasted. He was off with me the entire time while shopping, and wouldn't respond when I told him I didn't deserve that for simply wanting to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. 

When we got back to the car, we had a heated argument after I told him I didn't deserve to be treated like that. I told him he was taking his anger issues out on me, and asked him what I did to deserve that. He said I don't know how to ""handle"" him and that I should have let him speak to the driver. In a really condescending tone he told me I was really annoying for going on when I asked him to leave it. He said other hurtful things, claiming I was acting like his ""mother"" and blaming me for how angry he was - which apparently could have been avoided if he got to speak to the driver.

AITA for stopping him from approaching the driver? 

TL;DR: Bad driver did something dangerous, triggered husband with a past history of road rage. I asked him to not approach the driver, he eventually decided to not to, but got extremely angry with me and blamed me for being ""annoying"", not letting him speak to the driver and for winding him up.



Update: thanks for all of your responses. My husband is still blaming me for his anger yesterday and says it wouldn't have been as bad if I didn't say anything. He admits he was angry and wound up from the bad driver, so I told him it's all the better I tried to stop him from approaching him. He said me interfering and trying to stop him made the situation ""worse"", that he doesn't have anger problems and I should leave if I'm hoping he'll work on his anger. We've had problems for years and this is feeling like the final straw. I refuse to be vilified for tying to defuse a situation, no matter how ""annoying"" my nagging seemed to him in the moment.

35,1fg0124,AITAH for excluding my autistic cousin I have never met from my wedding? ,"I (24F) am getting married to my fiancé(25M) next fall. However I do not want to invite my aunt’s family because they might embarrass me. 

My aunt (42F) was a house wife for a number of years before her serial cheater husband got fired from 4 low-income jobs in 9 years. My aunt recently picked up some work to help pay the bills. Her financial and home situation is definitely tough at the moment. My Aunt also believes in a lot of stupid conspiracy theories such as anti vax and that dinosaurs and evolution are fake. She also claims she’s Muslim but then doesn’t follow any of the basic principles. 

Here’s where some people think I’m a huge asshole. My Aunt’s son who is 11 turning 12 has autism. I have never met my cousin except through videos that my Aunt emails us. My cousin has limited verbal skills. Also from what I can tell from the videos he lacks emotional regulation and is quite loud. To be clear the wedding is not child free. All my fiancés cousins are 12 or over and I have 2 other cousins as well. The other two are 6 year old twins and are the sweetest most well behaved girls you’ll ever meet. We’ve actually spent some time together since they live only 6 hours away. I want to invite them and my other aunt to my wedding if they are willing to come.

This is relevant because when my grandma kept badgering me I conceded to inviting my aunt only. My mom and grandma are now mad at me saying I’m punishing my cousin for a condition he was born with. They told me I’m assuming that he will be disruptive just because he has autism even though I’ve never met him. It’s certainly true I’ve never met him. The wedding will have a lot of loud music and long, boring speeches so I’m not sure if that will be ok for him. I also haven’t seen, called, or even texted my aunt in 10 entire years. She makes no effort to personally communicate with me anyways. Frankly I didn’t even want to invite her in the first place. But I guess I’m somehow obligated to invite her and her entire family because we are blood related? 

Currently, my Dad is paying for the entire wedding because it’s been a dream of his to fully pay for his only daughter’s wedding. My mom is saying I’m extremely ungrateful and that I don’t deserve the money if I cruelly exclude family. Am I really the most villainous person here though? My grandma and my mom are millionaire housewives while my aunt is literally on welfare. If they truly cared about her well-being they would help her out financially. Seems very hypocritical to me.

37,1ffzpf2,WIBTA for not going to a club commitment?,"Me (21F) and my friend (20F) are both members of a college club, and are members of the executive board. There is a club event every fall that is about an 8 hour drive away, and we are expected to attend, since we have previously attended events such as these before. My friend’s car has been volunteered as the main form of transportation to the event, and I am the only other person able to drive the car. So, we would both be responsible for driving club members there and back. 

Both me and my friend are conflicted about attending this event, due to costs and commitment times. It would probably be about $200/person to attend, even with partial coverage by the school. On top of this, we both have academic and work responsibilities that we would have to sacrifice in order to attend this event. However, if we choose not to attend, other club members who are relying on us for transportation may not be able to return to campus in a timely manner. We do not want to ruin our relationship with our club advisor/other club members, but realistically we can not afford to attend the event, without some extreme budgeting. 

Additionally, the time invested in going to this event would take away from other priorities we have including: other clubs, our jobs, our academics, as well as preparing for graduation and applying to post-grad jobs. We overall just don’t think that driving 16-hours round trip for a day and a half long event is worth the expense and time. My friend is also not fully on board with using her car, as the trip would put over 1000 miles on her personal vehicle. She has driven to all the previous club events, and so it was just assumed that she would be able to drive to this one as well, but this was decided without her consultation/agreement. I would otherwise offer my own car, but at the moment, it is unavailable and getting work done due to being involved in an accident recently.

Overall, we are conflicted about our decision regarding this event. We feel that it would be best financially and academically to reserve our time and resources to other commitments.

The doctor assured us that he would see her twice a week and suggested a fantastic facility. 



Here is where the issue lies. My uncle (mid-50s) has told us the facility is too far (it’s 15 minutes away) and that “no one will visit my aunt” due to the distance. Everyone in my family (except for 1) knows how to drive, so I don’t know where this excuse is coming from. The doctor told us about a facility that was near our home but was honest and said that he only visits that location once a month. I looked at the reviews, and they are horrible. I know all facilities aren’t perfect, but if we have the opportunity to send my aunt to a place where she can get better care, why not send her there? 



We told other family members about this, and have gotten the silent treatment. My mom and I had a very heated argument yesterday because she doesn’t like confrontation and wants to go with the choice my uncle has made. Even though he’s the youngest, they want to go with his decision based on the fact that he’s a man. I told her that it’s unfair and that since she’s the decision-maker on all my aunt’s paperwork, she should have the final say. 



Now here’s the part where I might be the asshole. I called the nurse earlier today and told her that my mom would be going with the facility the doctor recommended.

AITA for making my daughter share a room with her cousin 

I have a daughter 15f

We are planning to go to a family event with a city for 5 days and have planned a lot of activities. My sister and her kids are also going .

The plan is for me and my sister and her younger daughter to stay in a room together while my daughter and her older daughter who is 19 to stay in a room nearby.

My daughter is angry as she doesn't want to share a room especially with an adult she is upset that she won't have privacy.

Unfortunately our hotel doesn't have available connecting rooms and she can't stay in a non connecting room alone because of hotel polices so the only option would be to get a 2 bedroom suite which would cost thousands extra of dollars and would be a waste of money in my opinion. So i told my daughter no.

She started to cry and asked to stay home I told her she could but shed have to stay with her grandparents who are old fashioned and think video games and electronics ruin kids lifes they have a policy that she isn't allowed to play video games or use her phone unless she needs to call anyone. Which obviously she hates.

My daughter wants to bring her laptops to play video games at the hotel but she plays loud games and screams a lot while doing so which my niece doesn't like especially as she plays at night a lot my niece always tries to get my daughter to do something else whenever she comes over. And my daughter thinks her cousin won't let her okay video games if she shares a room with her.

Now my daughter wants to stay alone or get a suite I'm not doing either of them. But I'm wondering if this is the hill to die on.

41,1ffyykj,AITA for wanting my mom to use the other two bathrooms in the house?,"I (19f) have a mom (50f) who has a house with three full bathrooms. One bathroom in the primary bedroom. One bathroom on the ground floor and one bathroom in the basement. 

The basement is basically my step dads man-cave, and i feel uncomfortable going down there intruding his space.

And the bathroom in the primary bedroom is also in my step dads and mom's room. 
They have two bedrooms, one on the ground floor during the summer months. And one on the top floor, where they both sleep in the winter. my step dad uses both rooms but my mom only stays in the top floor in the colder months. 

The only bathroom i feel comfortable in is the ground floor since i don't want to run into my step dad, in case he's sleeping or getting dressed or whatever. 

but my mom has taken the ground floor as her main bathroom. she uses it to do her hair, and hair and products gets literally everywhere and clogs the clog stopper. and since it clogs, the sink/shower gets dirtier faster.. she's always the one to clean the house though, and she cleans the bathroom 1-2x a week. she started to pour chemicals in the sink and shower to kind of passively aggressively get us to clean it. but me and my brother don't take showers as often as she does, she does it twice a day, while me and my brother tend to a few times a week.. i know it's disgusting but im okay with that..

but she's started saying i could also start cleaning the bathroom. and i think that's annoying. since i specifically wanted to have hair where its low maintenance and i feel like im cleaning other peoples messes more often. when she's the one causing the messes with her hair products. and her hair dryer keeps setting off the fire alarm but she has a system to avoid it most the time.

she spends so much of her time in the bathroom, with her makeup, her hair that can take HOURSS (black people get it) and taking showers and brushing teeth.

i feel she spends most of the time in there when i go for the most basic stuff. and when i do my hair, i do it in my room. 

really i just feel upset that i can't take a poop. when she's in there, being busy. she tells me to go to another bathroom. but it makes me uncomfortable, i feel likes it walking into someone else's room and doing as you please. which it kind of literally is.

i'm sure it'll all go away as winter comes since she'll move back upstairs. but i'm just so annoyed..

i know it's her house and she can do whatever. i'm planning on leaving in the spring. and i pay rent. so i feel i deserve to feel heard too. idk.. i feel like all the little things i want is always too much. i'm not sure if im not appreciating the big things they do, but i can't remember what they do for me. she cook and clean the house pretty regularly. and i help with the dishes sometimes the time since i can't cook in a dirty kitchen. maybe a few times a week.

44,1ffyruv,AITAH for yelling at my dad because he refuses to discipline my sister?,"Context; I live with my father and stepmother, but recently my sister moved back in from her mother's house. For years my sister (13) has been spoiled, allowed to do no chores and play games on her pc and phone from the moment she gets home to the moment she goes to bed. Anytime she does something wrong she avoids taking responsibility by lying moving back to her bio mother's house. 

This time she had to move back to our house because my other sister (15) and her got into a physical fight because she kept breaking stuff (an expensive speaker, a TV, $100 heels, ect.). She even took photos of my other sister and carved curse runes over her. Yeah, not fun.

She would manipulate my parents and her mother (consciously). She admitted this in Walmart when she was 12. The conversation that as follows:

KId: (puppy dog eyes and pointing to a hello kitty purse) please? I love you

Stepmother: (this kid just back-talked her earlier) I'm not like your daddy, I'm not buying that for you after you acted up.

Kid: I know, I just know how to manipulate people to get what I want (proceeds to ask my dad--in a separate isle--for the purse instead).

Moving forward, this kid talks down to me, everything I say results in a ""shut up"", ""I don't care"", or ""You're stupid"" from her. She also does things that I personally would have had the ever-loving shit beat out of me for, such as:

 Cutting up clothes, WEARING A THONG TO MIDDLE SCHOOL, Purposefully pulling down the neck of shirts and dresses to ""make [stepmother's name] mad"" (her words exactly), Making messes and not cleaning them up, Constant sexualization of herself and others, Refusing to eat dinner and opting to eat cup noodles and chocolate, Lying, Stealing from and bullying children (admitted to it), Swearing in front of (or to) our parents, and kicking one of the family dogs (she poured nair on the other. My father is well aware and the most he has ever done is say, ""don't do that"".

The most recent instance was my breaking point. My expensive white rug (that was bought to cover up the stains from slime, paint, mascara, and fingernail polish that she put in the floor) ended up stained with her makeup. I informed my father of my devastating discovery and she tries to blame me (i do not own makeup). All he has to say is ""will it come out?"" Inattentively and staring at his video games.

I finally confronted my dad about his complacent and dismissive attitude in the midst of my (valid) frustration and he defended everything she had done that I brought up (the thong, talking bad to me and my step mother, and having a rotten attitude) and the most that was done was, yet again, him telling her to not do that and to write down 15 things she did wrong (truly a revolutionary punishment considering she lied to him multiple times to get out of the punishment and afterwards continued to play on her computer).

Starting around 6-7 months, we started experimenting with different foods for him to try since his teeth were starting to come in. Well, a week and a half ago, my mother in law was staying the night with us, because she needed to be at work in the morning and we live closer to her work than she does. Plus she probably wanted some baby time. She sat down with us when we ate dinner and as soon as we started eating, she asked why we were just feeding our son puffs instead of the food we were eating. 

Well, 
A) we are having a late dinner around 7:15 when we usually eat at 6pm and give him his last bottle at around 8. So we were just giving him a snack since we were going to be giving him his bottle literally right after we ate dinner. Didn’t see a point in feeding him real food too. And 
B) we were eating super greasy Mexican food. Didn’t really want to give him some greasy ass food. 

We both basically said this to her and she was just convinced we were in the wrong. Then she started saying that she was worried about our son, thinking he doesn’t eat enough real food and gets too much milk. Granted, he is 10 months old… milk is supposed to be his primary source of nutrients. Our son is a little on the smaller side, but he’s very active for his age and his height and weight have only gone up since birth, so his pediatrician says baby boy is perfect. But the MIL, is going off of some doctor that’s never, not once, met or seen my son in person. At this point, me and my husband are offended. I ended up just shutting up at the table. I lost my appetite. She kept saying the same things and completely brushing off what we were telling her that are facts. She was going off one website and that doctor as a resource. It got to the point that she was having my husband read off nutrition facts off his formula and snacks.. like what?! I was upset so I got my son and walked away. They went on about this for 30 minutes… never have I felt more disrespected in my own house. Both my husband and I took it as her attacking our role as parents. Basically saying that he’s malnourished, is how we took it. She actually had me questioning my ability as a mother at one point. I can’t believe I even have to say this, but we feed our son. Maybe even too much sometimes. He clears bottles and pouches like a champ. When we do offer him real food, he eats it as well as he can.. and he gets better at it every day.

48,1ffxs0w,AITA for telling my BFF cheating isn’t a big deal and she’s a bitch for unfriending me over something so stupid?,"I (15F) have been BFFs with a girl who I’ll call “Raine” for a third of my entire life. A couple of days before school started, we were hanging out at a mutual friend’s house with the 8 other girls in our friend group. Our mutual friend’s mother said we shouldn’t spend so much time on our phones and suggested we play a board game. We’re kind of weirder than most people our age so we decided to try a game of scrabble. At one point in the game, my letters included XYQU, and I literally could not think of a single word. I asked to use the bathroom, and I secretly used my phone to google the answer. When I came back, I put down the word “exequy”. Everyone immediately accused me of cheating because I’d used such an unknown word. I admitted to it, since it was kind of obvious I cheated. Raine was annoyed at me, saying it wasn’t fair to everyone else, but she said it in a joking kind of way, so I didn’t realise she was serious.

The next time I talked to Raine was the first day of school. I sat next to her like I always do, and she rolled her eyes and moved. Then at break time, the entire friend group ignored anything I said. I asked Raine if she was still mad at me over what happened, and she said she didn’t want to talk to me.

At lunch time, I tried to talk to her, and she started yelling at me. She said I was a fake friend, and she couldn’t believe I was still talking to them as if nothing had happened. I told her she was overreacting and she said I was selfish for trying to control her feelings after everything I’d done. This is kinda embarrassing to admit but I’m really sensitive and I tried so hard not to cry. I reminded her that we’d been friends for half a decade and we’d never had an argument before, so it doesn’t make sense for her to suddenly switch up on me over something so small. I said that cheating in a scrabble game of all things is literally the stupidest reason to unfriend someone. She said I only ever thought about myself, and I snapped and called her a bitch.

I know I shouldn’t of cheated but I think she’s making a big deal out of nothing.

50,1ffxpai,AITA for making a sexual joke towards my girlfriends friend during a conversation where they were making similar jokes to each other?,"I was recently hanging out with my girlfriend and her friend. My girlfriend and her friend are close friends and they always makes jokes and weird comments with each other and overshare, but I guess they're used to that with each other cause they've been friends for so long. Like jokes about pissing or about sexual topics would not be out of line for them.

For example, I asked the friend why her boyfriend didn't come along, and she laughed and said ""I guess he must bored with me"" and ""he's probably off with some other girls"" which is an example of the sardonic humour she'd use. 

Later we were talking about social media and stuff, and I was asking her friend what social media she has and if she browses reddit, and my girlfriend then asked her as a joke if she has only fans (which wasn't even funny imo).  But I'm writing this to give you an idea of the sorts of jokes that they say between each other and how they push boundaries, and like there's no real line, so I figured it was okay to say jokes that might be offensive if it were to other people.

Later they were talking about their body and their chest, and my girlfriend (who has a very small chest) was going on about how I allegedly prefer girls with big bosoms (I don't but my gf seems convinced that I do, because a few times big bosomed women have appeared on my instagram feed) was joking and saying ""maybe he prefers you cause you're more his type, you should take him"" and the friend said ""I'm okay with that, my boyfriend probably wouldn't even notice"" and we all laughed, cause we are used to making those edgy jokes with each other.

Later on we were driving home, and they were complaining that I was driving too fast, then I said something to my girlfriend that was along the lines of ""if we crash, she's safe, you're not, she has double airbags to protect her and you don't"". It was a joke and it was similar to the sorts of edgy out-there jokes they had been making but apparently this one was offensive.

My gf was all like ""that's really not funny"", and her friend was like ""you shouldn't say stuff like that around your gf"".

52,1ffx88z,AITA when I said that my cousin should leave?,"I (15m) have had an interesting relationship with my cousin (16m) who we will call Mark. I have been somewhat friendly to Mark, but recently my attitude towards him has been very different.

For starters when we were young he would cry, a lot. To the point where it felt like I was walking on eggshells every time I talk to him. He also never gave me personal space, and would constanly be basically attached to me while we were walking to school or if I'm reading etc etc.

However, I was still chill with him and was friendly to him because A. Hes my cousin and B. He doesn't have a lot of friends at school so I figured that I should be by him and have his back, like an older brother.

Anyway during spring break, my cousin came over for a week to visit (He's been over multiple times.) And I was excited since I haven't seen him in person since lockdown. He hasn't changed much since I met him, he's obviously a bit taller but still the Mark I knew. However, quickly I realized that his attitude is wildly different from when I last met him. he would constantly take my stuff without asking, downloaded and deleted games without asking on my ps5, and other stuff.

But the worst was when we were at the park, I was introducing him to my friends while we were playing football. He was off to the side for most of the time even when I asked if he wanted to play. So, I figured he must be tired and went to do my own thing. When Mark and I got dropped off by my friends mom, we went inside the house and Mark immideatly went to my room to play on my ps5 (he was grinding call of duty warzone on my account.) And my mom, pulled me aside before I went to my room. She said she needed to have a talk with me. I asked her what I did when she started getting mad at me because she got a text from mark that I didn't let him play football with me and my friends. I tried to explain to her that he didn't want to play and refused when I asked, but she didn't have any of it, saying that I've been rude to Mark this entire trip and I need to be more friendly to him because he doesn't have a lot of friends. I calmly said ok to my mom and ran to my room to confront Mark. When I asked him why he did that he gave me a weird look and lied and said what are you talking about. I had enough and ripped the controller away from him and started yelling at him that he has been rude and inconsiderate this entire trip and I said I'm not surprised you have no friends because you don't respect anyone. He got mad and ran down to the living room to tell my Mom what I said. She started yelling at me and said that what I said was disrespectful and I shouldn't be so rude to our guest.

Mom and I don't have a great relationship and I don't have a bad relationship with my stepsister but I don't have really much to do with her. I see her as my mom's husbands kid and not really a sibling. 

My dad pre-ordered two upcoming horror games for me Until Dawn's PS5 remaster/remake and Silent Hill 2's remake. Mom saw the pre-order email on my phone and asked me when they were out and I told her October. My stepsister games too and she was excited when I mentioned them. She asked her dad if she could get them too. My mom said we should just share my copies and I said no. Mom told me it made sense rather than buying two copies for one household. I said the games are going to dad's house, where I live, not to hers. Mom told me I could choose to spend more time with her and I could choose to bring games over and let my stepsister enjoy them too.

I didn't back down and mom called me on it after dinner. This was the last time I went over there. She said I have a sibling and could learn how to share and to think about the games getting played more and not wasting money on the same thing. I told her she wasn't paying for it twice by buying them for her stepdaughter.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA for not sharing my new video games with my stepsister? I (16m) have a stepsister (15f) at my mom's house. I live most of the time with my dad. Mom and I don't have a great relationship and I don't have a bad relationship with my stepsister but I don't have really much to do with her. I see her as my mom's husbands kid and not really a sibling. 

My dad pre-ordered two upcoming horror games for me Until Dawn's PS5 remaster/remake and Silent Hill 2's remake. Mom saw the pre-order email on my phone and asked me when they were out and I told her October. My stepsister games too and she was excited when I mentioned them. She asked her dad if she could get them too. My mom said we should just share my copies and I said no. Mom told me it made sense rather than buying two copies for one household. I said the games are going to dad's house, where I live, not to hers. Mom told me I could choose to spend more time with her and I could choose to bring games over and let my stepsister enjoy them too.

I didn't back down and mom called me on it after dinner. This was the last time I went over there. She said I have a sibling and could learn how to share and to think about the games getting played more and not wasting money on the same thing. I told her she wasn't paying for it twice by buying them for her stepdaughter.

Since moving in, my roommates schedule has been changing constantly. They're currently unemployed so sometimes they are up at random times and sometimes at 2, 3, 5 AM just cooking outside and it's been disrupting my sleep. I work at 7 and go to sleep around 12-12:30 Am. They have also cooked around 7 or 8 AM which I don't care but I just need my sleep from 1-7AM. I've told my friend multiple times that I'm only requesting this on WEEEK DAYS and I have no problem with noises on the weekend but it goes no where. I feel like I've been duped..

Before moving in, my friend and I talked about establishing regular check ins and rules. However, we haven't done any of those due to her mental health and her boyfriend is out of the picture because he feels too awkward to be in the same room as me. I haven't done anything.. I was there for her whenever they fought (seen how he treats her, their messages) and he said that was the equivalent of ""me seeing him naked"", which he apparently he didn't realize he would feel that way until the MOVE IN DAY and meeting me for the first time... Since then, he's refused to be in the same vicinity as me which I don't care but I have no way of having ""roommate communication"" with him.

I text my friend whenever I wake up from the noise but sometimes it is simply not her fault. I feel like the asshole for putting her in the middle but I'm at a loss about what to do. I can feel this is creating a drift between us and she has been getting more vague so I'm wondering if asking them for quiet hours is the asshole move.

58,1ffumci,AITA for telling my mom not to bring groceries to my house when she comes over for dinner?,"I have an amazing mom. With a slight problem - She loves me way too much. So much in fact that it has become a sort of joke in my friend group. She just takes everything to the next level. It is really sweet, but sometimes a little too much.

Every single time she has come to my house for dinner, she would ask what to bring, and I would be like: ""How is the Mango tree doing, can you get us some, it could be a great dessert"". Well, she would come to our house with like 15lbs of Mangos, a mountain of barries my wife likes and other items we didn't ask for but she knows we love. It is a sweet gesture, but literally 100% of the time we have too much things from her and it both blocks the whole fridge and eventually is thrown away because we cannot eat the things fast enough. Just for reference, she came to out house like 3 months ago when my dad was on a work trip abroad and brought like 12 beers that my wife sort of likes, even though she knows we don't really drink, we still have like 11 of those 12 at home.. It's just her love language (and the love language of her parent's as well..).

So my parents are coming today for dinner again, which is awesome. When talking to her this morning she asked what to bring and I told her: ""Nothing, we got it all covered."" She then went through like 5-6 items that she knows we like and asked to bring them and again I told here there is absolutely no need. Finally I just told her the reason (I was really calm and loving about it, just told her that I know she cannot stop herself from brining a non-normal amount of food, so it is better to not bring anything, and that I know she loves me even if she doesn't bring anything with her). She got kinda sad on the phone and told me that she doesn't feel right not bringing anything.

I really don't want to make her sad, but she spends so much money on items we don't even eat or drink that I would rather her just come and be with us without all the hassel.

60,1ffu1c7,AITA for telling my sister that me not giving my child a vintage name doesn't mean she can't?,"My sister (33f) and I (29f) are both expecting our first baby. My sister is super in love with vintage names and for about a decade has talked everyone's ear off about how much she wants to have babies with these names. I know her top three names for boys and girls are Edith, Martha, Audrey (for girls) and Alan, Harold, Stanley (for boys). I'm not sure which of these names my future niece or nephew will get but I know they are still my sisters top choices.

My husband and I are not going for vintage names or classic names. We chose Lyric which is pretty modern and not super common. My sister doesn't know the name yet but she is aware of some names we chose not to use (we chose not to use names that could be difficult to spell or say based on the spelling) and she was upset we didn't have any vintage names on there.

She made all these suggestions and I told her thanks but we had a different type of name we wanted. She asked why we didn't want to have the cousins match styles and she said how cute it would be to have two little cousins with matching old people names. She had this idea of doing this photoshoot when the babies are born where we dress them like grannies/grandpas and she said the old names would make everything so much more perfect. 

I stopped talking about it when she did not take no for an answer. I got lists of vintage names, sent articles on how vintage names are in style right now. I ignored it all. She even sent me Instagram and TikTok accounts where influences have babies with these vintage names and she's like ooh, look how cute. Doesn't this name sounds so sweet for this little baby. Doesn't the vintage name add to the cuteness.

I didn't engage or buy into any of it.

Now my sister is crying and saying I'm ruining this and she commented like she can't use a vintage name for her baby because we're not. I told her just because I'm not giving my daughter a vintage name it doesn't mean she can't use a vintage name for *her* baby. I pointed out they are two separate people, with different parents and don't need to match. She cried it won't be the same and why can't I see how dismissive my comment is.

61,1ffu0ar,AITA for shopping at the “poor people” thrift store?,"I (24f) have always been really into thrift shopping. I love experimenting with fashion and I would not be able to do that without thrift store prices. I shop at retail stores occasionally but they are way too expensive for me. I usually go thrift shopping once a week just to browse, as I find it sort of therapeutic to look through all the racks to see what I can find. Usually if I’m thrifting, I’m going to a big chain thrift store like Goodwill. I would also like to point out that I have never bought anything at the thrift store with the intention of reselling it for a huge profit. 

Recently, I discovered my town has a small thrift store through our local charity where everything is $1 (clothes, shoes, small household items). When I first heard about it, I assumed it was just for families with low income. Their website says open to all and I was curious, so I decided I was going to get a bag of donations together to drop off to feel out the place. When I got there, there were signs everywhere that said the money they make from the thrift store goes directly back into the charity to help people in our community who need food, shelter, etc. After chatting with an employee, I learned that they encourage everyone to come check out the store because there’s a stigma around the charity thrift store that only really poor people can shop there, so sometimes they don’t meet their monthly sales goals. 

Last week, I was out with two of my girlfriends  when one of them complimented my shirt so I told them I got it at the $1 thrift store and explained how the charity works. They both scoffed and looked at me with disgust. They told me it was wrong of me to shop there and I’m taking away from people who really need it, no matter what any employee says. They also said that it’s embarrassing for me to go there because then people would assume I’m poor. I told them it’s not like a tiny store with one rack. This store is FULL with more clothes than our community could ever need. It really didn’t matter what I said, both of them had a reason it was “so wrong”. One friend said it didn’t matter how poor she was, she wouldn’t be caught dead shopping there. Here’s where I might be the AH. Knowing her financial situation from previous conversations, i said “well at least i don’t have a crippling retail shopping addiction with $8k in credit card debt to match”. I then got up and left without saying another word. The next day they were both texting me and doubling down on their arguments saying I  shouldn’t take everything so seriously. I told them they not only insulted me, but they also spoke of low income people with disgust, and that I don’t need such shallow people in my life. 

After telling my sister the whole thing, she said it’s stupid to just cut them off for something so small and I was being an AH. I told her it’s not small to me, it’s a matter of morals. And that I have no interest in being friends with a couple mean girls.

64,1fft4tx,AITA for not letting my mom move in with me and my wife after my dad's death?,"First, some background on us:

I live in India, where living with your parents even after you're 18 is very common. Here, the marriage culture is that the parents look for a spouse for their child, without them having much say in it. Then the wife goes to live with her husband and his family. Both of these culture have declined in the past few decades though. All of this will be important later on.

My mom has always been on the clingier side. She was very sheltered since childhood. She was also reluctant to leave her parents after marriage as she was very attached to them. My parents later moved away from my dad's family because my dad had a transfer. They didn't have the best marriage. My dad has somewhat of a superiority complex and anger issues, and my mom was always let him have his way because she didn't want any conflicts. My dad had the final say in anything concerning me or my mom. This always led to a lot of conflicts in the family because unlike my mom, i didn't take my dad's shit positively.

I grew up very sheltered too, this especially affected me in my teens, as they never let me go out with friends till i was around 16-17, and even then i had restrictions on where and with whom i could go with my mom following and stalking me almost everywhere i went with friends.

My wife and I are high-school sweethearts and got married a year ago. I didn't want my mom to find out for obvious reasons. Romance, especially in teens in considered highly taboo in India. When my mom found out, her reason for not being too fond of her wasn't because it was considered taboo, but both of us (me and my wife) felt that she saw my wife as an opponent. This attitude didn't change during our marriage. She never outright said anything to us, but we could always feel it. My mom's attitude towards me always felt like borderline emotional incest.

My wife was very clear with me that she didn't want my mom living in the same house as us. Neither did I. My mom heavily opposed the idea, but my dad didn't let her move in with us because she didn't want her to third wheel us and as i've mentioned above, my mom always listens to my dad.

Now back to the present issue:

My dad's death hit all of us very hard, especially my mom. Me and my wife decided to let her live with us till we got her a flat close to ours, because my mom won't be able to live completely alone. My mom is aware of this and is constantly emotionally blackmailing me to let her live with me. She thinks i'm being heartless because when my grandfather passed away, my grandma lived with me and my parents and my parents had no problem and she doesn't get that we want privacy as a couple. This is where i brought up that she and my dad had an arranged marriage which is not the kind of marriage me and my wife have, and we need our privacy. Her guilt tripping and emotional blackmail isn't stopping, but me and my wife are adamant on not letting her live with us. AITA?

Edit: Thank you to all of those who responded. Your perspective and opinions on the matter have given me more clarity on what course of action I should take. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA for not letting my mom move in with me and my wife after my dad's death? First, some background on us:

I live in India, where living with your parents even after you're 18 is very common. Here, the marriage culture is that the parents look for a spouse for their child, without them having much say in it. Then the wife goes to live with her husband and his family. Both of these culture have declined in the past few decades though. All of this will be important later on.

My mom has always been on the clingier side. She was very sheltered since childhood. She was also reluctant to leave her parents after marriage as she was very attached to them. My parents later moved away from my dad's family because my dad had a transfer. They didn't have the best marriage. My dad has somewhat of a superiority complex and anger issues, and my mom was always let him have his way because she didn't want any conflicts. My dad had the final say in anything concerning me or my mom. This always led to a lot of conflicts in the family because unlike my mom, i didn't take my dad's shit positively.

I grew up very sheltered too, this especially affected me in my teens, as they never let me go out with friends till i was around 16-17, and even then i had restrictions on where and with whom i could go with my mom following and stalking me almost everywhere i went with friends.

My wife and I are high-school sweethearts and got married a year ago. I didn't want my mom to find out for obvious reasons. Romance, especially in teens in considered highly taboo in India. When my mom found out, her reason for not being too fond of her wasn't because it was considered taboo, but both of us (me and my wife) felt that she saw my wife as an opponent. This attitude didn't change during our marriage. She never outright said anything to us, but we could always feel it. My mom's attitude towards me always felt like borderline emotional incest.

My wife was very clear with me that she didn't want my mom living in the same house as us. Neither did I. My mom heavily opposed the idea, but my dad didn't let her move in with us because she didn't want her to third wheel us and as i've mentioned above, my mom always listens to my dad.

Now back to the present issue:

My dad's death hit all of us very hard, especially my mom. Me and my wife decided to let her live with us till we got her a flat close to ours, because my mom won't be able to live completely alone. My mom is aware of this and is constantly emotionally blackmailing me to let her live with me. She thinks i'm being heartless because when my grandfather passed away, my grandma lived with me and my parents and my parents had no problem and she doesn't get that we want privacy as a couple. This is where i brought up that she and my dad had an arranged marriage which is not the kind of marriage me and my wife have, and we need our privacy. Her guilt tripping and emotional blackmail isn't stopping, but me and my wife are adamant on not letting her live with us. AITA?

65,1ffslkz,AITA for telling on my husband?,"Just this past weekend, my husband went out on a boys day/night for a friend (already married but having the celebration this upcoming weekend). I had brought my daughter (2YO) to my mum's place as she's recovering from a stomach bug and I'd be alone in the afternoon to evening. 

On the way home from my mum's around 9pm, I started to feel sick with the same stomach bug in the taxi but I managed to rush back home carrying my sleeping daughter and stroller. I then proceeded to violently throw up for the next few hours, not being able to stomach even water, and finally caved at 1.30am asking him if he could cut his night short and come back since my daughter was still recovering (so fussing during the night) and I was just sick to my stomach. 

He only read my message at 2.59am saying he needed to find the guys he was with and only came home at 4.30am.

I told my mother and sister about it and how disappointed I felt that I couldn't depend on my husband to be there when I needed him the most. My husband said I shouldn't have told my sister and mother as it was none of their business, and how I happen to just conveniently fall sick on the night they were going out (they went out the past weekend as well already and will be going out again after the wedding next weekend)

AITA here?

Edit: perhaps I wasn't clear in my post - some people are saying I'm an AH for exposing my mother to the virus etc but she asked me to bring my daughter. Also the stomach virus can only be spread if she shared food etc so no - our taxi driver would not get sick just by being in the same space.

66,1ffshrj,AITA for not attending my cousins daughter's wedding?,"My mum learnt that a family member who had previously hurt me in the past was attending my cousin (Steph) daughter' (Rose) wedding. Hence, I expressed concerns of attending, as did my family. My younger brother volunteered to attend and represent all of us.

So in their next visit to Steph's home, my family had politely declined their rsvp to the reception, with the possibility of attending the ceremony. As they still wanted to show their love and support, and thought it might feel more comfortable to be in an open garden setting rather than a closed room reception. My brother would attend both. Steph's family seemed to understand.

After their visit, my family were dropped from all communications with Steph's family. We were not invited to Rose's hens. This hurt my family immensely and they took all of this as signs to not attend the ceremony. This had no affect on me as due to the past trauma with the mutual family member, I always felt excluded from Steph's family. Over the years it did hurt me to feel unwanted around them, and I would often blame myself for what had happened in the past. But as time went on, I grew to be happy in my own space and confident in the connections I had with other cousins. However, I was completely shocked and saddened for my family who for the first time were now experiencing the cold-shoulder and exclusion by Steph's family firsthand.

On the day of the wedding, Rose had unfriended me on social media, a day later or so, so did Steph. My family were upset on my behalf, but I started to feel awkward and embarrassed, as if old wounds were opening up again. Days later Rose had unfriended my mum and sister, but Steph did not. This confused and upset my mum even more.

Eventually my mum decided to message Steph, expressing sadness and confusion on what has come to be between their families but that she is fine with it, and she will always have love towards Steph and her family. Between multiple message exchanges, Steph had explained that Rose had unfollowed us because she was hurt that we didn't support her on her big day. Steph was hurt on her daughter's behalf as she felt that they had a strong bond between the families, excluding with me (yes, this was stated in her message). She confirmed that she won't unfriend my family but has with me, because she never felt connected with me as she did with my family and Rose had claimed I would make snide comments towards her throughout the years, Steph said this was possibly because of the bond my family had with Rose.

My mum explained that her family does include me and that I had raised the same concerns like Rose, so there was no point going back and forth as both parties will believe their own and so it's best to leave it as that. After reading the message exchange, with so much shock and wet eyes I thanked my mum for standing up for me.

Our first holiday together was in Jamaica and so we would like to do the celebration there March 2026.

On sharing the venue idea with my family, my sister's first reaction was about their family planning as her (F31) and her partner (M34) wish to have a baby. Due to the Zika risk, they will not be able to attend if she is pregnant. She just started a new job, and in order to have paid maternity leave, they cannot start trying until January 2025. This then leaves a short window for them to get pregnant, in order to have their baby ahead of the wedding in March 2026. She explained all of the above to me so I have the facts before making a final decision on our venue, she said she would be devastated if we pick Jamaica as it would be us picking a venue over her attendance.   
  
Due to weather and storm seasons in Jamaica we cannot move to a different month and would have to change the date to March 2027. This would mean delaying our wedding by an entire year which I don't really want to do.

70,1ffqycp,AITA for telling my roommate to go back home if she can’t handle college after she continuously whined?,"Let me start by saying this: I have been called a rude person in my past. Often times I blurt out things I think without thinking about if it would hurt in front of me.

Over the years I have gotten better at it though. This year I made it to my dream college. I come from an extremely low-income household, so I worked on scholarships, awards and much more to get into this college. I took student loans out to afford the remaining of my tuition. 

Now, for my freshman year roommate, I didn’t really try to find out if I could choose or anything, I went for someone random. The girl I am rooming with is quite the opposite as me.

She comes from a highly rich, well-to-do family. She honestly acts like a brat. I’ve constantly seen her lock down or hide her expensive jewellery as if she believes I will steal it.

She constantly talks about how she misses her home, the amenities and the people.

For the first week or so I understood, because I was homesick as well. But then into the 3rd and 4th week I’d walk into the room to see her crying about how tough it is having to do everything by herself.

She complains about the cost of Ubers, having to cook and clean herself.

By the second month I’d walked in to see her whine so many times that I finally told her, “Don’t come to college if you aren’t prepared, then. Go back home. You don’t need to whine about it so much when there’s a very simple solution available to you.”

She was visibly upset and left the room. I barely ever see her in our room anymore and she sleeps elsewhere, at first I didn’t care because she didn’t make it a big deal.

Yesterday, I asked a guy in one of my classes out; he was cute and sweet, we usually talked a lot during class and I wanted to pursue the relationship.

He rejected the offer (politely) and said one of the reasons was that 1) He wasn’t interested and 2) He heard I was a generally rude person to [my roommate].

I texted my roommate to ask why she was talking about me being rude. She said she was just talking to her friends about something that made her upset. 

However, I know for a fact she isn’t friends with the guy in my class as he mentioned he heard from someone neither of us knew.

 I’m honestly peeved and want to know if I was TA so I could consider apologising.

My grandmother was a very busy lady, and in her later years she had a difficult time doing the things she enjoyed and it was hard on her to miss out. We've always been close and I hated seeing her like that, but I lived too far away to meaningfully help. I asked if she'd be willing to move closer to me, and together we made the plan that she'd purchase a duplex in my city, my husband and I would live in one unit and she the other, and that we would pay rent to her (lower than typical for this area). We were near enough to help with things but had our own space away from her if we needed it. During this time our twins were born, and grandma was a huge help with them.

Recently, grandma passed, which was devastating. She left me the duplex, which wasn't a huge surprise but it is a big boon.  
Other than an amount for Nathan and Millie (6m and 6f)'s college, grandma didn't leave us any liquid assets. My sister Anne however did get money from her, presumably to make up for not getting the house, but idk how much.  
Anne also has a daughter Callie (4f) who got the same amount for college as my kids. Callie was concieved via a donor so no dad in the picture.  
Anne saw grandma more as a source of money than family, and they had a falling out when grandma refused to pay for her grad school (she paid for our undergrads). I don't think I ""deserve"" a house more than Anne, but I also see why grandma would have left it to me and not her.

Anne wants to move into the other unit of the duplex. She says she deserves to own a house just as much as me, and that she and Callie should be allowed to live here for free until she's saved up enough to buy her own. Unfortunately, my sister isn't very good with money and I don't believe that she'd really save- just enjoy the free rent indefinitely.   
The main reason we want to say no is that we wanted to rent out the other unit, and can't afford to have it draining our finances and making nothing back. We already offered to let Anne stay there at the same rent we were paying grandma, but she was offended by the suggestion that she have her younger sister as a landlord.

She also accused me of refusing because of racism towards Callie (who is half black, the rest are white). I'm hurt that my sister would think it's because of Callie, as I love my niece with all my heart. This is not the first time Anne has accused someone of racism towards Callie in an unrelated argument.

I'm also conflicted because my kids are very sad at the loss of grandma, and I think having their aunt & cousin nearby would help. My ideal would be Anne and Callie moving in and paying rent, but if my only options are to let Anne live there for free or to move in someone the kids don't know as well for rent, is it fair to the twins not to choose family? Is it fair to Anne to let her keep renting when I get to be a homeowner? Am I being racist? Am I disrespecting grandma?

73,1ffqpye,AITAH For Refusing to Cancel Child Support,"Throwaway Account:

I (34m) have been taking care of my sister's (32f) daughter for around 6 years. This all started when my sister got arrested for felony theft and drug charges. She's been a longtime addict, poor mouther, and family manipulator. No one else in my family stepped up, so I offered to take my niece in while my sister did drug treatment to avoid jail. From the beginning, my niece, then around 10, didn't want anything to do with her mom. I thought that was odd; but over the first few months I had her, my niece opened up about her mom having treated her very poorly. I sought a guardianship for my niece, and told my sister that I would not willingly send my niece back to her unless my sister got off the drugs and sorted her life out.

My sister initiated a legal fight with me to terminate the guardianship. I grew to love this kid like my own, and I didn't want to send her back to a bad environment. It cost me six figures over the course of a year-and-a-half in legal fees. I won. I managed to marshal substantial evidence of my sister's ongoing substance abuse and the court relied upon the report of a court-appointed guardian ad litem who reported favorably about my niece in my care and about my niece's negative view of her mother.

At some point in the legal process--as I was shelling out five-figure monthly legal bills--I learned that, as my niece's guardian, I was entitled to child support, so I filed the forms to seek it, and won it.

The state oversees the support award, and is apparently pretty thorough in seeking it. Garnishing paychecks and bank accounts. Now--years on--I am starting to get pressure from other family to forgive the child support. I have family reaching out to me saying my sister is doing better and just can't get ahead having to give up portions of her paycheck every month. With back amounts, it's like 30k in back support that I am owed. I don't need it, really, if I'm being honest. I make a good living--better than anyone else in my family has done.  
  
In all likelihood, sister's debt it will never be paid in full. But I don't want to let it go. I've started telling relatives, ""Hey--that's great that you want to help \[sister\]--why don't *you* pay me her 30k debt plus the present value of the award until niece is 18--and then I'll forgive \[sister's\] obligation."" Relatives have been huffy at that response.  
  
My sister initiated a fight with me knowing full well she was back on drugs, and lied about it, and got caught in open court. It was all a waste of a large amount of money, in my prime years, that I would have otherwise saved and set aside to retire on, or pay for my niece's education. I'm still mad about it, and my sister can owe me it forever for all I care. AITAH?

74,1ffqm0g,AITA for not babysitting my newborn brother?,"My(16f) stepmom(middle age f) had my step brother(4months) recently and I’ve been paid to babysit him here and there. 

However yesterday I had planned for a run in the evening. Basically verbatim
“Take care of your brother for a bit I have an important work errand”-stepmom
“No I’m going for a run”-me
“You don’t have a choice, it’s not even that important. my house my rules”-her
“I said no”-me

I just put on my headphones again and ignore her after that. Later on when I eating with my friends after the run I got bombarded by my dad for leaving my brother alone the whole evening. Apparently my step mom came home to my brother screaming and starving and his diapers full.

I argued I didn’t know she was actually leaving him behind and I had plan this run with my friends for a month since one of them is coming out for town. But they aren’t speaking to me or giving me allowances.

They said the instructions were given and I should have checked either ways before leaving the house. So AITA?

1. My friend is visiting me for the first time in a year and I did inform them.
2. No my stepmom do not pay for me at all. This house was passed on to my dad by my grandpa and mom. Most of the money my dad gave me are from the heritance my grandpa left me. I can’t access it myself though. My stepmom do not pay for my utilities or anything. Maybe babysitting and it’s usually very little
3. Since everyone kept asking who left first I went back to check the camera. Btw I was very excited to see my friend so I didn’t check. So yes I did leave before my stepmom. But my step brother(entirely my step mom son 22) was at home the WHOLE time. He usually only comes home at midnight and game so I’m going to confront them and him.
4. My dad was home too. He left after both me and my mom left. I thought I heard the TV on before I left.

Update: I’m too tired to argue with them. They kept bringing up I was 16 and responsible enough to check every room in the house before leaving and jumping back to I’m only 16 and I should listen to the adults. As for my step brother, he said he was gaming with his headphones and couldn’t hear anything and my parents deflect it back on saying I was the one who was told to get the job done.

Either ways I’m not in a position to refuse their orders, so yeah. But I will check on my half brother the next time I got to leave.

So ill tell you my expirience so tou can prepare/think were do you want to have The expirience

When a child cried any age or reason The teacher imidiate responce is tho yell at The child For crying and tell them to stop crying wiht boys The teachers would tell them to be more strong and to not be weak or show emotion.
They would also mock The childs crying by mimicing it. 

The food was absolutely disgusting or just edible and if a child didn’t like it or want to eat it then they would take the food away and let them starve but the thing is the teachers them selves wouldn’t eat the food they always said that it’s disgusting food so if they can’t eat it why/how do they expect a child to eat it.


Speaking of the kids they have no manners and are the biggest brats it the world but I’ll cut them sum slack cause well they kids.

Working conditions were terrible I was supposed to have a 1.30 minute break or a fifteen minute break every hour plus one 30 minute break but I had one 1.30 hours break but out of that I had maybe a 30 min break because the second a clid woke up I had to come to the rooms but I was so tired 
But I was practically an extra so leagally even if I wasn’t there they would still be in ratio but still I had to be there.


So now that you know what it was like I’ll thell you the story so after the week I had to write my expirience for a school website for my city and apparently a lot of people had the same experience so I got a message from the nursery manager to please take down the report because apparently parents didn’t know that the kids were treated like this so a lot of parents took the kids out of that nursery.
I said no and she got mad and tried emailing my teacher but they didn’t answer and I blocked them so am I the asshole?

And unfortunately this isn’t the first time we’ve gotten a letter like this.

Which has resorted in a very big level of tension with my brother (34) and sister in law (29) being very anxious and taking out on everyone. My sister in law suggested that for once a month on a Sunday we all take a day and clean together. I agreed that I absolutely did need to do more, and was happy to be more active with house work but I wouldn’t do it on a Sunday and not all together.

Now two reasons firstly I work a very physical labour job, and really don’t wanna get up at 4am the next day to go to my job after having spent all Sunday cleaning. Whingy I acknowledge this. Second reason my brother has severe OCD so cleaning like this results in a lot of tension and stress as we can never clean to his standard, and cleaning things in communal areas like say the bathroom, I cleaned the mirror and he then proceeded to throw all of his and his wife’s products out after I had moved them as I had ‘contaminated them’ or that I hadn’t stored them correctly and they would have cleaning products on them. 

I suggested a chore chart where once a month each member of the house is assigned 2-3 of these tasks that way we can all do our fair share and I don’t risk upsetting my brother in any way shape or form. My sil has her heart set on the idea of us all cleaning together, and it’s just set up a whole other argument of them ‘shouldering all the work’ because I want my weekends to remain my time.

Me: “Who put Tanks collar on? I’m letting his neck fur grow?”
B: “Me”
Me: “Why? He has it off for a reason?”
B: “I was telling him off for eating the cat biscuits. I couldn’t grab him”
Me: “Okay but don’t put his collar on when you are telling him off. Otherwise he would associate his collar has a punishment”
B: “I dragged him to tell him off”
Me: “Could’ve used a lead not his collar”
 
Thats not the full conversation as it’s kinda long but that main part. The main reason I got so annoyed is because I’m so sick of people not listening to me about my dog. Especially this one person who “has a fully trained dog” they don’t and judge me for how my dog is trained.

Before this, I lived on my own for several years and paid for everything. 

I know I sound spoiled. She has given me an opportunity that most people dream about, and I recognize that. However, it feels like I am trading away my freedom and individuality.

Examples:

I have a limited amount of days that I am allowed to leave the house. I have to ask permission and check in with both her and my sister (same age) before making any plans. 

When I voted she checked my ballet and told me who/what I had to vote for or else there would be problems.

My closet is regularly inspected. Clothes must be folded perfectly and organized by color, season, occasion, long/ short sleeve, etc.

My room decorations and their placement must be approved and my things are regularly moved around by her.

All of my things are inspected weekly. 

I am not supposed to attend any events or locations with alcohol present unless my sister attends.

When guests come over (even strangers) I am to immediately allow them to check out my room for a house tour.

I attend school full time and if I finish all of my assignments for the week (20+ hours) I am ridiculed as a disappointment when I indulge in free time. 

I must report on my sex life with updates on my girlfriends birth control. We use protection but this is not sufficient and my mom regularly digs for details.

If we are out in public I am to be social and quiet behavior is frowned upon. I am to cut my hair and dress properly. I must contact any person my mom believes will be beneficial to my career (usually strangers).

My mom claims I need a new therapist because my current therapist suggested we establish personal boundaries. 

I must cancel any plans and stay home if we have unexpected guests.

I cannot miss phone calls or sleep in.

She is not okay with me moving out and shuts down any mediation attempt. I risk losing access to my financial support for school, my inheritance to the family business and our properties, and my trust fund. I still have two and a half years of school left.

81,1ffozar,AITAH for asking my friend to move seats at the valedictorian awards?,"
---

I (17F) am in my final year of high school, and the valedictorian awards are coming up. My best friend (also 17F) and I were discussing the event, and she expressed her disinterest in attending, planning to sit at the back and wait for the pledge signing. I understand, as she isn't an achiever and won't receive any awards.

However, I've worked hard and participated in many extracurricular activities, so I know I'll receive an award. I'll need to go on stage multiple times, and sitting at the back would be inconvenient. When I suggested we sit in front, my friend accused me of trying to brag about my achievements and said I've never been supportive of her.

Honestly, I have been supportive - I've helped her with notes, study sessions, and more since the beginning of high school. But she hasn't been equally supportive of my achievements, often just smiling and looking away when I share my good news.

So, AITAH for asking my friend to move seats? Was I being reasonable, or was I being an a**hole?

EDIT: I've seen some comments suggesting we just sit separately, but it's not that simple. We've both tried suggesting that, but we don't really have other friends to sit with, and when I brought it up, she accused me of being a bad friend and said it would only increase her anxiety in that situation.

82,1ffojdx,AITA for standing up for my girlfriend and ruining her friendship in the process? ,"Hi everyone. So this is going to be a bit long, but details are important. This story includes me(30M), my girlfriend (26F), her friend (30F) who we will name Leah, and her friend’s boyfriend(32M) who we will name Adam.

My girlfriend is a pretty fit girl, she has never been fat, but a year ago she was a bit chubby, and lost 10kgs during the last year eating healthy and lifting weights. (This info is important to the story)

We all had a good relationship between the four of us, I met them through my girlfriend, they were friends of hers way before we got into a relationship. 

We got along pretty well so we started hanging out and doing double dates. In thouse double dates Adam started to act weird around my gf, he started making comments about her weight, how she looked sick, that she should eat more, making “this all you gonna eat” comments, etc. My gf decided to ignore him because she didn’t want to make things weird with her friend Leah, so she just brushed the guy off and I decided to ignore him too to avoid drama the first times this started to happen.

Then, this didn’t only happen in person, Adam started to text my girl. He replied to her gym Whatsapp status, telling her that her ribs show and stuff. My gf after receiving so many comments decided to tell him to stop, because it was getting uncomfortable. He told her that if she’s posting pics online she should be able to deal with the comments. She also decided to text Leah about it and told her the situation and she just replied “He’s like that, he can’t keep his thoughts to himself, just block him”. 

Dude continued to text my girlfriend despite her telling him comments on her weight makes her uncomfortable - so i decided to step in. I texted him telling him that I don’t think that’s a good friend type of behavior, that he should really stop and respect my partner. He then started to say how he was worried because he thought my girlfriend had body dysmorphia (wtf?). I told him how dare he diagnose her with body dysmorphia just for being thin. He then said he was free to say whatever the “fuck” he wanted, literally. And that if we didn’t like it then we shouldn’t talk to him. 

I was very angry at this reply, since I tried to respectfully tell him to back off - he didn’t listen, so I told him children were the only ones who verbalized all their thoughts. Parts of being an adult were to know what to say and when to say it. I told him I had a few thoughts about him and his girlfriend that I never say, because of respect. 

Context: they both are overweight. Adam doesn’t do shit to improve his lifestyle. 

But then i DID tell him I thought he was a fat asshole that didn’t do shit for his life. But you weren’t seeing me stalking him about it or commenting about it. I then blocked him and my gf did too.

Right after this fight my girlfriend noticed Leah blocked her. I now feel bad that I may have ruined my gfs friendship with Leah, but I was pissed to see this dude disrespect her.

83,1ffohjb,WIBTA for uninviting my fiancé from my graduation? ,"For a little context: I am graduating from post-secondary education tomorrow and it has been *rough*. I don’t want to give up too much info, but most people would agree that it is one of the more difficult programs to complete. 
Aside from that, but still relevant to the situation, I have a lot of parental trauma from both sides. It’s not debilitating in every day life anymore as an adult, but certain triggers can open up old scars as I found out today.  

Our years-long relationship has been good overall- typical ups and downs, but nothing majorly wrong. My partner has been supportive throughout my academic course, but today we had a short but very explosive argument. It started off as a small matter (something to do with the cat), which I admittedly fueled with my own petty actions- I was being a brat for sure, but I did not raise my voice nor did I make any personal attacks. It then quickly spiraled out of control. Nothing physical happened but he FLEW off the handle and said some very precisely hurtful words at an extreme volume. He ended up going for a walk to cool off, which was good, but it left me with a familiar feeling. What he said and how he said is extremely close to things my parents would say to me. He didn’t do it on purpose- he doesn’t know much about my parents’ emotional abuse bc it’s hard for me to talk about it even in therapy, but replaying through the argument makes me want to run and hide like I used to. With the last few weeks being so stressful (finals, papers, etc) I don’t have the mental/emotional capacity to process this right now, but even if I did it would take a while- more time than what I have before the ceremony. 

Now, as I’ve mentioned before- I am quite proud of my accomplishment. I’ve earned it with *literal* blood, sweat, and tears. Obviously it’s a special day and with all of this I think him being there would be upsetting. I’ve never been good at short term suppression- people say I’ve got a face with subtitles and can always tell what I’m feeling whether I want to show it or not. He is sorry, but the icky feeling isn’t going away. This is very likely to be the last graduation for me and I feel conflicted about excluding him from such a big life event over one argument.

84,1ffobdy,AITA for not telling my friend her Ex started dating someone,"I had two friends, Maria and James, who had been in a relationship for six years before I met them. I was closer to Maria, but still considered James a good friend. When James broke up with Maria, I invited her over for movies and ice cream. I asked if I had to pick a side, but Maria said, ""No, James is a good guy, it just sucks we're not together."" I was relieved and happy to stay friends with both of them.

After the breakup, James and I got closer. Maria quickly started seeing someone new and asked me to keep it a secret from James. I didn't feel it was my place to tell, so I respected her wishes, though I did question if she was ready to move on.

Three months later, Maria was still seeing this guy but had started badmouthing James, which I avoided getting involved in since I was now closer to him. I made it clear to Maria that I didn't want to take sides and refused to participate in her rants, thinking this was her way of coping.

Around this time, my friend Josie came over and revealed she had started seeing James. I was a little surprised but ultimately happy for them, especially since (i thought) Maria had moved on so quickly. Josie asked me to keep their relationship private since it was still new, and I agreed, just like I had with Maria. I did tell Josie I wouldn't lie if Maria asked me directly, and she respected that.

Two more months passed, and it was nearing Christmas. Maria had stopped seeing her new guy, and I had gotten much closer to Josie. I was invited to spend Christmas Eve at her house, which meant a lot because the holidays are tough for me. Josie and James still hadn't told anyone they were dating and were going to post that they were together once the holidays were over, as they also didnt want this to affect Marias holidays

The night before Christmas Eve, I got a drunk audio message from Maria saying she found out about Josie and James. I responded the next morning, saying I couldn’t be there for her that day because I was celebrating Christmas. Later, I sent another message explaining I was at Josie's for the holiday and was happy to answer any questions. Maria responded, ""I don’t need your answers; everyone’s told me enough. Please stop contacting me now,"" and then blocked me on all social media.

She is great and I usually maybe once a month check up on my ex to make sure shes doing okay. I know that she has been going through a rough time ever since we broke up. Now my girlfriend doesn't care, she understands me that I have no intentions getting back with her. But I just want to know, should I stop and just completely leave the past? I feel bad in many ways because I believe I did many things wrong in the past relationship and every time i think of it, I want to make it up in some ways.",1.0,1.0629554986953735,1,1
87,1ffnf6a,WIBTA if I tell my ex-fiancé’s family that he cheated ,"(Side note: I’m Catholic and I would appreciate if anyone has any Bible-based reasons why I should/shouldn’t do this!) 

Basically, he was cheating a few months before and after proposing to me. I found out recently (2 months after the proposal). This was a complete shock because we have had so many conversations in the past 7 (!!!) years about how horrible cheating is. 

But anyways, it bothers me that his family doesn’t know yet. It’s been almost 3 weeks. Only his mom knows - he was forced to tell her when I popped up at his house and was going to tell her myself. I’m not staying with him, so they’re going to know at some point. I don’t think he’s going to tell them because he doesn’t have the best relationship with all of them, just his mom. I haven’t told my family yet because I know they’ll be devastated and I just want to be ready for that conversation. 

My reason for not telling them myself would mostly be because I don’t want to cause issues within their family (his dad cheated on his mom many years ago and things have been messy ever since). Also because I don’t know if that’s right to do as a Catholic. I feel like I should let God handle it. 

I don’t even know if/how I should say goodbye to them and thank them for everything over the years. 

He’s planning on going to therapy because he feels remorse and “feels like a monster” and knows he has issues to address. So even though I’m very angry, confused, and heartbroken, I don’t want to make things worse for him mental-health-wise, which I think would happen if I told his family. I feel like he’s really fragile right now and I do want him to heal whatever issues he has.

I don't live with him, his wife and my stepsister (16), but since she's really young and they are a little abusive with her I try to hang out with her when I can, we recently hangout and she told me that in one conversation with her mom she started saying ""You are starting to look fat, and that way to dress, you are starting to look like X (me)""

I know it's a small comment, and something probably stupid, but I never talk about her or my dad at all, I know what she means, I grew up hearing it from my own mom ""you look fat"" ""you need to dress more feminine"" ""no one is going to date you if you still looking like that"", the problem here is, they kicked me out of home, they said horrible things to me in the past, now I'm helping them to keep the house that they are struggling to pay (letting my dad borrow my money because he have no credit left), and she have a little ""business"" (not really a business imo) where when i can i buy stuff from.

He also refuses to sit down and make a plan with me bc he’s “too busy” but claims he’ll have time for the baby. I haven’t seen him in over a month and anytime we try to text or call it just ends in a fight bc he’s expecting me to make all the compromises. After begging him to start helping me for over a month I just asked him to sign away his rights and he’s acting like I’m in the wrong bc I told him if I’m forced to go through pregnancy alone then I’m going to go through parenting alone.

96,1ffmyht,AITA for changing my mind on a roommate?,"I (24m) am in my first ever apartment rental, 2 bed, 1 bath, garage, large backyard, and the rent is $1400 a month plus electric and garbage

A little over a month ago I was sent a post on Facebook about a 32 year old guy looking for a room to rent who just happens to be a semi regular customer in the store I'm a supervising shift lead in

I make $2200 a month if I'm lucky and have a $400 a month debt I have to pay and have two cats that run another $100+ for litter, food, etc so I jumped at the idea of having him rent the other room

I've also been letting my co-workers 20 year old daughter crash on my couch until she went to job corps but she changed her mind and now wants to join the lease

I've been in this place for 2 months and she's stayed for about a month and a half total so we've gotten relatively close and become friends

The guy is a recovering addict and alcoholic and is six months sober, and while I believe any time spent clean and sober is fantastic, I can't help but feel like that's not enough time to guarantee that it won't enter my home
He also told me his last (third in 6 years) DUI might cause him to spend some time in jail but he's not sure yet

Originally the company I rent through denied him but now he's saying they are reconsidering
The reason they denied him is because his last rental went south after he started using again when his girlfriend of 5 years broke up with him and he caused some property damage which does concern me

I'm also reconsidering and would honestly prefer my coworkers daughter to rent the other room

I've made sure to have her mom, my co-worker, ask her what her plan is and her wants and to make sure she knows that if she joins the lease that she can't back out of it and she understands and wants to join it

I haven't been told I'm an asshole but I can't help but feel like I AM one for changing my mind cause both people need a home

Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA for changing my mind on a roommate? I (24m) am in my first ever apartment rental, 2 bed, 1 bath, garage, large backyard, and the rent is $1400 a month plus electric and garbage

A little over a month ago I was sent a post on Facebook about a 32 year old guy looking for a room to rent who just happens to be a semi regular customer in the store I'm a supervising shift lead in

I make $2200 a month if I'm lucky and have a $400 a month debt I have to pay and have two cats that run another $100+ for litter, food, etc so I jumped at the idea of having him rent the other room

I've also been letting my co-workers 20 year old daughter crash on my couch until she went to job corps but she changed her mind and now wants to join the lease

I've been in this place for 2 months and she's stayed for about a month and a half total so we've gotten relatively close and become friends

The guy is a recovering addict and alcoholic and is six months sober, and while I believe any time spent clean and sober is fantastic, I can't help but feel like that's not enough time to guarantee that it won't enter my home
He also told me his last (third in 6 years) DUI might cause him to spend some time in jail but he's not sure yet

Originally the company I rent through denied him but now he's saying they are reconsidering
The reason they denied him is because his last rental went south after he started using again when his girlfriend of 5 years broke up with him and he caused some property damage which does concern me

I'm also reconsidering and would honestly prefer my coworkers daughter to rent the other room

The older brother had kinda simillar stuff happening to him, he was kicked out at 19 , beaten up by my mom and father (so was I whenever they were drinking). I didn’t kept in touch with them until I was 19 and it was because of a girlfriend witch I was with at the time, she talked me into trying to fix things or atleast talk to her once in a while.

98,1ffmsaj,AITA for showering late?,"
My suitemate and I have been best friends since high school and shared a double room last year. This year, we each have our own single rooms, along with three other girls. Our rooms are next to each other, with mine across from the bathroom and hers near the vanity/sink. 

I often take late showers due to my busy schedule, usually around 11 pm or later. Since we roomed together last semester, she knows this and was similarly busy then. However, two days ago, when I texted her that I was about to shower, she asked me not to because it was late and she was going to sleep. I was confused because I wasn’t making any excessive noise—just running water. 

She got into an argument with me, claiming I was inconsiderate and didn’t plan well. The argument lasted about half an hour, and I eventually took my shower. Afterward, I saw a dozen missed texts from her, saying things like ""I’m in tears"" and ""I’m just trying to sleep."" I was surprised because I had been quiet, and I continued with my night routine, which led to more texts accusing me of disturbing her sleep. 

Two days later, while brushing my teeth around 11:45 pm, I heard her sigh dramatically from her room. I decided to skip the shower that night to avoid another argument, but even brushing my teeth seemed to upset her. I feel it's unreasonable for her to expect me to rearrange my schedule and compromise my hygiene over minor noise from down the hall. I pay for my housing as well and believe I should be able to use the bathroom whenever needed. AITA for sticking to my schedule?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-13,"AITA for showering late?

100,1ffmij7,AITA for leaving without giving them more time to explain?,"For the last 4 years, I've been building a career with someone I considered my best friend.

 In January, my business partner Jay started putting off their part of our work until the very last second. I brought this up to them and explained that not getting a chance to see their work before the deadline made me feel really disrespected. They said they’d try to do better.

The next week, they texted me the morning of a big presentation that their work wouldn't be done and they wouldn't be able to present. They said they'd been ""having a lot of complicated feelings"" that they ""weren't ready to talk about.""

I was really upset, especially because we had just had a conversation about this. I decided to just go ahead and do the presentation, filling in their part of the work as best I could. (They were not happy with me for my ‘the show must go on’ attitude.)

When we got a chance to talk about it, Jay apologized, but said that they were upset with me for not being more understanding because they were having a mental health crisis. I expressed my sympathy and said that I wish they had told me they were having a mental health crisis, because I would have offered my support. I also explained that I had no idea what ""complicated feelings"" meant and that I'd spent the last week trying to figure it out.

Jay maintained that I was responsible for hurting them because I’m Autistic and didn’t read between the lines.

After that, we spent a lot of time talking about being honest and building back trust. But they continued finishing things hours before our presentations. And they lied to me for 7 months and dated my sister behind my back. 

Recently, shortly after my grandfather died, Jay picked a fight with me over a creative disagreement when they knew I was having a bad grief day. This was the straw that broke me. I sent a long but kind email spelling out the ways in which our partnership had become unbalanced and asking them for some kind of change. After 2 weeks, the only reply I got was them texting that they were cancelling all plans to do with our project and they weren’t ready to talk and “thank you for your understanding.”

I've spent so much of this year crying and trying to figure out what's going on with them. My mental health is the worst it's been in years. After that text, I couldn’t handle it anymore and told them that for the sake of my mental health, I had to be done.

Now I’m wondering if I was wrong to make that decision when I was still so hurt and sad. In my original email I said “take all the time you need to process this” but then I guess I retroactively applied a two week time limit? Idk. A simple “I’m sorry for hurting you and I want to make changes, I just need a little more time to process” would have been fine, but instead they cancelled everything and expected more understanding from me with no explanation, just like before.

101,1ffmfh5,AITA I invited my friend over to my aunts house for a small party before I knew it my aunt was kicking her out of the house ,"Hi I am 23 female. My aunt is 42 female and my friend is 23 female. 

Back in the summer my aunt would have small get togethers with maybe ten people or less at her house. We would drink have bonfires and just hang out at the house and listen to music. One night I decided to invite my friend over because my aunt said it was okay. For reference my cousins were there one with her boyfriend and one with the guy she was talking to and his friend lets call him Luke. Luke is a good looking guy he’s just a little young and dumb he’s 19 while everyone was older. My aunt had her eye on him but he assured me nothing was going to happen between them because he wasn’t attracted to her and he never acted like he was she just thought he was cute and fun to flirt with when they would drink. My friend knew that my aunt kinda sorta had a thing for him but had known him before my aunt through Snapchat. 

Once everyone had a few beers and it got later my friend showed up after a sneaky link with some random guy. When she got there she had two twelve packs of beer so we broke into them and started chugging. Before I knew it all us girls were in the hot tub my aunt included. Music was blasting then the guys came outside Luke was wasted!! My friend and him were talking and he was being flirty with her which made my aunt mad so she got out of the hot tub and went to her room before anything happened my friend went to her room and said can I go for it with luke my aunt angrily said I don’t give a fuck so my friend and I went back outside I stayed in the hot tub to try to prevent them from doing anything that might piss my aunt off. Everyone else was in bed at this point. After some time passed Luke and my friend start kissing so I leave and go to my aunts room and she is livid that they are about to do the nasty in her hot tub!! Before I knew it they were gone and had went to his car parked out front of the house. My aunt and I heard Luke screaming through the window and before we knew it they were doing the nasty it lasted about an hour and they came back inside and sat there like nothing happened. They didn’t say a word and we all sat there awkwardly. My aunt stole their vapes and watched them look for them and told them karma was a bitch and she wasn’t giving them back. My friend asks for her vape back and my aunt says get your stinky whore pussy out of my fucking house to both of them. I am silent and my friend leaves. 

Afterwards the next day my friend tells me she’s not going to put me in the middle of her and my aunts problems and I agree that’s for the best. But even though my aunt apologized my friend saw I was with her because I was with some family for Fourth of July and was upset with me for being around her even tho she apologized and I told her there was going to be times I was going to be around my aunt because she is family and I still want to see and hang out with my cousins when if my aunt happens to be there I thought she understood but she made me feel like I was the asshole so Am I?

In 2019, Ina starts seeing this guy that she met on tetris online and has been having an online relationship. We live in Canada (BC) but the guy lives in England but for 2 years, she's been going back and forth to meet him. During that time, I thought it was odd but was supportive. After 2yrs, she and tetris broke up because she emotionally cheated on him with a guy she met on LOL. Again, thought it was odd but knew tetris wouldn't last anyways.

Ina dated league for 3 years but had many problems and fights (won't get into any of that) but eventually after a lot of breaking up and getting back together, they finally ended. I said she should try dating people in person because these online dates have been going nowhere. I thought that's the end of her onling dating journey but again she tells me that she met someone on discord (2024).

Ina met Jim(18m). She said that she loves him and has a strong connection. After a week of dating, she said that he cheated on her and almost break up but she decided to forgive him. On the side, she secretly hooked up with some random guy from a dating app. After a couple of weeks she asks my bf to be in gc with Jim because he's difficult to talk to. I thought that's odd considering how defensive she was about having such a great connection with this guy.

My bf and I were why are you talking to this kid at all and she said ""oh we just play games together"". Thought it was weird but let it go and later in the evening we drive to get a snack. On the drive, Ina says ""Was afraid this might happen"" and we're like ""what?"" she said ""15yr said he likes me"". I was shocked cause why would you talk to a kid enough for him to start catching feelings for you? After a couple of days she sends a msg to our group chat of a sc of Jim(18m) calling 15yr old out in a public discord chat threatening him to stay away from Ina and stop dreaming about her and a bunch of other curses. That's when I decided to be honest and tell her that this love triangle with kids was weird and that she shouldn't be talking to them at all.

104,1fflxl3,AITA for taking part of my daughter’s settlement money to pay for her tuition after she failed the school year?,"So, my (49F) daughter (16F) won a decent amount of money from a personal injury settlement a few years ago. Since she is a minor the money has been in an account that I planned to keep until she turned 18. My plan was always to give it to her once she’s an adult so she can use it for whatever she wants—whether that’s college, a car, or just saving it for the future as long as she’s using it responsibly.

But she didn’t put in the bare minimum effort and she knows that, she has now begun to repeat the year. The tuition for her school isn’t cheap, and we’ve already paid for all her years until now.

I decided that since she failed and has to repeat the year and lied about it, I’m going to take this extra year’s worth of tuition out of her settlement money. She flipped out, saying the money is hers and I’m “stealing” it when both me and her dad have agreed on keeping that specific amount. She told her older brother that he should ""enjoy university"" because ""her money's paying for it."" 
This just goes to show that she has no concept of money because if she knew how much university tuition costs she wouldn't be saying this, not to mention her brother was and has always been a better student.

105,1fflr8h,AITA for not buying a birthday present,"I never really had a large friend group, so I never wanted large birthday parties growing up. I tended to celebrate with family and close friends. A few years ago, I met some people via school.  We became close over a group project, and have remained good friends ever since. Last year, we started sharing lunch on our birthdays (or as close to the date as possible). The four of us have birthdays in the following order: Jasmine, Lauren, Me, Sarah. For Jasmine’s birthday, we decided to pool together to buy a present and pay for her meal. By Lauren’s birthday, we each found a small gift to give. When my birthday came around, I was out of town so we postponed lunch a few weeks so that we were all free. The day of my belated lunch, the others were half an hour late. There was no present, card, or even “Happy Birthday!” shared. I assumed money was tight, so I didn’t mention anything, even though I was devastated. With Sarah’s birthday only about two weeks after, I was still upset and neglected to buy a gift (I just gave my regards). No one else offered anything more than a passing “Happy Birthday!” Now that Jasmine’s birthday is coming up, we have all made time to celebrate together. Since Jasmine has been busy, I have stepped in to plan the outing (with her suggestion about what kind of food to eat). I have been doing this while working many hours and taking classes again now that school has resumed. Lauren has suggested that we each give Jasmine a gift so she feels celebrated. I told Lauren that I felt that I had no intention of buying a present as I was planning everything and getting a card for us to sign together. Lauren thinks that I’m being cheap and unsupportive. I didn’t want to upset her about how I felt disrespected by them on my birthday, as I thought it would make me seem entitled and spoiled.

107,1ffko1c,AITA for making my ex coworker uncomfortable with something that I said. ,"I am a 20 male who worked at a bowling alley. I am in a shift lead position and usually manage children’s birthday parties. One of the people under me, 18 female, had invited me to her highschool play performance the day before. I want to preface that me and this co worker were very good friends, I have considered her like a little sister to me and we have shared many great memories and conversations, so this was nothing out of the ordinary. The play was mean girls and as most high school plays go, it was pretty alright. My coworker was playing the dumb one of the main character (I forgot her name) and was doing a pretty good job. As the nature of the movie goes, there are some things that sexualize the characters in the movie so the play had some of those characteristics too. My co worker, being one of the main characters, was walking around and to me seemed like she was overly arching her back to stick butt out while she walked to really get into her character. I noticed this and it made me uncomfortable because they are sexualizing teenagers in high school. Anyways the play ends and I see her the next morning at work. She naturally asked me what I thought and I told her straight up that it was good but I didn’t like how you were “sticking your butt out” and that they were “sexualizing high schoolers” she said she wasn’t doing that and I said “oh well it looked like it to me” and went on with my shift. Now this is nothing out of the realm of what we say to each other because we are so close. But after telling her that she and another co worker turned nearly the whole facility and every other co worker against me because I “was not supposed to be looking at her butt”. Which I think is stupid because I can see someone’s whole body on a stage. Every single one of my co workers immediately saw me as a bad guy, and some of my closest friends/ coworkers also turned against me. It got so bad that managers had to get involved. Before I got any talking to or warning I ended up quitting because I started to hate that job before hand and wanted to quit anyways, this was just the tipping point for me. No one has reached out, apologized, and no one stood up for me and I feel very betrayed. As time goes on I have heard that more and more co workers that I thought were some of my really good friends totally turned there back to me.

109,1ffkfb2,AITA for not letting my (18F) boyfriend (18M) drink alcohol?,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend (18M) since 2022. He started occasionally drinking around July, nothing crazy but it was a bit of a shock to me & I made it pretty clear to him that it made me uncomfortable. We talked about it, & the conversation boiled down to him telling me to “get over myself” about it, so I backed off. Whatever, I’m an anxious person so I understood where he was coming from, and he was understanding during this conversation as well. He had asked me if I didn’t want him to drink outright, & in retrospect I should’ve said yes in the moment, but I’m very conflict avoidant and I didn’t want him to feel like I was being controlling. I told him it was fine, that this is a me problem, & I should get used to it so long as he doesn’t overdo it. We were both happy with this.

Shortly after starting a new job last month, however, he stole some whiskey from his brother, had way too much, & threw up while on FaceTime with me. While I was talking to him he kept telling me that he felt bad about drinking because he knew I didn’t like it, but when I tried to discuss it the next day, he got defensive & totally shut me down. He said he was just trying to relax after work. (The first bad day you have at your first full-time job, you immediately go steal alcohol? Whatever.) 

Yesterday, after another bad day, he mentioned getting a drink while I was on the phone with him, & while I didn’t outright say I didn’t want him to, it was obvious by the tone of my voice after he mentioned it & he got the message. He didn’t get a drink but I could tell he was irritated about it & the conversation dwindled afterwards. We’ve been passively texting throughout the day as per usual as though nothing happened, so I don't think he's still upset about it now but idk. 

What I haven’t mentioned is that his mother used to be an alcoholic, & addiction runs in his family. He has little impulse control & basically does whatever he wants whenever he wants, very spontaneous. His parents don’t pay much attention to what he’s up to, the only thing they don’t want him doing is drinking underage, & here he is. Drinking. They don’t know about it.

On one hand, he’s only 18, has a high risk of addiction, & a general lack of impulse control. I don’t think that can lead to anything good. We’re serious about our relationship & I don’t think I could take it if he ends up dependent on alcohol, but I’m so scared he will. On the other hand, he’s just trying to relax after work. Am I just a controlling bitch who won’t let my boyfriend relax? Am I letting my anxiety get the best of me? I have absolutely no idea & I have no one to talk to about this. We really do love each other a lot & we want more than anything to make this work.

My (28f) father (63m) is very physically disabled due to poorly controlled diabetes. He's also been a cocaine addict for most of my life and completely destroyed the family financially, emotionally, etc.

Previously, his side of the family (VERY well off financially) hadn't known about his addiction until my oldest sibling and I told them about 9 months ago. 

Up until this point, I'd been helping financially(just food stuff purely for the sake of my mother-moved out 6 months ago, disabled due to psychiatric issues) and physically.This included going to pick up medications, buy groceries, do things around the house, help with the pets, etc.

Once I told his side of the family, my expectation was that they would be the ones to exclusively care for my father (financially and hired help, i really didnt care anymore). They'd already hired a nurse to handle medical logistics, take him to appointments and a cleaner for the house.

His side of the family told me that they just want me to work on rebuilding the relationship and they would handle everything else.

Even now, they're asking me to take him shopping for special shoes, going over to change his medical sensors, mailing returns for clothes they buy him that don't end up fitting, etc. I've already told him that I won't be helping with things he CAN still do (dropping return packages, picking up his meds, taking his car to get washed). Inevitably, when he DOESNT do those things, his family comes and lectures me that I still need to be kind and do things for others even when they don't do anything to help themselves.

I hang out/eat meals with him 2x week where he always asks for help around the house and I feel that's enough already.

My daughter and the dog have also met before and the dog is absolutely in love with my daughter. We also have 4 small dogs at home. My MIL didn’t do anything wrong with showing her the dogs or comforting her. I purely just wanted and needed to comfort my own daughter. My husband also agrees that I did nothing wrong with comforting our daughter.

So AITA for wanting to comfort my own daughter?",0.0,1.0529358386993408,1,0

( I am an 18F and my “brother” is 17M) For some context a few months ago my buddy got kicked out and has been living with me and my mom and I think of him like a brother. Tonight I was peeing before I got into the shower, mind you I was completely unclothed and told him and my boyfriend that I was going to go take a quick shower, and my “brother” came banging on the door saying he had to pee too, I told him I was just going to take a quick shower and he could either wait or go to the gas station right up the road. My mom was yelling at me to get into the shower and let him in to use the bathroom and I kept saying no and they both kept yelling at me and my buddy stormed off calling me a greedy bitch for hogging the bathroom and an asshole and just about everything else he could think of to call me. To avoid further confrontation I didn’t say that I wasn’t comfortable with him coming in while I was showering because I know it would lead to another big blow up again. It’s not that I thought he would do something or anything like that it’s just because that seemed weird to me and I wasn’t comfortable with it. So I locked the door got into the shower and was out of the bathroom in less than 10 minutes. I don’t like nor want anyone else in the bathroom if I’m showering or using the bathroom or anything like that it’s not just the fact that it was him. So am I the asshole because I didn’t want him coming into the only bathroom in the house to pee while I was showering? 


Edit:
So for those of you saying why didn’t I put my clothes back on and leave the bathroom it’s because I have sensory issues and I was actually going to the shower to “wash off the bad textures” I had made dinner for my mom and bf before he (my buddy/“brother”) came home and felt gross and sweaty and had some food and whatnot on me from cooking. Also I’m not a small person and we don’t have towels big enough for me to wrap around myself to cover up to leave the bathroom. I will definitely look into getting a robe or house coat as some people call it. My boyfriend and I were talking about it last night and he’s on my side 100% and thinks it’s weird my buddy waited until I was in the bathroom and about to start my shower. I also didn’t think of throwing my clean clothes on in the heat of the moment because of all of the chaos that was talking place (i.e the yelling screaming swearing and the banging on the door)(like I said I have sensory issues and everything going on was incredibly overwhelming and overstimulating so I know I wasn’t thinking 100% clearly because I was getting upset and having a difficult time regulating in that moment and was still upset after my shower, my SD came and laid in bed with me and was doing some DPT and helping me calm down I also didn’t leave my room for about 45 minutes after I got out of the shower and when I did my mom and buddy were still mad at me and making snide comments and even yelling at me for a minute and I only left my room to take my dog out so my bf and I could go to bed)and I was a little apt to leave the bathroom because at that moment it felt like the safest place to be because there was a barrier between me and the yelling. Also a bit more back ground on the whole situation that my bf pointed out I hadn’t even noticed but my mom tends to take my “brothers” side and tends to favor him over me and after he said that and me thinking on it I can see he might be onto something with that one. I also gave him and my bf a few minutes to speak up while I was grabbing clothes then told them again before I walked into the bathroom that I was going to take a quick shower.

I, female (16) am the middle child of my family, I have an older stepsister and an older brother. I watched my brother grow up as a teenager, he did typical teenage boy things. I always admired how he went to see his friends, went out with girls and got to drive wherever he wanted. While he did his teenage chaos I was at home. I was a kid, however, I was always helping my mom clean or cook. Even if it was against my will, which is pretty normal. All my life I was and still am a people pleaser for my parents. I always wanted their approval, so badly. And I’ve always kept good grades. The worst thing I’ve gotten was a C.

My stepsister, was a teen mom. My dad was devastated, and disappointed. So, I’ve never been alone with a boy. Anytime I was talking alone to a guy I was talked down to afterwards. My phone used to be checked for contacts to make sure I wasn’t talking to a boy. Obviously for sure no boyfriend. Just because my older sister got pregnant I have to be watched. I’m not allowed to go out with friends on my own, I can’t go to dances without supervision. You’d think I was some bad kid, all I do is stay home read and draw. 

I clean dishes and the kitchen. I don’t mind it, but I find it unfair that I wash the dishes and mop the floor and help cook. However my older brother can just sit at the table while my mom and me clean everything up. Sometimes I do it alone so my mom can go to bed. Sometimes she lets me go to my room and says she’ll finish it. I’ve grown up feeling like my dad or brother dish washer. I try to look at it from the over point of view. But even when I got a job, nothing changed. I was still washing their dishes and cleaning, even if I was tired. I understand times are different but I feel like I deserve some freedom.

It was a one time thing and we were all friends after that for years and it wasn’t something anyone really ever mentioned again and we’ve been best friends now for about 15 years. 

My brother was getting married and I was struggling a lot with my mental health and having some pretty severe panic attacks. I was handling all of the floral arrangements for the wedding (which I offered to do) and was having a hard time so I asked my brother if I could bring my best friend to help me. He was worried because his fiancé is a very jealous type but he ended up saying it was fine as long as I didn’t involve her too much and certainly never bring up the incident when we were younger.

Everything worked out great, wedding was perfect, flowers looked amazing and everyone was happy.

About a year after the wedding, a friend of my brothers was telling a story about how my brother was popular with the ladies in high school and.. spilled the beans.

She absolutely lost it and had a complete meltdown and was extremely hurt by me and my brother for bringing this friend to the wedding. I apologized and admitted it was selfish and wrong and that I understand her being hurt. 

For the past three years it’s gone from bad to worse. If I try to visit them and the kids she cries and gets extremely upset with my brother. She has said that she finds it disrespectful that he still talks to me and that he isn’t angry with me. She said that i don’t support woman, she does not trust me, and that she would prefer it that I am not in their lives. I’m not supposed to mention my best friends name when I’m with them, but since she is my best friend I have slipped up and my sister in law will cry and leave the room.

When he told us over dinner he said that it would be great because it meant I could give him a ride to work every day, meaning he can save the money that would've been spent on a car/transport for a deposit for his own apartment.

I told him that he's a grown ass adult and he can make his own way to and from work. He'll need to take two buses, but it's feasible. I also made the argument that it would not look professional to have a supervisor and a new employee turn up to and leave work together every day.

I'm not mad at him at all - it's actually one of the better entry level jobs available in my city. It would not be an inconvenience at all because our schedules would be the same. I'm not embarrassed of him at all - I just think he needs to figure shit out on his own.

Two buses because that's the quickest way for him to get there - a local bus from a stop around the corner from our place to the town center, then another bus that takes him practically to the front door of the business. And there is a good chance that at some stage I will be required to supervise/manage him, so I think it's important to establish professional boundaries early on.

119,1ffibp3,"AITA for refusing to visit/speak to my MIL after she told my partner to "" marry someone else "" ? ","Me(23f) and my partner Al(25m) have been together for 7 years. We have two beautiful young children. 

A little bit of context: Two weeks prior to visiting I had just found out Al was cheating on me for the entirety of our relationship so I was feeling rather sensitive this day.
Anyway, we were visiting my MIL a few months ago, while we were there we started talking about Al's immigration status and when we would be getting married so he can get his citizenship. I told my MIL I wouldn't get married just for some papers. I told her if I was to get married it would be because we love eachother and would want to spend the rest of our lives together (I was holding back tears as I said this).
Also me and Al have never discussed getting engaged let alone get married. It's something that would always get brushed off to which he would say "" wait until we're older "".

That being said she completely lost her mind she yelled out to Al ""then marry someone else"" followed by a ton of rude remarks to me like ""you've never had a job who's going to take care of you"" ""you don't know how to do anything"" she kept arguing to me but I didn't say anything since I'm not the type to be confrontational and was just taken aback by her reaction and comments.
After a few minutes Al steps in and tells her to calm down and to stop attacking me. She stops and goes upstairs leaving me, Al and FIL alone. FIL apologizes by saying ""that's how your mom is do whatever you guys want"" we left after that and I haven't been back since.

Now, Al is starting to tell me we're going to have to go visit them again soon and he wants me to go too. I told him I wouldn't because I wouldn't feel welcomed or comfortable being at her house after last time. This has now turned into an arguement between me and Al. He says I need to go or else me and him are going to be on bad terms.( As if we're doing so good right now)
He brushes it off by saying that's how his mom is and I need to deal with it. I told him I wouldn't be going back unless she apologized to me. He laughs and says she's not going to apologize. So that leaves us to where we are now.

I'm not quite sure when he's planning on going back but MIL's birthday is coming up soon so I think that's when. Maybe I'm being petty but I also think I have the right to feel this way after such an irrational reaction.
I have to get some other opinions before then so AITA? ",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-13,"AITA for refusing to visit/speak to my MIL after she told my partner to "" marry someone else "" ?  Me(23f) and my partner Al(25m) have been together for 7 years. We have two beautiful young children. 

A little bit of context: Two weeks prior to visiting I had just found out Al was cheating on me for the entirety of our relationship so I was feeling rather sensitive this day.
Anyway, we were visiting my MIL a few months ago, while we were there we started talking about Al's immigration status and when we would be getting married so he can get his citizenship. I told my MIL I wouldn't get married just for some papers. I told her if I was to get married it would be because we love eachother and would want to spend the rest of our lives together (I was holding back tears as I said this).
Also me and Al have never discussed getting engaged let alone get married. It's something that would always get brushed off to which he would say "" wait until we're older "".

That being said she completely lost her mind she yelled out to Al ""then marry someone else"" followed by a ton of rude remarks to me like ""you've never had a job who's going to take care of you"" ""you don't know how to do anything"" she kept arguing to me but I didn't say anything since I'm not the type to be confrontational and was just taken aback by her reaction and comments.
After a few minutes Al steps in and tells her to calm down and to stop attacking me. She stops and goes upstairs leaving me, Al and FIL alone. FIL apologizes by saying ""that's how your mom is do whatever you guys want"" we left after that and I haven't been back since.

120,1fg9926,AITA for taking a baby away from my partner when she smokes weed around him,"My partner watches an 11 month old from time to time. Today I went out on the balcony (which is pretty small) with the two of them and she proceeds to spark up a blunt and starts smoking with him about two feet away from him. I picked him up and took him inside. I said secondhand smoke isn’t good for him. She’s pretty upset and offended. I think she feels like I’m being disrespectful and rude about her habits because she’s absolutely livid I did that. 
Am I overreacting that a baby shouldn’t be around any type of smoke even if it’s marijuana? Am I the asshole?

Edit: thank you guys for reassuring me. After the argument I felt as though I was being disrespectful to the lifestyle of stoners or ignorant to the possibility that there’s actual evidence weed smoke doesn’t harm the lungs in comparison to cigarette smoke. She said it doesn’t matter because we were technically outside but I know it still matters in such close proximity. I will be having a conversation with the mother.

We sat on a bench in the local park and she told me she was feeling down with how I had little to no time for our relationship (we both have a 1 month long contract but on mine I work all day and I use my free time to rest). I told her several times that when I'm really tired all I want is my own space, something she said she understood.

122,1fg97ha,AITA for not reminding my brother the specific day I was coming home?,"My brother Sam (28M) and I (33F) rent the family home from my dad. My brother has the downstairs, I the upstairs and we share the main floor. My brother keeps his area a mess---think beer bottles and takeout containers strewn over the floor and heaped in piles. 

 

On the top floor where I live, I vacuum and take out the trash regularly. 

 

In the kitchen, I stock up on food for myself, with a third of my food going missing. I keep toilet paper in the kitchen’s bathroom. Often that disappears too. 

 

Whenever I traveled, I would come home to find the main level a disaster. So I started warning Sam forty-eight hours before I returned that I needed the house to be some semblance of clean. 

 

This summer I traveled internationally. While there I got very sick. I suddenly needed to navigate a healthcare system where I did not speak the language. For two weeks I could only lay in bed and cry in pain and could not walk. The doctors stressed as I started to get better: I needed to rest.

 

I came home to Sam rushing upstairs with a bat. He thought I was a home invader. I was so busy being sick I remembered I had only told the family thread two weeks before an estimated date of my arrival. I had not remembered to tell Sam two days before that I needed him to clean. 

 

I was too exhausted to deal with the state of the house so I went upstairs. There was someone’s belongings strewn across my office’s floor, along with bags of old Taco Bell wrappers. My sink was caked in toothpaste and beard trimmings. A clog in the toilet made the whole upstairs smell like a porta potty.

 

Sam admitted that he had invited his friend Daniel to live in my office for a few weeks; Daniel’s lease was up and he had a new job in another city starting in a month. Sam swore that if I had only told him exactly when I was coming home, he would have cleaned up and told me that his friend was living here. 

 

Sam saw nothing wrong with the fact that he had not asked me about his friend moving in before he moved in. He saw nothing wrong with the fact that he also not offered his friend the spare bed in his area. No, he gave his friend my cleaner space, where I have possessions I care about. Sam said he wanted to be a “hero” and help, and I should be more empathetic to someone down on their luck. I see him as a hero who says he will slay a dragon, only to throw someone else in the lair. 

 

My father was mad at my brother for not telling him he was having a long-term guest, but then the discussion shifted to my lack of communication. My father said I should have warned Sam I was coming back, as Sam has ADHD and is not good at dates. He even asked me if, since it would only be a few weeks, maybe Daniel could sleep in my office? I said absolutely not. Everyone wants to be kind to others with me bearing the consequences. 

 

I am terrified for the end of the month, when Daniel’s job mysteriously disappears and he needs to stay for “just” another month.

123,1fg94qr,AITA for trying to force my husband to work?,Hi this is my first ever post so I hope I am doing it correctly. I 33F recently got my hours cut from full time to part time which was a huge hit as I was bringing in most of the money. I have been feeling incredibly upset and overwhelmed since then. My husband almost 37M only works part time anywhere from 15-20 hours a week. He also started a business last year for something he does not have a ton of experience in and that is not going well at all. I wanted to be supportive and kind but now that I've lost my job basically I really really need him to step up and get a full time job. Am I being unreasonable? I have put in over 50 applications trying as hard as I can to find something else something full time but I've had no luck so far. I just need to know if I should keep pushing him or just try harder myself. When I do bring it up to him he will say things like fine I'll get a job just know that I will be completely miserable and you will have to deal with it. I feel like he is gaslighting me. We both didn't have the best upbringings though mine was alot worse than his so stability is so important to me. I just want better for my kids.
