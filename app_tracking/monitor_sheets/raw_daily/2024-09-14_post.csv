0,1fgol2e,AITA for choosing a very bad time to come out?,"I (17MTF) have questioned for a year or so but recently realized & solidified that I am trans. I have a friend who I'll call Nadia who is also MTF. 

  
It took Nadia three years to come out. She told us in our group discord server around two months ago. 

A month or so later, I replied to her message and talked about my discomfort with being a man. A different friend of mine who I'll call Patrick replied to my message quickly and we talked in the server for a while over it, eventually culminating in me officially coming out as trans and announcing that tomorrow I was going to come out to my parents, which I did.

The issue is that my process of talking it over in the server was a lot less concise and less certain than Nadia's, and I could tell she thought I'd decided in a day to ""become"" trans with no forethought. It probably seemed dramatic to her. 

Anyway I'm not sure if this has to do with it, or the fact that we weren't super close to begin with, but Nadia has stopped really talking to me (we hadn't talked much before either) and we grew apart. I stopped talking with that group about being trans, because I didn't want to steamroll over her. 

I feel real bad I chose that time, and that I couldn't keep quiet about it until a more appropriate time, or at least be more certain and not make it seem like it was a fatuous, sudden ""decision"" of mine like I didn't know how gender works.

2,1fgy4e8,AITA for the yelling at my sister for trying to set me up?,"AITA,
I (15F) have a twin sister. She's always been better at relationships than I have. She's been in 2 relationships and now her current one. She's been dating her girlfriend for nearly four months now (and being two lesbians have of course already said I love you) They are cute together though.

I have never been in a relationship and even though a lot of my friends are single I often get referred to as the single one or the third wheel because of I've expressed how much I want a relationship. (Probably because of my lack of self worth). 

I have a non-binary friend (Let's call them Sam) Me and Sam have been friends for 3 years now and we talk a lot. Recently they texted me and asked me out on a date. I said no and I felt really bad about it. I've only ever rejected one other person (also a friend) and I expressed that I don't want to date my friends. It just makes things really awkward. I told Sam that I was flattered but would just like to stay friends and they were really understanding. 

However right after i sent the text, my sister came in and asked ""well?"" And I said what do you mean? Turns out Sam, my sister and her girlfriend had discussed about how they were gonna ask me out. They even created a group chat specifically for discussing it. This I already thought was an invasion of my personal life and felt weird that they were discussing about me and for how long? Because I found out that Sam had liked me for months now. I told my sister that I said no because I didn't feel attracted to them in that way. (Note: their gender identity didn't affect my decision, I'm bisexual) My sister got upset and said that I should just try dating them anyway because I want a relationship.

I got mad and said I'm not going to date someone I'm not attracted too just because I want to date someone because that's not fair to them. And that I don't appreciate her trying to make me do so. And that creating a group chat to discuss me was really weird.

She got mad and said that if I want a relationship I should stop rejecting people. I don't think that's right but I am starting to feel bad for getting mad at her.

4,1fgxky1,WIBTA if I refuse to cooperate with money for my mothers eye cataract surgery? ,"
My (f34) mother (f66) was diagnosed with bilateral cataract four years ago and the ophthalmologist (who is my husband) said she needed surgery. She is going through a hard time when it comes to her health: She’s had knee and wrist surgery in the last couple of years. She still experiences trouble walking, gained a lot of weight, is diabetic, and depressed. She doesn’t have health insurance. 

I love my mom very much but she is a very hard person to offer help to: She Refuses to seek medical attention. I found an insurance that apparently covers elderly people (no insurance wants to cover her because of her age and diseases) but she still thought it was way too expensive and said no. She claims that all of this refusal to take care of herself is because she doesn’t have money. I suggested  to enroll  her in a government paid health program but she refused because she didn’t want to physically go to a public hospital. She owns two houses and I have told her many times to sell or at least rent one of them but she doesn’t want to. I suggested she started selling catalog products so that she could get some extra money but she is bad at it and most of the products she buys never get sold and instead of helping her this idea backfired.

I have two younger sisters (f33,f 30) and we all worry a lot about our mom but ultimately decided that you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. Also she never asks for our help. She says she doesn’t want us to worry about her and that we have our own issues to deal with. 
 
The other day my aunt (my moms sister f,58) called me and told me she was worried about my mom because she was having troubles seeing in the dark and that she wanted to pay for the cataract surgery. (This aunt paid for my moms wrist surgery). I felt touched and a little guilty about this so at first I said nothing. She insisted and told me to tell her how much would it cost for my husband to operate on my mother and that she would pay for that. Ultimately I said “thank you” and went to ask my husband. He said he would not charge her but the hospital bills would approximately be 4k dollars. 

A day passed and I texted my aunt with the answer. I honestly don’t know who she talked with but she answered: “How come neither you or your sisters have talked about cooperating to help your mother ?” 
I felt this was very accusatory on her part but only answered: “The truth is none of us have the money”. 
And it is true: Both of my sisters are really struggling with their own debts and even though I am “ok” I have been saving money because I want to start fertility treatments. I haven’t saved much yet.  My aunt answered with “We’ll talk about this later”. 

I don’t want to talk about this later I already know she is going to guilt me into paying for this surgery by saying something about family and that this is MY mother we are talking about.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"WIBTA if I refuse to cooperate with money for my mothers eye cataract surgery?

5,1fgx5qd,AITA for telling my friend that she is technology addicted?,"I (13f) have been friends with Molly (13f) since 4th grade. We have been through a LOT together, with her losing her father in sixth grade. (They already had a difficult relationship) I tried to be as supportive as I could, and hopefully was supportive enough. We recently started 8th grade (I know I'm young, don't judge) I don't have her in any of my classes, though she does have a girl named Liv in all of hers. They have become really close recently, which I wouldn't care about, though I think that now it's getting a bit out of hand. During lunch (literally the only 30 minutes of the day I get to talk to her) she is constantly texting Liv, snapping Liv, and overall ignoring me. I have a small friend group, only 4 people, and the other two also just scroll on Pinterest. This leads to me being the one to make small talk, and when I try to make conversation they literally have 1 word answers. Yesterday I was just fed up of it. I said, ""Can we all stop being such phone addicted kids and start communicating as normal human beings?"" Molly said ""Ok, what do you want to talk about?"" And I said ""I don't know, why don't you guys come up with something for once?"" I know that was a very harsh way to say it, but in the moment I was really mad. I didn't think much of it, but I guess it really bothered Molly because she texted me later asking if I was ok and wht I was so mad earlier. The rest of the conversation is below: (every name is fake)
 Molly: I am not arguing with you. I am just tryin to see why you yelled at us.

Me: I feel like we haven't been talking that much at lunch lately, Karli and Sara are always on Pinterest and you are always on your phone too (as am i) The table is almost dead silent and I just didn't want to sit at a table where nobody's talking. I feel like lately I've been the one to start all the conversations, but I really didn't mean to yell. I don't know if it came across that way, I don't remember it well. I was kind of just trying to focus on my math, and the words just kind of came out. Lunch is really the only time where I get to talk to you, and I can't even do that because you are on your phones too much. Sorry if this is mean I've just been thinking about it a bit.

Molly: Look I agree that we are on our phones. But it's also my time to decompress, so don’t get mad at me for decompressing.

Me: Oh ok I do get that, I just feel like you wanna hang out more with Liv than me.

Molly: Yes I am spending more time with Liv. That doesn’t mean I don’t want to spend time with you. Nobody is being excluded.

Me: I guess, but even at lunch, you're snapping Liv, talking about Liv a lot, and just seem to have so much more fun with her I am just jealous, which sounds stupid

Molly:Kara I am friends with you and Liv. And my friendship with Liv is new and I like hanging out with Liv and you. I don’t want to argue.

6,1fgwrqj,AITA for yelling at my friends for not respecting privacy,"We hosted an grill and sauna evening at our place. For some context we have two kids the older one almost 4 years old so life can be quite hectic. We got a babysitter for the kids and decided to invite four friends over to grill and later go and relax in the sauna. So my partner and I cleaned the entire downstairs so living room/dining room, bathroom/toilet and kitchen. Upstairs was off limits since there is our bedrooms and a single toilet. 

  
Everything was going fine. My partner left to run her errands and I stayed home with our friends and hang out. At some point two of my friends just vanished and I went looking for them. I checked the downstairs and even upstairs even tough it was off limits. Didnt find them so figured they went to the parking lot to check their cars or whatnot. Well I get a call from my SO and she is asking why the hell are our friends in our bedroom!? At the same time I see them coming downstairs. I dont even have time to answer my SO before I exploded and asked quite loudly why were they upstairs. They didnt have a reason and were obviously kind of startled/shocked at my reaction but understood they shouldnt have gone in there. 

  
The atmosphere was kind of tense for 30-60 mins. I went to cool off and they went to the back porch to continue the grilling. One of my friends comes to chat with me and points out I seem kind of peeved and I admit that I was mad that the two friends didnt respect our boundaries. Anyway after I breathed for a bit I joined them again and we continued our evening normally. No tension anymore and everyone seemed to have a fun time in the end. 

  
They thanked me for the evening and left. I was expecting an apology but didnt get it. Its not the biggest deal but I thought it would be common courtesy to apologize for a mistake they did. So Am I the asshole?

7,1fgwoqc,AITA for not attending friend’s bday party?,"Hello,

My old friend/roommate from college invited me to her birthday party.  I haven’t seen her in about 4-5 years (bc life!) We’ve kept in contact and probably chat once or twice a year to check in. 

I RSVP’d yes a week ago, however I didn’t realize the bar she’s hosting it at is quite a ways from where I live. I don’t own a car or have a ride, so I would have to Uber. One-way would cost me $30 not to mention on the way back home it will be even more expensive due to it being a Saturday night. So, in total I would spend about close to $60/$70 getting to the party. 

I don’t have the money to spend this much on an Uber plus a gift. I was thinking of just sending her money (maybe $30) through Zelle as a gift and telling her I can’t make it. I feel bad because it’s so last minute (literally a hour before the party), but I can’t afford it! AITA?

8,1fgwmqh,AITA For refusing to invite my cousin to any more of my hang-outs and telling my aunt and uncle that Claire making no effort is probably the real reason why she isn’t making any friends?,"My aunt and uncle are down on their luck, they moved in with my grandparents, and now my cousin Claire (15 y.o.) is going to the same school is me (16 y.o.)



Claire does have some minor issues that could discourage potential friends, but they really don’t matter compared to the fact that she doesn’t talk to anyone. Claire immediately ends any conversation that other people try to have with her, and she’s been like that for years



After moving, my aunt and uncle told me that Claire is scared that she’s going to be bullied again like she was at her last school, and asked me to invite Claire to hang out with me and my friends. I did, and it went nowhere.



Me and my friends tried to start conversations with Claire about herself. But she’d always just be like “sure” or “I don’t know.” She didn’t ask anyone else about themselves. She went on her phone and basically made no real effort back.



I told my family about it, and my aunt and uncle asked me to give Claire another chance. Same story. Claire hung out with my friend group multiple times and she hasn’t shown any indication that she even wants to be there.



School just started, and Claire is not being any different. According to a friend, Claire actually refused to participate in the class icebreaker and got called to the teacher’s desk after class (He had to get to his other class and didn’t see/hear anything after that.)



My aunt and uncle came to me again and told me that Claire is upset because she can’t seem to make friends, and they asked if she could hang out with me and my friends again. This time, I told them no. We don’t click in the first place, and honestly have no common interests. She can join a club or talk to people by herself. Think of what they would recommend if I wasn’t at the same school and tell her to do that.



(This is where I was probably the asshole)



I kept talking and said I get she’s having a hard time and maybe won’t let anyone in for fear of being bullied. But nobody wants to chase a person who gives no effort back into a conversation. And her acting this way is probably the real reason why she isn’t making any friends



My aunt and uncle went off at me, and they and my parents got into an argument over it. My aunt and uncle told me you’re not gonna have any contact with most of the people you hung out with in high school but Claire will always be my cousin and I need to “get over” myself and help her. I’m expecting too much and that if I were bullied at my old school, I wouldn’t suddenly feel safe at the new one, and to have some patience and empathy.



I felt I’ve already done enough in the patience and empathy department. Claire made no effort back and clearly no one can make friends for her. I see the last bit of what I said as a reality check, but my aunt and uncle have basically called it bullying and my parents didn’t really take a stance on it. AITA?

School just started, and Claire is not being any different. According to a friend, Claire actually refused to participate in the class icebreaker and got called to the teacher’s desk after class (He had to get to his other class and didn’t see/hear anything after that.)



My aunt and uncle came to me again and told me that Claire is upset because she can’t seem to make friends, and they asked if she could hang out with me and my friends again. This time, I told them no. We don’t click in the first place, and honestly have no common interests. She can join a club or talk to people by herself. Think of what they would recommend if I wasn’t at the same school and tell her to do that.



(This is where I was probably the asshole)



I kept talking and said I get she’s having a hard time and maybe won’t let anyone in for fear of being bullied. But nobody wants to chase a person who gives no effort back into a conversation. And her acting this way is probably the real reason why she isn’t making any friends



My aunt and uncle went off at me, and they and my parents got into an argument over it. My aunt and uncle told me you’re not gonna have any contact with most of the people you hung out with in high school but Claire will always be my cousin and I need to “get over” myself and help her. I’m expecting too much and that if I were bullied at my old school, I wouldn’t suddenly feel safe at the new one, and to have some patience and empathy.



I felt I’ve already done enough in the patience and empathy department. Claire made no effort back and clearly no one can make friends for her. I see the last bit of what I said as a reality check, but my aunt and uncle have basically called it bullying and my parents didn’t really take a stance on it. AITA?

9,1fgwjja,AITA for telling my mom she shouldn’t let a man live with us,"I don't want to give too much information away so I'll try to tell this story in a way that just gets the point across.

So I (18F) am in my first year of college. And as it's important to the story, l'm a commuter. This usually means that I'm home pretty much during the day, with the exception of my morning classes and my evening classes on Monday's and Wednesday's. With that said, almost two weeks ago, my mom told me that she would be talking to a friend of hers about letting someone from our home country (my family is from a west African country) stay with them, because the person in question has won a lottery ticket allowing them to come here to America.

The problem that arose was that the people he had arranged a living situation with backed out last minute when it became apparent he would actually be coming here. So my mom talked to some friends and no one really got back to her about letting him stay with them.
She then decided that she would have this man stay with us.

Now, although I understand that being able to come to America is not an opportunity he would want to pass up, I think that the idea that my mom is okay with letting a person she doesn't personally know stay in a home alone with her daughter is concerning. My mom works a job that requires her to live away from home, so it's really just me and my younger sister here, even then since my sister is really envolved in school, 5 days of the week she's at school from 7am to 6pm, that leaves me alone with a complete stranger, and I would hope other people would be able to see the problem with that. 

I told her how I felt about this, and she then began to downplay the situation. Stating that he went to college, as if going to college would somehow make this any less of an issue. And I then told her that this just highlights how little she seems to care about me as compared to my little sister. Because I know if I were dorming this year, the thought of letting him stay would never even cross her mind. But because it’s me he would mostly be around, she’s somehow fine with it.

Her inability to acknowledge how concerning the situation is however, makes me wonder if maybe I'm being selfish for not wanting him to live with us, but being someone who has been raised solely by a woman, l've never really lived with men, and as she was always working, I've grown to accept being independent and living alone. The thought of living alone with a complete stranger is so uncomfortable for me. 

If it were a cousin, I think I would be able to rationalize the situation, but the fact that it's someone she doesn't even know herself, it just makes the situation all the worse to me. I do acknowledge that I may overreacting because he is a man, but as a person who has unfortunately had many ill-encounters with men because of situations like this one, I feel that it's necessary to be cautious of this one.

**Background on mom, my brother and his girlfriend:**

Long story short: My girlfriend (now wife) and I had terrible months living in the same house with my brother + his girlfriend, which ended in us moving out after my brother was incited by her to break into our apartment and my mom being permanently hospitalised until her untimely passing.

There's a lot that happened, but I only have so many characters so I have to skip most of the fluff. You have to trust me when I say it was a nightmare.



**Relationship between my father + me:**

He's been a distant figure since the divorce of my parents when I was 6. My father has been open about me not being his favorite child:

* I was born male, he wished for a girl. He kept a strand of hair when I was an infant. It felt and looked like a girls to him.
* I had health issues early in my life. He feared to be financially liable for a cripple.
* He felt the children he set into this world are ""taking his life away""
* He told my mother to not let me attend an university, because it's expensive.
* He *literally never calls and never visits*. 
* I have no skills that are of praticular use to him.

My fathers view on a father-son relationship differ from mine. He said to me if I'm interested in my creator it's my duty to call and check up on him, not his to call me.



**Planning of the wedding:**

*We did consider inviting my father and his wife,* but decided against it for three reasons:

1. It's a given that if we invited my father, my brother as well as his girlfriend would've known about the wedding in the shortest time. We feared she would do her worst and not leave us alone. 
2. My father and especially his wife have accused me of only being interested in their money.
3. We were not invited to his wedding and were only informed years after the fact.

So in the end it was a question if I could rather live with the potential terror my brother and his gf could cause, as well as the accusation of only inviting for monetary gifts

We were short on people to join which is why R invited Nia to also try out the job. The problem is she has super bad stage fright and wanted to occupy an offstage role controlling some of the stage tech instead and reading her lines with a microphone, which isn't too unprecedented for shows nowadays tbf, and little kids especially wouldn't care

My (f30) parents (f56 & m73) have let me live in their home while I figure out some health concerns (extreme gastric issues that have been life-long, but have recently escalated to levels that incapacitate me). I recently decided with my dad, that I would sell him my truck; because I'm unable to consistently drive it. We agreed on $1000 and he told me outright that he would need to pay me in monthly installments of $100, and I agreed. So far, he has paid me $300.

18,1fgu776,AITA? Allison's passing: A Catalyst for Friendship Friction,"I have a small group of friends that I've known since middle school. We're now all in our 30s. There's me, Carla, Mary, Allison, and Keri. We recently found out a couple of weeks ago that Allison died from an overdose. Since finding out, we've all created a group chat to comfort each other and plan to get together to remember our friend. We all live in different parts of town, and all of our schedules are a bit all over the place. The original plan was to have a sleepover at Keri's house and go visit Allison's Mom the next day. Mary had sent a text to Allison's Mom to see if she would be up to seeing everyone. We wanted to wait for the mom's reply before we set up a date, especially because Carla would have to request the day off in advance, or plan in advance to leave early because she is the manager of a gym. The only problem is that Allison's birthday was coming up on Sept. 12, and we wanted to do this on the 11th to remember her and honor her heavenly birthday. Since we haven't heard from the mom yet, and Allison's bday was creeping up, Mary suggests we at least go out and have a couple beers in her honor. I agree to do so, and suggest we go to a brewery close to my house. Mary agrees, Keri says she won't be able to because she has her kids and they have school the next day, and Carla is hesitant but agreed to go if she could ride with Mary, since she has car troubles. Carla also said she would have to leave work a couple of hours earlier in order to go. So, it was settled, more or less. I received a text on the 10th from Carla saying that she left work early because she had food poisoning, and because of that, she won't be able to leave early on the 11th to have some beer. I told her I hope she feels better and I'm sorry she got sick. Then I sent a text to her on the 11th to confirm that she's for sure not able to go, and she said no, she's not. Then she asks if Mary is still going, and I said yes. Carla then proceeds to text how upset she is that we're not doing the original sleepover plan, says Mary never agreed to ride together or responded to her (which she did), she's upset that we're going to my side of town, and she claims that she can't just leave work early or call off because she's the ""only manager"". I replied to her and said I understand why she's upset, but the original plan will still happen, it's just pushed back. She never wrote back after that. The following morning, (the 12th), Carla texts me that her boyfriend doesn't have to work, and that she decided to call out of work to enjoy her day with him on the river. At first, I was happy for her because she doesn't get much time off, but then as the day went on I was like.... wtf?? So I sent her a text on the 13th, and basically told her I needed to be honest about how I feel and expressed my confusion to her being upset about not being able to request a day off in advance, but in the same week, she leaves early and then calls out? She hasn't responded at all, and I anticipate not hearing from her for a while. Am I the asshole?? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITA?

19,1fgu5rf,AITA for uninviting my best friend to my birthday party because I don’t like her boyfriend?,"My best friend (26f) and I (24f) have been friends since my freshman year of high school. She’s the funniest person I know and a very kind, supportive friend. However, one of her biggest flaws is her constant need for male validation. She has always been really “boy crazy.” She is always telling me about whatever new guy she’s talking to, and there’s a high turnaround. This isn’t inherently bad. I respect whatever she wants to do with other consenting adults in her free time, and she should be able to talk about her experiences to her friends. However, it’s literally constant and sometimes when we hang out it will be all she wants to talk about the whole time. 

She started dating someone (27m) a couple months ago. He’s all she talks about. At first he seemed like he treated her ok and she’s happy (so she says) so I had no qualms about this relationship.

One day she called me crying and said she found his ex’s nudes on his phone. Apparently he had purchased her OnlyFans. He defended this by saying he has a porn addiction. Of course I thought this was disgusting and encouraged her to break up with this awful person. But she didn’t do that. With peace and love, she has no backbone, so she accepted his apology and they tried to move on. She knows I hate him and so do the rest of our friends, but she still talks about him incessantly as if nothing happened. 

Another day I woke up to a bunch of notifications of him liking my posts on instagram at like 2 am. Weird. I told my friend and she dismissed my concerns and told me I should be friends with him. 

Another time he sent me pictures of racy clothing and lingerie and asked me what I thought my best friend might like. It made me feel so gross, but again, my friend didn’t think it was an issue.

My birthday is very close to my best friend’s birthday so for many years in a row we’ve had a joint celebration. She of course wants her boyfriend to be there so I told her she should have her own celebration this year and I’ll have mine. 

She was extremely hurt by this and hasn’t talked to me since then. Now I feel bad. Maybe we can find a compromise? I don’t know what to do at this point.

I (19nb) was dating Michael (22nb) (fake name) for around a year or so. We met each other at a local gathering and got along very well for a month or so, before he suddenly asked me out over the phone. I said yes, and we began dating. 

I told him right from the very beginning that my parents were somewhat homophobic and transphobic, and that I just didn’t know the full extent as they knew I was nonbinary, but they never used my preferred name or my pronouns. Michael accepted this, and said that I didn’t have to tell them that we were dating until I was comfortable, but that he would like it to happen “soon”, as he didn’t want “crazy in-laws” when we married, and he didn’t want to feel like a secret. 

I told him that I understood, but I would like to at least move out before I come out about this, as it was incredibly personal and they were already really controlling over my life (they didn’t like any ideas of me having a partner, cis or trans). He said it had to happen before I moved out, because he didn’t want my parents to feel like he was “stealing” me. We compromised, and the conversation wasn’t brought up again for a few months.

Around 6 months into the relationship, he started bugging me about coming out to my parents, saying that he felt like he was being hidden away from the world (even though literally all of my friends knew about him), and that it needed to happen soon or we would break up. I said I wasn’t comfortable, and that I still don't know the full extent of my parents' homophobia and that I didn’t want to risk anything bad happening. I told Michael that I may be an adult but I still rely on my parents financially since I haven’t been able to find a job, and that I need their support. He said that I thought too much about what they think of me, and left it at that.

He left it alone for another few months until our year anniversary hit, and two weeks after he broke up with me. He said that it wasn’t me, that it was him, but about three weeks after the breakup I found out it was because I wasn’t telling my parents about him.

I said that I didn't want to be friends with her again and apologised that he was being used as a messenger, he said it was fine, I told him to get her to talk to me herself (I don't have her blocked on anything and she has no need to hide behind a mutual friend)

I don't really think I'm in the wrong for not wanting to forgive her but I am kind of worried that I'm holding onto old grudges since I'm sure she's changed since first year I just don't feel like I'm over it yet.",0.0,-0.009648936800658703,0,1

1) Adjusting the air con temperature lower when he said it was too cold.
2) Using too many emoji in my text messages
3) Not replying fast enough
4) Have ""integrity"" issues because I was not honest about the places I have been to (why do I need to tell him everything?)
5) Buying concert tickets but didn't include him in.

So obviously I was very blindsided by it and very heartbroken. I still loved him for months after our breakup - and to cope with that, I begin writing poems on him and I would post it my Instagram. No names were mentioned but the poems was obviously about him. The themes are mainly on how cold I felt, how he betrayed me, etc etc.

He called me (lol) and told me the poems humiliated him. He was also upset that I didn't see how my toxicity caused the breakup and now I am continuing to be toxic to him after the breakup.

29,1fgsngl,WIBTA Asking For My $10 Back?,"Hi guys! Really quick situation that I'm just kind of struggling with.

  
My friend and I went out to a bar 6 months back. I had a drink and some fries that she was grazing on (that I was happy to share) and eventually she decided that she wanted to just get her own side of fries instead because she was hungrier than she thought. She asked if we could put it on my tab and that she would pay me back. So I did it with no problem. She wasn't the only friend on my tab, so at the end of the night I went through the bill and placed everyone's Venmo requests per usual. 

A month went by and she didn't pay the Venmo request (no biggie, it's only $10) so I send a reminder through the app to pay it (other people on the tab also needed reminders). 5 months went by and she never paid it-- it just sat there. Today she declined it. So WIBTA if I texted her and asked her why she declined the Venmo request? To essentially press her to pay me back? It is only $10 and my friendship with her is more important. I feel petty.

For further context, I am a grad student really struggling to scrape together all the money I have and she's from a very wealthy family, so money is absolutely not a problem here. I feel bad pestering her over $10, but to me that's still a really good chunk of money.

30,1fgsm7d,AITA for erasing someone’s artwork?,"This just recently happened, and I feel bad about it, but at the same time, I feel like I was justified.

I work at a local coffee shop that opened about 7 months ago, and I’ve been here for 3 months now. One of the baristas, who’s been with the shop since it opened and is a really good artist, left for school last month (but will likely come back during breaks). She used to do cute chalkboard art for our menu items. When the shop first opened, they didn’t have many drinks besides the basics—lattes, coffees, americanos, etc. So, any specialty drinks would go on a little chalkboard, and she’d make artwork for them.

Now, 7 months in, we have a big selection of specialty drinks that have become staples. My boss updated our menus to include them officially. The baristas are always experimenting with new latte flavors, so anytime a new drink was created (usually by her), she would erase an old chalkboard drawing (since it’s now on the menu) and make a new one for the latest creation. Customers could try it, and if it became popular, it’d get added to the official menu. Since she left, no one’s updated the chalkboards because none of us are good at drawing.

One of our dessert items is a strawberry shortcake cup, and she made a sign for it, even drawing the cartoon character. It was really cute, and you could tell she put a lot of time and effort into it. However, we rarely make it anymore—the last time was about 3 weeks ago, and they usually sell out within a day or two. So, I erased it.

We have a lot of drinks that aren’t on the menu yet, including fall and winter flavors the baristas want to try. The owner has said he didn’t want to buy more chalkboards, so I took the liberty of erasing the ones we didn’t need anymore. The strawberry shortcake one was the only one I erased—I left four others up even though those are also now on the official menu.

When the owner found out, he made me feel bad about erasing all her hard work and said it was disrespectful not to ask her first. In hindsight, maybe I should’ve texted her to ask, but I also feel like I didn’t have to since we all work here and have equal rights to the chalkboards and use it to how we see fit. Plus, she doesn’t work here at the moment, and one of the new baristas said they’re a good artist and could make new artwork. Honestly, I’m not bad at drawing myself—it would just take me longer.

Idk how she feels about her artwork being erased, she might be fine with it for all we know, but I feel like she should expect the chalkboards to change eventually. After all, they’re meant for baristas to showcase new creations.

34,1fgsdnm,AITA for refusing to gift my balloon to my toddler sister ,"I (20 F) live with my mum (41 F) and my little sister (1,5 F). Originally I planned to move out 2 years ago, but since the baby's dad abandoned her she asked me to stay, keep her company while the kid is small. It was obvious she needed help, so I agreed to stay till my sister is two. 

It's obvious my mum favours my sister over me. Not in a ""she needs more attention"" way, but in a ""you were so much worse even as a baby"" way. She often talks about how bad I was as a child and how my sister is already so much smarter, easier than I was. How it was so tough to love me and I should be grateful she didn't start hating me after it. And my sister is perfectly easy to love and she's so proud of her. I even apologized for being a tough baby and toddler a few times. But it doesn't really make much of a difference. 

My whole family, including my grandparents and some close family friends, was having dinner for my twentieth birthday. The whole dinner everyone was yapping about my little sister. How cute she is, how smart for her age. Asking my mum about how my sister sleeps, eats and poops. Afterwards my grandparents gave me a gift with a ""happy birthday"" balloon tied to it. I loved it and actively expressed how I loved the balloon. 

Everybody who's close enough to me knows how much I love balloons. It makes me feel like a child and I simply think balloons are adorable. I used to get a balloon for my b-day since I can't remember myself and I felt deeply touched by this move, which I of course mentioned when thanked them for the gift.

My baby sister immediately started reaching for it, so to be a good sis I pulled it lower, showed it to her and let go back in the air. She kept fussing over the balloon, but as long as it was tied to my present and in my hands I didn't pay too much attention to this. Just a curious toddler.

As I came home I put the balloon in my room and tied it to my work chair. The next day when I came home from work I noticed the balloon was not there. I just assumed mum's cat could have popped it.
But anyway I asked my mum about what happened to the balloon. When I did, she casually said she tied it to my sister's bed since she ""liked it and needed it more because my birthday is over and I'm an adult"". 

I replied that I never agreed to gift her my birthday balloon and wanted it back. To what my mum answered that I'm being dramatic, balloons are for kids and she won't allow me to ""take away or steal"" this little happiness from a baby. And I basically should get over it. 

It's a small thing but it made me cry instantly and I just locked myself inside my room for a while. I was emotional over the fact that it was nothing for her and she genuinely thought it's okay to take away something I liked just because my sister liked it too. She totally knew balloons were emotionally valuable for me and still did not care. 

When I came out the room my mum angrily shoved the balloon inside and yelled how selfish I am. I feel like I am the biggest a-hole in the world. But I also feel unloved and betrayed.

37,1fgrzcq,"AITA for not giving my daughter any pocket money after being rude towards ""poor""classmate?","

Hello, i am 42 and I am making good money by owning some local stores, so i decided to give my child good pocket money(50 dollars per week). As onlychild she spends many time with her friends so i wanted her to have enough money for things like cinema. Me and my wife wanted another child but due to problems during giving pregnancy we couldnt.
 I thought that we make good job raising her. When she is around us she is angel and we hear from everyone how good raised she is. She is 15


Last tuesday i was sitting at terrace and enjoying my lunch when i saw her coming with some boy and girl from her class. I know that she is supposed to do some project to school with random clasmates picked by teacher so i wasnt surprised that i never saw them before. I get back to my lunch but then i heard my daugher telling to the girl to dont touch anything because she is too filthy. I sat here frozen and shocked. Boy said to my daughter to stop, grap the papers and go ( to the library), but she didnt stop and keeps doing coments about her beign too broke and make fun of her for already having job for broke people. 


I regret not doing anything by that time but i was just stunned. When i finally got myself to come down they are alredy on driveway leaving and to be honest i needed to calm down because i was angry, dissapointed and sad. My wife comes home and told her immedietely and she was same dissapointed as me. She starts to blame herself for not giving her correct values. 


We thought about it realising thats our Mistake and responsibility. We decided that she need some type of reality check for her own good. My wife is working in one of the shops i own ( she wants and she is very social so its like her dream job). We decided that she would stop getting pocket money and would starts working with my wife after School. 


When she cames home we gaved her talk about being rude and about not everybody being blessed with money.  We make sure She apologized to the girl from school.

She starts to come to the store  right after school. She is working only for three days and already being done and pleading us for everything going back to normal but we are convienced that this is what she needs.


Today my parents comes for lunch and when my daugher complained about working in store and not getting pocket money they starts to insult us for having money but being selfish and crual to our daughter. We explained what happened and that we wants to make sure she would realize that money arent growing on trees. They didnt take it well and said that she just said facts by insulting her classmate. We just sends them home and we decided to stop financially supporting them after being to ignorant and thinking that insulting someone bacause of money is just talking facts. 
I am 100% sure that what we are doing is right but still i would like to hear someone else opinion.

38,1fgrxhn,AITA for expecting more from my husband while he’s out of work?,"My husband and I (27M/26F) recently moved across the country for my dream job and he has been struggling to find a new full time job. This is completely fine and not something that I put pressure on him for. My career field is very niche and people are expected to move around for it if you’re serious about wanting a specific position/facility and I finally scored my big break. The most recent move was one that we had agreed would be our final “made it” stage of my career and overall was the best decision for us after being so far away from family for three years. 

Since our move was contingent on where I found a job I wanted, he wasn’t able to begin looking for a job in that area until I got hired which was about a month before we actually moved. Overall, it’s been about three months now that he’s been looking for work. In the meantime, he’s been working a very temporary part-time job to at least have income. I have already started working at my new spot full-time and have recently picked up an additional part time job on the side, not just to offset the lack of additional full-time income but also just moving into a high cost of living area. 

My problem is that I continuously have to leave him honey-do lists, ask him repeatedly to get basic tasks done around the house despite having had several conversations about him needing to take initiative to simply take care of the day to day home maintenance. The only reason I even have this expectation of him pulling the bulk of the home workload is that he is not currently working more than four hours a day, while I am working two jobs. 

Everytime I bring this issue up to him, which has been several times, he agrees with me and says he will pick up the slack. But what actually comes out of it is him doing a lot of chores on that one day and then slacking again. And when I ask “so how was your day” after work, I end up getting a response of “not as productive as I would’ve liked. I got caught in a tiktok hole/ I was sinking into a depressive episode/ I did the dishes and then got sucked into a video game” ect, ect. 

This constant back and forth is mentally exhausting and causing resentment toward him because I feel like I can not rely on him as a partner to carry the load, even when it comes to basic stuff. I also feel like I’m starting to lose respect/general attraction for him as the man in our relationship when it feels like I am needing to parent him into getting these basic things done when he is an adult, nearly 30, and shouldn’t have to be asked constantly to do little things. 

AITA for having this level of expectation from him during this time that he is in between work????

Edit: what I don’t think people are grasping from the original post is that I’m not upset or pressuring him about not having a full time job yet. As mentioned, the move was fully contingent on my employment and so I already had a jump on the job search before him and I don’t think it’s fair to put the pressure of “why don’t you have a job yet” on him when the timelines were very different. I agree with some suggestions that an aspect of his depressive feelings are stemming from him not having work yet and feeling like a failure from it and so I am being fully supportive of him needing time to accomplish that and not using it against him at all. 

Where I am taking issue is not his lack of employment currently, but how we are able to even out the household responsibilities since his days are not fully occupied by a job currently where as mine are.

39,1fgrx49,AITA for telling my mom she’s a bad mother?,"I (25f) have my own personal feelings around being an eldest sibling, and feeling parentified by my single mother (50f), but I always try to be sympathetic and extend my understanding. I can comprehend why she had to rely on me from a young age, and even though I feel all of my needs were neglected by her absence, it’s not like I want to cut her off. She’s my mom.

But honestly, this post doesn’t even really concern any of that. What really pisses me off is the way she treats my younger sister (22f).

My sister and I had traumatizing childhoods that included homelessness and being subjected to our parents’ addictions. We responded to it very differently. I was parentified so my needs were minimized and I tried to make myself as compliant as possible to appease my mom and earn her love which I felt like I never had. My sister however was very vocal about her disdain with our environment and the treatment she received from our mother. They were always fighting. 

Long story short, they are not close now that my sister and I are both adults. My mom has always treated me like a therapist and often victimizes herself to me to trigger my rescuer complex. She always laments to me about my sister and how she feels “manipulated” and like she’s being made to be the bad guy. I refuse to get involved anymore because I have been their mediator my whole life. 

But at some point recently, I got fed up with it. I told her that I have the same mental health issues that my sister has, and that I never asked for help because I saw how she treated my sister when she was vocal about her own neglected needs. My mom started crying and told me she’s sorry. She said she doesn’t know how to talk to my sister and that she feels heartbroken at their lack of contact. She said she has always felt guilty about the way we grew up, but doesn’t know if it’s possible to make up for it.

I told her if she can’t even reach out to my sister to apologize, she is being a bad mother. I told her the fact that she’s felt bad about it and yet never acknowledged how her behavior affected us before now is really disappointing.

She hung up the phone and we haven’t spoken since then. Now I feel bad for not giving her an opportunity to make things better.

My boyfriend is a giant kid and was playing with other kids in the play park, helping them get onto the obstacle course, making sure nobody was getting hurt or landing on top of each other. But for the most part he was around my daughter because he was playing with her and her friends. 

Her dad comes up to me again and tells me that my boyfriend is stalking my child and her dad can't play with her because my boyfriend is around, mind you I asked my boyfriend to back off so he is not playing with my kid, He's just simply in the same room as her.

42,1fgrgd7,AITA for wanting my marriage to be balanced?,"Heya, me (33m) and my now wife (30f) moved in together in 2020 when COVID happened, and when we sat down to set some houserules she was pretty clear that she won't be a housewife, and she never wants to be one, we both had jobs and we agreed to split chores down the middle. She worked from home and her work was not that demanding, to be honest most days you could see her playing videogames or watching tv ""while at work"" I did have to drive to where I work so I was less time at home. And from the very start she straight up refused to cook, clean, wash the dishes or do laundry when it was her turn. So most of the time I had to do all those things and got not much free time in my hands. 

Some time later she was informed that she had to return to the office but since moved in from another state it was not viable to do so, so she quit. We had a lot of discussions about chores and years later the issue has improved dramatically, if we measured who does what I would think that maybe were 50/50, the difference being that I have a job and she does not. 

I grew up in a traditional family, dad worked, mom took care of the kids and I know for a fact that it can work. Not to brag but I have a great income, were not rich but we have a house of our own, all our needs are met and were able to save money. That said, I do work a lot of hours, I work easily from 60-70 hours a week. I'm not demanding that she becomes a traditional housewive, but I often feel that our relationship is not balanced.

i want to clarify that i love her to death and believe me, she makes me feel so loved in every other way that are not acts of service.

Heya, me (33m) and my now wife (30f) moved in together in 2020 when COVID happened, and when we sat down to set some houserules she was pretty clear that she won't be a housewife, and she never wants to be one, we both had jobs and we agreed to split chores down the middle. She worked from home and her work was not that demanding, to be honest most days you could see her playing videogames or watching tv ""while at work"" I did have to drive to where I work so I was less time at home. And from the very start she straight up refused to cook, clean, wash the dishes or do laundry when it was her turn. So most of the time I had to do all those things and got not much free time in my hands. 

Some time later she was informed that she had to return to the office but since moved in from another state it was not viable to do so, so she quit. We had a lot of discussions about chores and years later the issue has improved dramatically, if we measured who does what I would think that maybe were 50/50, the difference being that I have a job and she does not. 

I grew up in a traditional family, dad worked, mom took care of the kids and I know for a fact that it can work. Not to brag but I have a great income, were not rich but we have a house of our own, all our needs are met and were able to save money. That said, I do work a lot of hours, I work easily from 60-70 hours a week. I'm not demanding that she becomes a traditional housewive, but I often feel that our relationship is not balanced.

i want to clarify that i love her to death and believe me, she makes me feel so loved in every other way that are not acts of service. She often says that she feels that she doesn't do enough at home, but at the same time I don't see her doing an extra effort or anything to remedy that.

43,1fgrgat,AITA for excluding my niece from a family tradition after finding out she’s an affair baby?,"I (35F) became the guardian of my nieces (15F, 14F, 12F) when my brother and his wife passed away a decade ago. My brother was black, while my sister in law was white. My two oldest nieces take after their dad and have light brown skin, brown eyes, and 4A curls. Meanwhile, my youngest niece inherited her mother’s pale skin, green eyes, and 3B hair. My youngest niece has always passed for white, but I never thought anything of it. I did a DNA test a while back and found out I was around 30% white, so I assumed that’s why my niece had pale skin.

It’s too long of a story to get into, so I’ll just say it outright. Two months ago I found out that my youngest niece was not biologically my brother’s child. My SIL had an affair with a white man, meaning my youngest niece is fully white. It has taken a while for me to process this, but during that time I have made sure that my niece never felt guilty over her parentage. I assured her that it wasn’t her fault what her mother did, and I didn’t love her any less.

I’ve created somewhat of a family tradition where, before the start of the school year, I braid my niece’s hair in protective hairstyles. I decided to braid their hair myself since braiders in my area charge way too much, and over time it’s become a way for us to bond.

However, ever since finding out about her heritage, I don’t think it’s the best idea to braid my youngest niece’s hair. I told her that I would be happy to style do her hair and give her any hairstyle she wants, as long as it’s not braids. She knows what cultural appropriation is, but she begged me to just braid her hair, telling me that she didn’t want to feel left out. I’ve tried explaining to her that braiding her that braiding her hair could actually damage it, but she insisted on braiding it and started crying when I refused.

I feel guilty. I don’t have anyone to speak to in real life about this because I can’t tell anyone about the affair, so I’m writing this post to get your opinions.

44,1fgrcte,AITA for leaving my stuff in a shared appartment while I was away for 5 months?,"Some context: I (22F) have rented my appartment for 2 years. One year ago, my friend (25F) moved in, and we really had a good and unproblematic cohabitation throughout the year. We are quite close, and I do not hold any grudges against her. I am just posting about this issue to see if people agree with my stance or if I really am in the wrong.

In the context of my studies, I have to do an internship from September to January, and found something in a city across the country. I will not be coming back on holidays because it is too far away, but I will live back in the same appartment in January and for two more years at least. For this reason, I made a deal with another friend for her to live in my room with my roommate until I return. Both agreed and were pleased with this since they would split the rent (knowing that I will still pay a little part of the rent since I will be back). 

I spent the summer at my parents' and emptied my room in the end of June for the new roommate to be at ease, obviously. However, I left some packages and utilities in the storage room because we have not used it for the two years I have lived here, and I cannot afford to move my things out and put them at my parents' or my new appartment, since both are really far away. I also left some dry food (rice, pasta...) as well as three things in the fridge for both my roommates to use, instead of throwing it away.

I thought everything was okay since my roommate never mentioned anything and did not say anything when I did all this, nor when we saw each other again in August. But a few days ago, the day before the new roommate was supposed to arrive, she sent me a vocal message saying that I was taking too much space for both her and the roommate. When I told her that I had discussed it with the roommate and that she did not care and was pleased with the food, she insisted that it was selfish and disrespectful, since I was leaving for 5 months. She also reproached me to have misinformed her about the date of arrival of the new roommate, because I had given her the date she had told me, while I told her that they still had to discuss it since she wasn't sure about the date yet.

I was hurt by what she said because it seemed to come out from nowhere, and because I had no choice but to leave my stuff there since I will be coming back in a few months. I also made sure to empty my room and discuss the kitchen bit with the new roommate, but where I might be TA is that I never really explained what and why I left to the current roommate.

In order to alleviete some stress i enjoy playing some games with close friends, normally building games and the like.

Instead of being there to comfort them I chastised them for pinging everyone. I didn't insult them or berate them, just told them to not put it in main channel and don't ping everyone. 

It was a cold and cruel thing to do, the only reason why I did that was because it reminded me of my own grandfather and how just kinda helpless I am too it, it just made me angry and I took that out on a stranger who didn't deserve it. I later did aplogize to them about it, I poured my heart into that apology and it's a moment I deeply regret. 

However due to my actions alot of my closest friends of many years have cut all contact with me entirely. It's their choice, but I think their response is unjustified/extreme. This is one of the only times I've ever snapped in front of them and my coldness was directed at them either, I also made amends with the person that I was cruel too.

46,1fgr67m,AITA for not inviting my mother’s family to my wedding?,"Hello! 2025 bride here and stuck in a place I didn’t expect to be. 

A little back story for my mom’s family. My mom left my dad when I was 3 and took my sisters with her. My mom didn’t start visiting me until my dad filed for child support. 

Once she did, she would have me every other weekend per court order. IF she showed up I went to my grandmas. Other times she didn’t show up after calling saying she was on the way. 

Fast forward to 13 my stepdad died in a car accident. This is where everything went downhill and she off the deep end of drug addiction. I spent the next 7-8 years with my mom in and out of jail, telling me not to tell my dad’s family about things, asking me for money and to bail her out. 

When I joined the military she didn’t write me any letters. I had accepted that maybe she had passed because I told my dad not to bring me home from training if she did. When I got my finally phone call home for a hour my dad and stepmom asked me if I had talked to her. I called her and she told me her letters got lost in the mail.

The older I got the more I kept a distance, some due to my job, but mostly due to the stress and anxiety the relationship caused me. 

I never expected my mom to live to see me get married and just kind of accepted that. 

Well, just over a year ago she got sober. I am beyond happy to know my mom has overcome the addiction, and we were working on a better relationship. 

Last month my now fiancé proposed. My best friend and him planned it and it was a big secret. My dad and stepmom asked if they thought I would want my mom there. They decided I wouldn’t because her and my dad haven’t been in the same room in over 20 years, they have seen the anxiety just a phone call with her causes me, and they have heard about what I experienced growing up. 

I messaged my mom’s family group chat as we have been working on mending the relationship. Everyone was excited and tried to call. I told my mom we were at dinner but I would call her later. 

My mom asked how it happened and I began explaining it. When she realized my dad was there she started crying and hung up on me. I was so upset and went back in to my fiancé. My friends and him were able to cheer me up but it still sucked in the moment bad. 

I have pretty much settled on not having any of the family from her side at my wedding. Knowing how the family works if anyone was invited they would all tell each other and everyone would show up. So while there are members I want there like my grandma and my little brother I don’t trust that I can just invite a few. 

I cannot go to family functions with their family for more than a hour without becoming extremely anxious and this is my wedding day with the love of my life. I don’t think I should put myself in a position to not have a good day due to my anxiety.

47,1fgr49a,AITA for telling my sister I would never let her watch my kids?,"My sister offered to take my 3 year old with her home to Chicago for a month to help me out.

My (30F) older sister (48F) lives in Chicago and we live in North Carolina. I am the youngest of 9 and I never formed a relationship with her. I tried a long time ago but it just didn't work out.

A little background of our relationship:

In her childhood, our mother allowed some bad things to happen to her, so I genuinely believe that she took her frustrations out on me instead of our mother so I try to give her grace. In my childhood, she treated me like a step sister. She treated me like I was a nuisance to be around. She would call me names and would pick at me about the smallest things. She would show blatant favoritism by getting my cousins gifts and not getting me anything as a child. She would do this in front of me. She would talk down to me. She never tried spending quality time with me. Whenever she would talk to me, it would always be about what I was doing wrong. There's so much more but I would be typing all day. 

Now that we're older, she doesn't even call me. I have called her on numerous occasions to check in on her. For example, when she was admitted into the hospital because she had an allergic reaction AND when she almost cut her fingers off, I called her. 

When my daughter was in the hospital, she never called to check on me to see if I was okay or to see if my baby was okay. If anything she made me feel guilty for being in the hospital with my child while she was having HEART surgery. She literally asked me, ""Why has our mother been watching your children for 2 weeks"" ... they knew why. When I reminded her about my child's heart surgery, she says to me, ""Well. Your other children miss you and you need to get them. I'm not sure why you're so concerned about your child in the hospital. She won't remember any of it when she gets older.""

She asked me why I said no. And I told her, ""Im not leaving my child for an entire month with someone I don't trust in an entire different state. I don't even KNOW you. You've never showed empathy towards me or her in the past and you expect me to leave her with you. I would never in my life do that."" 

Now everyone is calling me an asshole because I hurt her feelings.

She confided that she was struggling with her mental health after her ex-boyfriend moved out. I offered to help clean her place without charge, as I knew no one should live in filth.

51,1fgpwwt,AITA to want my bf to want to spend with me,"I (24 F) had asked my boyfriend (29 M) a month ago to come to a carnival in my hometown on Friday and to my cousin's quinceañera on Saturday. He lives an hour away, and I know the drive can be exhausting for him, so I gave him the option to choose which event he wanted to attend. I made it clear he didn’t have to stay the entire time—just showing up for a few hours would make me happy. It's hard for us to spend time together because of our work schedules; one of us is always working. When I first brought it up, he agreed to both events, and I was really excited, looking forward to spending the weekend with him and having some fun.

On Thursday, he apologized and told me he was backing out of the quinceañera because he was tired from working 12-hour shifts (Tuesday through Thursday) and didn’t feel comfortable driving late. I understood, as I didn’t want him driving while exhausted and risking something happening on the way. But at least we still had the carnival on Friday to look forward to.

Fast forward to Friday: he tells me he’s been sleeping all day because he’s tired, which is normal for him on his day off after long shifts—his body catches up on missed sleep. He asked me what we should do about our plans. On one hand, I was really looking forward to spending time with him, but on the other, I didn’t want to push him. I’d rather he rest and get the sleep he needs. So, I told him it was okay to stay home and rest, telling him that there will always be more carnivals, but there’s only one of him. I was also hoping that if he felt better on Saturday, he might change his mind and come down for a few hours.

Later that Friday night, after I got home from the carnival, I asked how his day had been. He told me he had gone to our mutual friend's movie night. I felt disappointed. Even though I told him he didn’t have to come with me, it kind of felt like he ditched me and just didn’t want to spend time together. What also bothered me was that he didn’t mention it until I asked. Earlier this month, I had asked him to watch Halloween movies with me, but he said he wanted to wait until October. Yet, he ended up watching Halloween movies at the movie night. It wasn’t a surprise either—he knew ahead of time what movies they were going to watch.

I feel hurt and disappointed because I go out of my way to spend time with him and do things together, even when I’m tired, because I'm happy just to spend a little time with him. But it feels like, when it comes to choosing between doing things with me and doing things with our mutual friend group, he prioritizes them. AITA for feeling this way?

My biggest issue with my place is accessing it. The landlord never briefed me on how to get in and out of the gate here, which has led to multiple accessibility problems. Just today, I was stuck outside for two hours from a little after 3 AM to 5 AM because I didn’t know how to get back in without someone else having come in or out. That’s how I’ve been getting in so far but it didn’t work last night.

I get that I could’ve asked about accessibility which is why I’m not evading any role I may have in this incident but at the same time that’s something they should’ve briefed me on right away after I moved in without me having to ask about it. 

My first issue was literally on the first day I moved in. I couldn’t get my door to unlock and it took a few hours for me to get back inside. I basically wasn’t given the important briefing about living here, and it’s been disorganized.  They were supposed to bring me my physical lease on my second day, and I still to this day haven’t signed one. Before I moved in, the landlord made a big deal about me being able to live close to my campus since I don’t have a car. They pushed this like they care about my situation, yet it feels like this place is 'technically accessible' but not really functional in the real sense for me. They said they didn’t feel comfortable with my previous situation, without even knowing what I was really dealing with.

Right before I caved in, the landlord said before I moved in that there were other people interested in my room/unit and were telling me about my other roommates that were already lined up. I’ve been here for 3 weeks, and there is still a room that is empty. Just recently, someone was brought in to look at it, so I’m starting to feel like they were being deceitful about the roommates being figured out for some reason.

I don’t even like my unit as much as I need to and, rent is due tomorrow, and I don’t think this is worth the money.

54,1fgpij4,AITA for not inviting my mother’s family to my wedding?,"Hello! 2025 bride here and stuck in a place I didn’t expect to be. 

A little back story for my mom’s family. My mom left my dad when I was 3 and took my sisters with her. My mom didn’t start visiting me until my dad filed for child support (when he went to file he learned that she had already filed for child support despite not taking care of me or seeing me at all).

Once she did, she would have me every other weekend per court order. IF she showed up I went to my grandmas with my sisters until she finally remarried when he was 7. Other times she didn’t show up after calling saying she was on the way, and I remember crying and yelling at my dad asking for my mom. 

While she was with my stepdad she was a bit better about visitations but used to try to get me to go to court to tell the judge I wanted to live with her. My stepdad was never really fond of me but I enjoyed the time with my mom. 

Fast forward to 13 my stepdad died in a car accident. This is where everything went downhill. My mom got the life insurance money and went off the deep end of drug addiction. I spent the next 7-8 years with my mom in and out of jail, telling me not to tell my dads family about things, asking me for money and to bail her out (I was 13-22 around this time). 

I remember working my first job and my mom asking me for money constantly and never paying me back. She didn’t come to my highschool graduation, or any sporting/band events before I graduated. 

When I joined the military she didn’t write me any letters. I had accepted that maybe she had passed because I told my dad not to bring me home from training if she did. When I got my finally phone call home for a hour my dad and stepmom asked me if I had talked to her. I called her and she told me her letters got lost in the mail. This seems unlikely as I had received letters from everyone else to include my stepdads parents and my sister. 

The older I got the more I kept a distance, some due to my job, but mostly due to the stress and anxiety the relationship caused me. 

I never expected my mom to live to see me get married and just kind of accepted that. 

Well, just over a year ago she got sober. I am beyond happy to know my mom has overcome the addiction, and we were working on a better relationship. 

Last month my now fiancé proposed. My best friend and him planned it and it was a big secret. My dad and stepmom asked if they thought I would want my mom there. They decided I wouldn’t because her and my dad haven’t been in the same room in over 20 years, they have seen the anxiety just a phone call with her causes me, and they have heard about what I experienced growing up. 

We had the proposal exactly how I dreamed. My dad, stepmom, brothers from his side, grandparents, and my fiancés immediate family all there. All the people who supported me through everything growing up and my new soon to be family. 

I messaged my mom’s family group chat as we have been working on mending the relationship. Everyone was excited and tried to call. I told my mom we were at dinner but I would call her later. 

After dinner we went to a bar with friends and my mom called me. I rushed outside to FaceTime with her and show her my ring and tell her about it. Initially I was excited to feel like I finally had my mom being a mom to me since it’s been a long time since she felt like my mom. 

My mom asked how it happened and I began explaining it. When she realized my dad was there she started crying and hung up on me. I was so upset and went back in to my fiancé. My friends and him were able to cheer me up but it still sucked in the moment bad. 

I reached back out to explain why the decision was made, and why I stand by it. I have tried to explain to her why I have a hard time being close with her and the trauma I have unpacked in therapy over the years. She continued each time we talked to turn it around on me for not trying, and on my dad for not allowing her to be apart of my life. Despite my distinct memories of her being invited to so many things and not showing up. 

I have tried a few times to have a civil discussion with her and she always turns it into an argument about how my dad ruined it all for her. 

I have pretty much settled on not having any of the family from her side at my wedding. Knowing how the family works if anyone was invited they would all tell each other and everyone would show up. So while there are members I want there like my grandma and my little brother I don’t trust that I can just invite a few. 

I cannot go to family functions with their family for more than a hour without becoming extremely anxious and this is my wedding day with the love of my life. I don’t think I should put myself in a position to not have a good day due to my anxiety.

Me and my husband decided this was perfect since it was spacious, had a big garden, wasn’t on a main road and was close to good schools and doctors practices for when the kids would be old enough to attend. My sister is 36f and she has a daughter and a husband. Her daughter 8 F (we will call her Mary) has always been a loud and confident child. She’s one of them kids who does dancing and acts in all the school plays and who the whole family adores. I have never really taken a liking to Mary just because of how loud she is. When I first had my son and my sister and Mary came to see him for the first time, she was asking me about maternity and things that wasn’t really any of her business.

My sister didn’t speak to me for 2 weeks because she didn’t agree with me telling her child that but eventually Mary did apologise “off her own back” or so my sister said.

Mary has really taken it too far over the past month as my husband decided to build a two person swing and a slide set for my kids when they get a bit older. I guess since it’s just sitting there Mary thinks she’s got every right to use it which I’ve never said she could at all. Last night at about 4 30 I looked out my window and saw Mary swinging on the swings. I was furious since it’s my garden and she didn’t even ask me! I went out and basically said to her in a raised tone “This isn’t your garden and these swings aren’t yours you need to leave now”. Mary ran off crying and looking shocked which I did feel bad about. Within an hour I had missed calls from my mum and dad, my two sisters and my brother and countless messages basically saying what I did was wrong and tasteless and is upsetting to a little girl.

Mary has really taken it too far over the past month as my husband decided to build a two person swing and a slide set for my kids when they get a bit older. I guess since it’s just sitting there Mary thinks she’s got every right to use it which I’ve never said she could at all. Last night at about 4 30 I looked out my window and saw Mary swinging on the swings. I was furious since it’s my garden and she didn’t even ask me! I went out and basically said to her in a raised tone “This isn’t your garden and these swings aren’t yours you need to leave now”. Mary ran off crying and looking shocked which I did feel bad about. Within an hour I had missed calls from my mum and dad, my two sisters and my brother and countless messages basically saying what I did was wrong and tasteless and is upsetting to a little girl. When my husband returned from work I told him about the incident and he started freaking out at me saying he told Mary she could use the swings and now he’s messaged my sister and her husband to apologise for my behaviour but I don’t think I’m in the wrong?? It is my garden? So Am I the ahole?",1.0,0.01884712651371956,0,0

58,1fgoo2l,WIBTA if I told my grandma she shouldn't spend money on homeopathy for me?,"My (16m) paternal grandmother is a pretty devout believer in homeopathic medicine. I was raised in a fairly agnostic household, but I believed in it for most of my life by proxy to her. In the last few years, though, I've learned more about it and have become... disillusioned, I suppose? 

I've been diagnosed with ADHD, and upon hearing about this, my grandma has taken me to her specialist a few times to get some treatment. The specialist told me that eventually it would be gone, but after nearly a year of taking pills and powders without significant effect, I stopped taking them entirely, and (by the direction of my parents) have just told her I believe in homeopathy for the past few years. 

However, trips have recently become more frequent. I pretty didn't go to the homeopath for a few months, and my grandma figured that was making the ADHD worse (I've been tired as all hell from school and just switched my ACTUAL meds to a different brand). I've also been diagnosed with anxiety. 

First and foremost, given the amount of schoolwork I have I have almost no free time or free energy to use on going to the homeopath once every week or two on a school day. 

Also, she's said before that I have to believe in the medicine for it to work (which, doesn't that defeat the point of medicine?) and I don't believe in it. I also haven't been having her medicine because it just doesn't work for me. This means she's wasting money on something for me, and I feel super guilty about that. She's very well off and has money to spare, but still.

If I do tell her, though, it might hurt our relationship (which is really good outside of this) because she really believes in this stuff. It'll also reveal that I've been lying to her for a while about it. I've been hearing stories of many of my dad's friends' parents dying, and though she's extremely spry and fit for her age, I just don't know how many years she has left. I would definitely feel like an AH if I were to sour our relationship and she were to pass away on bad terms with me. She's also reacted badly to hints I've dropped that I don't believe in it.

So, would I be the AH if I were to tell my grandma to stop taking me to the homeopath?

60,1fgobff,AITAH for telling my fiancé I don't love him? ,"
Hello there, internet, 

I am just using this platform to get something I want to say out of my system.

If you accidentally stumbled on my post, please ignore it; it's not that important.
Also excuse any mistakes since English isn't my first language.

Everything started about last year, when I had a big ass argument with my parents about not feeling ready for marriage yet. My mother was upset because I am already concerned about a spinster, and I won't have kids if I wait longer for marriage!

My father asked if I was waiting for someone (if I had a secret boyfriend or something). The answer is no; everyone knows around my family that I am the girl who never ever had a crush on a boy before. So I assured them again that ""no, I don't have a romantic partner."" 

That answer upsat my family more, because that's me. I am helpless.

Not like my younger sister, who has been with her high school sweetheart for 9 years now.

Eventually, my mother decided to start accepting marriage proposals for me. It was a very annoying period of my life where I met a man almost every two weeks just to never see them again (rejections from both sides). 

Days passed, and around the start of this year, my sister's boyfriend decided to propose to her. I couldn't be happier for them, but my father didn't give them his blessings (in our culture, if the father says no, it's a no). He said the problem is that he promised himself a long time ago to never wed his younger daughter before her older sister, because that happened in his family between my aunts long ago and caused so much jealousy and drama between the sisters.

So, now my sister and her boyfriend and my mother are blaming me for this. After a few months of their mean treatment, I finally broke and decided to agree on the next man my mother will bring to me.

And so I met a nice guy, let's call him M, around the end of May 2024, older than me, with a decent job, coming from a good family.

We met, we talked, we had a couple arguments (he clearly has trust issues and is a very traditional type of guy; he wants me to be a stay-at-home mom; he wants me to be ready to have kids right away; he wants me to be ready to take care of his parents when they get older, and I am cool with all of that); we found our middle ground, and everything seems to go smoothly (think of it like speed dating).

My father also agreed on my sister's boyfriend, and they're happy again.

Everything is going well so far; our wedding is set to be soon in the next few months.

He seems so excited about starting a family; I am cool about it too.

But he is very concerned that since we are both old, we don't have much time to conceive (I am 28; he is 35), while I am more chill about it. So he started calling me out for not loving him, so I told him, ""Yes, I never said I loved you. We barely know each other for 4 months, and I don't think it's enough time to fall in love with a complete stranger."".",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITAH for telling my fiancé I don't love him?

61,1fgo7yy,AITA for not giving my mother my kids' phone numbers?,"I 36F, have 5 children (17M, 15M, 13M, 11F, 9F). All 5 of my children were born before either of my siblings had children. When my kids were younger, I noticed my mom was favoring my oldest. I called her out on it and it was always an excuse: he's the first grandchild, he needs more attention because we probably mistreat him since he's not my husband's biological child, he needs more love because he doesn't have his bio dad (my husband has been the ONLY dad he knows since he was 7 months old and has NEVER been mistreated or neglected), etc. I let her know favoritism would not be allowed, at all. So, she distanced herself from ALL of my children and focused on my sister's kids. 

My oldest recently went through a military academy and my mom would write to him but in the letters would guilt trip him for not writing her back. He told me 'How can she expect me to write her when she could have called me over the years before I went away and never did.' After my son came back home, previous behavior issues returned and escalated quickly. I was confused and didn't understand why. He dropped out of trade school after 3 days, intentionally sabotaged job interviews, etc.- he just wanted to lay around at home and be catered to. We let him know this was not acceptable and he ran away. I went through his phone hoping to find out where he may have gone and I found out he was telling his 'friends' since he had gotten his diploma, we shouldn't expect him to do anything else. 

My mom immediately blamed me but never called to check in to see if my son had returned or if we had heard from him. 2 days later she called and asked what he was doing.

64,1fgnsew,AITAH for not helping my husband,"UPDATE: He called me seven times yesterday.  I haven't answered once. He has moved on to calling our son, who is also not answering.   

My son and I are going to move forward. We looked up the court docket. He has one felony (4th OUI) and eight misdemeanors all which call for 100 days.   

I am going to file for divorce on Monday.  He has burned every last bridge down to the ground.  I have enough to worry about I don't need him making things harder.  You are all correct. He did this to himself.  

I am not going to deny I am scared. My biggest fear is the same reason I stayed with him so long, financial.  I am going to have to lean on my son a bit and that crushes me, but he and I will be much happier too.

I looked over old text messages he would send while drunk. I would block his verbal abuse and he would call me evil etc.

Thank you all for your love and support. I needed clear vision and the amazing words of so many of you.


I am going to keep this as short as I can.  Me (52f) and my husband (47m) have been married 24 years. We had one child who is now an adult (20m) who is a Junior in college. I hesitate to post this because I don't want all the podcast people to pick this up, please understand how much taking this story from this sub will hurt me and leave this here please. 

My husband is an alcoholic.  I came from a world where people rarely drank. He had promised me he would stop drinking when our son was born,  his reply to that was ""You knew I was a drinker when you married me.""

He had a dui 10 years ago and I supported him through it. He came out of it with 8 years sobriety. 

He fell off the wagon 2 years ago and life has been a series of broken promises, cheating on me and lies. For instance he told his co-workers that he gave out son 60k towards college. Our son has scholarships and loans.

He took my car, without my permission. We knew he was drunk so my son and I went looking for him so we could take back the car. We couldn't find him.

He ended up hitting a semi truck at 2am, smashed into a guard rail and fled the scene.  The state police dogs caught him. No one was hurt but him. 

He is in jail. 10k bail. He asked me to ask his boss (whose wife was hit by a drunk driver last October), and he told me to tell him no. He has burned his bridges with them.

Here where I feel like I am the AH.  He keeps calling me from jail. Asking me to find a way to bail him out. I certainly have no money. I am disabled and my disability check pays the mortgage.  He doesn't give me much money. I stopped sharing a bed with him so he tightened the purse strings tighter. 

So, he is in jail. He is going to stay. He has been calling me begging him to put money into his inmate account.  I need whatever money to pay bills. I already told him I was filing for divorce.  Will I be the asshole if I just block the calls and walk away? Because that's really what I want to do but I feel so guilty.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITAH for not helping my husband UPDATE: He called me seven times yesterday.  I haven't answered once. He has moved on to calling our son, who is also not answering.   

My son and I are going to move forward. We looked up the court docket. He has one felony (4th OUI) and eight misdemeanors all which call for 100 days.   

I am going to file for divorce on Monday.  He has burned every last bridge down to the ground.  I have enough to worry about I don't need him making things harder.  You are all correct. He did this to himself.  

I am not going to deny I am scared. My biggest fear is the same reason I stayed with him so long, financial.  I am going to have to lean on my son a bit and that crushes me, but he and I will be much happier too.

I 18f have a friend 18m and we were hanging out with some others and he’s moving to his university accommodation tomorrow. 

He was talking about everything he had to buy for it and when it got to alcohol he was naming stuff he never drinks. Fruity ciders and mixed flavoured WKD well on top go the big bottle of vod (this man’s go to is usually something devoid of anything sweet) I ask why he bought that then.  

He mentioned he can tolerate them it’s just not his favourite and the reasoning is he knows his entire flat is women and most of his block is women like genuinely 85% or something like that. And freshers events aren’t for a few days after everyone moves in and basically to sum up his reasoning he thinks drinking is a great way to get to know these girls and so he’s bringing woman drinks to share. 

I point out that’s really sad, does he think he’s that bad at socialising that he needs to bribe people to be his friend?

66,1fgnjyk,AITAH for how I got into a relationship with my BF,"I will try and make this as concise as possible but there are a lot of aspects to the situation.

I (30F) was dating a man (41M) for a few months, it fell apart and I was distraught because I really liked this guy so I came up with a plan to try and get him back.

This man had a best friend (33M) who I started talking with more, it became flirtatious and eventually talked about hooking up and started hanging out a bit more. I figured this would get back to my ex eventually and make him jealous and help him realize he liked me still.

Fast forward a month or so and I was going to an event which I knew my ex was also attending with his friend, I had a friend of mine (36M) go with me to say he was my date to help with the jealousy with my ex and I ensured that we stayed within eyesight of my ex.

My ex's best friend ended up getting involved in the situation and confronted me thinking we were going to be together which I did not think would happen and this just added drama.

I denied anything at all happening with my BFs best friend and they eventually ended their friendship.

Here's where IMBTA, a good friend of mine (27F) knows the situation and says I manipulated my now BF to be with me and also ended a good friendship. That he would not be with me if he hadn't seen me with a ""date"" and that I should confess everything that actually happened that day.

My defense is my BFs best friend willingly went along with talking with me and hanging out which he should not have done to his best friend, I just encouraged it. If this happened with me it could have happened to anyone else he dated and eventually the friendship would have ended anyway.

I was not honest with my BF about what all happened between me and his best friend, but we weren't together at the time so I was not cheating and nothing happened between us once me and my BF got together.

As far as my ""date"" I don't think I did anything wrong, I did not force my BF to get back together with me, I just ensured that the situation was one that would help my cause.

We have now been together officially and very happily for a few months so it clearly was all for the greater good.  I don't think I manipulated anything and I know we would have eventually ended up together, I just sped up the timeline.

So AITAH? Was this deceit? Or just a woman doing what needed to be done to bring back the man I wanted?

67,1fgnbxe,WIBTA if I don’t give my brother his birthday present?,"My husband (25M) and I (25F) went to a baseball game for my brother’s (12) birthday last night. My brother can be very sweet when he wants to be but is currently through some hard life transitions and has been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiance Disorder, on top of the start of puberty and pre-teenage angst. He gets picked on at school and acts out towards authority and our other sibling.  

Once the game ended, we were leaving and he was playing Pokémon Go on his phone. He got a snorlax and named him “Chonk” which I found funny at first. Then he points to my husband (who is in a blue raincoat) and goes “Don’t they look identical?” and started laughing. 

For context, my husband is very private about his struggle with body image and the number on the scale but it’s nonetheless something he has struggled with his whole life. It’s a massive trigger and I saw his face fall the moment my brother said that. I don’t think I’ve ever been so mad at a kid before. I pulled my brother aside immediately to reprimand him and explain why we don’t call people words like that. I told him he owes his BIL an apology and he gave him a mediocre one. I didn’t think a baseball stadium was an appropriate place to get into the intricate details of body image issues and watching our words with a 12 year old so I let it rest and debriefed with my husband when we got home. The one thing we agreed that made this comment different than one from a stranger is that my brother said it with such malice and barely apologized after. There’s been other instances of similar insults and name calling towards other people in our family from him but it’s been the first time it was turned at either of us.

I’m going to be seeing my brother and family again today for cake and presents and was planning on talking to him more afterwards since we’d be in the privacy of home. My husband was supposed to come but for obvious reasons needs some space for now. He knows my brother is still a kid so he’s trying to not taking it personally and see it as a teaching moment; the comment was still a trigger though and it has brought up a lot of past trauma that he’s working through.

I moved back to my old school which is a story for another time but I was informed that my friend A (14F) had a birthday party on the same day as a concert I had planned on going to. it wouldn't have been a huge deal if the concert was in the same city as I live in. it wasn't. it was in Nottingham. A was pissed off and didn't tell me directly and seemed to make a joke about it to my memory. A spent the day with my two other friends, B (15M) and C (15M), which i had no problem with. i apologized because the concert was planned over half a year in advance because the tickets were a Christmas present. I would've gone if I could've but I couldn't. I live in a city very far away from the concert venue. I'm English so I had to travel down to said city. 

this wasn't the end of the issue though. after the concert, which was great, my mental health started going downhill due to the stress of school and GCSEs. I was getting snappier because something else happened involving my exam desk, my candidate number and legal name. my mental health isn't any better but A, B and C confronted me and told me that I was killing the mood. i felt horrible and apologized. my instinct was to isolate myself and try to reflect and get better.

As it was announced last year that a movie would be produced, we made an agreement to attend the movie premiere weekend together, and cosplay as the main characters. We purchased cosplays together and created a group chat. Outside of this, we were not particularly close, and understood that Reanne had her own friends/commitments, and she often took weeks to reply to our texts. 

Two weeks ago, the movie was announced in our country, and I asked on the group chat if we were free to watch during the premiere weekend. Beatrice said that she was busy and would not be watching with us, while Sophia said she was free both days, so we agreed on Saturday tentatively. After 5 days, as Reanne did not reply, I pinged her and asked if she would be coming, but she did not reply to that as well. Two days later (a week before the Saturday of the movie) I purchased two tickets with Sophia and sent the receipt in the group chat. 

Two days before the movie, Reanne replied and said that she had been busy with other friends, and apologised for her late reply. She said that she was not free on Saturday and asked if we could get tickets for Sunday instead. As I felt that she was not respectful of my time, I did not reply, and neither did Sophia. After the movie on Saturday, we replied that we had already watched the movie and cosplayed as a duo, and asked her to attend on Sunday herself.

I asked if she would mind watching in two weeks time, and we could go with Beatrice as well. She said that she would not want to be the only cosplayers attending, and insisted on us going tomorrow, saying that I was disrespecting her as I left her behind in the planning. I told her that if she did not reply for more than ten days, she could not expect to be included or have her time respected. She then called me an asshole and hung up. 

She called Sophia and told her the same thing, and Sophia just told her no and hung up. Beatrice told us that we have no obligation to go with Reanne but that we could have been nicer, and asked us to apologise. I refused, as did Sophia, and we just closed the group chat.

I cant be in my room studying or having alone time because we always need to look out for the baby. It gets annoying at times to have him around.

yesterday was my daughters first birthday, we didn’t do anything much, but my mum and sister came to visit and my niece (7) came too. for my daughters birthday, i bought her few little bits, but her main present was a foam ball pit with little plastic balls. 

my daughter absolutely loves the ball pit, she got in it straight away and loves kicking her legs in the balls. my niece, also loves the ball pit, and i’ve got no problem with her also playing with it, but my daughter gets really mad when my niece also sits in it with her. it’s not really big enough for both of them and my daughter gets very frustrated and angry. she was crying and generally getting upset. i asked my niece to get out for a bit and let my daughter play in it seeing as it’s her present. 

my sister said i shouldn’t have told her not to play in it with her and my daughter has to learn to share. i told my sister that my daughter absolutely does not need to share her birthday present and if she wants to play in it, she should be allowed to without my niece bothering her. 

my sister called me selfish and an AH, but the way i see it is, it’s my child’s birthday, she should be able to play with her presents by herself if she wants. it’s meant for my daughter, not for my niece. it’s her present and if she doesn’t want to share it, she shouldn’t have to.

75,1fgl0tz,AITA for booking a plane ticket myself because if not i’ll miss the flight? ,"Am i the asshole for not waiting for my parents to book a plane ticket? 
I (17f) made plans to travel after my bday in September because i finished school and don’t want to start working or go to university right away. My boyfriend (m20)  offered me to go to africa with his family for some months because they own a country house in a nice (safe) place and I could get to know the city more and have a vacation away from home (Germany). We’re planing to move in together and come back for university in march. 

My parents never really liked my bf and made that very clear and once i told them i will be traveling with him they blackmailed and threatened me. 
After a lot of arguments for weeks they suggested that they will pay for my flight and come with me for some days but under the condition that i won’t book it myself. Of course i agreed to that but till today we didn’t book anything and they keep changing their mind about if they wanna pay for me and join me. 

I planned on flying in two weeks and since my parents asked me not to book alone i asked them repeatedly when they were planning to book. I also told them the price is getting more expensive everyday and the seats are being booked fast. They just kept telling me i’m being rude for only caring about money and till today we didn’t book anything because everyday there is a new reason for why they don’t want to book yet. 

I told them that i would be booking it myself then but they’re still welcome to join me once they made up their mind because i don’t want to risk missing the flight. 
Then they threatened me that if i actually book the ticket alone me and my bf both are not welcome to come back here and i won’t see them again. 

Does that make me the asshole for not willing to wait for my parents anymore to book the ticket because i will miss my flight?




Edit: I will be 18 when i travel and i’m not financially dependent on my parents because i worked and saved enough up. Once me and my bf come back for university i can afford the deposit and rent for an apartment.

76,1fgkyf7,AITA My friend has started to cut contact with me and I feel at fault,"For privacy I will just use the first name of my friends and not give out where we live and the account i am posting this on isn't personal because this is my porn account so if you look through my stuff I don't care because I don't use reddit much because I have a life lol another warning I am not the best with writing so if it sounds weird or I miss spell something don't crucifie me I am just a simple man 

So this goes back to the before times early 2000s when I was 7 years old my parents were able to get a house to america because the market crashed so we came here from Mexico and moved in my dad already had a job and since my mom only had to take care of me and my brother she stayed at home anyways since everything was new to us we didn't really know anyone I had no friends no nothing a blank canvas if you will but because I was so young I didn't know english so it was double hard for me to meet anyone at least ONE friend until we meet our neighbors from behind the wall they had a boy my age his name was marcus we meet and at first the only way we actually communicated was toys and games. He was my first and best friend later on I was able to pick up english fast because of shows and school marcus later moved away I was sad but able to learn a lot from him I went to 1st and 2nd grade at a school near by us later moved schools 3rd and 4th rolled around and I am put back at the sister school next to the original 5th grade is when I meet him again marcus he remembered me and introduced me to his friend group which later I was a part of we were all close together all guys I know a real suasage party I get it but those were who we were a group close from 5th to 7th grade because I later was moved to a private school to get better grades stupid parents trying to make me smart anyways I still kept in contact with them phones were really popular now so we had them. I would text here and there we would still hangout even at each other's birthdays and random hangouts I later convinced my parents to move me back to the high school I wanted which was where they were 11th and 12th I served but it was the greatest 2 years I got out of high-school I even meet my girlfriend on the last year but anyways after high-school everything dies down I got hit hard we that less and less hangouts because we all worked or started going to college I dropped out because I couldn't afford it but I worked everyday to later move out with my girlfriend (spoiler we got a house 2 months ago) I still hung out when I could but marcus hung out less and less making excuses and lying about it. It was so funny to us because he would use the same excuse ""it's my [fill any relative you can think of]'s birthday I can't go"" sometimes he would use the same relative weekly which was funny because we would call him out on it and he wouldn't reply. It just became common to us that he would flake out on us last minute or not show up it was just better to not keep our hopes up. I would still make time to talk and call when I could to the last remaining friend group we still have Alexis, JJ, Will and even Nick can't forget about him we lost a lot of others along the way them not being close anymore or turning into real pieces of shit but that is bound to happen life is life but marcus would still come to big events like when JJ got married it felt like the group was back together again. And best of all we had girls so we didn't have to act gay every now and then men get desperate okay.

Anyways that was the last time we kinda hung out with marcus because we would stop replying to the group chat, texts, or even calls I could only text on his girls posts sometimes because she would actually give me updates on him like how he was doing or if he wanted to hangout or if he could even hangout. Later at a hangout our girls were talk and asking if marcus always acted like this or was his girl being toxic and controlling him we guys don't really care but I guess Alexis really is two faced because he straight up just lies and makes up that that's all we were talking about talking shit and disrespecting him by talking about him behind his back. Marcus calls me to say he doesn't like my girlfriend and that it's fucked up to talk about behind his back which I never do because if I have a problem with you I will tell about it to your face we don't talk for a while because life happens and we later go watch spiderman across the spider verse good film and his girlfriend is there I tell her I apologize if you were told the ladies were talking about you but that were just asking a question we wouldn't talk behind your guys backs like that she accepted the apology and we moved on but marcus would still not talk to us it got to the point where months would go by and it would be point less to text and not hear anything so we kinda just gave up but I didn't I would still text him and his girl updates evert now and then because I like to keep in contact.

But this is when the beginning of the end started. This started when his girl  posted a while back about her and marcus in their 4th year together i asked her if that's really how long it has been she confirmed it and i accidentally said that we marcus, his fiancé, tianna and me should go on a double date because i said ""they are the only couple that we really know as of right now"" and she asked ""what happened with JJ and his girl"" i in this situation said too much and left it as i can't say it's not my place because they ended up divorcing marcus was so out of the loop from everyone that he didn't even know this happen because he doesn't check on us I said a petty comment saying maybe if you checked on us you would know and to call me some time because you don't text and i pasted it off passive aggressively because the last time he texted or called was march and i called and text him multiple times and no response.

I sent him a personal text explaining my self because after 3 days no answer he texted me saying we still brothers I sent him a personal message because i have been meaning to send something to him because he still is special to me but my message summary was hey friendships are two way streets i make time and effort to text and call and try and spend time with you and i am not feeling that from you the last time i saw him in person was a year ago so that's why i texted that.
So i guess he texted me saying don't make this gay and that he doesn't care about the past but that goes against what he does later with what happened so one day he actually got to play with me and alexis so it was good for the first hour until you know us we joke about a lot of stuff but it started hitting when he told alexis on stream (yeah he streams)  about the text that i am gay for him i can't stop crying about him not texting me anymore and stuff around those lines i was a little hurt that he would joke about that stuff when i was trying to be personal with him but i was like whatever i am actually concerned and wondering why doesn't he reply to anyone months on end and you know alexis he is two faced when it comes to this stuff so he just hypes up marcus and laughs to keep it going so I'm like whatever.
And so we continue making jokes until i ask about how his family is doing and if his cousins are good and still live next to him and he said ""oh you guys don't know but my cousin nicky is gay now he has a boyfriend and everything"" and alexis starts laughing so i assume he was joking and i saw bullshit so i add ""yeah i heard he is trans now yeah"" and he gets so mad saying ""no he is fucking not"" gets super explosive about it and i say ""well i support his decision either way idk why can't you"" and he gets super heated say hey i don't talk about your family don't talk about mine so i ask ""stop are we being serious right now because i thought we were still jokeing"" and he says ""i don't talk about how you and tianna talk shit behind my back or how Adrian got a hoe pregnant"" (Adrian is my brother who now has a kid) and alexis starts saying ooooo and just hyping him up making it feel like a joke still because it's starting to not feel like a joke and he isn't helping and i say ""will I'm sorry your from c hall (a part of our old school where theh sent lower i.q. kids) because i thought we were still joking i didn't see the line because alexis is here laughing"" and marcus is telling me don't come over anymore it's canceled (we planned on watching deadpool 3 together like old times).

And i am saying ""don't cancel this is the only time i actually get to see him in a year and i don't want to fight over this i just want to hangout and spend time together"" and he just leaves the game but stays in the discord and me and alexis are talking and alexis is saying ""i fucked up"" and i ask ""why is it that he can say all this personal shit to everyone and it's only when i go along with it drama starts and he gets mad cancels the plans and i tell him how he doesn't text me or nick or jj or anyone except alexis and his friend sam"" alexis starts defending him saying ""i shouldn't talk about his family like that and i should see the line because i crossed it"" and i am telling him ""bruh i am sorry i didn't see the line we have been joking about stuff like this and you weren't helping laughing and cheering him on"" and that is when i say i am sorry i just wanted to spend time with you guys and not fight and marcus exploding like this made it feel like he just wanted to have an excuse on not going.

Marcus puts his headset back on saying for me not to come to his house and i saying ""why i am sorry i just wanna spend time with you and everyone"" he then says ""i am begging you don't come over because i will start a fight"" and i said ""marcus no you aren't gonna fight me"" he replied ""what you think i can't"" i say ""that's not what i said I'm sorry okay i will call nick and tell him it's canceled and not to come"" then he said something that actually broke my heart because for the longest time it felt like he didn't wanna be friends with me anymore the way he treats me the way he doesn't like my girlfriend the way he even jokes with me taking stabs and bring up old stuff thinking it's okay to expose my secrets i tell him he said ""i don't care about nick it's not about him it's about you, i don't wanna see you, i don't wanna hear from you, i don't care about you"" it broke me that's all i needed to hear from all the past years it came to this i felt it through his actions i just needed to hear them ""that's all i needed to hear i have my answer now bye"" i disconnected from discord logged off and cried I was raised to never cry because it shows weakness and I couldn't help it and I didn't want my girlfriend to see me cry so I hid in the closet and let it out.

I called nick shortly after saying I'm sorry for ruining the day because i can't go because i said something i shouldn't have said and i know now how he feels about me and i rather not speak with him anymore i explained everything that happened and nick heard me out and he agreed that marcus doesn't deserve my attention anymore all the effort i put in contacting him is a waste of time because i have my answer and i am sad to say it but i felt relieved i know now not to waste my time waiting to hear from him worried to hear from him hoping that maybe this time he will come and actually spend time like the past but i don't have to do that anymore i don't have that in the back of my mind anymore and (ej is nick's older brother) ej said it best he said ""marcus felt like a part time friend but that's a full-time thing there is no half friends in this world"".

He later called me i didn't answer so he came to my house i don't know how he found my address but JJ was coming to pick me up and he was behind him so he contacted JJ saying what he told you for some reason grouping people that weren't involved for some reason he came over thinking i don't know what saying we are good and let's go see the movie i said ""no i got other plans me and JJ are going to go hangout"" i can't forgive him like nothing happened i can't there is too many times i have been thrown to the side forgotten about discarded left outside in the rain because he thought it was funny, because he forgot about me, because he didn't remember. After this I know what I am to him i can't forgive or forget this because there is too much of this where marcus goes drama follows and i am tired i feel numb to this when i shouldn't.

I wouldn't do that to Will or JJ or Nick or Alexis or to even him so my question is why should I? Why should I just be tossed aside when I treated him like a brother when I would walk through fire just for him because that's what friends do for each other but he wouldn't do that for us. So the reason I typed this all out is because Will told me time will fix the scars I was given this happen in mid July mind you. Should I forgive him? Cut contact with him? Give it time and see if he changes and reaches out? Or Am I the Asshole?

And so we continue making jokes until i ask about how his family is doing and if his cousins are good and still live next to him and he said ""oh you guys don't know but my cousin nicky is gay now he has a boyfriend and everything"" and alexis starts laughing so i assume he was joking and i saw bullshit so i add ""yeah i heard he is trans now yeah"" and he gets so mad saying ""no he is fucking not"" gets super explosive about it and i say ""well i support his decision either way idk why can't you"" and he gets super heated say hey i don't talk about your family don't talk about mine so i ask ""stop are we being serious right now because i thought we were still jokeing"" and he says ""i don't talk about how you and tianna talk shit behind my back or how Adrian got a hoe pregnant"" (Adrian is my brother who now has a kid) and alexis starts saying ooooo and just hyping him up making it feel like a joke still because it's starting to not feel like a joke and he isn't helping and i say ""will I'm sorry your from c hall (a part of our old school where theh sent lower i.q. kids) because i thought we were still joking i didn't see the line because alexis is here laughing"" and marcus is telling me don't come over anymore it's canceled (we planned on watching deadpool 3 together like old times).

And i am saying ""don't cancel this is the only time i actually get to see him in a year and i don't want to fight over this i just want to hangout and spend time together"" and he just leaves the game but stays in the discord and me and alexis are talking and alexis is saying ""i fucked up"" and i ask ""why is it that he can say all this personal shit to everyone and it's only when i go along with it drama starts and he gets mad cancels the plans and i tell him how he doesn't text me or nick or jj or anyone except alexis and his friend sam"" alexis starts defending him saying ""i shouldn't talk about his family like that and i should see the line because i crossed it"" and i am telling him ""bruh i am sorry i didn't see the line we have been joking about stuff like this and you weren't helping laughing and cheering him on"" and that is when i say i am sorry i just wanted to spend time with you guys and not fight and marcus exploding like this made it feel like he just wanted to have an excuse on not going.

Marcus puts his headset back on saying for me not to come to his house and i saying ""why i am sorry i just wanna spend time with you and everyone"" he then says ""i am begging you don't come over because i will start a fight"" and i said ""marcus no you aren't gonna fight me"" he replied ""what you think i can't"" i say ""that's not what i said I'm sorry okay i will call nick and tell him it's canceled and not to come"" then he said something that actually broke my heart because for the longest time it felt like he didn't wanna be friends with me anymore the way he treats me the way he doesn't like my girlfriend the way he even jokes with me taking stabs and bring up old stuff thinking it's okay to expose my secrets i tell him he said ""i don't care about nick it's not about him it's about you, i don't wanna see you, i don't wanna hear from you, i don't care about you"" it broke me that's all i needed to hear from all the past years it came to this i felt it through his actions i just needed to hear them ""that's all i needed to hear i have my answer now bye"" i disconnected from discord logged off and cried I was raised to never cry because it shows weakness and I couldn't help it and I didn't want my girlfriend to see me cry so I hid in the closet and let it out.

I called nick shortly after saying I'm sorry for ruining the day because i can't go because i said something i shouldn't have said and i know now how he feels about me and i rather not speak with him anymore i explained everything that happened and nick heard me out and he agreed that marcus doesn't deserve my attention anymore all the effort i put in contacting him is a waste of time because i have my answer and i am sad to say it but i felt relieved i know now not to waste my time waiting to hear from him worried to hear from him hoping that maybe this time he will come and actually spend time like the past but i don't have to do that anymore i don't have that in the back of my mind anymore and (ej is nick's older brother) ej said it best he said ""marcus felt like a part time friend but that's a full-time thing there is no half friends in this world"".

He later called me i didn't answer so he came to my house i don't know how he found my address but JJ was coming to pick me up and he was behind him so he contacted JJ saying what he told you for some reason grouping people that weren't involved for some reason he came over thinking i don't know what saying we are good and let's go see the movie i said ""no i got other plans me and JJ are going to go hangout"" i can't forgive him like nothing happened i can't there is too many times i have been thrown to the side forgotten about discarded left outside in the rain because he thought it was funny, because he forgot about me, because he didn't remember. After this I know what I am to him i can't forgive or forget this because there is too much of this where marcus goes drama follows and i am tired i feel numb to this when i shouldn't.

I wouldn't do that to Will or JJ or Nick or Alexis or to even him so my question is why should I? Why should I just be tossed aside when I treated him like a brother when I would walk through fire just for him because that's what friends do for each other but he wouldn't do that for us. So the reason I typed this all out is because Will told me time will fix the scars I was given this happen in mid July mind you. Should I forgive him? Cut contact with him? Give it time and see if he changes and reaches out? Or Am I the Asshole?

So I (18F) just moved out with my grandparents for university, on the other side of the country. In short I'm an art student and got my art package from the school.

And here came the problem. My grandmother started to Tidy my school supplies I got from the package. I asked her to stop and that I will do it myself. But she didn't listen and started complaining that ""it will help me finding my supplies better"" as she shoved them into the big wardrobe, I argue a little with her because I like to arrange my own things, to know where to find them at the snap of a finger. 

She didn't listen. And kept tidying all the paper's and things. I let it pass for the moment. And then came the paint and brushes. She just broke the bag the paint has been put in and simply put them in a drawer.

I confronted her about it for breaking the bag containing all the paint tubes and just shoving them into a drawer. (There was some Chinese ink with them and that why I complained. If that thing isn't closed correctly. **GOOD LUCK** to wash it. It stain so hard that if it's fall on your clothes. Their dead.)

So she argued again. Stating that ""it's just paint, It's well preserved and that it be fine"".Those are **art supplies** that I will need for the future 5 years ! If they broke, I'm going to have to pay for replacement. And some of them are expensive, I'm not going to go to the store to buy them every day !

What really annoyed me is that she tried to threw away some of my things. I have an Isabel amiboo and an Harley queen plastic toy offered by my boyfriend, that I keep on my desk. She grabbed them and with some other things, and tried to threw them in the trash. I took them back from her hands and annoyed, ask her what she was doing ? And she responded with ""I'm cleaning your desk. You don't need all that junk"".

And my grandpa back her up with ""now your in university. Your drawings should be the main thing (I don't really know how to explain it but he meant it like It's the only thing I should care from now on).

I responded that No. Drawing might be my ""now work and school project"" but that I am allowed to have other hobby. And tried to argued that he was making a little train like a five year old as a hobby. (He does.)

They called me ungrateful and insolant. Now i'm scared that they enter my room while I'm at school or just to change my trash bag and that they try to throw my things away, without me realizing.

79,1fgjt06,AITA for inviting my friend's ex to my wedding?,"Hello everyone,

I (28F) am getting married in a few months and I'm super excited about it. My fiancé (30M) and I have been together for three amazing years, and we've decided to have a small wedding with our closest friends and family.

Here's where it gets complicated: One of my best friends, Lily (27F), recently went through a tough breakup with her boyfriend, Jake (29M), after a long-term relationship. They were together for about five years, and it wasn't a pretty breakup. Lily and Jake had some real drama, and even though I tried to be supportive, it's hard not to feel the tension whenever they're mentioned in the same sentence.

Jake and I have actually become pretty good friends over the past few years. He's a really nice guy, and I've always appreciated having him in our lives. When I was planning my wedding, I had a moment of panic and realized that I wanted to invite him as well. I thought, ""Hey, he's a part of my life, and I want him to be there to celebrate with me. After all, my wedding is about love, not drama.

Well, when I mentioned my decision to Lily, she was not happy. She accused me of being inconsiderate and selfish and said I should have thought more about her feelings. She feels like I'm choosing Jake over her, and now she's threatening not to come to the wedding if he's invited.

Now I'm stuck in the middle. I understand that the breakup was hard for Lily, but I just wanted to create a happy environment for my wedding, and excluding someone I have a friendship with feels wrong to me. I've tried to explain this to Lily, but she's having none of it and insists that I'm being a terrible friend.

80,1fgjrtp,AITA for refusing to share my inheritance with my siblings even though they’re struggling?,"So, here’s some context. I (28F) am the youngest of three siblings. My parents recently passed away unexpectedly and left behind a will. In the will, my parents left me the majority of their estate, including their house and some savings. My older siblings (34F and 32M) were left significantly less, but they were given a fair amount too.

The reasoning behind this (according to my parents) is that I’ve always been the one taking care of them, helping them out financially, and managing the house. My siblings, on the other hand, have been pretty absent. They’ve always struggled with maintaining jobs, and I’ve bailed them out financially several times. My parents believed I would use the inheritance responsibly, whereas they weren’t sure about my siblings.

Here’s where things get tricky: Both of my siblings are now in a financial crisis. They’ve come to me asking if I’d be willing to share more of my inheritance to help them out. They’re struggling with rent, and one of them has medical bills they can’t cover. They’ve accused me of being selfish and not “doing the right thing” since I have more than they do now.

The thing is, I’ve already helped them out so many times over the years, often at the cost of my own financial security. I feel like my parents left things this way for a reason, and I should honor their wishes. I’ve worked hard to get where I am, and I feel like constantly bailing out my siblings won’t teach them to be more responsible. I’m not rolling in cash either — I’m still working hard to build my own life and future.

Now, my siblings have been telling our extended family that I’m greedy and heartless for not sharing more of the inheritance, and a lot of them agree. I’m feeling a lot of guilt, but I’m also frustrated because I don’t think it’s fair that I’m expected to keep rescuing them.

We started discussing dates and found a weekend that kind of works for the both of us.

I have a few logistical issues with this: I don't feel comfortable leaving a van with literally all of my belongings in some street for several hours while I'm at a stadium, and since the drive is so long we'd arrive in the new city late at night (probably around midnight) so I'd probably struggle to find people to help us unload the van.

82,1fgj09e,AITAH for telling a girl to stop pretending to have something she doesn’t?,"I (23F) have ADHD and struggle daily with starting work, eating, and sleeping. I’m unmedicated due to long wait times for consultations. One of my friends has a gf, Eva (23), who claims she has ADHD after she watched TikToks, even though she’s got no diagnosis (already has depression and anxiety). Her GP said she barely met the referral score for ADHD (55%).

Eva started making exaggerated claims after the COVID lockdowns, claiming being excited to see people and procrastination was ADHD. At first, I ignored it as it’s common for people to misuse mental health terms, but it became frustrating when she began talking about wanting medication and the lack of ADHD support in our country (she moved here for college). I offered her resources that helped me manage ADHD, but she dismissed me, saying I wasn’t “really” ADHD because my “life was in order,” even though she only sees me in social settings.

Eva constantly posts ADHD memes in our group chat, which no one reacts to. Friends have told me they’re tired of her constant ADHD claims. And when I mention my struggles, like poor sleep, in a social setting she’s condescending, telling me to “just get off my phone at bed time”. Her dismissive attitude towards my experience with ADHD feels hurtful, especially since I’ve dealt with it my whole life.

Eva’s boyfriend (Dave) is oblivious, and when my boyfriend tried to talk to him about her behavior, Dave said I was overreacting.

Last night, after yet another ADHD sob story, I called her out in the group chat, telling her to stop pretending and seek a proper diagnosis if she thinks she needs it and I told her her attention-seeking behavior was hurtful. Some people said in the gc I was wrong, but I received dms from them thanking me.

AITAH?

I’ve fought since I was 7 for my ADHD to be taken seriously, and if Eva weren’t so rude, I might’ve let it go and stayed quiet. Eva has called me an AH over it all but I think I’m in the right.

---

Comments she’s made at me that didn’t fit the main story:

“OMG you’re so fucked in the head for not having the ability to do your work on time” 

“Fuck sake why don’t you just start your work earlier? You’re so fucked up for not having your life together” 

“You could do with skipping a few meals anyway so it’s not a big deal that you haven’t been really eating recently”

***EDIT***

Her claims of ADHD came after a friend got an autism diagnosis and Eva said she was “the last girl in the group without a cool diagnosis”.

When she initially thought she had adhd I gave her resources to help and offered support.  She was doing things like running round the living room like a dog with zoomies and saying “omg I’m so adhd”.  Another one that she’s does is interrupt people while they are talking and saying “it’s my adhd i can’t help it”.  I understand that I am not a professional but she refused a diagnosis from the appropriate places after her gp said the screening questions overlap a lot with anxiety and depression symptoms. She tells me things like “that’s not an adhd thing I’d know because I have adhd”.

One of my friends has a gf, Eva (23), who claims she has ADHD after she watched TikToks, even though she’s got no diagnosis (already has depression and anxiety). Her GP said she barely met the referral score for ADHD (55%).

Eva started making exaggerated claims after the COVID lockdowns, claiming being excited to see people and procrastination was ADHD. At first, I ignored it as it’s common for people to misuse mental health terms, but it became frustrating when she began talking about wanting medication and the lack of ADHD support in our country (she moved here for college). I offered her resources that helped me manage ADHD, but she dismissed me, saying I wasn’t “really” ADHD because my “life was in order,” even though she only sees me in social settings.

Eva constantly posts ADHD memes in our group chat, which no one reacts to. Friends have told me they’re tired of her constant ADHD claims. And when I mention my struggles, like poor sleep, in a social setting she’s condescending, telling me to “just get off my phone at bed time”. Her dismissive attitude towards my experience with ADHD feels hurtful, especially since I’ve dealt with it my whole life.

Eva’s boyfriend (Dave) is oblivious, and when my boyfriend tried to talk to him about her behavior, Dave said I was overreacting.

Last night, after yet another ADHD sob story, I called her out in the group chat, telling her to stop pretending and seek a proper diagnosis if she thinks she needs it and I told her her attention-seeking behavior was hurtful. Some people said in the gc I was wrong, but I received dms from them thanking me.

AITAH?

I’ve fought since I was 7 for my ADHD to be taken seriously, and if Eva weren’t so rude, I might’ve let it go and stayed quiet. Eva has called me an AH over it all but I think I’m in the right.

---

Comments she’s made at me that didn’t fit the main story:

“OMG you’re so fucked in the head for not having the ability to do your work on time” 

“Fuck sake why don’t you just start your work earlier? You’re so fucked up for not having your life together” 

“You could do with skipping a few meals anyway so it’s not a big deal that you haven’t been really eating recently”

***EDIT***

Her claims of ADHD came after a friend got an autism diagnosis and Eva said she was “the last girl in the group without a cool diagnosis”.

When she initially thought she had adhd I gave her resources to help and offered support.  She was doing things like running round the living room like a dog with zoomies and saying “omg I’m so adhd”.  Another one that she’s does is interrupt people while they are talking and saying “it’s my adhd i can’t help it”.  I understand that I am not a professional but she refused a diagnosis from the appropriate places after her gp said the screening questions overlap a lot with anxiety and depression symptoms. She tells me things like “that’s not an adhd thing I’d know because I have adhd”.  I was at my whits end.",0.0,0.004806303419172764,0,1

He has a, I'd say, inconsistently physically demanding job but also loves to skate. So of course any injury is ""I'll walk it off"". He just told me how he almost tripped and fell in this morning because his leg nearly gave out from beneath him. Not the first time this has happened. I asked him to please see a doctor, also not the first time. I was hoping for it to be a good day where he can handle me asking this, but it wasn't. He became super defensive, asked me not to bother him with this and that ""He's not demand me to do things I don't want to do"". He brought up how my craft room is still a mess and how he doesn't remind me all the time to clean it so I could paint and went to doom scroll angrily on his computer. I told him I don't think this compares to a health problem and that pleading doesn't equal demanding and that he keeps telling me he'll do it's for months so clearly he isn't. He answered with it being comparable as a mental health thing and I lost my cool and snapped that that's also something he's not taking care of.

He shut down, said he doesn't want to do anything today anymore and went to bed. I feel ultra shitty for snapping like that, he has other health problems as well that he keeps bringing up but doesn't get checked or solved and it's a near constant. He says it's not my problem and he can just shut up about mentioning them. ""Good days"" are few and far between and I've tried to numb myself from how worried I am about his health but I just don't know anymore, it's slowly turning into resentment. Clearly he has problems getting in contact with a doctor, otherwise he would've done it, but he refuses help and doesn't hear how his inaction affects me. I feel like ITA because bringing it up while he's in pain must be annoying and I can't seem to change the way I feel and act about it when he mentions it.

Last night we watched old skate videos and I loved how he lit up from it. We often go skating together and it's one of my favourite things. Watching the videos made me hopeful that maybe the joy will beat the fear and anxiety he feels from emailing his doctor. But I guess not.

My husband is ill right now and I have the thought to do nothing for him.
For context: he is a nasty sob when he is sick or injured.
He had a hernia surgery a few years ago that was open cut not laporascopic so he had a 6 to 8 week healing period.
I did everything I could for him, without complaint as that's what partners do, and he was nasty to me the whole time. Insulting me, making comments about the food I brought him, blowing up trivial matters, just in general being nasty.
Ive taken care of him through multiple bouts of covid. He's been mean and nasty every time, as if I'm the reason he's sick.
When I am sick I can barely get a glass of water out of him. When I gave birth to our child, he made it about him and his stresses and screamed at me the night we brought her home over something trivial.
When I almost died from a septic gallbladder, spent a week in hospital, lost my gallbladder, and came home to our 5 week old baby, he screamed at me again over something trivial. I did not get to rest and heal, I had to clean our house, bathe our cat, feed myself, and care for my 5 week old.
Today was my last straw.
He came home from a midnight shift sick as a dog and went straight to bed. I brought him tea, water, meds, his laptop,  anything he asked and he's been asleep for almost 24 hours.

I finished up, picked her up and went to head downstairs saying to her ""its ok honey please stop crying we are going to get breakfast""
and he yells ""can you both shut the f**k up""
I have cptsd and being told to shut up is a huge trigger for me, which he knows.
I said nothing, brought my daughter downstairs, fed, changed, and soothed her.
She is now happily watching ms rachel while I make coffee.

87,1fghypf,AITA- Am I the bad roommate?,"# 

Hi, I’m in my 20s and don’t throw parties—just work, college, and gaming. I live with my best friend Mary, and we got a new roommate, Jessica, late last year. My first meeting with Jessica was awkward. At a New Year’s house party Mary organized, my close friend tried to be friendly with Jessica by asking where she lived, but Jessica responded with passive-aggressive remarks, making things uncomfortable for us.

Jessica moved in, and I chose not to mention it to Mary, giving Jessica the benefit of the doubt—maybe she was nervous or having a bad day. I game at night and admit I was loud at times, but Mary never complained. Instead of addressing me directly, Jessica complained to the landlord, which surprised and frustrated me. I apologized and suggested she message me if noise was an issue. She also said she could hear me talking with my boyfriend. I tried to be considerate by getting new headphones with one ear uncovered and no noise cancellation and by lowering my voice and avoiding loud games.  I ensured to be quiet by 9 or 10 PM.

Despite these efforts, Jessica complained again, saying my phone was too loud, even though I kept it at the lowest volume. Now, I watch Instagram videos without sound. Her room isn’t directly below mine; the spare room is. I use a fan for white noise because of my insomnia, which helps me sleep and is louder than my speaking. I’ve also adjusted all my volume settings. I don’t game loudly except on Friday nights, when I’m less mindful but still try to be quiet. Our neighbors play loud music, which is much louder than my quiet gaming or talking.

One night, while gaming quietly with minimal talking, I accidentally coughed after drinking water. Jessica messaged me passive-aggressively, saying I was too loud. Recently, Mary asked if I had a machine running at night and I mentioned my fan. Mary said Jessica couldn’t sleep because it was too loud. I’m frustrated. I’ve tried hard to accommodate Jessica—buying new headphones, changing my habits, and keeping volumes low. Yet, she is loud, leaves dirty dishes, and leaves skid marks in the toilet. She even took my shelf space in the cupboard without asking.

I feel like I’m being excessively scrutinized despite my efforts. My anxiety and depression have worsened with Jessica openly complaining about me to her boyfriend and friends. I feel like I can’t win, as even my attempts to combat insomnia outside the house though exercise are met with complaints (opening the door is too loud).

I haven’t discussed this with Mary since she’s close friends with Jessica. I’m unsure if I’m being unreasonable or if Jessica’s demands are too much. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks for reading. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITA- Am I the bad roommate? #

""second wife"". For some background, my dad is very manipulative. He wasn't always like that though, he came from a really financially unstable background and his family was really poor. He then moved to the city we live in now for university, he excelled and now he's pretty well off- like well off enough to have a collection of cars. when he started to get his money up he became more manipulative and egotistical, if i opposed him he would threaten me with something (for example we had a fight and he threatened to pull me out of school because he felt like i was ungrateful). Anyways, my dad left his affair partner Tammy after the divorce because ""she didn't know how to act right"". 2 years later he began dating his now girlfriend Tiana .

So my 18F parents got divorced in 2020 because my dad cheated on my mom and said he wanted a
""second wife"". For some background, my dad is very manipulative. He wasn't always like that though, he came from a really financially unstable background and his family was really poor. He then moved to the city we live in now for university, he excelled and now he's pretty well off- like well off enough to have a collection of cars. when he started to get his money up he became more manipulative and egotistical, if i opposed him he would threaten me with something (for example we had a fight and he threatened to pull me out of school because he felt like i was ungrateful).

91,1fggfmk,AITAH for expecting my husband to help me with canning after work? ,"To keep it short, It's canning season so I've been trying to can what I can lately. This was my last canning session and I've done all of them by myself thus far. Pickles, 3 different types of jam, salsa and now I did tomato sauce. 

I haven't done tomato sauce in about 2 years so I did not realize that it would take me over 12 hours to make and can 😵‍💫. So I was only done with the whole process of making the sauce when my husband got home and I still had to clean, make dinner and finish the actual canning process. 

My husband was not happy and grumbled a few times that he told me so that I would be staying up canning and I just brushed the comments off at first. He also was not happy that dinner was not ready. He kept bringing the kids to me and was saying that they're tired and that they're hungry. I had to snap at him to get out of the kitchen to which he ushered them out saying that ""mamas in a bad mood"". 

This was only 6:30pm, mind you. Usually we eat dinner between 630 to 7 so it's not like I'm behind schedule. I served food right at 7 and continued cleaning. I was hoping that he could put down the baby while I was finishing up but the baby kept crying wanting me so I had to go put the baby down. My husband kicked his feet up after that and didn't help with a thing after that. 

He layed in bed for about an hour before checking up on me in the kitchen and criticizing everything. It really hurt that he was making comments basically that I'm just wasting my time. He said goodnight to me and then was going to sleep but I asked him why he couldn't help me instead of laying around so we could have watched a show or talk while I'm waiting for the cans to pressurize. He got upset and called me an AH for expecting him to help after a long day at work. We went back and forth for a bit until he just went to bed.

He works a 8-5 office job and I work the next day starting at 7am. So I had to finish canning by myself at 12am to wake up at 5:30am. He slept in because it's his day off and I'm just so upset even now when I just woke up. He has never helped me with canning, I always  do everything myself. 

AITAH for expecting him to help me? Or am I just being tired and grumpy 🥲. I actually genuinely would like advice if its too much to ask. (Also sorry for the mistakes, English isn't my first language.)

I forgot to mention that I find canning necessary because our grocery budget is $500 a month right now and I got 2 big boxes of tomatoes FOR FREE!! so I was super excited to make 40 cans of tomatoe sauce for essentially the price of 1! 😊",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITAH for expecting my husband to help me with canning after work?

93,1fgft3a,AITA for not making enough of an effort to change my vocabulary after my wife asked me to.,"I (50M) have a wife (50F) and 2 daughters (15F and 17F). I have always never had a filter and say what I think and this can lead to my vocabulary being a little harsh and abrupt.

About a year ago my wife started getting into feminist stuff because our daughters are nearing adulthood and started to take issue with my vocabulary and asked me to change it.

I don't see it as such a big deal but I agreed to try to make her happy.

I genuinely try to not intentionally say things she doesn't like and I stopped with the jokes she doesn't like. However it is who I am and how i have spoken all my life so it won't just go away.

Yesterday I she got upset at me and told me that I'm not making enough of an effort and called me an AH because of 2 minor things I said.

I was driving and on speaker phone with one of my buddies while she was in the car with me and this girl in front of me was blocking everyone by taking forever to back into a spot and I said ""some dumb girl in front of me can't drive for shit"". She didn't say anything but brought it up later when the got upset at the next thing. Literally so many people say that phrase when a woman on the younger side is being dumb. A lot of my friends do.

Then later at dinner I was talking about work and was talking about a conflict between two sets of managers on a different team and some hr recruiters and said they were ""acting like high school girls"" which is an expression people use cause it's just normal for teen girls to be going through that phase. It's an expression and doesn't mean I think it is universally true.

But she got angry and told me that it is wrong because we have daughters (even though they literally are in the typical teen girl irrational phase).

AITA here? I feel like she can't expect me to change overnight and I've been filtering myself a lot already to the best I can.

95,1fgfna0,AITA for lashing out on my friend for calling me stupid? ,"For context, we are both female and in high school. I won't say our specific ages for obvious reasons. 

Anyways, a few days ago, we were helping set up some stages for an event that was going on in the gym. We had to screw in the legs at the corners of the stage platforms. I screwed a few on, but one of them wouldn't budge. I tried screwing it in both ways but it still wouldn't stay in. You get the idea. I called one of our other friends to help me and she tried, but then my other friend (the girl who I lashed out on) came over and the conversation went something like this:

Me: ""No, it won't go in, I've tried screwing it both ways.""

Her: ""Are you stupid? Use your brain for once. You're just screwing it in wrong. You're literally so dumb oh my god.""

Yeah and anyways I felt really angry about that, since I consider myself a good student who aspires to get good grades. I want to go to medical school. I have a good GPA. I've been called stupid all my life and I've spent all my life trying to prove that I'm not, so of course this made me mad. I definitely have some anger stuff I need to work on, as I lash out on people sometimes whenever I feel insulted, which is exactly what I did here. I told her to fix her spine before talking (for context, she has scoliosis) and she told me to fix my height (I'm short). I brushed it off afterwards but it still felt weird and I was still hurt. I think I overreacted. 

For more context, she does this all the time. If I'm doing something wrong she'll call me stupid or dumb and I always thought of it as a joke but this particular scenario pissed me off the most. She makes me feel like shit, so I don't usually rely on her for help with things like these. I guess I'm afraid of being called stupid. Whenever I feel embarrassed or stressed I always lash out on people, and this happened AGAIN the next day.

We were talking at lunch and our other friend (the one I had originally called on to help me) brought up the situation and made a few small jokes about it, so I thought we were cool about it now. But the other girl started saying things like ""Oh haha you were so mean to me yesterday"" and I got confused because she originally insulted me first and she knows how I handle being called stupid.

To start off me and my wife have been together for a little over 4 years now. We have had rocky times but we have been happy together for the most part. We have a 1 and 1/2 year old who is our love and joy. Well she got a job and one of her coworkers we will call Beth became very good friends. So she would go after work to her house and whatnot and leave me to take care of our son. That is okay until it became an every week routine 2-3 times a week. So I had some problems with it due to the fact that I was being forced to stay home by myself and our kid. While this was all going on she proceeds to tell me that I’m an asshole for not letting her do her own thing and that I’m basically a terrible partner. So I’m having a mental breakdown and got very very depressed. I couldn’t tell my feelings without her just being cold and distant and not caring. I at one point go through her phone and see a message between her and Beth. Where my wife says she wish she could have saved the messages where they told each other how they felt about each other. I confronted her about it and she told apologized and said it wasn’t that big of a deal and that it was just situational. She said it was because we were having issues and Beth had just gotten out of a relationship. The feelings I was told were temporary. So I was even more depressed after all that. I told her that she should not go to her house anymore after work until she stops feeling that way, I had set a boundary there. Not only a couple days later she asks if she can go there and I say no it hasn’t even been a week. Then an argument broke out and again I’m called controlling and whatnot. So she gets her way again. Now flash forward 2-3 months and she has stayed the night there the past 2 weekends and I really am uncomfortable with the fact that she is staying the night there.

97,1fgf461,AITAH? Would you do this too?,"I (18M) have been dating my gf (19F) for 6 months. Recently we got into an argument and I asked her for more appreciation. One of the points I brought up was a tire situation we had 4 months into our relationship. We were in the car one day she was driving and she was looking at her phone and swerved off the road which resulted in her tire popping. She didn’t know  how to change a tire (not that I would make her do it anyway) so I did it for her as well as later offered to buy her a new tire and take her car while she was a work to a tire repair place to have it changed. When the day arrived I texted her I was 30 mins away from her work and she knew it was for the tire. When I walked in there she was working so I got her purse and got the keys out. I have gone into her purse for other things before and it has never been an issue. We also had other things that I find more personal like each other’s phone passwords and locations. I also clearly communicated that I was coming and when I’d be there. She watched me remove the keys and take them and walk over to where she was, when she finished, the first thing she said was you could’ve asked before grabbing them. I brought up the above points and said I was sorry, only to be met with more attitude and no appreciation. The part that really bothered me was the fact she didn’t even say “hi” or “I love you” or “thank you”.

B. Am I crazy for asking for more appreciation?
C. AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-14,"AITAH? Would you do this too? I (18M) have been dating my gf (19F) for 6 months. Recently we got into an argument and I asked her for more appreciation. One of the points I brought up was a tire situation we had 4 months into our relationship. We were in the car one day she was driving and she was looking at her phone and swerved off the road which resulted in her tire popping. She didn’t know  how to change a tire (not that I would make her do it anyway) so I did it for her as well as later offered to buy her a new tire and take her car while she was a work to a tire repair place to have it changed. When the day arrived I texted her I was 30 mins away from her work and she knew it was for the tire. When I walked in there she was working so I got her purse and got the keys out. I have gone into her purse for other things before and it has never been an issue. We also had other things that I find more personal like each other’s phone passwords and locations. I also clearly communicated that I was coming and when I’d be there. She watched me remove the keys and take them and walk over to where she was, when she finished, the first thing she said was you could’ve asked before grabbing them. I brought up the above points and said I was sorry, only to be met with more attitude and no appreciation. The part that really bothered me was the fact she didn’t even say “hi” or “I love you” or “thank you”. So long story short I handed her back her keys and walked out, for pure respect for myself, and I did end up talking to her about it later but did not buy the tire.

When I brought it up to my husband, he validated my feelings but ultimately told me that it's a group of guys who are comfortable with each other, and I can't expect them to change.

101,1fgds8m,WIBTA if I went on a cruise this Christmas instead of going to our family’s cabin?,"I recently went on a Labor Day camping trip with my family (two parents, three younger brothers, sister-in-law, and niece).  Unfortunately, the trip pretty much exemplified everything that drives me nuts about them: namely, that they disrespect me far too often, hold me to a different standard than they do themselves, and expect me not to get angry about it.

In particular, I have problems with my youngest brother, with whom I shared a tent and would share a bedroom in the cabin.  Though almost eight years my junior, he feels entitled to give me lectures about “taking social cues” (read: doing whatever he wants me to do without complaining) and order me to do as he thinks fit.  If he thinks I was out of line — and he *always* does in any situation in which I’m involved — he makes that clear no matter how many times I tell him I’m not interested in his opinion, even telling me to “shut up and listen” to what I “need to hear” and demanding that I apologize for my “poor behaviour.”  (This man is almost 30 and still lives with my parents.)

I am not allowed to get angry no matter how abusive he (or, less frequently, the others) get, or else my mother will start crying and lamenting that we can’t just get along.  For her part, she gets involved in disputes no matter how many times she’s asked to stay out of them, declaring complex matters “over and done with” and insisting on setting up apology meetings.

The last straw was when my mom, putting on her typical “not very happy” face, felt the need to chide me over breakfast for having had too much to drink and being “embarrassing” on my long weekend from work, despite the others’ reassurances that I’d done nothing inappropriate and her youngest’s being a literal alcoholic.

103,1fgdqip,WIBTA for talking to my FIL (my husband's dad)?,"Hi. This is going to be somewhat long but I need to know if I WBTA for this..

So my husband, Caleb, (28m) and his father/my FIL, Steve, have had a very rocky relationship. Growing up Steve left Caleb's mom (my MIL) when he was 5 years old as he was becoming an addict and was cheating. They had 4 kids together (2 daughters, my husband, & 1 other son). The youngest one (his brother) was 1 yrs old at the time. Anyways, his mom tried to make it work for about a year but officially requested a divorce and was granted majority of custody while his father got weekends. 

Steve never came and Caleb nor his siblings when it was his time. He was disappear for months, sometimes up to a year, so his mother (husband's grandma) took and watched them. Steve never paid any child support or anything either. So obviously this lead to some resentment and when my husband would finally see Steve he would ask him why doesn't he want him. FIL wouldn't give a response..

Fast forward 7 years ago, I met Caleb (21 then) and around that time he had a heart to heart with his father about how he felt Steve didn't love him and how he didn't respect him at all as a man. Steve told him to get over it and move on. (By this time his sisters somewhat forgave FIL as they say he did everything due to addiction and that it's a disease so he should get some grace. Caleb and BIL don't agree with that). After that my husband never mentioned it to him again but told me that he hated his father.

Now periodically, throughout the years Caleb would have a guys night and after drinking would come home sad, sometimes crying about wanting a relationship with his dad. I would always mention talking to a therapist, his ""uncle"" (cousin dad), or maybe going to have a convo with Steve again & that I would be there for him with whatever he decided. By the next day, Caleb was back to saying screw FIL. Though eventually he would start coming home sad after work. He was never open to therapy, didn't want to talk to his uncle, nor FIL. There were times where I would almost convince him to do one of them but he would end up bowing out.

Well now we have found out we are pregnant. I am 23 weeks and we are expecting a boy! This has been very exciting for me and Caleb but at the same time extremely difficult/sad for him as it makes him wish even more that he had a relationship with FIL. He still doesn't respect him but he wants Steve to want to have a relationship with him and put in the enough. My husband has tried 3 times since he was 14 to build a relationship and nothing has ever changed..

Now I know he would be irritated if I went to speak with Steve as he wants Steve to genuinely want a relationship with him. And honestly Im not even sure what I would say if I did go meet him... I spoken to his brother about my idea and he's not sure if it's the right move as he doesn't think anything will change and doesn't want his brother to get irritated with me. But it breaks my heart seeing Caleb cry and feel so unloved by someone that should be protecting and loving him..

Context - I am a brown man in a predominantly white neighbourhood (not necessarily saying this was racially motivated, but not ruling it out, I am open to comments, just want to include anything that may be pertinent) It was about a month ago that it first happened. There is a small chicken wire fenced dog park near my apartment that I cross regularly on my diurnal walks with my dog. My dog is a medium sized (~40lbs), 3 year old rescue who I have had since she was a pup. She has also been mistaken for a puppy many times in adulthood to give you an idea of her size/playful demeanour. She is a mutt and when she gets excited or scared her hackles stand up. She is friendly with most dogs her size or bigger but not so much with smaller dogs. 

One evening I was taking her out after a stressful day at work and there were 3 dogs in the park just lying around with their moms yapping. My dog went up close to the fence to say hi, tail on full helicopter wag, and these two dogs (both bigger than her) started barking their heads off, scaring mine and making her hackles stand up. She barked back and the lady owner snapped at me about how everyone has told her that my dog was an asshole and that I should keep her on a tight leash. I was pissed off but didn’t say anything and walked away. Since then I have consciously avoided this lady and her dogs any time I see them. I have also observed her dogs to be aggressive towards a few other dogs in the area and I have talked to the owners who echo my sentiments about this lady. I have also never seen her walk her dogs they are always just in the park laying around barking at any passerby or dog, while mom is having a jolly time talking to her friend.

This evening I had the misfortune of running into this lady and her dogs again, with no chance of circumventing. Her dogs started barking again and my dog retaliated but I had her on a tight leash so she got nowhere near the other two. I kept walking but this lady calls me out again and says “Keep walking.” Not sure why but that got under my skin. It’s been a stressful week and I was not looking to beef with someone unpleasant who I don’t even know. But I truly lost it in that moment and told her that she was the problem and that her dogs would be better behaved if she walked them more and spent less time sitting around yapping. She then proceeds to tell me that I should keep walking because she feels threatened and unsafe, that pissed me off more like how you gonna talk shit and act like the victim?? I told her to go fuck herself and that if it was my intention to threaten her she would know it. I have had time to cool off but I am wondering if I was the asshole because an outburst like that is uncharacteristic for me and I feel like I just unloaded on her because my head was not on right because of the work week.

105,1fgd6cn,WIBTA if I tell my bf he can't play a specific video game anymore?,"So me (25f) and my bf of 5+yrs (Zack, 26m) need an outside perspective.

Zack has been really into this game called Helldivers (typical 3ps game). Me and Zack both enjoy our fair share of video games, but I'm not a big fan of shooter style games, and don't even have a computer capable of running this specific game, so I have never played it and don't really want to.

The issue I have with this game is the commitment it requires. *Apparently*, according to Zack, you have to do at least 3 missions per session, AND, each mission is minimum 30 minutes, but usually closer to 45-60 minutes. So when he starts playing this game, he is committed for minimum1.5-2 hours, but usually longer. I keep trying to be ok with this, but really I'm not.

A bit of backstory, my dad growing up was basically addicted to an online game called World of Warcraft (WoW). He missed a lot of my extra curricular events and stopped helping with projects we started together because he'd rather play WoW. It kinda sucked, and I was very lonely growing up. I thought it was fine then, but now that I'm an adult and I see how much of my life my parents didn't bother to be involved in... It hurts to look back on. and I think a lot of it was because of that stupid game, WoW. 

So when Zack is playing Helldivers, I can't help but get upset. When he says he wants to go game, I just say goodnight, because it means he's gone for the rest of the night. We've talked about it multiple times, and can't come to an agreement. 

I wish Zack would completely drop this game and not play it at all when I'm home. But I know it's how he socializes and it's one of the few activities he can enjoy with friends who have moved out of state. I don't want to take that away from him. But when I suggest a limit for how much he can play a week, he says it's controlling, and he can't predict when everyone is going to be available so he wants to join when the group is all there, no matter when that may be. I want it to be limited to 1 day a week, and he has to tell me ahead of time, because to me he may as well be going out drinking with the boys, because he's pretty much unavailable. He says he's perfectly available if I just join the Discord call, which I've tried once before, but I was still missing out on most of what they were talking about since I'm not playing the game. I really don't want to be that controlling gf that tells her bf what video games he's allowed to play, but this one just doesn't seem compatible with having an active relationship. I know at least 2 of my friends who are having the same dilemma, one of which has a KID that is being ignored for this game... It hurts my heart. 

Zack says I'm holding a grudge against WoW, and he's not my father, but idk, this feels just as bad as it did when I was a kid. Am I being too emotional over this? WIBTA if I tell him I'm straight up not ok with him playing this game without explicit restrictions?


Edit: thanks to everyone who provided thoughtful input and advice! I think I really needed the reality check, and I am being a bit overemotional about this. I have been suggesting doing a couples therapy session together for a while now but I think I'm going to push the idea a bit more and try to make it happen cuz evidently I'm projecting my past issues and I think having a mediated discussion would really help. Other than that I'm sure we'll be able to come to a compromise over this and some of you have given some good ideas so I'll take those into account.

Zack has been really into this game called Helldivers (typical 3ps game). Me and Zack both enjoy our fair share of video games, but I'm not a big fan of shooter style games, and don't even have a computer capable of running this specific game, so I have never played it and don't really want to.

So she eventually said she didn’t have money and used it (we did home renovations last year so she said she used it for some of that and to pay other bills).

She's always wearing really high heels and I've always been concerned about how she drives in them. Despite me advising against it she says she can't be bothered about it and can drive in them just fine. She drives in all kinds of heels including stilettos.

The other day she got into an accident and rear ended someone. It was a fender bender and no one was hurt or anything and I feel like she could have braked sooner based on the dashcam footage.

The other driver switched lanes in front of her and then traffic stopped and she rear ended him. I felt there was a good chance this could have ended up getting considered her fault but the insurance company ruled in her favor luckily and said she was cut off. Regardless I feel it was avoidable. 

After the incident i again told her she should stop driving in heels and she got upset at me and said I was blaming her for no reason and asked me if I have some other issue with her wearing heels and looking good.

She had rear ended someone about 2 years ago as well which was clearly her fault but the other driver let it go as it was just a scuff.

When we got home I went upstairs to put the kids to bed I found out the the kids rooms were different colors from when I left.  I asked my husband about it and he was smiling and saying the rooms were always those colors and that I must have been misremembering but the kids ratted him out and said that he had painted their rooms.  He then showed me our bedroom and oh my gosh was it ... green.  I know I had once told my husband that I wanted the room dark green but this was like forest green.  My husband also has a habit of just doing things around the house like getting a ping pong table without my say and we've had arguments before about how I'm not included in his decision making. Anyway, I did not react in the way my husband expected.  I wasn't outright mad ... just not happy. 

After the kids went down and he was putting the bedroom back together I came in to talk to him about why I wasn't included in this decision and he told me that he was upset at my reaction, that I didn't appreciate the time and work it took to paint the rooms over the week, that I had not yet said thank you, and that he needed some time to cool off. 

Later on he came downstairs after he had put everything back together and said that I was welcome to repaint the room.  When I tried to talk to him about including me in these decisions he stopped me and said that's not how surprises work, and said that this was a hill I shouldn't be fighting over.  I felt like he basically invalidated me because he wanted to ""surprise"" me.  I said I just wanted to come home to him and the kids and instead spent the night crying because I upset him.  He said he was sorry for how I felt but did so in a way that meant that he didn't care and wanted the conversation to be over.  He then went to his office to play on the computer.

118,1fgc0kj,AITA for asking family to smoke outside?,"Are we the assholes for wanting to ask my husband’s family to go outside to smoke? My husband (28M) and I (27F) have been invited to his Aunt and Uncles house for Thanksgiving this year, along with my Father-in-Law’s (FIL) immediate family. The uncle is FIL’s brother, to help connect things. 

My husband’s parents are divorced so the holidays consist of mostly stress, running around to everyone’s celebration and, without a doubt, someone being upset they didn’t get, “enough time”. Add that to now having our first child (16mo) that everyone wants to see and celebrate with and we’ve got ourselves a pretty large shit show. 

That being said, we’ve been invited to go to his Uncle’s for Thanksgiving this year and they live out of state. This eliminates the requirement of running around, which my husband really hates, so that alone makes him want to go. However, his Aunt and Uncle smoke cigarettes in their house. We went for Thanksgiving two years ago, while I was pregnant, and they were smoking while sitting right next to me. To those who may be thinking “maybe they didn’t know”, we told them in September when we found out and I was almost 20 weeks and showing at Thanksgiving. So they knew. 

Anyway, we’ve previously mentioned the smoking to FIL, who has been the one communicating between us and the Uncle, and he said that they, “wouldn’t smoke around” said child. For those who know, and maybe those that don’t, being in a different room doesn’t negate being affected by the smoke. It makes everything smell like cigarettes, you can still be inhaling it, I personally get heinous migraines from it and it’s linked to several illnesses in children. So it’s not great and we don’t want to put our child in that kind of environment, but my husband doesn’t feel like we can ask them to smoke outside. He says it will, “cause an issue” and that it’s “disrespectful” to ask them to change how they operate in their own home.

119,1fgbzgs,AITA for not putting my partner on the deed of my house?,"I've been with my partner for 19 years. We have two kids together. We're unmarried. 

I had a really crap childhood. Foreclosures, evictions, divorces, psycho step dads and a strung out mom. Ever since I was a little kid, literally age 8 or so, I dreamed of owning a house free and clear so I'd never have to experience that hell again. My partner had a lousy childhood too, though not like horror story level dysfunctional like mine. After graduation she was buried in debt and her degree didn't make her very employable. That's around when we met. She didn't think much, or at all, about real estate.

By the time I was 25 I had bought two houses. I promptly lost them both in the 2008 market crash. Then, in 2011 there was an unprecedented opportunity. I cashed out my 60,000 dollar 401k retirement account and paid cash for an absolute dump in downtown. I spent all the money from my retirement account to buy the house and fix it up. When I ran out of money, I borrowed more (debt I still have). Remodeling the house wasn't easy. My partner was with me through all of this. She labored and worked. It was always my money though.

When the house was finished and we'd been living there a few years, she got pregnant with our first kid. I stayed home to watch him during the day and worked at night. Then the second kid came. So, for 9 years I took care of the kids all day and worked in restaurants at night. *We always split the household expenses 50/50, despite her making 3x as much money as me.* She would just give me money (between 600-1000 dollars monthly) and I would pay everything (car, insurance, phone, utilities, etc.). 

Well, a little over a year ago she started feeling ""dissatisfied"" with our relationship. We separated, but not really. She's renting a house from a friend and we're still spending a few nights a week together. We still have family time with the kids. It's mostly the same as it's always been.

Over the last 6 months we've been doing therapy. She's got so many resentments and so many are super valid, but the only issue I can't see her way on is that she feels like she should own half the house. I just can't see how that's fair to me. I paid cash for it 13 years ago, before we had kids. I never exploited the situation. I never charged her ""rent"". It was never an issue and she never mentioned wanting to be part owner of the house. 

I really wanna reconcile with her and I love her very much. It's just that I have no support network. No family to turn to (she does). I have no retirement savings (she does). My house is worth rock bottom for a decent 3/2 in my city. I have a 7 and a 9 year old who need me. The only stability in my life comes from owning my home. I can't risk putting her on the deed and having her leave again. AITA for not wanting to put her on the deed?

EDIT - I have been criticized for not disclosing that her and I make roughly the same money now. I've been making ok money for the last two years, or so. My two year anniversary at my job was in August. I don't see how it changes the balance sheet because I still paid cash for the house 13 years ago by cashing out my retirement account. From 2014 to 2022 she was making 60k per year and I was making 20k. Since 2011 we've paid no rent, and we both benefited equally from our low overhead.

Everyone seemed relatively friendly and I was happy to make new friends with like minded interests. I met a girl on there that was my age who liked a lot of the same things as me. We really hit it off and got along quite well. She later told me that there would be a in person meeting, so we decided to go together. 

A couple of days before the meeting she messaged me to ask if her roommate could come with us, and of course I said absolutely! 

The day of I found them at the meeting spot and both looked unamused. I brushed it off and started trying to make conversation but I got minimal responses back, almost nothing from the roommate whatsoever. As we went inside there was quite a few stairs we had to wait in due to a large turn out. They both continued standing on the same step as one another backs to me. My friend glanced back at me a couple times but never tried to include me in the conversation. But I didn’t want to give up and still tried to converse with the two but got almost no effort in return. They continued to block me out and talk to one another. While I was just uncomfortable being in their shadow.

We finally got in and sat down (the seating order was my friend, roommate, and then me. Of course the person who most likely disliked me was right next to me. The rest of the time the never tried to talk or include me once. And at that point after all the pushed off attempts I gave up trying at all. I was really hurt and sad and just wanted to leave. 

So when the group ice breakers began I was pretending to look through my bag for something. Of course they didn’t wait for me and just left together. Which was just another sign for me to leave. So I grabbed my bag and quickly made my way out.

By that point I was holding back tears. And thankfully I had a class in that building before so I knew a stairwell that no one ever went in. I just sat there and cried trying to let out my emotions. Since I didn’t want to look like too much of a wreck when walking back to my car. Thank goodness it was cloudy, East Coast doing me some favors!

I finally dried the tears and walked back to my car but as soon as I got in I broke down. I know it might seem silly but it made me really sad. 

I later told my friend about this and he said I was a bit of an asshole for leaving without telling them. So I’m not really sure anymore.

We finally got in and sat down (the seating order was my friend, roommate, and then me. Of course the person who most likely disliked me was right next to me. The rest of the time the never tried to talk or include me once. And at that point after all the pushed off attempts I gave up trying at all. I was really hurt and sad and just wanted to leave. 

So when the group ice breakers began I was pretending to look through my bag for something. Of course they didn’t wait for me and just left together. Which was just another sign for me to leave. So I grabbed my bag and quickly made my way out.

By that point I was holding back tears. And thankfully I had a class in that building before so I knew a stairwell that no one ever went in. I just sat there and cried trying to let out my emotions. Since I didn’t want to look like too much of a wreck when walking back to my car. Thank goodness it was cloudy, East Coast doing me some favors!

I finally dried the tears and walked back to my car but as soon as I got in I broke down. I know it might seem silly but it made me really sad. 

I later told my friend about this and he said I was a bit of an asshole for leaving without telling them. So I’m not really sure anymore.

Neither of my parents speak actual English. Broken, yes, but not enough to really understand without translation. My mom’s better than my dad, but they’re both not the greatest. They both immigrated to the US over 20 years ago.

It makes me so irritated that they neither speak nor understand English too well, and it gets in the way of everything. I can’t hang out with my friends sometimes, I can’t participate in certain things because they’re so disconnected from everyone and everything which sucks, especially in my town where everyone knows everyone. And what I can do in the activities I *do* participate in are limited because my parents can’t be there. They always rely on my older sister and I for translations but even then they didn’t bother properly teaching us Spanish so my older sister and I are pretty proficient but my younger siblings can’t string up a full sentence. Genuinely, if you’re not going to bother learning the main language you’re living in, at least teach us yours? Not to mention my mom specifically always says she wants to go back, which I get, but doesn’t that mean you’d *really* want us to know Spanish if not English at the very least?

124,1fgbcwv,AITA Picking a sliding scale price a practitioner wasn’t happy with,"I used to work in the healing arts. I booked a last minute energy work session with an acquaintance I’ve crossed paths with in our community, but not worked with. 

I asked him the price of his work before we started working together. He didn’t answer. I made an assumption—mistakenly—that he could tell I was in a dark spot and was stepping in to help out. 

At the end of the session, after completing work, he sent a message with his email and a zelle link. He didn’t say what to pay. I asked how much people paid. He said that it was by donation. I asked how much people usually donated. He said $400. This caught me off guard.

I have less than $1.2k in my bank account. That money needs towards housing, food, and gas this month. I don’t know where I’m living this month. 

I’m an unemployed, deeply traumatized autistic adult having a rock bottom. My grandparents left me a chunk of money, although to access those savings, I legally have to go through one of my parents (*I’m in my late 30s). It’s enough to keep me alive for now but it certainly isn’t enough to last a lifetime. That savings account is my lifeline.

After the session, I paid $223. It’s MUCH more than I would’ve paid if he was transparent about his pricing beforehand. I wouldn’t have booked a $400 session. He emailed to ask if I could get my mother’s approval to dip into the savings account to pay the rest.

From where I was sitting: it was really bizarre to me to have someone pull a bait and switch with their pricing like that. It isn’t common practice in the healing arts / therapy / etc field to surprise someone with a $400 bill. It also isn’t normal to say you do sliding scale and challenge what someone donates. It felt like he violated practitioner trust by inserting his opinions into my finances.

It’s triggering enough that I felt validated being upset… yet upon reflection, I’m trying to consider other points of view. It was certainly naive to think someone would help for free (although tbh, it does happen regularly enough in the healing arts / energy work / etc spaces to comp or subsidize sessions that my flawed expectation didn’t come out of nowhere.) 

Anyways.

We're both in college full time. Long before I started college, I explained to him that being a full time student in accelerated classes and working would not be something I could handle. He told me he was fine with that. 

He picked up a work study at his (non accelerated) college that is 25 hours a week at minimum wage. He is a veteran receiving funds for college, housing and disability. I have Medicaid and foodstamps. For the last year and a half we've had several arguments about ""partnership"". I clean the house, care for the animals, do the grocery shopping, manage the bills and take care of laundry (we have to go offsite for it, every two weeks I do it religiously), on top of my class work.

The only thing I ask him to do related to the house is cook dinner, and usually breakfast on the weekends. 

He claims that becuase he works and goes to college, he is exempt from housework (cooking included). 

My reasoning is that I do EVERYTHING household related, and that it's absolutely fair of me to ask him to cook hours after he's home (he gets home between 2-4pm and we normally eat dinner between 7-9pm), because he lives here and therefore contributes to the mess/food consumption.

But I guess this made my mom resent me, I look JUST like my dad and at times I act like him, so my mom has always neglected me emotionally and treats me as if I'm a maid. 

My sister on the other hand, looks just like like my mother and favors her over my dad, which is fine, but it made my mom favorite her. 

So my sister is extremely spoiled, she can get away with murder if she wanted to, and because of this, my sister has a tendency to be rude to me. 

She's blamed me for her messes, purposely making messes for me to clean, taking and using my things, I know this is normal siblings things, but it honestly pisses me off that my mom does absolutely nothing (my dad is usually off working and is too tired to deal my sis) 

For a long time, when I tell my sister ""no""ort try to xplain something to her she can't understand, or expose her for doing something, she would scream, get mad, and then hit me

It's not that it hurt.. But I'm getting really tired of it. Recently  My lil sister used my nail polish and didn't even closeith the right way, I confronted her about it, and she proceeded to say ""I don't care"" or ""not my problem"" and "" I couldn't find mine"" and when I said that her losing her nail polish isn't MY problem shes hit me repeatedly, and I hit her back, and screamed at her: ""Your a bully, is that why the kids at school don't like you? because your a bully?"" my sister had issues at school with other kids,who just didn't like her, and I never really knew the whole story, but  I talked to one of the kids and they complained about my sister taking the kids things. 

anyway she started to cry and ran to go tell mom, my mom called me the bully, and the brat.. And my other family says I shouldn't have said that so AITA?

133,1fg9my1,AITA for talking badly about a frenemy that’s my coworker and in my friend group? I feel so guilty! Help,"Here’s some context. I have a group of friends who were initially my boyfriend’s best friends (there’s 6 of us.) But my boyfriend has always been really bothered by this girl, we’ll refer to her as Tia. I met Tia before I met my boyfriend about 3-4 years ago at work and we hit it off. I left that job and now Tia and I are working together again. 
She’s not a bad person. She’s fun, she’s generous and usually nice and easy to have a conversation with. She’s done many nice things for me. She’s spoiled me with gifts and been there for me through some tough times. And I honestly am not sure if she means to be the way she is. She’s a very likable person usually. But she’s also controlling, pushy, and bossy. Especially about hanging out/what we’re doing and when. Trying to control what everyone does to her liking with many different things. She can be very blunt and rude at times. Shes embarrassed/ called me out in front of my boss twice (which felt a little intentional both times.) And once saying something embarrassing about something that should’ve been personal in front of a group of people when she was drunk. (Also felt a little intentional) She ripped me off in a cosmetic trade, and when I confronted her about it, though she did refund me and apologize. She said she forgot the amount. When I got way less done in the appointment than I planned and then asked her what the total was at the end. So I’m not sure how she could just forget? Especially when I give her such a great deal every time I do services on her. 

Recently there was an event Tia and her boyfriend couldn’t come to. Where our other friends were. And my boyfriend brings up that Tias been bothering me. ( I was not planning on talking about that with them.) but they all three agreed that she can be rude and that they still see her as a friend but not a close one. Me and them have had a few more drunken talks about it. Some of the things we’ve said have been harsh. One of which I basically said I didn’t want to hang out with her at all, and another that I felt guilty for saying what I said. And for being nice to her face. 
I tried to not be fake and distance myself a little but it makes it awkward at work and it would be even more awkward if I confronted her.(I’m not good with that and it could get weird.) But the guilt is killing me! I’m hyper focused on it a lot of my day. She’ll say “love you” and I feel like I have to say it back. It’s all just gut wrenching. 

Should I feel guilty? And how do I stop feeling guilty? I’m a chronic over thinker and I really would appreciate some advice about what to do. Especially with hanging out all together moving forward.

134,1fg9ibg,AITA for yelling at my neighbors over them allowing their chicken to constantly run into my yard and leave chaos everywhere?,"I live in a suburban area. Recently, the neighbor got a chicken as a pet. I did not pay much mind to the fact that he had the chicken because the worst experience started when this chicken became a daily visitor to my yard. It's every day, every single day. The chicken poops on my lawn, digs around in my garden, and even leaves droppings on my porch. I've really had to clean up after this one, though, and it gets pretty frustrating.  
  
I approached my neighbors with this the first time by being really nice. So I am casually chatting with them one afternoon, pointing out that their chicken keeps wandering into my yard and asked if they could keep an eye on it. They brushed it off, saying, ""Oh, chickens like to roam! It's just what they do."" I tried to be patient because even then, the chicken kept wandering over and making a mess.  
  
After another few weeks or so like this, I brought it up again, this time more firmly. I told them it's getting to be a real problem and that I don't want to have to put up with their chicken in my yard every day. Still, they weren't taking it too seriously, at least, and just sort of agreed that they'd ""try"" to keep it in their own yard. Nothing changed, of course. The chicken kept on coming.  
  
The breaking point was when I went outside one morning and found that the chicken had destroyed part of my garden, digging around and ruining the plants I'd worked hard on. That's when I snapped. I went over to their house, clearly upset, and told them that this has to stop—that they need to keep their chicken out of my yard. They got very defensive and told me that it's just a chicken, and that I was being overreactive. They even told me I'm petty when they said, ""It's not like it's doing any real damage.""  
  
Now, things are kind of awkward between us. They think that I make a mountain out of a molehill, but I do not think that one needs to see the whole process- specifically the cleanup afterward-when someone else's pet ruins their garden.
