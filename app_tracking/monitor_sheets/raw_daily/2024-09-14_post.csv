0,1fgol2e,AITA for choosing a very bad time to come out?,"I (17MTF) have questioned for a year or so but recently realized & solidified that I am trans. I have a friend who I'll call Nadia who is also MTF. 

  
It took Nadia three years to come out. She told us in our group discord server around two months ago. 

A month or so later, I replied to her message and talked about my discomfort with being a man. A different friend of mine who I'll call Patrick replied to my message quickly and we talked in the server for a while over it, eventually culminating in me officially coming out as trans and announcing that tomorrow I was going to come out to my parents, which I did.

The issue is that my process of talking it over in the server was a lot less concise and less certain than Nadia's, and I could tell she thought I'd decided in a day to ""become"" trans with no forethought. It probably seemed dramatic to her. 

Anyway I'm not sure if this has to do with it, or the fact that we weren't super close to begin with, but Nadia has stopped really talking to me (we hadn't talked much before either) and we grew apart. I stopped talking with that group about being trans, because I didn't want to steamroll over her. 

I feel real bad I chose that time, and that I couldn't keep quiet about it until a more appropriate time, or at least be more certain and not make it seem like it was a fatuous, sudden ""decision"" of mine like I didn't know how gender works.
