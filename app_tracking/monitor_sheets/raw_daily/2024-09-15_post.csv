0,1fhgqpu,AITA for giving my friend a big tip? ,"Emily and I go to the same college. We have a bunch of classes together and we have become close over the years. 

She is trans and her parents have disowned her so she really struggles financially. She works a lot of hours in a cafe near our college. I often hang out with her there when the cafe is not busy. 

She has been really struggling to get by and I wanted to do something nice for her and so I left a nice tip (around 200 dollars) and she stopped me from leaving and gave it back and said she doesn't need it. She looked very very upset. She has been avoiding me the whole week and doesn't sit with me 

I feel like an idiot. I really didn't mean to offend her. It is not a lot of money and she is really struggling and I thought I would do something nice for her and suprise her but it backfired. She seemed so crushed when she handed me back the money.

1,1fhar9x,UPDATE: AITA for telling my co-worker that I didn't enjoy my pregnancy?,"Since posting, I have kept my distance from Linda as recommended by commenters, which has been tough because our work often overlaps and, y’know, we’re in the same team. Since then, I noticed she has snapped at other coworkers as well. I figured that commenters were right – that now her probation was over, the nice-girl act was over.

 Things were awkward.

 Then, I heard her crying in the bathroom. I didn’t want to get involved in case it caused another fight, but I also couldn’t just leave her there when there might be a problem, so I told ‘Tina’, our team lead, who then went to check on Linda. A while later, Tina came back and said she had sent Linda home as she wasn’t feeling well.

 A few days later, Linda came back to work. She asked to speak to me. Alone. It probably wasn’t the best idea, but I agreed to. And I’m glad I did.

 Linda apologised for how she snapped at me. I asked why she excluded me from ladies night. She said she didn’t invite me to the ladies night because I had told her I didn’t like them. To be fair I have a vague memory of this coming up in conversation a while ago. But she had something else to tell me.

 It turns out, some of you were right. Linda is pregnant. When she got sent home, her boyfriend asked her to take a pregnancy test because the last time she was pregnant, she got super broody, and her mood was all over the place - being happy one minute, bursting into tear the next, then being super irritable. As bad as she was being at work, she was even worse at home. She took a test and, yep, she’s pregnant.

 She told me she wanted me to be the first person in the office to know about it. I guess it was her way of apologising?

 I accepted her apology and chose to believe her about the ladies night, albeit cautiously. I’m still keeping a slight guard up, because who knows, for all I know this is a some game she’s playing, but for now, I am choosing to take her at her word.

 Obviously, her being pregnant doesn’t excuse how she spoke to me, but it does explain it, and if that genuinely is the issue, then hopefully that means the issue is solved.",UPDATE,2024-09-15,"UPDATE: AITA for telling my co-worker that I didn't enjoy my pregnancy?

2,1fhocd0,AITA for making my wedding dress shopping on a day my sister can’t go and not changing it. ,"I 20f am getting married to my fiancé 23m in October 2025. And my sister 29f and mom 61f are refusing to go wedding dress shopping with me. I recently moved to Georgia and will be having the wedding in Georgia, however the rest of my family lives in Florida. So I choose to go wedding dress shopping in Florida so my family can come with. I picked a date to go ,November 9th, and cleared in with my mom and future mother in law. However my sisters husbands birthday is November 10th. So she said it should be okay but shes not 100% sure yet. I took that as she could most likely come since it’s not his actually birthday and I only need a few hours. This specific weekend is good for me and my fiancé to fly down cause he has this specific weekend off for training and no other weekend around this time( we work opposite schedules). I wanted him to come to Florida with me not to go to the appointment but so I could have him by my side otherwise and share the excitement. I also wanted us to fly down together so we could visit each others families. However when I called today and told my sister and mom the plan they started yelling at me, they said my sisters husband has his birthday weekend that weekend. I said it should be fine because it is the day before his actual birthday. They told me they might want to take a trip for his birthday weekend and that I need to change my date. I told them why can’t they go the weekend before or after or maybe just leave later in the day for the trip. They told me to change it and I said no because I cleared it with both of them and there didn’t seem to be a problem, and that my fiancé can’t come down with me any other time. They both screamed and cried telling me I’m making my sister choose between her husband and me and telling me I’m being selfish, my mother then said she now is not going dress shopping with me that day and I can just go by myself. She then hung up on me and texted me this…
“This weekend should be all about the girls. You should pick a weekend you know everyone can go. Not say this is the day and fuck you if you can't go. You can choose any other weekend. You're not considering other people's feelings. Your sister really wants to go. And it could be that her husband  doesn't even want to go. But when you're doing something that involves several people, you have to consider them as well. Or just do the whole damn thing by yourself”. My sister has since texted me and told me she can go on the 9th now but I’m hurt by it and don’t even know if I want them to go anymore. This isn’t the first time they did this, they also complained because I’m having my wedding on Halloween and that it’s inconsiderate to my niece which might want to go trick or treating that day(she is 4) .

3,1fhoaj0,"AITA for arguing with my best friend that I feel like she’s prioritizing her new ""situationship"" over our friendship?","Hi everyone,

I (18F) need some advice about a situation with my best friend (19F). We have been best friends since first grade, so we’re really close. Recently, she broke up with her long-term boyfriend because he was mistreating her (they were long distance), which I fully supported. I recently set her up with one of my close guy friends (19M) a little over a week ago, and they’ve been hitting it off.

However, I’ve noticed that she only seems to come to the city to see him, not me. They just met, and I feel like I’m being treated like a pit stop. This past weekend, she came back to our city (she goes to school in a different city that’s a few hours away) and I didn’t even know she was coming until she asked me to hang out last minute. This is a recurring event as she also did this whenever she came into the city to see her previous boyfriend. 

I’m a very organized person, and I like to plan out hangouts in advance. She knows that too. I told her how I felt, but I don’t think she’s really listening to me. It seems like she only pays attention when I argue with her. 

To make matters worse, I did end up hanging out with them, but I felt like a third wheel the whole time. They would barely even include me in the conversations. When I needed to go home, it was really late, and the area of downtown that we were in is known to be very unsafe at night with a lot of dangerous people with substance abuse issues. They didn’t bother to walk me to the subway station which is about about 10 minutes from the guy’s place. 

I feel like I have to argue with her to get my point across that she doesn’t actually see me as a first choice when any man is in the picture.

We have been redoing our house for some time and it's had to be put on hold until my dad heals bc he does most of it. 

Ive been trying to get out large porch cleaned off, organized, and set up. Most is trash that's accumulated - nothing heavy but big - so I need an extra set of hands with carrying it and doors. I've been asking my 18f sister for weeks for help and she always puts it off, or my dad will just tell me to wait til just before trash day so it's not out all week, then forget and the cycle continues. 

This happens with a lot of what I want. As the oldest, my plans tend to come last, or change if others don't feel like doing it. I have to run on everyone else's schedule. So this week I lost it.

I snapped at my dad for making me put it off when he's not even helping. The youngest 2 want to help, but they're either too young to watch out for nails, or falling behind in school already and needs to focus.

Most patrons want to use the computers rather than check out books or DVDs.

Last week I was called in to help with new titles so this was one of the few occasions I worked with the other part-timer.  He seemed stressed despite there really not being a lot to be stressed about in the library.    
I was doing my thing and he was taking care of the desk when a young man and two young women came into the library to ask if they could print out something from the computer.  Immediately, my co-worker said, ""well, I don't know if there's enough ink"" and it wasn't said nicely.  The guy and two girls waited politely and eventually went back to use the computers.  They weren't there long, however, my co-worker repeatedly went back to check on them, for what I don't know as they were quietly doing their thing.

I know people are going to say that I sound quite materialistic but I just want to know of I'm being an AH 

My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Throughout these 3 years he's taken me for supper for both my birthdays and got me gifts besides for this year. Every year for his birthday I make a huge effort taking him to get a couples massage, getting him multiple gifts, taking him for suppers or lunches etc.

Before Covid, I used to commute to work but now I'm working fully remote so my car is parked in the garage. I still have insurance and drive the car once a week or less.

We mostly drive my wife's SUV for everything and take our kid on that. The only times my car is used is on rare occassions where we both go to do seperate errands.

She has been pressuring me to sell it for some time. I haven't done any service on my car for almost 4 years so I recently took it to the dealership and spend over $2000 to fix various issues (brakes, spark plugs, etc). This led to a huge fight and she is accusing me of wasting money and to sell it.

I fought back saying it was necessary as I hadn't done any service for years and she said I should've went to a normal mechanic instead of the dealership who overcharge. I do understand that but I took it to the dealership for peace of mind since I didn't take it for years. From now on, I'll go to the local mechanic.

She is trying to force me to sell my car as its not much use. I can sell my car for around $15,000 but I feel like its not necessary. I can cancel insurance but I don't see the reason we should sell it.

11,1fhmkql,AITA for telling my mom if she wanted photos of me as a kid she should've taken some?,"Sorry if this is confusing. I wrote it out in segments out of order, then tried to rearrange it to make sense.

My (31F) mother (58F) falls in and out of hobbies a lot. Recently she has decided to get into scrap booking. She realized though that she doesn't have many ""good"" pictures of me growing up to put in her scrapbook but plenty of my siblings (37M and 37F). She asked if I could help her at all with that and I told her unfortunately I can't go back in time, and that if she wanted photos of me she should've taken some. 

She scolded me and said she was just asking if I ""remembered where they were"". Even if they existed, my parents have moved house multiple times. I've never even been to their current house (I've been physically disabled since birth) and their current place has stairs and I don't feel like dealing with that.

But I just know that there aren't pictures of me. Even as a kid, I was aware that my family had less photos of me than my siblings. My brother and sister each had their own photo albums that were filled with photos. So many of them from when they were very little. Waned a bit when they got older. Many of the photos stopped being in the albums but instead were just in a box. But there were still photos for things all my siblings' things including birthdays, boy scouts, basketball, band practice (and things that start with other letters too). I remember being 10 or 11 and asking my mom about why there was nothing for me and I got shrugged off. Something about just not having the time or energy for it. Which she does fall in and out of hobbies a lot so I understood but it still hurt little kid me. 

As far as I know, my parents have maybe 10 photos of me before the age of 16. Almost all taken at a distance as part of a larger family photo (so not really photos ""of me"" in the same way my siblings have photos ""of them""). 

Those aren't the only photos of me though.

For a few summers as a kid, my parents would send me to a free ""summer camp"" for disabled children. When I was 14, one of the volunteers who I had a closer relationship with told me she was moving. She gave me a simple photo book to remember her by filled with dozens of photos of me and her at that camp. I don't look at the photos much. Its often a little hard emotionally to look at them. But I appreciate that she cared for me enough to gift me them. 

My boyfriend (33M) says that what I told my mom is very mean and unfair. That my parents may not have been the best but they still love me and want to include me in their memories. He knows that those photos exist (he found them when we moved in together and flipped through them) and thinks I should've just given them to my mom, or made copies for her, instead of being petty. I don't want to, though. Mostly because they're not her memories of me. They're my memories with a woman who cared enough to take them.

Edit: Okay I didn't know how to properly respond to the people who are upset with my boyfriend but I am going to say that I am confident that he WILL NOT swipe these photos and give them to my mom. I only mentioned him in this situation because he voiced his opinion that I was being petty.

12,1fhmc3b,WIBTAH for not allowing my friend to stay at my apartment because I don't want to get involved in a drama that I was never a part of?,"Hi! This might just be a small rant or vent, but I need some advice as I'm stuck and don't know how to go from here. I (21f) am a senior in college trying to earn my bachelor's in illustration. I'm living in a two bedroom apartment with a new roommate, with my parents paying half of my rent, and I'm currently stuck with a problem with a friend I've known since my sophomore year. I'm just going to name her Erin for now.

I've known Erin (35f) since she started working at McDonald's. I worked there for about a year when she joined. Erin was the only employee I could talk to, becoming close friends in the process. Besides my roommate, she was one of the only people I could talk to, especially as most of my support group doesn't live in the same city as me. Now, as we have separate jobs, we still hang out together. However, there has been a feud in Erin's family that has caused her apartment to get involved. I don't believe I need to speak about her issues online but there was a criminal dispute with her brother and boyfriend that caused the apartment to step in. With Erin's eviction court date tomorrow, it's most likely she'll completely lose her apartment. She's on a waiting list for other places but she's quite low on that list, possibly close to being stuck in a shelter.

Here's the problem, the drama with her brother and dad is so complicated and if I'm willing to take her in, I could possibly get into that drama and be stuck with two deadbeats that could possibly try and take over my place. I've been doing good to stay out but Erin has been enabling their behavior for years that I'm scared they're going to get me involved and I could get kicked out of my own apartment because of them. Her boyfriend is the only one I trust in this situation but because of his current criminal charge, because she enables them, I don't want my apartment to also step in and kick me out too when I'm so close to the finish line. I need to finish school badly and I feel like this situation is not only stressing me out but it's causing me to regress in school when I'm so close. I'm also 21, I'm still trying to find my own fitting and I feel like I'm getting thrown into a whole lot of family drama that's possibly older than I am. I've talked to her about my concerns about the drama but she's been silent for most of it, almost guilty and defending her family, despite mine and her boyfriend's concerns.

I feel like I could be the bad guy for saying no, and I don't want to lose my close friend over something I can't control. My parents and other friends are on my side, including my dad who's been through this stuff, especially working as a police officer. However, I don't think they realize what I go through and think it's easy, but it's not easy. Her boyfriend seems to be stuck in the middle, which I completely understand. He wants the best for her but knows the concerns with the drama and my possible final decision. I think getting help from others might help me move forward as the court date approaches.

Would I be the asshole for not letting my friend stay at my place because of a drama I don't want to be involved in, and could possibly be kicked out because of it, despite her situation of possibly being evicted?  


EDIT: Thanks for the comments so far! It puts everything into perspective honestly, and I'm just being stupid. There was something I needed to address since it wasn't clear enough before. My roommate and I don't split the rent, the apartment company has it in place where roommates have their own rent to pay, so it doesn't become an issue. We have a default amount of money we pay, but as I have an animal in my care, I pay more than her. My parents pay half of mine because of how expensive it is, but I still pay for my share, especially with how tight money is for us. How my roommate pays her rent is up to her. My roommate knows about the situation and she also had concerns about it too. I'm completely taking her side.

Another point, even though Erin's boyfriend has a criminal charge on him, I still trust him for a reason. He's completely against the drama and actively has been trying to kick the deadbeats out. He knows it's unhealthy and the criminal charge was super unnecessary on him, especially when he wants to protect her, not hurt her. He's also making it clear that I can't get involved at all and wants me away from it at any cost, and just be a friend. I'm thankful she has him in her life. 

This whole post really shows how much of a doormat and immature I am. I'm still super anxious about it, crying nonstop because I feel like a burden to everyone I'm friends with. However, that's not my place for reddit, that's for a therapist lol.

14,1fhm3ol,AITA for stopping my boyfriend from staying in his Mum's every week? ,"Hey guys, expectant mother 5 months along here. I'm posting this in regards to my boyfriend of 10 years, who as seen in the title, stays in my MIL's every week and has done for the better part of two years. My issue is that I feel like this should be stopping now that he has a baby on the way, but even when I ask him what would be wrong with just visiting for a few hours and coming home he just says ""I have to stay, she doesn't like being on her own"", and then procceeds to leave the house at 9pm and i dont see him again until 5pm the next day after we're both home from work. (I've also argued how pointless it is for him to be getting to her house at 10pm only to go asleep 3 hours later as opposed to visiting in the evenings and coming home later on).

I already know his mum couldn't care less about people staying, it's his older brother who is constantly bossing my boyfriend around making him believe someone needs to stay with her every night. My BIL, who only lives a couple of houses away from my MIL (we live a 30 minute bus ride away) and who lives on his own with no other family responsibilties of his own (no kids, no girlfriend, works part time whilst we're both full time). Apparantly, my BIL also stays with her a couple of nights and has her stay in his too and both my boyfriends Dad and Uncle live in the same street too along with a secure group of friends that my MIL has so it's not like she's deprived of nearby support.

I'm torn between feeling bad and as though it's not my place to criticise and talk badly about his brother to my boyfriend, and on the other hand severely annoyed that he's not yet worked up the courage to tell his brother there's no need for him to stay the night when he can merely visit in the evening instead. Especially now that we have a baby coming - I'm finding it really out of order that his brother is still expecting this of him when 1. he knows he has a pregnant girlfriend at home and 2. no health care professional has ever once mentioned anything about his mum needing overnight care.

We immigrated to Mexico from China and have lived here for about 14 years now. I run a small grocery store and work hard to provide for my family and make sure my son has everything he needs, especially education-wise.

The problem is, I don't always get to spend enough time with him, and I can see it's taking a toll on him. He's a great kid and he really loves soccer. I know other dads from his school come to practices and games, and I know he notices my absence. He never says it out loud, but I can feel his disappointment when I miss these moments. I feel guilty about it every day.

I promised myself that I would be at his soccer game against another school tomorrow. It means a lot to him, and I want him to know that I care and support him.

I (36, male) have a 16-year-old son who I love with all my heart. We immigrated to Mexico from China and have lived here for about 14 years now. I run a small grocery store and work hard to provide for my family and make sure my son has everything he needs, especially education-wise.

The problem is, I don't always get to spend enough time with him, and I can see it's taking a toll on him. He's a great kid and he really loves soccer. I know other dads from his school come to practices and games, and I know he notices my absence. He never says it out loud, but I can feel his disappointment when I miss these moments. I feel guilty about it every day.

I promised myself that I would be at his soccer game against another school tomorrow. It means a lot to him, and I want him to know that I care and support him.

19,1fhll69,AITA for refusing to go to my sister's wedding after she disrespected my late wife and demanded a family heirloom?,"I (32F) lost my wife, Lily (30F), two years ago in a drunk driving accident. Losing her shattered my world, and I’ve been trying to pick up the pieces ever since. My family, though, has never really understood what I’ve been going through. To be honest, they never fully accepted my marriage to Lily in the first place.

When we got married, my grandma gave me a necklace that’s been passed down in our family for generations. It’s a tradition that the women in the family get it when they marry, and it meant the world to me because it felt like one of the few times my marriage to Lily was actually recognized as real. Since Lily passed, my sister Emma (28F), who’s always been the golden child, has been eyeing the necklace. She’s getting married soon and recently mentioned how, now that I’m “not really married anymore,” I should pass it on to her.

That was hard to hear, but what really broke me happened last week at a family dinner. We were talking about her wedding, and she made a joke about setting me up with one of her fiancé Luke’s (35M) friends. I felt uncomfortable, but tried to brush it off. Then she said, “At least Lily won’t be there to haunt you if you hook up with someone!”

I couldn’t believe she said that. I didn’t even know how to react—I just sat there. Later, when I told her how hurtful it was, she rolled her eyes and told me I was being “too sensitive,” that I needed to stop being “so depressing” and “lighten up.” Then she brought up one of her bridesmaids, Sarah, who had a crush on me even when Lily was alive, and suggested I “have some fun” with her at the wedding. As if my wife hadn’t mattered.

I told her there was no way I could come to the wedding if that’s how she feels about Lily and my grief. Things escalated from there. Emma accused me of being “dramatic” and said I was ruining her big day over “one little joke.” My parents took her side, saying I should just let it go and show up to support my sister. They even mentioned again how I should give Emma the family necklace, saying that since I’m “not using it anymore,” it should go to her now.

Since then, I’ve been bombarded with calls from my parents, Emma, and even Luke. They’ve all told me I’m selfish, that I need to “move on” and stop holding onto the past. Luke even said I should be grateful my family didn’t disown me when I came out, as if I owe them something for barely tolerating me.

Now, I’m questioning everything. Am I being unreasonable for not wanting to go to her wedding after all this? Part of me wonders if I should just suck it up and go, but another part of me can’t believe how little my family seems to care about Lily, or me, for that matter.

Sorry if this is a bit rambling—I’ve had a few drinks and I’m still trying to process everything. There’s more to this, but I’m running out of space.

I wasn't supposed to be able to have her, to be pregnant but miracle miracle, she's here and everyday I'm thankful for the person she is. She might be young but she is smart, kind and a beautiful soul. 

I always had this thing with my best friend (F36), L, about the fact that if I got pregnant, she would be the godmother. So, years later, when I discovered that I was indeed pregnant, L was eager to meet her goddaughter. Something she had the honor of doing first when we left the hospital. She was the first for everything. Ultrasounds, baby's gender, name... Everything.

But after that, there was no one anymore. L wouldn't come to see us or if she did, would not really interact with M much, would try everything to frustrate her to teach her how to be though (she was months old) and now she acts like M is really exhausting and overbearing. She wouldn't ever ask about her when we were on phonecalls. L is really strict with M and seriously, it's saddening because M just wants her godmother actually and told her clearly. M loves her GM and of course, when L comes home, M wants to play and be with her. I already talked about it with L and she promised she would do better. Nope, still not. 

The thing is : M understands that something isn't right. That it's not how her GM is supposed to be with her. She should be like an other parent for her, thing she can have with my SIL or a friend of mine that is also the mother of her best friend. So of course, smart as she is (and seriously, sometimes it's scary), she began questionning the whole situation, asking me why and how. So I told her how a GM is supposed to be or at least act and that if one day, she needed to chose someone else because she thought it could be the right GM for her, it was okay. Because of course she asked me if she could.

Remember M is 4 so it's insane for me. 

So yesterday, when we were at my SIL house for family day, M came to me and asked me if she could call her aunt (SIL) her GM. I was surprised and told her she already had L. But M told me she wanted SIL to be her GM from now on. That she decided that for herself and that SIL took good care of her. So I told her to go ask her aunt, since it wasn't my decision anymore. 

My SIL cried when M asked her. I know it was always her dream to be her GM, she's the only niece, especially when her hub is also M godfather so it just clicked in place. SIL said yes, of course and since then it feels like M feels better about the whole thing. 

Later MIL asked me what about L and how she would react, that i could be the AH so I explained to her what happened, how it happened and said that it was M feelings here and not mine. That M already verbalized all those things multiple times.

21,1fhlb8b,"AITAH for conspiring against my now ex-girlfriend, with the person she cheated on me with? ","I (24M) met my now ex girlfriend (24F) in September of last year during my study abroad year in university. I live in Germany and I met my now ex girlfriend (let’s call her ‘Lucy’) in Australia. Lucy was already a student there at the university when I started my exchange year and we met on campus. 
Everything was going great, we had so much in common, ranging from; our interests in video games, tv shows, how we conduct ourselves, our morals and ethics etc. Everything aligned so perfectly, it was hard to believe it was real. 

To give some background information about me, before leaving for Australia, I had never been in a serious relationship before, and I was still a virgin. The reasoning for this is due to me being quite old fashioned in terms of relationships. I am the person who only wants one partner for the rest of their lives and that’s it. 
So when Lucy came around, I couldn’t believe what was happening was real.
We had sex together after our first date, which was surprising to me, but it felt right for what we both wanted in that moment. It was amazing, I feel like this bonded us together and made us stronger. 
Everything was going great… until, I asked for her instagram, as we had only exchanged numbers on the night we first met. What I discovered on their instagram page was pictures of her and another man. I didn’t know what to feel. Had the person I just lost my virginity to been cheating on her boyfriend with me?
The next day, she met me in my dorm, sat me down and said “I know you probably have a lot of questions right now, so I’m going to tell you everything. I know you saw everything that is on my instagram page last night, and I’m sorry you had to see that. This is my boyfriend (let’s call him Craig), we are in an open relationship”. She later went on to state that she was sorry for not expressing this earlier when we first met and was sorry that this is the way I had to find out. She expressed that this was a long distance open relationship, in which her boyfriend had moved universities and was no longer in the same country as her. They had both agreed that whilst they were in separate countries they would now be in an open relationship. 
Lucy then went on to give me an out. She said that this was probably going to be messy, she understands that this probably wasn’t what I had signed up for. She asked me the question, should I leave? I did not respond as I was still trying to process everything. She took my silence as an answer and proceeded to leave, to which I pulled her back into my arms and kissed. That was her answer. I knew what we had was something special and I didn’t want to lose her. 

Over the next couple of months, as we were sleeping together more often, it just made sense to sleep at each others places, rather than me having to get an uber back to campus. This then meant that after seeing each other for just under 4 weeks, we had essentially moved in together and were sleeping in the same bed every single night. I got introduced to her flat mates and one of her best friends (let’s call him Nathan). Nathan is an incredible guy and I’m glad that I met him through her. We became very close friends aswell very quickly. 

For this story to progress, I need to provide some background information about Lucy. Lucy has diagnosed Bipolar disorder, ADHD, clinical depression and insomnia. Meaning that Lucy would often go through very manic episodes of where she did not act or talk like herself. 
I myself knew nothing about any of these disorders as I have never experienced them, nor had I done any prior research because I never needed to. But living with them is a whole different ballpark and seeing your partner go through these manic episodes is heartbreaking. I struggled for a while to disconnect her depression from myself, questioning if she were truly happy with me, why would she feel this way? Only through her explaining and my research was I able to separate the two, but that took some time. 

Anyways back to the story. Our relationship from the very beginning was founded on being open, honest and having great communication, which we did. There were tough conversations that happened but I am so grateful for them.
We would even talk about monogamy and how important it was for both of us. How we planned on getting married. I wouldnt have got into a relationship with Lucy if her open relationship partner was still actively seeing her and having sex with her in the same country. But as much as I talked about monogamy and that’s what I wanted, I was still technically in an open relationship which I signed up for. 

Fast forward some incredible months in Australia, after treating Lucy like the princess she is, cooking, talking to her the way she has always wanted to be talked to, learning her native language so we could connect on a deeper level and so much more, culminated in Lucy breaking up with her long distance open relationship boyfriend and choosing me to be in a monogamous relationship with. This was everything I could have dreamt of. It was finally just us two, the way it was meant to be and we became officially a couple in January of this year. 

With all this in mind there was always going to be the situation of when I had to go back home to Germany to finish my studies after the academic year had ended. We always tried to put this off so we wouldn’t get emotional but it was always at the back of our minds, so the remaining time we had left together, we knew was precious. 


But the day came, I had finished my study abroad year and had to get on my flight back home. We often talked about when we would see each other next and how it was going to be extremely tough being apart from each other after spending every second of the day with each other from the end of September till May. So, we got the plan together of Lucy coming to visit me in Germany for a whole month. Our relationship then shifted to a long-distance one in which we wanted to make work. I left in May and Lucy’s flight was for august. 
It was all going so well, staying on call with each other as the other slept, playing games long distance together and watching our favourite TV shows together etc.

Until, 

At the start of June this all stopped from Lucy’s side. We were no longer sleeping on the phone, we weren’t playing games and I barely even got a message back from them for weeks on end. I struggled to understand what was going on. I just associated this with Lucy’s new job that she had gotten since I had left and that she had little time (as she was working over time to save for the trip). But something felt off. I was not even getting a message back. It was a very dramatic shift. 
I had never felt so low in my life, I began to question everything. After I had treated Lucy so well when we were together I didn’t deserve to be treated like this myself. I expressed how neglected she made me feel and that I didn’t deserve that and something dramatic needed to change and fast. She apologised, said it was her struggling with her own depression and didn’t want to face it. We talked about this, moved on and looked forward to actually being in each others presence again in a few more weeks. 
Since we had moved past this all I was learning what she had got up to in those weeks we weren’t talking. She expressed that she reconnected with an old classmate from Uni (lets call her Samantha). She said how much she liked Samantha and that she missed being friends with her after loosing touch. There would be times when I would ring her and she would say she was out with Samantha and I would be so happy, knowing she has got a friend again that she really likes and connects with well. She talked about how well she fitted in with Samanthas family, that she got along with her mum and dad and her brother. It would often be Lucy, Samantha and her brother (let’s call him Josh) doing things together like going to the movies etc. 

Fast forward to august and we were finally together again. I felt on top of the world, the trials and tribulations of being in a long distance relationship were so worth it as we were in each others arms once more. The first couple weeks of her trip were amazing, she finally got to meet my parents for the first time, we explored everywhere, ate a lot, played a lot of games and watched some great tv shows, but something was off. 
In the evenings before she would go to bed, I would help read her to sleep to help with her insomnia, I noticed that she started getting phone calls from Samanthas brother. I saw that it was him, asked who was calling, to which Lucy replied, “oh it’s just a spam call”. After I had read her to sleep, I left her room and went to brush my teeth in the bathroom which was just next door. I then heard voices coming from her room, which was strange as I just seen her fall asleep. I could hear her speaking through the walls. I then went back into the room to check she was ok, to which she was immediately taken by surprise and looked visibly shocked. I said that I could hear talking and wanted to see if everything was alright. Lucy stated that what I could hear was her podcast as she didn’t fall asleep to me reading her to bed. 
From then on my suspicion grew. I then had noticed she was getting more phone calls from this person, One in which I showed her the phone, and asked, “What is Samanthas brother doing calling you at this time, isn’t it like 4am for them right now?”. To which I got a, oh I don’t know response, maybe something is up. 
There was clearly something up, and I was going to find out what it was. 
We had both previously, in Australia, been very open about each other going through one another’s phones, so we both knew the passwords etc. So, after watching some tv, i picked up her phone and mine without her knowing. She then went downstairs to play some games, whilst I ‘went to the bathroom’. 

What I discovered next I never saw coming. 

I went to find Josh on her snapchat and her text messages and discovered that she had been cheating on me with this person. I found everything, sex tapes, nudes, messages where they were calling each other the same names we called each other. But not only this, these things were happening in my childhood home in Germany aswell. I was disgusted, filled with anger and confusion. My heart was racing. I had discovered everything. So I took pictures as evidence, just in case she tried to deny anything. 
I went downstairs, interrupted her gaming session and said “We need to talk”. Her face was incredibly confused, shocked and scared. I said “I’m going to be giving you ONE chance right now to tell me everything that has been going on, and I’ll know whether you’re lying so you better tell the truth”. 
Lucy took a deep breath and said, “So you know?”. She then went on to confess everything. I was surprised. 
She said that she had been cheating on me with Samanthas brother Josh, and it had been going on since June, Which was less than 4 weeks after I had left the country. She found him conventionally attractive and slept with him on the first date. 
What I later found out was that, Josh, wasn’t even Samanthas brother. She had downloaded a dating app, met him on there and had been having sex with him ever since. 
I broke up with her on the spot. With this being my first ever relationship and never having to deal with anything like this before, I would say I held myself together quite well. I wasn’t aggressive, or physically harming, I was composed, calm and patient. I was surprised how I wasn’t angrier, I just wanted to know why she did what she did and find out more information. 

My now ex-girlfriend has stated that her Bipolar and manic episodes had never been as bad as when I had left. She was the most depressed she had ever been, and her mania was out of control. She said that the person she was during our long distance segment of our relationship was one who was not in control of her own body, as she was not on depression pills nor ADHD medication.

I know my own worth, I have a lot of confidence in myself, I respect myself a lot to know that this wasn’t what I deserved in the slightest. She knew that, and did it anyway. 
Breaking up with her was the right decision as if I didn’t, she would have no respect for me and think I had no self-respect either. She begged me to give her a chance to improve herself, get on meds, go to therapy etc. I declined. 

I asked Lucy whether Josh knew about me, she said she only described me as a friend. I asked about Nathan, because Nathan obviously knew we were in a relationship, what did she say to him about Josh. She said she told Nathan that I was aware of Josh, and was willing to open up the relationship so that she could be with him. Not only is this something I would never do as I strongly believe in monogamy and the foundations of a long lasting relationship but I was incredibly shocked that she lied about my character in this way. Made one of my closest friends believe I was ok with this. He was obviously not aware I was being cheated on as he believed her lies. 

The only thing about me finding out when I did, was we were only half way through her trip to Germany. I asked her to continue putting on her act in front of my parents as I was too embarrassed to admit this to them.
So we put on an act for the next two weeks, which was really hard for me, as this is the person I wanted to marry, all of a sudden I could not look at her the same way without thinking about her actions. 
After a couple days of this I said that It’s not only me that’s been affected by this, the guy she was cheating on me with was also not aware of what had been going on, and he deserved the right to know that he was the other man. Lucy told me that this would break his heart as he had been cheated on before by his ex wife and she needed time to tell him in person. I said that she needed to do it now, as stringing this guy along is not healthy and does not show the personal growth she talked so much about. 
Later that day she plucked up the courage, she rang him and a couple minutes later told me “It’s done”. She told me that she had said to him; she had been unfaithful, and that the trip to Germany wasn’t to meet family (the lie that she told him), but was to meet her boyfriends family for the first time, he was the person she cheated on me with, and that she needed a lot of space and no contact to get through this. She told me that he didn’t take it well as he just ended the call without saying a word. I thought this was the end of it all, but boy was I wrong. 

I began to feel for how this person would be feeling, and with my curiosity, wanted to hear his side of the story. 
So again, I went onto my ex girlfriend’s phone, found this guys number, put into onto mine and sent him a text via my phone. 
“Hey Josh, I am the person that Lucy cheated on with you. We need to talk about this man to man as I know that conversation you had with her must have been tough, let’s not tell her about this and talk about it together”. 

What I was about to find out shocked me so much. 
I found out from Josh that this was the first time him hearing any of this. That he was not aware of what had happened. I asked him about the breakup phone call he and Lucy had, he told me that she said she had gone through psychosis, went to the hospital and couldn’t remember anything about him, that she needed time and space to get her memory back. I didn’t realise I was telling him about this for the first time, this was not what I wanted and I would not have reached out if I knew this were the case.

Since then me and Josh had been talking about everything and uncovering the lies that Lucy had told us both, and both agreed that these were the traits of a Sociopath who clearly needed to be back on ADHD meds and needed therapy straight away. We have been getting on rather well actually. Both just flabbergasted by the reality we were both living in. We told each other everything and gave each other receipts aswell. 
Lucy was not aware that I knew the ‘breakup phone call’ was a sham, nor was she aware I was in contact with the very person she had cheated on me with. So, me and Josh decided to put together a plan of action on what we would both do over the next week, how Josh was going to break up with her etc.

Fast forward a week of me and Josh talking about this behind Lucys back and, me and Lucy acting as if everything was normal to my parents, it was time for Lucy to fly back home. 
Me and josh had a lot of fun in this period when she was at the airport, as now when Josh became convenient to her again, (as the original plan was for him to pick her up at the airport), when she got back home to Australia, she started messaging him again, not knowing he knew EVERYTHING. 
There would be times when I was on the phone with her to make sure she got to the gate ok, then josh would call her and she would end the phone call with me. He would text me saying he was on the phone with her and for me to call her, which resulted in her ending the phone call with him and starting to talk with me. Her essentially two boyfriends were in on everything and started to show her how crazy of a situation she had put us all in. It was straight out of an episode of TV. 

Finally, Josh picked her up at the airport, she thought everything was going back to normal and that she could get away with her believable lie she told him. He asked her had she cheated on him during her trip, she said no, has she ever cheated on anyone, she said no, was it the German friend she knew (me) that she had been In the open relationship, with her ex, she said no. 
I wont go into much more detail as this post is so long already, again I’m sorry there was just so much to say, but basically, he caught her in her lies, made her confess everything and broke up with her, told her that we had been in constant communication for a week and she was shocked. She had no idea about any of this. She didn’t expect it from either of us. She thought everything was going to go back to normal. She even admitted she never planned on telling him the truth.  

My question to Reddit is, am I the asshole? Did I go too far against someone who is clearly mentally unwell? 



",TL;DR,2024-09-15,"AITAH for conspiring against my now ex-girlfriend, with the person she cheated on me with?  I (24M) met my now ex girlfriend (24F) in September of last year during my study abroad year in university. I live in Germany and I met my now ex girlfriend (let’s call her ‘Lucy’) in Australia. Lucy was already a student there at the university when I started my exchange year and we met on campus. 
Everything was going great, we had so much in common, ranging from; our interests in video games, tv shows, how we conduct ourselves, our morals and ethics etc. Everything aligned so perfectly, it was hard to believe it was real. 

To give some background information about me, before leaving for Australia, I had never been in a serious relationship before, and I was still a virgin. The reasoning for this is due to me being quite old fashioned in terms of relationships. I am the person who only wants one partner for the rest of their lives and that’s it. 
So when Lucy came around, I couldn’t believe what was happening was real.
We had sex together after our first date, which was surprising to me, but it felt right for what we both wanted in that moment. It was amazing, I feel like this bonded us together and made us stronger. 
Everything was going great… until, I asked for her instagram, as we had only exchanged numbers on the night we first met. What I discovered on their instagram page was pictures of her and another man. I didn’t know what to feel. Had the person I just lost my virginity to been cheating on her boyfriend with me?
The next day, she met me in my dorm, sat me down and said “I know you probably have a lot of questions right now, so I’m going to tell you everything. I know you saw everything that is on my instagram page last night, and I’m sorry you had to see that. This is my boyfriend (let’s call him Craig), we are in an open relationship”. She later went on to state that she was sorry for not expressing this earlier when we first met and was sorry that this is the way I had to find out. She expressed that this was a long distance open relationship, in which her boyfriend had moved universities and was no longer in the same country as her. They had both agreed that whilst they were in separate countries they would now be in an open relationship. 
Lucy then went on to give me an out. She said that this was probably going to be messy, she understands that this probably wasn’t what I had signed up for. She asked me the question, should I leave? I did not respond as I was still trying to process everything. She took my silence as an answer and proceeded to leave, to which I pulled her back into my arms and kissed. That was her answer. I knew what we had was something special and I didn’t want to lose her. 

Over the next couple of months, as we were sleeping together more often, it just made sense to sleep at each others places, rather than me having to get an uber back to campus. This then meant that after seeing each other for just under 4 weeks, we had essentially moved in together and were sleeping in the same bed every single night. I got introduced to her flat mates and one of her best friends (let’s call him Nathan). Nathan is an incredible guy and I’m glad that I met him through her. We became very close friends aswell very quickly. 

For this story to progress, I need to provide some background information about Lucy. Lucy has diagnosed Bipolar disorder, ADHD, clinical depression and insomnia. Meaning that Lucy would often go through very manic episodes of where she did not act or talk like herself. 
I myself knew nothing about any of these disorders as I have never experienced them, nor had I done any prior research because I never needed to. But living with them is a whole different ballpark and seeing your partner go through these manic episodes is heartbreaking. I struggled for a while to disconnect her depression from myself, questioning if she were truly happy with me, why would she feel this way? Only through her explaining and my research was I able to separate the two, but that took some time. 

Anyways back to the story. Our relationship from the very beginning was founded on being open, honest and having great communication, which we did. There were tough conversations that happened but I am so grateful for them.
We would even talk about monogamy and how important it was for both of us. How we planned on getting married. I wouldnt have got into a relationship with Lucy if her open relationship partner was still actively seeing her and having sex with her in the same country. But as much as I talked about monogamy and that’s what I wanted, I was still technically in an open relationship which I signed up for. 

Fast forward some incredible months in Australia, after treating Lucy like the princess she is, cooking, talking to her the way she has always wanted to be talked to, learning her native language so we could connect on a deeper level and so much more, culminated in Lucy breaking up with her long distance open relationship boyfriend and choosing me to be in a monogamous relationship with. This was everything I could have dreamt of. It was finally just us two, the way it was meant to be and we became officially a couple in January of this year. 

With all this in mind there was always going to be the situation of when I had to go back home to Germany to finish my studies after the academic year had ended. We always tried to put this off so we wouldn’t get emotional but it was always at the back of our minds, so the remaining time we had left together, we knew was precious. 


But the day came, I had finished my study abroad year and had to get on my flight back home. We often talked about when we would see each other next and how it was going to be extremely tough being apart from each other after spending every second of the day with each other from the end of September till May. So, we got the plan together of Lucy coming to visit me in Germany for a whole month. Our relationship then shifted to a long-distance one in which we wanted to make work. I left in May and Lucy’s flight was for august.

My family came to visit. They never ask, they just say and drop by. It’s more frequent ever since my brother and I were forced to take in our cousins too.

The other weekend they visited and they tried to buy a car (I work at a car dealership), I spent 6 hours helping them just for my uncle to scream over the phone to go to a Toyota or Honda, which is fair, those are reliable makes, but my family had already said they were open to others. Their first priority was price and I felt confident with my employee discount, they’d be happy. In the end, my uncles yelling won out and they decided to not buy anything, it was the most stressful day I had at work ever.

I was nice to them about it, didn’t complain once. Since, my mom said she was interested in a Silverado we had a 1.9% APR on, and I had been passing on info for her. Saturday at work, I have a customer at my desk and my family walks in. I said “oh, hi mom! You guys should have called! I have a customer now, I guess someone else would have to help yall” she frowned and handed me lunch and said they were just brining me food, and I said thank you. They then started walking out and said “that was rude.” I was confused, thinking perhaps one of the employees said something rude, and I said, “what was rude?” And then she said “you were rude.” I was taken back because I said everything with a smile and in my busy flow, thought she stopped by to check out the Silverado and I simply wanted to explain that I wished I could have been available to help. 

She then just said check your phone and left. I saw 1 missed call but no text about 30 mins before they came in. I sent her an apology text and thanked her for the lunch. She left me on read and then left town without saying goodbye. I felt very bad but not sure what I said that could have offended her.

My working so hard (3 jobs) is all so I’m able to show them I’m good enough and worthy of respect. I cut out all my vices and don’t date anymore so they would think better of me. I’ve been in therapy for months trying to better myself. I try my best to pick my battles and rarely say when my family has hurt me or said something rude. In the past they’ve made comments about my weight (I’m around 100lbs at 5ft), told they would not support me being lgbt, and on my bday said they’d “take me to India to get an arranged marriage” despite my entire family knowing about a traumatic incident in my past where I was manipulated into going to India and then my passport was taken away and I was forced to stay there for 9 months until I agreed to get married and pregnant. When I told my mom it hurt me a few days later, she defended my uncle (Chevrolet hater) and said I was being overly sensitive. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-15,"AITA for being too busy for my family?

The other weekend they visited and they tried to buy a car (I work at a car dealership), I spent 6 hours helping them just for my uncle to scream over the phone to go to a Toyota or Honda, which is fair, those are reliable makes, but my family had already said they were open to others. Their first priority was price and I felt confident with my employee discount, they’d be happy. In the end, my uncles yelling won out and they decided to not buy anything, it was the most stressful day I had at work ever.

I was nice to them about it, didn’t complain once. Since, my mom said she was interested in a Silverado we had a 1.9% APR on, and I had been passing on info for her. Saturday at work, I have a customer at my desk and my family walks in. I said “oh, hi mom! You guys should have called! I have a customer now, I guess someone else would have to help yall” she frowned and handed me lunch and said they were just brining me food, and I said thank you. They then started walking out and said “that was rude.” I was confused, thinking perhaps one of the employees said something rude, and I said, “what was rude?” And then she said “you were rude.” I was taken back because I said everything with a smile and in my busy flow, thought she stopped by to check out the Silverado and I simply wanted to explain that I wished I could have been available to help. 

She then just said check your phone and left. I saw 1 missed call but no text about 30 mins before they came in. I sent her an apology text and thanked her for the lunch. She left me on read and then left town without saying goodbye. I felt very bad but not sure what I said that could have offended her.

My working so hard (3 jobs) is all so I’m able to show them I’m good enough and worthy of respect. I cut out all my vices and don’t date anymore so they would think better of me. I’ve been in therapy for months trying to better myself. I try my best to pick my battles and rarely say when my family has hurt me or said something rude. In the past they’ve made comments about my weight (I’m around 100lbs at 5ft), told they would not support me being lgbt, and on my bday said they’d “take me to India to get an arranged marriage” despite my entire family knowing about a traumatic incident in my past where I was manipulated into going to India and then my passport was taken away and I was forced to stay there for 9 months until I agreed to get married and pregnant. When I told my mom it hurt me a few days later, she defended my uncle (Chevrolet hater) and said I was being overly sensitive. ",0.0,-0.0057763690128922,0,1
23,1fhl819,WIBTA if I don’t go to my niece’s baby shower. ,"My niece (early 20s) is pregnant with her first child. (For those that care, she’s technically my step-niece and I first met her when she was a teen.) At the end of October, she’s having a baby shower in my home town. The only reason I’m not sure about going is that I know live about 7 hours away, and I can’t justify going up for that AND Christmas due to money and my family being unhealthy as a whole. This niece’s stepmom (my sister in her 40s) I’ve gone extremely low contact with for my mental health. 

No matter what, I’ll be getting a gift as I want to support my niece. I’m just torn on going for the bridal shower. So give your polite opinions, please. 

EDIT: Thank you everybody. You all have helped. I’ll be sending a gift with a book. (A book has been requested instead of a card, and I’m 1,000% happy to meet that request). I just have to figure out if I ship through Amazon and ask my mom or sister (a second sister, not the same one I’m extremely low contact with) to wrap it, send a book and gift card for her to get things she didn’t get (or more of the consumables needed), or ship a wrapped gift. Thank you for helping me figure out that my feeling like I was required to go was the result of, well a crap upbringing. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-15,"WIBTA if I don’t go to my niece’s baby shower.

25,1fhkdck,AITA For sending screenshots of my friend's vent to my other friends?,"This is going to be a long story so I will try to sum it down as much as I can. I have a small friend group that involves 3 other people. They are Tom, Orion and Wade (obviously these are not their real names). Orion and Wade are together in a relationship, this is important to mention as their relationship seems to be the main issue.

Before I get into recent events, I need to explain what led up to this event. Tom always has an issue with hearing people out or talking to people about stuff. I never really cared or took notice of it until after this event. When Orion and Wade got together, it seemed that Tom's issues became more prominent. At some point, we had to talk to Orion and Wade about things that made us uncomfortable or that made us not happy. And by we, I mean me, just me, I talked to them. All Tom did was explain to me about those issues and left the group, I tried to offer for him to explain his issues to Orion and Wade but he refused multiple times. It was annoying at first because he was the one with the most issues yet refused to talk to them about it. At the end of the day, he still missed them so I cleared up everything and we were all friends again. 

Except this happened multiple times. Tom has an issue, he leaves the group without telling Wade or Orion, he tells me and I have to tell them. All while Tom refuses to even talk about those issues at all and when Wade and Orion do try to talk to Tom about it, he changes the topic or literally ignores them. 

Fast forward to recent events, Tom was complaining to another friend group about Orion and Wade. It was stuff about their relationship again. People told him to talk about it with them if he has an issue but he claims he did (he hasn't) and people then say why are you still with them and he doesn't answer. The things Tom complained about, I brought up to Orion and Wade vaguely about it, and I learned that Tom was literally just talking shit and the problems Tom is having could easily be solved by talking to them. Tom is just genuinely making Orion and Wade look like bad people and getting others to agree with him. 

So I took screenshots of the things he said and shared it with Orion and Wade. Tom was then cut from the group because when confronted, he doubled down on his statements and refused to talk to them about it. He has sense then cut everyone from all groups as he claims he doesn't care about Orion and Wade but only the rat who sent those screenshots.

Apparently doing this, my friend's told me I violated Tom's privacy for sharing personal stuff (I should mention, where Tom was sharing this, literally everyone can see it so this was not talked about in DMs at all) and that it was wrong of me to do so. They don't understand my POV and said I shouldn't have not got involved.

26,1fhk5o5,AITA for expecting my sister to give me some of her education fund even though I am done school?,"I (19F) am already done school. I didn't know what I wanted to do right out of high school so I decided to do a one year electrical program. My sister, (22F) is currently in her last semester of school and did a 4 1/2 year science degree. 

While I was in school last year, our dad told us that he had an education fund set up and it was now eligible to be taken out. When we found out about it, my sister and I decided it would be split 50/50. 

It is now over a year later. There were a few issues taking it out since we were both living away from home, and it required a lot of paperwork. Technically, I am no longer a student, meaning the money can't be processed under my name, and all of the money (\~$13,000) was deposited into my sister's account. 

This is where the problem starts. When we originally discussed splitting it 50/50, I was planning to do a different 2 year program, but due to small class sizes, they got rid of the course. I couldn't find any other good programs, so I decided to work for now. I offered to take $3000 and my sister could have the remaining $10,000 but now she doesn't think I should get anything.

I 100% understand where she is coming from because she has debt she has to pay off, but if this was last year, she would've only gotten $6,500 and she had no complaints then. 

I don't think it's fair that I don't get *any* of the money.

If the roles were reversed, yes, I would be pissed, but you need to hear me out here. The only reason I  think I'm not the asshole is that last year, our grandma decided that instead of us getting money from her will when she dies, she was going to give all of her grandchildren the money now so she could see us enjoy it. The only catch is that we weren't able to get it until we graduated from school. Once again, im done school, so I got $20,000 that my sister hasn't. 

My mom recently upgraded her car and had to decide what kid to give it to. Since financially, I was in a better position, my sister got my mom's old car and I had to buy one myself. The car market is bad where I live so spent $14,000 on a used car - so back to the main story.

Since I had to spend a huge chunk of my grandma's money to buy a car, I think that it's only fair that this education fund is shared at least a little bit. She would be getting $33,000, which would fully pay her debt and leave her with lots left over. 

My mom agrees that me getting $3000 is fair but my sister won't send the money.

27,1fhjowd,AITA for declining a father’s friend offering me a job,"This man has been my fathers friend for a long time and his wife has a famous skin and wellness clinic in our city. Their children are settled abroad and are totally unwilling to join them even though the business is going really good. 

Now, I have not been working for sometime and maybe in some random conversation he may have asked my father to convince me to join them. Not that I am pressured but I find the constant attempts very strange.

So the basic of this is that they want me to work along with his wife but they never disclose what exactly they want me to do just that eventually my father can invest in their business and kick start another office in the same city. 

I have always been skeptical because this man has once very long ago betrayed my father and even when they have patched up I know for a fact this is his way of being satisfied by “employing” me and earn a favor. 

Why would he want a favor from my father you may ask? He’s an extremely honest and trustworthy man they also expect an investment from in the future. 

He’s so adamant all the time “send her to our office, she’ll learn  and we’ll also be glad to have someone we trust blindly” and what not. 
But he never discloses what they want or what the pay would be like. 

It always sounds like being invited to enter a dark cave. 

I have had a massive argument too with my parents because I have never met this guy regarding this even after 20 times him calling me or my father. My father just says you can go listen to him and simply decline(he’s never pressured me to do it) and I don’t want to do that. 

Am I overthinking this? I know it doesn’t sound too horrible to some people thinking it’s innocent but this man has had history. In my brain it just seems like he wants a person he knows, put them down and also boast about it. 

I’m very confused. 

Little background: I’ve returned to my home country after a masters(UK) as I wanted to stay with my parents as they’re both nearing their 70s and theirs no one who is reliable enough to take care of them in my absence even temporarily. 

We’ve known this family for over 25 years with one fallout maybe 10 years ago. He says he wants to get me involved in marketing and that’s the MAX he says about it.

28,1fhjn0o,AITA for taking my dog inside after she did not go potty?,"
Okay so first time Reddit poster, F 22, so anyway my boyfriend and I of 6 months M 26 were taking my dog Penny (fake name) out on a walk. Penny has some leash reactivity and leash anxiety. I believe storm anxiety too but besides the point. Anyways we were walking for about 10 minutes when I noticed her body language was very stiff and tail hiked up, on alert and looking around constantly. About 20 minutes in, she started open mouth panting. I had been wanting to take her inside by this point but he was worried about an accident on the carpet. (Because he didn’t want to wake up and pick it up, but had nerves brought this concern up in past conversations, has even said he’s okay with picking up accidents) he says it’s because it interrupts his sleep, I told him he could wake me up to pick it up no problem. He then asked if he could hold her leash as an attempt to “get her to go”. For another 5 minutes it did not work. I then took the leash and went inside because I could see she was not doing very well. 
I then started to try to tell him how when I talk to him about certain things I get the feeling that he always needs to be right or gets pretty defensive if anything negative about him or his actions are brought up. I specifically remember saying “I’ve been working with dogs for over 7 years (in doggy daycare) and that I spend my free time trying to learn more about these things. She’s not going to go potty outside tonight, she’s too anxious. If she has an accident I’ll pick it up”
He then kept asking me if he could take her out later and I kept trying to explain I really don’t think she will. She’s 5 and I know her behavior. He was being snappy and just saying “okay well then what do we do if she has an accident” and I kept saying I’d pick it up. I felt like we were going in circles and I eventually snapped and said “I never feel like you listen to me. If it’s anything negative about you or something you disagree with you just HAVE to argue. You can’t just listen to how you made me feel or what may have upset me.” 
I then stormed off. I’m now writing this in my bathroom. We have fights like this quite often currently. I’m not sure why. I just don’t understand how to get him to listen or care about how I feel. And this time really got to me because I feel like it has to do with the well being of my pup Penny. Just needing advice and more over please tell me if I’m the asshole.

At this wedding we met F26 who we’ll call Petal. Petal was incredibly sweet and we had a grand time with her. We met Petals fiancé as well M24 who we’ll call Flower. Now we, Tomato and I, got invited at the very end of the night when everyone had a little drink. 

So me and Petal exchange socials to stay in touch and to this day months after the wedding we chat a lot and talk almost daily. Truly there has been a friendship brewing between Petal and I. 

So today Petal messaged me saying that her budget for the wedding is quite limited. I don’t feel it is my place to question the expenses of a wedding and I will not push Petals limits ofcourse. So Petal broke the news to me that Tomato isn’t invited anymore. And has asked me to tell Tomato as Petal hasn’t had any contact with her since the og wedding.

31,1fhj906,AITA My wife put a small garbage can in the fridge,"For context, my wife is a super green 0 emissions kind of person.

This is a very complicated process, one in which I never help since I work full time and don't have the time.

Sometimes, there's some processed food which she says cannot be composted so we but them all in a bag in the freezer and wait for the garbage guy to take it.

However, today I found the entire tiny garbage can we keep in the kitchen inside the fridge. She saw my face and I just said ""there's a garbage can in the fridge"" and she answered that ""it is organic, but I it bothers you that much I can go ahead and compost it instead of going out with you for lunch like we agreed to"". I didn't reply, she just stormed out and all I asked was if she wanted me to go get lunch for the both of us or wait for her, but she just said ""whatever"" and left.

When the topic of accommodation came up , everyone had zeroed in on a 4 bedroom, 3 bath Airbnb . Out of the 9 people, there are 2 couples and they get two bedrooms and the attached bathrooms. Which means the other 5 of us will be splitting 2 bedrooms and a single bathroom. 
 
I’ve certainly done that in the past but I feel like I’m too old (31) and make enough money not to have to share a bathroom with 4 people. Also would have been ok with it if it was just a quick weekend , this is an 8 day trip and I really don’t want to go travel under this arrangement. 

So I let them know that I’ll be getting a hotel nearby but I’ll still be part of all the plans we originally had. People got upset that I’m not being part of the team , trying to guilt trip that we’re all seeing each other after a long time and I argued mine was a reasonable compromise. 

Also a couple of them brought up how this would increase the Airbnb costs for the others as it’s one person less now even though I’d be paying more for staying alone.

Later, I texted my BIL, telling him that next time, he should ask for permission before using my car. I also asked him to imagine how he’d feel if I took his car without asking.

36,1fhimdv,AITA for telling my stepmom's work friend my stepmom's my stepmom and not my mom?,"My stepmom's been in my life since I (16m) was 6. My mom died when I was 3 and I don't remember her. But even though I don't, she's the only person I ever called mom. I use my stepmom's first name most of the time. Like if I'm talking to her and about her. But I'll say stepmom if I need to clarify. I also correct anyone who calls her my mom but I don't act like a jerk about it. I know most people will make the assumption and I know she acts like my mom. She also calls me her son so it's going to happen.

I know it bothers her that I don't call her mom. But I can't bring myself to and I've had therapy, solo and therapy with my stepmom. It didn't make me see her as my mom afterward. That's not me trying to disrespect her but even though I don't remember mom, even though she only raised me for three years, and even though my stepmom has been in my life for 10 years now, since elementary school, my mom is still my mom. She gave birth to me and would have raised me if she'd lived. Like I know she's not here. But to me it's still important to acknowledge her and to say that I still think she's my only mom. And I get I could have two. I could say both are my mom. But I just never felt that way. And nobody influenced it either. I know people think that. I've been asked before if anyone said something and that's why I feel this way. I just do.

So my stepmom has this work friend. I never met her before last week but they've known each other for live five years and she was told my stepmom had three kids, my two half siblings and me. She believed we were all her bio kids. When my stepmom's work friend came to our house she sorta scolded me for calling my stepmom by her first name. She did it in the ""teens don't think about respect"" way and I told her I call her by her first name because she's my stepmom and not my mom. The work friend was like wait, what? My stepmom heard and told her she's raised me since I was 6 and my ""birth mom"" died. The work friend looked awkward after that and she made excuses to leave.

After she left my dad and stepmom asked me why I did that and my stepmom told me I didn't need to correct her. I said her friend scolded me and I was making sure she knew I wasn't doing it because I didn't care about respect. She told me that's not true because 10 years would have earned enough respect to be called mom. My dad told my stepmom that wasn't fair either. My stepmom said I never treat her equally and she's tired of it. She told me that this shows I don't care about her feelings or her reputation and I don't love her enough to let it go.

37,1fhijmh,AITA for calling out my manager for her comment?,"
I (26M) moved to the US from India 8 years ago for undergrad and have been living in Chicago ever since. I recently changed jobs and now work at a small company (about 20 people). My manager is a mid-40s white woman, and so far, we’ve had a pretty neutral working relationship.

Last week, we were planning an event for prospective clients, and I suggested inviting a couple of my college friends who could potentially be interested. For context, these friends happen to be white, but obviously, that’s never been something I thought twice about.

Here’s where things got weird. My manager asked how I knew them, and I casually said, “Oh, they’re friends from college.” She paused, looked at me like she was surprised, and asked again, “How do you know them?” I thought it was a little odd she didn’t believe me the first time, but I repeated, “They’re friends from college.”

And then she said this: “Oh, that’s surprising considering you come from such different backgrounds.”

I was honestly taken aback. What the hell did she mean by that? I laughed a little, trying to give her a chance to clarify, and asked, “What do you mean by different backgrounds?” thinking she might walk it back.

Nope, she didn’t. She doubled down, implying that because I’m Indian and they’re white, it was somehow unexpected that we’d be friends. At that point, I was done being polite. I looked her straight in the eye and said, “Believe it or not, it’s 2024, and people from different races are friends.” Then, to really drive it home (and maybe I was being petty), I added, “I have a white girlfriend too, if you find that surprising as well.”

She immediately started backpedaling, saying, “Oh no, I didn’t mean it like that! I wasn’t trying to offend you!” but by then, I was just over it. I shrugged it off and said, “It’s all good,” but honestly, it didn’t feel good at all.

Now I’m wondering if I overreacted by calling her out like that. I get that maybe she didn’t mean to sound racist, but the way she kept pushing made me feel like I had to say something. I also wonder if bringing up my girlfriend was unnecessary or if I was right to hammer the point home.

38,1fhid19,AITA? For disagreeing with my grandparents on sending money over to my “mother” in El Salvador who wasn’t there my whole life.,"Hello Reddit, I’ll keep this short. I’m a 19-year-old woman studying engineering in college. I’m really into cars and music. Recently, I upgraded my project car by getting her a new exhaust with a muffler delete and straight pipe. I did my research to make sure it’s legal, and it is, as long as it’s not too loud.

My parents (well, my two grandmothers who raised me) found out about my upgrades. They’re starting to see how much I’m investing in my car since I love it so much. So, they sat me down and told me I should start sending money to my biological mother, who lives in El Salvador. I don’t understand why. She was never there for me—she didn’t even wish me a happy birthday when I turned 18. She missed all my birthdays and my graduation.

I get it though—she crossed deserts to give birth to me in a better place (Texas) before she was deported. I appreciate that she brought me into this life, but I didn’t ask to be born. School is expensive, with homework and textbooks. I invest in my car as a reward for my hard work, but now I’m conflicted. My grandmas said they don’t want to send money either but told me I should grow a bigger heart and help.

I just don’t get it. These days, money is essential to survive. I’d rather help the people who take care of me than the person who gave birth to me and then left.


At the same time. I feel bad. I don’t want to be seen as the bad person and seem cold heart but I work hard for this money. I can’t even save money for myself. I know if I resist, they will scowl me and say that I should do otherwise. I don’t want them to be upset in me. I just don’t find “doing these good deeds of sending money to someone who lives in poverty really makes you feel good” a reason to dump money on someone who just gave birth to me and that’s it. She got a family over there also, she got kids and a husband who I never met.

AITA for telling my grandparents that I dont really like the idea of sending money to my “mom” who never was in my life, never was there to give me advices and life lessons, who wasn’t there to feed me, and who wasn’t there to witness all my hard moments in life and the best moment of my life.

39,1fhhzn6,AITA for “bragging” my Miami trip and “not caring about real issues in my country”?,"So, this is my first time posting here, but I really need an outside perspective because something happened the other day, and I’m still trying to make sense of it. For context, I (21F) go to one of the top universities in Bogotá. Some people call it a “rich kid” school, and while it’s definitely expensive, I wouldn’t say that’s completely accurate.

Anyway, my friends and I are pretty tight-knit, and we talk about everything our plans, vacations, the usual. We’ve got this tradition where we go to Miami every year during a long weekend. It’s nothing crazy just some shopping, partying, and relaxing. So the other day in class, we were chatting about the trip, deciding where we might want to stay, where to shop, stuff like that. We weren’t even being loud or obnoxious about it.

Out of nowhere, this girl in class, who I don’t even know that well, just loses it on us. She stands up and starts going off about how we’re “dumb little rich girls” always bragging about our lifestyle and how we don’t care about real issues. She then starts rattling off stats about poverty in Colombia, inequality, and basically accuses us of spending money that could feed entire families. To top it off, she randomly complained about how we mix English and Spanish when we talk, which felt completely irrelevant.

The whole class was just stunned. Even the professor didn’t know what to say. My friends and I didn’t respond because, honestly, what do you even say to something like that? She was practically yelling at us before storming out of the room.

Now here’s where I’m confused: after this whole thing, a bunch of people in class started acting weird toward us. Some even called us “insensitive” and accused us of flaunting our privilege, which is bizarre because none of them ever said anything before. I later found out that the girl is on financial aid and comes from a tough background, and yeah, that sucks, but is it really our fault? I SWEAR I wasn’t trying to brag. We were just talking about our vacation plans like anyone else would.

Look, it’s not like we don’t care about issues in Colombia. Of course we do. But is it so wrong to have a conversation about a trip without turning it into some political debate?

I’m really struggling to understand if we did something wrong by just talking about our trip, or if she was completely out of line for turning it into something else.

40,1fhhqlb,AITA for telling my friend her child's name was the same as a very prominent athlete? ,"

Two of my very close friends are expecting. The husband and I are both fans of the same NFL team, and they share the last name of a very prominent player. Yesterday was their baby shower and they announced both the gender and name - which was the first name of the player who they share a last name with. The two names are both very common, but put together I think a lot of people would at least recognize it as the players name. 

Afterwards I was chatting with my friend, and I complimented the name, saying it's ""like [nfl player]."" She said ""yeah, that'll be his name"" and didn't seem to be aware of the athlete whose name her child would share. I told her ""no, it's the same as one of the top quarterbacks in the NFL."" She seemed surprised but laughed and I thought it was odd but no big deal. 

Last night, after the shower I got a text from my other friend. He asked why I told his wife about the names origin, saying that if she didn't know I shouldn't have told her, and now she doesn't want to name the child after him. I told him that I assumed she knew about the player and didn't care. If she didn't know, I think she deserves to know that her child is sharing the name of a prominent person like that, especially when there's a good chance he was actually named after him. My friend is pissed at me and said I was meddling in his business.

(EDIT; My bf pays rent for the both of us. I have been staying with his oldest sister and my MIL for over 3 years now. I previously worked in childcare, but since finding out about my pregnancy my bf took over my half of rent and have decided I can be a SAHM.) 
I do house chores and clean up after everyone; most of the time no one cleans up after themselves so daily cleaning is a must. (EDIT: The cleaning I do consists of everything. I clean the bathroom, kitchen, living room, and dining room. From cleaning the shower and toilet, to vacuuming and mopping all areas of the house.

Now, his younger sister has two kids 3 and 6. They had moved in with us about a year ago when his sister separated from the kids dad. 
Since then his oldest sister, mom, and I have helped her babysit the kids. The issue is we are constantly watching them. I’m talking 5 days out of the week, for 5+ hours. It starts with her going to work around 3-4am. My MIL gets the kids ready for school and their father will pick them up for drop off. My SIL will occasionally pick them and when she’s home she’ll go in her room to nap for 2hrs+. When she wakes up she goes to the gym and will take her oldest, leaving behind her youngest. She’ll be at the gym for another 2hrs+. When she gets back she goes to her room and let her kids run around the house unsupervised until she deems bedtime; which can anywhere from 9-10pm.

42,1fhh9vu,AITA for convincing my parents to let me inherit the family business instead of my brother?,"I (26M) am the half-brother of ""Jake"" (29M), who has been considered the heir to our family business, an avian breedery, for as long as I can remember. Our parents have assumed that Jake would inherit it because he was the eldest. He's grown up presuming this, and he currently works at the breedery full time.

Here's where things get complicated: While Jake is talented and has a good rapport with customers and the birds, he's also been quite irresponsible in his personal life. He has a pattern of playing fast and loose with his health and finances, leading my parents to worry about his long-term ability to truly run the business. Despite this, he’s never been irresponsible with the business itself, and it’s clear that he loves it.

As our parents have gotten older, I began to notice their concerns about Jake’s lifestyle becoming more pronounced. They started discussing their plans for transferring the business to him and whether he’d be able to manage it all. After several family discussions, my parents admitted they were uncertain about Jake's ability to sustain the business in the long run due to his other issues.

During one of those conversations, I suggested that maybe I could take on more responsibility and learn the business, with the intention of making it a smoother transition for Jake and the company. My parents seemed to warm up to this idea, particularly since I’ve taken part in significant projects at the breedery, albeit part-time.

Over the next few months, I spoke to my parents more about how my vision for the breedery could help it grow and suggested implementing some changes that I felt could attract a broader audience. I think they found my energy refreshing, and finally, I managed to convince them to seriously consider passing the business on to me instead of Jake.

When I shared the news with Jake, he was devastated. He feels that he deserved the business since he’s dedicated his life to it and has been led to believe it would be his. He believes I’ve stepped in as a backstabber and that my parents are enabling me instead of trusting him. He argued pretty calmly - I think he was stunned - and then left. I haven't seen much of him for a week, but he's stopped partying and dressy flashy. It broke my heart to see him so crushed, as he’s genuinely passionate about the breedery - for all his many faults, he's been really dedicated towards it. It's the one thing he's responsible about. Also, while it's from our father's family, his mother helped run it and there's her touches all over it.

My parents seem to be on my side, but I can’t help but feel bad for Jake. I didn’t start this to hurt him, but I really believe it’s what’s best for the business's future.

Edit: if it's relevant, Jake has work experience from working here but would probably need to negotiate a better title if he wants to get a job somewhere else. He had a year of being at A&M for an Animal Science degree, but took a leave of absence and didn't return.

When I say he's reckless, I mean he goes out partying almost every night he isn't working, he's made out with every girl in the county lines, he's had numerous deeply unhealthy relationships, he's been drinking since HS, and he generally burns through his paycheck in two days. As careful as he is with the business, he's borderline self-destructive when he's having 'fun'. He doesn't use drugs, but I've had to ask, which isn't a great sign. He's loyal and a nice guy, but a mess I couldn't ethically recommend someone date, never mind run a company.

She is intelligent, kind, funny, compassionate, and loving. I am very lucky.

She also has an amazing figure, with a typical hourglass shape.

She usually dresses formally and conservatively for work (dress code), and in comfortable casuals around friends. Fitting or revealing clothes are generally for when it's just the two of us. I think she looks great in everything and never gave this much thought before.

We went to a pool party hosted by one of our common friends (F30). Most of us were wearing normal clothes during brunch and changed into swimwear after. 

The murmurs started soon as my wife stepped out in her bikini. Most of them were surprised but complementary, but our host and a group of her friends became noticeably colder from this point, with comments about how she's being attention seeking and vulgar. 

My wife wasn't wearing anything different from the other women - if anything, she was a little more covered up because she had a scarf around her waist and her bikini top was more like a regular brassiere. 

I was already pissed off, but because they were talking amongst themselves at this point I decided to just ignore it and not create a scene. 

When my wife took off her scarf thing to go into the pool though, our host yelled ""Oh COME ON"" and then said to her friend in a loud voice (50% of the people there could hear) that my wife is an ""attention whore"". 

I admit I lost my cool and yelled back at her that she was a jealous bitch and a terrible host. My wife and I left shortly after. 

Here's why I may be the asshole. 

1. It's been brought to my attention that ""attention-whore"" isn't literally calling someone a whore. I wouldn't have called her a bitch had I known this, but I still feel somewhat justified because whatever it means, it is still pretty offensive.

2. We were guests in her home. (This is my wife's main point... she thinks we should have just left and reduced our interaction with that group)

3. We were one of the only 3 indian families invited. There is an element of representing my whole ethnicity when we are in a mixed group that's very real. The other two indian couples are critical of me. The others (8 white couples, 1 black) found it funny / are mostly on my side. I am not counting our host and her friends that she was talking to. 

4. There were 4 children present (all under 13) and this is something I feel pretty shitty about too. They aren't the host's kids, and their parents brushed off my apology but I feel terrible about this part.

Basically, I stopped eating my mum's cooking because I had no way of knowing how much I was eating; macronutrient-wise. 

For context I have a part-time job so I pay for my own ingredients. Here come the issues: for one I need to manage my money so that I can pay for cooking expenses and save for my future. Another issue is that it’s time-consuming, not that I didn’t know that before, but with college having started I find myself not having enough time, but that’s its own issue.
 
Now for, the final issue, one I hadn’t accounted for and one I don’t know how to deal with: my mother. Let me make one thing clear: I love her. But, the issue I have is that she has repeatedly called me selfish for not cooking for her or letting her use my ingredients. Both issues which I wish I could solve, however, I simply can’t. For one, cooking for her would not only double my expenses but quadruple them as I live in a family of 4 and contrary to what my mum thinks, I’m not selfish and do care about others so I know that cooking for her would mean cooking for my brother and stepdad too, something I simply CANT do for three reasons: cost, time and space. Cost- expenses would quadruple and I’m already struggling to pay for myself. Time - it already takes me longer than it should to cook one portion let alone 4. Space- we simply don’t have pans or ovens big enough for 4 times the portions, lunch already takes up the biggest pan we have so cooking for them would be even more time-consuming. Despite me thinking these issues are obvious, my mum doesn’t share my vision and constantly bad-mouths me and tries to guilt trip me. I am more than ready to provide examples but can’t because of the character limit.

I am writing this because I genuinely don’t think I’m in the wrong. The way I see it, it’s not my responsibility to cook for her or even lend her anything but I still try to help when I can because I know we’re not doing the best financially, but despite my efforts she seems blind to my good and only focusses on what she finds wrong. I know I should tell this to her and not strangers on the internet but I doubt she would take it well so I’d  rather distance myself from her. But even then there would be problems, like her saying I don’t love her or I’m shunting her aside yet whenever I include her she kicks me away by being passive-aggressive or just outright rude.

For one, cooking for her would not only double my expenses but quadruple them as I live in a family of 4 and contrary to what my mum thinks, I’m not selfish and do care about others so I know that cooking for her would mean cooking for my brother and stepdad too, something I simply CANT do for three reasons: cost, time and space. Cost- expenses would quadruple and I’m already struggling to pay for myself. Time - it already takes me longer than it should to cook one portion let alone 4. Space- we simply don’t have pans or ovens big enough for 4 times the portions, lunch already takes up the biggest pan we have so cooking for them would be even more time-consuming. Despite me thinking these issues are obvious, my mum doesn’t share my vision and constantly bad-mouths me and tries to guilt trip me. I am more than ready to provide examples but can’t because of the character limit.

I am writing this because I genuinely don’t think I’m in the wrong. The way I see it, it’s not my responsibility to cook for her or even lend her anything but I still try to help when I can because I know we’re not doing the best financially, but despite my efforts she seems blind to my good and only focusses on what she finds wrong. I know I should tell this to her and not strangers on the internet but I doubt she would take it well so I’d  rather distance myself from her. But even then there would be problems, like her saying I don’t love her or I’m shunting her aside yet whenever I include her she kicks me away by being passive-aggressive or just outright rude. I don’t know what to do. I can’t talk to her, I can’t distance myself and I can’t try to approach her. Basically, I need your help and I need to know: am I the asshole?",3.0,0.0154110267758369,0,0
46,1fhgpgd,AITA for refusing to lie to my grandparents when my mom told me to and for backing my sister in refusing too?,"My sister (14f) and I (17m) lost our dad 10 years ago. At the time our dad had left mom and filed for divorce but he died before the divorce was finalized. They were divorcing over money. Mom was always bad at it. We had some money troubles, or mom did, because of her spending and it was always stuff for herself that she skipped bills to pay for. For this reason dad had set up an inheritance for us that mom could not touch. Our grandparents hold both of our inheritance and they have strict instructions on when they should and shouldn't allow some to be taken. If we need food, or one of us gets sick, or if there is something life changing that we really want. But my grandparents have the more detailed instructions.

Mom was always pissed dad didn't leave her in charge of the money. And she has tried to get a hold of some of it multiple times.

My mom is remarried now and made a blended family, but I don't really see any of them as family, even mom. Mom's spending is not much better now and she and her husband struggle sometimes and there are four other kids. Two are her husband's from before and two are her and her husband's kids. We're way better off than them. Even though in the house we technically have the same. We have more family, we have the inheritance and we know we'll have family help if we need it. And sometimes we have gotten money from the inheritance. My grandparents ask mom to provide proof of how much she needs to feed us and only us. She cannot say it's some amount for everyone. Even if the other kids had nothing, my grandparents only provide the money for us. My mom and her husband are pissed about this. They have accused my grandparents of being cruel and stuff before. My grandparents said they don't care. It's a huge fucking deal between them.

Lately my mom and her husband's money issues are worse and we're basically eating what comes from my grandparents or the inheritance. And yeah, my grandparents tried to get custody but this stuff wasn't enough to get custody of us, even though we both wanted it. My mom and her husband are pissed that the other kids are worse off. So mom told me and my sister that one of us needed to ask our grandparents for money, to lie and say we want it for something for us. I refused and when my sister refused I supported her and told mom she couldn't bully us into lying. Mom asked me if I'm really okay with four of my siblings being without. I shrugged in response. Mom tried to tell us again but the refusal stayed. She told me I was turning out to be as cruel as my grandparents.

47,1fhg9iw,AITA for scolding my son for using his disability as an excuse and telling him pick up his plate?,"My son (he’s 8) has cerebral palsy. One thing we taught him is never to look down on himself. While we recognize he has limitations, and we make accommodations for him, we make sure he knows he’s not defined by his disability and that his disability doesn’t make him lesser than anyone else. As he grows older, we try to teach him to be more independent, as much as someone his age should be.

He is 8 years old now. He’s a smart kid and usually gets the highest grades in his class. He is liked by all his teachers and classmates and has more friends than I ever had. I’m so proud of him. He is well-behaved both at home and at school.

But lately, he has started acting strange. I think it all started around 1.5 weeks ago. He started avoiding all his responsibilities. He used to make his own bed with our help, but now he’s refusing to do so. He stopped picking up his plates after dinner and started leaving his stuff around. I’m afraid he might also stop doing his homework because for the last two nights, he didn’t want to do it.

Whenever I confront him, he straight up says, ""I can’t, I’m disabled, I have Cerebral Palsy."" One time he even said, ""I can’t, I’m an R-word,"" and laughed. I was shocked. I told him not to use that word. I asked him if anyone told him that, and he said no. I told my wife, and we contacted his teachers, but he hasn’t told them anything either and he’s behaving well in school.

Last night, he didn’t pick up his plate after dinner again. I sat him down and told him to pick up his plate, and he screamed at me. He then again said he can’t because he’s disabled and useless.

My wife immediately started to comfort him with “no, you are not.” I was frustrated with him acting out. This time, I decided to be more direct and strict. I scolded him, saying that he’s only useless if he acts like he is. Then I said, “Now stop using your disability as an excuse and pick up your plate.” His eyes teared up, and my wife took him to his room. She thinks I’m an AH for scolding him and raising my voice at him. I didn’t even notice I raised my voice, but that’s what she says. AITA?

48,1fhg1dk,AITA for telling my friend she shouldn’t be hosting if her kid isn’t ready to be around people,"My friend has a 9 year old foster daughter. They’re homeschooling the girl because she gets overwhelmed around big groups of people and because she goes to other programs and services during the day. All of this means she doesn’t get many opportunities to be around other kids so my friend invited us and another family over and told us to bring our kids so her daughter could get used to being around other kids. Our kids are 12m, 10m, and 7f. The other kids were 11m and 8f. 

She tried but the place wasn’t set up very well for the kids. She had a little marble run set, magnatiles, board games, and coloring set up in the living room for the kids. Her daughter saw it and asked if those were her toys. My friend said no and that she got new ones for them to share with the other kids. Then she asked about the games and my friend said yes, those were their games. The girl picked up the boxes and took them to her room. My friend wasn’t able to talk her into sharing them and refused to tell her they were for everybody. 

The toys were also set up for younger kids so the boys started to get bored. I asked about turning on the tv and she told me that she can plug it in but she doesn’t have cable or streaming so the only things they can watch are whatever’s free on Roku or YouTube. We ended up sending the boys outside to play on her trampoline even though it was cold. 

Her daughter only colored with the girls when her mom was with her, then after 20 minutes she wanted to play by herself and locked herself in her room. 

She came out when dinner was ready and refused to sit with the other kids. There was pasta, chicken,  buttered noodles, and salad available but she still refused to eat any of it so her mom had to get up and make mac and cheese and dino nuggets just to get her to eat. After dinner she sat in her mom’s lap and refused to move until we went home. She was thanking us while we were leaving and saying this was great for her daughter. I told her that watching her kid get special treatment and take things away from them wasn’t good for the rest of the kids so she needs to wait until her daughter can be around people before she hosts again.

49,1fhftqb,AITA for wanting my landlady to evict my awful housemate? ,"I (21F) am a university student living in a share house near my university. The house has seven residents, including me, and while it has its maintenance issues, it’s the cheapest rent for such a good location. When I moved in, there was a housemate (30F) who had just finished her PhD and seemed fine initially.



Another housemate (30M), who lived next to her before moving out shortly after I arrived, refused to speak to her, despite speaking fluent English. I was confused by his behavior and tried to be understanding and respectful toward her out of pity.



At first, I felt sympathy for her when she shared how the other housemates didn’t respect her needs and her difficult circumstances. However, my sympathy waned as her requests became increasingly unreasonable and hypocritical. For example, she demanded we avoid the kitchen past 9-10 p.m. because she “had to get up at 5 a.m.,” but then she would be in the kitchen at 11 p.m. making noise herself.



She also asked me not to do laundry in the evening because she “could hear the machine,” while she had her own noisy automatic cycle that ran at night. She would complain about hygiene in the kitchen but left her vegetables out for days and food in her slow cooker unrefrigerated.



Her behavior extended to dramatic reactions about food smells and leaving the front door open unattended, even when there were visibly drunk homeless people outside. After a previous trespassing incident, we asked her to stop leaving the door open, citing safety concerns. She argued it was the only way to cool her room down and disregarded the security risk.



Despite being asked to move out by the landlady twice, she begged to stay, claiming she had “nowhere else to go.” She also didn’t have a job for a while but continued her disruptive behavior. This behavior led to many housemates moving out. My brother, who recently moved in, also has issues with her after living here for only a few months.



I’ve gathered photos of her misdeeds over the past few months to provide evidence for her eviction. However, my dad believes it’s unfair for me to report her given that she’s immunocompromised and can’t afford to live elsewhere. I think these reasons further justify her finding her own space or housemates who can tolerate her behaviour.

52,1fheu6t,AITA for ditching my friends on a beach trip after a local asked me out?,"Throwaway account and fake names because some people involve visit this subreddit regularly. 

This whole mess started back in 8th grade. I (19F) went to a school filled with spoiled rich kids. My group of friends (Sofia, Camila, Natalia, and Valeria) were inseparable, until everything blew up during a school trip to the beach, when we met him: Diego, a local guy, who was absolutely gorgeous. We were all giggling and crushing on him, but Diego only paid attention to Camila, or so we thought. He ended up asking ME to grab a bite with him at a local spot, and I said yes.

Camila was furious. She accused me of stealing Diego from her. She convinced Sofia and Valeria that I was a backstabber, and from that point on, my life at school became hell. They spread rumors about me being desperate and low-class for going out with a local. Only Natalia stuck by me, but she never really stood up to them.

Things got worse in high school. Camila started dating Andrés, a popular jock who was rich, homophobic, and a complete jerk. He used to make jokes about anyone he thought was beneath him, including me. But karma came for Andrés in the form of Sofia’s sweet, quiet boyfriend, Daniel. It turned out Andrés and Daniel had been secretly hooking up behind Camila’s back. 

When Sofia found out, she didn’t tell anyone right away. She waited until Camila threw a huge party after graduation. There, in front of everyone, Sofia revealed that Andrés had been cheating on Camila with her boyfriend. Camila lost it. She and Sofia got into a huge screaming match, calling each other fake, while Andrés just sat there and Daniel disappeared into the crowd. The entire friend group fractured that night.

By the time we started university, the tension was still thick. Camila couldn’t let go of Andrés cheating on her and made passive, aggressive comments every chance she got. Even though she had a new boyfriend, Rodrigo. Natalia tried to stay neutral as always, but it was exhausting.

Now comes the real kicker. We had another beach trip during our freshman year of college as part of our class reunion, and who do I run into? Diego, the same guy who started all this. He remembered me, and we started talking. And when he invited me to hang out with his friends, I decided to ditch my old group. I was done with the drama.

Camila saw us and flipped out. She accused me of ruining her life, saying I was the reason everything fell apart. She even took it out on Rodrigo, calling him soft for not understanding what it felt like to be betrayed. That’s when Rodrigo finally had enough. He stood up and broke up with her right then and there, telling her she was too obsessed with the past and needed to grow up. Andrés and Daniel, who were now openly together, just left the scene without a word.

So now I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for ditching my friends. Part of me feels guilty because we’ve known each other for years, but they’ve all been toxic.",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-15,"AITA for ditching my friends on a beach trip after a local asked me out? Throwaway account and fake names because some people involve visit this subreddit regularly. 

This whole mess started back in 8th grade. I (19F) went to a school filled with spoiled rich kids. My group of friends (Sofia, Camila, Natalia, and Valeria) were inseparable, until everything blew up during a school trip to the beach, when we met him: Diego, a local guy, who was absolutely gorgeous. We were all giggling and crushing on him, but Diego only paid attention to Camila, or so we thought. He ended up asking ME to grab a bite with him at a local spot, and I said yes.

Camila was furious. She accused me of stealing Diego from her. She convinced Sofia and Valeria that I was a backstabber, and from that point on, my life at school became hell. They spread rumors about me being desperate and low-class for going out with a local. Only Natalia stuck by me, but she never really stood up to them.

Things got worse in high school. Camila started dating Andrés, a popular jock who was rich, homophobic, and a complete jerk. He used to make jokes about anyone he thought was beneath him, including me. But karma came for Andrés in the form of Sofia’s sweet, quiet boyfriend, Daniel. It turned out Andrés and Daniel had been secretly hooking up behind Camila’s back. 

When Sofia found out, she didn’t tell anyone right away. She waited until Camila threw a huge party after graduation. There, in front of everyone, Sofia revealed that Andrés had been cheating on Camila with her boyfriend. Camila lost it. She and Sofia got into a huge screaming match, calling each other fake, while Andrés just sat there and Daniel disappeared into the crowd. The entire friend group fractured that night.

53,1fhebl6,AITA For Refusing to Get In The Middle of the Narcissistic Chaos between My Mom and Sister?,"I 58F am married and have two daughters, in their early 20’s.  Some six years ago, for reasons not pertinent to this post, I went VLC with my mother and three years later with my dad.  If you know anything about narcissism, it was warranted. 

I also have a sister 57F who has never been financially independent from my parents. She lived abroad for over 20 years, coming home every three or four years for a brief visit.  We were very close growing up but as she built her life abroad, she started to become erratic and we became somewhat distant.  

My sister returned from abroad during COVID,  moved in with my parents and refused to work. She claims that my parents couldn’t take care of themselves, so she had to.  Since then, she has been constantly at odds with my mother. My parents also told me that they had supported her almost the entire time she was abroad, including paying off her student loans, totaling over $250,000.  My dad, who was in his mid 80's, began to deteriorate, having several strokes, and he died two years ago. When he died, my sister engineered it so that none of us could see my dad, going so far as to give our names to hospital security. 

 Now, with my father no longer a buffer, my mom and sister argue non-stop.  While I am VLC with my mom, I have a rule that if she calls, I will always answer. Anything she asks, take her to the doctor, pick up an Rx, etc., I will do, she is just no longer allowed in our daily lives due to her narcissism.

Things between my mom and sister continue to escalate - they have called the police on each other five times.  My mom oscillates between telling me that my sister is a big help vs. wanting her out of the house.  My sister clearly suffers from a mental illness. She makes outrageous claims about people in the family, particularly me and believes that (I shit you not) Elvis, JFK, John Lennon and others are still alive, living in some bunker somewhere waiting to testify in a high court to secrets that only they were privy to, requiring them to fake their deaths, etc.

Yesterday, my mom called and the arguing between them was unbearable, my mom was yelling at her to go outside so we could have a conversation. When my sister realized it was me on the phone, she started screaming at me. Keep in mind, I have only seen her maybe three times since her return to the US. 

My dilemma?, In our state I can petition the courts to do an involuntary psych eval on my sister. This will get her out of the house and give my mom some peace, but I worry that my mom will feel guilty and let her back in. Then I am the target.  My sister has already threatened to call our employers, neighbors, etc.

So, AITA for leaving it alone, letting the two of them live in the chaos that they created,, while I distance us from the crazy? Or should I petition for a psych eval on my sister to hopefully nudge my mom to permanently get my sister out of the house so Mom can live the final years of her life in peace and quiet?

When my aunt finished first, she drove the car, waited in front of the phone shop, and called my mom to check when the phone repair would be completed, which took around five more minutes. Instead of picking up the phone, she told me to walk to the car to let my aunt know the finishing time. Although I did as I was told, I realized how imprudent it was to do so unthinkingly, especially under the heat. When I returned, I confronted my mom normally, asking why she wouldn't pick up the phone and tell my aunt herself. The shop owner even sided with me, questioning why my mom didn't pick up the phone. My mom responded that using a different service provider from my aunt would result in additional charges when she picked up the phone, even for a brief conversation. I found it hard to believe that a few seconds of talk would cost that much. Later, when we returned home, my mom scolded me for making things difficult for her.

56,1fhc5g2,AITA for expecting more from my friend in an offensive situation?,"So, here’s the situation. A friend of mine, let’s call him *Alex*, has a streaming account that he’s shared with a group of his friends, including me and my partner. We each have our own profiles under his account. Earlier today, I noticed that our profile—the one my partner and I use—had been renamed to “The Gays.” Neither of us made that change, and we were both really upset by it.

It’s not just about the words—it’s about the fact that someone with access to the account thought it was okay to rename our profile to something that mocks our sexuality. Naturally, I went to Alex, since it’s his account, and asked him to help figure out who did it. There are several people with access to the account, so I thought he’d want to help track down the culprit.

But Alex completely brushed it off. He told me to “get over it” and acted like I was overreacting. He even said *I* was being offensive for making a big deal out of it. He did ask one of the people with access if they were responsible, and when they said no, he just left it at that and said he wasn’t going to pursue it further. That’s it—one person denied it, and he dropped the whole thing. Meanwhile, I’m left feeling like my concerns don’t matter.

To make things worse, one of the people with access to the account has had beef with me in the past, so I can’t help but think they might be behind this. But Alex doesn’t seem interested in finding out the truth or taking any real action.

What frustrates me the most is that I feel like Alex would react differently if the situation were about someone else. If one of his other friends had their profile renamed to something racist, I think Alex would be outraged. But because it’s my profile, and the name is about my sexuality, he just doesn’t see it as a big deal.

I’ve done everything I can. I’ve tried to make him see why this is important, but he’s not willing to help or take this seriously. I’m drawing a line under it now, but I can’t help but feel hurt by how this has been handled.

I love him a lot, and never felt like marriage was the be all and end all.
But after a while I felt like I was giving him everything, so he didn't need to rush.
Well, he proposed on our anniversary with our children at home.
The sentiment was sweet, but I can't shake the feeling of disappointment in the day.
Aside from it already being our anniversary, nothing else was planned.
Which is fine. But my logic after the fact is that he knew he was going to propose so I one would think a little more effort would have gone into the day on his part.
When we first started dating he'd talk about how he's wanted to get married since he was young and that he would do a cool proposal. But as time went on we've just been getting by financially. So he hasn't been able to do the things he spoke about.
I've told him that the ring and extravaganza isn't what I want.
But somehow I feel like it wasn't even thought about beyond doing it.
I mean, after the proposal I suggested a day out with the kids and dinner. And we last minute got my parents to baby sit so we could celebrate the anniversary and engagement just the two of us.
But it was a joint plan, that I instigated.

58,1fhbnob,"AITA for ""complaining"" about a birthday gift?🙃🙃🙃 ","

Just to clarify at the beginning, I wont be mad if people decide that I am in the wrong, thats why I'm posting here.

Basically, yesterday was my birthday, and I decided to spend it with my boyfriend. I love him to the moon and back, and I had a great time with him. When it was time for him to give me his present, I opened the bag and I found some packs of candy and a birthday/love card. I had a dilemma, I wasn't sure should I keep quiet or not because I am aware that it is never a good thing to comment on anyone's gift, but as I am extremely honest and direct, I decided to tell him the thing that was bothering me.

When my family and friends gift each other(for Christmas or birthdays), we usually have a gift structure. That doesn't in any case mean spending a lot of money, it just means that it is usual to gift something to eat that the person likes, such as a pack of candy, a card and the ""main"" thing, such as, idk, a cosmetic thing like parfume or maybe lotion. 

Thats why I expected something like this, and I felt confused when I got his gift. His gift is, in my family, something you would give when you go to visit some guests. Nothing much, just something to give them, so not to come empty handed. I am by no means saying that I am not thankful for his gift. I feel blessed to have someone that even thought of my birthday and gave me something, and I verbalized that exact thing to him. 

The problem occured when I asked him what kind of gift-giving is normal in his family, and he told me that they dont gift each other that much, and that he thought that his present is just enough. I explained to him that I am by no means disappointed because of what he gave him, told him the truth, that I am very thankful for his gift and I really like it, but I was just confused because I wasnt aware of the differences in our opinions about gift-giving.

I feel terrible that I told him anything, because I know that he feels that he did not give enough (which is not true, he gave something in the way that he was used to), and he feels worried and sad. I want to know am I in the wrong for telling him anything. If I didnt tell him, I would feel sad because that gift, for me, symbolizes that we are not that close (of course, not true, we are very close, but because it was way different than what I was used to, I felt that way). And now that I told him, he feels sad. So idk what I was supposed to do, I never want to hurt him but I would also suffer if I didnt tell him anything.

To anyone who answers this, I am really not a spoiled brat that expects some expensive gifts, I just had a different opinion on how a gift for someone that close should look. And now I feel bad.

When I just told him no, he lost it. He just blamed me and said that if he hadn't outed me, our parents would still be taking care of him financially. Like, what??? This totally blindsided me, and now I don't know how to feel.

60,1fhb4zl,AITA for telling my friend's sister about her posting adult stuff online?,"A few months ago my boyfriend let me know that he found a reddit account that he thought looked similar to my best friend (Sarah), and he showed me some of the posts. I immediately knew it was her from her tattoos and a specific mole she's got, and her backgrounds were obviously her home. I was shocked as this wasn't something I ever imagined her doing and I thought we shared everything with each other. She said she had a work from home job taking calls for a company but never mentioned this. The posts were extreme, like penetration, ejaculation, full hardcore porn with her bf and with her face included.

Her reddit profile said her account was over 2 years old and I feel like I've been lied to this entire time. I texted her asking about it, and she confessed immediately. She said it wasn't any of my business and asked me why I was confronting her about it. I told her that lying to me about her job for years hurts, and that I had a right to know she's putting her naked body out there for my boyfriend to see. She said what my bf does is his business and that she has no idea who buys her stuff it's just business. She kept saying my problem should be with my bf looking at other women and not with her job. I thought she would have shown some understanding or cared about how I felt about this but she just brushed me off and told me she knew I wouldn't like her job because I'm not a sexually open person and insecure and that it wasn't my business to know about it. After we couldn't agree on this she stopped talking to me.

A few weeks ago I met Sarah's sister in a pub unintentionally, we were talking and she asked me why me and Sarah don't talk anymore. I told her about the reddit page and about her job, and the videos of her all over the internet. Her sister was shocked and said Sarah also told her about the fake work from home job. I offered to show her the posts/texts if she didn't believe me, she didn't want to see the pictures but asked me for the username. We didn't talk about it much more and went on with our nights.

A few days later I received a big message from Sarah saying I've betrayed her by telling her sister and her family have fallen out with her over her job. She said I tried to hurt her because I was angry at her job and none of them knew about it until I told them. I said it's not my fault if they don't like her job and she chose this line of work. I didn't intend to hurt her but I also don't feel like I need to lie to protect her after she lied to me? She didn't care about my boyfriend seeing it so why should I care about her family knowing about it? We couldn't agree on this again and we haven't spoke since.

So AITAH? I feel that I have been hurt by her lies but Sarah is now making herself the victim?

Ill name the smaller ones first:
I bought my dog a pretty pricey throwable dog toy that she's crazy about, my mom loses it, which can happen but i feel: she lost it, so she should find it or buy a new one. She focuses more on me not coming out when she called to search with her and says she's not gonna buy a new one.

The next 2 situations surround me going to Berlin for a weekend.

I loaned her my e-bike, which i rent, while i was gone. She locks it somewhere and loses the key.
I am highly dependent on my bike. For this she did pay the €50 fine but when there needed to be made an appointment to go out to the bike to receive a replacement she simply said she wasn't available and left it there. (I ended up going myself)

The last one is the big one:
On the way to and from the airport to go to Berlin i rented a share car, one if those you can just pickup and leave on the street. My mom drove and had to return it since i was gone.
When she returned it she parked the car in a electric car charging spot, the car is electric but she didn't plug it in causing it to get towed away.
The company charged €600 for this.
My moms reaction to this is that i have to share the cost of  this fine with her.
(For context she has rented these cars many times before, neither of us knew *this* would happen but she no stranger to them)

Those are this situations.
Now let me explain I'm not planning on not helping at all. i dont think i shouldn't help, especially with the car since she drove to help me,  but it's the way she automatically moves responsibility from her to me.
'she is Definitely not buying a new toy'
'she is unavailable at those times to meet with the  bicycle company, end of her involvement'
'I WILL share the car  fine with her' 

No smidge of these are her mistakes she should take primary responsibility, but that's how i see it

68,1fh8xda,AITA for keeping my late wife's money aside for my our children?,"I lost my late wife when our children were young. She had money that was hers (we had joint and separate finances). Anything that was her separate finances is being saved for our children. Where the question of this comes in is I have remarried and I have a stepchild and another biological child with my present wife. She was always aware that I consider this money for the children I had with my late wife only. But recently she feels it's unfair because they have money set aside for the future that will at least help get them started after they turn 18 while we sometimes had to make sacrifices due to inflation, etc. The latest thing was my stepdaughter wanted to join these dance classes that would help in her dream of professional dancing. We could not afford those specific dance classes. My wife was upset. She wanted to do this so badly for my stepdaughter. And for those who'll ask, the bio father is not in the picture and has not been found so he can pay child support and yes, he was searched for on more than one occasion but my wife has no idea where her ex is.

She wanted to know why there's money set aside for just two of the kids for their future instead of using it now to make our lives easier. I told her my late wife wanted this for them and I believe the money should be spent on my children with my late wife anyway. I told her we still had a good life. We just didn't have all the luxuries. And like a lot of families we struggled when inflation hit but we were still doing good.

My wife cannot access this money by the way and I know that will also be asked. I also have arrangements made in case something happens to me.

My wife then said that we could pay for extra curricular's for all four kids out of the money and have that off our minds and we could get back to saving, etc. I said no. She told me I'm acting like my late wife had left a will with instructions, which she didn't, and she also accused me of treating my stepdaughter and my youngest child like they are less deserving.

She told me I'm being very unreasonable.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-15,"AITA for keeping my late wife's money aside for my our children? I lost my late wife when our children were young. She had money that was hers (we had joint and separate finances). Anything that was her separate finances is being saved for our children. Where the question of this comes in is I have remarried and I have a stepchild and another biological child with my present wife. She was always aware that I consider this money for the children I had with my late wife only. But recently she feels it's unfair because they have money set aside for the future that will at least help get them started after they turn 18 while we sometimes had to make sacrifices due to inflation, etc. The latest thing was my stepdaughter wanted to join these dance classes that would help in her dream of professional dancing. We could not afford those specific dance classes. My wife was upset. She wanted to do this so badly for my stepdaughter. And for those who'll ask, the bio father is not in the picture and has not been found so he can pay child support and yes, he was searched for on more than one occasion but my wife has no idea where her ex is.

She wanted to know why there's money set aside for just two of the kids for their future instead of using it now to make our lives easier. I told her my late wife wanted this for them and I believe the money should be spent on my children with my late wife anyway. I told her we still had a good life. We just didn't have all the luxuries. And like a lot of families we struggled when inflation hit but we were still doing good.

My wife cannot access this money by the way and I know that will also be asked. I also have arrangements made in case something happens to me.

My wife then said that we could pay for extra curricular's for all four kids out of the money and have that off our minds and we could get back to saving, etc. I said no. She told me I'm acting like my late wife had left a will with instructions, which she didn't, and she also accused me of treating my stepdaughter and my youngest child like they are less deserving. I said the money is not mine. It was my late wife's and it will be our children's and that my wife should stop treating it as anything else.

She told me I'm being very unreasonable.

We went along just fine, he even added me and we chatted sometimes in private, but mainly in the group. Some dramas unfolded regarding people i knew, but they were solved at the end by dropping certain individuals and giving a lecture to others, as well as a second chance if deserved.

Perhaps this dude thought i was too kind, because after acting sweet towards me the entire time, i randomly found out he blocked me on both twitter and discord without saying anything. Since we were friends I was naturally worried, so I texted him and asked if he was comfortable to explain. He did, and said he didn't like how I handle situations or how I talk about them. He said I don't confront people properly, which I don't understand, since I'm always the one seeking others and even fighting them if it's necessary. Like... what does he know exactly about my private life? I don't do it sometimes in public because I'm not comfortable, but those are my boundaries. He said it fueled his lack of respect for me and ruined the vision he had.

Basically, I found out he's been uncomfortable with me since the START of the friendship. I thought we were good so it kinda upset me and made me feel self conscious. He dared assume how I felt in certain situations too by showing how twisted his vision of me is. Maybe he was figuring me out before deciding what to do (I respect his discomfort!) but he never faced me ONCE. Talk about lack of confrontation...

Not only that, but he's an artist. I'm a writer. My friend won a free commission from him and asked for a scene of my fic (she suggested it to me!). He gave us a pretty sketch, then months pass and he posts art, but the commission isn't anywhere to be seen. Me and my friend don't pressure him, until we find this out. And as much as I understand not wanting to do something related to me in any way, maybe speak with the client first? At least tell them before going radiosilence for months, while I thought everything was good?? She's the winner, and she's not me.

She refused and said she doesn't want to. I told her it would mean a lot and that I'd really appreciate it but she just said no and that I shouldn't be pressuring her into going. I asked why she wouldn't do one little thing for me that I want to do and she just said it doesn't interest her so she won't go. 

I told her there's been a lot of things that I've gone to for her that don't interest me but she expected me to go and I went because I knew it would make her happy so why won't she do the same thing for me.

She just said it was different but wouldn't explain how and said I should drop it and not try to get her to change her mind. I just told her you should want to do things for your partner that might not interest you since it would make your partner happy but she just said I was out of line.

71,1fh8k6j,AITA for getting angry and swearing at my mom when she parked in a handicapped spot?,"I (30M) recently decided to go back to college and earn a degree in computer science.

For some important background, I have very flat feet and wear insoles, and have always had some trouble walking long distances. About two years ago, I was in a bad car accident and broke my femur. My parents were strict with me regarding following the doctor's orders and not putting too much weight on my broken leg. For the first six months after the accident, I had a temporary disabled placard. When I was cleared to resume driving, I'll admit that being able to park in the handicapped spot made it much easier to get around the college campus, and meant that I didn't need to fight for a parking spot. Nonetheless, when my placard expired, my doctor said I didn't meet the qualifications to get another one. The whole experience made me really understand and appreciate the importance of needing these designated spaces.

Parking at my college is a big hassle and I often arrive extra early and circle the parking lot until I find an empty spot. Sometimes when it's convenient, my mom drives me to and from the college. About a week ago, when my mom was dropping me off, she pulled into a handicapped spot. I told her she shouldn't park there and she told me she was only going to be there for less than a minute while I got out of the car. She said she didn't see the big deal. I had other things to worry about so I got out of the car and went to my class. When she picked me up I was waiting at the curb near the loading zone.

A few days later she gave me a ride again and this time dropped me off near the loading zone but not in it. At the time, the handicapped spots were occupied. About five minutes before my class let out, she texted me and said she had arrived a bit early and was waiting for me. When I got to the parking lot, I saw that she was parked in the handicapped spot! When I got in the car, the first thing out of my mouth was ""What the f\*ck is wrong with you?!!"" She got mad at me for swearing and said it wasn't a big deal, as there were no cars in the other handicapped spaces. I apologized for swearing but told her she can't park there, and there were other empty, non-handicapped spots she could wait at as well as the loading zone. We argued and she again said it wasn't a big deal.

Today I asked her if she could give me a ride again, and she asked if I was going to swear at her again. I told her I wouldn't as long as she stayed out of the handicap spot. We argued some more before I decided just to drive myself. It was a hassle, but I managed. I don't understand why she's upset at me! Due to my experience with needing to park in the handicapped spot, I know why those spots are reserved, and don't understand why my mom can't respect this. AITA for getting angry and swearing?

72,1fh8i9t,AITA because I don't want my 11 yr son wearing shoe inserts to increase his height? ,"My son entered middle school this year. He seems to be having an ok time with it. He makes good grades and he gets along with lots of kids. To my knowledge, there's no one bullying him or giving him any significant issues. 

I got an alert from Walmart to my email. It was informing me one of the items I'd ordered was arriving late. My wife and I share a Walmart account and I was curious what she ordered that wasn't groceries. That's when I saw that it was inserts for shoes that would make a person appear taller.... 

I really assumed my account had been hacked or something. Didn't expect when i asked her about it that she'd tell me ""no, Noah asked me for them"" 

To me this is ridiculous. The next change I got, the 3 of us had a conversation about it. I tried to explain how I was worried about this for multiple reasons. First, he's not a short kid and I can't imagine he's having issues from his height. I told him I was concerned what it would mean for him in the long run. For his self esteem and the precedent it would set. I want him to be happy with his natural self. 

Another point I made was, ""if it's such a big deal and you think everyone is paying attention to your height, what do you think they'll say when you show up and have hit a 3"" growth spurt overnight"". 

Or what about if someone finds out about your height enhancers? They'd surely have something to say then. As I'm trying to give him logical considerations and convince him it's a bad idea for lots of reasons, his mother chimes in that she was one of the shortest in her class and she always hated it so she could understand and basically went against what I was trying to establish. 

Am I the asshole for getting frustrated with her that she would support this silly thing. In my mind, it's not only that she validated his concerns and destroyed the foundation I was laying for him not needing them. But also it's a terrible precedent to set imo.

My sister and I are pretty much the same size, although I’m growing more and will probably size up.   


Recently, throughout the year, I’ve been taking my dad’s clothes - with permission. At first it was because he has longsleeves and I needed some for going outside (my parents want me to cover my arms) and since I was younger I was against wearing longsleeves so I didn’t have any. Now, I do because it’s been months since.

But my dad’s clothes are comfy and big, so I still ‘steal’ some - aka, sending a text asking to take one with a picture of which shirt, and he usually says ok.

The issue is my sister also wants these clothes, except she doesn’t ask for any or say she wants any and just takes the ones I asked for without permission. I really, really hate it when people take things that are mine, ever since I was younger - aka, having a breakdown when someone sat in ‘my’ chair when I was 7-9-ish(?).

Recently -two weeks ago- my mom bought me my own laundry basket because prior, my sister and I shared the same laundry basket which is essentially how my sister would find my clothes and take them. So I sorted through all the baskets and took my clothes. I searched through her room (she has three baskets and clothes on the floor) for my clothes and found some I didn’t even know she took.

She unfortunately wore a shirt of mine after this and I got so sick of it, I dug through her dirty laundry basket to take it back and put it in mine because it irked me so much. I think I can slowly check through her clean laundry and make sure none of my clothes are in it and eventually I’ll get all my clothes back.

The real issue is that most of the clothes she’s taking is my dad’s clothes that I asked for. So I don’t know if it’s okay for me to tell her not to take it. I’m wearing my dad’s shirt right now, and she looked at me and said ‘oh, I want that one. I’ll just steal it later.’ Even though I said no. And then she said it’s funny how she’s the one stealing my clothes since usually it’s the younger sister stealing the older one’s clothes, not the other way around.

I (F/18) got invited to a classmate’s birthday party. She mentioned that there are no +1’s allowed since she’s trying to keep it a small circle and only her close friends. It was a small 12-person party. 

When I told my Boyfriend (M/20) about this Birthday party and that i’m not allowed to take him with me he said “If there are any boys at all, you leave. I will get mad, very. I’m serious”. Somehow i thought he was joking but I said “okay”.

Fast forward, I checked if any boys were coming. That friend has made a group chat and sent a poll in, asking who will be there. In that poll, i didn’t see any boys even voting or agreeing to coming, so i went. 

Surprise, a boy was there. Not any boy though, a fellow classmate of mine who i’m already with a lot of the time. So I thought “hey, he can’t be that mad right?”. I had no way home, a friend took me with her. And to be honest, i also didn’t want to leave. I was having a good time. The circumstances were pretty bad to tell him. Everyone was having a good time and my boyfriend was in a different city with his friends watching a soccer game. So i didn’t want to ruin the mood for the both of us. After a few hours i texted him, still while I was there. He got furious and told me to “leave him alone”. He then blocked me. 

Next day, I tried to call him and text him somewhere else. He said I disrespected him. I told him I didn’t know a boy would be there. I had no way home. I asked him what he wanted me to do? He just said “I don’t care anymore”. He then proceeded to say “You should’ve looked better, you could’ve asked her if there were any boys coming, you should’ve had an emergency plan if there were any guys”. I told him that I checked the poll she sent. He kept yelling “I don’t care about that stupid poll. I don’t care that you were too stupid to find out if there were any guys but THE FACT THAT YOU STILL STAYED. AND YOU DIDNT EVEN TEXT ME OR CALL ME. YOU DIDN’T GIVE A SINGLE SHIT ABOUT WHAT I SAID”. I just answered “…but I did text you? And you told me to leave you alone…”. 
“I blocked you”
“Oh you didn’t get my text?”

“I tried everything.”
“No you didn’t try everything. You didn’t fucking care.” 

But I did care. I checked if there would be any guys just for him. Because he said I’m not allowed to be there if there were any.

He eventually forgave me. That argument was 2 months ago. He forgave but didn’t actually understand. He broke up with me a few days ago because of something else but he said “it’s not just this reason it’s everything you’ve done”. He said this still bothered him.

He still sees this as a valid reason to break up, since I disrespected him and didn’t do what he said.",0.0,0.0442538112401962,0,1
75,1fh7qjq,AITA for ditching my boyfriend and ruining our plans?,"I have long distance bf for about 4-5 months now. We've seen each other irl, so it's not only an online hook up. We are really serious about being together, making future plans and ect. Anyway..

I am a single mom of 2 toddlers and i'm very busy most of the time. Life has been super chaotic the last year.

This week was very hard for me and my bf, but we made plans for friday night and saturday, which kept us going, surviving through the week. We could finally spend quality time together. Online, but still.

Thursday night we were on the phone until 3am - super late for me, because i get up at 7am. I said couple of times i have to go sleep, but the convo kept going. Maybe i shouldve been more firm. Friday was a struggle. By 23h i was craving bed. Bf got sad. He slept during the day so we have time for the night and told me i should try excersise, stretch, jump so i can freshen up. I did it and managed to stay awake until 3am. His plan was to stay awake the whole night so i said i will sleep for just 6 hours and then we can continue playing our online game together. He was really looking foreward my return.

I woke up and immediately called him. We spend 1 hour together. Then my sister called, said she is coming to town, asking if i wanna join the mall. I agreed right away. We barely see each other (few times a year) and i couldnt miss it. I had 30min for prep so i rushed to my bf ""Hey, i'm really sorry, but i have to go! My sister is visiting.. going to shower now.. talk to you later."" He said ""oh ok, see u later then"". While showering i felt really bad for how i just left, so i recorded a snapchat saying i'm sorry and i understand if he is upset, because i would be upset too if our plans got ruined out of nowhere. Said some comforting words and kept going with my plan. He didnt reply and i realized he is angry. I send another snap saying i know he is super mad at me rn and have the right to be, no judging. I would be mad too. But i can't miss the chance to see my sister and i really wanna do this.

He replied if i was really understanding i could just say ""no"". It was like i am beating him up, i know i hurt him, but i just keep going and saying sorry so i feel better. Said i don't put him as a priority, but as an option. I felt so hurt by this, because all i'm doing is juggling between my kids and him, using all of my free time, even compromizing my sleep so we can spend time. I basically don't have personal time. It's either the kids or him 90% of it. This really drains me, i feel completely exhausted. So i felt like he is overstepping a bit. He also said i don't keep him in the loop, he felt left out, he is perfectly okay for me to go, but at least i could ask, so he got the option to say something. I took that option away, by making the decision all by myself not considering his feelings at all. Everything went downhill from here..we spend the night fighting.

76,1fh7oxj,AITA for not letting my best friend borrow my car to go to therapy ,"My best friend and I moved together to a new province and lived together for two years starting in 2020. Because of the pandemic and the fact that we were both in a new province, we became quite codependent with each other. We were together every day after work, we made meals together and went on trips together. Overall, we made some great memories, but if I’m being honest, I was really tired by the end of it. She’s still my best friend, but during our time living together I took care of 95% of the cleaning, and let her use my car regularly to get to work. 

In 2021 I started noticing she would get jealous and start acting out when certain friends came to visit or with people I would casually date. Eventually, in 2022, I started dating someone seriously and things kind of exploded. I confronted her about her behaviour around people that were close to me and she admitted to it. After some fighting, some discussions and some break downs, she apologized and assured me that her jealousy had nothing to do with me, just an insecurity of hers. 

At the end of 2022 I ended up moving in with my partner, not fully because I was ready to, but because I was sick of doing all the cleaning, and her jealousy, while under control, was apparent at times. My boyfriend’s apartment didn’t have parking, so I made a deal with my friend that she would let me park my car at her house and she could use it if she needed it. 

She ended up using my car a lot more than I was comfortable with, but I let it go because she was paying the gas and oil changes. I paid for the insurance - she offered to pay for it a few times, but I was hesitant to because I already felt I had lost control of ownership my vehicle somehow. 

Now we’re in 2024 and the suite below my roommate (the house I lived before moving out) became available. My boyfriend and I moved into the suite below my best friend. 

When I moved back in, I told her that she wouldn’t be able to rely on my car anymore like she used to. She said that was fine, and it’s been fine until she asked me today if she could use it to get to therapy because it’s too far. 

It feels like it should be easy to do, but I’m struggling because I’m really trying to put boundaries down because of our codependent past. I don’t want to schedule things around her and have to communicate about the ins and outs of our schedule. 

I feel guilt because one of the reasons she’s in therapy is because I got really fed up with her binge drinking and told her I was worried about her. She chose to hide her binge drinking and start lying to me, which I get it because there’s a lot of substance abuse in her family - so I get it that it can be hard. When my friend has been black out drunk, she’s said mean things to me, she’s forgotten that her dad tried to touch me inappropriately while he was also binge drinking with her. I was really over it.  

I want to tell her she can use it until she joins a ride share. Am I an asshole?

78,1fh7jnn,AITA because I left my little stepsister alone with my parents because she is never there herself?,"Hi Reddit, I am f(17yo) my stepsister is f(16yo) and she is my stepfather's daughter.

She and I actually get along really well, but there is a problem. Normally she comes every three weeks for the weekend plus every other week of vacation. But now she hardly comes anymore and always looks for the worst excuses there are like: ""Oh right, my *mom* *forgot*"" or ""But my *mom* already arranged with *my grandma* that we go to her place, sorry!"" and more.

And now to the actual story:

I was at ski camp for a week and we weren't allowed to take cell phones with us and my sister then apparently spontaneously told my parents that she was coming back for the weekend to visit us.  The problem is I didn't know anything about it and had actually already made plans with friends for the weekend, but of course she had to decide *""spontaneously""*. If she had told me earlier I could have made changes to the plan, but when I told her she said she didn't know, which is a complete lie because I proudly told her at least 10 times. Anyway, I came home on Friday (the day she was coming) and told her what I had done, a little later my mother told me that my sister was coming to visit us. She also said that it was my decision whether I stayed or not. I decided to stay Friday and Saturday (around 12pm) to at least do something with her. But when I told her on Saturday that I was going to my father's, she suddenly became visibly angry and said to me that she was only coming because of me and that I would just leave. I then said to her that I would have stayed if she had told me and not decided spontaneously whether she would come or not after a hundred years!  She then called me an a-hole and started crying.

The only thing that made me not sure if I was not an a-hole after all is that her stepfather and her mother separated right after their wedding (a few days ago). She told me about it too, but since she always said that she hated her stepfather, I assumed it wasn't that bad. But my mother told me that she grew up with him anyway and misses him.

She got back earlier this week and was her birthday just after she got back. I asked to see her this Sunday to celebrate together and she asked if she could let me know when she wakes up on Sunday.

80,1fh6p8f,AITA for being a ‘b*tch’ when I went out with family?,"As of today, my mum (39f), my dad (39m), my two brothers (7m, 12m), and I (17f) had gone out shopping.

I never really go out with my family, as every time we do I end up in a bad mood, tired or in an altercation with someone. Which I do start sometimes. I only leave the house to hang out with friends, go to work, or go to school. Everything else like shopping, or needing to grab something, I get someone else to do for me. 

I don’t leave my room often, I feel like a familial outcast. I have no idea if it’s just me being a teenager, or if it’s the fact my mum consistently claims to be a ‘boy mum’, as I have four brothers, it makes me severely uncomfortable.

Anyways, today I had decided to go with them when shopping, because where they were going was a lengths away from where we lived. 

Throughout the duration of shopping, my mum was making snarky comments, about my work, about the fact I was going with them, just everything. She was putting me in a bad mood since I am a very sensitive person and I hate being criticised for small things.

When we got into the shop, I was walking down the aisle with my mum, and I got excited when I saw something I was looking for but hadn’t found until then. I started smiling and jumping on the balls of my feet, and she turned around and said ‘for gods sake, why can’t you ever act your age?’ It was completely unprovoked. This made me shut down and go so quiet. 

After that she got into a petty argument with me, telling me I was being a ‘sour puss’, that’s when I called out her attitude. She claimed ‘I’m your mum. I’m allowed to do that.’ And in response I turned around and said, ‘as a decent human, you wouldn’t.’

She got really mad at this and yelled at me, in front of everyone. She said I was being a b*tch and that if I kept going she would leave me there. That’s when I started to cry, which made her even more frustrated.

A while later, we moved to a food grocers, where she asked what I wanted for dinner. I told her what I wanted but the only option in that brand was something spicy. I settled for that, and mentioned something about sour cream. When I went looking for it, I was looking in the wrong place and went back saying I couldn’t find it. My mum got even more upset, saying I couldn’t do anything alone. I told her not to worry, already tired from the argument earlier. My dad, who was there the whole time told me ‘lose the attitude, stop arguing.’

That shocked me, because all I was doing was very little. They were mad at me for having an attitude, while my brothers were screwing around, wrestling each other, running into people and more. So now, leaving the shops and heading home, I’m in an even worse mood than before.

I could maybe understand where I may be the asshole for being in a bad mood over nothing, and I could have acted my age. It was just the way she doesn’t like me, at all.

83,1fh5bui,WIBTA if I vented to a friend about feeling excluded?,"For context, I (F13) am in a class with just 3 of my friends out of my entire friend group due to a teacher I had beef with for unrelated reasons. Recently, I've been feeling like there's a duo in a trio within that little group. My two friends (Both F13) have been telling each other secrets; this wouldn't be a big deal because it's not any of my business, but I know the topic of the secrets and they're still not telling me. They're all about a boy one of my friends (one of my two friends in the class) used to crush on. I can tell because they're using his code name, and I sometimes ask about it (but I have to tap my friend repeatedly for her to answer me). They make jokes, laugh, etc. without me, and even though that doesn't inherently upset me, the fact that I could be in the middle of a sentence and one of them starts talking and the other completely ignores me and listens to her does.

Last week, I was in one of my classes with them. The teacher said that we'd be doing a small pop quiz. My friends complained about it and said that they quickly needed to study, which I was basically already doing, so I paid no mind. I continued to study while they just goofed off and went on their devices. This made me feel excluded and annoyed, and I repeatedly warned them to start studying; they never did. One of my friends tried to put her hand on me, and I pushed it off (I know that was rude of me to do). I finished the pop quiz pretty quickly, and my friends were still doing it when I finished. I saw that they were getting some answers wrong, and I didn't help them. I'm still feeling a little guilty from that.

They continued to make me feel excluded throughout the next classes. And by break time, I just wanted to walk with my best friend and possibly tell her about what happened, but one of my friends from my class starts walking with us. It annoys me and I end up just sitting down away from them. My friend (from my class) asked if I was sad or upset; this also annoyed me.

I want to text my best friend and talk about what I've been feeling. I've been wanting to do it for a few days now, but I'm hesitating because there have been 2 instances where someone venting/talking bad about someone else in the friend group has gotten leaked. One ended up being pretty catastrophic, and the other was forgotten about. I'm even more hesitant because my friend group has talked about never talking bad about others and being toxicity-free. I just want to let my friend know what I'm feeling, but I don't want it to blow up in my face.

84,1fh4yv2,AITA for wanting my TV?,"When my partner and I started dating I’d always made it clear that her TV wasn’t good enough. My partner insisted they weren’t bothered and a top spec TV didn’t matter to them, eventually the one they had, the one I had complained so much about, simply died and my partner’s father offered us his spare. It was functional, but somehow worse, it had massive pixelated sections that would come and go or move across the screen, it’s audio would vary and it often had a picture/audio delay that made me want to weep. 

The Xmas after we moved in together my parents gifted us a very expensive TV. My partner insisted they didn’t want or need it. They failed to show any real gratitude to my parents for it but would then ‘show it off’ to any guest we had I. The following days and weeks. I had Sky fitted, again against their wishes but it was allowed because I added the extra expense to my share of our bill split and didn’t ask them for a contribution. 

Our relationship is over and I’ll leave the home with the clothes I own and none of the other furniture I’ve bought or brought with me. (Two sets of bedroom dressers, a king size bed and mattress and a wireless vacuum to list the most expensive things I have paid for personally and haven’t asked to take with me) I’ve also put lots of money into home improvements and decor, paid off debts they had before we even met, taken my partner and their children on holidays in the UK and abroad and provided for them and their children in ways their own father has refused to do so. 

So… AITA for asking to pay them half the value of the TV so I can take it with me? I literally have bugger all else and I’ll be paying the Sky bill for another 12 months.

My friend (N) and I have been friends for two years, mostly playing games together. Over the past few months, people started noticing that N was lying consistently, which led to them not trusting him. About 8 months ago, I was taking a break from a game we both play, and N asked to borrow some of my in-game items. I agreed but made it clear that it was a temporary loan. I even wrote down what I gave him, and he had 2FA on his account.



Six months later, I found out that N had sold my items and used the currency to buy other stuff. I confronted him, and he apologized, saying he thought I quit the game. I told him I might start playing again and would like my items or equivalent ones back. He agreed, and we left it at that.



A month later, I asked for the items back. I texted him in the morning, and after not hearing back all day, I had a mutual friend text him, and N replied immediately. He later responded to me, saying he didn’t have my items anymore. I suggested he sell some of his own items to repay me, but he dodged my texts for a few days. When he finally responded, he claimed he couldn’t send texts due to school Wi-Fi, which I knew was a lie because I’ve seen him text on it before.



N kept saying he thought I had quit and that it ""wasn't clear"" I wanted the items back. He even said ""I wouldn't lie to you OP"" and I responded that I wouldn't deal with his bs. I reminded him that I was clear 8 months ago, and I had even told him a month prior that I would want them back. N insisted he didn’t realize I was still playing and wouldn’t have sold my items if he knew.



After 2 weeks of no response, I sent a follow-up text and discovered he had unfriended me in the game. I decided to cut ties with him and told our mutual friends about the situation. N was upset, saying it was embarrassing that I turned this into a friendship issue and accused me of making people ""bitch"" at him. He also said, ""this shows how much you actually cared about the relationship."" I didn’t respond, and our conversation ended.

TLDR: I loaned my friend some in-game items, he sold them, and when I asked for them back, he dodged my texts, unfriended me, and blamed me for ruining the friendship.

88,1fh4ooa,WIBTA? I dont want to play DnD with the ball scratcher ,"Hi, I’m a 30 y.o F DnD player. I’ve been playing for about a year now and i absolutely love it. I play at a local small geek shop near my apartment and the people are amazing. I’ve been gone for about 2 months and came back today for my first game in a while. I was so exited, and most of the table where old faces. Out of the new players, i recognized a kid i have seen in the store but never played with before. He seems to be around 16. It started well but it was obvious the kid has autism and can not read social cues. He showed up with no dice, and i let him borrow one of my sets. He was ok, good player, all over the place with interupting and talking over people, but over all, things you kinda get used to. 
          Here is the thing. About an hour in to the game he starts plainly scratching his junk, sitting right next to me, he gets super exited and stands up two feet away from me scratching and pulling at his junk and im UNCOMFORTABLE. I still dont know if he was publicly playing with it or scratching avidly, or wtf was going on. I wanted to leave but I didn’t want to be rude af and leave with no explanation in the middle of the campaign, i have mad anxiety and no confrontation skills. Plus he’s a kid, and i didn’t want to bring it up and be like “yo stop scratching your junk!” So i pull up my folder next to my face trying to block my face from his avid scratching. 
         It was all guys over twenty on the table and no one said nothing but they where all visibly uncomfortable. I think we all know hes on the spectrum and non of us knew what to do or how to react to it. But this kid spent the next two and a half hours pulling scratching and grabbing his junk two feet away from me (my face basically as i was sitting down). When we finished the game, I told him to keep the dice i lent him since he didn’t have any, truth is, i did not want to touch them, but he told me he has dice, he just doesn’t want to loose them and left.  
         It took me a minute to gather the strength to pick up the dice with my bare hands after he spent like three hours touching his junk and my dice. I dont want to even go back, apparently hes been playing there for the past two months. So here is the thing, im talking to the owner about it, not just for me but for any female dnd player that comes, yes it seemed like he was scratching, but other times it seemed like he would get really exited and pull at his junk, hopefully they know his parents and talk to them and something happens.

89,1fh4k3p,AITA for wanting more effort from my husband on weekends?,"AITA for wanting more effort from my husband on weekends?

Throwaway account. Husband (M31) and I ‘F 29’ each work during the week. He is a teacher who works M-F, and I work part time and have a few side jobs that require me to work late and often part of the weekend. He gets home around 4 every day, whereas I’m home around 8. We both go to sleep around midnight.

He has several chronic health conditions that he manages very well. I won’t go into details, but they affect his energy and he is usually feeling not great when he comes home, so he rests until I come home so we can spend time together. Some are constant and will probably never go away, and others flare up periodically. He isn’t one of those people who “looks” sick, just kind of tired.

Here’s the problem: I am an energetic person who likes to go out. Not clubbing or anything crazy, but going to dinner, dancing, walking around our city, or other activities is something I want to do during the little free time I have. Obviously we don’t do this during the week, as he isn’t feeling good and I’m not even home until late, when I’m tired and just want to spend time with him. But on weekends, I want to go out! I feel like we’re wasting our most energetic years. He can sit on the couch for the entire weekend and barely move. He says he needs to recover from the week (which I understand, teachers go through a lot and his medical stuff), but I feel like a whole day of Netflix gets him enough rest to go out that night. 

He never even brings up the possibility of doing anything on weekends; it’s ALWAYS me, and lots of times he says he doesn’t want to or I can tell he’s not feeling up to it. I understand that sometimes he doesn’t want to, but I don’t want to always be the one suggesting things and then be rejected for whatever reason he comes up with. He’s also an introvert, which doesn’t help. The only time he ever wants to do anything is go outside in nature-like outdoorsy stuff. I tried to talk to him about it last night when he was in the middle of a chronic episode, but we both just got frustrated. AITA for wanting more effort from him?

Just want to add because I know how Reddit trolls are, this is just about putting in effort for plans. Nothing to do with our household or anything else.

James asked Robert if he could join too, to which Robert said no, saying James wouldn't mesh well. James asks again and Robert gives the same response. James then goes hard on Robert, saying he doesn't like the vague excuses, that he's an adult, and that Robert is disingenuous and inauthentic. Robert argues back with how condescending James is and trying to butt in on something he wasn't invited to is shitty. Robert has since blocked James.

I tried to remedy this mess by talking to them. Robert feels that James has not changed since middle school and that talking to him feels like walking on eggshells. He said no to James because these are his new college friends, and he wants to slowly introduce our friend groups by starting with me. On the other hand, James is mad that Robert has a history of vagueness, and decides to call him out on it finally. Overall, I felt that James' approach was too strong and that going harsh had the opposite effect if he wanted to be invited. Eventually, James did acknowledge that he was harsh, but started questioning why I didn't take his side.

**A bit of history.** Me and James have hanged out a lot over the past two years. We would sometimes eat together, talk about life, discuss our favorite anime, and often play billiards (he got me into the game). We've done a lot of things together, and we both enjoyed each other's company. He also doesn't mince his words. His convictions are strong, and he can be brutally honest, which I've usually got no issue with. Now, on the other hand, I barely hung out with Robert unless for group outings. Not because I don't like him, but just that he's never invited me for anything personally. His interests don't match mine or James' that much. Only recently did I meet up with him one-on-one, and that's when he invited me to meet his new friends.

We had a long talk, and eventually, James said it doesn't make sense why I value both of them equally when I've hung out with him more. I tried to explain to him that I value all my friends equally because that's just who I am as a person. He would also bring up his thoughts on why Robert is not a good person, including politics, which are pretty mild because no one is perfect. I tried to explain that I would value my friends equally above strangers, but he says that's not enough and wants someone who views him more than just another friend. I've explained that I've put in effort for our friendship too to make him happy, and he says I have no empathy. He says he feels betrayed and is reluctantly considering ending our friendship. He got pretty emotional and ended our talk by telling me to watch S12E22 of BBT and think about it. I didn't watch it yet.

91,1fh3z2h,AITA for supposedly damaging rental dvds and making my dad pay the fine?,"I live in south africa, yes video stores are still a thing here but  there's only a handful.

This happened a year ago, I heard my mom bring it up and talk about it with my aunt again recently. Both of them saying I was childish. At the time I was pretty set on thinking I was right but hearing my aunt say I was childish is what made me want to get second opinions.

I was 18 at the time and my best friend and I wanted to have a little movie day. My dad took us to the video store and let us choose movies and he rented it out on his name(he also paid for them as I did not work.) We had the movie date and all was good. Even after the movie day everyone in the house also watched the movies as I got both things for kids and things for adults.

Now let me give you the TV set up. We didn't have a TV stand yet so our TV was on a table in the lounge with the DVD right next to it. We would always put the rented DVDs right next to the DVD player for ease of acces.

I have 3 younger sisters who enjoyed my choice of animated movies and would watch them on repeat. The two older ones (9 and 11) knew how to handle DVDs and have always in the past just put on the rented DVDs by themselves.

One night I hear my dad screaming profanities from the lounge. I go in to find out that someone had spilled a big glass of water on the table and all the DVD covers were damaged. (There were 5 in total).  My younger sister(5) had spilled the water earlier that day and didn't tell anyone.

He turns to me and starts screaming about how I was careless and it was my responsibility to look after the dvds. I screamed back saying I didn't know it was damaged and wasn't the on who damaged it. He said that I was the one who got the dvd's for myself meaning that I would be paying the fine. I said no I'm not paying a fine.
This is how the screaming match went on for about 2 hours. He didn't once reprimand my sister or even tell her what she did was bad.

I admit that I could've kept the dvds in my room but we've always kept the DVDs on the table. Yes I know I got them out for myself but everyone including both my parents were watching the movies without me on top of it. I only watched them on my movie date.

He was also going on and on about how he was so nice as to pay for movies so I could have a good day with my friend and I just went and disrespected him like that.
Trying to guilt trip me. 

But financial guilt trip never works because he benefits every month from my biological father sending money + my pocket money. Even on Christmas/my bday when my bio dad sends me triple the amount to buy clothes and shit they take all that money and do God knows what with it. They never buy shit for me. Not even toiletries. I get all that from my grandma. Which is why I'm generally not bothered by them taking my pocket money. (She tends to spoil me)

I could've thrown this in his face but I chose not to cuz I was exhausted and didn't feel like arguing for another 5 hours

Edit: Perhaps I should've watched my sisters and checked if the movies were okay as he did rent out the movies for my best friend and I.

92,1fh3hn4,WIBTA for skipping my boyfriend’s graduation to go to a funeral?,"I (22F) have been with my boyfriend (21M) for just over a year. He graduates from uni next Tuesday and bought tickets for me and his immediate family and grandparents.

This morning, my family was told that my aunt passed away. She was sick for a while but she lived in another country so I only have childhood memories of her in our home country and I’ve talked with her over the phone a few times.

My mom and little sister are going to fly out to go to her funeral in a few days and I’d like to go with them. The plan is to go to the funeral in my aunt’s country and then travel to our home country for a while (where most of the family live and grew up) to stay with family.

I remember lots about my home country and the family there and I miss it a lot, which my boyfriend knows. He’s been having a rough time recently and I would feel bad about missing his graduation but I want to go to the funeral and I miss my home country and it’d be an expensive trip so this is likely my only chance in the next few years. If I go, there’s no chance I’d make it back for his graduation so it has to be one or the other.

WIBTA for going?


EDIT:
I just wanna clarify some things:

1. sorry i probably didn’t explain this well. my boyfriend and his family and myself and my immediate family live in country A so there’s no travel involved in going to the graduation. my family wasn’t invited, just me and he only bought a ticket to the ceremony for myself and his family. the funeral is in country B, which is a 30h flight away. my home country is country C and is next to country B so it’s very rare to be able to go visit.

2. i haven’t talked to my boyfriend yet so this isn’t an argument between us where he’s mad at me for not going. it’s just that i don’t want to do something that i think would upset him and hurt him, especially at the moment.

3. i do see myself staying with him long term and i know he feels the same.

4. i will talk to him about this but id like to know how i feel about the situation before doing so.

5. im not seeing this as a vacation, im seeing this as helping my mother through her grief and being for there in a time of need, as well as seeing my family that i never get to see because they live so far away as well as my home country which i do have a deep connection with and i miss greatly. i would regret missing out on visiting it but i need to think of my boyfriend’s feelings, not just mine

6. if the roles were reversed, id want him to go and not worry about missing my graduation. at the end of the day, its a celebration we already celebrated when he finished his last assignment and i wouldnt want him to miss out on such an important thing to be there for me, especially if i had all the support and family and friends that he has. i’m not trying to victimise myself but he has his entire extended families and tons of friends all close by and i only have my immediate family and him, which is a reason why i’d like to go and rekindle family relationships",No A-holes here,2024-09-15,"WIBTA for skipping my boyfriend’s graduation to go to a funeral?

93,1fh3crg,AITA for staying at the gym for 2 hours when my mom told me not to?,"So I (14M) started going to the gym 1 month ago. I work out (mostly) every other day but sometimes go 2 days in a row. This is pretty much the only physical exercise I get since I don't have gym class at school.

My mom has been going to the gym for the past 2 years on and off to lose weight. It has been unsuccessful, leading to her actually gaining over 15 pounds in that time. This is due to her uncontrollable eating habits and lack of consistency.

My results, on the other hand have been very encouraging. My body fat went down from 16.5 to 13.5 and I have visible abs now. I've also gained around 3-4 pounds of muscle and can lift significantly more than when I started.

This is because of HOW I work out. I make sure to use proper form, control the eccentric, and just push myself very hard. I eat enough protein and not too much fat. I also watch exercise content on youtube (RP and Jeff Nippard) to help me with form.

Due to the vigorous nature of my workouts, I spend a lot of time in the gym. Usually between 90-120 minutes. I do full-body as I'm still not sure of what split to do.

My mom thinks this is WAY too much and that I should go for less than 60 minutes (45 preferably). She usually goes to the 45 minute classes at her gym so she wants me to do something similar.

Her gym is professional and costs a lot and mine is small that we get with HOA. This is because she wants to “do it right”.

I have talked to her about this before, but she is adamant on giving me a reason why 60 mins is the max. I gave her my reasons mentioned above. I also really enjoy working out and it has been really good for my mental health. I just don't want to rush myself.

She just says it's too long and I'm just a kid.

Today she was really mad though. I went a little later today, 6:00-8:00, and it was dark by the time I got back. I probably would've stayed a bit longer but she kept calling me to come home.

When I got back, I was mad with her, since she does this every time. We had a big fight and I kept asking WHY I need to limit my time. Her response was, ""You're not an adult yet so you have to listen to me."" I responded by asking why I couldn't work out for longer again. She said, ""It doesn't matter, you should just follow what I say blindly."" At this point I was really frustrated and her argument made no sense. Then again, I CAN'T TELL HER THAT. I basically just stormed off and she said, ""You're so annoying lately"" and scoffed or something.

A theory I have is that my mom is just jealous I have better gains than her but it seems a little ridiculous.

So I'm still confused as to why I can't stay longer, and my dad (who uses logic) says I shouldn't work out for so long. He also didn't have a reason though and basically said he agrees with my mom.

We have an older model minivan obtained right before our second daughter was born. It needed lots of work but voila- some TLC later a good functional family minivan our daughters can ride comfortably in. The van has a feature that allows me to open the side door with a push of a button and close it with the pull of the latch. Super helpful when my hands are full. Tell me why he purposely deactivates the sliding door every time he happens to drive the van, or simply open the van. I have to manually push it open. Now this is an older model van so the door is heavy and awkward to open with no free hands. It can be done but why struggle with it when i dont have to.

95,1fh2w9q,AITA for contacting the partner of this random girl’s ex? ,"Hi, I thought it would be nice to get some outside opinions.

Around early August, I (28 F) was with my cousin Melody (21 F) and she was telling me about how her roommate Sophia and her long-distance friend Eve (both 21 F) were doing some social media snooping to get “justice” for this random girl. I was a little confused what my cousin meant but how she explained it, they thought this random girl was getting named dropped and talked shit about and took it upon themselves to contact her and “expose” her friends. And I guess it spiraled down from there? 

My cousin showed me screenshots from their group chat of Sophia’s convo with the girl (who we’ll call Anika) and it was honestly a little overwhelming for me. These girls turned this into some sort of conspiracy hunt and they went as far as looking into people associated with these “shit talkers.” And through “investigation” found out one of those friends was associated with Anika’s ex? And then from there it was just a lot of shit talking about the guy, his family, questioning how he even made friends and how it’s surprising he’s even with someone else. On paper it seems kind of harmless but looking at Sophia's conversation with Anika, I noticed Anika contradicted herself a lot and would backtrack if Sophia pointed it out. Also some of the stories she gave about her ex seemed believable at first but then they got silly. 

I asked my cousin why her friends gave Anika her ex’s new partner’s social media since Anika despised him. Melody said that it was for “exposure therapy” and that they thought it would make Anika feel happy to see if her ex got uglier. I didn’t know Anika and I don’t know her ex, but with my cousin showing me his current partner’s social media I felt bad for this person.

So I decided a week later to DM them after talking with Sophia. We decided to get another side of the story or potentially warn this person if it turns out what was said about Anika’s ex was true.

Turns out a lot of what Anika said was half-truths or even flat out twisted tales.

For example, Anika told Sophia about how her ex would try to “get” at her through her family and friends after their split. The current partner (Peach) asked if these “convos” happened to be about a couple months after their break-up. I sent the screenshots with Sophia’s approval and in the texts we noticed that Anika did mention that her ex contacted her best friend and mom a few months post-break up. Peach told me that while it was true that their bf contacted the two, it was for a personal matter unrelated to Anika and she was aware of that. I shared more screenshots of what she said and practically all of them were debunked with proof. 

I guess Sophia told Eve what we did and she blew up on her for not being a girls’ girl. Melody says it’s my fault that Eve is giving them both the silent treatment and I need to apologize. But Sophia told me that she realized they shouldn’t have snooped like that in the first place. So AITA for meddling?",Asshole,2024-09-15,"AITA for contacting the partner of this random girl’s ex?  Hi, I thought it would be nice to get some outside opinions.

Around early August, I (28 F) was with my cousin Melody (21 F) and she was telling me about how her roommate Sophia and her long-distance friend Eve (both 21 F) were doing some social media snooping to get “justice” for this random girl. I was a little confused what my cousin meant but how she explained it, they thought this random girl was getting named dropped and talked shit about and took it upon themselves to contact her and “expose” her friends. And I guess it spiraled down from there? 

My cousin showed me screenshots from their group chat of Sophia’s convo with the girl (who we’ll call Anika) and it was honestly a little overwhelming for me. These girls turned this into some sort of conspiracy hunt and they went as far as looking into people associated with these “shit talkers.” And through “investigation” found out one of those friends was associated with Anika’s ex? And then from there it was just a lot of shit talking about the guy, his family, questioning how he even made friends and how it’s surprising he’s even with someone else. On paper it seems kind of harmless but looking at Sophia's conversation with Anika, I noticed Anika contradicted herself a lot and would backtrack if Sophia pointed it out. Also some of the stories she gave about her ex seemed believable at first but then they got silly. 

I asked my cousin why her friends gave Anika her ex’s new partner’s social media since Anika despised him. Melody said that it was for “exposure therapy” and that they thought it would make Anika feel happy to see if her ex got uglier. I didn’t know Anika and I don’t know her ex, but with my cousin showing me his current partner’s social media I felt bad for this person.

96,1fh2rbt,"AITA for ""flaunting"" my boyfriend?","I'm gonna start this off by saying I do think I did stuff wrong and so did she but overall I just want feedback. So here are the people- I have a best friend Sally (nb) and a close friend Belle (f), along with Belle's crush Cassie (f) . I (f) and my boyfriend (m) started dating today, we've known each other for a while. My friend Cassie introduced us when she added him to a GC. Apparently she liked him but he didn't like her back because she's just not his kind of girl. I talked to him for two months as friends and we got really close since we have a lot in common and call every day. He recently asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes.

  
This is where the problem starts. Cassie didn't talk a lot to most of us but just mostly to Belle since they're best friends, and so when she talked in a GC with us all to my boyfriend in a flirty way, I said (literal quote) ""my boyfriend goes to sleep at like 2pm on a Tuesday \*tagged\*"". Cassie thought I was flaunting him and decided to make a group chat with Sally and Belle just shit talking me. Belle has a crush on Cassie so she agreed with her, but Sally called me and told me what was happening. I confronted Belle and Cassie in a group with all of us (except my boyfriend). I'm a naturally calm person so I essentially told Belle that if she's going to shit talk me I don't consider her my friend and told Cassie that she doesn't get to dictate who I date. She got mad and said he told her she was the light of his day (keep in mind he said this MONTHS ago) and said he was toxic and not good for me. I told her that isn't for her to decide and if he's toxic I'll figure that out myself. She got mad and said I was toxic for not agreeing with her (I guess?).

  
Me and Sally both were on the same side in this argument while Belle apologized (though I don't trust her now) and remains neutral. Cassie is the only one upset. I feel like maybe if I had originally been more kind to her feelings and not flaunted (her words, not mine but I understand where she's coming from) my boyfriend then none of this would have happened.

99,1fh2d35,AITA for making a comment about the stench of another roommate in going to my door?,"There are 4 of us that live in this house. Me & 2 other roomies were heading to my room to bring my printer to my room. 
The dude across the hall from me has been an odor issue since I moved in. Even my landlord apologized for the smell. That was almost a year ago.
I’ve tried to be kind in mentioning the smell in the past but he doesn't seem to do anything about it. I’ve cleaned the bathroom & kept it up, as that room is closer to the common areas of the house. When I first cleaned our bathroom, the stinky roomie threw a fit & slammed things in the bathroom. I gave it a little while, then went back into the bathroom to straighten it up. I didn't make any comments at this point. I wanted to see if it was just adjusting to sharing a bathroom. 
Things in regards to the bathroom settled down after that, but there was still a smell in the hallway. 
I like to have friends over to hang out. On many occasions my friends have pulled me aside to ask about the smell. My best friend has even mentioned it was weird, the smell is in the hallway outside my room but stops at my door. As we walked back to the living room to rejoin the group, I explained I thought it was the roomie across the hall from me as it was similar to the smell that had been in the bathroom when I first moved in. 
Over the past year the smell has slowly gotten worse. Certain things lead me to believe there may be hygiene issues, such as, he stopped using toilet paper in the bathroom.  Instead he’s used napkins, paper towels, & notebook paper. All of which he’s been flushing. When I found out, I informed my landlord in case we had a plumbing issue arise. Landlord said to let him know & he'd get it taken care of & talk to the stinky roomie. 
Within the past month the smell has expanded from the little hallway, between our rooms, into the common areas & even across the house, to the 4th roomie's room. Given that I had addressed the issue of the smell a few times over the past year, me & my other 2 roomies decided to reach out to the landlord on the matter, as it just seemed to get worse.
Before we could message our landlord, the hallway smell changed from a moldy, urine type smell to smelling like someone had dumped cologne or perfume in the hallway. It was not an improvement.
We immediately messaged the landlord & were informed he smelled it when he was there 2 days ago to pick up rent, & that he told stinky roomie to address the smell. Informed him of the cologne smell. He stated he would address it again. 
This brings us to the question, AITA. As we were heading to my room, I apologized for the smell. My 2 roomies told me not to apologize & as we were walking into my room, both of them triggered my Alexa saying “Alexa, please help w/the smell”. One quietly, & and one louder & laughing.

A few months ago I asked my friend group chat if anyone wanted to go see Charli XCX with me, only one friend responded (F17) who said that she would be down.

Since then I have planned two different trips with friends, one a day trip to a haunted house an hour or two outside the city and another overnight trip to Halloween Horror Nights in Florida, who I invited my best friend (F18), who I will call S, to. I let her know that she wouldn’t be going to the local haunted house with us because we didn’t have enough room to carpool and she’d already been invited to the expensive Halloween Horror Nights overnight trip (which I had paid for in its entirety including plane, hotel and park tickets.)

Now the friend that I invited to Charli XCX fell ill with Covid and I have a random new ticket to this concert that’s happening in a couple days. I asked my same friend group chat if anyone wanted to go and two people responded, (apparently she was more popular after her brat era) S and one of my other close friends, “M” (F17) who was going to the local haunted house. In order to cut down on ticket costs I decided to invite M instead of S for the sole reason that it meant I could uninvite her from the local haunted house trip to save on car space and ticket prices. Also logically S was already going on an extremely expensive paid trip with me to Florida so it felt like everyone would get to do one thing.

I decided it would be good to tell S all of this and she blew up at me, she said that it didn’t compute in her mind that I would choose M over her. She said that it didn’t matter about what i thought was fair that she was pissed (keep in mind I am paying for both Charli XCX and the entire Florida trip). After giving her time to cool off I decided to call her at which point she told me that she felt like I was treating her like a play thing and an object for acting like everything needs to be fair all the time. That she couldn’t move past her emotions and would not feel comfortable going to Florida with me. I’m now out several hundred dollars in haunted house, hotel, and flight tickets, because I didn’t invite her to Charli XCX over my other friend. I feel like I can’t ask her to pay me back since it would be crossing the line.

107,1fh0ybr,AITA for the argument with my mom for not letting me stay home for community college?,"Hello, 
I have a difficult relationship with my mom. We both have different views in life, and I have trauma because of many situations. 

I’ve been put in classes because of her, but not in the way you think. It’s more like, you at least cannot be at this level for ALL your classes. So I was forced to take gifted classes (not honors) instead of normal classes as a minimum. 

It’s not just that. My entire life I felt like I’ve been dictated for my parents, and now I’ve been recently outspoken against it. But every time we argue now, I can’t help but remind her of my past when I was a kid. Of what happened, and pointed out she ruined my life in a way. I’m not going into details, but basically once incident was so bad it involved the cops at a very young age. 

I want to feel better, I want to look forward to the future. But every time we argue I keep remembering what happened to me. It’s always in my head, and I wish I can be better. I know I’m wrong, but I don’t know how to stop. 

Anyway, we’ve been having arguments about community college. Yes my parents can pay for a 4-year college. They have the finance for it as, but I just can’t. If I do it, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life. I’ll just constantly remember that I could have gone to community college and save a shit-ton of money. I’ll always regret about it. 

Does that mean I sacrificed my life in high school for nothing, going into AP and Honor classes and sleepless nights? Yes. But does going to community college mean that I won’t regret for the rest of my life? Also yes. 

There’s this one particular community college I want to go. It’s close and I’ve been doing dual enrollment there. I’m very familiar with the coursework, and I’ve been spending my own money for it. But the problem is that there’s no dorms there. 

I found another community college that has dorms. But I don’t like the area, and the course requirements are different. That means I wasted some of my own money, from hundreds of money spent. And it’s at the county where I grew up in my childhood (bad). Also it was when those language classes were held and I was judged a lot by my peers when I was little. I really don’t want to go.

Me and my mom were arguing, and I promised I’ll go out for college and only come home to sleep and wake up early. That way they won’t see me. But they pointed out that I have to buy a car, and more importantly they don’t want me in the house. I don’t know why they don’t want me, but I think it’s because I have exposure to the “real world”? Idk. 

I only want to live in a house so that I don’t have to waste more money.

I pointed out that some credits won’t transfer as well. My mom yelled at me, saying that she don’t want me in the house and “so what”? I yelled back, saying that she ruined my life and she always controlled me. I remember glimpses of my childhood as well. She yelled back, saying I did too.

111,1fh0bzm,WIBTA if I told my friend she gaslighted me,"So today my friend sent a voice message basically confronting my lack of texting her. For a little context I am 19F and we’ve been friends for 2.5 years. I had been avoiding this conversation because it seems that every time I try to express my feelings with anyone I feel that it always blows back and it did that today too. Now I do have a tendency to withdrawl from people in hopes to find the words to say or that the relationship can just die. I feel that its passive aggressive and comes from anxiety and thats something that i’m trying to work on. This particular friend does this thing where in order to avoid confrontation with her mom she basically puts me on the spot so that blame can come down on the both of us. One particular time she did this was the day before my birthday in May of this year. Before she left from work she called me at 2:24pm to ask me if her and my other friend could stay the night, so asked my mom if she minds having company. My mom said she didn’t mind at all so I texted back at 2:26pm and said that it was fine. She calls be back and her mom is angry because she has a hair appointment and this is a last minute thing because she thinks up this whole thing the day before my birthday. Long story short her mom says outloud, “ you need to ask her and her mom if its ok for you to come,” and its just crickets. She says nothing, knowing that I already said it was fine, but I just said confirmed again anyway. I can see from a mile that it was from fear of the blowback and this is one of many situations thats equivalent. There is also this time in the mall on Christmas Eve where she invites me to the mall. I get to the mall and her new boyfriend is there so I’m at a shock cause I’m not expecting him. So I had to walk around the whole mall while he like rubs on her and hold her hand and i’m just the third wheel. I have the notes in my phone outlining the way thay I wanted to say it so that I can be respectful and say all the many things I didnt feel ok about. Well today when she sent the message she did the exact thing that I knew what happened and that I expected from her which was to get defensive. I even showed her the notes in my phone where I showed that I was just trying to find the best way to say everything and she completely bypassed it and said she no longer wanted to continue the friendship because I should have said everything sooner and that he whole situation happened because of my lack of communication.

I had been avoiding this conversation because it seems that every time I try to express my feelings with anyone I feel that it always blows back and it did that today too. Now I do have a tendency to withdrawl from people in hopes to find the words to say or that the relationship can just die. I feel that its passive aggressive and comes from anxiety and thats something that i’m trying to work on. This particular friend does this thing where in order to avoid confrontation with her mom she basically puts me on the spot so that blame can come down on the both of us. One particular time she did this was the day before my birthday in May of this year. Before she left from work she called me at 2:24pm to ask me if her and my other friend could stay the night, so asked my mom if she minds having company. My mom said she didn’t mind at all so I texted back at 2:26pm and said that it was fine. She calls be back and her mom is angry because she has a hair appointment and this is a last minute thing because she thinks up this whole thing the day before my birthday. Long story short her mom says outloud, “ you need to ask her and her mom if its ok for you to come,” and its just crickets. She says nothing, knowing that I already said it was fine, but I just said confirmed again anyway. I can see from a mile that it was from fear of the blowback and this is one of many situations thats equivalent. There is also this time in the mall on Christmas Eve where she invites me to the mall. I get to the mall and her new boyfriend is there so I’m at a shock cause I’m not expecting him. So I had to walk around the whole mall while he like rubs on her and hold her hand and i’m just the third wheel. I have the notes in my phone outlining the way thay I wanted to say it so that I can be respectful and say all the many things I didnt feel ok about. Well today when she sent the message she did the exact thing that I knew what happened and that I expected from her which was to get defensive. I even showed her the notes in my phone where I showed that I was just trying to find the best way to say everything and she completely bypassed it and said she no longer wanted to continue the friendship because I should have said everything sooner and that he whole situation happened because of my lack of communication.

112,1fh0bqw,AITAH for telling my bsf that it’s not my fault for the way she feels,Ok so my bsf 18f and I 17f had an argument a week ago. It started because she said that I’m a AH for kissing a guy she thought was cute and supposedly has had a crush on for sometime. I thought she was just acting jealous because she has a bf and it shouldn’t matter. But then she went off on a rant about how guys always choose me and how her bf had admitted to her drunkenly that he wished he could date me instead. She also said that I’ve always been the center of attention and I couldn’t once just let her have a guy to herself. I think this is crazy because it’s not my fault her boyfriend said that or that she is insecure. During her rant I told her this and I also I can’t help that people find me attractive. But that made her more mad and she ran out of the party crying. It’s been a week and her sisters and her have been commenting and texting me on social media calling me a home wrecker and a whore.

113,1fh00v9,AITA for wanting my own space. ,"
I am a 19-year-old female that moved back home after a semester at college in January. Since my dad travels a lot and is back-and-forth from where we live in California, and Florida, we need someone to watch the house since we have been robbed a couple times. So one of my dad’s friends, let’s call him Jad 50ish (M) has been staying at my house taking care of the place. Keep in mind Jad is basically homeless and lives out of a trailer with little family, he does have a daughter but she lives in Chile with her mom and the situation is sticky. Due to this his mental health is unstable and to try and help him out, my dad has let him stay at the house for about 2 years. Jad is helpful and I am appreciative of it, but since he has no job or responsibilities he is always in the house. He treats the house as it is his, always leaving the doors open, always walking around in the kitchen, common places, outside, wherever. He also lacks the social awareness of giving space when I am cooking in the kitchen or just doing school work in the living room, he is always trying to start a conversation I always engage because I feel bad but he usually drags on the conversation and I don’t know how to end it. It’s been so stressful having to hide from him and maneuver in a certain way so I don’t interact with him and I end up just not being home or stuck in my room. Also the fact that as a woman, I feel uncomfortable to wear comfortable clothes around him ie; mini shorts and a bra or a shirt for just lounging. It’s awkward to have an old man around regardless if he is trying to be creepy or not. Finally, I asked  my dad to please ask him to leave and he now has asked him to move on after 8 months and has even set up an alternative place for him to stay. I do feel bad though because he had been helpful and I don’t want him to think I didn’t appreciate it and I’m also scared he blames me for him leaving, which is sort of the case but at the same time I also feel like I literally cannot be at my house and comfortable it’s always like someone is lurking. Please tell me if I’m wrong for wanting to have my own space without this stranger. 

P.S While I was away on vacation just a couple months ago, an actual homeless man trespassed in my house and spent the night while Jad was there and the reason was because he didn’t lock the doors like he was supposed to. Then Jad played it off like he was the victim. The homeless guy went into my room and made a mess of everything and I can’t even imagine what I would do if I was there and a homeless man was standing over top of me just because Jad failed to lock the door.

114,1fgzrte,AITA for refusing to solve a problem in a board game the way my wife wanted me to?,"Hi Reddit,
&nbsp;  
The long and short of it is that my wife and I were playing a hobby board game (just a fancy term for board games that are a bit more complicated than the sorts of family games you may have grown up playing). The game has a lot of resources that are easy to lose track of, but provides a way to check yourself and set them to the right values, so often people check every now and again. The only other thing about the game that is relevant is that players alternate taking turns choosing tiles from a shared pool, and that the amount of a specific resource determines who goes first. We’d determined on a given round that she should go first, so she grabbed a tile, and then I went to choose mine, and as I decided on the one I wanted and placed it, she finished recounting her resources to verify them, and realized that actually I was the one who was supposed to go first this round. I said it’s an easy fix, and said “would you still want your piece if I were to just keep mine and say I grabbed it first?” she said “yes”, so I said, “great, so we’ll just say I went first and grabbed mine, you went and grabbed yours, and now it’s my turn again?”
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
This is where the fight begins, and where I lost the ability to follow her logic. She said “no, that’s not fair, you’re going twice in a row. Just go first next round”. I tried to explain that I wasn’t going twice in a row at all, we were just fixing the turn order for the round, and there’s no reason to artificially set who goes first in the next round as that could completely throw the game out of balance and we have a fix that doesn’t involve any work at all to implement sitting here in front of us.” The fight spiraled into her saying “it doesn’t fucking matter, it’s just a game. It’s a small thing, why can’t you just go with the flow and agree with me. You’re so inflexible. I don’t want to play anymore.” 
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
I felt after that like I’d somehow been put in a position where just trying to follow the rules of a game we both wanted to play was putting a trivial thing above my marriage, and if that’s what I’m doing, Reddit please slap me in the face with reality. From my point of view her “solution” made no game-theoretic sense, especially when the “problem” didn’t really require much of a solution at all. But I said I didn’t want to do her solution, because it could seriously throw off the balance of the game (in my favor) to just “lock me in” as first player for the next round needlessly. She said I obviously care more about games and being right then about our relationship, I retorted that that’s not true, and she said “Then prove it. Just go first next round like I said and I’ll come back.” That felt really manipulative to me, but she feels like I’m being manipulative and stubborn as well.

It's just for fun and she loved it and thought it was endearing when she was younger. Now that she's older, she doesn't like it as much. She just rolls her eyes or tells me to stop but she's never snapped until now.

I've been doing it more often because she's going off to college soon and I won't see her for a long time so I'm trying to make the most of our time together. I can tell she was getting more and more annoyed but never really thought much of it since she never outright snapped. Until yesterday.

I was talking to her about groceries and the phrase that set her off was ""Did you remember to get the snackie-snacks??"" Tina told me that she's ""told me so many times to stop and that she doesn't like when I talk like that."" I told her it's just for fun.

I, F18 became friends with Eric,M19 in 2020. He was friends with Melody,F17 & introduced us.We instantly became friends.They used to ""date"", but Eric always said it as a silly thing that happened when they were kids.

Melody & I hung out more & became closer. A month or so later, I had a tiny crush on Eric. I told her, & she urged me to pursue it. He heard through the grapevine. Long story short, he rejected me. No hard feelings on either side.

Later, she told me she had a crush on Eric.Didn't have any negative feelings about it, just surprised but supportive. 2021, she dated, Bruce M19. (long distance)

He visited & stayed with her for a week. I was surprised, as they had never met in person before. He was nice; tho they did a bit of PDA, Bruce & I became friends cause atp, they were together for a few months.

They had a MESSY break up.During 2022 & 2023, Melody had a few boyfriends.She never said the full story of why they'd broke up & I didn't want to badger her.

Sorry for the long backstory! Just giving context

2024, I hadn't seen them in a while (I'm a first year in uni;she's still in school). I saw through an Insta story that Melody & Eric were dating. It wasn't really secret, but stories posted previously could still gave ""friends"" impression. DM'ed them each, asking in a jokey tone ""since when were you two together?"".  He said ""Wasn't it obvious?"" & she said ""Since October."" I congratulated them & life went on.

On campus, I ran into Bruce. We still followed each other on Instagram & were civil. We spoke more & became friends. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal for Melody since she& Bruce broke up 3 years ago, & she's dating Eric. Anyway, I had this event coming up, & asked Bruce to be my date. He said yes. We went together as friends & had a good time. On our way back from the event, Bruce was drunk & he had my phone, was messaging Melody and called her.

Only realising after I dropped him off and went home, I sent her a message apologising & texted her ""Hey"" the next day, which she didn't respond to or read. Three weeks later, it's her birthday. It was during the week, so I was busy, but I posted a birthday message with a picture of her, on my insta story. I tried to tag her but couldn't find her account. Didn't think anything of it. I tagged her spam account, & again, went on with life.

A month later, Eric's sister posted on Insta & I noticed they hadn't seen Eric's posts in a while. Searched him and Melody on Instagram, & nothing. I call a friend and asks if he sees their accounts. He can. Shocked, I questioned why I were blocked. Bruce. I can't believe she's mad!

Am I in the wrong? I DID try to reach out to her after the situation happened, but she blocked me EVERYWHERE. Even got her boyfriend to block me. Didn't know she was upset with me for more than a month, & even so, I only realised through MY OWN digging.

120,1fhp31w,AITA: “Friend” got annoyed after I gave out to them for going into my house without permission ,"Ok, so for a little bit of context; throwaway account for obvious reasons. First off I live in company supplied housing, at the moment I live alone, and the other person lives in a different building than I do.

Basically the short is that in the company I work in we have new hires at certain times of the year, as a result we have people who move into the housings and may not be happy with their room which leads to them changing room or apartment. 

We have a recent new hire who wasn’t happy with their room so me and my friend had offered to show them rooms in each of our apartments, and we agreed that they would view their apartment first and then meet at my apartment. Things is that I was a little preoccupied away from my apartment at the time they arrived, so my friend thought it would be a good idea to use a spare set of keys without my permission to show the other rooms, as I returned they were leaving and I said to them that I was annoyed that they went into my apartment without my permission and they decided to throw a snide comment my way at the new hire, as a result I got very annoyed and sent them a strongly worded message. They in return called me an abuser and a terrible person to another one of our colleagues with whom I’m close with.

I’m still very annoyed at them 
but I just want an outside perspective if I’m overreacting or not

121,1fhp0em,AITA for Asking My Friend to Return My Nintendo Switch After They Haven't Made Payments?,"I let a friend borrow my Nintendo Switch about six months ago. They kept asking me to sell it to them, and I eventually agreed, setting up a payment plan. I was lenient with the terms, only asking for small payments of $5-$10 a week. However, it's been six months and they've only made two payments. The second payment came only after I sent them a message saying I needed them to either make another payment or return the Switch. 

In the message, I mentioned that I felt like they were taking advantage of my kindness and that I needed some form of regular payment to justify letting them keep it. I emphasized that I didn't want to upset them, but I needed to protect my own interests. Their response was that if I saw their bank statements, I'd understand they're not taking advantage, and they promised to make a payment that day.

I feel like I've been patient and understanding, but now I'm questioning if I'm being unreasonable by asking for the Switch back. Am I the asshole for wanting it returned until they can commit to paying for it properly? Also keep in mind in the beginning I didn’t want to sell it to him he just kept pestering.

122,1fhoxqn,AITA for not buying my niece perfume?,"So I, 33F, has a daughter, 12F, who has been begging me to buy a Sol de Janeiro mist, specifically the 68 scent. She already has the 62 scent in a small bottle and a few Bath and Body Works perfumes, mostly the vanilla and strawberry scent ones. She loves perfumes and body care a lot and since she was good for her first few weeks of school, I wanted to treat her to the 68 scent in the big bottle. 

So just yesterday, my sister came over with her own kid (35F and 10F) to my house. I told my sister that we were going to Sephora and she decided to come with us to buy my daughter the perfume. All 4 of us go there and my daughter is testing out the perfume she wants to buy. She eventually gets the perfume, plus a few serums. My sister went to a Bath and Body works sin the same shopping center, so after Sephora, I meet her there and she buys things for herself.

Here’s the thing with my niece. She gets rashes whenever a fragrance touches her body, so she’s really allergic. She always has to use hypoallergenic products like soaps and shampoos just because of how bad it is. As my sister is checking out at the Bath and Body Works, my niece gives her a few perfumes to buy, but my sister says to put them back because she is low on money (my sister was only buying a few hand sanitizers, so it wasn’t a big purchase for her). My niece starts crying because she can’t afford the perfume.

My sister whispers to me and asks if I can pay for the mists today and she’ll pay me back when she gets paid. I’m fine with paying for them but the thing is that I know about her allergy. So I tell her I won’t pay for it because she’s allergic. My sister rolls her eyes at me and pays for her hand sanitizers. She even shoves me out of the way and tells me she’ll uber home and doesn’t drive home with me. 

My conscience has been bothering me on my drive home with my daughter. I know my niece is allergic to perfumes but since she is a kid, I probably should’ve bought them anyway just to avoid future trouble. My sister made a huge deal about this and even told our brother who sides with her and doesn’t know about the allergy because he’s been distant in our child’s lives.

123,1fhotw4,AITA for telling my dad that a girl at school who is his friend's daughter changes her clothes at school.,"I (14M) am muslim and there is only one other muslim girl in my class. I was born here but she and her family moved here a few years ago.

Our parents know each other and have become quite friendly. Since this year, I noticed that she had started not wearing her hijab and sometimes would dress very differently in skirts and tops. I did not think much of it, but one day I got to school early and noticed she was already there in a hijab and then went to the toilets and came back without it and in a new set of clothes.

I am very close with my parents and tell them everything and talk to them openly about things. I casually mentioned this to my dad just in conversation and not in an accusatory done recently and did not think much of it.

But then my parents went and told hers and my dad said they are very angry with her and even considering going back to their country. They went through her room and computer and phone and found bad things including an anti god book called ""the god delusion"". As her family is very pious and cares about morals deeply, they are understandably upset.

I did not expect any of this and I feel like it is up to her to come around from this phase and I did not want to interfere.

However she is very upset with me and giving me dirty looks in school even though she has started wearing hijab again and she spoke to me the other day and called me 'an asshole who ruined her life'.
