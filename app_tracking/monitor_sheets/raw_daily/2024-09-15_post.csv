0,1fhgqpu,AITA for giving my friend a big tip? ,"Emily and I go to the same college. We have a bunch of classes together and we have become close over the years. 

She is trans and her parents have disowned her so she really struggles financially. She works a lot of hours in a cafe near our college. I often hang out with her there when the cafe is not busy. 

She has been really struggling to get by and I wanted to do something nice for her and so I left a nice tip (around 200 dollars) and she stopped me from leaving and gave it back and said she doesn't need it. She looked very very upset. She has been avoiding me the whole week and doesn't sit with me 

I feel like an idiot. I really didn't mean to offend her. It is not a lot of money and she is really struggling and I thought I would do something nice for her and suprise her but it backfired. She seemed so crushed when she handed me back the money.

1,1fhar9x,UPDATE: AITA for telling my co-worker that I didn't enjoy my pregnancy?,"Since posting, I have kept my distance from Linda as recommended by commenters, which has been tough because our work often overlaps and, yâ€™know, weâ€™re in the same team. Since then, I noticed she has snapped at other coworkers as well. I figured that commenters were right â€“ that now her probation was over, the nice-girl act was over.

Â Things were awkward.

Â Then, I heard her crying in the bathroom. I didnâ€™t want to get involved in case it caused another fight, but I also couldnâ€™t just leave her there when there might be a problem, so I told â€˜Tinaâ€™, our team lead, who then went to check on Linda. A while later, Tina came back and said she had sent Linda home as she wasnâ€™t feeling well.

Â A few days later, Linda came back to work. She asked to speak to me. Alone. It probably wasnâ€™t the best idea, but I agreed to. And Iâ€™m glad I did.

Â Linda apologised for how she snapped at me. I asked why she excluded me from ladies night. She said she didnâ€™t invite me to the ladies night because I had told her I didnâ€™t like them. To be fair I have a vague memory of this coming up in conversation a while ago. But she had something else to tell me.

Â It turns out, some of you were right. Linda is pregnant. When she got sent home, her boyfriend asked her to take a pregnancy test because the last time she was pregnant, she got super broody, and her mood was all over the place - being happy one minute, bursting into tear the next, then being super irritable. As bad as she was being at work, she was even worse at home. She took a test and, yep, sheâ€™s pregnant.

Â She told me she wanted me to be the first person in the office to know about it. I guess it was her way of apologising?

Â I accepted her apology and chose to believe her about the ladies night, albeit cautiously. Iâ€™m still keeping a slight guard up, because who knows, for all I know this is a some game sheâ€™s playing, but for now, I am choosing to take her at her word.

Â Obviously, her being pregnant doesnâ€™t excuse how she spoke to me, but it does explain it, and if that genuinely is the issue, then hopefully that means the issue is solved.",UPDATE,2024-09-15,"UPDATE: AITA for telling my co-worker that I didn't enjoy my pregnancy?
