0,1fi5t3t,AITA for painting my son‚Äôs nails?,"I coparent my 5 year old son with his father. His father grew up in a conservative religious household but not longer practices as an adult. 

Yesterday, I was painting my nails as I normally do while our son was watching the movie Cars, a new recent love of his.

He was instantly overjoyed to have red on him like Lightning McQueen. He was so, so happy and excited and wanted to show his daddy and his friends at school tomorrow. I texted a picture to his dad and asked if he could wear the nail polish to school for one day to show his friends. His dad responded ‚ÄúNo, take this off immediately. We need to show him that some things are for boys and some things are just for girls.‚Äù

I told him I didn‚Äôt agree that this was a big deal but would take off the nail polish, and that if he had strong feelings about this, we should talk in person and not over text. I worked in a school setting for four years and saw many male teachers and students with nail polish, and I let his dad know that nail polish is pretty normalized between all genders nowadays. He accused me of ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù our son and asked if I was going to refer to our son as nonbinary? I let him know I felt this was being blown out of proportion.

Am I the a**hole? He and I are meeting this week. We have had a contentious coparenting relationship in the past and are struggling to regain trust.

I am providing an update, because I think that the people here were right and my wording wasn't the best. So I decided to apologize to my daughter, tell her that I regret saying what I said to her, and that I should have spoken to her in different words, explained the situation to her differently. And that I'm sorry that my words upset her and I should . She told me that she isn't mad or angry at us, that it's not our fault for feeling the way we do. She told us that it is what it is and she's just going to have to live with being what she is. I told her that that's a very mature view, and that I'm proud of her. No matter what might have happened in the past, she is here with us now and we love her and I'm glad she can understand that.

As a reward for being so mature, I ordered her some sushi, her favorite food :) She's still a bit quiet, but I think with some more weeks she's going to get over it and be just fine. I'm thankful for the people here, even if some people were a bit harsh, that they made me realize how unfortunate my wording had been.

4,1figxoy,AITA for not inviting my best friend to my wedding? ,"So as the title says, my (28M) closest friend from high school (28M) is not invited to my wedding. The reason for this is nuanced, but the main reason is because he is an alcoholic that has been in and out of treatment over the last year and a half. I also want to make it clear this post in not about how I should handle his addiction and I have done everything in my power to help and be on his side.

My friend's first time out of rehab I was cautiously optimistic that he was going to get things together and put it behind him, he was very down and never seemed like himself, but I assumed he was just adjusting to sober life and I was very supportive. About a month later, we hosted our engagement party at a local vineyard, and made it clear that he did not have to attend if he did not feel comfortable. However, he ended up showing up and was casually drinking as if everything was okay. I did not make a scene in the moment, but in the following days I let him know I would have to say something to his family out of respect to them and his recent history. He obviously took this very personally and told me how bad of a friend I was and how he wanted me out of his life. Admittedly, I did say some things I regret that I had been holding onto for a few years. After that, he was in and out of treatment for the next year or so, but we did not speak much outside of a few phone calls when he was sober.

During this year of not really speaking when he was in and out of treatment, we were planning for our wedding. We are having a smaller (50 guests), less traditional wedding in Hawaii. The guest list was tight with her family being big, and we had to cut some friends that we did not necessarily want to, although the travel considerations made some of those choices easier.

So, my friend is not getting invited because we did not feel like we could trust him to be sober at the time of our wedding and felt it would be best to leave him out for everyone's sake. It will not be a dry wedding, so that also felt like it could be a potential issue. I assumed he might understand and see where we were coming from, however very recently he and I had been talking more and he finally asked me about the wedding. At first he was sad but he seemed to understand due to everything mentioned above. However, one day after I asked him for a favor (a very simple one), he went off on me about the wedding. He feels as though we should have saved a spot for him no matter what and that this showed him how I truly felt about our friendship. He has once again asked me to stay out of his life and said our friendship will never be the same.

I know I do not need to answer to anyone about who I do and do not invite to my wedding, and nothing about this decision will change, but I am curious to know how others feel about this.

So, naturally, I‚Äôve always assumed I‚Äôd pay for his college under the condition that he major in something that would set him up for success. STEM or Econ, specifically.

But recently, my son keeps insisting he wants to major in marketing or public relations instead and go into the sports marketing field. He says that STEM and Econ would make him miserable, and I know he‚Äôs struggled with math and science all throughout school. I‚Äôve even found him crying over his homework a few times. I get that he finds these subjects difficult, but I really think if he tried a little harder, he could find a field within STEM that works for him. He spends so much time playing basketball with his friends instead of focusing on his studies, and it feels like he‚Äôs just not putting in the effort.

I've had some advantages they didn't--economically stable (but far from wealthy) parents, no student loans, etc. But my spouse spends a LOT more.

Over the years I have loaned my spouse tens of thousands of dollars. This includes 20K at once to pay off their student loans, along with 4K earlier this year for a car repair. 

This is on top of thousands more they owe our joint bank account, which we had agreed to pay into equally to cover the mortgage, utilities, medical bills, house repairs, federal taxes owed, etc. It's also in addition to tens of thousands more they owe me after massive personal purchases (mostly clothes) on our old joint credit card, which we had agreed would be used for household purchases only. I paid that off and closed it a few years ago.

In case it's relevant, my spouse is being treated for long-standing clinical depression.

Recently they experienced  discrimination at work and now plan to hire a lawyer. I offered to lend them money. They responded ""That's not love"" -- as if I should just offer to pay outright. since they know I have money saved.

8,1fiftov,AITAH for not meeting up with my best friend ,"

I (17f) have been friends w my best friend for a few years now, so far we never had any problems (barely had fights etc.) and even said we were each others soul mates at one point.
Earlier this year I got together with my boyfriend, we are long distance (8 hours apart) so I had to wait for like 3 months for us to meet up in person for the first time. 

During the week where my boyfriend visited me she finished her written exams and asked me to meet up to celebrate with her. I told her that I‚Äôm really sorry that I can‚Äôt meet up with her that week because I wasn‚Äôt sure when I was gonna see my boyfriend again so I wanted to make as much of the time we had together as possible.
I met up with her the week after and she told me how her sister and parents now didn‚Äôt like me anymore because ‚Äûher boyfriend is more important to her than her best friend‚Äú. She didn‚Äôt defend me in front of her parents and worded things in a way that make me look like the biggest asshole ever when the situation is completely different.(Keep in mind that for all of the years of our friendship, I never canceled on her and was late maybe 3 times).

I (17f) have been friends w my best friend for a few years now, so far we never had any problems (barely had fights etc.) and even said we were each others soul mates at one point.
Earlier this year I got together with my boyfriend, we are long distance (8 hours apart) so I had to wait for like 3 months for us to meet up in person for the first time. 

During the week where my boyfriend visited me she finished her written exams and asked me to meet up to celebrate with her. I told her that I‚Äôm really sorry that I can‚Äôt meet up with her that week because I wasn‚Äôt sure when I was gonna see my boyfriend again so I wanted to make as much of the time we had together as possible.
I met up with her the week after and she told me how her sister and parents now didn‚Äôt like me anymore because ‚Äûher boyfriend is more important to her than her best friend‚Äú. She didn‚Äôt defend me in front of her parents and worded things in a way that make me look like the biggest asshole ever when the situation is completely different.(Keep in mind that for all of the years of our friendship, I never canceled on her and was late maybe 3 times).

Even when I wanted to end it due to my relationship anxiety he was a rock and believed we could work this out. He has never at least raised his voice at me.
From about a week now things have been different. He experienced some power outages. After the childhood trauma he has been unable to stay with lights turned off. Before meeting me he had nightmares of what happened and he heard voices almost everyday when he‚Äôs alone since he was like 12. And now it‚Äôs back again. But now after this he has nightmares every single day. He says he also hears voices. He has mentioned about this only briefly before but he said the nightmares and voices stopped just after he met me.
We are long distance. He is very different now. He gets very mad with his mom and other people. I suggested going to a doctor but he says he has to stabilize himself first or otherwise because of the anger he has, he will get angry with the doctor when he has to talk about that trauma again and says he can‚Äôt bear to talk about it at the state he‚Äôs in.

For backstory my bridesmaid Lucy (F22) and I (F21) were supposed to grow up together because our parents were friends but they moved away when we were little. We reconnected, and Lucy planned to move closer to me to attend school so our friendship grew even more. Her dad passed away unexpectedly right after we graduated, and I was there for her every step of the way, no matter what she needed I was there, but at the same time I knew her dad, but not well (this is important later). Flash forward 3 years, and I‚Äôm getting married to my high school sweetheart, Lucy was of course asked to be a bridesmaid because she is one of my best friends, my maid of honor is my little cousin Maggie (18). Now Maggie and I were inseparable as kids. My aunt and uncle treated me like their own, I was always at their house, went on family trips with them, my uncle even taught me how to ride a bike because my driveway at home was too rough we remained close our whole lives. I always told with my fianc√© that if my father passed away then my Uncle (Maggie‚Äôs dad) would walk me down the aisle. Well, a few months ago my uncle passed away in a tragic accident. Our family is still absolutely devastated. I planned a bachelorette trip for my bridesmaids and I which seemed like a great opportunity for me and Maggie especially to let loose and have fun. I asked my dad to drive. Lucy had made comments to my dad about how she wishes her dad was here with us to give him someone to hang out with, as the night wore on the comments had gotten more frequent. She said things such as man if my dad could see his second daughter getting married, then she started talking about saving him a seat at the wedding (which I had no problem with) however, Maggie was starting to feel uncomfortable. As the night wore on, the comments worsened Finally Lucy she said, I know he (Lucy‚Äôs dad) is going to be on your other arm, walking you down the aisle for your wedding day I took one look at Maggie, and we both started crying. Maggie and I had each gotten tattoos with her dad‚Äôs nicknames for us on our wrists, and when we got them we had talked about how he‚Äôd be with us on both of our wedding days. After this I had enough of Lucy‚Äôs comments as my dad was comforting Maggie, I pulled Lucy aside I told her I understand she misses him, but she needs to stop talking like I was super close to her dad, I told her I wasn‚Äôt, the man who was like a second father to me just died, and it‚Äôs still hard to think, or talk about him. I told her the last thing I wanted for Maggie tonight is for her to get upset, and not be able to enjoy herself. I told her that we just wanted to have a fun night, and forget our loss, but she won‚Äôt stop making it all about her. Lucy took an Uber, went home, and me and the rest of the bridesmaids still went out and had a good time even Maggie.

12,1fie6wy,AITA for fulfilling my daughter's birthday wish?? ,"My daughter's sweet 16th birthday is this Thursday. She told me several months ago that what she wants more than anything, is to see her family together, celebrating her big day. What a sweetheart, right!? Yesterday, she reiterated the same sentiment with some additional clarity: she wants to invite her bio-mom too.  (B.M.)  She said this to me with tears pooling up in her eyes. 

Honestly, I didn't even consider that she wanted B.M. there until she said it yesterday because, well,  B.M. is a total POS. She has not been in my daughter's life since she was 3 yrs old; when she told her, ""I never wanted to be a mother"", and left. Since then, she has let my daughter down so much. It breaks my heart to think about how this and her absence in general has effected my daughter.  B.M. has never offered any support to us or thanked me for raising her. She just calls once or twice a year and then showers my daughter with gifts, in an attempt to buy her love and ease her guilt. But my daughter has seen right through this crap for most of her teen years. She still loves her BM and I will never keep her from talking to her BM when she wants to. 

There is so much more I won't get in to regarding B.M. Just know that my daughter has learned over time that she can not rely on her or expect her to follow through with any promises she makes. We are doing just fine without her, thank you very much. 

When she said she wanted her BM to be at her party, I thought about it and decided I could put my feelings aside and give her this birthday wish.  We both know the chances her mom will show up are about 5% and my daughter said she doesn't care.  She wants to invite her anyway. 

So I told her it should be OK but let me talk to my GF, who has been more of a mother figure than BM for the time we've been together.  I have to give her credit for that before going any further.  

It hasn't been all roses, though.  My GF is stubborn and can be down right cold, especially towards my daughter. So I run it by her and wow, I wasn't expecting her response. She is telling me that I'm ""choosing bio mom over her"" and refuses now to participate in any way with my daughter's birthday.  This especially sucks because I need her help with the surprise we have planned for my daughter and now I don't know what I'm going to do.  There's absolutely no reason my GF and I can't be in the same room as BM for a half hour so my daughter gets her 1 birthday wish.  BM will likely not show up so why is my GF being this way?  Her last text to me was, ""I don't want anything to do with your spoiled brat daughter anymore, so leave me out of it!""   

I want to be clear-  I have so many reasons to hate BM and I never, ever wanted her to be at my daughter's party. But this is my daughter's wish and I think I can put aside my feelings toward her to let my daughter have her wish.  Afterall, she only turns 16 once.

We've been friends for about 2 years now. The other day K sent tons of messages on the group chat saying she felt under-appreciated, that she didn't believe we really care about her and we just use her. This isn't at all true, we both really love her and were really startled when she said this. My other friend L replied very quickly saying she was sorry and would try and appreciate her more and that she genuinely meant a lot to her. I sent one message saying I did appreciate her, but that was before L responded and I sent no further messages after that.

16,1ficyea,AITA for refusing to change my unborn daughters name?,"For context my brother 34 (M) and his girlfriend 28 (F) have been together for 8months and my brother has admitted it‚Äôs already getting a bit rocky and he‚Äôs debating leaving her. 

After a few months of trying me 27 (F) and my husband 28 (M)  are pregnant with our first baby. I am 20 weeks along and have been very unsure about a name for our baby girl until 2 weeks ago, at first we were hesitant about being public about the name as I know disagreements can occur. I wont lie its a pretty basic name but its his late grandmothers name and a name I had always liked so we went with it. 

Just a bit more context my husband lost his mum at 8 years old and his father was never really present so his grandmother became his caregiver and a massive part in his life, we started dating at 14 & 15 and from the start I was open about my home life not being the best and she welcomed me in her home whenever i needed. She was also a massive part in my life and helped me get through my abusive parents (now on better terms) and bullying so we always had a good relationship so this wasn‚Äôt just a name I was going with for my husband we both loved the idea of our baby girl to take the name of her great-grandmother and to wear it in honour of her. 

After we announced the name my brothers girlfriend flipped, she stated that was her late daughters name (from a different man, not my brother so I had no idea that was her name, my brother just informed us her daughter had passed last year and to be careful on those sorts of topics around her but the name was never brought up.) She immediately demanded we changed the name and said the baby wouldn‚Äôt care, i explained it was also in honour of husband‚Äôs late grandmother and it had real meaning to us and we didn‚Äôt want to change it but she insisted she couldn‚Äôt hear her daughters name, especially not on another child.

 I understand it must be so hard but the name has meaning to us and if I‚Äôm being honest if she was genuinely apart of my family, i may have considered but my brother wasn‚Äôt sure if they were forever. I offered for them to come up with a nickname we use around her if she desperately didn‚Äôt want to hear the name but she refused and said she doesn‚Äôt care about who‚Äôs grandmother is dead, she had it coming but her daughter still had her whole life ahead of her and called me an inconsiderate cow. 

My brother broke up with her on the spot and now all my friends are saying i took it too far but I really don‚Äôt see how. So AITA? 

Edit: Some people believe this story is fake due to me including my friends randomly at the end but these 3 girls were my close‚Äôs friends and we have very similar opinions and have alway told each other everything.

She, her husband and young child recently came to visit me. Here‚Äôs the problem. I had moved from a big city  to a rural area 2 hours away since she last visited me. When she was planning the trip, I informed her of a couple of smaller airports that were closer to my new house. She booked flights without consulting with me, but texted me the flight details so I could pick them up from the airport. I saw she had booked her flight to the major airport where I used to live. I kindly suggested that they rent a car. 

Our visit started off fine, but I could tell something was eating at her. At one point when we were alone, I asked her what was going on, assuming it was an issue with her husband. She went off on me about how rude it was that I didn‚Äôt pick the up at the airport, how she hated the car, how expensive it wa, how the shuttle to the rental car center was very inconvenient, etc. I was stunned and didn‚Äôt know what to say.

A little background info: I (39F) have a dear friend since high school. I moved across the country 15 years ago but we have kept in touch and visited each other several times. 

She, her husband and young child recently came to visit me. Here‚Äôs the problem. I had moved from a big city  to a rural area 2 hours away since she last visited me. When she was planning the trip, I informed her of a couple of smaller airports that were closer to my new house. She booked flights without consulting with me, but texted me the flight details so I could pick them up from the airport. I saw she had booked her flight to the major airport where I used to live. I kindly suggested that they rent a car. 

Our visit started off fine, but I could tell something was eating at her. At one point when we were alone, I asked her what was going on, assuming it was an issue with her husband. She went off on me about how rude it was that I didn‚Äôt pick the up at the airport, how she hated the car, how expensive it wa, how the shuttle to the rental car center was very inconvenient, etc. I was stunned and didn‚Äôt know what to say.

23,1fic19f,AITA for telling my son to share his birthday gifts with his brothers after he shared it with his half brother?,"My son Dylan had his 15th birthday on Friday.

Otherwise he eats well.

I have two other kids who are 7 and 11. I also have a 20yo son from my 1st marriage (Matt). Matt came down yesterday with his girlfriend to take Dylan ax throwing as a present. They came back and hung out abd Dylan gave half the snacks he got to Matt to take back to college. He gave him a jar of licorice, Oreos, Sour Pouch Kids (which should be banned), Cinnamon Toast Crunch, chips. 

This morning, my 7 and 11 asked Dylan if they could take some of his M&Ms to school and he said no. They asked why and he said he was going to give it away at school. I told Dylan it makes no sense to ask for all that junk food just to give it away but not giving any to all of your brothers. Like no sense. Just give them a bag. Remember that they're sharing a bedroom so you can have your own. He got mad at me for telling me what to do with his birthday gifts and that his mom wouldn't do that. I asked why do you think your stepdad is on Ozempic?

If you're going to give away your shit then give it to everyone.

24,1fibys4,AITA for mentioning that I fly to another city to get my nails done and making everyone thing I‚Äôm some spoiled brat?,"Ok, so this happened a few days ago, and I feel kinda weird about it. I (19F) am originally from a small city in Brazil called Florian√≥polis in the state of Santa Catarina but have been studying in S√£o Pablo for about a year now. I‚Äôve made a few friends at my college, but I‚Äôm still getting used to the differences, coming from a small town to the enormity of S√£o Pablo, and sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt realize how things come across here.

The other day, I was talking to a few classmates after class. We were just chatting about random stuff, and the topic of nails came up. Someone mentioned a local salon, and I mentioned that I fly back to Florian√≥polis every few months to get my nails done by a specific lady who‚Äôs been doing them for years. I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time; it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve always done, and I guess it just felt normal to me because a lot of my high school friends studying in other cities also fly back home for random stuff.¬†

But as soon as I said it, the whole vibe of the group changed. A couple of people kinda laughed awkwardly, and one girl just straight up asked, ‚ÄúWait, you fly to Santa Catarina for your nails?‚Äù I said yes and explained that it‚Äôs just something I‚Äôve always done, and it‚Äôs just about an hour flight, so it‚Äôs not a huge deal.

After that, the conversation felt a bit tense. Later, one of my closer friends (who was there) texted me and said that I came off as super bratty and like a tone-deaf bitch because most of our classmates work part time jobs just to afford school and basic stuff, and here I am casually talking about flying to another state for a manicure. I honestly didn‚Äôt mean for it to come off like that, and now I feel kinda shitty.

I get that not everyone can do stuff like that, but I didn‚Äôt think I was bragging or anything. Now I‚Äôm worried that everyone thinks I‚Äôm some spoiled rich girl who‚Äôs out of touch with reality. I‚Äôm wondering if I really did screw up and if I should apologize to the group, or if I‚Äôm overthinking this whole thing.

EDIT: Ok, I realize I should clarify a few things because I think the way I worded it in the makes it sound weird.

When I fly to Florian√≥polis, it‚Äôs not like I just arrive, get them done, and fly right back. I usually go during long weekends or breaks from school so I can spend a few days there with my family. It‚Äôs kind of a chance to see everyone and catch up and yeah, I‚Äôll also get my nails done while I‚Äôm there but of course I do other stuff too.

I‚Äôd be lying if I said getting my nails done isn‚Äôt a big motivation, because the lady who does them has been doing them for years and honestly makes them look gorgeous. But I‚Äôm not flying back just for nails and leaving after a few hours. Also, between these trips I usually do my own nails or leave them untouched.

My mother takes care of me almost every day, if it's not arranging my appointments, it is taking care of me in a certain sense (I ask her a lot for help as a mediator at certain times, I can always call her fall into complete utter panic, but she also literally cuts my nails, helps me tie up my hair and so on) In short, just for context, I ask a lot from my mother in both attention and physical help and she repeatedly comes to me 1 or 2 times in a row to go to appointments together, such as the GP, psychologist etc. I know that she has it very difficult handling this and that is why we always do our best to reduce it, but they can't really stop completely because I have no one else to do it for me, even despite me living in a group home.

Now the point of discussion: my mother therefore sometimes goes on holiday alone to really let go and enjoy the peace.

At the same time she says that she feels very sad for me, but that this is the harsh reality that I have to be able to accept because I cannot hinder others in their holidays, they also deserve peace and quiet and fun together without me being difficult about being excluded.

Anyway, 10 years passed and things are cool. I like my family, my parents didn‚Äôt get with any crazy stepparents or whatever. My dad‚Äôs ex was pretty chill, and my mom was engaged to this cool, funny guy, but they broke up a while ago. 

So the other night, my parents called me and my siblings for dinner, which isn‚Äôt that weird for us. Dinner was fine, but afterward, they sat us down in the living room and said they wanted to talk. They started with saying we‚Äôre gonna do family therapy, and I was like, what? We don‚Äôt have any issues. Then the real problem dropped, my mom is pregnant with my dad‚Äôs baby AGAIN.

My brother and sister thought it was cool to get another sibling, didn‚Äôt ask too many questions. I was shocked though, like, they‚Äôve been divorced for YEARS, I‚Äôve been going back and forth between houses, and now they‚Äôre having another baby??

I asked if they‚Äôre getting back together, and they were like‚Äùwe‚Äôre still figuring things out.‚Äù I lost it. I yelled at them, said their relationship is ridiculous, and it‚Äôs gross to have another kid when they don‚Äôt even know what they‚Äôre doing. My mom started crying and left the room, my brother started crying too 'cause he can‚Äôt stand seeing people upset, and my dad and sister were calming him down. My dad was obviously mad, but all he said was to go to my room and chill out, that I should think before I speak.

Now I feel confused. I said what I thought, but I didn‚Äôt want to make my mom cry. She‚Äôs a great mom and I love her a lot. This all happened last night, and my dad‚Äôs been taking care of the house and us today, but I think my mom‚Äôs been in her room. I haven‚Äôt had the guts to talk to my dad or siblings yet.

30,1fiaueg,AITA for asking for another room?,"AITA for not wanting to share a room with my cousin

All names changed. 

My (35) sibling (31) got married recently at a hotel about 40 minutes away from where they and the parental units on both sides live. Our mother organized rooms for the couple's parents and me - I live in a different country all together - to stay after the party. No problem, I appreciated not having to drive the parents back early in the morning (I don't drink).
The grandparents all left the party early for home, with a taxi service provided by the couple, including my one grandmother (A) who actually lives in that town.

Our uncle lives in yet another country and was also invited, together with our cousin (24). 
Uncle and his (surprise) partner stayed with grandmother A, his mother, the whole time and declined a room at the hotel, also leaving early. 

My mother told me the day before the wedding that she expected me to share the room at the hotel with my cousin. Wasn't an issue until the morning off, when I found out there was just one double bed.

Now, I love my cousin, but I really hate sleeping in the same bed with other people. Doesn't matter who. I don't get any sleep. So I asked if we could change the room to one with 2 beds. 
My mother exploded on me. Fair enough, she's stressed because it's the morning of the wedding, but she really went off on me. Screaming and everything. 
So I told her it's fine, I'll make do. (I couldn't change the room myself as she had booked it, plus we found out there was another wedding and the last free rooms were not affordable for me.)

Then, my cousin also objected. She said she'd just go to Grandma's place, too, no worries. She is even more against sharing a bed than I am. 

And again my mother exploded. But somehow instead of talking to my cousin, she put it all on me. How ungrateful and spoiled and selfish we are. How she spent money on the room. How dare we reject or argue. 

In the end, cousin and I both shared the bed, neither of us getting any sleep (not too bad, it was only about 3 hours between end of party and breakfast anyway), but my mother is STILL bringing it up every now and then when we facetime, commenting on how I stressed her out for nothing and how I should know better at my age. 

(Sibling and partner had no idea btw, I think they might have heard about it by now, with my mom being so ""passionate"" about it even to other people, but they weren't involved on the day itself.)

I admit the timing wasn't the best but was I the asshole asking for a different room at all?

33,1fia7mh,AITA for not getting my best friend a birthday gift?,"Hi! So, my bsf just recently turned 16 and I didn't get her a birthday gift. 

Usually I would make a huge effort for someone's birthday if I'm someone close with you, like a hand drawn/ watercolour flower card and a box of chocolates, and because I put some work into it, I expect at least something back - even if it is something small, i'm grateful because you thought about me, which I find sweet. 

For the last 2 years, i've done this for my bsf, going out of my way to make sure I get things that she wants specifically, even it is it expensive but within my budget, i'll get it for her because at the end of the day, she's my friend and we've been close for quite some time. 

However, like I said in the beginning, if I put some effort into something, i'd at least expect something back but both these times, she didn't get me anything either of those times, not even saying happy birthday with that also.

For context, both of us are muslim and we don't celebrate birthdays, but regardless I enjoy making things for others because it's the way i show my affection.

On her birthday, I always say to her ""happy not birthday"" as a joke (because like i said, we can't celebrate it) and give her the gift, but she doesn't even make the effort to say it. She uses the excuse that we can't celebrate birthdays and that it's haram for her to get me a gift for my bday.

This year, I didn't get her a gift, (even though she was dropping the ""you don't need to get me a gift"" hints, which very obviously and quite clearly when she said it meant that she wanted a gift) but I still said ""happy not birthday"" to her and she seemed pissed/visibly annoyed that I didn't get her a gift. 

Just another thing, she also has a knack for always taking my stuff, whether it's my stationary, my badges from my bags, accessories, food etc but majority of the time, even after telling her that she cannot keep it, she doesn't give it back. I don't want to take it from her because imo it seems a bit mean but atp it's a bit much.

I'm with 3 other girls, 14, 15, and 16. I'll just call them that. Now, the story for the choreography includes me being the main role. I was the first to volunteer for it, but another girl wanted the part. She didn't look at the group chat all weekend so not only did she miss her window, but there's no way she can learn the choreography in time. She was cross, but she accepted it. We asked her to wear yellow and black as that was what her character was supposed to wear and pink and black and red and black were taken days ago. My character is supposed to wear blue and white and I did, but when I got to school on performance day 15 was wearing blue and white which would really wash me out. She was wearing black tights so I offered her my black jacket and a yellow hat, but she refused. She said she wanted to be the main role. I told her no and that her role was the smallest so if we had to we could kick her out of our group. She told me that I was being unfair and has turned a few of my friends against me.

37,1fi9l28,AITA for refusing to give up my bedroom to visiting family members?,"
Im a 30 year-old, single woman. In a few weeks I'll be moving to a new city in a different state for work. I'll be moving into a small one-bedroom apartment.

A little over a week ago, my older brother, his wife, and I made a trip to an IKEA store to check out some sofas.

I was looking for a lightweight sofa for the new apartment, that could  be easily dismantled and moved around by myself.

I found a sofa that fit the bill. Both my brother and his wife also agreed it was a nice sofa and that I should get it online and have it delivered.

A couple days later, my brother and I were talking about my move. At one point, he says, ""you'd better buy a pull-out sofa for when we come to visit.""

I was surprised. I told him that I had already decided on the sofa that we  saw in the IKEA store, but that I'd make up the sofa nicely and also get a sleeper mat to put in living room for them.

My brother gets offended and says, ""No if, we are coming to visit, you should either have a pull-out sleeper sofa or give up the bedroom.""

I get upset and tell him that it's really unreasonable to put demands on me as to what furniture I should buy or where I should sleep in my own apartment.

Basically, we start to argue. He tells me it makes no sense to have a couple sleep in the living room in a one-bedroom apartment. He tells me I shouldn't be so attached to my bedroom. 

I tell him that I'm not the type of person to visit someone's house (either friend or family) and make demands about sleeping arrangements.

Then the argument starts to get heated. He tells me I'm being an ""absolutist."" He tells me I put too much emphasis on my own comfort. He tells me that I'm not being considerate of the fact that he's married. 

I tell him that I feel like I'm being penalized for being single. I already deal with family members who infantilize and condescend to me. They don't see me as an adult woman, deserving any respect. And so I'm always expected to compromise and be the ""peace-maker."" 

Ultimately, after nearly an hour of arguing, my brother and I apologized to one another. We are both really close and neither of us likes to fight.

Basically, my brother resolved that if he comes to visit by himself, he'll sleep on my sofa. But if he comes with his wife, they'll stay elsewhere.

I told him that I would look at some sleeper sofas, since I hadn't put in my IKEA order yet. And also said that I respect that he and his wife may not stay over with me when they come to visit. 

Truthfully, I still feel hurt.

Even though we put the argument to rest, I just want to know if I'm truly being a selfish and unreasonable asshole. Obviously, there's a logic to having a couple take the bedroom. But im also tired of always having to compromise. 




Edit: (Additional context)
I do not live with my brother. I live on my own. But we live very close to each other 15 mins away. We see each other all the time. Now, for the new job, I'll be moving 6 hours away. 

Also, I realize how ridiculous it is to have an argument based on hypotheticals and over a sofa, no less. All I can say is that we are Asian-American and we grew up with emotionally immature parents. We grew up walking on eggshells. I think we both developed this strategy of ""gaming out"" and talking through every possible scenario. 

There's definitely more emotional baggage behind this conversation. As the single, daughter I've become the default caregiver to our boomer parents (who did not prepare for retirement properly). Our parents often stay with me, sometimes for months at a time. They do not stay at my brothers place (they dont like his wife). This will likely change now that I'm moving.

 The two of us siblings try to help our parents as best we can (financially and emotionally). We've always been close, probably because we grew up dealing with our parents' nonsense from such an early age. As adults, my brother is much better at maintaining emotional boundaries with our parents. I have trouble with that. I have a lot of guilt over asserting my own independence.

Overall, though, he is really supportive of me. He's just obstinate from time to time and doesn't always see how difficult it is to be the daughter in our family and how often I make compromises for everyone else.

Anyhow, this out of state move will definitely be a new chapter for us all!

I get upset and tell him that it's really unreasonable to put demands on me as to what furniture I should buy or where I should sleep in my own apartment.

Basically, we start to argue. He tells me it makes no sense to have a couple sleep in the living room in a one-bedroom apartment. He tells me I shouldn't be so attached to my bedroom. 

I tell him that I'm not the type of person to visit someone's house (either friend or family) and make demands about sleeping arrangements.

Then the argument starts to get heated. He tells me I'm being an ""absolutist."" He tells me I put too much emphasis on my own comfort. He tells me that I'm not being considerate of the fact that he's married. 

I tell him that I feel like I'm being penalized for being single. I already deal with family members who infantilize and condescend to me. They don't see me as an adult woman, deserving any respect. And so I'm always expected to compromise and be the ""peace-maker."" 

Ultimately, after nearly an hour of arguing, my brother and I apologized to one another. We are both really close and neither of us likes to fight.

Basically, my brother resolved that if he comes to visit by himself, he'll sleep on my sofa. But if he comes with his wife, they'll stay elsewhere.

I told him that I would look at some sleeper sofas, since I hadn't put in my IKEA order yet. And also said that I respect that he and his wife may not stay over with me when they come to visit. 

Truthfully, I still feel hurt.

Even though we put the argument to rest, I just want to know if I'm truly being a selfish and unreasonable asshole. Obviously, there's a logic to having a couple take the bedroom. But im also tired of always having to compromise. 




Edit: (Additional context)
I do not live with my brother. I live on my own. But we live very close to each other 15 mins away. We see each other all the time. Now, for the new job, I'll be moving 6 hours away. 

Also, I realize how ridiculous it is to have an argument based on hypotheticals and over a sofa, no less. All I can say is that we are Asian-American and we grew up with emotionally immature parents. We grew up walking on eggshells. I think we both developed this strategy of ""gaming out"" and talking through every possible scenario. 

There's definitely more emotional baggage behind this conversation. As the single, daughter I've become the default caregiver to our boomer parents (who did not prepare for retirement properly). Our parents often stay with me, sometimes for months at a time. They do not stay at my brothers place (they dont like his wife). This will likely change now that I'm moving.

 The two of us siblings try to help our parents as best we can (financially and emotionally). We've always been close, probably because we grew up dealing with our parents' nonsense from such an early age. As adults, my brother is much better at maintaining emotional boundaries with our parents. I have trouble with that. I have a lot of guilt over asserting my own independence.

Overall, though, he is really supportive of me. He's just obstinate from time to time and doesn't always see how difficult it is to be the daughter in our family and how often I make compromises for everyone else.

Anyhow, this out of state move will definitely be a new chapter for us all!

38,1fi9dbd,AITA For refusing to wear headphones?,"So me, 30m and my partner 30f, live together in a decent sized two room apartment. But the walls are kind of thin and even if we are in seperate rooms you can hear each other as clear as if we would be next to each other.

Now, my partner talks with her bff several times a week and he also works as a psychologist so she uses him a bit for free advice, and he gets to complain about his miseries. Their thing seems a bit weird to me but it is fine and all, I'm glad they can talk like that with each other.  
Now my partner wants to have ""private"" conversations with her bff and started asking me to wear headphones when she is on the phone. So I don't ""listen in"". Which I don't, I have other a bunch of other stuff to focus on rather than their ranting to each other.

My problem is wearing headphones makes me panicky, unless I ""have to"", like when I stay up and watch something at night or so and cant disturb with sounds, or being at university studying with a lot of people around. But even at those times it is really hard to focus with them on, because I get claustrophobic. So if it isn't absolutely necessary I don't want to wear them.

My partner thinks I am an a-hole for this, but I don't think I am for not wanting to wear them for several hours, a few times a week, so she can ""talk without me listening in"". Which I don't do anyway.

This weekend, I was doing errands with one of the twins, ‚ÄúSammy.‚Äù In one of the big chain stores we stopped in, I noticed a Ouija board on the shelves and sort of laughed, because I didn‚Äôt think they sold those anymore. I pointed it out to Sammy, and mentioned how I used to play Ouija all the times on sleepovers and how fun and spooky it was, especially around Halloween. Sammy thought this sounded awesome (both girls like age appropriate creepy stuff) and asked if she could get it for her and her sister to play with. It wasn‚Äôt super expensive, so I agreed. 

Sammy was messing around with the box in the car on the way home, and was carrying it under her arm on the driveway. Our neighbor ‚ÄúMallory‚Äù (in her 60‚Äôs I believe) was on her porch and asked her what she had. Sammy showed her the box and I thought that was that, but Mallory gestured me over as Sammy headed inside. She asked why on earth I bought that for my girls and didn‚Äôt I know I was opening up my home to dangerous spirits through such a form of divination etc. This honestly floored me. I knew Mallory and her husband were religious, but they‚Äôve always been fairly chill and seeing that they gave my wife and I a really nice housewarming present, I assumed fairly modern as well.

I swore off dating to grieve and heal from his untimely death and ensure i was ready for any relationship without being hung up on grief. My friend was the one who broke the news to me. But nonetheless i met this man and I fell in love. Ultimately the downfall of our relationship was we moved in together too soon and as I had never lived on my own let alone with a man I realized I wasn‚Äôt ready and for the sake of our relationship moved back home. I was very judged when I made the decision to move in with him by this friend and I feel the need to note that she has been begging her bf (m24) of 3-4 years to move out with her as well. She was not happy for me and even laughed at the idea. I let it go and did it anyways. She proclaimed she knew what was going to happen and i should‚Äôve never done it.

I live in the capital of my country and I have my best friends there, as well as my older sister (21F) who's not coming with us because she has work and studies.

My mom's been planning this for 2 years, I was happy at first because I had family there, but recently I've been stressing a lot. Last year I didn't have any friends at school and my bsf wasn't in the same school as me, but I did see her outside of school, and even with that, I hated school and I wasn't happy.

My mother has people there, but I don't. I know what I'm going to say is childish but I think she was kind of selfish and I resent her for it. Couldn't she have waited t'ill I graduated to move in? She said she has nobody there but she has her children who she's going to leave here to take ""responsibility and grow up"" 

I didn't say anything, yes I showed my anger sometimes but I never acted out and said I didn't want to go or whatever. I just sucked it up.

She kept quiet until we pulled up to the house and as soon as she went up she started yelling, cursing and ranting to my sister about whatever.

My mom said I want to stay here just because of my sister and bsf and I was like yes I have my whole life here, and she said I just have one friend here and that she (my mother) was my whole life. She said I always put her last while she treats me right and she implied that I was ungrateful.

Hi Guys throwaway account so no one IRL finds this, AITA? needing a bit of advice.

I‚Äôm currently 13 Weeks pregnant and honestly not doing good at all, I‚Äôm currently taking cyclizine for horrible all day sickness that just isn‚Äôt letting up. I can‚Äôt eat I can‚Äôt drink and honestly it‚Äôs a challenge to leave bed most days.

I‚Äôm in hospital every two weeks for checks.

I‚Äôm not sure if I might have HG but it‚Äôs currently a topic I‚Äôm in discussion about with my doctor.

I have also just been diagnosed with PCOS and told I have to start blood thinning injections due to some other family history.

A friend I grew up with asked me about a year ago to be a bridesmaid at her wedding, of course I said yes but now that the wedding is fast approaching. I genuinely do not think i am in any fit state to be getting up at 5am to be at the venue for 6am, and then be a present bridesmaid all day.

I would also like to jump in and add here that this ‚Äúfriend‚Äù hasn‚Äôt checked on me once, I haven‚Äôt seen her since December last year and honestly she has not shown one bit of interest in my life or pregnancy no matter how hard I have tried to maintain a friendship with her.

I voiced my concerns to said friend who went on to guilt trip me, told me I was breaking her heart, that this is the worst thing anyone has ever done to her etc and she asked me why I couldn‚Äôt just put on a brave face for pictures and sit with a bucket ‚Äúit‚Äôs just morning sickness you gotta laugh‚Äù was her response.

This friend has never been pregnant.

I felt awful and hesitantly said okay, so paid the money to get my hair and make up done and arranged to try on my dress again.

My condition however has worsened since my last conversation with her which has led to me having to do the hard thing and text her again to say I can‚Äôt do it.

This is where it gets messy, she completely went off on me, guilt tripping me horrendously, making me feel like the worst person on the planet, as if I didn‚Äôt already feel awful about this whole situation. I didn‚Äôt choose to feel like this and she is just not understanding. Shes said some really mean things to me and I just don‚Äôt think she understands that I am genuinely really ill.

I would never even dream of making somebody feel like this.

So she wants me to total up the bill, so I start another column on her piece of paper, jotting down line totals, and get to some things noting $5.00 and qty 0.5.

I insisted that when we're doing math, it's important to be consistent, otherwise it gets confusing, and I'd need to ask her which of these things are things she wrote down the total for, and which ones are things that she wrote down the unit price for, since it wasn't clear.

At this point she tells me to stop being so legalistic with my math, and complains about other past times when I've followed the rules (eg, no outside food at the amusement park...which turned out to be a ""rule"" that is almost always ignored)

A few days later I was working with another manager, Ty, and asked them if they could take one of my closing shifts so I could help Pal. They agree.

Later, Ty tells me that I have to trade a shift with them bc they had been in a battle with L over working closing shifts. I was mad that Ty backpedaled after agreeing, that I was working 6 days without overtime, am frustrated with my job situation in general. It showed. The whole situation was stressing me out. I had to reach out to Jeb and Pal communicating updates, waiting to get the ok on a shift trade that would keep be below 40 hrs, and I was upset at myself for putting myself in a situation where I am working many days in a row with little time off. I cover shifts, trade shifts, come in early and stay late very often. So I was upset that my coworker Ty was not willing to do me a favor.

Ty notices I am upset and asks why. I say Im frustrated that they backpedaled, I have to communicate with several parties just to cover someone else. I assure them that I am mostly upset at Jeb for complicating things and that I will be fine. Everything is fine afterwards.

Fast forward 9 days. I am closing with Ty. In between the two shifts, Ty was written up by Jeb for being very aggressive about not closing.

A bit of background is that may be important. FIL is a very conservative Christian and her family lives in a small town about an hour away from where we live

We asked MIL a couple of weeks ago if she could stay over, and there was no issue. My wife went alone to pick up her sister, but first she wanted to do some other things in the town. On her way there, my wife gets a message from her mom asking if we asked her dad because he's upset we didn't ask him directly. My wife then calls me asking what to do and we come to the conclusion that we shouldn't pick up her sister. My logic was that clearly he was not ok with it otherwise he would raise no objections when his wife told him. It kinda felt like he wanted us to call him so either he could tell us no, or so he would feel in charge. We have played that dance before and didn't want to do it again. We felt bad because at the end of the day the person who was really hurt was the sister, but we wanted to stand our ground.

So we call MIL in the evening and she says she is coming into town the next day (Sunday) and might be able to get permission from her husband to take the sister, her husband was ""thinking about it"" (We still haven't called FIL and don't plan on it).  It was inconvenient for us since we cleared our Saturday for the sleep over assuming we could get chores done on Sunday. So at 10 in the morning (2 hours before they would arrive) MIL texted me that the sister was coming. It felt last minute to me and almost like we couldn't say no without being the bad guys. So anyway sister gets dropped off and we spend the day with her. I asked MIL about the problems yesterday and she basically said that her husband didn't us to watch any movies (he's talking about showing her kids movies like Disney or whatever) with the sister. So obviously I asked why he didn't text us or something  and I didn't get an answer. Then I asked how long in advance did she tell her husband that we were taking the sister and she said a few days in advance so I asked her why the problem only came as my wife was driving to pick up her sister. Again no real answer.

We felt bad because at the end of the day the person who was really hurt was the sister, but we wanted to stand our ground.

So we call MIL in the evening and she says she is coming into town the next day (Sunday) and might be able to get permission from her husband to take the sister, her husband was ""thinking about it"" (We still haven't called FIL and don't plan on it).  It was inconvenient for us since we cleared our Saturday for the sleep over assuming we could get chores done on Sunday. So at 10 in the morning (2 hours before they would arrive) MIL texted me that the sister was coming. It felt last minute to me and almost like we couldn't say no without being the bad guys. So anyway sister gets dropped off and we spend the day with her. I asked MIL about the problems yesterday and she basically said that her husband didn't us to watch any movies (he's talking about showing her kids movies like Disney or whatever) with the sister. So obviously I asked why he didn't text us or something  and I didn't get an answer. Then I asked how long in advance did she tell her husband that we were taking the sister and she said a few days in advance so I asked her why the problem only came as my wife was driving to pick up her sister. Again no real answer.

AITA? I feel like the path of least resistance would have been having my wife or me calling, but we didn't want to cave in to the weird demand. I do feel like I was petty by not calling but I wanted to stand my ground.",0.0,0.9662857055664062,1,0
53,1fi785n,AITA for running away from home after my parents treated me like this?,"So, one day in late June, I was really tired of my Gym class, so during lunch, me and some friends went off school property, and messed around (for example, we smashed a broken TV we found), and I had fun. But when I got home, I was in huge trouble, and my parents locked me in my room for a sentence of 2 weeks, and took almost everything out of my room. I powered through about a week and a half.

But then, after the exam that day, I went to the mall with one of the friends I skipped with (for later reference, I will call him Sodium). We had a lot of fun, but then my older brother who was there (and had asked to be there) caught us. Me and Sodium booked it, and when I got home, I was in even bigger trouble, and my parents said I would be in there until the beginning of August. Me, being the 15-year-old I am, I tried to act grateful for the punishment, to get a different, more fun punishment, which ended up with my parents taking everything else, including my bedding (sheets, blanket, and pillow).

So the next day (Thursday), right after the exam (which was coincidentally my Gym class), I explained to Sodium the situation, me and him decided to go to his house, and stay there.

54,1fi72l1,AITA for telling my husband people are laughing at him,"Using a throwaway account. I (40f) have been married to my husband (36m) for around 9 years and we have one dd(6) together. The three of us  were out for a walk in a local park when a young couple walked past us and the lady started smirking. It was here the issue started: I made a passing comment to my husband that she was probably laughing at him and he started behaving really strangely. First he said she was probably wondering why a handsome young man like him was out with an old woman like me, then went quiet and said he thought my comment was really cruel, asked me Who I was to look down on him, and said if he embarrassed me so much he could wait in the car. 

For the rest of the day and the next day he largely refused to engage me in conversation, giving terse ‚Äòyes‚Äô and ‚Äòno‚Äô answers to everything I asked him and refused to eat the dinner that I'd made.

That night he told me I had really hurt him and he didn't realise the amount of contempt I have for him. As he had been basically ignoring me all day I didn't say anything back.

Things came to a head this morning as I needed something to get our daughter ready for school that I thought he might have left in his car. I was still annoyed with him for his behavior so might have shouted at him for help instead of asking him. He then flipped out at me saying I had no right to treat him like that anymore and started insulting me in a way he never has before in 12 years of being together (calling me fat, insulting my career etc). He also said if I thought he was something to laugh at he wasn't sure he wanted to be married me. I said I keep telling him to change and maybe now I'd finally got through to him.

A little later after I had dropped Dd at school I called him while he was driving to work. He apologised for what he'd said to me, saying that he had spoken out of anger and didn't mean any of it but kept on saying how much I'd hurt him. I said again if he didn't want people to laugh at him he'd have to change. 

He said he didn't really know or care what strangers in the park thought of him but did care what I thought. He said wasn't sure he could stay married to someone who thinks he is so pathetic that strangers spontaneously laugh at him.

AITA or is he over reacting?

Info: There wasn't a specific reason why I thought she would be laughing at him but he doesn't take much care about his appearance.

We've been living together for 6 months and initially things were great. I always encouraged her to have friends over, we threw a few parties where our friend groups mixed. All was good.I struggle to define boundaries so it's possible I'm in the wrong here for not speaking up sooner. 

The problems started when she brought her friend and two random guys home one night 2 months ago. I woke up and asked her friend not to have sex on the couch. We all laughed and I went to bed. They hooked up. My roomate has insisted that they 'just' fooled around but tbh, whether or not there was actual penetration I don't care, I wasn't pleased. A week after this I noticed the couch was broken. I was pissed and told my roomate I felt like it was because of her friend and the guy. She was upset at the insinuation and said that she understood being annoyed, but my assumptions about her friends was unfair. I apologised and we left it there. 

1 month ago I stayed away for a night. The next day I noticed a sweater in my room. I handed it to my roomate and she said 'oh that's my friends, we got ready here'. I didn't say anything. 

Last week I wanted a Valium after a dental procedure. I checked my bathroom cabinet where I keep mine, and they were gone. I asked my roommate and she said she had no idea what happened. 

This weekend while I was away for the night, I saw on Instagram that her friend (who slept on the couch) posted a story with my roomate and some guy I've never met in my bedroom (using my mirror for the photo). That night around 6am, she brought that same friend with a guy back to the apartment.

I tried chatting with her yesterday but I didn't feel it went well. I didn't mention them being in my room as tbh we didn't even get there.I said I wasn't comfortable with her friends bringing guys back to hook up. She was clearly VERY uncomfortable and said things like 'I don't know why you're bringing this up when we've already discussed it/they didn't even have sex/there were sheets on the couch/I feel like you're suggesting I'm some gross person who let's people have orgies in the sitting room'. I reassured her that I was not judging, just expressing preference. Honestly I'm disheartened by the convo. I feel like she victimised herself using the power dynamic against me. 

I plan to reopen the discussion this evening after work as there are things that haven't been discussed. I.e, people entering my room.

I only learned about her going into labor when I got signal again. By the time I got to the hospital she has already given birth.

This was about a 1.5 years ago and I am involved father. The issue is every single time we have an argument she will bring up I missed the birth. It happens almost every single time form serious arguments to what fastfood should we get. Today was my breaking point, we got into an argument about her wanting to change the daycare situation. She wants to change daycare to one closer to the home. I do drop off and she does pick up. The only one closer to our home is too expensive and we can not afford it.

In the middle of the argument she pulled out I wasn‚Äôt there for the birth again.  I told her she needs to get over that and stop using it in every fucking argument we have. She called me a jerk and left.

60,1fi2uqs,AITA on my Dad's last day of Radiation Therapy?,"Yes, my Dad was diagnosed with Glioblastoma in July and has had 6 weeks of Radiation and Chemotherapy.

This is his last day and my Mom, my brother and I are here to support him.

The issue is the hospital has a thing where the patient rings a bell signifying the end of their initial treatment.

My other siblings want to capture it in film, which is fine with me.

But then they want to take a group selfie in front of the bell, that of which I have an issue.

My brother even accused me of being embarrassed to take a selfie, which I have never been a fan, but I feel it is not the time or place.

To me it feels insensitive or disrespectful toward the other patients and their supporters in the waiting room.

They might still have a ways to go in treatment or might be days away from being told their treatment might not be going so well.

To me, it is about being respectful and just leaving hoping you don't have to go through this again. But given my Dad's diagnosis, having had time to read up on it, it is surely bound to show up again.

You gotta take your victories, but I feel he is not out of the woods yet if he ever will be.

I hope I haven't rambled too much.

One of the girls has an en-suite, and I share a bathroom with the other (I‚Äôll call her Sophia). For the last two years we‚Äôve taken it in turns filling up the toilet roll cupboard in the bathroom, it holds about 15 rolls. 

Since January of this year I‚Äôve been dating my current boyfriend, and we‚Äôre now at a point where I spend 95% of my time in his flat. I tend to spend 5/6 days per week at his flat and 1/2 days max at mine.

This morning my flatmate stopped me in the corridor to ask me to go out and buy toilet paper. I said I was working but would pick some up tonight. She said it had been empty for a few days and it was my turn to restock. I apologised and said I‚Äôd pick some up.

63,1fi23cu,AITA for refusing to eat all of my wife's food?,"So I (37m) and my wife (35f) are cooling down from an argument right now based around me telling her point blank to make less food in the future or I'm going to continue not eating it.

The backstory is pretty simple and nothing to the point of threatening our marriage or anything. I'm getting up in years and as a basketball player and these knees are startng to go. I had eventually reached around 89kg (196lbs) at 176cm (5'9) tall around the tail end of Covid. I knew I had to make a change and at least get down to my pre-Covid weight (around 74kg, or 163lbs).

Now I'm actually all the way down to 70kg! I'm happy with my progress and I'm set on making this my new normal moving forward until old age and beyond.

But my wife isn't exactly thrilled I've shed all the weight. There aren't love handles for her to play with anymore. Most devastating for her is I don't eat nearly as much as I used to. We trade off cooking duties every day and when it's me, I usually make just enough.

But when she cooks? There is always enough food for another full plate of food. My wife is tiny so she can't eat it, and I'm now a dude who doesn't eat it, either. I always say we can save it and have it for dinner the next day again (I don't eat breakfast and lunches are provided by my work), and while that worked for awhile eventually the leftovers just went in the bin and she'd ask me to cook something new instead.

Although it's been fine more or less she doesn't hold back on commenting. To her, men should be eating seconds or thirds. It's just the Japanese way to her (she's Japanese and we live in the country), and she always recalled her father enthusiastically asking for seconds and thirds. She's feeling more and more ashamed that her husband doesn't like her cooking.

But I do! Her cooking is fantastic. And I eat as much as I can when she makes it! It's just she makes too much now. We've had talks about her portion sizing, but it's always gotten back around to letting her cook her way.

This all boiled over earlier tonight when she asked if I wanted a second serving of karaage (a delicious fried chicken) and I said, ""Nah, I'm way too full."" In which she countered with, ""Are you just going to throw away all this chicken then? That's so wasteful.""

I knew I was giving the wrong response immediately, as the words left my mouth, but still I said it. ""YOU are wasting all of this chicken. I told you to make less food. I've been telling you for months. I don't see you eating the chicken, either. You are the one wasting money and time making all this extra food that I won't eat, and that's not going to change.""

I'll try to keep it as short as I can. I promise I'll clarify things if there are confusions and sorry about them in advance!

I'm 21F and I have 2 siblings. My sister is 24 and engaged. My brother is 28 and married to my sister in law who is 25.

My parents hosted a family luncheon to celebrate my sister's engagement at their house. I went early to help them set up, my brother and sister in law a little bit later then everyone else. My sister and her fianc√© arrived last.

Everything was going well and everyone was happy until my sister got a text and pulled me aside. She asked me if I could go outside and meet a friend's of hers who's going to drop off something off for her. I did. The 'something' was a big ball of pure happiness, a Saint Bernard dog with a cute little formal tie around his neck.

As adorable as he was, I couldn't bring him in because my sister in law is allergic. Her allergy is not severe but still. Everyone in the family knows of it. I told the friend to please wait while I talk to my sister, she did not. I texted my sister that I can't bring him inside. She texted that it was fine, to bring it in because it's a surprise and he's the newest addition to the family. I insisted that I can't then I texted my brother about it because it had been 10 minutes, I'm standing in the driveway with a big doggie that would not stop licking my legs, not knowing what to do.

From what I was told, inside, my brother pulled my sister aside and asked her not to bring the dog in. That she knows his wife is allergic. She refused, saying that it's an open space, that sister in law will be fine. He then told her the news that sister in law is pregnant. (I already knew and they were waiting until she passed her first trimester.)

My sister then went outside, dragged the dog and then me in when I resisted. My brother, seeing this, excused himself and left with sister in law. 

We tried resuming the lunch after that but it was awkward at best. When my sister and her fianc√© cut the cake, she grabbed her glass of champagne to make a toast. The 'toast' was her rambling about how selfish my brother and his wife were, that they couldn't let her have one day to herself and had to ruin and overshadow it. That they were not the first or last couple to get pregnant. Both of my parents tried to shush her but she was on a roll and went on to call sister in law an attention seeker that just had to give the family the first grandchild.

I finally had enough and told her that green isn't a good look on her and that she was going to choke on her jealousy one day. Then I got up and left.

She called me a bitch on my way out. My mom called me after and told me that it was a bit harsh even if she was harsher.

69,1fi0trt,AITA for bringing my own roll of toilet paper to a friend‚Äôs house because I don‚Äôt like the kind they use?,"So, I (23F) have a bit of a thing about toilet paper.

But during the last sleepover, she caught me taking out my roll from my bag and asked me why I brought it. I explained that I have sensitive skin and sometimes I find certain types of toilet paper harsh, so I bring my own to avoid bothering anyone or making a fuss about it. But then she gets really offended saying I was being ridiculous and making her feel bad about her choice of toilet paper.

Now she's upset and says I'm being rude and over the top, but I honestly think I was just being practical, taking care of myself quietly.

See, I might be the asshole because I could‚Äôve just used her toilet paper for two days and one night and not made her feel bad about it. But her toilet paper is so rough it almost feels like a.... umm... sandpaper.

Every since I was about 4 or 5 it was obvious that I was a good person; I would always go out of my way to help my friends or family or even a stranger, because I was raised a good way. But because I'm a good person whether my family admits it or not they 100% take advantage of it when asking me to do things for them. Like if they asked me to give them money, ask me to buy something, go somewhere or do something; they always had this unlining meaning like it was ""do this for me or else"". Maybe I've just taken it the wrong way but that's truly how it feels. Now leading up to the point of the story, about 2 months ago my father had very serious back surgery, he basically had like 3 surgeries in one. The surgery took about 4 and a half hours but my father was fine after it, but because of the surgery I decided to me the main care giver for my father, because the only other people in the family are my older brother who made it very clear that he was barely gonna put 10% percent in which my parents said whatever too, my older sister who lives with her fiance and kids, my mom who has  a high demanding job at a hospital, and my little sister who is only 9 with is obviously a no so I decided to set up and be the main care giver.

Ever since the surgery my family has just expected me to just do whatever, mainly because they still treat me like I'm a 15yr kid even tho I'm a 19yr man. I will be honest at the moment I'm unemployed because I quit my last job, mainly because I had to cut my hours by like 90% to help with my father then some unrelated things happened and I quit, ever since then I've kinda ""worked"" by taking care of my father my parents cover my rent, food, phone bill, and wifi payment which I am very grateful for, so I guess I understand my parents asking for alot but at the same time I shouldn't be the only on in the house feeling like a butler in my own home.

78,1fhxwmh,WIBTA if I called my boss out for breaking a deal we had?,"So for background information I am a hunter. I live and breath anything hunting. Last year in September I met Tim (fake name) and made a deal for hunting, I would help him work his cattle ranch feeding and watering the cows, building fences, bailing hay and other various ranch activitie. All I asked for is return was permission to hunt his land. Note I told him no other payment was needed only the hunting rights. Fast forward to earlier yesterday while I was driving past his property I notice 15 elk out in the field, I drive to his house and ask if I can go hunt them and if he wants to join me. Tim says he has other work to do so he can't hunt them and he tells me I am not allowed to hunt them either. He said let's make a plan for another day this week when I was off work so we can both have a chance at an elk. We planned for Wednesday morning and hunting all day. Then later yesterday while I was at work he texts me saying he needs my help tracking an elk telling me he shot one right before dark. I told him I would help him track in the morning. The reason I am mad is the property the elk were on is only 40 acres, if left alone they will stay for a week or more. If they get bothered they leave the property for a long time.  So it's not like I can wait for them to come back. Also I feel like I have paid for the right to hunt not with money but through the work. I feel cheated out of a hunt and my time.

79,1fhxt3i,"AITA for kicking my sister out, so she has to live in a dormitory.","Hello!

I (19m) started University and have been living in an apartment I inherited from my real mother's mother. (My mother was never in my life, this was her way to ""make things right"".)  
I moved there in June and found a job that I could do part-time while going to school full-time.

We are from a small town with only an elementary school and the closest high school had a bad reputation and takes 45 minutes with the school bus.  
Luckily for my (step)sister (16f) who graduated from elementary school, was accepted to a nice high school in the city, as she had pretty good grades. Her options were to live in a dormitory or with me in my apartment, as it is walking distance from her school, and even tho this apartment is not very big, it has 2 bedrooms.

My stepmother (sister's real mother) and father agreed that that was the best idea, and I agreed because even without rent the bills from the apartment were high enough to be pretty good junk from my salary from the part-time job.

First things were nice, as we usually get along nicely with my sister, but in the first school week she found some new friends and it turned out to be annoying for me.  
She started to arrive home late and often smelled like alcohol and cigarettes, I told her that I couldn't fall asleep without knowing where she was.

The last drop was last Wednesday, I arrived from work at 10 in the evening and she was nowhere, I sent her messages asking where she was and no reply, she appeared home at 5 in the morning - and did not sleep a moment.  
I told our parents, that I couldn't live like that and my father told me ""Don't you remember when you were this age"" and ""You will also have kids one day"" - and I said that why not, but I didn't want to worry about kids today.  
  
I called the dormitory on Friday and asked if they had a vacancy and they did! I sent them all my sister's information and told them that our parents would sign everything on Monday.  
When she went to visit her parents on the weekend, I took all her stuff, loaned a car from my friend and took her stuff to our parent's place and told them, that I couldn't do it anymore and she could live in a dormitory, she has a place there. (Demand for High school student dormitories is not too high, lucky me.)

My father was pissed and told me that I am an asshole for making my sister live in the dormitory.  
Sister cried and said she did not want to share a room with some stranger.  
I know she also hates the fact, that the dormitory has strict rules including curfew.  
Only my stepmother shrugged and told me that it was my sister's own fault she did not listen to me.

I feel like my sister hoped that living with his older brother was her chance to have freedom, but I feel responsible for her.

I have the lower apartment which means I have neighbors living above me about two weeks ago. I got a letter in my mailbox from the neighbor above me complaining about a noise. She said it was loud thumping noise happening at night and said she thought I was exercising. I wish I was exercising, but in reality at that time, I‚Äôm probably on my couch watching West Wing. 
I responded to the letter painfully, politely apologizing several times, but explaining that I did not know what noise she would be referring to. I promised that I would try to stay quiet just incase. after this, I never got another complaint and assumed that everything was fine.

I was freaked out so I didn‚Äôt wanna open my door, but the banging didn‚Äôt stop so I eventually peaked out my window and saw a woman standing there. I cracked my door and asked if everything was OK and I realized it was that neighbor.. she said she was hearing the noise again and when I said I wasn‚Äôt doing anything she told me that she had filmed me making the noise and could see my shadows. at this point, I got freaked out and apologized again but I genuinely had no idea what noise she was talking about. She said it was a loud thumping so loud that it was shaking her apartment. Again, she lives above me so if there was any noise would I not hear it too. 
I eventually gave up and apologized again but shut my door. I could not get the whole ‚Äúfilming and recording me‚Äù thing out of my head so I called my mom.

86,1fhwid7,AITA for telling my roommate to stop using my expensive shampoo?,"I live with my roommate, Sarah (26F), and we have been sharing a two-bedroom apartment about a year. We get along pretty well, and we split all the bills, groceries, and chores, but recently I have this small issue that's bugging me, and I don't know if I'm overreacting or not.  
  
Context: My skin and hair get easily irritated, so I use this expensive shampoo and conditioner priced at $25 a bottle. I am perfectly willing to shell out extra for it because it does not cause me scalp breakouts, and my hair stays healthy; Sarah, on the other hand, uses run-of-the-mill stuff from the drugstore, which is perfectly fine for her.  
  
A couple of weeks ago, I discovered my shampoo and conditioner were going a lot faster than the last time. Maybe I was just using more; I don't know. But keeping track said Sarah was using my products.  
  
Once, I lightly said to her, ""I am surprised to notice that my shampoo has become so low, and I have spent so much on it."" I did not point at her for the issue, but I think that would give her a clue about my expectations.  
  
A few days later, I caught her red-handed in the shower using my shampoo. I really didn't want to make a huge issue out of something like that, so I waited till she was done with what she was doing and then brought it up gently. I said I had noticed that she had used my shampoo and asked her if she could please not anymore because it is expensive, and I really need it for my hair. I even suggested that she be given the chance to try it once or twice for her to get used to the feel, then she can buy her own.  
She looked kinda annoyed and said, ""It's just shampoo. I didn't think it was such a big deal. Besides, we share other stuff in the apartment.""  
  
I said to her: indeed, while not being petty about sharing other stuff, this shampoo is something I need for a given reason, not as we agreed to share it. She rolled her eyes and said, ""Okay, whatever,"" but from that day on, things have been kind of tense. I feel like she's giving me the cold shoulder, and now I am starting to wonder if maybe I overreacted in this.  
  
Not that I'm broke, but I didn't want to be in the habit of having to replace a $25 bottle every few weeks. And yet, I didn't want to let something as silly as shampoo destroy a beautiful friendship.

88,1fhwd36,WIBTA for trying to move out without saying anything ,"I, 18F, have a roommate 18F. We moved into college dorms last month, and I am having problems. She is dirty and hasn‚Äôt cleaned since we moved in a month ago. She leaves food everywhere, her hair is all over the ground, never does laundry, and she has trash under her bed. The trash is often overflowing. I don‚Äôt really care about her side it‚Äôs gross but not my business. 

I filled out our roommate contract and asked her to read it and either add to it or just sign it. In the contract, I stated that we would take turns cleaning the shared areas (bathroom and hallway/sink) and taking out the trash, emphasizing that we would not let it overflow. She started helping with the trash a bit but now isn‚Äôt doing it again. The floor is covered in her hair in every single corner, and I have to vacuum every day. She even left a glob of shampoo on the shower floor. Last week, she had to look through the trash after losing her dorm key (which she accused me of throwing out and she later found in her pocket) and left the trash she had gone through at the door. All she has to do is take it down the hall to the trash chute.

I‚Äôm not saying anything  because I don‚Äôt like telling people what to do, she may be depressed or something so I don‚Äôt want to make it worse if that‚Äôs what it is, and feel guilty since sometimes we get along. My friend and I have been brainstorming ways to approach the topic, but I‚Äôm worried that after last night, I may have made things worse. 

Last night, I was doing my hair with my lamp on and the lights off; it was around midnight. She went to sleep for a couple of hours, then woke up, which she often does. While she was sleeping, I had the lights off and my desk lamp on, but when she woke up and was talking on the phone, I turned the hallway light back on to see better. I finished at 5 a.m., and she never mentioned that the light was bothering her. I understand it was late, so I was mindful, but when I realized she wasn‚Äôt sleeping, I felt comfortable turning the light on. 
Today, I cleaned as usual while she did nothing. I decided to leave the shower and bathroom to see if she would do it and went to study. She did not clean but was talking on the phone, so I said nothing. That‚Äôs when she told me I kept her up all night with the light, and I had to apologize. She said she was on the phone because she couldn‚Äôt sleep but never told me the light was bothering her. I don‚Äôt understand why she didn‚Äôt say anything last night which is another reason I am uncomfortable as she is very stand off ish towards me and only talks when she feels like it.

Now if I say anything about her habits, I will come off as petty. I‚Äôm now considering switching roommates because I believe she should be more responsible, and I don‚Äôt want to teach her how to be an adult. I also know that I am getting to the point of anger and believe my words will come out harsh. 

Am I in the wrong for having the light on, and is it unreasonable to switch roommates without saying anything?

91,1fhvu0l,AITA for prioritising school over my sick mother?,"   To start this off, I have now moved back in with my parents due to personal reasons, but that doesn't affect the story, and I'm writing it now since everything is already over but I'm still overthinking this.

In September 2023 I have made the decision to go on a little vacation to my sister's apartment, to live with her for a week, try out streaming, and relax.  And around a week before that my mother revealed that she had cancer. It greatly affected my mental health, I felt helpless, I was worried for her and just simply scared. For added context, both my parents are alcoholics, and were abusive or absent most of my childhood, which also affected my decision making so I still decided to go through with the vacation for a new reason, to clear my mind. 

So a few days later I took my PC, a small luggage of clothes and some other necessities and stayed at my sisters' house. I enjoyed the calm atmosphere, noone yelling at me, being able to sleep in and sit at my computer for hours. Later I realised how convenient it would be for me to stay there for the whole year, living close to the school and taking some weight of off my mother's shoulders. I asked my sister if she would be fine with it and she said yes. So I called my parents to ask, and they also agreed. 

Generally, life was great there, I made new friends, I was able to play games I've never thought I could, I learned how to cook, and that I could be treated like a human, and respected. My school was also going okay, and now that I'm writing it, I already have my finals results and I passed with flying colours. 

But my mother was still sick. It turned out that she had way more going on with her health. The point is: somone close to all of us said ""she's an asshole for leaving her mother alone during such a hard time and that she should have been there to support her, and studying was a poor excuse for wanting to have a better internet connection"". And that sentence still lives in my head.

 I also started worrying that I was a burden to my sister because she had to take care of me. I knew that if I stayed with my mom that it would hurt me to see her everyday in pain, but that she needed support, and help with chores. Also after she (mom) heard that statement she said that she was fine with it and it was for the better, that I could focus on studying and she was happier knowing I was looked after.

To start this off, I have now moved back in with my parents due to personal reasons, but that doesn't affect the story, and I'm writing it now since everything is already over but I'm still overthinking this.

In September 2023 I have made the decision to go on a little vacation to my sister's apartment, to live with her for a week, try out streaming, and relax.  And around a week before that my mother revealed that she had cancer. It greatly affected my mental health, I felt helpless, I was worried for her and just simply scared. For added context, both my parents are alcoholics, and were abusive or absent most of my childhood, which also affected my decision making so I still decided to go through with the vacation for a new reason, to clear my mind. 

So a few days later I took my PC, a small luggage of clothes and some other necessities and stayed at my sisters' house. I enjoyed the calm atmosphere, noone yelling at me, being able to sleep in and sit at my computer for hours. Later I realised how convenient it would be for me to stay there for the whole year, living close to the school and taking some weight of off my mother's shoulders. I asked my sister if she would be fine with it and she said yes. So I called my parents to ask, and they also agreed.

92,1fhvlei,"WIBTA for refusing to go to a party my parents set up for a long lost relative that I have never met, the day after my wedding?","I am getting married at the end of the month and we have a lot of family coming in from out of town from both sides of my family and my partner‚Äôs family. My parents (dad and stepmom) decided that they would plan a ‚Äúfamily reunion‚Äù the day after our wedding to take advantage of the fact that everyone will be in town. The way that they presented it to me was that this is really for everyone to get to meet my kids and my sister‚Äôs kid, whom they haven‚Äôt met yet, even though they will be seeing them at the actual wedding the day before. 

They are expecting us to be at the party by NOON the next day, and wouldn‚Äôt take no for an answer. I told them that it is a lot to ask for us to be anywhere the day after the wedding, let alone assuming we would just be up and ready to go so early the next morning. They left it at us just trying to make an effort to show up at some point, to which I said, ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù. 

There‚Äôs one HUGE detail that they left out when they told me about the party. It turns out that my parents decided that this ‚Äúfamily reunion‚Äù is actually about my aunt meeting her long lost adopted daughter whom she just got in contact with a couple months ago. So, it‚Äôs not at all about family meeting my kids, but for everyone to meet this new family member who will be coming into town the day before my wedding and staying with my parents. Mind you, my parents still have not mentioned this detail to me, but told my sister, which is how I found out about the true reason for the party. 

My partner and I are furious that they would even consider planning such a thing the day after our wedding - the reason why people are in town in the first place. Not to mention the fact that we have so many other family members who are also coming from out of town that we would like to see as well. It would be one thing if my parents threw a little post-wedding family get together celebrating our marriage, but they decided to go with taking all of the attention off the wedding and putting all their energy into this get together for someone I have never met and most likely will never have a relationship with. So, WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt go to this ‚Äúfamily reunion‚Äù, even though many family members flew in from as far as California to the Midwest? 

EDIT: I feel that I should emphasize that while I still think that this is an inappropriate time to plan this ‚Äúfamily reunion‚Äù, what is more frustrating is the implication and expectation that my wife and I be there so early the day after our wedding while still under this false pretense for why they are having the party. 

What is also incredibly frustrating, and I feel is really inappropriate, is the fact that this person is coming from out of town and staying with my parents, who seem to want to put all their attention on them being there and making more of a big deal about them being here than the wedding. This could have been planned any other weekend and it‚Äôs added stress onto top of an already stressful and exhausting planning process. 

Some of you have also stated that, ‚Äúit‚Äôs not about you anymore after your wedding, so YTA for complaining.‚Äù You guys seriously wouldn‚Äôt want to be celebrated for the whole reason why family is coming to town in the first place?

That's where the problems begin. When I told Lottie, she was immediately uncomfortable with the idea because she doesn't know Sarah. I thought it was okay because Sarah was my friend, and I wanted them all to be friends. When I asked Lottie if it would be different if they had met, she told me they did when Sarah went to the bakery to buy a muffin or something and said she was sweet and that she was okay with Sarah going. 

Later, she sent me a long paragraph over text about how she was uncomfortable with Sarah going, how stressed she was about the whole thing, and how she thought everyone was going to be weird because they also don't know Sarah. I apologized for not asking beforehand and said how I thought it would be okay and didn't even think about asking. Then she sent a couple voice messages about how stressed she was and said Sarah shouldn't come.

97,1fhu2x0,AITA for ditching a wedding that I (f20) was the maid of honor in because the bride (f22) tried to set me up with the best man (m28)? ,"


I was supposed to be the maid of honor at a wedding a few weeks ago.  I ended up just leaving and going home to my boyfriend of 6 years after the bride and groom tried to set me up with the best man.  

When my friend got engaged last year I was excited for her and even more excited when she asked me to be the maid of honor.  As invites went out though she asked me to not bring my boyfriend to the wedding.  I was really upset about that but my boyfriend talked me down telling me that weddings were expensive and they were probably trying to keep the guest list down and they didn't really know him so it would be fine for me to go without him.  That made sense to me so I didn't say or do anything after that and just continued with helping as I could as the maid of honor.   

Nothing else really concerning happened again until a couple of days before the wedding.  The bride asked me to give the best man a ride to and from the wedding which was about a 4 hours drive.  I thought it was just part of it as he was a veteran and had his own issues surrounding that.  So i gave him a ride up to the air bnb that we were staying at before the wedding.  The whole time he tried to make conversation that was just weird to me and I was just not into it and just trying to my best to be nice to him.

At the air bnb with everyone I immediately noticed things were off.  All of the other bridesmaids had their boyfriends there and things were really awkward when I found out I was in a room with the best man.

The next day before the rehearsal dinner the bride and groom cornered me in a room to say that the best man was an incredible guy and that I was blowing him off without really giving him a chance.  I told him well of course not I have a serious long term boyfriend which yall specifically told me not to bring.  Then the bride cut in and told me we'll that really isn't that serious since he hasn't proposed in so long. I argued back that was because we were both still in school.  We continued arguing for a little while before  I finally just said forget I'm going home.  I got called all sorts of awful names going out of the room and packed up and left.

I got a lot of calls on the way home which I ignored until my boyfriend called.  Apparently the bride called him and told him I just left for no reason and he called to check in on me.  I told him everything that had happened and he was kind of dumbstruck by it all.

Anyways after the wedding I've had the bride, the groom and a lot of their friends call or message me telling how horrible of a person I was for just leaving the night before the wedding for no reason.  None of which were receptive to my side of things and it's starting to worry me that maybe I overreacted by just leaving like that.  Anyway AITA 

Tl;dr left a wedding because the couple to be were mad I wasn't giving ing the best man a chance even though I've been with someone else since I was 14.

Edit: I started dating my bf in high-school, he's 2 years older than me  my friends don't really know my bf since he doesn't go to the same school as us and when we do see each other it's usually half way between our schools.",0.0,0.0158416517078876,0,1
98,1fhsyoz,AITA for telling a girl I‚Äôm not asking my dad to buy her a plane ticket after she called me DUMB?,"Okay, so for some context, I (18F) am from Costa Rica and here public universities are a big deal. They‚Äôre seen as way more prestigious than private ones, and some public university students have this whole superiority complex. I go to a small but pretty good private university, where I study Economics and Business Admin.

Back in February, I went to a party hosted by a friend. She goes to a public university, and there I met this girl named Mari who was studying at the same college as my friend. At first, she seemed super nice and was actually pretty interesting to talk to until she asked me where I study, and I answered honestly and her mood flipped completely. She went from being all friendly to condescending, I asked her if something was wrong, and she snapped at me, saying she doesn‚Äôt bust her ass for a scholarship at a public university just for some ‚Äúdumb, privileged girl‚Äù to come and brag, which I wasn‚Äôt doing at all, I was literally just answering her question! I ended up leaving with a few friends because it was awkward after that.

Flash forward to now, my birthday is coming up, and I decided that the party will be at my parents‚Äô apartment in Punta Pac√≠fica, Panama. It‚Äôs one of those ‚Äúbring your friends‚Äù kind of parties, and I‚Äôm really excited about it. I didn‚Äôt choose Panama just because my parents own a place there, but also because it‚Äôs close to Costa Rica, and tickets aren‚Äôt that expensive. Plus, the skyline and big city vibes are so much better. But I do realize not all my friends can afford to fly, so I told my dad and he offered to pay for two of my close friends, including the one that is classmates with Mari. 

Well, she found out about the party and reached out to me, saying she wanted to come. I wasn‚Äôt going to be rude, so I said sure. But then she told me she didn‚Äôt have money for the plane ticket and asked if my dad could pay for her too like he did with my other friend. I literally laughed because I thought she was joking she was dead serious. I told her there‚Äôs no way I was going to ask my dad to do that, and she flipped out again, saying I don‚Äôt care about other people. She even said I should move the party to Costa Rica. 

I snapped and told her that it‚Äôs my birthday, and I get to decide where I want to celebrate it. I said if she can find a way to get to Panama, she was more than welcome to come, but if she doesn‚Äôt, she shouldn‚Äôt expect the dad of the girl she insulted to pay for it. Now she‚Äôs mad, calling me selfish and saying I‚Äôm proving her point. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair for someone who was rude to me to try to dictate my birthday plans. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm throwing my party in NYC or Madrid or something, its in the country next door, where we don‚Äôt even need a visa. And I‚Äôm already helping two of my close friends. 

I told my dad about all this but he said I was out of line for how I talked to her. He thinks I came off as tone-deaf, even though Mari was being completely unreasonable.

 So this happened over the weekend. Me (17M), my mom (47F), Joseph (my older brother, 21M), and my nieces were eating supper. I was sitting one one side of the table at the far end with my mom on the other side and Anna (7f) in between us to my right.

She moved the dining table out of the dining hall and put it in the kitchen and now sleeps in the dining hall as the house is packed since we moved and she already had quite a bit of things here. Like I said, sometimes she will go into my grandfather's room to sleep. (there are two different beds in there, so they can sleep separately, and they do).

But just a while ago, she came into my room. This room is the only one with AC, so she said she came to cool off. Fine. I was okay with it & I was peaceful. Then she started nagging me about things, so I got annoyed. Have I done this yet, have I done that yet, why is this like that etc. Someone calls her, and I'm watching something on my laptop. She asks me to turn it down. So I told her she can leave if she doesn't want to hear it. I asked her to leave. Then she gets mad. Like, I was in here minding my own business and then you came in here to cool down. If someone calls you, you can easily get up and go outside. But instead, she's telling me to turn down what I'm watching.

When I get even more pissed, she tells the person on the phone (my aunty) that I was telling her to leave my room (i've been told that i shouldn't have the audacity to even call it my room). Then I get told that I'm only a squatter here; basically saying I have no right to tell her to leave her own room, even though it was my grandpa that was staying in here before I came.

Then when I put on my headphones since they were making such a big deal about turning my volume down, she starts asking me to do something for her on her phone. I notice her trying to call me, but I pretend I can't hear her through my headphones until I can't any longer. When I begrudgingly help her because I was annoyed, she then threatens to call my mother to my aunty and tell her that I'm watching something (a movie) on my laptop and not doing school work, even though she knows I was in here last night doing my school work with my friend (online).

Every time she comes in here and I ask her to leave because I want my privacy, I'm made to feel guilty because i've been told ""she gave up her privacy for you"", and I get that. But she can stay in the separate bed in the room next door with grandpa. And she has. They don't fight every second of the day, so it's never been a problem. I appreciate her giving this room to me and I've never denied that. But just because she chose to give up her privacy doesn't mean I should be forced to do the same.

104,1fhrzne,AITA for not cooking all my parents meals while they were visiting me?,"For context, I live with my fiance in a different country than my family. I haven't seen them in over a year because, so my parents (61F and 63M) offered to visit me, and I was beyond happy. They have very humble beginnings in a third world country and this was their first time making an international trip, so I tried to make sure everything was perfect and as smooth as possible.

They came and spent about a month in our house. They had their own bed, their own bathroom, I arranged for all their necessities, and, even tho we're not rich, my fiance and I tried to provide them with everything so they wouldn't have to spend their money here, where the currency is 5x their own.

About our eating habits, my fiance and I have different schedules, different diets etc so we don't eat together. Whenever one of us is hungry, we go to the kitchen and make ourselves a plate of food (we work from home). I explained this to my parents, and I also said, the kitchen is yours grab whatever you want and cook whenever you want.

As time went own, we noticed my parents weren't eating much, so I asked them what they wanted from the grocery store so I could buy it for them. They said everything was fine, that they were indeed eating while I was working. My mom is naturally peckish so I thought that was just how she ate (I haven't lived with my parents in over 10 years so I wouldn't know for sure). In any case, my fiance brought my dad to the grocery store with him and told my dad ""grab whatever you want"". And he only grabbed a few items. Anyway, this went on for pretty much the whole month. And everytime I asked they said it was all fine. At some point, I started taking them out for dinner every day after work, which quite literally broke the bank but at least I could see them eating. They left a few days ago, saying they loved their stay and that they had a blast.

So to my surprise, my sister (40F) called me today ripping me a new asshole, saying that my parents told her that they had no food to eat. That there was food in the fridge that they couldn't eat because it belonged to us and that they had to keep making trips to the convenience store to buy food for themselves and that they spent a lot of money. I couldn't believe my ears.

I'm feeling totally blindsided by this. I thought they knew how to cook their own food and if there was something missing, that they would've told me to buy. I took their word for it when they said everything was fine and that they were eating. My sister says I should've been more attentive to their needs and that I acted like I didn't give a fuck. So now I'm feeling bad, thinking my parents were miserable and starving the whole time, while I thought they were fine. I don't want to bring this up to my fiance, he will be devasted. He was genuinely trying the best he could to make my parents happy. Am I the asshole? What more could I have done? My head is spinning right now so sorry for the long text

**UPDATE**: thank you so much for all the replies, I appreciate all insights. It was kinda funny to see how invested some of you got over my family drama lol so that made me feel less down.

Anyway, so I got a hold of my mom, who is the most level headed family member and asked her what they said so my sister had such a strong reaction. Some of you were correct, my sister did blow this out of proportion. But ALSO, my parents, particularly my dad, have a strong feeling of inadequacy, which I knew of but I never thought I would become the focus of it. Essentially, she said my dad felt like he didn't deserve any of the things we were doing for them, hence why he chose junk food over the quality food we provided. My dad has some self hatred that was present my whole life, he is very overweight, he smokes and he's also a functional alcoholic. Me and my partner are fitness oriented people, so we paid for a monthly gym subscription for both of them so we could all go together. They both said they wanted it but my dad went a few times only. I did notice he was smoking a lot more than I remember and he was also buying beers every week.But I guess it was his way of coping with whatever feelings that were triggered by his first international trip. Apparently, he never thought he would go anywhere.

My sister heard all of this and thought that I did something that made my dad feel this way. That I mistreated him or that I somehow caused this idk. None of this is true. I was super happy to have my parents here and I'm not ashamed of them whatsoever, I was proud to introduce my family to my American friends and everyone went above and beyond to make them feel welcomed. I did everything I could possibly thing of. I'm not rich, but I'm prudent with my money so I do have a comfortable life. This doesn't mean I can stop working tomorrow, I'm not a millionaire. But the issue is not with me, is with how my parents feel inside. It's almost like I'm being punished for leaving poverty behind and somehow, they chose to distance themselves, like I'm an outsider.

So it wasn't about the food, it was about my dad and his extreme inferiority complex, that stopped him from enjoying his time and connecting with me, my partner, in my house and my new reality. My mom did apologize on behalf of my sister, said she planned on talking to me and regretted that she didn't, because of how my sister brought this issue to me.

105,1fhru05,AITA for flipping the bird to a tesla parked in my neighborhood? ,"My friend Don (m43), my mom (f63), and I (m29) were taking a walk together after a small party one afternoon (sept. 8th, a sunday).  We all had been drinking and were feeling a bit tipsy.

At the end of the walk, we came upon my neighbor's tesla- the neighbor in question is across the street and to the left of my house, ive never met them but ive seen kids playing with the dog in the yard. We were feeling jazzed, so we started horsing around about the car.

I definitely don't care for teslas and my buddy Don agrees that Elon Musk is a chode- so we started making goofs. I shot the bird at the car and made some other obscene gestures and my friend made snide comments as my mom softly chastised us for being rude- but no one was around so it was okay‚Ä¶ right?

I didnt think anything about it and went on about my business for the next week or so.

Yesterday- September 14, a Saturday- my mom calls me, and tells me that this lady came banging on our front door. She was complaining about me having made obscene gestures and they had caught it on camera.. either the tesla had cameras or their house, im not sure.. but she was pisssed according to my mom.

She accused us of being racist and exposing her kid (m8) to discrimination (as he had watched the camera footage) . I had never met this woman before and had no idea she was POC. I literally just hate elon musk and like to talk smack about his dogshit cars. She threatened to take us to court if she ever caught us on camera like that again.

My mom explained to her i was just bitching about the tesla's CEO, and according to my mom, the lady seemed to calm down a bit after that. The lady admitted to having asked other neighbors about who we were to pinpoint our house and my mom is worried she talked shit about us to our friends and neighbors. The lady was still pretty mad as she walked off, and I have no idea what to do about this.

 So Reddit, am I the asshole? And should i go apologize In person, even if i dont feel a bit sorry about hating tesla?


Edit:

Glad so many people responded to this - to the folks saying i was angry, i wasnt, i was just having some fun at the expense of Elon. It spawned some fun conversation and, unfortunately, some bad taste hand waving üíÄ. It was childish but seriously,  who stops to think that far ahead when they've been drinking ?

108,1fhrj1t,AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don't know if I can afford a good Christmas present for him,"My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been together for 5 months, but have been friends since 7th grade. Me and my boyfriend have both been working since we were sophomores, and as of senior year he worked a good paying job (around $800-1k a week) and I worked a $9/hr + tips job. 

Recently I quit my job due to college and the long commute, but my boyfriend is still working. Since the beginning of senior year my boyfriend has paid for my food, and we went on an expensive summer trip for my birthday fully paid by him. Whenever I could I would pay for some of his things, but my paychecks would frequently be less than $300 biweekly so it would be difficult sometimes.

A couple days ago he asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I asked what my budget was to come up with an appropriate gift. He said I had around a $200-$300 budget and I told him what I wanted. He then asked what his budget was and I said ""Maybe around $50 seeing as though I don't have a job"". He got a little disappointed and asked if the budget could be $100, but I explained that I am trying to prioritize school currently, and I don't see myself getting a job until next semester when I get a car. I then stated that I wouldn't just get him a $50 gift, I would get him a handmade sentimental gift like a couple's scrapbook.

After I mentioned the sentimental gift he said ""why would i want that?"" and I was a little disappointed. I wish I could afford a good enough gift for him, but that's difficult with a job. He's been bringing up how much money he's spent on me lately and it makes me feel bad because I never asked him to do so. Even with a $50 I would have to save money from now until Christmas, and I don't even know if he would fully enjoy the gift. So AITA for telling my boyfriend I don't think I can afford a good enough gift for him. ",Asshole,2024-09-16,"AITA for telling my boyfriend that I don't know if I can afford a good Christmas present for him My boyfriend (18M) and I (18F) have been together for 5 months, but have been friends since 7th grade. Me and my boyfriend have both been working since we were sophomores, and as of senior year he worked a good paying job (around $800-1k a week) and I worked a $9/hr + tips job. 

Recently I quit my job due to college and the long commute, but my boyfriend is still working. Since the beginning of senior year my boyfriend has paid for my food, and we went on an expensive summer trip for my birthday fully paid by him. Whenever I could I would pay for some of his things, but my paychecks would frequently be less than $300 biweekly so it would be difficult sometimes.

109,1fik6hd,AITA for not lending my Mom some of my scholarship money?,"I (18m) started college about a month ago.

My Mom (40f) is a very extroverted and loud person, the complete opposite of me. I don't do well around others, even family, but working has helped to alleviate much of that problem. She was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder after having my brother. When she's not on her meds, she can become very unstable and abrasive, and it creates a problematic environment. She's started calling out of her job and working Uber/Lyft instead, saying it gives her much more freedom with her schedule, but the gas prices have been destroying her lately. My brother and I always give her money in sizes of $5 up to $250 to help her. I love my Mother more than anyone in this world. She's the reason I am where I am today. Sometimes, she says or does things she doesn't mean, and I know she's trying to be a good person and Mother.

My graduation party financially ruined my Mom. She was set back on many bills and payments, and she's been playing catch-up since. She ended up pawning the PS5 I bought my brother as a gift, among other things. I'm still very bothered about it because I knew all her financial trouble could've been avoided if she had been wiser about how much money she would spend on the party. I knew something like this would happen, and I warned her beforehand. I gave her $900 of the $2.4k I had been given at the graduation party. She promised to pay me back slowly every month, but she's made promises like this before and not followed through. I didn't mind not being paid back because she drives me everywhere, so I considered it as 1 big gas payment.

I told my Mom that my Scholarship refund came in at about $6.6k, meaning I'm getting paid that amount every semester. I gave her the $900 about a month ago, but I am still paying her gas money for rides. A few days later, My Mom asked me if I could lend her $150 to help with rent. I hesitated before saying no for the first time, and she got furious. She told me that she thought I didn't trust her and that I wouldn't care if we were evicted. This hurt me a lot because, but deep down, she was right; a part of me didn't trust her. But she's my Mom, and I want to help her, but I also want to start planning for my future. This afternoon, after classes, my Mom was supposed to pick me up and take me to work. She called me saying she would be late because she was working to earn the money I didn't give her, saying, ""You wouldn't be in this situation if you'd just lent me the money."" I ultimately had to call out of work and waited an extra 2 hours for her to pick me up.

This scholarship money is a godsend, and I need to begin saving money for my future during and after college. My Mom is struggling, but I want to make this scholarship money last. AITA?

It was in another state and we booked the flights. Brian has an old friend who has a place near the location of the tournament and they offered to let me stay there to not worry about booking accommodation. It was a nice gesture of them and I gladly accepted the offer.

Fast forward to three days before the tournament, Brian backed out on me and said he won't be my partner for doubles. He said that he wanted to pair up with his old friend (person offering accommodation) instead.  I was shocked he did that since all this time I thought we were set on playing together and he abandoned me a few days before the tournament. I had to find a new partner immediately to replace him or switch events to play singles instead of doubles. There was no way to persuade him and I let it go. I couldn't find a new partner in time and decided to just play singles.

On the same day, my gf decided that she wants to come along for support. I asked Brian to ask his friend if he can accommodate one more person at his place. The house has 2 extra empty rooms where Brian could stay in one and for me and my gf to stay in the other. However, Brian's friend refused and said he can let me stay but not my gf. I understand his house=his rules and I'm not entitled to his home so I decided to find accommodation somewhere else although it was difficult finding a place so last minute.

I thought Brian is the a\*\*hole for switching up on me last minute, but being refused accommodation only added insult to injury. I know being refused accommodation isn't Brian's fault and it's Brian's friend's decision but it just felt like everything was starting to go against me all of a sudden. 

Shortly after we landed after our flights (flight was together with Brian, my gf and me), Brian's friend had something urgent to attend to so he told Brian to kill a few hours until he gets home. My gf and I went ahead to our hotel, dropped off our stuff, and decided to explore the area. Brian asked me if he could tag along.

Well, last night I ended up back in the ER with pain that is even worse than what I was experiencing when I went in February.

They did labs and a CT scan, determined there was no blockage or tear in my belly, and sent me home with antibiotics in addition to the steroids and immunosuppressants that I am already on. 
Usually I cook dinner every night, 100 percent prep the meal, cook it, and set the table with everyone‚Äôs drinks and plates ready.

115,1fiiqvl,AITA for ignoring my friend after she kept distracting me in class?,"I(16f) have pretty severe ADHD. I struggle a lot with taking notes and paying attention in class on a good day, and I do especially worse when there‚Äôs a specific distraction, be that audible or physical.

This year my school moved me down from all honors classes to being in the ‚Äòlower‚Äô classes, and it‚Äôs been a big adjustment. Most of the kids talk the entire time and it‚Äôs 10x more difficult for me to focus, but the school says I can‚Äôt get accommodations in the higher classes, so the ‚Äòlowest‚Äô ones are what I‚Äôm stuck with.

My friend Jordan and I have never been in classes together before this year, but now we share almost all of them. Jordan also has ADHD, but unlike me she doesn‚Äôt need to pay attention in class to do well and is really good at memorizing and taking notes. She always finishes taking her notes quickly, and once she‚Äôs done she usually gets bored and starts trying to talk to me.

At first I tried to subtly avoid this by sitting right front and center, because I know she hates sitting in the front of the class. However, today she didn‚Äôt seem to care about that anymore so just sat next to me anyway. Thus commenced many classes of me being unable to focus because she kept whispering to me, poking me, pulling on my clothes, and getting visibly annoyed when I tried to send notes telling her we can talk later and that I‚Äôm trying to pay attention.

She never seemed to get the hint, and instead just kept trying to come up with increasingly annoying and creative ways to get my attention. I thought maybe she was just having a hard day, and I let her ramble for the entirety of lunch, hoping afterwards she‚Äôd feel no need to talk more. It only got worse the next period though, and so during the break between classes I directly told her to cut it out and that I didn‚Äôt find it funny or appreciate it. She told me I was being dramatic, and that I never pay attention well anyways, so it doesn‚Äôt matter.

This made me really mad, so I just stopped speaking to her all-together and refused to even look in her direction until school ended. She was pissed, said I‚Äôm being an asshole for no reason, but I only said I‚Äôm not sorry and haven‚Äôt spoken to her since.

Our other friend Emma texted me a couple of minutes ago and said that Jordan had explained the whole situation to her, and while she understands why I‚Äôm upset, I should be more patient with Jordan and ignoring her was the wrong thing to do. I honestly don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm wrong, and it‚Äôs not like I plan to keep this up forever, but I think I‚Äôm justified for refusing to talk to her right now. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-16,"AITA for ignoring my friend after she kept distracting me in class? I(16f) have pretty severe ADHD. I struggle a lot with taking notes and paying attention in class on a good day, and I do especially worse when there‚Äôs a specific distraction, be that audible or physical.

This year my school moved me down from all honors classes to being in the ‚Äòlower‚Äô classes, and it‚Äôs been a big adjustment. Most of the kids talk the entire time and it‚Äôs 10x more difficult for me to focus, but the school says I can‚Äôt get accommodations in the higher classes, so the ‚Äòlowest‚Äô ones are what I‚Äôm stuck with.

My friend Jordan and I have never been in classes together before this year, but now we share almost all of them. Jordan also has ADHD, but unlike me she doesn‚Äôt need to pay attention in class to do well and is really good at memorizing and taking notes. She always finishes taking her notes quickly, and once she‚Äôs done she usually gets bored and starts trying to talk to me.

At first I tried to subtly avoid this by sitting right front and center, because I know she hates sitting in the front of the class. However, today she didn‚Äôt seem to care about that anymore so just sat next to me anyway. Thus commenced many classes of me being unable to focus because she kept whispering to me, poking me, pulling on my clothes, and getting visibly annoyed when I tried to send notes telling her we can talk later and that I‚Äôm trying to pay attention.

She never seemed to get the hint, and instead just kept trying to come up with increasingly annoying and creative ways to get my attention.

116,1fiiont,AITAH for ‚Äúcheesing‚Äù in a video game competition?,"
Hey guys! So me (20m) and my friends (all around the same age as me) are having a video game tournament.The game is NCAA Football  25. There‚Äôs money on the line so it‚Äôs pretty competitive, but everything has went over smoothly so far,no fights or anything like that. Yesterday I played my first game of the tournament against one of my friends (I‚Äôll call him Ron) and I ran 5 main plays (all runs), and only threw when I really had to. I ended up blowing him out. Ron complained about me running the same plays and that I  was ‚Äúcheesing‚Äù, but cheesing means that your running plays that exploits the AI or causes unfair glitches in your favor, neither of which I was doing.   I understand that Ron was upset that I kept running the same plays over and over again  but at the same time  he could‚Äôve adjusted his defense to try and stop me. So AITAH?

117,1fiie1i,AITA Opting out of Christmas ? ,"So for context, my boyfriend and I have an 8 year old daughter together, and his family is HUGE into Christmas. Most of his family though lives in another state and the last 3 Christmas‚Äôs we have traveled to Texas to celebrate with them. Other than our daughter there is only one other teenage boy in the family. The rest are adults. They have always done big Christmas, with a ton of gifts for everyone and I‚Äôd say I spend like 2-4k total for all 10/11 people each year which is a financial burden I‚Äôve never liked but have chalked up to it just being the way it is. They have always been kind to me, but it‚Äôs also very clear that I‚Äôm and outsider as I‚Äôm the only one not related or married into the family. They aren‚Äôt rude but I never feel super comfortable there and often get anxiety but I try to make the most for our daughter and again they aren‚Äôt unkind so it‚Äôs whatever - I want to add that I didn‚Äôt celebrate Christmas growing up and I don‚Äôt care much about it generally but I like the our daughter gets to do it with her family and enjoy the holidays.

This year though things are different : my boyfriends sister had a baby this year and his ex step brother ( who was estranged for the last 6/7 years) is now back in the picture with 2 kids now. ( ages 2/4) these kids live near us but I‚Äôve never meet them neither has my boyfriend but his mom is regularly involved and is planning to bring them to Christmas. So now it went from 2 kids to shop for to 5 kids ( 2 in which I‚Äôve never meet, not related to at all, whom is only a ex step brother of my boyfriends, and they aren‚Äôt even close and live with their mother full time). 

Everyone has decided this year to not buy gifts for the adults and only buy presents for the children. With a limit for each child. We also now have to take 2 cars on the trip there and back and I‚Äôm going to be stuck driving one of them when typically me, my boyfriend and his mom take turns( 15 hour drive). I feel as though this is all too much for a holiday that I don‚Äôt even like to celebrate or hold meaning to and I don‚Äôt like that I have to buy twice as much gifts now to adjust for for 2 children I don‚Äôt know at all and a baby. Not to mention the added stress of now 5 kids in one home, with 9 adults. It all seems to much and I honestly want to tell them all that I‚Äôm opting out on Christmas this year ( out of 8 Christmas‚Äôs, I‚Äôve only done the last 3, so I haven‚Äôt always gone but the first 3 years  my boyfriend and I were separated)but I‚Äôm worried that it will make everyone dislike me or that I‚Äôm being selfish and in the wrong here.

118,1fii3hq,AITA for keeping the income of my late wife's trust instead of splitting between our kids?,"I (63 M) lost my first wife, Annie, to cancer 28 years ago, when our daughters (Kendra and June) were 9 and 7.  

We had done pretty well for ourselves, so when Annie was terminal, we put all her assets into a trust that I manage. With my guidance, it has done even better. It generates about $45k in income every year now.

I got remarried when Kendra and June were 13 and 11. Since June finished undergrad, my wife, Miranda, and I have kept the $45k income from the trust. I have built up quite a legacy for when I pass - my wife and my daughters will be splitting the profits of 5 houses, Annie's trust, the trust I made at the same time, and my investments. Kendra and June will be pretty well comfortable.

June was dog-sitting for us in July, because she's a teacher and we need to schedule our vacations around her. She called me up demanding I explain why she and Kendra haven't been given the income from the trust. She claims she was looking for Annie's old writing, which does sound like something she would do. I don't think she was snooping to snoop - she's always been a sweet kid. 

I told her that the trust was to be split between her and Kendra when I die, but I want her to keep giving Miranda the $45k a year. She asked what my wife had to do with that money. I told her it was my prerogative how my money gets distributed. June argued that it wasn't MY money, but ANNIE'S money, and her stepmother has nothing to do with it. 

She complained that Miranda has a job in luxury sales and I have my pension and investments, but both she and Kendra are on food stamps. I admit that they are - Kendra, because she's bad with money, June, because she has medical problems. 

I told June that she would be set for life when I pass away, but she said I am acting like a greedy asshole. She says she and her sister should split the income from their mother's trust now. I told her that it wouldn't be anywhere near as much to split if I hadn't managed it so well. She started sobbing about how that $22k a year would change her life and let her get medical care, while I am just sitting on it.

I can admit that June has never been selfish or money-motivated. She works hard and does a lot for the family - or she used to. But I really do not understand why she feels so entitled to get this money that wouldn't even be here without me while I am still here. Annie's will and trust leave me in charge of everything until I pass. I used it to pay for both Kendra and June's college, so they only had to use their part-time jobs to buy books and school supplies.
