0,1fi5t3t,AITA for painting my son‚Äôs nails?,"I coparent my 5 year old son with his father. His father grew up in a conservative religious household but not longer practices as an adult. 

Yesterday, I was painting my nails as I normally do while our son was watching the movie Cars, a new recent love of his. He was curious and asked what I was doing and explained I was putting red nail polish on my nails. He asked if he could have some too, and I didn‚Äôt think twice. I just swiped the red nail color on. He was instantly overjoyed to have red on him like Lightning McQueen. He was so, so happy and excited and wanted to show his daddy and his friends at school tomorrow. I texted a picture to his dad and asked if he could wear the nail polish to school for one day to show his friends. His dad responded ‚ÄúNo, take this off immediately. We need to show him that some things are for boys and some things are just for girls.‚Äù

I told him I didn‚Äôt agree that this was a big deal but would take off the nail polish, and that if he had strong feelings about this, we should talk in person and not over text. I worked in a school setting for four years and saw many male teachers and students with nail polish, and I let his dad know that nail polish is pretty normalized between all genders nowadays. He accused me of ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù our son and asked if I was going to refer to our son as nonbinary? I let him know I felt this was being blown out of proportion.

Am I the a**hole? He and I are meeting this week. We have had a contentious coparenting relationship in the past and are struggling to regain trust. I regret ever doing this because it feels like we‚Äôre going backwards again now. But at the same time, I didn‚Äôt see an issue, it doesn‚Äôt hurt our son or anybody else, and want to stand my ground with not having him feel like he can dictate rules in my house (which he has tried to do before).

1,1fi3g8t,UPDATE: AITA for answering my daughter's question honestly?,"Link to the first post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f44qd9/aita\_for\_answering\_my\_daughers\_question\_honestly](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1f44qd9/aita_for_answering_my_daughers_question_honestly)

I am providing an update, because I think that the people here were right and my wording wasn't the best. So I decided to apologize to my daughter, tell her that I regret saying what I said to her, and that I should have spoken to her in different words, explained the situation to her differently. And that I'm sorry that my words upset her and I should . She told me that she isn't mad or angry at us, that it's not our fault for feeling the way we do. She told us that it is what it is and she's just going to have to live with being what she is. I told her that that's a very mature view, and that I'm proud of her. No matter what might have happened in the past, she is here with us now and we love her and I'm glad she can understand that.

As a reward for being so mature, I ordered her some sushi, her favorite food :) She's still a bit quiet, but I think with some more weeks she's going to get over it and be just fine. I'm thankful for the people here, even if some people were a bit harsh, that they made me realize how unfortunate my wording had been. So thanks for the deserved judgement!",UPDATE,2024-09-16,"UPDATE: AITA for answering my daughter's question honestly?
