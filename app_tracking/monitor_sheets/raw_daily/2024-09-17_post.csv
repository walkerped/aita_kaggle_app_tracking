0,1fj0wr0,AITA for doing nothing WIBTA if I told the truth,"My ex and i split in winter of 2023 
The whole year was rocky for us we were ment to get married. There was infidelity on my part and we called off the wedding 2 months before. they have since come out as trans. 
It was tough and things are still rocky from time to time but we are good friend and still spend most of out time together, we co parent (3 kids, youngest is theirs) together extremely well. we do lots of family activities on the weekends and regularly hangout together. They have even been staying with us (myself and the kids) while their kitchen is being repaired. 

The problem comes with the Family. 

my ex's family has completely cut me out
I haven't spoken to or seen any of them since March. I have been as polite and amicable as I can. The kids have still been invited to family suppers and birthday celebrations whereas I have been told i am no longer welcome. I have never stopped the children from going I have explained it away to them "" I'm not going to go I'm going to stay and have my own time"", or ""I've got a lot of cleaning to do"" 
I send gifts from the children, some of my ex's siblings would send postcards to the kids and I would make sure the kids sent them back. I let the kids go out with the aunts and uncles when they plan things for them. 
In March we had pre-arranged for my ex's family to watch our youngest While we went to a concert that had been a Christmas gift for my ex from myself. We had checked in with them a few times leading up to the date, we had booked a hotel room and then the day before the concert my ex got a message that their parents were on their way out of the city for the weekend and said they forgot, so i posted to Facebook about the situation and my hurt and upset and asked friends for help, that was the last I was allowed around them. 

Recently it was my ex's father's birthday and they were not going to make it home in time to attend but their parents still wanted the kids to attend and I was asked by my ex to drop the kids off. When I arrived no one Spoke to me no one came to the door to greet anybody or to get the carseat from me. I sent the kids in with gifts and just left. 

My ex's sister is getting married and I know that they are particular about what is worn to family events but no one has communicated anything to me about what the kids should wear and I am not invited to the wedding. In the back of my mind I know I should shop for them and make sure they are prepared but I also think that if they want nothing to do with me why should I be responsible for it if I'm not invited and no one is speaking with me.

1,1fix2yf,WIBTA for not wearing a wig,"A little context, my 22m boyfriend and I (22f) were invited to his brother's wedding. I recently got a buzzcut and have been in the process of growing out my hair. While this isn't necessarily relevant to the story, I identify as nonbinary and am already uncomfortable with wearing dresses and have decided to do that for the wedding at the very least. My boyfriend and I have only been dating for about 6 months and I haven't met much of his family yet, including the brother and his fiance. We plan to meet them before the wedding so they can get to know me a little bit before that.

Another side note, I've never been to a wedding before and am rather nervous already. I want to be as comfortable as I can to help reduce my nerves. While I do wear wigs every once in a while, I've recently found I've been more comfortable embracing my short hair. Another piece of information that may be important is that his family is pretty conservative/right wing. When I brought up my concerns over my hair with my boyfriend, he said he was concerned that it could possibly take attention away from the bride and groom on their special day. I said that I think it would be unfair to myself and others to be dishonest about how I look. He said although he has no problems with my hair, his family may have an issue with it although he disagrees with their views on it.

I really would like to go to this wedding as I feel it's an honor to be invited, but I'm a little conflicted. I don't want to cause issues at the wedding or make a bad impression, but I also don't want to feel uncomfortable or like I'm hiding myself from people who could potentially become my family. Another option I've considered if my hair becomes long enough is getting box braids (I'm bi-racial). So what do you think reddit? Am I being an asshole by refusing to wear a wig or should I put up with it just for one day to make a good impression? Another note, regardless of what the comments say, I will NOT be breaking up with my boyfriend over something so minor. I know you guys like to go a little too crazy sometimes.

2,1fivc8d,AITA for stitching up my boyfriend's toy with the wrong thread?,"The title sounds stupid because it is. Yes, my and my boyfriend James, 24M, are both grown ass adults and he has a stuffed toy turtle. He's weirdly attached to the stupid thing, he keeps it in his closet, and occasionally takes it out to look at it for a bit before putting it back. Its slightly larger than the size of my hand, grey and pretty unremarkable. 

Recently I've gotten a bit suspicious of the thing, which sounds stupid, but it does look like its meant to hide something, and whenever he picks it up, he squeezes it a little as if to check the inside. About a week ago, I couldn't take the curiosity anymore, and took the thing out myself. There were stitches on the underside, and i took a little nail clipper, and opened it. I just wanted to see what was inside. It ended up just being a pen.

I stitched it back closed of course, and he didn't notice. This morning, he took it out again, and this time he noticed. Apparently I 'used the wrong shade of grey'. James was furious, and called me quite a few names, including  that I was the worst person to have ever existed ever and that he despised me. I reminded him that when I'd asked if I could touch it, he said i could do whatever as long as I 'put it back right'. He said that 'obviously' didn't extend to cutting it open and i was a psycho. 

He hasn't been speaking to me since, and is keeping the turtle with him, even though he's pretty embarrassed of it.
