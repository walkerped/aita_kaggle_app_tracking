0,1fj0wr0,AITA for doing nothing WIBTA if I told the truth,"My ex and i split in winter of 2023 
The whole year was rocky for us we were ment to get married. There was infidelity on my part and we called off the wedding 2 months before. they have since come out as trans. 
It was tough and things are still rocky from time to time but we are good friend and still spend most of out time together, we co parent (3 kids, youngest is theirs) together extremely well. we do lots of family activities on the weekends and regularly hangout together. They have even been staying with us (myself and the kids) while their kitchen is being repaired. 

The problem comes with the Family. 

my ex's family has completely cut me out
I haven't spoken to or seen any of them since March. I have been as polite and amicable as I can. The kids have still been invited to family suppers and birthday celebrations whereas I have been told i am no longer welcome. I have never stopped the children from going I have explained it away to them "" I'm not going to go I'm going to stay and have my own time"", or ""I've got a lot of cleaning to do"" 
I send gifts from the children, some of my ex's siblings would send postcards to the kids and I would make sure the kids sent them back. I let the kids go out with the aunts and uncles when they plan things for them. 
In March we had pre-arranged for my ex's family to watch our youngest While we went to a concert that had been a Christmas gift for my ex from myself. We had checked in with them a few times leading up to the date, we had booked a hotel room and then the day before the concert my ex got a message that their parents were on their way out of the city for the weekend and said they forgot, so i posted to Facebook about the situation and my hurt and upset and asked friends for help, that was the last I was allowed around them. 

Recently it was my ex's father's birthday and they were not going to make it home in time to attend but their parents still wanted the kids to attend and I was asked by my ex to drop the kids off. When I arrived no one Spoke to me no one came to the door to greet anybody or to get the carseat from me. I sent the kids in with gifts and just left. 

My ex's sister is getting married and I know that they are particular about what is worn to family events but no one has communicated anything to me about what the kids should wear and I am not invited to the wedding. In the back of my mind I know I should shop for them and make sure they are prepared but I also think that if they want nothing to do with me why should I be responsible for it if I'm not invited and no one is speaking with me.

1,1fix2yf,WIBTA for not wearing a wig,"A little context, my 22m boyfriend and I (22f) were invited to his brother's wedding. I recently got a buzzcut and have been in the process of growing out my hair. While this isn't necessarily relevant to the story, I identify as nonbinary and am already uncomfortable with wearing dresses and have decided to do that for the wedding at the very least. My boyfriend and I have only been dating for about 6 months and I haven't met much of his family yet, including the brother and his fiance. We plan to meet them before the wedding so they can get to know me a little bit before that.

Another side note, I've never been to a wedding before and am rather nervous already. I want to be as comfortable as I can to help reduce my nerves. While I do wear wigs every once in a while, I've recently found I've been more comfortable embracing my short hair. Another piece of information that may be important is that his family is pretty conservative/right wing. When I brought up my concerns over my hair with my boyfriend, he said he was concerned that it could possibly take attention away from the bride and groom on their special day. I said that I think it would be unfair to myself and others to be dishonest about how I look. He said although he has no problems with my hair, his family may have an issue with it although he disagrees with their views on it.

I really would like to go to this wedding as I feel it's an honor to be invited, but I'm a little conflicted. I don't want to cause issues at the wedding or make a bad impression, but I also don't want to feel uncomfortable or like I'm hiding myself from people who could potentially become my family. Another option I've considered if my hair becomes long enough is getting box braids (I'm bi-racial). So what do you think reddit? Am I being an asshole by refusing to wear a wig or should I put up with it just for one day to make a good impression? Another note, regardless of what the comments say, I will NOT be breaking up with my boyfriend over something so minor. I know you guys like to go a little too crazy sometimes.

2,1fivc8d,AITA for stitching up my boyfriend's toy with the wrong thread?,"The title sounds stupid because it is. Yes, my and my boyfriend James, 24M, are both grown ass adults and he has a stuffed toy turtle. He's weirdly attached to the stupid thing, he keeps it in his closet, and occasionally takes it out to look at it for a bit before putting it back. Its slightly larger than the size of my hand, grey and pretty unremarkable. 

Recently I've gotten a bit suspicious of the thing, which sounds stupid, but it does look like its meant to hide something, and whenever he picks it up, he squeezes it a little as if to check the inside. About a week ago, I couldn't take the curiosity anymore, and took the thing out myself. There were stitches on the underside, and i took a little nail clipper, and opened it. I just wanted to see what was inside. It ended up just being a pen.

I stitched it back closed of course, and he didn't notice. This morning, he took it out again, and this time he noticed. Apparently I 'used the wrong shade of grey'. James was furious, and called me quite a few names, including  that I was the worst person to have ever existed ever and that he despised me. I reminded him that when I'd asked if I could touch it, he said i could do whatever as long as I 'put it back right'. He said that 'obviously' didn't extend to cutting it open and i was a psycho. 

He hasn't been speaking to me since, and is keeping the turtle with him, even though he's pretty embarrassed of it.

3,1fjbc16,UPDATE: AITA for punishing my foster daughter for telling the authorities my 12 year old daughter was taking drugs,"After receiving thousands upon thousands of comments, I would like to say that I realized my mistake. I wasn’t taking into account the immense amount of trauma that Mary has gone through at such a young age, and the effect it had on her actions.

I had a tough, but necessary conversation with both Lyla and Mary. We had a heart-to-heart, so that both girls could hear from each other's perspectives. What had happened was, Mary found out that Lyla had been hanging out with a boy that Lyla knew was Mary’s crush. This was also the one year anniversary of Mary’s parents’ overdose, and she confessed that her grief coupled with what she interpreted as Lyla's betrayal influenced what happened the following week. Mary maintains that she’d mistaken the candy for drugs, but she owned up to the fact that she’d notified the teachers, not only because she was concerned for Lyla’s safety, but because she believed that it wasn’t fair for Lyla to “get away” unpunished for having drugs, after everything that had happened to Mary’s parents.

I know I should have been angry at Mary. But seeing the response to my initial post has opened my eyes. I’ve been informed that traumatized children can lose their common sense after being exposed to triggers (I assume this applies even more when it occurs around the anniversary of their trauma) and this can lead them to make decisions that may sound outlandish in any other circumstances, decisions such as mistaking candy for drugs.

Mary has had bad experiences in foster homes before. Several years before her parents’ overdose, she was placed in foster care for the first time, before being reunited with her parents. She was in three different foster families and, in all of them, her foster parents favored their biological children, and they punished Mary if she told them about their bio children misbehaving. She was terrified that I would do the same, which is why she didn’t come to me first.

Mary acted out of pain, and I acted out of frustration without even hearing her side of the story. I lifted Mary’s punishment. At that point, we still had nearly three weeks of summer break left. Lyla has forgiven Mary, and we decided to put this incident behind us. Being a foster parent can be challenging, but I will be doing everything I can to learn from this situation and be a better mother moving forward.",UPDATE,2024-09-17,"UPDATE: AITA for punishing my foster daughter for telling the authorities my 12 year old daughter was taking drugs After receiving thousands upon thousands of comments, I would like to say that I realized my mistake.

4,1fjaimo,AITA for not visiting my friend Z when I was at a park close to him?,"So for context. I (m24) was at this park called Avalon Park, which is a nature preserve park. The other day, It got destroyed due to a recent flood that we had so I went to go check out the damage with a friend named C. This other friend of mine I’ll call Z (m27) of mine for 8 years lives close by, but I didn’t intend, nor did I even think about going to his place. Also him and I were not on the best terms recently but we still texted each other regularly and played iMessage games together. The day after I went to go to the park, I texted Z the next day saying “wow Avalon really got pulverized!” He saw on Instagram. He responds with “should have said hello. I guess I’m not the one avoiding anybody.” (Something I said weeks/months ago due to our constant random beefs). He also called me a pussy and shortly after I called him a bitch. The last year or 2 he would find a way to start an argument with me whenever and claim he didn’t start it. Whether it would be shit from the past that still bothers him, which he tells me not to mention cuz “it’s in the past”, ironically. ( he’s a massive hypocrite who’s quick to shift the blame). I feel like He definitely feeds off of negativity and won’t admit it. He got angry with me cuz I didn’t show up out of nowhere? He seems really jealous that I didn’t go to him and was hanging out with someone else. He asked “why were you at my neck of the woods?” And I said “ I can go wherever the fuck I want and you don’t own this park.”
Also, I’m not avoiding him. But I don’t have a car and the last time we saw each other was 9 months ago. Also, he is decent when we are in person. Every quarrel was through text whether it would be misinterpretation or some random thought that just angered the other person. He tells me to let go of stuff from yesterday, but he holds grudges. I mocked him and said poor z stuck on stupid bullshit from a while back. “I kept saying he was jealous and he tried to deflect by saying what do I have to be jealous of.” Then later on it leads to a bunch of hostile phone calls of us calling each other pussy, bitch, coward etc. I will say I am a very tit for tat type of person so you insult me (unplayfully) I insult u back.

Although I was into plenty of cringey things when I was a child and even had an undertale phase where I shipped myself with sans the skeleton, the stuff he watches is just complete brain rot content farms that make him fantasize about hurting others and being an ass to everyone due to the content. 
He has especially taken a fascination towards 'smiling critters' from a horror game that have been dumbed down for the sake of being entertaining for kids like my brother. It got to the point one of the characters catnap was all he talked about and I grew sick of him trying to get his friends to be as chronically online as he is and exposing them to that material. Call me cruel for this but when he was being especially mean and called me a fat cow for having the audacity to want him to eat his lunch I showed him a clip from the horror game, nothing graphic obviously, just a jumpscare clip from a Markiplier video with no blood or anything that I think would traumatize him. However he started crying and now refuses to go to the bathroom alone if the light is off or sleep alone in his bed despite me telling him it wasn't real, and when that didn't work I told him that our pets eat monsters so we don't have to be scared of them .... 

I do feel bad but I think he's overexadurating because all he's used to is overstimulating brain rot videos ... so am I the asshole?

7,1fj9hif,AITA for yelling at my family because they won’t stop nagging me? ,"
I (14F) recently had a huge outburst at my family, and now they’re all upset with me. Here’s what happened

For the past few months, I’ve been feeling really overwhelmed. School has been super stressful with all the assignments, tests, and trying to keep up with everything. On top of that, my family is always on my back about something. My mom is constantly telling me to clean my room, do chores, or study more, while my dad is always asking me if I’ve done ""enough"" for school or practiced whatever sport he thinks I should be doing.

Every time I come home from school, hoping to relax, I get bombarded with questions or lectures about what I should be doing. I try to explain that school is already a lot, but they don’t really seem to get it. They just say stuff like, “You don’t know what real stress is,” or, “You’ll thank us for this later.”

The other day, I came home completely drained after a bad day at school, and the second I walked in, my mom started nagging me about the dishes I hadn’t done. I lost it and started yelling at her, saying I’m tired of never getting a break and that I can’t even relax at home without being told to do something. My dad got involved, saying I was being disrespectful, which made me even more upset. I told them that being at home is just as stressful as school, and I feel like I can’t breathe sometimes.

Now they’re mad at me for ""talking back"" and ""having an attitude."" I feel bad for yelling, but I also feel like they don’t understand how much pressure I’m deal with.

The other day, I came home completely drained after a bad day at school, and the second I walked in, my mom started nagging me about the dishes I hadn’t done. I lost it and started yelling at her, saying I’m tired of never getting a break and that I can’t even relax at home without being told to do something. My dad got involved, saying I was being disrespectful, which made me even more upset. I told them that being at home is just as stressful as school, and I feel like I can’t breathe sometimes.

Now they’re mad at me for ""talking back"" and ""having an attitude."" I feel bad for yelling, but I also feel like they don’t understand how much pressure I’m deal with.

8,1fj96rf,AITA for bailing out on a food order ,"Me (21M) and my 2 other roomates were  ordering food. It was my idea and they agreed to order with me. I'm currently a college student and we have to pay up before we can actually place the order. I was the making the payment and ended up sending the money to the wrong vendor. It wasn't a lot of money but it meant i would have to talk to the vendor and ask for my money back or buy stuff worth that much. 

I was already having a sucky day, my exam didn't go so well and later on had to hear some stuff from my parents because they thought I don't study enough. Anyways after this I really just wanted to go to sleep so I told them they could order without me. But since I backed out they weren't meeting the minimum order value for a delivery. So I told them that they could order a can of coke or maybe like a chocolate as that would be enough for a delivery. They said i was being selfish and a bunch of random stuff i really wasn't in the mood for so I just stopped with the conversation there. They knew I was being moody and yet they kept pestering me about this for a while. I got really pissed and told them to shut up and go do their own thing.

A little backstory to why I was so frustrated was because in the past few days I have had 2 other similar issues with food related payments. I have yet to recieve the refunds for them both, And both of them know about this because I told them this was the reason I didn't won't to order after what had happened.

Now they are upset with me because they did not get to eat (We had already eaten dinner and this was noodles we were going to order after mid night) and I'm mad at them for not shutting the hell up, so I haven't really been talking to them .

9,1fj8whu,AITA for ignoring my friends messages on my me day? ,"

Nat, my friend [23] had bought us plane tickets to another country for next year, and this was without our concent. She has been wanting to do this for months, and we both kept telling her that we are uncomfortable with her paying for the entire thing (she does not work and her dad works at papa johns). She appears as if she don't have the money, and me and my other friend definitely don't. Well, Nat bought the plane tickets and the motel room in the country anyway. I won't get into too much detail about this, since it's not the topic. 

Anyway, we discussed last week that we needed to get the passport and so we originally planned to get them the upcoming Thursday. It was also discussed that my other friend and Nat would get out Tuesday to get the momey orders for Thursday. After we made that all these plans Nat decided to buy us movie tickets for that Thursday night. Then later, Nat brings up that she has an important exam on Thursday and that she'll be late getting out of school, and thus, wouldn't have time to get the passport. We all agreed that we will still make it for Thursday for myself and my other friend, while Nat will get hers on a different day. So great, I can still have Tuesday for myself. I needed this day for my own mental health so I was happy to stay home while Nat and my other friend got the money orders. (I also work 12 hour shifts so I really wanted this day). Well this morning, Nat starts texting me multiple times asking if I could come with them today to get the money orders and then we can get the passports, that way we all three can do it at the same time. She tried to convince me to come by saying things like it wouldn't take long and you can ""go home"" immediately after (which wasn't going to happen cause she doesn't hold onto her word). Now I know that a normal and mature response would be to tell her no, and communicate. However this isn't the first time that this has happened. She always asks me to hang out with her on my me days, and then proceeds to get upset when I tell her no. So I did not want to deal with that and chose to ignore those messages. 

I told my sisters about this and they started telling me that I should have went today since Nat was buying us those tickets and taking us to a different country. They then told me that I am a bad friend for choosing not to do this for Nat, and that it was the least I could do. But I've had a bad time mentally for the past few weeks and desperately needed some time to myself. And I couldn't take that me day on Thursday since my friend had bought those movie tickets for us all. So I felt obligated to hang out with them Thursday regardless. I also couldn't have another me day afterwards since after that I would be working all other days and have some stuff with my sisters I need to do. Tuesday was my only shot.

12,1fj6rtx,AITA for being out with friends later than I told my partner?,"I (23F) was with my former partner (24F) for about a year. While we were together (we broke up a while ago for reasons unrelated to this post), we had a recurring argument about me being out later than I said I’d be when I was with my friends and family. I don’t think I was in the wrong about this, but I’m not totally sure and want to figure it out before I date again. 

While we were together, I’d often go to a friend’s house or my sister’s house to watch a movie/get food/just hang out, and before I left, my partner would ask me when I’d be done. I’d give her an estimate, but would sometimes be out later than I said I’d be. I didn’t think this was an issue because we didn’t live together, didn’t have plans together later in the night, and I wasn’t out drinking or partying, just hanging out with my loved ones. She was upset when I was late, saying that if I told her a time, I had to be done at that time. 

For example, one time I said I’d probably head home around 9, and when I headed out at 9:30 and looked at my phone to text her, she had texted me at 9:10 that she was upset I was later than I said I’d be. To me, that felt a little controlling because I was just watching a movie with my friend and it was a bit later than I thought, but to her, I had lied about when I said I’d be home. 

Sometimes I was more significantly late than I said I’d be, usually because we started a movie later or food took longer, and I’d send her a quick text that I’d be later. In those instances, she’d get mad that I wasn’t true to my original word about when I’d be home. 

I think if we lived together, had plans together after, or I was out at a club, then I’d understand her side of this more. However, those things weren’t the case and I was just hanging out with friends/family, so I think I should have had the autonomy to be with my friends without worrying about the time so much. It had got to the point that I’d get stressed about staying on time while with friends so that she wouldn’t get mad, and it made hanging out with them less fun. But on the flip side, I do see how it’s important to keep your word and I didn’t want to come across as lying to her.

It was so much fun, but I couldn't help but notice that my co-worker (27f) that I invited was wearing a floor length white dress at the wedding. 

I didn't say anything, but I was very taken aback. Especially since I had vocally told her the dress code after she asked me and it was on our wedding website. My maid of honor also commented on this to me, but I just let it go because I didn't want it to put a damper on my big day.

Now a couple days have passed and we've been going through our gifts and all the cards we received, compiling a list so I can get the thank you notes all in order. I noticed that she also didn't give us anything. Now I fully understand not everyone is in the best place to give a gift, but I still think giving at least a card saying, congratulations that cost maybe a dollar would be an appropriate thing to do. It has nothing to do with being materialistic but just the principle of the matter. 

I'm a little baffled and put off by the whole thing.  Especially since I would consider her a friend at work and we have known each other for over a year and a half. It is why I wanted her to be there on our special day.

Would I be an asshole if I confronted her about this or should I just let it go? I don't want to come off as crass.

Edit: Thank you for all the insight on how my response to this situation would influence the outcome. It has been very enlightening. I'm definitely going to distance myself from her and keep our relationship strictly professional from now on.

So, I (29F) have been best friend with who i'll call ""Jake"" (26M) since we were kids. A few months ago, Jake fell on hard times and ended up getting kicked out of his previous home. I felt horrible for him and offered him a place to stay at my two-bedroom apartment while he got back on his feet. I thought I was being a good friend.

At first, things were going okay; he seemed grateful and tried to help out wherever he could. But as a few weeks went buy, things changed. He stopped looking for a job, started spending his days playing video games with his friends and didn't help with chores. I understand that he was going through a lot, but I still work a full-time job, and have side gigs as well, and come home exhausted. The last thing I want to do when coming home is to clean up after someone else.

To make matters worse, I started noticing that money would go missing from my wallet, as well as a hidden stash I had put away, that is now down to nothing. I set up a camera and eventually caught him taking cash from my wallet. When I confronted him, he brushed it off, saying he ""needed it for food and to cover one of his bills."" He rarely buys groceries, and I have been covering bills for both of us, but I am starting to feel the strain on my finances. I am at risk of losing the apartment, my car, and am barely able to afford groceries now because I cannot keep up with all of the extra expenses on my own.

Recently I overheard him talking to a mutual friend about me. He was saying I was selfish for expecting him to pull his weight, and that I was a bad friend for not being more supportive. Hearing this shattered me, especially when trying to help him has put me in the position I am in.

I have thought about asking him to leave, but he has nowhere to go, and I don't want to be a bad friend.

Recently I overheard him talking to a mutual friend about me. He was saying I was selfish for expecting him to pull his weight, and that I was a bad friend for not being more supportive. Hearing this shattered me, especially when trying to help him has put me in the position I am in.

I have thought about asking him to leave, but he has nowhere to go, and I don't want to be a bad friend. I also have been in a predicament of homelessness myself and had nowhere to go, so I know how down that can make you. But I also can't keep living like this. I have hinted at him to contribute more, but he gets defensive everytime. 

So, AITA for considering kicking him out? I feel so torn because he is my best friend, but I also have to look out for my own wellbeing.",0.0,0.007692664861679,0,1
16,1fj5n20,AITA for being angry with my husband for his new hobby,"AITA for being angry with my husband over his new hobby. 

I 33f have been married to 33m for almost 8 years but we've been together 12. Our relationship is ok. We fight like normal couples. Recently my husband has found some phone game I don't even know what it is and has gotten really into it. That's not the part I'm mad about. With this game comes a ""team"" or alliance of people. They have an in game chat and then apparently a discord on top of it which is the part I take issue with. 

Over the past few weeks my husband has been ""rewriting movies"" for story time in this chat. Like putting in hours of work for these stories. I let it go at first figuring it would die down and he'd move on like most phone games do. I woke up the other night in the middle of the night to him sitting in the pitch black of our living room chatting with these people on discord. He had come to bed with me so had gotten back up after I feel asleep.  There are two girls and at least one guy from this group. He told me he was almost done and to come back to sleep. At this point I'm on edge like wtf this is weird. He's loud (probably why I woke up) and annoyed. Another hour goes by and we get into a fight about it being 2am and him watching our kids tomorrow while I work. Finally around 2:40 he came back to bed. 

That day he did all kinds of chores he typically wouldn't start without being asked which put my guard up. That night when I was putting our oldest to bed he asked if I minded if he ""jumped on a call"" with these people. When I highlighted I wanted to hang out he put a time limit on it. I'm literally fucking fuming at this point. But it's what happened next that really irked me. 
Next day I take the girls do all kinds of things and finally everyone's asleep and we'd discussed watching a movie together. I get ""it's story time the people are waiting for their story"". Then I found out he rewrote the fucking Vow (that movie with Jennifer Lopez and Owen Wilson). I called him out on it and asked how that was appropriate and why these people matter more than spending time with his wife. He'd had all day to do whatever he wanted but now that I wanted his attention he's ""busy"". It ended with him continuing his story but us half heartedly watching a football game. When we went to bed he clued into the stupid discord just without talking. 

Same thing happened last night except when we went to bed we were just kinda doing our own thing. I went to go to sleep and he went to chat with his new discord friends. 

So for the last four nights (that I'm aware of) this discord has taken over the only child free time or sleeping time we've had. I've ask him to cut back and get the response ""people would say this healthier than me clued into a game without socialization"". These people have also encouraged him to buy a ps5 which we don't have the money for eight now. 

So I think I might be the asshole for asking my husband to cut back on his late night chats and story time with these people and more time with me.  ",TL;DR,2024-09-17,"AITA for being angry with my husband for his new hobby AITA for being angry with my husband over his new hobby.

17,1fj5mrm,AITA for finding my (21F) boyfriend's (21M) fake instagram?,"First of all sorry for the possibly bad english, not my first language. 
This started a year ago, he lost his phone so he used to use mine and had his Instagram open. I never went through his account, but one day I opened instagram to find his account open, so I changed it to mine but some kind of Instagram error happened and it showed me a box saying ""Error, the owner of the acount @redactedname might have changed the password"" 
That account was not his, but apparently another account connected to his main one.

At that time I searched the account name and saw his following (he wasn't following anyone) and his followers (had a couple of random followers, one of which was his hex)

I've been feeling self conscious and decided to look for the account again a couple weeks ago (bad desision, yes I know) he was following two girls with OF
I just saw the account again today and he is following a new girl, not an OF girl, seems like a random girl, he might know her I'm not sure

I don't know what to do, I know I shouldn't have looked at the account, but I already did and I feel like I can't ignore it 

Some extra context that I think is important:
About 6 months ago, I was at his house and he had Whatsapp web open, he was showing me something that his friend sent him and I saw on the left of the screen a chat with and unknown number (he didn't have it saved) 
I asked with what it was and he confessed it was a sex worker, he showed me the chat, it was only one deleted message. 
He tolded me he sent one message and deleted it because he regreted it. He admitted he had a problem with porn, that he never ment to really contact the girl, he just got some satisfaction sending the message when he was in that state of mind.

He told me his addiction was really affecting him mentally, that he wanted to change, that he wanted to tell me what he was going through.
I really thought he was changing this past few months, I was sure he would speak to me if he had some sort of relapse. Seems like I was wrong

should I speak to him about this or not?

I got home and the came out and yelled at me.l for 1.5 hours. I was told ‘majority rules’, that I ‘should just say yes when told something’, that there’s no compromise bc four ppl agreed to it  and that they wanted to evict me for two separate things. Both of which you can’t evict for (one is a protected code so think race gender etc). I was also mocked and made fun of by 10 people and when I called my boyfriend for support they asked if I was calling the police. They then wanted to escalate to management right then and there and I told them that management would say everyone gets stuff in the common area or no one does then one roommate decided on her own to move everything of there’s out of the common space just so I wouldn’t have mine in the space too. I told them that’s insane behaviour and to please keep it bc it looks lovely and that this was all ONE PERSONS choice. When she kept blaming me for not being able to have anything in the common area I had to keep reminding her that SHE CHOSE THAT over having TWO OF MY THINGS IN THAT SPACE. 

One of them was saying that management told her things that just weren’t true and when I disagreed I was told I was wrong… so I showed that emails to the more reasonable roommate after and told her my side of everything. The management is predatory and will tell them anything to get them in and then stop caring about the issues it causes bc they have their money already. She apologized for the other roommates behaviour and admitted some of what she said wasn’t ok.

After I went to my bedroom and shut the door the angry one kept yelling insults and things at me from the living room. 


Anyway, my pantry food is now just on the fridge bc every other drawer is used (there’s like 5) and I’m now sending a message to management to document bc they threatened to get me evicted, to throw out my things and yelled/mocked/insulted me for over an hour. 

Edit: 
They moved my things to put their in things in. I offered to move my printer to my room but want to keep my shoe rack with sone shoes and my pantry items out there. They literally moved my stuff to fit in stuff that didn’t fit in their bedrooms so commenting ‘Yta personal stuff should be in your roomi’ is hypocritical.





I’ve lived in my apartment for a few years and got a bunch of new roommates a few weeks ago. My previous roommates were very very messy and didn’t clean up after themselves and I was out of the country (my stuff was labled and moved into a corner so cleaners could clean. This didn’t happen bc my old roommates didn’t move out properly/clean their mess). I was out of the country when they moved in and when I got him I was told that they were decorating and to move my stuff out of the living room and kitchen. I told them no. I wasn’t asked to help with decor and wasn’t asked my opinion on anything.


Yesterday at work I got texts from them telling me they went through my food in the fridge/freezer and and asked me what they could throw out because the frozen stuff was ‘bad’. I had told them what stuff was mine a few days earlier. Much of it I had bought when I got back from my trip so it wasn’t ‘bad’. I then got texts of them telling me they all decided my stuff  wasnt nice enough to be in the common space and they moved it outside my room. I told them to put it back but they told me I have to compromise or they’ll keep moving it back to the hall. I have a shoe rack, 2-3 pairs of shoes, a printer and a plastic drawer set with pantry food in that space. I told them I’d move my printer to my room. They have moved a bunch of their item personal items into the common space (dressers, picturs, candles etc) They have already decorated and decided what stuff of theirs they want in that space and my stuff doesn’t fit their aesthetic. They told me of I move it back they keep moving it outside my room. I told them I can dust and re-organize my shoe rack to make it look nicer which wasn’t enough of a compromise . I told them to stop moving my things once I put them back  and they have also told me they will ‘settle this with management’. 

WIBTA for moving my stuff back? I feel like I’m being too stubborn since it’s 4 against one and they told me to use the old wooden clothing dresser they put in the living room for my food. I would rather keep my stuff separate since this isn’t my first time living with roommates and food can and does go missing. I also won’t be staying with them long (at my bfs 5-6 days a week and will likely move in with him in the new year).

22,1fj488k,AITA for ditching my friend in city with his FWB? ,"Two years ago, we were celebrating my friend Taylor's 24th birthday. We had been friends since we were 13. Taylor had gotten into some trouble, resulting in his license being suspended, and he was wearing an alcohol monitor, so he couldn’t drink. He wanted to go bowling, so he invited me, his girlfriend, and our friend Ashley. I also invited my friend Evan, who I had known for two years.
Taylor picked us all up, and we headed to a bowling alley about 35 minutes away. Since Taylor couldn’t drink, Ashley and I felt awkward drinking around him, but he encouraged us to go ahead. So, we had a few drinks. While we were there, another friend, Sarah, called and wanted to join. Sarah and Evan had a toxic, on-and-off friends-with-benefits relationship but claimed they were good. So Sarah arrived, and we all bowled. Most of the group, except for Taylor and me, got trashed.
Later, Taylor wanted to go to a bar, even though he couldn’t drink. I didn’t think it was a good idea, but everyone insisted, so I gave in. At the bar, Sarah and Evan kept disappearing. As the night ended, they were nowhere to be found. Taylor and Ashley tried calling them, but no one answered. Taylor decided to get gas while we waited.
Finally, Sarah called Ashley, apologizing and said they’re ready. So, we headed back to the bar. By the time we arrived, the bar was closing. Evan and Sarah were being escorted out by security, and I could see Evan arguing with them. I was annoyed, so I stayed in the car and had Ashley go get them. Sarah told me she would Uber to her mom’s place. I agreed, and Ashley tried to get Evan into the car, but he refused to sit in the back because of his ego. Taylor, without a license, was still sitting in the driver’s seat, and we were causing a scene outside of the bar. I yelled at everyone to get in the car, but Evan wouldn’t listen. Finally, I told Taylor to leave, and we left without them.
Since then, I haven’t spoken to Evan. He claims I was wrong for leaving him, saying he could have died. Apparently, he got into a fight at the bar while we got gas, and the other guys were still there. Despite his claims, I feel justified in my decision. First, it was Taylor’s birthday, and Evan’s behavior was putting him at risk. Taylor wasn’t supposed to be around alcohol or driving, and Evan was causing a scene that could have attracted the cops. Second, Sarah said she was Ubering back to her mom’s, so I assumed she could take Evan with her. It turned out her boyfriend was picking her up, and she freaked out because Evan was stuck with her. His brother ended up getting them. 
I never would’ve left Evan alone in the city, but because he was with Sarah, who said she was going to her mom’s place nearby, I didn’t think twice.

23,1fj44hi,WIBTA For choosing best friend over my only brother for my best man?,"My fiancée and I are starting to get boxes ready to send out to the bridesmaids and groomsmen to ask if they'd be in our wedding party. Currently, I'm stuck between choosing my best friend or my only brother who is four years older as the best man. 

A little background on my relationship with my brother is like one you hear about. We would do anything for each other no matter what, we talk almost once a week, and we see each other a couple times a year (1200 miles apart). A few major cons I have of him not being the best man is stealing money from not only me, but our grandmother, and not always being truthful and most recently is talking behind my back to my fiancée. Six years ago I was gearing up to return from the Middle East on a deployment and was working through my brother to send first, last and security deposit to him so he could write a check and deliver it to the apartment complex near him I was going to be moving to. After multiple lies from my brother saying he delivered the check, I was able to get approval to meet the apartment manager when I moved in to deliver the money. Jumping to the present, he has asked six of our family members including myself (our mother, our father, grandmother, an aunt, an uncle) for money over this past year. We all should have communicated but most of us lent him a few hundred to where my gram lent him a few thousand. When we all started talking, that's when we realized he had stolen from our grandmother almost $10k over three months to pay for mortgage, his kids soccer camps, and kids schooling. The one that hurts the most is he recently visited with his family and we were out drinking by the fire late when he talked badly about our uncle who I look up to a lot and he knows that. When I went to bed, my fiancée stayed up with my brother and his wife and that's when he warned her ""to watch out for how he turns out looking up to his uncle. His uncle is not a good man and cheats on his wife."" By the way, none of that is true as I hang out every weekend in the winter to ski with my uncle and fiancée. 

Now my best friend and I have been friends since before we could walk, and he was actually the first person I thought of when my fiancée asked who will be my best man. We grew up together playing sports, working together as camp counselors, partying in college, and most recently doing plenty of double dates with his wife (who my fiancée has now even chosen to be as a bridesmaid). The most important thing is when I found my fiancée, she became close friends with his wife and we went on double dates golfing, sports games, and we even started a couple's retreat we do each winter to a ski resort with any of our friends. My fiancée and I say this all the time, but he's one of those guys that you can tell will be the greatest dads ever cause he will do anything and everything for his kids and that speaks volumes to us.

25,1fj3g6m,AITA for claiming and using my raffle prize?,"AITA for claiming and using my raffle prize?

Throw away account because I’m a coward and my world already has enough drama.

I have a coworker who is very interested in charity. We are in a common group chat, and she was raising money for her latest cause. I donated in the form of purchasing a few raffle tickets for a reasonable price, not really expecting to win because I’m an exceptionally normal person and normal people never win.

Well lo and behold, I won two tickets to a major league sporting event held in a nearby major city. My husband and I were very excited to go, as we are big fans of the team. The tickets themselves aren’t anything special (not like box seats or anything like that). It’s just cool that we got the tickets for the small price of a couple raffle tickets.

The contest was back in July, but the game is in the near future, and now the drama is rearing its ugly head.

My coworker, who purchased the tickets themselves, recently made a post on social media about how she could be going to her first ever live game, but instead chose to raffle off the tickets. She said she made out well with the proceeds, but seemed kind of morose and regretful. She tagged me in the post and wished me a good time, but I kind of felt like maybe this was her passive aggressive way of saying she would like her tickets back.

I sent a screenshot to some mutual friends to ask if they had seen the post, and without prompting they responded with the same concerns I had, which was “Wtf is she trying to say? Is she ticket shaming you?” She also sent me a message saying, “Have a good time.” Please note the use of the cursed Period of Passive Aggression, as opposed to the Exclamation Point of Feigned Joy for the Good Fortune of Others. 

Everyone thinks it’s silly of my coworker to act this way, and that it’s kind of shady to maybe try to shame me out of going (even if that’s not her stated intention, which it isn’t, but seems to be strongly indicated by some sort of guilt trip, which is kind of working). The game is very soon and I have no intention of giving the tickets back, or taking her instead of my husband, or anything like that.

Honestly, I just wanted to donate to my coworker’s charitable cause. I didn’t sign up for the guilt trip.

26,1fj34vm,AITA for calling my boyfriend’s siblings out?,"I (21F) have been dating my boyfriend (26M) for over a year. I moved in with him and his family in March after being kicked out by my host family, as I have no family here. Initially, I had a good relationship with his siblings: his brother (23M) and sister (20F). My boyfriend owns a calm cat, and his siblings got a very active kitten, Gigi, last December.

Initially, they took good care of Gigi, but their attention waned quickly. His sister was often with her long-distance boyfriend, and his brother started going out all day. After a month or two, my boyfriend and I ended up handling most of Gigi's care, including getting food and cleaning the litter. We don’t mind, as we love the cats, but it’s frustrating when his siblings don’t meet their responsibilities and often forget to help. When I’ve raised this before, I’ve been met with anger and name-calling.

The main issue arose today when Gigi was spayed. We dropped her off at 8 am, and when I woke up at 2 pm after a nap, I found out that my boyfriend's siblings had left to see their dad (who lives overseas) and won’t return for two days. They didn’t inform us in advance, and my boyfriend and I were left to handle Gigi’s post-surgery care. This was especially difficult because Gigi needed a lot of attention, and we had made our own plans.

I was overwhelmed and messaged them, expressing how unfair it was to leave us with the responsibility and asked if they could at least come home at night so we could get some rest. They responded by calling us “dramatic” and insisted we shouldn’t make a big deal out of “just 2 days.” Their mother intervened, telling them to return home or face eviction. This led to a huge argument, and their brother insisted he did nothing wrong and labeled me as rude and disrespectful and basically requested me to get out of here. Their sister, on the other hand, threatened to move in with her boyfriend and did not want to return home.

While I may have been harsh, my intention was to be acknowledged and not treated as unimportant. I feel disrespected and unappreciated for all the care I’ve given Gigi.

I told her I’m sorry (I really am, I can absolutely see how me not wearing them while still complaining of not having clothes can make her sad), but I honestly don’t like how tight they are on me, so I feel there’s nothing really I can do except keep trying to lose weight.

I’m not really the kind of person that likes buying clothes, especially now that it’s hard to find one that I like. So, while I keep complaining about having no clothes, I don’t do anything about it and for that I recognize that I’m wrong

Now, my birthday was in July and my girlfriend gave me some really nice shirts, unfortunately they didn’t fit all that well on me. Of course I thanked her A LOT, because I really liked them and promised myself I would lose some weight so I could wear them.

The problem is that since then, I haven’t lost any weight and not used any of the new shirts. My gf pointed that out yesterday and said she’s feeling kinda sad because of it.

I told her I’m sorry (I really am, I can absolutely see how me not wearing them while still complaining of not having clothes can make her sad), but I honestly don’t like how tight they are on me, so I feel there’s nothing really I can do except keep trying to lose weight.

When it comes to people cooking us meals, and bringing them over, we’ve been lucky and appreciative there too. Most people have sent gift cards since we live in NYC and basically no one has a car to bring meals over. 

This brings me to why I’m here. My sister-in-law has also been very supportive and close. It turns out she cooked a meal for us yesterday. But she wants us to pick it up from her despite us not having a car (she doesn’t have one either).

What makes it odder is that she’s actually somewhat nearby today looking at new apartments and bringing the dish with her for us to pick up. But it’s a 30 minute walk each way from us (or a subway or Uber). 

We’re both busy with work and taking care of the baby and it’s a lot to pick up this dish later. 

WIBTA for saying thanks, but we’re unavailable to do so? My worry is that it could turn into a whole thing and wondering if I should just suck it up and head all the way over.

32,1fizyv5,AITA for threatening to not attend my paid wedding?,"So I 26m and my fiancée 26f have been engaged since last year. We’ve been planning for the wedding since, it’s settled next year march. 

My fiancée family is very doting on her, made it clear to me several times how they only treat me like family because she loves me. For the sake of this story, I will just call them ILs.

Me and my fiancée actually had our own plans for our wedding, but because my parents kind of paid for the house we are living in, her parents insisted to pay for the wedding. Although she did told me they had intentions to, I didn’t know it was going to be for everything.

At first everything was fine, we wanted a venue but we compromise to something agreeable like another venue because my ILs fancied it more and we could take it aesthetic wise. Or maybe instead of pink flowers they wanted purple, I found it tacky but sure.

Problem came when I got the invitation list. 300 people? I’ve always made it clear I preferred an intimate wedding but out of respect for my fiancée and her family I did compromise with her to go maybe 200 and even then, how do you even get 200 people to come to your wedding??

I pulled her aside and I was asked her whether she knew anyone she said maybe 80 people. The rest were relatives. She could tell I was restless and tried to assure me by cutting some. But she seems to not really understand why I’m nervous cause “it’s all paid”.

We went back in and ask my ILs whether we could cut down the size but my ILs were adamant saying that weddings are sacred and everyone should witness the union of our bond? My sister scoffed from the side and made a snarky comment on how we didn’t need every neighbour to come get some free food to show our love and my ILs were pissed. They said this number were already disrespecting their daughter and I should man up and face a crowd. I’m a bit introverted. They also commented since they are paying they should have a say in who they want to invite.

That kind of triggered and I retaliated by saying that this was my wedding and if they insist on this amount of people, I as the groom, will simply not go.

They were shocked since I usually don’t lose my temper, I’m a very mild tempered man. My fiancée looked at me disappointed and so did my ILs, they just left and haven’t contacted me.

I really don’t know if that was asshole of me considering the whole wedding is paid and my ILs have been working tirelessly to make our wedding perfect.

Edit: me and my fiancé are on the same page. She’s just more understanding of a bigger wedding than a small one cause that’s what she’s used to. And even if she doesn’t necessarily understand me she was fully ready to support me. I didn’t add that in but she was reassuring and supporting me. She did try to gently coax me to change my mind but when I said no, she was fully ready to fight my ILs for it. I usually don’t react like this but life’s been a bit stressful lately so that’s been a really out of nature reaction for me.

Add on, I have really bad anxiety, hyperventilating kind, like I said me and my wife had this conversation before, while she’s more understanding of a big wedding she prefers a smaller wedding without relatives too. The quota of guest was conveyed very clearly to them.

Also my fiancé just text me, basically verbatim “wrong move bitch” “now I got to clean this mess up” “you better prepare my ice cream with strawberries when I’m back” but she did assure me that she will absolutely keep it at 200 even if it meant that she’s getting skinned. I will show her the post when she’s back

Guys she saying that as a joking way, we always text like this jokingly. 

Fiancée here, no we don’t have any problems, my guy is just stressed and I know him well. That threat was more directed to my parents than me. I didn’t feel hurt whatsoever, I just needed to play along with them. For those blaming me not cutting ties with my family you have problems lol. Not everything is solved by no contact and not everything is worthy of a no contact. And yeah. We are going to save it for the honeymoon, it’s a free wedding. Did either of me or my fiancé wanted it?

She asked why and I pointed out the three of u are pretty much spending more time together than just me and my gf. She tried to downplay it and said it wasn't as bad as I was claiming. 

She said her cousin doesn't have a lot of friends to spend time with. I said it's obviously sad she doesn't have a lot of people to go out with but that doesn't mean she always has to be joining us. 

I said if she wants to spend time with her cousin she can make separate plans with her instead of inviting her to join us. My girlfriend just said I was being unfair but I told her it was unfair to expect me to be fine without dates basically turning into babysitting.

34,1fiznkp,AITA for refusing to dropout of my driving classes?,"My boyfriend (M29) and I (F25) have been fighting about this issue non stop so i thought l'd bring it here to receive some feedback from impartial strangers. 

For a bit of backstory, my oldest brother passed away on a car accident when I was 15. I became a completely different after that happened, I turned into a shell of my former self and developed a crippling fear of driving which stopped me from ever getting my drivers license.

Fast forward to now, my boyfriend and I have been dating for 6 years and have started to discuss marriage and kids. These conversations made me reminisce a lot on who I used to be before my brother passed and I since vowed to become that person I once was again, as I feel like my future kids deserve it. I also feel like my future kids deserve to be picked up and dropped off for their fun activities and I didn't want to leave that burden solely on my boyfriend. So I feel like this was a selfless step really, as not having a drivers license never was more than a minor inconvenience in my life. 

I specifically chose the smallest private driving school near me so that there would be less students and I could have a more personal learning experience. Turns out such a small school also has a small staff team, including just one driving instructor (M26). From the beginning, I explained all my driving related fears to him and he understood them right away and assured me we would take things easy and slow until I was comfortable. His easy and slow method really helped me and I can now say I am comfortable enough behind the wheel. He would make classes fun and soon enough wasn't nervous anymore when I walked into the driving school. Soon enough it also became quite apparent the raging crush he developed on me. He never bothered to hide it from me either, but I also never hid the fact that I had a boyfriend.

I told my boyfriend about my instructors crush and he made it into a way bigger deal than it was. He was livid like I had never seen before and it honestly scared me. He asked me if I told him why I started taking classes in the first place, meaning if I told him about the accident and the future kids plan. I said no because he's just my driving instructor and I didn't feel the need to make the classes personal like that. He said they were already ""as personal as it gets"" because of the instructors crush and demanded screening that I either tell the instructor or dropout of the school entirely. I refused and explained the reasons I chose that school to begin with and that I also hate to tell people about what happened with my brother because it makes me feel sad and look like a victim.

I feel like due to the circumstances I am not the asshole here. The instructor hasn't made a move and if he ever were to I would leave the school immediately, but I know he won't so I feel like there is no need as I am honestly becoming a really good driver thanks to him. So, AlTA?

36,1fiyj8j,AITA for wanting more colour in a communal living area? ,"For context, my boyfriend (30M) and I (29F) are about to move in with another couple (27F and 28M). 

We’ve found a house, signed the paperwork and paid our deposit so now we’re having discussions on what we need to buy for the house in the next 6 weeks before we officially move in. 

This evening the 4 of us sat down to make a list of what we want/need to buy for the house and 27F produced a long list of things she’s already got for the house. The list mainly consisted of kitchen stuff (toaster, kettle, blender etc) but also some stuff for the living room (coffee tables that were apparently made especially for the house, along with a couch). She communicated that she was happy for these to be communal items. 

When the conversation shifted to soft furnishings, she proceeded to show us a 3d rendering she had made of the living room in the new house (she’s an interior designer so I’m assuming she has access to this software through her work). 

The rendering showed her couch superimposed into the space along with several of the  “$200 cushions” she had selected for said couch 

The design was professional, minimalist (her words not mine) and the colours depicted were muted. It was the kind of thing you’d see in a fancy showroom. 

While I’ll admit that my style/taste is the complete opposite of this, all 4 of us had previously commented on how dark the space was (the wall in this particular room is painted dark). Based of this I was honest and communicated that I thought the room might benefit from some more bright vivid colours. 

I then put forward some ideas of my own, and as I was talking I could see and feel her energy shifting. 

She said that she’s been wanting to decorate with this couch for a long time, that she didn’t like too many bright colours, that her OCD can’t handle it and repeated that she’s an interior designer. 

My response was that I do like bright colours, that we may have to accept that we have differing opinions and when I asked if I could put colourful coasters on her tables and colourful cushions on her couch, she replied “I suppose” 

Throughout the conversation she was red in the face and avoiding eye contact - clearly bothered by me wanting to add my own personal touches. I asked more than once if she was okay, at one point I even apologised for upsetting her but the conversation ended with her leaving the table to go into her boyfriends room, slamming a door in the process. 

Her reaction makes me feel like I’m the villain here but it also bugs me that we’re expected to be fine with her bringing what she likes to the house but it’s a problem when we even propose doing the same?

Me and my partner have previously shut down conversations with my brother-in-law about us getting married because we don't believe in marriage and we don't want to either. It's also very creepy that my brother-in-law was so hell-bent on the idea of it for us. I've known him for all of five conversations and I believe my marriage status is none of his business. 

I was very upset about the comments in the group chat and also that nobody in the family called out the comment in any way. So I messaged my mum and asked her to comment that we don't need to talk about this in the group chat and I didn't want to ruin my relationship with my sister. My mum went behind my back and spoke to my sister and my sister called me to apologise, only she didn't apologise because she didn't understand why the comments were offensive to me and why I was hurt, instead she dug in her heels about it and said I overeacted. And now my sister is no longer speaking to me for a comment that her husband made that humilated me.

38,1fixqkz,AITA for refusing to help out with my dad's new wife's kids like I help with my siblings?,"My dad got married 4 months ago and his new wife has three kids (7, 5 and 4). Dad has me (16m) and my siblings (13f, 11f, 9m). Our mom died 5 years ago. Not sure about the other kids dad(s?). They don't have anything to do with their dad(s).

My relationship with my dad has been strained for years. I have a plan I put into place last year to get me out as soon as I'm 18. I don't want a relationship with my dad. I don't want to fix things or to make the most of things for now. I just want to keep my eye on the prize. But I help my siblings when I need to. Sometimes it's walking them to school (don't have a car). Sometimes it's buying them a little something. Sometimes it's helping with homework. Or getting them some food. Or picking them up from some place. It's not all the time. Though I do buy them little snacks or whatever if they want to walk home with me instead of taking the bus. Just for some sibling time and to spoil them a little since dad was never into that.

My dad's wife has a problem that I still do this stuff for my siblings but I don't do a thing for her kids. I don't even really talk to them unless they talk to me first. She has asked me to pick them up or feed them lunch once or twice and I say no. Since going back to school I was asked to help all the kids with homework and not just my siblings even though they do their homework in different rooms (my siblings in my room, the new wife's kids in the kitchen). 

But the most controversial was when I walked my siblings home from school and bought them ice cream on the way. I didn't get anything for the other kids. And I didn't try to take the others with me. Just my siblings.

So dad and his wife sat me down a few days ago and told me I should treat all the kids the same and should be willing to help them all. I said no. I said I won't. She argued that this would be a good way to form a stronger family connection. I told her there is no family connection and there will never be. She and her kids are not my family just like HE isn't (dad). I told her the only family I have in their house is my siblings and they won't change my mind. She wanted to know if I'd go to therapy with them and give it a chance and I said no. Dad was already doing other stuff by that point. She told me we could make it work and her kids would love to have me as a big brother. And by doing some stuff every now and again could be nice. I said no. She didn't like that and told me I'm old enough to know and do better.

39,1fiwy6x,AITA for telling my friend that I’m sorry her parents don’t love her as much as mine love me?,"I (22F) have a friend named Amy (22F) who I met in college. Currently we are in our last semester of college. I live alone, but she shares her apartment with two other people. 

We never really spoke about our finances much, but I know that both of our parents currently pay our rent. The issue started when we talked about our future plans.

I told her that I’m probably going to get a job and do my Master’s at the same time so that I can save up a little but also to finally have my own money to spend on some things that I love and to travel. She laughed at me and asked me what kind of salary I expect while working part-time to be able to afford all that.

I shrugged and said I didn’t have any expenses that I’d need to cover really, just food and that’s it. She looked shocked and asked me about rent and stuff and I said ny parents will be paying for it. She then went on a rant about becoming an adult, how she can’t wait to be independent, how she doesn’t want to take money from her parents and stuff like that. For the most part I tried to nod my head and listen to her, but then she said something like “I’d feel like a bad daughter if I were you.” And that really made me feel embarrassed.

My parents want to pay for my apartment, they can easily afford it and I’m not the type of person to be ungrateful for it. I spend a lot of time with them, I know they don’t lack money for anything, they travel, own their house, have a good retirement plan. They don’t mind paying for me and I don’t mind taking it. We have a good relationship.

I know this won’t be forever and I don’t expect it to be. Just a few years until I finish my degree and get a higher paying job. 

I got annoyed and told her to drop it, we can talk about something else but she continued talking about how her parents want her to be a real adult, how I’ll never want to be ambitious unless I struggle and just more and more nonsense. (Not sure how important it is, but between the two of us, my grades are significantly better and I’m a few exams ahead of her in terms of passing this semester) 

I just cut her off and said “Well, I don’t know, maybe my parents love me more than yours love you so they want to pay. I’m sorry for that. Can we now talk about something else?” 

We didn’t talk since and I do feel bad because I know that love has nothing to do with money and looking back, it’s such a rude thing to say, but I just said it to shut her up because she was insulting me and calling me spoiled for no reason. I wasn’t even the one to start this conversation nor did I probe into her finances. She was the one who kept it going. Ever since that day I feel a pit in ny stomach and I really didn’t want to insult her.

INFO/EDIT: just adding some stuff because I feel like it may be relevant.

I feel like Amy’s intention wasn’t genuine because she currently accepts her parents paying rent, food, utilities, everything. So do I. The conversation was about after college.

I mention my academic success because she said I will never be ambitious when I try really hard.

We also don’t live in the USA, and parents support isn’t so uncommon. 
And lastly, while this may not convince people, I really do appreciate my parents and everything they do for me.

40,1fiwet1,AITA for refusing to change my daughter's name or give my half sister's daughter the stuffy from my grandma?,"Sorry if the title is a little confusing. Here's the situation with background included. I (26f) was only 3 or 4 when my father married my stepmother. I had no mother in my life or no family from my father. My stepmother and most of her family did not accept me as theirs though. To be perfectly honest neither did my father. He always treated me like a burden or like I chose to make his life more difficult by daring to be born.

The exception to all this was my grandma, who was my stepmother's mom. She embraced and loved me as her granddaughter even among her bio grandkids. I was always equal to her and some people accused her of favoring me above the ""real grandkids"". When my half sister was born this caused so many issues because she refused to treat me as less even after that. My half sister hated it when we were growing up because her parents would make such a fuss out of it. She was always so jealous. Even though grandma loved and treated her well too. I think everyone had this expectation that if I was a grandkid too, that meant she loved the real ones less. I know grandma fought with the whole family over their disregard for me. She even confronted my father on acting like I had any choice in being born. But he didn't care. Nobody did. Nobody changed their behavior toward me. And my half sister and grandma became a bit estranged when my half sister entered her teens because my half sister became very demanding that grandma ignore me, she insulted grandma for letting me play with her (grandma's) childhood stuffy but never letting anyone else play with it. She told grandma to leave me out of the will. She told grandma I wasn't a real member of the family. Grandm was so disappointed in her for being so bratty about it and she saw her less, which pissed my father and stepmother off.

When grandma got sick she publicly announced that she was gifting me her childhood stuffy and that she wanted me to have it for my future children as a memory of her. It pissed everyone off but she did it before she died. Grandma also told me, after I had mentioned wanting to name a future child after her, that she would be honored. She also encouraged me to break free from our so called family without shame. Which I did once she died. That was three years ago.

I gave birth to my daughter a few weeks ago. After announcing her birth and name on social media I had my half sister (now 20f) reach out to me through different platforms and through an old number to cuss me out and tell me I stole the name from her. That she's due in several weeks and was going to name her daughter after grandma and how fucking dare I use the name for someone who wasn't my family. She called me all kinds of names. I hung up on her instead of listening. But then more contact came through different platforms and blocking seemed to be evaded on some of them.

- I bought a house solo (no help, poor background), in February. 
- Father decided to come over. And stay with me.

You may be able to guess what happened: half way into the visit, cat's gone. I'm having to cancel work from home meetings to go look for him. Wild stress. This cat is the joint most important thing in my life.

In seventh and eighth grade evryone in the theater class is in the same group but in ninth grade we are divided into two different groups, and me and my best friend were not in the same group which i was actually happy about it because she is not a good actress and she always talks to me instead of listening and i cant hear the teacher.

Now dont get me wrong, i really like being with my friend but not in the theater class. So in the start of the year when we were separated i was happy but didn't wanted her to know.

But when she was in elementary school (i didn't know her yet) she was bullied and had no friends unlike me. So except one friend we have that is not in theater class she has no friends. And the two of the people in her group were the kids who bullied her in elementary school.
 
Then she complained to the teacher and he said hes goona swap the groups. He told each one of us to write on a piece of paper two kids you would like to be with and two you dont so i wrote her in the one i don't want to be with.

Today we were sorted in the new groups and i was with the people i wrote i dont want to be with and without the people i do want to be with.

I'm not planning on participating in the class until the teacher will see he sorted me in the opposite of what i asked and do somthing about it.

They've recently started allowing 16 year old in for the quizzes as long as they are with an adult. We went to the quiz last week and my girlfriend asked me if she could bring her 16 year old cousin as the theme was something the cousin really liked.  and I was fine with it.

Her cousin I'd argue looks slightly younger than her age. We got to the bar and it was going well. I went to the bar to get the drinks in and a guy who looked like he was in his mid 30s asked if my gf's cousin is single. I told him she was 16 so wasn't even an adult and walked away. 

Later in the night he asked the same things again. I reminded him she was a child and told him to back off. He didn't listen and approached the table to ask if he could buy the cousin a drink. At this point I just loudly asked if he often offered to buy children drinks and ask if they're single.

He started shouting that he wasn't doing that but I pointed out it's very clear he was. I asked the staff if they could remove him and they agreed. The person he was with came over to apologise but asked if I would change my mind about wanting him kicked out and that it was an overreaction. 

I told him it wasn't an overreaction and maybe she should stop defending a guy who tried to chat up children. The entire group was told to leave and the second guy kept going on about how it was an overreaction and they shouldn't have to leave.

Her cousin I'd argue looks slightly younger than her age. We got to the bar and it was going well. I went to the bar to get the drinks in and a guy who looked like he was in his mid 30s asked if my gf's cousin is single. I told him she was 16 so wasn't even an adult and walked away. 

Later in the night he asked the same things again. I reminded him she was a child and told him to back off. He didn't listen and approached the table to ask if he could buy the cousin a drink. At this point I just loudly asked if he often offered to buy children drinks and ask if they're single.

He started shouting that he wasn't doing that but I pointed out it's very clear he was. I asked the staff if they could remove him and they agreed. The person he was with came over to apologise but asked if I would change my mind about wanting him kicked out and that it was an overreaction. 

I told him it wasn't an overreaction and maybe she should stop defending a guy who tried to chat up children. The entire group was told to leave and the second guy kept going on about how it was an overreaction and they shouldn't have to leave.

45,1fivf16,AITA for not defending my friend when my fiancé was mean to her.,"I 26m have been engaged to my fiancé Zaira 26f for six months now. We were friends in highschool and only started dating when we were around 22. We were close in highschool( we were in the same friend group) but drifted apart and reconnected in uni so it’s safe to say I do know her really well. She’s a kind person most of the time. However she knows how to cut deep when the situation warrants it. I’ve witnessed it at times and she can make people cry. 

So one of my friend groups mostly consists of gamers. I don’t hangout  with them in person that much because I’m not very social and prefer spending time with my fiancé. Even during calls I’m mostly muted or don’t talk but I do enjoy their company, I guess I’m just shy. My friends know I have a fiancé and they invited her out with us last night. There are girls in our friend group like two of them and this other girl in our group who can be a bit of a pick me girl. I’ll call her emma. She gets along well with the rest of us but sometimes she can be a bit annoying. 

So last night we all went out to dinner and the other two girls and my girl were getting along really well. They really hit it off until Emma joined us later in the evening. She started of making passive aggressive backhanded comments to Zaira who intially just rolled her eyes and laughed but I told Emma to stop because I didn’t want the night to end with someone crying. She took this as a joke but stopped messing with Zaira for a while and then she started up again. I think she was trying make my fiancé insecure or jealous or something but Emma kept saying how close we are because we game. Zaira knows I’m not close with her because every time I play with them she is either in my lap or right next to me watching me play. Emma told Zaira not to worry about her because she wasn’t going to take me away from her. Zaira smiled at her and I knew the night was over. She looked Emma up and down and said ‘you, take him from me? Good luck.’ Emma tried defending herself and brushing it off as a joke but Zaira just kind of let loose I guess. She called Emma a pathetic excuse of a woman and asked if she needs male validation that desperately or if she’s actually deluded enough to think she(Emma) is more important than her (Zaira) in my life, among other things. I’m not going to lie, I do kind of think it’s hot when she gets like this so I just sat by and watched and Emma started crying and we left after she said thank you to the rest of my friends. 

The girls in my group have been messaging me and saying I should’ve stopped Zaira and maybe not have let her be so rude and Emma has gone radio silent. My other friends think Zaira is justified and I do too but did she take it too far and should I have stopped her? Aita 

Hi, so I have no idea how to update so I'm just going to write it here and hopefully people will read it. I wanna thank everyone who told me I wasn't an a-hole and neither was zaira. I knew we weren't wrong I just wanted an unbiased opinion. A lot people seem to think that zaira is a horrible woman who kicks puppies or something. I said that she can make people cry and everyone just assumed she just regularly goes out and makes people cry. She's made like three people cry, four if you count Emma but I'm 100% certain those were crocodile tears. Also my other friends in the group have decided they want some space from Emma and the other girls. Alot of people said zaira is trying to isolate me when it's in fact the opposite, if it wasn't for her I wouldn't even have these friends because I frankly have no interest in making a lot of friends. I also said that I think that zaira is hot when she gets assertive and stands up for herself and so many people were acting like I said something so gross and disgusting which was weird, like I'm sorry I think my fiancee is hot. Do you want me to hate her or something?

Onto the update. We spent the morning reading the comments (it's her day off) and zaira thinks you're all kind and funny. I've decided I'm just going to put some distance between myself and the girls. I have other friends so I'll be fine. Plus were getting married in November so I have better things to worry about and look forward to.

I am (generally) a clean person but I don't devote my life to it and if things are out of place or a bit different around my house, that's just how it is and I'm comfortable with that. 

I've lived alone for two years. 
My parents have offered to decorate my house and consult with me on it, which is fine. Everything I've picked I'm happy with. They don't have to do it. I offer them food and drink. Generally it's lovely and I appreciate it. 

But they constantly complain about my house, if things are untidy or out of place. They plug and unplug things. If things aren't up to their standards they moan at me and most likely behind my back also. 

I want them to leave and to not be around them half the time but feel indebted to them because they do nice things for me. I have five siblings who would more than likely gang up on me because they adore my parents and while I do, I don't have any idolisation. I see they're flawed and I know I'm flawed but whenever I go to my parents house, if it's not how I want it to be, I bite my tongue. I believe in a live and let live approach and that relaxed discussion is better than demanding one. I've spoken to my parents before about this and just been told I'm too sensitive.

47,1fiusfw,AITA for writing an email to my manager about my colleague?,"So I've been working at a menswear store for about 7 months now. It's just my manager, my colleague, and myself. My colleague and I are both casuals with the same position in the store, he has been at the store and extra 6 or so months.

Basically, my colleague is a bit nuts, he's always behind me changing everything I've just done, say I moved a jacket somewhere, he'll move it elsewhere, or I'll straighten some pants, he'll be behind me moving them himself. He never trusts me doing things on the computer (he is essentially computer illiterate).

We all normally work days alone, but the backstory of my colleague is important. When he works alone, he even calls my manager a minimum 6 times a day (my manager showed me the logs). 

The main issue I'm fed up with is that my colleague always reverses the work that I do. My manager asks me to do tasks, the main one, ensuring trousers hang equally over the hanger it's on; so I did that, all 250 trousers. Next day, completely reversed by my colleague (as in he makes them unequal).

My manager told him not to do that, and asked me to do it again; I did. Next day, all reversed again. Time went by and I fixed them up again, and I was in on a day my colleague was, and I noticed that he was starting to reverse the trousers again, so I politely said to him that the manager would like the trousers to hang equally much like the other stores. And he got really angry at me that I was saying that to him, and he attempted to stand over me.

My manager asked me to do the trousers again, and he said he'd talk to my colleague sternly to not touch the trousers. And now today, I walk into work, and again, he reveresed the trousers!

Would I be an arsehole to write an email report to my manager, I'm sick of my colleague doing this. I know it's my job on the day to make the store perfect, but when I do, he changes it back.

49,1fiuqks,AITA for still holding a grudge against my boyfriend and his family? ,"I will try to be as brief and clear as possible, and I can provide further information if needed.

I (32F) have been with my boyfriend (31M) for a little over two and a half years now. He is a loving and caring partner;  his family, though generally nice to me, are extremely verbally abusive toward each other (mainly his father and his older sister). 

His father even threatened to physically hurt his mother once.

This doesn't sit right with me. I know it's not my place to change their dynamics, and I understand that we should love people as they are and that no one chooses their family. However, abuse toward women is a big no-no for me. So, **I talked to my boyfriend about it**, explaining why I wanted to keep some distance from them. He got furious at his father and started ranting about him to me.

Fast forward to this summer:

We all live in Paris,France, his family however owns a ***small*** beach house (322 ft²) that my boyfriend was eager to take me to, so he announed to his family earlier this year that he ""reserved"" the house for us.

 They also inherited a larger flat, a 10-minute walk from the house. The parents announced they would stay in the flat with a couple of friends while we stayed at the beach house.a couple of days later my boyfriend's sister announced that she was also coming with her parents to the flat.

 Then, just two days before our departure, the sister informed my boyfriend that she, her husband, their 3-year-old son, and their cat would all be joining us in the beach house as they could no longer stay in the flat.

My boyfriend was (rightfully) upset, and so was I. My summer plans were completely ruined. We quickly booked another hotel in a different city for the week, which I hated having to do. We ended up driving back and forth to his parents' place and having dinner with the whole family. 

During dinner, his sister apologized to him. I was seated in front of my boyfriend, and she was next to him. She said, ""I'm sorry, A"" (A being my boyfriend's initial) three times.

Not once did she apologize to me—neither she nor her husband. A brushed the whole thing off, and now he just wants everything to go back to normal.

after the summer vacation was dne, we all got back in our city, last weekend, he went to his parents' place, where his sister and her family were also invited for lunch. I declined the invitation and told him that I need an apology, at least from his sister.

He changed the subject and started telling me how hurt he feels when he shows up alone at his parents' house. that he doesn't want to stir more problems in his family, that they apologized and promised it would never happen again. 

I, however, still feel I need a form of apology from his sister, because I too suffered her non-organisation!

On the other hand,  I feel awful for making him feel bad.

He is now of pensionable age and get a full state pension as well as other benefits. 
Dad is divorced but him and my mother have a “good-ish” relationship. 
Recently mum has started doing the cleaning for dad and taking him shopping once a week which she gets paid for.  However Dad has been showing her his bank accounts and now mum feels she should be entitled to half of his pension and some of the lump sum he received.  
Mum always has some sob story to get money out of him whenever she goes round to clean.  Last week it was two new tyres at £250 the week before it was £200 for shopping the list is endless and he always hands her over the money.

My brother has now asked if Dad can pay half the airfare to get her over to Australia for Christmas I have said No. All my brothers and sisters are on my mums side and think that it’s only right for dad to look after her.

53,1fitsve,AITA for suggesting my friend doesn't rush out of one relationship and into another with someone from another country.,"Hey y’all, I’m feeling a bit conflicted and could really use some outside input. I’m pretty sure I’m in the right, but I’m open to other perspectives.

I \[F34\] have been close friends with Lucy, \[F32\], for over a decade. We’ve worked together nearly as long and live just down the street from each other. I care about her deeply and have been worried about her lately.

Lucy met her husband Mike \[M37\] about three years ago. Things seemed fine at first, but after about a year, Lucy started to show signs of depression. Then she announced she was pregnant and getting engaged. I was happy for her because she’s always wanted kids and is great with her daughter, but Mike never quite sat right with me or my husband. 

Our feelings about him only grew over time, as Lucy became more miserable and he seemed to care less and less. Lucy seemed to brighten up only when she was with friends or having a laugh at work, but there was a sadness about her that wasn’t typical. 

Since their baby arrived, she’s been overwhelmed. Mike doesn’t help much at home, preferring to watch sports and hang out with friends, leaving Lucy to handle everything. Without the support of her parents and us, she’d be completely stretched.

However, recently, I noticed Lucy was more cheerful and always on her phone. She’d light up with every notification, clearly excited by someone she was talking to.

When I asked her about it, she told me she’s been chatting with Dave \[M38\]. They started talking on Reddit about a year ago after an innocent post comment. They kept chatting but in recent months their conversations have become a daily thing. Even though they’re in different countries, they’re staying up late and waking up early just to talk. 

She's let me read most of their messages, which are mostly just friendly and supportive, with some light flirting, but nothing explicit.

Lucy’s obviously smitten with Dave. She’s happier now than I’ve seen her in a long time. They seem to share similar ideals, music tastes, hobbies, and dreams for the future. 

She’s talked to me before about moving back to her childhood home, which is quite rural. I don't think she's said this to Dave, but I can see he has mentioned he’d like a similar lifestyle eventually.

Yesterday on the ride to work, Lucy told me she wants to leave Mike, move back home, and invite Dave to come live with her and start a relationship. 

I’m torn. I don’t want her to move away, but if it’s what’s best for her, I’d support it. However, I felt this is all to fast.  
I suggested she should deal with leaving Mike first, get herself settled and then see about meeting Dave in person before making any big decisions.

Lucy seemed hurt by my response and said she expected more support from me. She’s been distant since then and I woke up just now to a test saying she’d be late to work today so don't worry about car sharing.

I feel like some context is needed to accurately describe our situation. When I was 15 my older brother passed away in a car accident and it threw me into a depression where I became very overweight. He was my best friend and meant the world to me, losing him lead me into the worst years of my life. 

A few months after I turned 18 I met Adam, he was one of my friends older brother and we hit it off. He's smart, charismatic and I loved his sense of humor. Adam is also heavy but he was so comfortable in his skin it really made me admire his confidence. I couldn't stand to even look at myself in a mirror so this last year I buckled down and lost a very significant amount of weight and now I'm even below my highschool weight. I've never been this fit in my life and I feel so good about myself. 

My 21st birthday was this last Saturday and Adam and my friends had planned a party for me. Unfortunately Adam had a family emergency so he wasn't going to be around for my birthday. I was okay with this and reassured him that it was fine when I drove him to the airport. My friend Andrea recommended that we should instead go to a strip club and I thought that was an amazing idea. The next time i talked to Adam I told him about the change in plans and he was very adamant that he didn't want me to go. He said it wasn't that he didn't trust me it's that he didn't trust my friends. I ended up dropping the subject to not cause him further stress and we ended up just having the party they originally planned. 

Adam arrived today and I felt something was off, something has been off since I lost weight. I kept badgering him until he finally opened up. We talked and he eventually told me that we don't even look like we belong together anymore. He brought up an instance where we were at the grocery store a week ago and a guy was asking me questions about watermelons in the fruit section. It was a casual conversation but he referred to my boyfriend as my brother and I quickly corrected him. The guy apologized said we looked similar and walked off, at the time my boyfriend just laughed it off. 

He then said something that pissed me off. He said ""sometimes I wish you were still big so no one else would want you."" I lost all sympathy and quickly corrected him. I told him even when I was a big girl guys hit on me all the time and just like I always do I told them I have a boyfriend that I love. He looked dumfounded. l told him how fucked it was that he wishes that I was back at the size where I was depressed and hated myself. He said he misspoke and I'm blowing things out of proportion. We argued more and he ended up leaving to his brothers to give me space.

I've been sitting here just pissing myself off about what he said. Did he really think I was that unattractive when I was bigger? If so why did he date me?

She also never left the country because my father thought traveling was a waste of money, and one day she told me how terrified she was whenever she saw me get on a plane (traveling is one of the things I value the most). In fact, a few months before my dad died, she told me that the greatest adventure of her life was the one time she took the Greyhound alone to visit her sister, when the bus stopped at a road station and she got out all by herself to grab a cup of coffee. That made me so sad.

Now, my aunt (the same sister she went to visit that time) is going on a cruise, and my mother told me she’d been invited to go along. I, of course, encouraged her to go: she has the time, she has the money, there’s nothing stopping her. But she immediately came up with a bunch of excuses not to go, so I insisted, and told her it’s about time she starts living.

She got very serious when I made this comment, though. She says that just because she made different choices, that doesn’t mean she’s wasted her life. I told her that’s what it seemed to me, and brought back that Greyhound story she’d told me. She says she was just sharing something with me, not asking to be judged.

In fact, a few months before my dad died, she told me that the greatest adventure of her life was the one time she took the Greyhound alone to visit her sister, when the bus stopped at a road station and she got out all by herself to grab a cup of coffee. That made me so sad.

Now, my aunt (the same sister she went to visit that time) is going on a cruise, and my mother told me she’d been invited to go along. I, of course, encouraged her to go: she has the time, she has the money, there’s nothing stopping her. But she immediately came up with a bunch of excuses not to go, so I insisted, and told her it’s about time she starts living.

She got very serious when I made this comment, though. She says that just because she made different choices, that doesn’t mean she’s wasted her life. I told her that’s what it seemed to me, and brought back that Greyhound story she’d told me. She says she was just sharing something with me, not asking to be judged. I feel I didn’t mean anything hurtful and was only looking out for her, but I wonder if could’ve been the asshole here.",1.0,1.0526325702667236,1,1

A couple of weeks ago, I borrowed a stunning dress from her for a special event. The dress was beautiful, and I felt amazing in it. After the event, I decided to keep the dress a bit longer, telling Mia that I was still figuring out if I needed it for another occasion.



I continued wearing the dress and received numerous compliments. I began to think that the dress looked even better on me than it did on Mia. It made me feel confident and stylish, and I didn’t want to part with it. When Mia asked about getting the dress back, I mentioned that I’d grown very attached to it and felt it suited me perfectly.



Instead of returning the dress, I offered to buy it from Mia. I explained that I thought it looked better on me and that I’d really like to keep it. Mia mentioned she had planned to wear it herself for an upcoming event.



I genuinely didn’t intend to cause any issues; I just really loved how the dress made me feel. Now I’m questioning if I’m being unreasonable for offering to buy my friend’s clothes because I believe they look better on me.

62,1firkyl,AITA for correcting my S/O while they were venting?,"Hi Reddit,

The situation was as follows, my S/O and I were playing a multiplayer video game. In one game, we lost, and one of our opponents went out of their way to harass my s/o because they felt that my s/o was pathetic for losing despite using what the opponent felt was an OP build. I said at the time that the opponent was an a-hole and an idiot for making such a comment, but my S/O is convinced that I made no such comment.

Right afterwards, my s/o commented, ""Why the heck did that a-hole come after me? I mean I did leak but anyone would have leaked against a 4000 send. "" I immediately corrected my s/o because they'd received way less than 4000 enemy units (more specifically, 3200ish). They then replied saying ""Ok but there is no real difference with 3500"", I then corrected them again saying that I had received 3580 and that they received \~3200. My s/o was getting angry and wanted to know why the specific number mattered given that they wouldn't have been able to defend against 2000 units. It was the final round of the game, and during this round its customary to send as many units at your enemy as possible in an effort to break the line. My s/o's direct opponent had started saving one round earlier than standard, making what would typically be \~2000 units instead be over 3200. It's worth noting that my S/O held out longer than anyone on our team.

I didn't want to post anything about this, but we had a long debate about why the numbers matter, and my S/O insisted that I post so I could finally get it through my head that how I said things mattered alot. 

I don't think I did anything wrong, as being accurate is very important to me. I also thought that correcting the errors should calm my s/o down. It didn't. My s/o got extremely mad at this point, to the extent of wanting to leave the house. 

AITA for being accurate?

","Wife has 6 siblings. She is 4^(th) child. She has 2 older brothers and one older sister, and then two younger brothers and 1 younger sister. We used to live in Connecticut but moved to Texas. Both of her parents are still alive, but in recent years have become very ill. My wife was their primary caretaker. When we moved, they were still in good health and both had jobs and lived well. When their health started to decline they went to live with her older sister for several years, but sister no longer wanted the responsibility, and they went to live with oldest brother. Older brother has a gambling problem. He also supports his daughter (College graduate, makes good money as an accountant and is in school for her masters or something or certification?). She has no college debt because basically my wife’s oldest brother paid for everything. Makes good money as accountant, but her father pays her rent, car payments, insurance, any adult bills you can think of. This caused my wife’s brother to become deep in debt, and they even were evicted. We didn’t want oldest brother, in-laws, three younger siblings to be homeless, we helped them with the money to rent a new place. Fast forward a few months, and it’s the same vicious cycle. Parents in law are getting social security, disability, and etc.

 Two of the younger siblings are actually getting paid by the government too because they have disabilities that makes it hard to work (but they do work!). All three younger siblings work in retail, fast food, etc. to help with bills. Rent became late on their new place. This should not be the case with 6 incomes going into it. Wife helped financially at times. She found out several months ago that oldest brother was taking money from parents disability, social, etc and all three younger siblings govt checks and paychecks and paying his daughter’s BILLS! My wife flew to Connecticut and told oldest brother to put a stop to this. When she came back she was distraught and we came up with a plan. We spoke to her older sister who agreed to have parents and younger siblings back with her if anything were to happen. Plans ended up changing and the two youngest siblings moved to Texas to live with wife and I. We didn’t mind, they are good kids. Youngest two siblings got a job, enrolled in school, and thriving in Texas with us. Oldest brother let rent get too late again, and they were evicted. In laws moved in with my wife’s older sister. Wife’s youngest sister couldn’t turn a blind eye to her oldest brother. She has an allowance, and her job. 

Youngest sister felt pity for her oldest brother and has been secretly sending him money. It’s fine, it’s her money to do what she wants with. We told her we would help her buy a cash car If she came up with half. She had half. She gave it to her older brother. She is heartbroken over it.

My heart broke for her and I almost caved and gave her the money for homecoming. I don’t want to reinforce her oldest brother’s bad habits. If we let this slide, he will see her as a meal ticket (if he doesn’t already).

Earlier this year my partner lost his mother due to a unfortunate accident. Since then he has been cold, distant and pretty disrespectful. He already had a drinking problem before the accident but after it has gotten beyond worse. I understand that losing a parent is like no other and the pain of that is torturing. 
I would also like to point out that I’m not dismissing his pain or hurt. 
I have been there for him as best I could, supporting him, being a shoulder to cry on, a listening ear, supported financially, as well as supporting his sibling. 
All i have gotten is constant disrespect, name calling, have been told to fuck off, told that he regrets being with me or starting a relationship with me, that i’m just like all other females, that all I do is lie. A few times while I’m working I have chopped multiple missed calls, if i don’t answer i get told im cheating and fucking someone else (I’m a chef and work 12-14 hour days, some days i can’t always answer my phone right away) 
Mind you all this disrespect happens when he drinks too much.
He has access to my phone whenever he wants i have nothing to hide. 
I have gone through his phone a few times and have seen a few messages that are unsettling to me, but not fully pushing the boundaries but is dancing on that line. He has a female friend (perfectly fine, i also have a male friend that he is also really good friends with, thats how we met) anyway, he has said a few things that are abit iffy to me and when i bring it up its brushed off or he ignores what im saying and changes the topic. In the messages he has mentioned that she is sexy, a nice looking girl, that he loves her, sent “xo” and has said he will try his best to be there for her in need. 
Mind you he is never there for me, if I’m having a hard time and just need a little support or reassurance i get told “i got my own shit going on, you should just know” or he when he notices im quiet or tired i get “oh your cranky, your bitchy” but not a simple “is everything okay?” Whenever i bring up his disrespect or behaviour i get thrown in my face “well my mum dead so fuck off” and then it’s all flipped onto me and im the one apologising for my reaction to his disrespect.
I don’t know what to do in this situation. I love him dearly so much and I know his potential. At the moment though i feel so unloved, unappreciated, not cared for, nor do i feel attracted to either.

67,1firfub,AITA for losing my shit over the potential cancelling of our months long planned road trip,"First of all, please don't mind the new account. My wife is a frequent reddit user and I don't want her linking this to me. AFAIK she is not in this subreddit, so I should be in the clear.

So, my wife and I have been planning to go on an over-a-week long road trip across many states for soooo many months. We've spent countless evenings budgeting, finding attractions, hotels, rental cars, etc. Now we are only a couple of weeks away from packing our stuff and hitting the road. Then all of a sudden\* her little brother (early 20s) decides he wants to come visit us because his girlfriend has returned from her home country after being away for a while. Normally, I would be ecstatic about him visiting since I DO like him and we do love playing video games together. But he's a such an idiot who spent over $800 on plane tickets WITHOUT telling us that he intends to visit. And wouldn't you know it, he would arrive smack dab in the middle of our planned trip.

After speaking with him on the phone, my wife wants to discuss whether or not we should postpone our trip to accommodate him and his girlfriend (who she hates BTW) or at least shorten it. I was having none of it. We are in our mid-to-late 20s and I was telling her it could be our last chance to just go somewhere without kids and other life stuff dragging us down. After about half an hour of me losing my shit, she agreed that we would go on trip and if they still want to come, they could have the house/car to themselves and entertain each other. 

Even though I got what I wanted from the argument, I feel pretty shitty about what happened and left wondering if there was a more civil way to handle the situation. 

\*\*\* That little asterisk is there since my wife and I DID know he wanted to come visit us once his girlfriend arrives but just expected him much earlier than our trip.\*\*\*

Then all of a sudden\* her little brother (early 20s) decides he wants to come visit us because his girlfriend has returned from her home country after being away for a while. Normally, I would be ecstatic about him visiting since I DO like him and we do love playing video games together. But he's a such an idiot who spent over $800 on plane tickets WITHOUT telling us that he intends to visit. And wouldn't you know it, he would arrive smack dab in the middle of our planned trip.

After speaking with him on the phone, my wife wants to discuss whether or not we should postpone our trip to accommodate him and his girlfriend (who she hates BTW) or at least shorten it. I was having none of it. We are in our mid-to-late 20s and I was telling her it could be our last chance to just go somewhere without kids and other life stuff dragging us down. After about half an hour of me losing my shit, she agreed that we would go on trip and if they still want to come, they could have the house/car to themselves and entertain each other. 

Even though I got what I wanted from the argument, I feel pretty shitty about what happened and left wondering if there was a more civil way to handle the situation. 

\*\*\* That little asterisk is there since my wife and I DID know he wanted to come visit us once his girlfriend arrives but just expected him much earlier than our trip.\*\*\*

Also I'm sorry about the broken English. None of us are a native speaker. Please let me know if anything doesn't make sense.",0.0,1.0080626010894775,1,0
68,1firelj,AITA for telling my sister she can't keep her dress in my closet anymore? ,"AITA for not storing my sister's dress in my closet anymore? 

I (25F) have moved back into my parents' house after living a couple hours away for about 3 years. My sister (22F) has always lived in our parents' house, except for a 2.5-month period this past summer when she temporarily moved out for an internship opportunity. 

I have 3 years of stuff I'm trying to organize and store between my room and a storage unit about 15 minutes away from the house. I am paying for the storage unit, as well as all of my living expenses, except for rent - our parents don't charge us rent as long as we help with things chores around the house.

My sister has been storing a rather large formal gown (zipped up in a garment bag, but still pretty poofy) in my closet (standard size for US bedrooms) since she bought it & wore it for a high school dance. I volunteered that she could keep it in my closet before I moved out, but now that I'm back in my room I want to use every little bit of space I have inside my room.

My sister's closet, on the other hand, is a small walk-in closet. There is a rail for hanging clothes, but it's only tall enough to hand shorts/tops and then it becomes shelves for the bottom half. She has another garment rack to keep long dresses on. Her entire closet is packed to bursting. She says that due to the length of the dress, my closet is the only place in the house with sufficient height clearance to store this dress.

I know it's kinda petty to not give up a tiny bit of my own closet space to store one single dress, but it's also *my* closet space and I think she should find her own solution (especially since I'm finding my own solution for all of my stuff I can't fit in my room instead of of trying to cram it in the shared spaces around the house). I have a couple old formal dresses in my closet as well, but they don't fit anymore so I am getting rid of them.

TL;DR - I let my sister keep a long & poofy formal dress in my closet before I moved out of our parents' house, and now that I'm moving back in I don't want to store her dress in my closet anymore, especially because I'm getting rid of my own old formal dresses.

69,1fir88x,AITA for Expecting More from My BIL Living with Us?,"My Brother in Law has been living with us since March 2022. Initially, we didn’t expect him to contribute financially because he was paying for his international Master’s degree (around $100,000 AUD). In exchange, he helped out with childcare once a week by taking our toddler out for a few hours (I’d still handle feeding and changing when they got back). He also has full use of one of our cars without paying for running costs.

After he finished paying for his degree, we agreed he would start contributing $250 per week to cover rent, bills, food, etc. (for context, an unfurnished room in a share house in our area rents for $250 without bills or food). We also cook dinner for him most nights. However, he hasn’t actually started paying yet. He keeps delaying it, coming up with excuses. He’s also complained that the $250 is too high and constantly grumbles about having to vacuum (even though I have to remind him several times to do it, and he often forgets).

On top of that, we’ve covered around $10k of his personal expenses that we expect to be paid back. He hasn’t made any effort to pay that either. 

Personality-wise, he’s a good person at heart, but very self-centered. He rarely considers others when making decisions, has narcissistic traits, and often lies or treats our house like a hotel. He’s also messy and difficult to live with. 

Despite these frustrations, we do appreciate the help he gives with our toddler—they have a sweet, sibling-like bond, and he usually plays with them for about 2 hours at night (though not every night). He also picks up the groceries I order (which I’ve already paid for). We’re happy with his contributions overall and are fine with him continuing to live with us, but I don’t want to have to keep asking for help repeatedly.

AITA for thinking that his financial contribution is fair and for wanting him to follow through on the agreement? Or should I be handling this differently?

70,1fir77c,AITA for yelling at my uncle and refusing to apologizing to this day?,"I (16F) yelled at my uncle (37M) a few months ago.

My uncle is an immature adult and he always have been. He complains about being lost in this world and not know anything about anything. I'll admit, he grew up with parents who were not so cultured or know how the world works and that might've messed him up but so did my mother and my other uncle. He never failed to remind his parents (my grandparents) of their terrible jobs raising him and how he's fucked up and a lost cause because of it. Since my grandpa passed away the heat was now all on my grandma. I won't get into the nitty gritty details but after a messy divorce, he ended up living with his mom again and the complaints grew more frequent. How she set him up for failure, how she never supported him, how he was never guided to the right path, etc, etc. The complaints were valid at first but it slowly turned into ""I'm right. You're wrong"" mentality where he won't accept any push back towards him. It started to annoy the hell out of me. I'm a very non confrontational person and usually keep my thoughts to myself. I have never talked back to adults or family members for that matter until now.

We (me, my mom and him) finished up work and were walking around the city. They got into a conversation that turned into him complaining that my grandma doesn't contact her friends and how she's a horrible friend for not reaching out once a week (I wish I was kidding). My mom fought back by telling him that he was worse for not even calling or texting his own sister(her) while she was at her all time low which got him on rambling on how he's the best and how everyone was after him.

I snapped. Yelling at him to shut up which got him even more defensive saying how my mom started it first. I told him off saying that he started by attacking his own mother and my mom just pointed out HIS own mistakes calling him out. Something happened that made him pissed and my mom told me to apologize which I did half-assly. We had an awkward ride home and I haven't talked to him since. My grandma called me a few days later scolding me for talking back and told me to apologize to him again. He complained to her about my behavior while conviently forgetting to mention his own faults.

71,1fir052,AITA? My son sprayed water on our tv while I was out of the room putting my oldest 3 kids to bed and now the tv won’t turn on. ,"My (30) son (3) is autistic, and gets into things fairly frequently and quickly. I was putting my oldest 3 children to bed in another room, and my son was in the room with a spray bottle spraying the corner of the tv with water, without my knowledge. When I came back into the room I saw what he was doing, and quickly took the spray bottle away and told him no, and that’s not appropriate behavior. His dad (39) had left to go get a vape without letting me know, so I assumed he was here and supervising our son while I put my oldest kids to bed, and when I saw he wasn’t I of course took action myself. After a while I had sat down to watch tv, and my bf walked back in the room, pretty much at the same time I had sat down. I realized the tv wasn’t turning on, and told him “the tv isn’t turning on, I think it’s because (or son) was spraying the tv with a spray bottle of water in the bottom corner a little bit ago”. Frustrated, my bf then says “so you watched him spray the tv, and didn’t stop him?” I then told him no, of course I stopped him, but I don’t know how long he was spraying the tv because I was putting the other kids to bed”. He then made a comment about how my older 3 kids always need help and can’t be “independent” for shit, and how I should have been here to watch our son. I then mentioned that I had thought he was here, because he had left to get a vape and didn’t tell me anything. He responded to that with “you should have called me if your kids needed help that badly getting to bed that you had to leave the room”. Now my bf is pissed the tv is broken and blames me for it, and isn’t speaking to me, and is furious with our son. I don’t understand what I did wrong, I feel like it’s a normal thing to say goodnight to your children, it’s not really a “need”, it’s more of a nurturing thing, my oldest kids are also not old enough (they’re 10,9,and 6) to do everything on their own, so it’s natural that they need me as I am their mother.. I also don’t know why I should’ve assumed that he had left somewhere, because I was upstairs and had no idea since I couldn’t hear the front door open and shut. I also did take the spray bottle away as soon as I saw my son spraying the tv, so I feel like I acted appropriately. My bf also made a comment on how I didn’t bother to wipe the tv down, because when he came into the room he saw me “sitting on the bed letting the tv marinate”, when i did wipe the tv down, I had just left a couple streaks apparently.

At one point she asked him what his favorite animal was, he responded with “it’s a bird but you have to guess” after a series of questions he got flustered and said “it can walk around but it can also fly”.

Ever since then my mom has asked me to borrow money every now and again for cigarettes and she would always pay me back fairly quickly. When I got my first summer job My mom started asking to borrow money more often and would take longer to pay me back. You know $20 here. $40 here would take about a month until I would see the money again, a couple times she would borrow a hundred and take a long time to pay me back. And I always give it to her because I feel bad and she's done a lot for me my whole life.

76,1fiqb98,AITAH For wanting my fiancé to prioritize my family’s vacation over her best friends trip,"My fiancé (let’s call her Sally) and I are getting married next month. Since we’ve been together, we’ve had fights about how to prioritize family time. We live on the same coast as her family and my family lives on the opposite coast, so through no fault of hers, we see her family significantly more.

My sister recently was diagnosed with MS. Sucks. So far, she has light symptoms but it’s a disease that can progress quickly (or can not). My family has adopted a very “let’s make every moment count” mentality, because we don’t know how many years we have with my sister in good health.

My brother reached out to me to say they are planning a trip on the week that both his kids and my sisters kids have spring break. This would be a week long trip. It has a fixed date because of the kids schedule.

When I told Sally, she mentioned that her best friend had reached out to start planning a girls trip. Sally lives a several hour drive from that group of girls and almost always misses this girls trip. Her friend let her know that she’s reaching out early to make sure that Sally can go. She told me she “just wants to get ahead of this” and doesn’t want to let her friend down. They don’t know when it would be, but it may be the same date as my family’s trip. No one in that group (including us) have kids, so we have much more flexibility.

I’ll be honest that I got frustrated very quickly and was not very comforting or understanding. I tried to resist bringing up my sister having MS, but eventually I did and said that’s why we’re pushing so hard to take advantage of these years. Sally responded that we “don’t know that things will be bad and we need to stay positive.” That rubbed me the wrong way because I feel like she’s missing how awful we would feel if the MS did progress quickly.

Sally told me that I’m being manipulative and controlling for pressuring her to plan her friends trip around my family’s trip. I believe it’s fair to expect your spouse to show up for things like that and to prioritize family (especially family you don’t see) over friends. Particularly with the illness situation.

Here’s where I could be the asshole: I definitely reacted poorly when she treated the trips as two equally important things. I absolutely pressured her to agree to go on the family trip. I also brought up previous fights (like about beginning to split Christmases) to point out that she’s been resistant to sacrificing time with her people to get an equal amount of time with my people.

Also: I’m sure some folks are wondering why I don’t go alone. My family adores Sally and want her to be part of the family. I want her to be part of my family just like I want to be part of her family. It’s not realistic that we do every single thing together, but I think we should both make a significant effort to.

**Update:**

Thank you all for your advise and input. When I left the original post, I was not in a great headspace. I also tried to keep it concise so there's plenty of context missed. This will be the last I update or respond, and I'll break the update into additional context and the resolution.

**Additional Context:**

1. Sally adores my family as well. She has always told me how much they mean to her, and has even floated the idea of potentially moving to my home state and how we would be able to see my parents and my sister more. We haven't made any decisions and leaving her home state would be very difficult for her. It's impossible to summarize everything she's done to show she cares about my family over the last 7 years, but I know beyond the shadow of a doubt that she does.

2. She's never gone on this trip she's invited to because she is not close with the majority of the people on the trip. Her best friend reached out to her early because she really wants Sally to become closer friends with this group.

3. The scenario that lead to us knowing about my sister's diagnosis was crappy. We found out by my mom accidentally telling me that my sister was getting tests done. We were sworn to secrecy because my sister was adamant that she didn't want to distract us from the wedding until she had the final diagnosis. It was an honest mistake from my mom, but it's been an emotionally charged situation for both Sally and me. We're both grieving.

  
4. For a variety of reasons, we have been completely overwhelmed by this wedding. There's been a lot of drama coming from outside sources and it's been exhausting to the point where we wish we had just eloped. No, it's not my family. 

5. Sally has unlimited PTO and we have enough funds to do both trips.

6. I don't know everything about MS. My understanding is that it's absolutely possible it has a minimal impact on my sister for the next few decades, but it could also be a debilitating situation.

7. My family were all together (without me) in Italy two weekends ago. We will all be together over the wedding in a few weeks. This trip will not be a loaded, heavy, ""saying goodbye"" trip at all. It's just something we want to prioritize because the future is uncertain.

  
**Resolution:**

  
We had a great conversation about it this morning. We acknowledged that we're both overwhelmed with this diagnosis and we're both overwhelmed with wedding planning, to the point where it's really difficult to wrap our heads around what comes next. We came into that conversation in an unhealthy headspace and both said things that weren't ideal.

She wants to go on the trip. She has been feeling protective about committing to things in the next year because of how underwater she is with the wedding, but on reflection, realized how important this is to her.

Sally also let me know that she's still adjusting to having family that has kids and how inflexible their schedules are. Her siblings don't have kids, so their vacations are a lot more flexible.

We're going to sit down when we're less overwhelmed and talk about what our goals for how often we see each side of the family are, how we can make that happen, and how we'll handle situations like that in the future.

No matter how much weight I lose, the mass under my tissue still makes it look like I have breasts, and nothing seems to help.

So tonight I told him that I will be throwing them away if he leaves them out. 

I told him I’m tired of cleaning up after him and the children’s safety is important to me, and when he asked why I would throw them away I said maybe he’d be motivated to check after himself more. 

He says I’m penalizing him for mistakes, I’m still cleaning up after him so what difference does it make for me to just set them aside instead (as I’ve been doing), I don’t have the right to throw away his shit, I’d be wasting money, and I’m acting like a fucking child. And that I also leave dangerous substances around (his examples were cheese stick wrappers and the bottle of Lysol on the kitchen counter) and that he’s always cleaning up after me but he doesn’t say anything about it. 

I may be the ah for threatening to throw the pouches away instead of continuing to set them aside and talking about it again.

Many of us were not to keen on this idea as we didn’t want the games to take precedent over the hanging out aspect, we just wanted to do the holiday classic style again.

An argument ensues, and eventually we agree to let him take the reins this year moreso so we can stop arguing. Anyway George writes up a document in what he wants to do, and then starts pawning work off onto everybody in the group for the “new” board game. Anyway nobody wanted to do this work for him.

He says that we should all help with this holiday, but I said we owe him nothing as it was his idea and we didn’t even want to do it this way in the first place it was practically forced on us.

I(31f) am the oldest of 7 with ages ranging from 18-31. 6 of us have partners/married. 4 of us have a combined 13 children aging between 2 months and 12 years. Our father is still alive but our mother passed away a year ago. We are a pretty traditional family in which women stay home to tend to the home and men go out to work. While we have a family ranch where most of us live on the property and we all pitch in. We also have a weekly family dinner at dads house.

I’ve had some issues with them as far as them not liking the way we are raising our kids and saying that it’s their rules at their house, etc so we have been not very open to the kids being at their house a ton. 

Now onto the ballet thing. Ever since I was pregnant with my daughter, I dreamed of taking her to the Nutcracker ballet when she was old enough to appreciate it.

My family was on vacation at the time so I chose to just ignore the text  and figured I would deal with it later.

Because of the pandemic, we got married in late 2021, and we did not have any sort of party unless you count having her mother and my sister over for drinks after. Because of various factors, mostly economic, we haven't had an actual ceremony and party with friends and family. However, after spending an absurdly long time planning it, figuring out the money situation, we are set to have our wedding ceremony and party literally next Saturday. 

However, my dad died yesterday. I should probably be trying to deal with that outside of Reddit, but my family's been stressing me out so that's why I'm here. I'll try to keep this short, but my relationship with my parents has always been complicated. I moved out as a teenager to live with my oldest sister and I hadn't talked to my dad since then, I had only talked to my mom sporadically. They were invited to the wedding as an olive branch more than anything, but they hadn't confirmed they were going and I wasn't exactly expecting them to. That being said, my mother has been asking me to move the date of my wedding since it's ""distasteful"" to ""have a party"" so soon after, and also because she wants to hold the funeral the exact same day.

93,1fin0an,AITA for criticising my friend for acting like a child ,"My friend (F21) and I (F21) have been close friends since we were 16. I have gotten annoyed with her in the past, but the benefits of her friendship and the good parts of her personality have always outweighed these quirks. She is my only good friend from home that I keep in touch with.  

We have gone away together for a 3 day trip, for the first time. I have found that I am constantly having to be put in this ‘parental’ role because she acts like a child. I have tried to set boundaries but I feel I am constantly criticising her. These are some examples of her behaviour:

1) she can be very negative and trauma dumps about her mental problems. She is not currently in therapy. She will complain excessively about her job, university, friends, family. I often ignore her when she does this and she never gets the hint. 

2) when she isn’t complaining she is ecstatically happy about things. She will run around my house picking up random things like an overexcited child and proclaim it’s the best thing ever. Like a random pair of oven gloves or my body spray. Something is either the worst thing or the best thing in the world. 

3) an argument with her boyfriend will send her into a manic episode and she will complain to me about it, telling me the awful things he’s done, then a week later will proclaim that he’s the best person in the whole world and she wants to marry him and that they’re moving in together after university. Then will be annoyed when I don’t act excited for her. I have told her that I don’t want to hear about her boyfriend problems anymore because he treats her badly and has cheated in the past, but she will never help herself no matter the advice I give her. 

4) this trip has made me realise how poor her social awareness is. She will babble on about random topics of conversation that I am not interested in without realising I am not interested. She talk on and on, switching between the most random topics with no cohesion. She will interrupt me when I talk, and if she asks me a question she will answer it before I can reply. She will show me her infected toenail whilst I am eating and will keep talking about it even when I’ve told her not to. I have told her that a conversation is supposed to be 2 ways and sometimes it’s ok to have a comfortable silence if you’re spending a lot of time with a person, but it doesn’t change. 

5) she speaks with a baby voice and with a lisp when she feels vulnerable or wants to try act ‘cutesey.’

6) on my birthday a few weeks before the trip, she was supposed to get a drink with me after work to celebrate, but an hour before texted me to complain about the ‘bad day’ she’s had and that she wanted to move the plans earlier. She also wouldn’t understand why I found this negativity annoying on my birthday. 

I don’t want to lose this friend but I can’t be bothered to put in my energy into dealing with this childlike behaviour.

94,1fimvft,AITA for withholding rent until my flatmate returns the money he owes me?,"Me (19F) and my flatmate (20M) moved into a flat 4 months ago. I had savings from living with my parents and working full time. He did not have sufficient savings to pay 2 weeks advance and bond, so I ended up paying the entirety of the bond for the flat. 

We had a falling out in which I made a mistake that hurt him, and he lost trust in me as a friend. I was desperate to regain his friendship and he was reassuring that he would be able to forgive me in time, so we decided to keep living together. 

After this falling out, he asked me to do a lot of things in order to regain his trust and allow him to be more comfortable. I had just moved back to our hometown, so I didn't now many people and was getting to know his friends and social circle. We also worked together. After our falling out, he asked me to quit my job, to stop being friends or friendly with the people he knows, to stop going to events that he will be at, and, most recently, he asked me to move out. I should note that these were not demands, but rather he said that he was uncomfortable having me in these situations with him and said that, if I were a good friend to him, I would remove myself so as to make him more comfortable.

He said by proving myself to be a good friend to him, he would begin to trust me again and we could continue our friendship. As this went on, I  started to resent him for making me abandon my life and became aware that our friendship would never be the same. I agreed to move out so as to distance myself completely from that part of my life, but I made it clear that I expected him to pay me back for his bond before I moved out.

I have since moved out, although I am liable to pay for rent until they find someone new. When he contacted me about other things after I left, I reminded him about the money he owes me. He was unconcerned and blasé about it, telling me I'd get it as some point. I insisted that he give me a timeline or something before the new tenant came in. When he continued to be unconcerned, I threatened to not pay rent until he paid me back.

This is where I think I might be the asshole. I know he doesn't have the money to pay me back or the pay for my portion of the rent. He's not too good at saving and I know that he forgot about the money he owed me until I reminded him a couple days ago. On top of that, he doesn't make very good money. He has said that to pay me back in the next couple weeks he will not be able to eat, and to pay for my portion of the bond, both he and our other flatmate will have to borrow money from their parents.

95,1fimoqe,AITA for shouting at my roommate for changing my toothpaste,"Hi everyone I have moved to a new place recently like 1 and half month now. I am sharing my place with 3 others and so far there hasn't been a complain with anyone.

Today as usual I woke up and went to brush my teeth. The toothpaste was  bitter and tasted weird . I again washed my brush, garged and put it in my mouth to brush it was still bitter to taste and worst. I check the tube and it was mentioned minty flavor. And that it when it clicked me I did not use any flavor in my paste . I searched my bathroom and couldn't find anything else . It was morning and I woke my roommate up asking if she had switched something. Her responses were no and she said someone from out May have come here .

I freshen up without brushing and then she had a whole dispute on how I reacted with her . I also said if she was in a same situation she would have reacted in a same way . I also checked with other roommates bathroom if they had someway taken it but nothing

Cut to evening when I went to get a toothpaste I wasn't able to find anything plain without any flavor . Even the cavity one I got it seems had mint flavor. Here I think I may be an asshole, after seeing the cover seems no different than the packaging I had before. And I think it the same tube which I overreacted and I am the wrong person.

But it doesn't explain me why the toothpaste was tasting weird. Did someone really tampered with my toothpaste or brush or am I the problem?

ps: I have a habit of questioning myself as I had beening through emotional trauma before. I am out of that 2 years now and I do stand for myself if I feel something is wrong. But I want to know if this is my delusion from questioning habit or something I needed to do .

Edit : to be clear the toothpaste stated it's a mint flavor but it was tasting bitter. NOT different . Bitter.

My update was not approved yesterday as it was just 5 hours but here it is

Also  the taste  part it was bitter. begin non English speaker I got messed up with two taste .

bitter melon is bitter and lemon is sour. it was bitter.

edit :

Hi , Even you guys said I am AH. I am okay for that and I will address such situations in a better way.

Regarding trauma I think most of them have considered that I am saying as an excuse for shouting. I did not mean that. I was referring to the part were I went to shop for toothpaste and saw a mint favored package . It was similar to one I use but in mint. Which I got into dilemma that maybe this was mine and I am blaming others . I was remorseful for that . Being gaslighted by other for most of my growing up phase and beening a people pleaser it takes some courage to differentiate what is right or wrong (just in normal life ) and put me into a thinking loop if the paste was never switched.

After all the comments I finally decided to Check my bin. The paste color was the green-blue and not something I have use. Mine is always the plain white one . So definitely I am not a delusional or anything stated by anyone. Also the color is not due to any bacterial growth. The tube belongs to someone else .

I am thankful for other who were kind to me and trying understand the problem.

96,1fimm9j,AITA for telling my friend that their roommate makes me uncomfortable?,"I (32F) am currently living away from home while I finish my doctoral program. I've been feeling lonely and homesick, so I made plans to fly back to visit some friends for a week. Due to everyone's schedules and living situations, only Anna (38F) had a room available for me. The flight was expensive, so I was grateful for a free place to stay.

When we initially made these plans, Anna was living with our friend Caleb (32M). Caleb ended up moving out a few months ago and his friend, John (34M), moved into his old room. Apparently, Anna and John have become close friends and have been hanging out a lot ever since.

Before anyone says anything, no, their relationship is not romantic at all. Anna is a lesbian and even planned on introducing me to her new girlfriend, Erin (27F), when I visited. 

While I'm happy Anna gets along so well with John, I'm not a huge fan of him. I've spent time with him at events over the years, and he always ends up saying something rude or condescending to me.

For example, one time, we went out to play putt-putt. While I love golf--I played competitively in high school and even got a scholarship for it--I'm \*terrible\* at putt-putt. But it's just a game, and it's something my friends enjoy, so I was happy to go and spend time with them. What I wasn't happy about was John mocking me for doing poorly. He said something like, ""I can't believe you got a scholarship for golf because if this is how you play, \[school\] should have demanded a refund!"" He laughed it off, but I could tell he was serious.

I'd never talked to Anna about not liking John before. Since I didn't see him often and not everyone gets along with everyone, it never felt right to bring it up. But now that they're spending a lot of time together (to the point I fully expected her to want to include him in ALL of our plans), I decided to talk to her about my concerns.

I told her I didn't feel comfortable being around John. I didn't want to outright exclude him, but I did want to come up with things we could do together, just the two of us, so I could have breaks from him.

Anna didn't take it well. She got defensive and said my examples were just John's sense of humor and he's like that with everyone. That was when she told me I'm now the third (!) person to say something to her about him.

I tried to explain my feelings and made it clear that I just wanted to be able to get some space from John if (when) his comments crossed a line.

That's when Anna told me I was no longer welcome to stay at her house if I couldn't get along with John. She said it wasn't fair to him to have someone in their home who didn't like him and that I needed to be more understanding.

Now I'm wondering if I'm the AH for bringing up my feelings about John at all.

98,1fim8ki,AITA For Screaming at My Mom and Calling Her F-ucking Insane?,"So I (16f) and my mom (58f) have been going through this cycle for many years now where we have good months and then bad days. Today was a bad day. For context, I am Chinese and my mother is also Chinese. Now, I don't like stereotypes but I have to admit that my mother is a stereotypical Chinese parent. She is boarderline narcissistic, nationalist, and has all the qualities of a movie scene Chinese mother. To get to the story, I must preface this with I am not proud of screaming at my mother. It was not something that I made with a clear mind but it gets so frustrating and hard to communicate with her. She is constantly belittling me, not listening, or choosing to pick and choose what she hears. When I say I screamed at her, I mean that I SCREAMED at her. With all my lungs and all my power. I just could not deal with it. I screamed this ""Do you realize how fxcking insane you are? I'm tired of your bullshit."" Now for the story, I have recently gotten my learners permit and have started to drive with my dad. He is slowly teaching me how to drive his car, this week he is out of the state and I cannot practice with him. However, he told me and my mother that I needed to get at least some practice in while he was away, as to not lose the muscle memory I have been building. She had initially agreed and we had said that she would pick me up from school and I would drive home. There are two ways to get home, the highway or what we call “country roads” or “backroads.” I have not yet driven on the highway so I told her I would drive on the country roads home, as it is generally easier than a busy highway. When she came to pick me up, I asked if I was driving and she answered with “It busy, you no drive today. Practice more. You not ready yet.” I was already getting frustrated at this point. It had been a long day and we had talked earlier that morning and had agreed that I would be driving home. I was slightly confused on her wording, how could our mainly empty country roads be busy? But I didn’t fight it, chalking it up to her English not being that good. So I get in the car and we pull out of the parking lot. The second we get onto the main road and start heading home, she starts talking of how I am not ready to be driving and that my father is wrong for the way he is teaching me to drive. Now, granted, I am bias towards my father. He is generally more pleasant to be around and actually listens when I speak of issues that concern me. His way of teaching me was to take me to a golf course and drive the gold cart, then drive in a parking lot, then drive in a empty neighborhood, then on a pretty empty road, then the next time we drove through a more busy city area. Next he had planned to take me on the highway but I got scared and he told me I could wait till next time. So, in my mind, his way of teaching me is not bad. He has taken his time to “level” me up from the different difficulties. So when my mom said this, I was already getting more angry. She often uses me as a therapist to tell me all of her woes with my dad. What he did wrong, what he needs to change, how he raised his daughter wrong (my step-step-sister, important for later). In addition to that, she also criticized the way I asked my male friend out to a restaurant that I would be meeting him for later that day. She is very traditionalist in the thought that women don’t ask men out, even though I have no romantic interest in him  and he doesn’t have any in me. So when I got home, I was already very frustrated with her. She is fine to be around but sometimes she is just so frustrating and irritating. The whole twenty minute drive home was fully of her saying “you’re not good enough to drive on the highway” when I had already told her that morning I wasn’t going on the highway and “he will get the wrong impression of you asking him to go, you will scare him away” when I had told her MILLIONS of times I don’t like him like that. So when we got home, she was still talking about how my dad is wrong for teaching me to drive and I am not ready (her words not mine.) I understand her concern but I am going off to college next fall (fall of 2025) and soon enough I will need to know how to drive to get my license. When we came in our house, she was still talking on and on about how my dad was wrong for teaching me and that his ways are wrong. The whole time I was taking my shoes off and unpacking she was still going on about how my father was wrong. wrong. wrong. As I was going to wash my face, this is what made me scream at her. She said “He (my dad) taught ****** (my step-step-sister) too soon that’s why she is bad and useless”  And I snapped. I screamed at her ""Do you realize how fxcking insane you are? I'm tired of your bullshit."" I’m not proud of it but I just had so much pent up frustration from not being heard, to anger from having to hear my mom shit on my dad (for lack of better words). My step-step-sister, let’s call her Amy, is a drug addict who crashed 3 cars when she was 16-21. So my mother isn’t wrong for saying what she did but that doesn’t mean she had any reason to say it. My mom is constantly coming after Amy, even when Amy is in rehab and trying her hardest to get better. I don’t think it is my mom’s place to say ANYTHING about how my dad and Amy’s mother raised her. Granted, Amy was raised in a divorced household which was probably one of the reasons why she turned to substances. I feel like i’m rambling now but I just can’t deal with her anymore. I’m counting down the days till I leave for college and have space between us. It’s not like my mother is terrible all the time. Often we get along well and I like to be with her but the bad times make it bad. It started when I was in 6th grade but that is a whole other story of our issues. I’ve gotten off topic but after I screamed at her she just yelled that “I’m just saying this because I care, you know he (my dad) might not” or something similar. I was seething with anger and slammed my door and went to wash my face. I’m quick to calm down but I never forget how she makes me feel. After I went to go and have dinner with my friend and she picked me up. She started with her whole script again and I just couldn’t. I tuned her out the best I could and said nothing the whole way home. As I was getting out of the car she said that I need to say sorry to her. I said I was sorry for yelling but I wasn’t sorry for telling her how she is making me feel and how she is acting. Then we went inside and I went to my room to change for bed. I went to say goodnight and she asked me again to say I was sorry and that “you’re the one who needs to say sorry, I don’t. You’re very disrespectful.” I told her that I was not sure that I had it in me to say sorry and just “repeat this cycle” again. She got mad at me and yelled at me that I am the one who needs to say sorry and that I am in the wrong. I once again said that I would say sorry for yelling but not for anything else. Then I walked away without saying sorry at all. I hate that she thinks it’s appropriate to shit talk my dad in front of me, I hate that she uses me as her therapist for everything in her life, I hate that she doesn’t have any friends but acts like she’s above everyone who tries to befriend her. I hate that when I talk to her, be it English or Chinese, I know she will never fully heart or listen to me. I hate that I just feel so frustrated and tired of dealing with her. I’ve tried so hard to communicate in any way that she might understand me, writing letters in english, letters in chinese, speaking in slow simple english, speaking in chinese. Everything and yet she doesn’t hear me.  This has been a problem for years now. I’m talking since I was 12 or 13. We have screaming matches maybe 4 times a year and frankly I’m getting too old to have to deal with her immaturity and narcissism. I would love to hear any advice from people who have similar parents or are from asian parents. How do you communicate when you have been trying for years and it never works, am I in the wrong here? I don’t want to go NC with her because she is my mother and I feel bad for her but I just cannot deal with her forever and next time it might not be just screaming. I might physically do something that I don’t want to because I’m just. so. fucking. frustrated. I can’t do this anymore and I’m so tired of feeling like the bad guy when all I want is a mother who will listen to me and try to hear my words and how I am feeling. ",TL;DR,2024-09-17,"AITA For Screaming at My Mom and Calling Her F-ucking Insane? So I (16f) and my mom (58f) have been going through this cycle for many years now where we have good months and then bad days. Today was a bad day. For context, I am Chinese and my mother is also Chinese. Now, I don't like stereotypes but I have to admit that my mother is a stereotypical Chinese parent. She is boarderline narcissistic, nationalist, and has all the qualities of a movie scene Chinese mother. To get to the story, I must preface this with I am not proud of screaming at my mother. It was not something that I made with a clear mind but it gets so frustrating and hard to communicate with her. She is constantly belittling me, not listening, or choosing to pick and choose what she hears. When I say I screamed at her, I mean that I SCREAMED at her. With all my lungs and all my power. I just could not deal with it. I screamed this ""Do you realize how fxcking insane you are? I'm tired of your bullshit."" Now for the story, I have recently gotten my learners permit and have started to drive with my dad. He is slowly teaching me how to drive his car, this week he is out of the state and I cannot practice with him. However, he told me and my mother that I needed to get at least some practice in while he was away, as to not lose the muscle memory I have been building. She had initially agreed and we had said that she would pick me up from school and I would drive home. There are two ways to get home, the highway or what we call “country roads” or “backroads.” I have not yet driven on the highway so I told her I would drive on the country roads home, as it is generally easier than a busy highway. When she came to pick me up, I asked if I was driving and she answered with “It busy, you no drive today. Practice more. You not ready yet.” I was already getting frustrated at this point. It had been a long day and we had talked earlier that morning and had agreed that I would be driving home. I was slightly confused on her wording, how could our mainly empty country roads be busy? But I didn’t fight it, chalking it up to her English not being that good. So I get in the car and we pull out of the parking lot. The second we get onto the main road and start heading home, she starts talking of how I am not ready to be driving and that my father is wrong for the way he is teaching me to drive. Now, granted, I am bias towards my father. He is generally more pleasant to be around and actually listens when I speak of issues that concern me.

100,1fil36d,AITA for telling sister to quit theatre?,"
I’m currently a college sophomore (F19) and my sister is a high school senior (F17). 

I think I’m very protective of my younger sister and I’ve honestly never really liked the theatre group she was in our highschool. Many of my friends who were in my the school’s theatre told me that the director was cruel to any that wasn’t her favorite and that the same people would often get lead roles. Also some of my friends would complained about feeling racially stereotyped into roles.

As someone who is black it always bothered me how in my four years at that school, a POC was NEVER given a main role. It was a predominately white school but there were still poc (like my sister) but they were always ensemble. 

There was also a lot of nepotism that I was told about. She would take students that were ALREADY in college and put them into her high school plays. I have no idea how this was allowed but it happened a few times at my school. And of course if you were related to her favorites, you would also get big roles. 

Now my sister is very dedicated to theater. She puts in a lot of work each week and although a lot of people tell me the director is very strict, she tells me that she really likes the director. However every year she gets more and more demoralized because she ends up in ensemble. She’s had a smaller role with each continuing role and this year she tells me that this is her smallest role yet. 

But she’s still expected to stay after school and watch other performers for hours even when her role is so small. Now I know, I know very little about theater and the importance of ensemble, but it puts a sour taste in my mouth that the director would rather pull people from college than people from the actual high-school. Also the fact that most poc actors are shoved into the background makes me question the integrity of the director. 

It’s also annoying because people given lead roles are kind of mediocre imo. One lead from one of the plays I went to forgot her entire monologue and just started repeating things and looking around scared. So, I feel like if my sister was given the opportunity she could be just as good and grow a lot as a performer.

After my sister told me that she was once again put in ensemble, I told her that she should just quit theater if she wants any kind of bigger role because it’s not gonna happen at this school. I suggested for her to try a different club or even try community theater but she was so upset that I told her this and felt as though I wanted her to just give up.

I honestly feel bad, I know she genuinely enjoys performing in that theater and I’m thinking of apologizing and telling her to keep auditioning for better parts. But I also feel like they are wasting her time and taking her for granted as an actress. AITA?

101,1fiknj2,AITA For making my daughter pay for her own college testing and applications because she was caught cheating?,"I received a call to pick up my daughter ‘Lily’ because she had been caught cheating on her practice SAT. After arriving, I learned Lily’s friend ‘Sam’ had also been caught cheating. Her score was canceled, but, thankfully, Lily will still be allowed to retake the test and this has not gone under any kind of record.

When I talked to Lily about what happened, she told me that Sam’s mother was going to punish Sam if she didn’t earn an exceptionally high score. And Sam had, in turn, put pressure on my daughter to help her cheat.

I have felt for a long time that Sam is not a genuine friend to Lily and has been trying to hold my daughter back to feel better about her own poor choices. And I had spoken to Lily about this before, and to not let Sam manipulate her into anything she knows is wrong. Lily told me that she had understood yet did this.

I told Lily that, to prove she will take her education seriously from now on, she will need to come up with the fee for her future tests and college applications on her own. I suggested she start working odd jobs (such as babysitting or dog walking for the neighbors) to save up early.

Despite telling me she understood, the time to register for the next test is approaching, and my daughter asked me to pay because she is short on cash and her school will not offer the test again until spring. She brought up the original excuse that Sam pressured her into cheating.

I told my daughter no. I am not going back on my word, and she will learn to treat these opportunities with respect once she has to earn it herself. I also told Lily that she needs to stop letting Sam manipulate her, and if she can’t stand up to her then maybe she doesn’t have the mental maturity for college.

Our extended family became involved in the disagreement and are insisting that we cover the fee because it’s for her education and is important for college. I am not allowing them to cover the fee for Lily because it’s undermining my lesson. Inevitably, someone pretending to be her friend is going to pressure her to cheat again in college. Then when she gets caught again, I will wind up losing thousands of dollars and Lily will lose her shot at a good education. Her college journey won’t last long regardless unless she learns responsibility now. Even though she spent her money poorly and doesn’t have enough now, she will be able to wait and test in spring, even if it’s a less convenient time for her. AITA For putting my foot down with Lily and our family?

Edited to answer comments:

Lily is now a junior in high school. Taking the test in spring will not delay Lily's college applications. If she takes the test in spring, or even decides to retry during the summer, her score will still be available for her to use by the time fall applications roll around.

I have also broken down the math in multiple comments already. Lily had and still has ample time and opportunity to save up. If she spends her money wisely this time, she will have more than enough to cover the fees.

I’ve had a difficult relationship with my son for years. He’s into breakdancing, and for a long time, I honestly didn’t take it seriously. I was always focused on my daughter, who’s academically gifted and has been racking up awards left and right. I’m not proud of this, but I was that dad who always went to my daughter’s ceremonies and completely brushed off my son’s dance competitions. I think deep down, I didn’t see it as “real” success, and I’m ashamed to even admit that.

A few months ago, everything came to a head when my son finally broke down and told me how unappreciated he felt. He said I made him feel like he wasn’t good enough, like nothing he did mattered compared to his sister’s achievements. That hit me hard because I also had an absent father. Since then, I’ve been making a real effort to attend his competitions and show him I’m proud of what he loves. It’s been helping we’ve been repairing our relationship, and I’ve seen how much it means to him to finally have me there.

But now, my daughter has this big academic award ceremony for an essay she wrote on the same day as my son’s dance competition. There is a 40 minutes overlap between the two events. She told me she’d be really sad if I didn’t come to see her get her award, and I know she deserves my support too. She’s worked so hard and deserves to be celebrated just as much.

I feel like no matter what I choose, I’m going to hurt one of my kids, and I just don’t know what to do but I feel like if I go to her award ceremony, my son will think I’m just going back to my old ways, prioritizing her achievements over his passion.

I feel like no matter what I choose, I’m going to hurt one of my kids, and I just don’t know what to do but I feel like if I go to her award ceremony, my son will think I’m just going back to my old ways, prioritizing her achievements over his passion. I’ve failed my son so many times before. I don’t want to keep failing him. So I'm considering not to attend the award ceremony. ",1.0,1.057330846786499,1,1
103,1fjexu3,AITA for asking my boyfriend to cook dinner?,"So my boyfriend is much more “into cooking” than I am. He likes looking up recipes and decided what he’ll make for the week, and I’m not picky so I just let him. Plus, he usually doesn’t like the food I cook, which is fine, I know I don’t know what I’m doing.

On Sundays we buy groceries and I never ask questions and I just split the bill for whatever ingredients he wants. Yesterday he got home at 6 and said he was too tired to cook so I offered to pay for dinner. We went out and I spent $50.

Then today he gets home and says he had a big lunch and isn’t hungry. I ask him if he’ll be hungry later and he says he doesn’t know and I should just do whatever I want. I express being annoyed that we spent $80 on groceries and now I still have to figure out my own food when I thought we had a plan. I also think it’s just not a very nice thing to say “do whatever you want,” and “well I’m not hungry” when he knows I haven’t had dinner and I bought him a pricey meal yesterday! He then begrudgingly said “fine, I’ll cook you dinner,” which obviously I don’t want, like why the attitude? Then he raises his voice and screams at me to leave him alone.

Am I the asshole here? I wasn’t trying to be. I just think he could have been a bit nicer off the bat, idk why he got so angry.

104,1fjeudf,AITA for letting my boyfriend snap at my friend?,"Hi Reddit goers! You’ll have to forgive me if I make a few mistakes, this is my first time doing this.

I have a friend, who for this post I’ll refer to her as Lily (fake name) A few years ago me and Lily used to be very close despite the fact we met online. It was a big thing of we’d constantly hang out in any ways we could; even going as far as to say we’d 100% meet up one day.

Insert Charlotte (also fake name) , her current girlfriend/used to be ex. Long story short, their relationship is complicated to say the least. I won’t go into too much detail but Charlotte isn’t a very good person.

When I first met Charlotte I was already not fond of her, especially since I noticed that she’d frequently drag Lily away from everybody. It once caused a massive argument between me and Lily who was brought to tears when I told her I didn’t appreciate it.

For a while I did get along with Charlotte even thought I noticed many red flags; she’d often surrounded herself around bad people and refused to cut them off despite constantly begging us for advice and complaining about them.

Very recently I have noticed a reaccuring pattern over the last few months which I brought up to my now boyfriend, Kieran (yet another fake name) who even tried to gently bring it up to Lily himself. Charlotte on the other hand wanted nothing to do with it.

Lily then promised she’d try and do better. And she did. For two days. 

I would like to add. I’m autistic so I might be acting over dramatic over nothing; I don’t like dealing with conflict head on so I had asked Kieran to help out.

Kieran sent her a very lengthy message, while it was a little harsh it was clear he was just being protective of me.

Lily sent back a message claiming all sorts of things, that Charlotte had apparently made up for what she’d done to her. Not to mention she went on a long rant about how she was suffering and many things I will not list.

108,1fjd0wp,AITA for wanting my own room?,"15F here

Like the title said, i desperately want my own room, I know I sound spoiled because there's children out there without homes while I'm here with privledges to food, water, an education, nice clothes, a phone, etc. But a part of me in the back of my head can't help but burn with jealousy when I see my cousins, friends, and classrooms having their own room. I can't help but compare my life to them

i sleep in the same bedroom as my brother and mom, and I’m sick of my family’s snoring and other noises when I’m trying to sleep. Whenever Im about to fall asleep, I always get woken up by snoring or something. 

I know that i'm insecure (you can tell based off my previous posts/replies on Reddit LOL) which might be the case for the jealousy. But I'm also a person who loves privacy and alone time and can't get enough of it. Due to that, I feel envious of the people my age who get to workout, cry, listen to music, and do essentially whatever the hell they want without the paranoia of a family member catching them. I feel envious of those who get to study, sleep, do work, etc without distraction, noise, or the uncomfortable feeling of doing things when others are watching. I feel envious of those who, after a long stressful day of school or work, can just lock themselves in their room and rest and relax and have space all to themselves. I feel envious of the people who can decorate their own rooms and and express themselves through it with posters, plushies, etc without their family judging them.

Maybe I am asking for a lot, I don't expect it to change but it felt good getting this off my chest and I want to find people on here to relate to 😭

i was originally going to do jam with my friend, but my mam said that i shouldn't as it'd be expensive and i wouldn't be able to help much (which is fair). so i went on my own, and we did a couple of hours of research together coming up with ideas (roughly 3-5 hours id say?). recently i came up with DIY Christmas ornaments, which my parents liked. however it looked very resource consuming to make them.

today, i was talking to my friend about the company thing and she said she was unsure if she was going to commit to hers or not (homemade sweets from her country) as her English isn't that great. i said i was unsure too on my idea, and later on that day i asked her if she wanted to work together on her sweets. she said yes and we're working together now (yay!!).

i told my mam this today, after school. she was on a treadmill at the time (this isn't really relevant). i told her about my day and how I'm now working with my friend. she sighed angrily, and told me to go away. as i was walking out she hit the remote off the treadmill table thing... i was confused on why she was so angry.

she finished up on the treadmill and came back in. and said to me ""can you list a reason why im mad about this?"" i said ""idk"" because... i didn't. she said that i basically stuck up the two fingers (alternate middle finger, im Irish ahaha) at them because i decided against their ideas and hours of research. i found it fair for her to be upset about that, so i stayed silent and just nodded. then she said how i was lazy for ""piggybacking"" off someone else's idea... which i found odd to say because- i actually recommended to my friend to sell those sweets for her company (this was last week), and also because they were coming up with ideas for me aswell... so technically am i being lazy either way?

anyway, she basically said i would just be sitting there with her when we sell at the trade fair, which i disagreed on and said i would also help make them, package, etc... then she was still mad at me and she's been weird to me the whole day now (its night rn).

then... she sent my dad to text me (he's in another country for work currently), he asked what i decided to do for the company (i knew clearly my mam told him to text me). i told him that i was working with my friend and he was surprised and a little annoyed. he said it was ""too late in the game"" to switch up like this... even though its literally the phase of idea generation and settling on what we're gonna do...

114,1fjbmny,AITA for cutting of a friend for not participating in my bridal shower when I barley asked anything of her and I did everything for her? This resulted into eventually cutting off another friend and her sister. ,"I had a really close friend that I basically made her whole bridal shower for her alone. I stayed at her house all day to make goods and bake all desserts even when I barley had money. I put it all on my credit card and just wanted to make her happy. She kind of just expected it from me and I always was a people pleaser at the time. Years later when it was my turn to get married, I got too shy to ask for help so I just asked her to make one dish only since I had multiple friends and family who were also helping and since I like doing things alone.

Fast forward to closer to my bridal, she tells me the dish is too hard to make given that she has kids and her mother passed away and has no one to care for them. Mind you, that her mother had passed away almost 5 years ago. I felt a little awkward thst she brought it up but I just said okay I understand. If it’s too hard, then you can just pick up a salad from Trader Joe’s or something super simple then so you can still be part of it. I’m not expecting too much. No worries. And she made another excuse that she needs to know if she has time. 

This rubs me the wrong way given that I did EVERYTHING for her. Broke my back for her and did the whole dessert table and cookies dishes for her and bought party gifts and even hyped up her whole wedding when no one wanted to dance since she never danced for anyone else. (Mind you she didn’t even look happy at my wedding and didn’t dance once). I told her the truth on how I felt and how I did so much for her and I felt hurt that now it’s my turn and I didn’t have support from her given that we were childhood close friends. She said that I basically have a bad heart for expecting the same thing as a friend. She said I always thought you were the most amazing friend until now because I didn’t think you were the type to hold on to things and do things only to expect things in return. Then she said where were you when my mother died huh? You texted me every day but you were out of town during her funeral?!!!! And she kept speaking of her mother and how life is hard even years later and she’ll try to help but friends shouldn’t expect someone to do something. She was getting nasty with her words. 


We had an argument and it got gross. I felt so hurt and weirded out. I told her I am actually not expecting the same, but the fact that you’re not willing to do anything makes me feel you actually used me as a friend and that yes love should be reciprocated to an extent or it’s only one way. 

Bridal shower day comes and she doesn’t bring me anything. I was kind of shocked and I tried to ease tension by hugging her and saying hi. She brought me a traditional shirt that I had I asked if I could borrow from her and she kind of just tossed it and hugged me. I was like hey I’m glad you came. She’s like can’t stay too long cuz of my kids. I was like hmm okay that’s fine I guess. She’s like you’re so busy with your new marriage, you barley have seen me now and I’m like ok let’s talk about this later given that I have a room full of girls waiting for me. Awkward. 

After my event was done and my wedding was done and she didn’t even show happiness, dance or anything. I contacted her saying how I felt and how it was weird that her husband did a no show too. And she said well I have kids so you wouldn’t know. It was all very passive aggressive and I kind of felt worried even expressing myself. She got crazy over the traditional shirt she let me borrow and said hey I don’t know when I’ll see you again so please I need it asap. Like as if I was going to steal it when I am literally a loyal and close friend. It was like she had resentment towards me she couldn’t say like a child. She tells my other close friend to grab the shirt for her and made it a bigger deal which resulted into a big fight and me eventually giving it to her friend and sister. Things got ugly and I stopped talking to all 3 of them and blocked them for my mental health. It felt that her, her sister taking her side, and my almost bff who was also being a little weird after it all just got weird with me after my wedding. 

I was looking through my wedding video and realized they all seemed so judgmental and my other newer friends were all dancing and hyping me and so happy. I had an amazing wedding without them but I just distanced myself from those 3 all together. Long story, but I think I did the right thing. Just have trouble processing it all.

115,1fjbj26,AITA: for calling my friend stupid and telling them to give up their dream ,"I have a question that's been on my mind. Last night at dinner, a friend shared that they were recently fired from their dream job at a hospital due to a lapse in judgment. They are a senior in nursing school with less than a year left and had been working as a PCT at the hospital. Although no patients were harmed, they edited dates on their tuition reimbursement application to get money they desperately needed for school. Their poor handling of the situation led HR to discover the fraud, and they were fired after confessing.

 I called them stupid for even doing that and more or less confessing to the incident especially knowing this is the place they wanted to work at after graduation , and should just said it was a download error and they got mad at me. I’ve apologized after the fact of how insensitive it sounded but I don’t feel like I was wrong for what I said 

My friend is heartbroken and deeply regrets their actions. They’re now wondering if it’s possible to get a job at that hospital again after finishing nursing school or if they might still be able to apply for the hospital's residency program in the future. Should they consider this a lost cause and move on, or is there a chance for redemption?

I told them it was a lost cause and they’re lucky they didn’t press charges.

116,1fjbgfh,AITA for not giving my best friend as much as he gives me?,"Me (17F) and my bestie friend (17M) have been friends for two years and a half. He is a huge gift giver. Generally he spends a lot of money buying stuff for himself but also for other ppl, which was very surprising to me when I first started being his friend because I had never had any friend that buys so many things and makes gifts so often, but hey! That’s cool! Only things is I never even been like that myself, and I don’t even have my own allowance or credit card unlike him, who sometimes receives a thousand dollars from his rich grandma or just receives money from his mom if he simply asks. So I can’t have the liberty of buying that many things to him in return, since that would imply me having my mom and dad pay for them, and im already embarrassed of asking for them to give me money to buy myself anything. They only give me money when it’s my bday or when I go out with friends, so whenever I get my own money, sorry, but I rather spend it on my own. Something I don’t get the liberty of doing unlike he does all the time. I always felt guilty when he gives me things but he usually says it’s fine and that he just likes giving others gifts because yeah, his love language is gift giving.

Thing is, he got upset at me and overall also others in general because he realize he doesn’t receive as much as he gives. He got mad at me because I don’t buy him food as often as he gets me food or gets him presents as often as he gets me presents. I’m not sure if this is off topic so I apologize if it is but I feel like it’s also worth noting that he was also mad about the fact that he invites me to his family parties a lot more and to outings with his family (like when they go shopping) while I barely do that. The reason I barely do that is because my family doesn’t have parties. Because we’re new to
The United States and they don’t have friends unlike his parents do. And when I go out with my family, my parents prefer spending it as a family rather than having other friends over, while ig he doesn’t actually have a good relationship with his family.

I always felt guilty of these differences, but I can’t control it. I rlly can’t and he knows I don’t even buy myself things often or that my family doesn’t have festivities for me to invite him to. But alas he’s very upset at me because ig I seem like I don’t even try? Or that I don’t put in effort? 

I told him that he has to accept that people aren’t gonna always be able to give him the same amount of gifts he gives, and that if that imbalance bothers him then he should stop giving gifts as often to those who don’t. To you know, balance it out and make it more fair. Rather than making ppl feel forced to buy him a gift back, even though they’re gifts and not favors.
