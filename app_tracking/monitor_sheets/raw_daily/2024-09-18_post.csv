0,1fju09l,AITA for reporting my classmates to the principal?,"I (trans man,18) was at a school event before school started. Some of my classmates ages 17-18 were there, and one of them pulled out a can of alcohol. The student who pulled it out drank all of it in one go. It was only 6:49 in the morning. At around 7:18 everyone decided to go up to school. 

The student who drank, drove a few people up to the school. I got a ride from someone else. We arrived at school around 8, and school starts at 9:15. Since nobody was in the school at the time myself and a few other students dropped our stuff in the main office. We then walked up to a park to join a few other classmates.

When I got to the park, one student had pulled out a bong and started to pass it around. I said no due to health reasons. There were only six of us there, including myself. They all got pretty high but I stayed sober. I skipped first period to make sure that they didn't do anything stupid/get hurt. 

We arrived back at school during the beginning of second period. I walked down from the park while two students from the group who smoked drove the others down.

Later during the day I went to the principal and told her about what happened. She said that she was proud of me for looking out for my fellow students, but disappointed that I was the one to report it. I'm now being eaten from the inside by guilt and shame. 

So am I the asshole for reporting fellow classmates to the principal?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-09-18,"AITA for reporting my classmates to the principal?

1,1fjscoy,AITA for not thinking about how a gender affirming haircut would affect my family?,"I(16, transgender ftm) am living with my mom(45) in Germany, and have a dad(48) who is in Ukraine. They are together, but we moved because of the war and he isn't allowed to do so because of mobilization. 

Before everything, I want to specify that I am closeted but bad at hiding things, including my blog, so my parents know about me being trans. They are extremely transphobic and homophobic and I've been openly a part and huge activist of LGBT community since I was 10, so the environment in family definitely isn't good.

My dysphoria has been really bad recently and I know that something as simple  as masculine haircut can really improve my wellbeing. I asked my mom about it, specifying that it would be a really short one and she agreed, but I caught a cold so we had to delay everything. 

I have my birthday on autumn break in around a month and my mom booked tickets to go visit my dad in Ukraine, which means that I would need to celebrate it there. I wasn't thrilled about this idea as none of my friends are there, but I love my father and miss my country, so agreed on it. My plan was to get my haircut before it so I can feel more comfortable and have some pictures there I resemble myself more. 

Now that I am no longer sick, I showed my mom a picture of what I want(an undercut) to specify with my hairstylist if she can do that. I am unable to contact her without my mom as I don't have a smartphone(yes, at 17, that's a whole another story). I thought it was settled as my mom knew and previously agreed on everything, but she suddenly started to scream at me, calling me ""it"" and telling me that ""my dad wouldn't want to introduce you to anyone as his daughter if you're gonna look insane"". I tried to explain that it would make me feel a lot better about myself and it's something that we've attempted before(around 2 years ago I had an awful pixie cut cause hairdresser didn't want to make me look too ""boy-ish""). She started calling me ""it"", and told me that this would defeat the whole purpose of going to Ukraine as it would only make my dad feel worse, as ""If he would need to go to war, what would he have to fight for? Your gay parades? Have you even thought about how we would feel?"" so I had to apologize and give up on the idea. 

 I told my friends about this situation and they sided by me, but I think that I kinda was in the wrong here for not thinking about my dad's feelings about all of it and my mom just couldn't control her emotions as she cares about him deeply.

2,1fk3yik,AITA for not leaving a party early?,"I live with my two friends who are married. Let's call them Jane and John. We were going to go to a friend's party. I said I would drive separately from them because I like to stay out later. The day of John says he isn't feeling well and is not going to go. Jane did not feel like driving. She asked if she could tag along with me. I told her I have no idea when I would be coming home and I stay out late. She still didn't know if she wanted to go if that was the case. She texted another friend who lives down the road to see if she could catch a ride home with them if they leave before me. Our friend said yes. At that point she said that she would be okay going with me. Jane wasn't feeling great either. About an hour and a half into the party (just at a friend's house) she is laying down inside. We live 33 minutes away. So if I were take her home and come back it would be a half hour home, a half hour back, then a half hour to go home again and miss over an hour of the party that I don't even know will be going on by the time I get back

She texts me 3 hours after we arrive asking if I was going to leave soon. I said I don't know when I planned on leaving. She wasn't really present for the party the rest of the night. Our other friend and I ended up staying super later. Like 2:20am late.
Around Midnight she called her husband John and had him pick her up.

Jane and John are mad with me because according to Jane the moment she got in my car she was my responsibility. I made it very clear that I had no idea what time I would be home. In my view she knew the risk. She didn't even want to go with me until she had another option home. She isn't even that mad with our friend that lives down the road for not taking her home either even though it was only the offer from that friend that convinced Jane to go with me to the party. To avoid the risk she could have driven herself. I felt a little bad the the chances didn't work out and that our friend and I decided to stay later than she expected, but it was her decision to take the risk and she could have driven herself with no risk of being out too late. 

I was one of her two ways home and she couldn't get home herself.
I warned her in advance that I might be out all night

Would it have been nice for me to leave the party early? Sure. Am I the asshole for not?

3,1fk3x20,AITA for clarifying how I met my friend?,"Ok, I (19F) am Mexican but I’ve been studying in Canada for about a year now and honestly I’m still adjusting to the way things are here. It’s so different from back home and sometimes I feel like people take things way too seriously over stuff that to me is just normal.

The other day I posted an Insta story wishing a friend from back home a happy birthday. I wrote it in Spanish (obviously), something simple like ""Happy 21st! Have the best day, miss you handsome!🫶🏼😙"" Later, when I was hanging out with some friends here, one of the girls asked who the guy in the story was and what it said because she couldn’t understand it.

I told her he’s a friend of mine turning 21, and she asked if we went to high school together. I kinda laughed and said, ""Oh no, he’s actually the son of my maid back in Mexico."" And suddenly things got super awkward. The whole vibe in the room just changed, and I honestly didn’t know why. I wasn’t being mean or anything, just telling the truth?

Later, one of my other friends texted me saying that what I said was so tone deaf and that it sounded weird to bring up that he’s my maid’s son. She told me I should’ve just called him a friend and left it at that. But here’s the thing in Mexico so many people have maids. It’s honestly really common, and being friends with someone’s kid doesn’t feel like some huge deal. I wasn’t trying to flex or make it about social class. I was literally just trying to give context.

I guess I can see how it might’ve sounded off to them? But I still don’t really get why it’s such a big deal. It’s frustrating because some people here always assume Mexico is this super poor country where everyone’s struggling or living in the desert or something. And honestly, I’m kind of over it. It feels like I’m always having to explain that we have normal lives too. Back home no one would think twice about me mentioning that a friend is my maid’s son.

7,1fk3kvt,AITA for refusing to let my friend’s wife move into our house?,"A little background, this friend I bought a house with and I have known each other for almost 20 years now. Last year, we decided it's in our financial best interest to get a house. Before we had even closed, I agreed that one of the spare bedrooms could be rented out by her on-again-off-again boyfriend of about 12 years. I know him, he has a steady job and is a nice guy. Three adult incomes lessens the financial burden of a mortgage these days, so we could focus on saving.
 I will say this not from a place of judgement but from one of conveying all of the facts: this friend does not consider herself polyamorous but in her relationship with her boyfriend, she is allowed to date women and not have it be considered ""cheating"". He has however, in private, referred to it as cheating. Meanwhile I have known her long enough to have seen her cycle through at LEAST four relationships with women where it is casual, then intense and serious, and then they break up.
This year, this friend has been seeing a new girl since May. This friend and I typically talk every day. I find it annoying when she's in these ""all-in"" relationships, so we hang out a lot less, but we live in the same house, I am easy to get into contact with. 
Previously, she’s referred to these women she's dated in the past as her wife. None have lived with her. So I think little of it. 
This all comes to a head a few days ago when I’m home alone and (not for the first time) this girlfriend who does not live in our house came in unannounced. I texted my friend and asked why her guest was in our home when she is not. To which she responded that that was her wife who was always doing things for her so ""of course she's gonna be around but has a lease til may"". Which I realized was an implication that, without so much as bringing this to me as a discussion, she intended to move this girl into the house. Obviously a fight ensued where I insisted that the house belongs to both of us and whoever lives here has to be spoken about and decided by both of us. To which she replied -and this is the exact quote- ""We have a 30 year mortgage did you just assume I would live alone?"" To which I will remind the dear reader that her boyfriend currently lives in the bedroom next to mine. Infuriated mostly by what has been a complete disregard for me as a person, a so-called friend and most importantly an owner of the house, I looked into the laws in PA and found that the law is on my side and that, regardless of marital status (whether or not that's real idgaf) the property owners have to agree on who lives in the house.

This all comes to a head a few days ago when I’m home alone and (not for the first time) this girlfriend who does not live in our house came in unannounced. I texted my friend and asked why her guest was in our home when she is not. To which she responded that that was her wife who was always doing things for her so ""of course she's gonna be around but has a lease til may"". Which I realized was an implication that, without so much as bringing this to me as a discussion, she intended to move this girl into the house. Obviously a fight ensued where I insisted that the house belongs to both of us and whoever lives here has to be spoken about and decided by both of us. To which she replied -and this is the exact quote- ""We have a 30 year mortgage did you just assume I would live alone?"" To which I will remind the dear reader that her boyfriend currently lives in the bedroom next to mine. Infuriated mostly by what has been a complete disregard for me as a person, a so-called friend and most importantly an owner of the house, I looked into the laws in PA and found that the law is on my side and that, regardless of marital status (whether or not that's real idgaf) the property owners have to agree on who lives in the house. 
Obviously from her perspective I'm being unreasonable and mean, but I'm interested if people who are not involved at all in this would also see it that way.",0.0,0.0094215841963887,0,1
8,1fk3g9a,WIBTA if I uninvite my (ex) stepdad and his wife to my wedding?,"I (28m) am getting married at the end of September. We are having small ceremony, a dinner reception at a local Italian restaurant, and an after party at a private arcade bar which we have more guests invited to - mostly friends who we were not able to invite to the wedding - we will be catering late night street tacos for everyone. 

We will be paying for the restaurant dinner out of a combination of monetary gifts as well as our own funds (about half and half.) We have invited my stepdad and his wife to the wedding ceremony and dinner reception and we invited my stepmom’s daughter (21f) to the bar party (the other two kids are too young.) 

Some months ago we reached out to my stepdad and his wife to ask if they would be willing to offer us a 2.5k loan for wedding expenses that we would pay back on whatever terms worked for them - they declined to offer the loan but did offer $500 as a “wedding gift, you will not have to pay it back.” That was very generous of them and we expressed that and went on our way, we discussed we would reach out closer to the date to get the money. 

Between then and now we realized there had been miscommunication where my stepmom assumed I would also be inviting her children (21f, 17m, 13f) to our wedding - we clarified that this was not in our budget or our plan and that it would only be them two who are invited. We don’t have any hard feelings at all towards these kids, we all get along really well and have a lot of fun - it’s just not in the budget and me personally I would have been relieved not to be invited to a wedding for someone I’ve only known 5 years who I only see on Holidays. 

We reached out today to confirm about transferring the $500 and stepmom responded that since the kids were not invited that they assumed we did not need that money anymore, that they had offered it in part to pay for their meals. They said they had used that money to instead buy the kids day passes to a local amusement park since they would not be coming to the wedding and they had “already taken the day off” so they had nothing else to do for the day. (The 21yo doesn’t even live with them anymore.) 

To be honest this seems vindictive and retaliatory and I’m feeling like I might not really want them there anymore due to the cattiness. It’s a very small ceremony and dinner. They do not get along with my mom or my dad (who are divorced also) so having them on the guest list has been a lot of extra work for us because if they were not coming we wouldn’t need to bother with seating charts or behavioral anxiety since everyone else gets along just fine.

it is very likely this would ruin our relationship permanently and I’m still deciding if I am okay with that. 

So, WIBTA if I told my stepdad how I’m feeling about this and requested that he and his wife no longer attend?

11,1fk33n0,"AITA for telling my girlfriend it wasn’t okay to wake me up in the middle of the night, even though she felt unsafe?","So, this happened recently, and I’m not sure if I’m in the wrong here. My girlfriend called me in the middle of the night after being out drinking with friends. I had an extremely important and long workday ahead (she knew it), and I was already running on too little sleep.

When she called, she said she missed me and just wanted to talk. I told her I really needed to sleep because of my early start and how tired I was. She asked if I could stay on the phone with her for another 10 minutes, and we ended up having a nice conversation before I went back to bed.

The next day, I told her that while I understood she wanted to talk, it really wasn’t okay for me to be woken up like that, especially when I had such a demanding day ahead. Her response was that she felt unsafe walking home at night and that she needed to hear my voice to feel better. I sticked to my point. Then she  said I was being an asshole for not understanding the female perspective and how unsafe it can feel to be alone on a street at night. Also that I am an asshole because she needed to ask for my help.

I told her I get that it can be scary, but I still think she could have called someone else who was awake or even ordered a taxi instead of waking me up when I had such an important day ahead.

I obviously want to be there for her when she needs me, but I still think it’s unreasonable to wake someone up for a non-emergency in the middle of the night, especially when it’s going to mess up their day.

AITA?

Edit: Thank you so much for helping me reflecting myself. I was definitely the AH because otherwise the „I want to be always there for you“ are just empty words. Also I was mad of myself for not having enough sleep and the 30minutes I gave her is in no relation to give her the feeling of safety.

I think the main reason, I wanted to set this boundary is because of another conflict which had nothing to do with that one.

I’ve been working for a contract for a year and I’ve made some short term friends in the city. My accommodation is paid for by the company and on occasion I use my time off to visit them while they’re on shift. Here’s the thing though… on my days off I explore, I see new sights, I go to different municipalities, cities, towns, etc. I have on numerous occasions asked, said friends particularly (we’ll call them Sarah and Meagan) to go do things with me since I am not from here, but they don’t ever want to because they’ve worked a long day or they have plans the next day and on their days off don’t go out of their way to visit or do anything once I’m off shift. 

So. Today we got word that our contract is ending and the people that were accommodated by the company are going back to where they came from. Now that that news is out is when Meagan and Sarah have reached out to want to go out. However, I have plans the days they chose and there is still like 16 days left. If you exclude the two days I said I have plans - that leaves 14. 

So now Meagan and Sarah are lashing out at me that I’m a jerk for not changing my plans or going out of my way to see them either of those two days. Over the last year I have asked them out to go for dinners or brunches, casual drinks, never with any sort of intention behind it mind you - they’re partnered up - and even being said partners but they always have an excuse or don’t want to simply because they work the next day. 

Granted I have a more free lifestyle and am being made feel bad for not accommodating them. So I’ve simply said - you can pick a different day that isn’t those two and we’re good. Meagan has one of those days off so it’s convenient for her to be going out the night before or the day of. Sarah is just wanting to go  either way. However, I’m not changing my plans nonetheless.

Here’s the thing though… on my days off I explore, I see new sights, I go to different municipalities, cities, towns, etc. I have on numerous occasions asked, said friends particularly (we’ll call them Sarah and Meagan) to go do things with me since I am not from here, but they don’t ever want to because they’ve worked a long day or they have plans the next day and on their days off don’t go out of their way to visit or do anything once I’m off shift. 

So. Today we got word that our contract is ending and the people that were accommodated by the company are going back to where they came from. Now that that news is out is when Meagan and Sarah have reached out to want to go out. However, I have plans the days they chose and there is still like 16 days left. If you exclude the two days I said I have plans - that leaves 14. 

So now Meagan and Sarah are lashing out at me that I’m a jerk for not changing my plans or going out of my way to see them either of those two days. Over the last year I have asked them out to go for dinners or brunches, casual drinks, never with any sort of intention behind it mind you - they’re partnered up - and even being said partners but they always have an excuse or don’t want to simply because they work the next day. 

Granted I have a more free lifestyle and am being made feel bad for not accommodating them. So I’ve simply said - you can pick a different day that isn’t those two and we’re good. Meagan has one of those days off so it’s convenient for her to be going out the night before or the day of. Sarah is just wanting to go  either way. However, I’m not changing my plans nonetheless. I may never see these people again after September. AITA? ",0.0,0.0072427056729793,0,1
17,1fk2idn,AITA for telling my boyfriend to poop in the 2nd bathroom when i’m using ours?,"My boyfriend takes like 7 shits a day. Whatever. We live in a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with our 4 year old and cat. 
Since he’s constantly pooping, it’s a frequent occurrence that he will go in our master bathroom while I’m in the middle of getting ready for work etc. and drop a nasty shit. I have to sit there for fucking 10 minutes waiting so I can get back in there and then I have to finish getting ready in his stanky poop air. I’m being so serious yall. I just think it’s rude to knowingly blow up the bathroom someone is using to get ready when there’s a perfectly functioning other bathroom. He just “doesn’t like it” as much. So im forced to breathe toxic ass air. He laughs it off and thinks i’m being extra. I think he needs to cut the shit. (Pun intended)

He’d just be using the toilet, whereas I need my things that are kept in our bathroom. So AITA for requesting he use the other bathroom when i’m using ours to get ready?

ETA it’s also been an issue leaving the door wide open after he’s done blowing up the bathroom and it makes the entire bedroom stink, but he’s gotten a bit better about this. He says he “doesn’t smell anything.”

The 2nd toilet is the exact same as ours, and is actually cleaner than ours. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-18,"AITA for telling my boyfriend to poop in the 2nd bathroom when i’m using ours?

18,1fk2ern,AITA for refusing to watch sisters kids,"I'm being asked through my mother to pick up my nephew from school and watch him until his parents get home. The reasoning is that the mother works until the evening and the father doesn't have time due to lack of sleep. Since I have a more fluid schedule they are all just assuming that I have the time to set out my day to do this, which I don't. There's too many variables in this equation like having to wait for them to get here at set time, traffic delays would cause for my schedule being thrown off and missing important appointments which is added stress onto my already depressive issues. 

It wouldn't be an everyday thing (So they say...But that's how it starts) , I would have to be ""On-Call"" so to speak which adds even more uncertainty and would have to free up time just in case. I don't have children, for various reasons but I feel like if you have children you should be able to take care of them and choosing a career that allows you do so. So i feel that just because I don't have children it's expected of me to pick up for the family.

I understand that sometimes people need help but why does it have to be me? There is toxicity involved here with parents. Why wouldn't I even be asked flat out, but instead by a 3rd party? I feel like I shouldn't be berated for my decision to not add extra stress onto my plate. My mother says I am wrong for not taking care of family like it’s my duty. Sister won’t even talk to me.

19,1fk1sob,AITA for spending my money on something nice for myself?,"I’m a (22)F who has been in a relationship with my (23)M boyfriend for 5 years. Recently we have been fighting a lot more and has mostly been about money. He constantly gets upset with me how I use my money or spend it.

We are currently saving up money for my dad’s wedding which will be held in Honolulu. We agreed that we would both pull out $1,000 to put towards the trip, I pulled out $1,500 so that I have some money to spend on clothes and a dress for the trip as well. After buying the things I needed I noticed I still had $1,308 so I decided that while I had that I can at least get myself something nice right? I got a new desk for my gaming setup and a nice chair bc mine was falling apart (literally). Even got a cool jellyfish lamp to add to my setup. 

When my boyfriend got home, he noticed the new desk and chair and asked me what is this, I responded saying “I got these for a nice upgrade from the old desk and chair, it’s pretty nice isn’t it?” He replied back saying no and was upset with me bc I spent money that I “don’t have”, even mention how he’s stressing that he can’t make $1,000 for the trip and hasn’t been able to buy himself nice things.
It felt kinda selfish to me that he went off on me like that and it makes me feel like I shouldn’t have bought myself that. 

I want to understand better but he won’t ever actually talk to me about these things. It’s always yelling and fighting. Am I the selfish one? Or is he being selfish?

ADDING THIS NOTE: I’m being asked a lot about how much I have really. I have $12k In total saved up and have been investing that money for years so even as I write this, it’s still going up. Very rarely do I ever pull out that money. 

UPDATE: After readings some of the comments I took initiative to have a conversation about this even if it makes him uncomfortable. I want us both to be happy. After a while he opened up to me and admitted he is financially stressed out. The first few months he’s been paying the bills bc it’s been hard for me to find a job out here, ( I do have a job now that I’ve been with for a month now). He did express that right now he’s not happy and until we are both more stable he will be. I expressed that the way we’ve been communicating about it has been hard on me and has not made me happy.

21,1fk0wo0,AITA for telling my dad (45M) that I don’t want him to be dating my old friend/roommate/coworker (25F),"My parents divorced when I was 15. I am 25 and female. My dad and (Brenda) started texting back in January of 2024, but they’ve known one another when I first moved in with my friend at 19. She used to clean his house. Last year, she lost her job, and moved in with her parents in a different state. She came to town in March, wanted to see me, I had no clue that her plans were to see my dad that whole weekend. She left me early on in the night. My little sisters were with dad, saw him hugging and kissing someone in the backyard, they told my mom. The next time I saw my mom, she informed me of this, and mentioned that the girls think it might be Brenda. I told her that’s a coincidence because Brenda was just in town. My mom decides to text my dad and get information, and he confirmed it was Brenda. But not to tell me until they were ready. 
In May he asked to chat with me. I made it a point to tell him that I do want to hear him out. All I got was how happy Brenda makes him, how cool it would be if I were to be on board with this. The conversation went nowhere, I had to call him an hour after I talked with him, to tell him I don’t want him to continue seeing Brenda. He ended it with “I understand” I still feel like I didn’t get proper closure from him, so I texted him asking when he plans to end it, he said he would let me know. Which brings us to today, since then he hasnt tried to end it.

 Last week my sisters caught him lying about his whereabouts. They spoted that he has a new tattoo, of a bad looking grilled cheese. (They post nonstop about grilled cheese on FB, and she also sported a new tattoo). Somehow, one of his exes finds my tiktok, and rips him a new one, he still doesn’t care. Even his own mother. His siblings and their SOs support him. I get an email at 9pm from my dad about how I should’ve given Brenda a chance, since I had blocked her the moment everything surfaced. That I need to take the tiktok down, for her. He told me I shouldn’t really listen to mom or my sisters because they are “unreliable” sources. He’s the happiest ever. He wanted to have a face to face conversation again, either him and I, me Brenda and him. I don’t want to hear him out again. He said he’d walk through fire for me. I did respond to the email, I didn’t hold anything back on my feelings. He’s an adult, and can make selfish decisions, but if he continues, I won’t be in either of their lives. I truly fear, that I will lose my relationship with my dad, I know he’s going to choose her. And if my some miracle he ends the relationship, what then? How can we fix this? He could be dating any random 25 year old, the part that hurts the most is it’s an old friend, roommate, coworker. I’ll never want to rekindle anything with her, I can’t cut dad off.

I work in a white collar job in a city, which unfortunately has many unhoused people.

23,1fk0rrw,AITA I think I've caused a permanent family rift with my half sister ,"Today I(38M) had a big fight with my sister.

In September 2022 my dad (my sisters step dad) died. Our mum(78F) still owned half the house my dad lived in after the divorced back in 1991. I inherited my dad's half. There has never been any argument over the money. What I got from my dad is mine and what she gets from her dad is hers. Anything from our mum is split.

Our mum lives in a council bungalow for the over 65s ( I guess like a retirement village?). In June 2024 me and my mum sold the house my dad lived in, neither of us could live in the house due to too many bad memories.

I do not have enough money to buy a house in the area my family all live in (Surrey) without starting a considerable mortgage at 38. I'd have to borrow at least 200k for even a 2 bedroom flat.

I found a 4 bedroom house within my budget in Essex but it's 1.5-2 hours drive away depending on traffic.

My sister had no problem with me moving this far away.

My mum is no longer eligible for benefits since we sold the house and if she stays living in her bungalow withing 12 years she would have sent everything she got on rent.

So I asked my mum to come live with me when my house sale has completed, she would save close to £1100 pcm living with me rent/mortgage free compared to living in her council bungalow. Deal being I buy the house and she pays all the bills till I find a job in the new area and 50% of bills after that (leaving her £1100 a month better off once I am working).

Today my sister cried to our mum that I am splitting out family up and how I'm taking her mum away and its to far to drive for a visit without staying over (""i cant take time off work""....she is a self employed cleaner). 

We explained the only way we could get something ideal for mum and closer was if I borrowed money from our mum, bought a more expensive house, and when mum dies I have to sell my home so my sister can have her inheritance. I am not happy with this option because if mum lives till she is 100 that is 22 years and I would have to sell up and move at close to 60 years old with no younger family to help. My sister didn't see a problem with this.

I admittedly lost my temper a bit because I have lived an hour drive from our family before, no one ever visited me. It was always be driving from Farnborough to Surrey and back, every other weekend. That it pissed me off no one ever visited me back then and that it only seems to be because mum is coming with me.

My sister stormed out and I can't see us speaking again, she seems more than happy for me to not have a good home life as long as she doesn't have to drive to far.


Am I being an arsehole?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-18,"AITA I think I've caused a permanent family rift with my half sister  Today I(38M) had a big fight with my sister.

In September 2022 my dad (my sisters step dad) died. Our mum(78F) still owned half the house my dad lived in after the divorced back in 1991. I inherited my dad's half. There has never been any argument over the money. What I got from my dad is mine and what she gets from her dad is hers. Anything from our mum is split.

Our mum lives in a council bungalow for the over 65s ( I guess like a retirement village?). In June 2024 me and my mum sold the house my dad lived in, neither of us could live in the house due to too many bad memories.

I do not have enough money to buy a house in the area my family all live in (Surrey) without starting a considerable mortgage at 38. I'd have to borrow at least 200k for even a 2 bedroom flat.

I found a 4 bedroom house within my budget in Essex but it's 1.5-2 hours drive away depending on traffic.

My sister had no problem with me moving this far away.

My mum is no longer eligible for benefits since we sold the house and if she stays living in her bungalow withing 12 years she would have sent everything she got on rent.

So I asked my mum to come live with me when my house sale has completed, she would save close to £1100 pcm living with me rent/mortgage free compared to living in her council bungalow. Deal being I buy the house and she pays all the bills till I find a job in the new area and 50% of bills after that (leaving her £1100 a month better off once I am working).

Today my sister cried to our mum that I am splitting out family up and how I'm taking her mum away and its to far to drive for a visit without staying over (""i cant take time off work""....she is a self employed cleaner). 

We explained the only way we could get something ideal for mum and closer was if I borrowed money from our mum, bought a more expensive house, and when mum dies I have to sell my home so my sister can have her inheritance. I am not happy with this option because if mum lives till she is 100 that is 22 years and I would have to sell up and move at close to 60 years old with no younger family to help.

24,1fk0o38,AITA for not inviting my coworker for drinks on my last day?,"My last day of work at my (kinda toxic) job is coming up soon. My sister, who lives on a different continent, is visiting with her husband, so I was planning to get drinks with them and some of the colleagues / ex-colleagues that I‘m friends with. I wasn’t planning to invite everyone, but the problem is that my colleague Janelle keeps asking if I’m going out for drinks after work. She asked me last week, and I told her I wasn’t sure yet since my sister is visiting. Then, a day later. she asked another colleague if he knew what my plans are. 

To be honest, I really don’t want to invite her. I’ve tried to be nice and keep a pleasant working relationship with her, but I don’t trust her. She found out that I was leaving by eavesdropping on a private call I was having with a coworker, then lied and said that he told her. She’s also VERY close with my boss (who is the main reason I’m leaving this job), which makes a lot of people on the team not trust her. Nobody feels like they can vent about work in front of her without risking her telling the boss. To top it off, she never actually seems to have fun at these kinds of events— she just sits there for half an hour silently listening, then makes an excuse for why she has to leave. 

I don’t want to make her feel excluded, but I was really looking forward to a fun night of blowing off steam, and this is kind of killing the vibe! And now other people at work have also heard her asking about it and want to know if they can go for drinks with me too.

26,1fk0k4w,AITA for dancing bachata with my best friend even though this girl has a crush on him?,"About a month and a half ago we had this big holiday in my country and I (15F) went to a party with a bunch of friends, including my best friend Felipe (17M) and this girl Ana (15F). Now, Ana has had a crush on Felipe for a while like three months ago she told me. And honestly, I thought it was cute, I even tried to help her out and be supportive because that’s what a good friend does, right?

But the thing is Felipe and I have been best friends since we were FIVE. Our parents are best friends too, so we've literally grown up together. He’s like my brother so there is zero romantic connection between us (ew🤢). It’s just that we’re super close because we’ve known each other forever so we have this natural connection.

Anyway, at this party, things were going great, and when a bachata song came on (Deja Vu by Shakira and Prince Royce which is like the go to bachata song for all parties here) Felipe approached me to dance. And I’m not gonna lie it’s kinda our thing to dance together. We’ve been doing it for years, it’s honestly not even that deep. I’ve danced with other friends and even my dad. But apparently Ana didn’t see it that way.

She disappeared for a while, and later I found out she’d been crying in the bathroom. She left the party early and now she’s ignoring me. Some of our mutual friends are saying that I’m a bad friend and not a girls girl for dancing with *her crush* because it was supposedly seductive??? It’s just a dance??? Felipe asked *me*, and I wasn’t gonna say no to my best friend just because someone likes him. And now she’s telling people I betrayed her, but I didn’t even realize it was that serious!

I get that she likes him and I’m not trying to hurt her feelings but is it really my fault that Felipe asked me to dance? And I mean we’ve been friends since forever, so it's not like I’m trying to steal her crush or whatever. Plus, it feels like she’s overreacting a bit, its just a song, it’s not *that* seductive, and it’s kinda gross people are trying to make it out to be more than it is and making me seem like I'm some kind of evil seductress to the guy who is basically part of MY FAMILY🤢.

27,1fk0hp9,AITA to see my dying grandpa and ignoring my sister,"I am still living at home and so is my sister. Five months ago my grandpa came out with stage 4 cancer, we panicked and went to see him straight away. We stayed for 2 weeks before coming back home. My sister's main reason is that I can't keep my discipline over there. It's not like how my home is. In my home, we have an office and monitors and we all sit together at work. But in my grandparent's house, it's the complete opposite. I don't know why but whenever I go over there I can't control myself. It's like I lose myself and I go into a hiding hole and stay there for most of the day. I eat a lot and I always gain weight when I go over there. It's like I'm the opposite of who I am over there. I last saw them 5 months ago but 2 days ago I got a message from my grandpa letting the family know that the cancer spread to his spine and requesting that his grandkids call him. I called him and we talked. He wants to see me. I talked to my dad and he said it was okay. I only want a week. I feel like I can hold myself for a week. But my sister is saying no, She's saying that because I never did hold myself and I always fell into that hiding hole seeing nobody person that she doesn't even want me to go.

I feel that she's right. Maybe I don't have it in me to be there when my grandpa wants me to. I want to believe it will be different but my experience is telling me it's not. But not seeing him at all just feels like a kick in the face to my grandpa. I am going to do a week of school so I can be there and have no thoughts about school so I won't fall apart. I'm trying to plan as many safety plans so that when I go there I don't fall back into it. But I feel like it won't even matter. My sister is not going to let me go no matter what I say but I just want to push past her and go on the trip. But I feel like she's right. I just don't know what I will do if I don't go. I'd rather deal with the whole lazy part of me and see him than not see him at all and live in regret. I'm worried about how I will feel about my family after his death. I feel like I will be angry towards them. Why couldn't they let me go? I'm old enough to make my own decisions but I'm not an adult. I won't be able to move past it.

I go over to his room all the time since we moved in on Saturday. And use his towels for when I get a shower there (it’s so much better showering at his because he has an en suite room and I share with 5 people) or putting on the bed for sex. 

He explains the issue, most people including us don’t use the laundry at the place and instead intend to just bring our clothes home on the weekends and do it there instead because it’s a big hassle and horribly set up at the accommodation and most people do just take it all home for simplicity. And he’s already running low like projected to not have a usable one of Friday before he goes home if I come over, which idk how that’s possible, you can get a few uses out of each for showers and as for the other… he’s a guy once it’s dry he shouldn’t care lol

He I asked if I could bring some for myself when coming over and I said no because that’s stupid because IT IS and he didn’t argue with me over it but he sounded a little annoyed. But idk I think he’s being a little ridiculous, like over the top with how little you can use a towel, he has a good few if he uses them like twice each time he should be fine.

29,1fk01tg,AITA for skimming some parts of my friend’s romance novel when she asked me for feedback?,"So I’m a writer who has had 2 short story collections published along with some things in literary magazines. In other words, I write navel gazing literary fiction about women in their 20s with limited appeal to the masses. It’s what I like to read, it’s what I like to write. And my friends know this.

My friend ‘Chelsie’ is also a writer and asked me if I could read her romance novel and give her feedback. She has other people giving her feedback as well. I told her that I don’t really read romance, so I’m not her target audience, but I would give her the best feedback I could.

So about a month after I give Chelsie my feedback, we’re hanging out with some friends and chatting about books, and I happened to mention that I generally skip sex scenes and overly romantic scenes in books. I’ve just never wanted to read about fictional people having sex. It’s weird to me, same as I’ve never really gotten into the whole watching pornography thing. I skip sex scenes in movies, tv, etc. It’s just boring filler to me, like someone reading off a list of numbers or something. 

Anyway, Chelsie perked up and asked me what I thought about the scenes in her books, since I gave feedback. I told her that I’d skipped that part. She got offended and asked me why I hadn’t said that to her. I didn’t think I had to – I was mostly giving her feedback on the writing style, dialogue, word choice, etc.

She has taken this to mean that I skimmed the whole thing and thought her sex scenes were boring and badly written, and made a few snippy comments about the books I read and how boring and pretentious they are. Which, sure. I know plenty of people find them boring.

31,1fjzmqp,WIBTA if I called my roommate a bad friend because she won't call out of work?,"Me and my roommate (both 23) have been friends for two years now and lived together for one. We moved across the country several months ago after I got accepted to a grad program (she's done with school). It took a while for her to get a job, but she'll be starting next week. 

Great! Except I've developed a really bad infection that urgently needs to be treated with minor surgery. I had the exact same problem when I was 10 or so, and I had a terrible experience thanks to a shitty doctor. I was also friends with the doctor's daughter, and apparently he made fun of me crying during the surgery to her, and then she made fun of me for it at school. Thanks to that, I'm struggling with severe medical anxiety around all this. I already tried to have my current infection treated, but I had such a big panic attack at the doctor's office that I couldn't go through with it (she was there and saw all of this).

My new doctor and I opted to have me reschedule for next week and have me take valium beforehand to help me through it. I've never taken valium or anything like it before, but I'm told I shouldn't drive myself, and I don't feel safe taking public transport or Uber on a medication that I've never taken before. Since we just moved and I've been busy with my program, I don't know anyone else in the area very well. She's my only good option, but she doesn't want to call out for an afternoon during her first week of work. I've made it clear to her that if she won't help me, I'm left either doing this without anxiety management or with a near-stranger. She said she'd consider calling out if I could get an appointment very late in the day, but they don't have any, and she's not budging on calling out for a whole afternoon. 

I want to be empathetic to her own anxiety around committing an employment faux pas, but the stress of dealing with this on top of keeping my grades up is crushing me.

I had the exact same problem when I was 10 or so, and I had a terrible experience thanks to a shitty doctor. I was also friends with the doctor's daughter, and apparently he made fun of me crying during the surgery to her, and then she made fun of me for it at school. Thanks to that, I'm struggling with severe medical anxiety around all this. I already tried to have my current infection treated, but I had such a big panic attack at the doctor's office that I couldn't go through with it (she was there and saw all of this).

My new doctor and I opted to have me reschedule for next week and have me take valium beforehand to help me through it. I've never taken valium or anything like it before, but I'm told I shouldn't drive myself, and I don't feel safe taking public transport or Uber on a medication that I've never taken before. Since we just moved and I've been busy with my program, I don't know anyone else in the area very well. She's my only good option, but she doesn't want to call out for an afternoon during her first week of work. I've made it clear to her that if she won't help me, I'm left either doing this without anxiety management or with a near-stranger. She said she'd consider calling out if I could get an appointment very late in the day, but they don't have any, and she's not budging on calling out for a whole afternoon. 

I want to be empathetic to her own anxiety around committing an employment faux pas, but the stress of dealing with this on top of keeping my grades up is crushing me. WIBTA if I told her she's being a bad friend?",1.0,1.0267442464828491,1,1
32,1fjzjqb,AITA for Refusing to Watch My Grandparents Due to My Aunt's Poor Planning?,"I (28F) am facing a dilemma with my 92-year-old grandparents, who are visiting for three weeks. I was their part-time caretaker and helped run my grandfather’s business until he retired and they moved up north to live with my oldest aunt (69F).

The plan was to split their time between my mother's house and my aunt's house nearby (a 5 bed, 2 1/2 bath house with lots of space). However, my aunt is out of town and agreed to let them stay only if another aunt (65f), retired, stayed with them. My grandparents cannot be left alone due to my grandmother's mobility issues.

For the weekend they stayed at our small cottage (2 bed 1 bath), they can’t stay with us during the week because my mother's job is physically taxing and needs her own bed, and because there’s no one to watch them. 

Alongside my day job, I run an online business from 5 to 12. Last week, my in-person job unexpectedly closed for this week. I was fine with it because i knew i'd have extra time to focus on my business. 

But once my aunt found out I wasn’t working this week she changed her mind about watching them. She was supposed to cook dinner for them on Sunday but instead went out on our boat with friends. Yesterday, I heard a noise outside and found that my aunt had dropped off my grandparents without notifying me. I found my grandmother in our driveway seconds from falling onto power tools. If I wasn’t there she would have been seriously hurt. After I made sure she was safe, I left to find my aunt and ask her to come get them. She was sunbathing.

I feel like I've done enough for them and I need to focus on my own life. They have 7 kids and 22 grandkids that can watch them besides me. They've taken advantage of my kindness in the past (i never got paid for the work I did with my grandfather or for being their caretaker) and I'm done. 

The next day, I parked my car at the end of our long driveway to deter my aunt from dropping them off. My aunt blew up at me for this and came to my house screaming at me. She also asked if my grandparents could stay at my mother’s house from Weds to Fri, because she needed to drive 4 hours home for some documents she 'forgot' to bring with her. 

I declined, explaining that although I work from home, I can’t supervise my grandparents. I told her it was unfair to place this responsibility on me, and that if she’s going to commit to looking after them then she needs to take on all of the responsibilities associated. Especially since I'm not their child, just their grandchild. I suggested she take them with her if she really needed to go.

She exploded at me, claiming I was making my grandparents feel unwelcome and tried to contact my boss's wife. Fortunately, my boss’s wife agrees with my stance. My aunt has since taken them with her to retrieve her documents.

For context: My roomie Ally (fake name) and I have been roommates since freshman year of college as undergrad students. We chatted online and got assigned to the same room. Ever since then we have been very close and decided to stay roommates even when neither of us wanted to live on campus anymore after our freshman year, our school requires freshman to stay on campus. Ally was coming from Boston to attend. We go to a well ranked school on the west coast, it's not an ivy league but it would be ignorant of me to not call it prestigious. Ever since I've met Ally has told everyone that her family all attended Harvard University, and that she was going to transfer after her freshman year but ""hated the weather in Boston"". She went as far to show us pictures of her sister and parents who attended Harvard dressed in Harvard merchandise. I say ""Went as far"" because I later found out that the photos Ally was showing me and our friends were out of context and not even of her sister. I only started to doubt her claims after last winter break when I went over to her family's home for Christmas back in Boston, but I never intended to confront her directly.

Long story short, I found what I thought was Ally's sister's social media and she was a Harvard Influencer the weekend of a Frat party. I'm not in a sorority but Ally is and we went with a few girls and the sorority pres. Basically, Ally was bragging about Harvard per usual when I mentioned her sister's Social Media to carry on the conversation and showed it to the group when they asked for it. We talked about how Ally wasn't in any of the photos and I mentioned how Ally told me before that her family doesn't talk to her sister, and someone mentioned how Ally says she stays with her sister every summer to go to the Cambridge campus for internships. I had never heard this before and mentioned how her parents told me that they are grateful that she comes home every summer. Ally then starts freaking out at me and calling me all sorts of things and we end up getting kicked out of the party. We are all standing on the sidewalk and figuring out how to get home when the sorority pres who had wandered off earlier came out and berated Ally and said to meet her first thing in the morning. I went home and Ally went to a friend's house since she didn't want to ride with me.

Ally then came back to our apartment this morning to pick up her things. She got angry at me again and said I caused her to get kicked out of her sorority and all of her friends think that she's a liar now. I told her that she made it look like she had something to hide with her reaction and I was just having a conversation and didn't even accuse her of anything. I don't think it's my fault Ally got kicked out of her sorority, since she's had issues in the past. But I feel like accidentally implying she wasn't being truthful puts me in AH territory. AITA?

Teeny update: The influencer I mentioned made a video a while ago saying that she was adopted and an only child. So confirmed it is not Ally's sister.

34,1fjyupv,AITA for telling my grandparents to stop showing up to my art classes and viewings?,"I (17M) have been in art classes since I was 5. My grandparents never really showed up before. Not to any art viewings (started taking part in them at 8) or to classes to pick me up. But for a few months now they have. And they show for a reason.

My parents got divorced last year. Dad had an affair, knocked up another woman. I went no contact over it. I don't care that he didn't cheat on me. I don't want to be around him anymore. I don't like what he did. I don't like what he said to mom; he told her in front of me that his affair partner gave him a daughter, my mom had my stillborn sister when I was 9 so what he said to her was awful. My dad tried to talk me into forgiving him and seeing it as a blessing that I'd get the baby sister I always wanted. I told him I will never consider that baby my sister. That she's innocent but she will never ever be a person I love and I will never want to change that. I told him nobody could replace my actual baby sister. I told him he made an affair baby and he can complain about her innocence all he likes but he can blame himself for her not getting the family he wants her to.

When my mom got custody of me I blocked my dad. I do not speak to him.

My grandparents didn't like the hard line I drew. They asked me to reconsider. They asked me to meet the baby. They wanted me to be open to therapy with my dad and maybe to see him (and the baby) at their house. I said no. They told me if I draw this hard line I'll never show up to their house for Christmas because they'll be there. I said yeah. This was the starting point of them showing up to my art classes and art viewings (we do them once every two months, and it's not a huge thing, just letting family and friends check out our work). They always have the baby with them. They try to make me interact with her. I've seen her because of this. My feelings have not changed. I'm in therapy, so is mom. Therapy has not made me more open. Even though she's biologically my half sister I don't love or want her and do not want to know her. I'm tired of my grandparents showing up. I reported my grandparents to class organizer who no longer lets them come in but they still wait outside. They try to get me to talk to them. And I saw them again yesterday and I had enough and told them to stop showing up to this stuff because they won't be let in and I won't acknowledge them anymore.

35,1fjyn1l,WIBTA if I didn't do what my mother promised to someone on my behalf?,"Context: I (39F)'m low contact with my family. I'm an artist - not famous, but I have some recognition in my field. My family were not very supportive of my career choice until I started becoming successful and other people praised me.

So I'm a bit sour now that my mother (63F) is trying to get involved in my career, especially because she does things behind my back that I don't approve of. E.g., I gave her some free prints of my work, thinking she wanted to give them to friends. A few months later she asked me if I had more, because she'd already sold the ones she'd got. I was mortified because these were free prints: I got them for free to give away (and she knew that) and I gave them to her for free and she decided to make money off them. So obviously I didn't give her more prints.

Now, she has apparently promised someone a print signed by me. And she told me this (on the phone): she knows I’m going to be mad but she already did it, so I need to sign a print and send it to them. So I ask her why she did it when she knew it would upset me. Her response: I wasn't thinking.

This has been her response to anything I've called her out on for years. She never apologises, she just says it's not her fault that she did something without thinking about it, and she then blames me for being angry, because it hurts her. Also she's not senile, but she keeps forgetting when I ask her not to do something (this is not the first time she went behind my back and did sth like this).

I wasn't buying her excuse and she told me that she hadn't actually promised it to the person 100%, she'd just said she could probably get it for them. She ended up crying, so I caved in and said that while I'm not giving her another free print, if she can buy one and get it to me (I live in a different city), I'll sign it for them.

However, the exchange between my mother and that person was on facebook on a public post. And I found it. And she lied to me. The person (who knows she's my mother) asks if there's a chance I might sign the print and my mother replies: ""Sure :)"" So she actually did promise it without asking me if it was okay.

So I got upset again. Just to be clear, I don't have an issue with signing that print for someone, I'd do it if I was normally asked. It just really bothers me that to my mother I don't seem to deserve any consideration. So I'm conflicted, because I know what she’s doing is emotional manipulation and I don't want to give in, but also that person who asked for a signature did it in good faith and was promised something I don't mind giving.

EDIT: Please read the last sentence of my post, that's where my dilemma lies. I don't normally give in to my mother. This is the one time I'm considering it, because it's minor and I believe the person who asked for the signature meant well and wasn't aware my mother was promising it without my knowledge.

We are supposed to visit my mother in law (MIL) for Christmas. We've been talking about this trip since last spring and I've said a couple of times that I want 2 separate hotel rooms due to Jake's snoring. We haven't slept in the same bed for over 5 years. For a while, as long as he didn't drink or smoke and wasn't sick, Jake wouldn't snore but he generally wasn't willing to stick to that for more than a day or two at a time. He's slowly gained more and more weight, so now he snores no matter what, but drinking/smoking makes it go from loud to deafening. Well... Jake didn't book 2 hotel rooms. Instead, Jake booked a suite with 2 bed rooms, but there are no doors (its a nice but quirky hotel we've stayed at before.) Jake has a habit of forgetting/delaying things like this and then, at the last moment, he basically twists himself into knots trying to make everyone happy. In reality making no one happy but everyone feels bad for him because he tried to hard so we all just go along with him. Jake's current solutions are he and 1-3 of the kids would stay with his mother and I could stay in the suite, or they would go without me. Neither of these are acceptable to me. I want to be with my family for Christmas, and I don't see the point in going on vacation but not being together. Jake is pissed at me because he and his mother have talked about booking the suite instead of the 2 rooms while I was in the room, but I wasn't paying attention because I wasn't really involved in the conversation. There are also a couple of other issues which are making me less than enthusiastic about this whole trip.

So I naturally get a bit angry and ask them what’s wrong with them, and they then were giggling and laughing at me, so when they walked by, I saw they were heading into their form room right next to where I was at the time, so I followed them in, and told their form tutor.

49,1fjuacw,AITA for asking my fiancé to not turn on the loudest cat toys while I am trying to sleep?,"We have 2 cats that are very high energy (a Bengal & a Savannah cat), so I try to keep them entertained and engaged throughout the day with interactive cat toys. This means I have quite a few of them around, and some of them can be quite loud. 

My (33f) fiancé (34m) turned on one of these cat toys while I was still in bed and sleeping. The thing is, he chose to turn on the toy that zooms around & runs into things & is generally the loudest toy they have. I was still in bed, had not gotten up yet, and got woken up to the toy running into things and being loud. I get I only had about 20 more minutes in bed, but I didn’t sleep great and was happy to have that extra time until I heard the cat toy running into things and got fully woken up (I wake up to his alarm & then continue to sleep for about another half hour) When I came out of the bedroom, I asked what I was hearing and he said he turned the toy on because the cat was pawing at it (we really spoil our cats & I get that’s what he was doing - but why the loudest toy?) At first I said “Oh, Ok.” and proceeded to do all the morning choirs that only I do (feed all of the  animals on our acreage, clean up the litter, give our old dog his morning pills to deal with arthritis, uncover the garden as it frosted last night, etc.) 

Once the choirs were just about done, I asked him “Next time can you please turn on a toy that doesn’t run around and bonk into walls while I am still trying to sleep?” His response was “Yup I got it, won’t be doing that again. You could have just gotten up and asked nicely instead of getting all grumpy” and I responded with “Well I thought that was pretty Rude for you to do”. Then he left for work. 

Most of the time when he does things like this, I don’t say anything cause I don’t wanna stir the pot - but to me that was once again quite inconsiderate & I don’t think I was over reacting. I was just trying to express irritation while still communicating that I didn’t appreciate that and ask for a different route to be taken in the future - but now I’m starting to feel guilty like maybe I was overreacting or mean?

My wife makes less money than me and is the type of people who prefers to make her own gifts for people. The issue is she will do this even if the person doesn't want this.I will use myself as an example. For the past few years she has made every single gift I have been given.

No matter what I asked for I get a homemade gift, doesn't matter if it is cheap or not. Last Christmas I asked for a new a few things and I got a homemade scarf. I always get her stuff she want. I have talked to her about this multiple time.


My birthday was yesterday and I asked her to give me a book. It was only 25 dollars and I sent her the link. I opened the gift and she made some homemade bookmarks. It wasn't even the type oof bookmarks I like. They were made from fabric and I like the wooden ones. 

I must have made a face because she asked what was wrong. I told her I didn't want these. I made it so clear what I actually wanted and I have talked to her so many times. I handed them back and went out to buy the book.

We had a big fight when I got back, she claims I am being ungrateful and a jerk.

53,1fju0b2,AITA for expecting my tv to be replaced?,"A couple of months ago I had decided to buy myself a new tv. I bought an Sony OLED so it was pretty expensive. As I know how easily screens can get damaged I told my gf to leave the cleaning of the screen to me as we each do specific chores and my girlfriend cleans the living room. 

This was going fine for a few weeks until my girlfriend decided to clean the tv. She sprayed some cleaning product on it and wiped it down. When I put the tv on it was unwatchable. It is under warranty but that doesn't cover replacement if you've damaged the tv yourself. 

I asked my girlfriend why she sprayed anything on it when she knew I clean the tv. She said she was in the living room anyway so just thought she'd clean it. I told her I expect her to replace the tv. 

She refused and said it was an accident but I pointed out just because it was an accident, it doesn't mean she's not responsible. I mentioned if you accidentally crash into someone elses car you're still liable for the damages. 

She said it was expensive and she doesn't want to spend a chunk of her savings on it but I just repeated to her that she's responsible for replacing it. She said I was unreasonable as she didn't mean to.

54,1fjtjk3,AITA for refusing to do housework?,"For some background, I (22F), finished my degree at the end of last year. I was unemployed for around eight months, and in that time, I did all the cooking and cleaning for my family, since I wasn't working or studying.

The problem comes in now. I started a new job (my first job) around a month and a half ago. It's full-time, and remote, so I work from home five days a week.

Around 30 percent of what I earn goes to rent. What my parents (both 49 M and F) do with that money, I don't know or care. This was an agreement we made before I even entered university (my father paid for my degree). The agreement was that as long as I was studying, I wouldn't have to pay rent. Understandable.

Now that I'm working, I don't have as much free time to help around the house as before.

My mother has started complaining about this. She says now all this falls on her.

The issue is I have two younger brothers (17M, twins). They do NOTHING in terms of housework or cooking.

My mother believes that, since they're in high school and since I'm a girl, I should still be doing the same amount of domestic labour as I used to do (when I was unemployed). I told her I realistically don't have the time, especially right now (I'm on a three-month probation period, so I'm working harder than I think I usually would)

I still make sure the common areas are tidy, the family washing is done, and the kitchen is kept clean. The only room I still keep as clean and on top of is my bedroom (which is also my office). I also still keep up with all chores regarding the family dog

My mother states that the amount of money I'm providing in rent doesn't cover all my expenses, so I should be doing more to help out (which is a separate conversation). I think that that's not true, since the amount I give in the month is more than enough to hire someone (even two people) to do the domestic work that needs to be done

And for reference, I used to spend a few hours every day cleaning, ironing, washing, etc. I realistically don't have that kind of time available anymore. We had this same argument when I was in university (I was on campus for 6 to 8 hours everyday, and I spent another 2 to 3 hours travelling)

So AITA for refusing to do the same amount of housework as I used to?

  
Edit to add - we don't live in America, or any European country, but the city I'm living in is too expensive to move out at the moment. Also, in my culture, it's not the norm for children to move out as soon as they turn 18, or even 21.

56,1fjt8ae,AITA For Not Also Babysitting My Brother’s Friend’s Kids While On Vacation?,"I(F21) recently went on vacation with my brother(M34), his family, friends and a few of their siblings. A lot of us grew up together so vacations like this weren’t uncommon but this is the first one where everyone’s kids were also coming along. My brother offered to pay for my whole vacation rather than the half he usually paid if I was willing to help with the kids(M7 & F4) for a day or 2 so he and his wife, Rose, could get some alone time. I agreed since they’re good kids and I help out anytime I’m in the vicinity anyways as it’s not uncommon for our culture.

On the first night’s dinner, one of my brother’s friend’s girlfriends, Ally, made an offhand comment about my brother having a vacation nanny while she was fussing with her kid while I was talking to Rose about their plans tomorrow when she mentioned the kids just staying the night in my room so that they didn’t have to wake us up early to leave for their appointment. I agreed since I was watching them tonight anyways.

I assume the problem started there since Ally showed up at my door after dinner trying to drop her kid off. I was fine with until she told him she would be seeing him tomorrow and conversation after went like this:

Me: I don’t mind him being here for a few hours but he can’t spend the night.
Her: But they’re spending the night?
Me: Yes.
Her: So why can’t he?
Me: Well there’s no room for him and they’re my brother’s kids and are used to spending the night with me.

We went back and forth a few times, eventually I just refused overall and apologized to the kid. I’ve been told a few storied and Ally is the type to just leave her kid anyways, regardless of the conversation and I didn’t feel like tracking her down later.

While we were at the pool a few days later, I took the kids to the resort cafe for ice cream and offered to take the other kids, a few of the parents said no and some of them gave me a weird look so I asked my friend about it. Apparently at the breakfast the second day, Ally complained about what I did, and a few of them took her side.

There were similar situations and eventually my brother stepped in to say that he paid for my vacation which is why I took a few days to help him and that they could chip in if they wanted my help but I talked to my mom and a few of my friends and they pointed out that my brother actually got to enjoy his vacation unlike the others and I could’ve taken or offering to take the other kids when I was watching my Niece and Nephew.",0.0,0.0479081347584724,0,1
57,1fjsojq,AITA for flaking out on my friend at a party— even though I had already arrived at the party? ,"I'd like to preface this by saying I (22, NB) am severely autistic. My friend Jason (21M) knows that. He also knows that, because of my autism, I am not too fond of most parties— I *like* parties, but with the right type of people, in smaller environments, with ""breathing"" areas without music that's too loud, good places to talk rather than dance if you so wish. I actually love these parties! Especially if they're early on in the evening; I hate leaving the house after 9. 

Despite explaining this to Jason many times, however, he *always* tries to drag me into raves. Almost every week he tells me about a rave that's going on and begs me to come with. He begs and pleads and sends me sad memes and whatnot, but I usually don't budge. Last week, however, he invited for Emo night at a club with a nice open terrace. I had D&D that night, but sure, it seemed fun so I went after D&D and it was great! Despite the time, I found the party ticked everything I like in parties. Jason kept telling me ""see how fun it actually is once you actually go out?"" and I kept telling him ""yeah! Like, you see, this is the shit I like. Invite me to more of *this* type and I'll come every time"".

Just a few days later— Jason invites me to another party. He says it's a little college party to celebrate the start of the new semester. I'm like... sure ig! Last time was fun, I think I communicated my issues clearly, whatever. He was also coming to my place the next day. 

As I start approaching the party, I notice that *everyone* in the metro is going to that party. Mostly people who do NOT mash with me and my style at all, but sure, I won't judge a book by its cover. I get to the party and... it's not a *little college party*. It's his University's start of the semester event. Almost *ten thousand people crowded into a concert/rave venue*. Worst part: The line to ENTER the party was over two hours long, my friend's phone was turned off, and he had entered already. This was around 10 PM. It means I'd be until midnight by myself standing on a line to a party I wouldn't enjoy and have to look for my friend without communication. I simply sent him a text saying I was going home, and when he saw it once his phone was on— just shortly after I decided to leave— he got *mad*. He's not even coming over today like we planned. He told me to cut the line and to come anyways but I was already in the station waiting for the metro back home. He's been extremely short in all his replies.

Was I too harsh? I was there already, I could have staid and tried to have fun. My family says I completely over reacted and I should have been ""opened to new experiences"". AITA?

58,1fjshly,AITA for telling my friend she needs to get a grip and be more responsible with her finances?,"This situation is about me (f22) and my friend ""Ava"" (f22). I've known Ava since we were 12. We've always been pretty close although we did drift apart when we both went to uni.

Ava and I both grew up working class, raised by single mothers. We mainly did activities together that didn't involve spending money.

She is still in university and is always complaining about not having any money. She receives student loans and works part-time. Out of our entire friend circle, Ava spends the most money and goes out the most, usually hitting bars or clubs at least twice a week. A lot of her income goes towards drinking, cigarettes and going to events.

I like spending time with Ava but I wish she would be more responsible.

Ava had previously asked me to buy things for her (all small things but it adds up) and she would transfer me the money. She did transfer me the money straight away to begin with but eventually she started ""forgetting"" and wouldn't give me the money. I eventually just stopped buying the items for her.

I'm still living with my mum who is doing a lot better financially now than she was when I was a kid. Back then, my mum was working in retail, we had no car and lived off cheap canned or boxed food. I know there were people worse off than us but we were by no means wealthy. She now has a well-paying job, a car and a mortgage on a nice house.

Ava keeps making comments that my family is ""rich now"" and apparently made some comments to people behind my back that I've been stingy by asking her to transfer me the money for the things Ive bought for her.

This eventually led up to a small disagreement between us because our friend circle planned a day out. When it was time to buy our train tickets, Ava kept looking at me awkwardly. She eventually asked if I could cover her and I said no. She asked why and I said because you still owe me money from everything else. She sighed and said that if the roles were reversed she would've paid for me. Ava paid for her ticket but the atmosphere was very awkward afterwards and she kept saying that her bank account is going to be in the negatives (but continued to buy sweets and drinks).

Towards the end of the day I eventually snapped at Ava and told her it's not my or anyone elses fault she can't stop herself from spending all her income and that she really needs to get a grip. Ava raised her voice at me and said that I'm self-centered and victimising myself.

59,1fjsdct,AITA for buying a guitar with my Boyfriends Credit Card ,"I (23F ) and my Boyfriend, (27M )I’ll call mark.
We have been together for 3 years now and I decided I wanted to get my boyfriend a gift. Our anniversary is coming up and I wanted to do something really nice for him. He is a guitarist and has been wanting this one particular guitar ( Jackson King V series Pro). He talks about it and said he’d love to own one. So I have alway heard that the best gift is something that someone wants but will never get for themselves.


 I was at a guitar store looking for a gift or something and then I saw it. It was a Jackson King V series Pro. It was not exactly the one he always showed me, but it was close enough. It had the weird part where the strings attach with that little lever thingy and the bottom of the guitar is all spiked (sorry I don’t know guitars). I knew he wanted it so I thought I would surprise him. We are by no means rich but we live comfortably so I didn’t think he’d mind paying 2400. 

I ended up buying him the guitar, I did use his credit card, which in hindsight I guess wasn’t a good idea. I just figured it won’t matter since he never makes me pay for anything. I figured it would be an okay gift. I took it out of the case  it came with and propped it up in the living room. And waiting for Mark to get home, we

When he came in I hugged him kissed him and told him “happy anniversary, I got you something special”. He went into the living room and just about jumped through the roof with excitement. He instantly started thanking me and telling me all about how special this particular guitar was in comparison to the regular king V. And I just said “what can I say … I have good taste” , and we talked and then it happened. 

“How much did you end up paying for this thing ? “ mark asked, and I nonchalantly answered “it was like 2500 bucks , but I don’t think we will have a problem paying it off “. Then he just stared , and asked me what I was talking about. I proceeded to explain how I wanted to do something nice but 2400 buck was a bit much upfront so I put it on his credit card and I figured we’d pay it off together. 

Mark is not an angry person, but he was more angry than I ever imagined he could be. He just started yelling at me. I know I messed up but , he could at least be a bit grateful, that someone cares as much as I do right ? But he ended up bringing it back to the guitar store but I guess they can’t return it cuz it was on a cc or something I don’t remember. When he got home , I thought he’d be in a better mood but he didn’t end up coming home until til late and then when he did he just went straight to bed. This was 2 days ago and he still hasn’t spoken to me 



UPDATE :

So thank you for everyone for comments, even if some of you were a bit harsh. I can now see perfectly clearly how extremely foolish I had been  I’d like to address something I mistakenly said, as well as an update on events of the last few days.
For starters 
 I didn’t not buy a pro series king V, 
the guitar I actually purchased was a “JACKSON KING V SELECT SERIES KV2” and it was used in case you were wondering 


So mark has been staying with his mom for the last acouple days and we finally had a chance to sit down and work this out. We went to a small pizza place to eat and talk ( I paid hehe). He explained why he was upset and basically everything you guys said. I apologize and we began to figure out what is gonna happen next. I took some advice from here and I took a few of my expensive clothes to a designer clothes store called “Future Fashion” and got them looked at to see if they’d be worth anything. I have some supreme stuff ( just like a hoodie and a few stickers ) that I got for my birthday last year, as well as a a couple designer belts ( Gucci &  Versace ), and 1 Prada handbag. 

Before any of you comment none of these things were gifts from my boyfriend, they are gifts from my parents ( supreme) and the belts and hand bag are from a shopping spree my mom took me on before I started college (URI). They gave me $375 for the supreme hoodie (didn’t want the stickers smh) I got a $850 for the belts and he wouldn’t take the Prada bag since “it’s not there specialty” but I am going to take to few other places tomorrow but they said I should be able to get like $900 for the bag so…

I told my boyfriend that this was my plan  and right now counting money from my savings account($500) (literally cleaned me out hahaha) and the stuff I sold I have 1750 and the potential $900 for the bag should be according to my math $2,625 ( which means I’ll still have some left over to buy him a “real “ gift ) I told mark and he was glad and he is going to be taking the money to pay off a chunk so that we don’t get interest or whatever (idk how that works tbh) 

As far as our relationship goes , things will be okay. Mark has calmed down , and just wants 3 things to happen. First I’m not allowed to use his card without permission (which most of you predicted), secondly I need to show that I fully understand my actions, and 3 pay him back. 

He basically told me as long as those conditions are met then things will return to normal. He does really like the guitar (which he admitted in a silly way to try and lighten the mood at the end of talk)
And he does appreciate the thought of it but like you all have said what I did was wrong and I will never let it happen again and I’m gonna fix it .",Asshole,2024-09-18,"AITA for buying a guitar with my Boyfriends Credit Card  I (23F ) and my Boyfriend, (27M )I’ll call mark.

So Christmas.

63,1fjrgeq,AITA for buying a Steam Deck when my mother has to pawn her jewelry to pay the light bill?,"Throwaway

I'll try to keep this brief. I (21) live at home because rent is insane right now. I work a minimum wage job. When I get paid (every 2 weeks) I give my mother (45F) all but $50 from my check. I use that little money I have to pay my phone bill and small things I need throughout the month. I really wanted a steam deck since highschool so I've been cutting back on some things.

Maybe like 1 or something. 3 at most. But he's in all my early memories. He was always eager to tell me I wasn't his kid too. And mom was quick to tell me to shut up if I got sad he wasn't including me because she said she didn't want her biggest mistake (me) costing her the most important person in her life (him). My moms parents are the only actual extended bio family I know and they hate me. Not sure why. I always felt it. Guess it's my fault I was born.

Her husband's family never include me, leave me out of all things ""family"" related. I don't get gifts for Christmas or birthdays, I'm not called a grandson, nephew or cousin. They never show up for my birthdays or anything or invite me to the birthday parties. If my ""parents"" are invited then I'm there but I'm not allowed to play with the other kids. My half siblings are allowed to even with the much older kids.

I have four half siblings ages 12, 10, 8 and 5. They are treated so differently to me. And they treat me like shit just like the rest of the ""family"". I tried really hard to be close to them for years. I hoped someone would love me back. But they repeat the stuff they hear their dad or someone else in their family say about me not being family. They said just because my dad didn't want me doesn't mean they need to (something both my mom and their dad have said). They even say mom wishes she didn't have me. Even when they were starting to say that stuff I'd help with them or help them directly because I just wanted someone, you know. But they were always saying I wasn't their real brother.

They have dropped me off at friends houses and left me way later than I was supposed to be there. Which caused issues with friends parents who'd ring my mom or her husband and I'd hear fights about being stuck with me. A few times mom tried to get people to take me overnight or for the whole weekend. Then I was a burden to these other families. It sucked. I always had so much anxiety around going to a party or something for that reason and when I was younger a lot of parents stopped letting their kids invite me to parties because I was the kid nobody ever came back for.

It's been maybe 5 months of me just focusing on me (working, saving, looking at ways for me to move out once I'm 18) and not helping them and now I'm getting shit for that. We were at my mom's ILs house and they were complaining that I didn't offer to plate food for the 5 year old or offer to walk the 10 year old to the store for stuff she wanted.

67,1fjqy0f,AITA for not buying cheese and yogurt for my non-vegan boyfriend? ,"My bf (27M) and I (26F) met 6 years ago when I moved to his country. We moved in together a few months ago into my rented apartment and he now pays half.

I'm vegan, he's not, but he does eat many meat alternatives since it is normal here. When we go out to eat he will order if its the only protein heavy option because he goes to the gym a lot. When we were leaving separately and we were eating at my house I always made sure to make a vegan meal with tons of protein and when we ate at his he made sure I had vegan meals. It's always worked well for us.

When we decided to move in together he told me that he would stop eating meat at home out of respect for me because he knows it grosses me out and wouldn't want to have it in my fridge (he still eats it when he's out sometimes) . This was honestly something I was worried about but him saying that before I could even tell him made me super happy. He said he still wanted to have dairy and eggs and I was fine with that. I am the one that does the grocery shopping, and althought buying dairy and eggs feels very wrong to me I understand that he's making some sacrifices so I will buy it for him (he pays this part of the groceries, I pay my ""special"" part and we have a joint budget for general stuff).

Problem started a few months ago when I got him yogurt and cheese from a different grocery store (I go to 2-3 different ones during the week and forgot to get his stuff the previous day) and he said he hated that brand and ended up going bad. I HATE animal products going to waste (or any food for that matter, which is why I do 2/3 shopping trips/week) so I was pretty upset about that. I made sure to buy it at the same grocery store he's used to and that lasted for some weeks until he told me that it's not good anymore (they changed providers).

Now we've been playing this stupid game where I have to buy different brands until he finds the one that he likes. And I understand that, because I'm very particular about my food too, but he eats tons of cheeses, yogurts and other dairy stuff and for now he just has a safe brand of greek yogurt and cottage cheese. Every week I get him what he asks for from a different grocery store and it goes uneaten most times (specifically the cheeses). Which means he's buying more eggs to substitute that which is fine because he pays for it but the amount of animal products we are buying is increasing just because it gets thrown out.

Again, I understand this because I have my ""safe"" brands too but I am the one that has been visiting more grocery stores than ever so I just decided to stop buying them until he decides what he wants. He also refuses to get a name brand because it's a waste of money.

While catching up with a friend on the Friday, another friend from university says he's free on Saturday and will come up to see us. My friend says I can stay on his sofa another night. As I haven't seen this other friend in nearly two years I agree.

I message my girlfriend and mention to her what has happened and that we'll have to rearrange the meal for Sunday instead. She gets annoyed and says I shouldn't be cancelling on her. 

I mention that I'm rearranging, not cancelling and it's only because something has come up and I haven't seen my friend in a long time.

She says she doesn't want to go out on Sunday so I say we'll just have to go next weekend then. She says no and that I'm wrong for not saying no to my friends and coming home.

However, he had always had a softer corner for my sister since they shared a lot of common interests. Growing up, I pined for his attention and his love and never really got it. As I became an adult, I stopped trying, and became my own person. 

I was a*saulted by a cousin when I was 8 years old, and I only opened up to him when I was 19. However, he did nothing, and continues to be in touch with my assaulter's family. I had expected him to stand up for me and get me justice, or at least confront him, and the family. Yet, he did nothing about it. And instead told me to get over it, and move on. He also barely made any effort to understand my mental health situation. 

Four years back, my mother got diagnosed with cancer. And we were the only two people caring for my mother. During that time, we began to bond a little more. There's years ago, I attempted to take my own life, and that's when he started to understand how much I had been struggling. Since then, he has been trying to be there for me.

This whole thing wasn't really planned together from the start but just fell into place because we both randomly wanted to go to India around the same time and were like.. might as well eh? Little reunion at the other end of the world would be super awesome!

I knew that we'd be on a slightly different budget since you really don't earn a lot down there compared to Europe - which is totally fine for me, since I'm also not a big spender. Typical backpacker, ~20$/day, try to save money wherever possible while still having a good time.

Now it turns out that he saved a little less cash for those 2 months than I thought/would be necessary, which not too dramatic per se but here is the issue: since he shouldn't spend so much on domestic flights, he wants to take trains only to get from A to B. Which I don't mind when it comes to ""short"" distances of <12 hours, I know the scenery can be stunning and they are just part of the authentic India experience. 

BUT we have to get from the southcoast all the way up to Rishikesh in November. This is a 2 day train ride vs a 2 hour flight and I just CAN'T. India will be my 98th country and I've been on a lot of adventures but meanwhile I know my limits and I know this will be torture for me (esp. since I had to get sober 1.5 years ago and unfortunately my window of tolerance is still a little narrow from time to time).

I dont know if I'm being a p*ssy for this but I put my body and mind through so much stressful and crazy shit during this past decade of traveling the globe in a drunken stupor, I just like to take it easy and look out for my wellbeing. Be well. Relax. 

So, would it be mean to tell him to go hit the eastcoast and then take the 2 day train ride by himself while I just stay at the beach a little longer anf then take a plane to get to the next destination - and we just meet there?

We only have 2 microwaves at work for a couple hundred employees so for those that bring their own lunch it can get pretty busy, especially on days that there are a lot of people in the office. People have this habit of putting multiple food items in the microwave from different people, so if there is space while you are using the microwave, it’s common for someone to approach you and say “hey, I can I put my stuff in the microwave together with yours?”

This drives me absolutely crazy, because from my understanding of how a microwave works, it can’t magically output more that it’s max power (1000 Watts for our microwaves I think) and so if you put 0.5L of food in the microwave and heat it at max power, 1000 Watts, and it takes 2 minutes to get hot, if we double the food amount to 1L it will take 4 minutes. If me and you do this in series, one after the other, I have to wait 2 minutes, then you go after, you have to wait 4 minutes (2 mins for my food, 2 mins for yours), so total wait time is 6 mins. If we do it in parallel, we both have to wait 4 minutes, so total wait time is 8 minutes. This doesn’t affect your wait time as the person adding food, but it does affect mine as the person initially using the microwave!

If I just say no without explaining, I seem like a grumpy asshole, if I explain myself, I seem like a know it all. It’s at the point where I’m more reluctant to even use the microwaves, because I don’t want people to think I’m a dick for not wanting to share.

Sarah and Liv were BFFs growing up. Always together. Shared everything. The whole TV trope of close sisters. That was my sisters. The other part that was very TV like was their anti-boy rhetoric and specifically, anti-brother. They never liked me being near them and they'd always say I was embarrassing to them, that I was gross (which I wasn't dirty or anything), that they wanted sisters and not brothers, that boys weren't allowed to play whatever games they were playing. It hurt my feelings as a kid and they were punished for being cruel on occasion. Not all the time. But it happened a few times and I know our parents got concerned enough to try therapy. Both individual for us all and family therapy together. It was in family therapy when my sisters loudly proclaimed they would never love me or want a brother. They said boys are disgusting and nobody wants them and they wanted someone to come and take me away forever so they never had to see me again.

My parents put a lot of focus into giving me outside focuses too, so the stuff with my sisters wouldn't destroy me. It wasn't always perfect. I did wish at a younger age that my sisters would care. But I had friends, hobbies, activities and stuff to keep me distracted and my parents kept working on my sisters treatment of me. Because it went beyond just not being close.

Their attitude toward me did not change. I was very much in the not-family camp when Sarah got married and when Sarah and then Liv started having babies. I was not included or invited to anything even to meet their kids when they were born. I was not sent any announcements. My parents and other family got those. I'm not even their social media friend/follower (they both have accounts set to permission needed to follow).

I'm truly over it/them by now. I know nothing will change and honestly I don't want to and fuck the whole ""don't hold kids actions against them"" because they have not been kids for years.

Now they have some kids that are a bit older and both sisters want to work. They tried to share a nanny and babysitter but I guess they got tired of paying for both for different occasions. So they approached me to be a babysitter. They told me I should help take care of their kids since I'm supposed to be family ""or whatever"". I asked if they were serious and then I rolled my eyes at them hard. They said I had a shitty attitude. I told them they can take care of their own fucking kids and they won't be using me after 24 years of wanting my existence to go away. They accused me of being as bad as them for responding in the way that I did.

I was not included or invited to anything even to meet their kids when they were born. I was not sent any announcements. My parents and other family got those. I'm not even their social media friend/follower (they both have accounts set to permission needed to follow).

I'm truly over it/them by now. I know nothing will change and honestly I don't want to and fuck the whole ""don't hold kids actions against them"" because they have not been kids for years.

Now they have some kids that are a bit older and both sisters want to work. They tried to share a nanny and babysitter but I guess they got tired of paying for both for different occasions. So they approached me to be a babysitter. They told me I should help take care of their kids since I'm supposed to be family ""or whatever"". I asked if they were serious and then I rolled my eyes at them hard. They said I had a shitty attitude. I told them they can take care of their own fucking kids and they won't be using me after 24 years of wanting my existence to go away. They accused me of being as bad as them for responding in the way that I did.

80,1fjnqn8,AITA for not paying all of my boyfriend's laptop,"For some context, my boyfriend and I are long-distance and live 3.5 hours away from each other by plane. I started my first job a few months ago, he’s still studying and is struggling to find a part-time job.

We got into an argument about a week ago (it was about him blocking me on tiktok), after which he apologized, but he became extremely closed off the days after. He barely texted me, stopped calling me, etc. He told me our argument made him feel depressed and lonely (he actually has a history of mental health struggles).

I kept checking in, letting him know I’m here for him and that I care about him (despite still feeling hurt over how he handled the argument honestly). I asked him a few times to call or play some video games with me but he said his energy was low and that he didn’t want to. He told me he wasn’t eating much which worried me, so I offered to order him food, which he didn’t want to. I assured him that I’m here if he needs me.

One evening he was a bit more responsive again so we texted a bit and he expressed once more how lonely he was, that his classes are starting again next week but he’s probably gonna fail some classes because he currently doesn’t own a laptop, and how sad he is that nobody is there for him and helping him pull through. I told him that we should focus on getting him the laptop if that would make him feel better. I did some research and sent him links to some suitable laptops (also some nice secondhand ones around his neighborhood) and told him I’d help paying for it. He declined my help and said the specs of those laptops weren’t good enough anyway.

After a while he sent me a link from Amazon to one that was more expensive, again I offered to help pay for it but he rejected, saying it’s too late anyway because he is borrowing money from a friend. He made some comments like “it’s interesting to see who will actually pull through for me”. So that’s when I figured that the problem is that I didn’t pay for all of his laptop and only offered to pay half. But he doesn't really express things easily, I usually have to fish for it or read between the lines.

He continued with “I don’t like it that you like seeing me in pain and do nothing about it”, “you need to be more selfless”, and then he gave me a list of the things I’m doing wrong and what I should be doing instead. I reminded him that I bought him new earbuds for Christmas and paid half of his new phone a few months ago but its as if he is so hurt that he will just not acknowledge anything I do. I asked him if my mental support is useless too, to which he says that he appreciates my encouragement and affection, but at the same time he tells me it doesn't actually help him and ""he needs actions over words"".

81,1fjngwi,AITA for not allowing my new neighbour to use my road for access.,"Hello Reddit!

In my country, there is a saying - ""if you want to live in the forest, you have to buy the forest!"".

So we did, Me and my husband's life dream was to live somewhere private, and a few years ago we finally did it! COVID made home office possible, so there was no reason to live in the city anymore! So we sold our apartment and bought a nice house which was surrounded by forest.

Our closest neighbour is 400 meters away behind a grove of trees, historically there used to be a road going from front our house to the next house and the road connected 2 parallel roads both leading to the nearest town.

The house next to us has been empty for 30 years, and even before that the people who lived there used the entrance on their side as back then both roads leading to the town were gravel, so the last time the road was used as a road was even before the previous owner got the place in 60s, so nature has taken over the part that is between two houses, but the path is still passable with vehicles.

This summer, someone bought the neighbouring land with the remains of the house to build their home there, which is fine.  
One day I saw a lady driving through our driveway on the path leading to the next house, so I jumped on the ATV and followed and asked ""Why are you driving on our road?"" and the lady answered - ""Well we thought we are going to use this road because the entrance this way leads to the paved road!""

I pointed out that we have a sign ""Private road, enter only with permission!"" She replied, ""I looked it up, it used to be a public road in the 50s.""  
I told her ""Not my problem, please don't use our road!"", the government let everyone privatize many small roads in the 90s in my country, so they don't have an obligation to take care of those, so it is our private road.

I get why she is mad, the road our driveway leads into is paved, but they have to use a gravel road, and it is a \~10km drive into town. They thought they would use our driveway to access the better road.

I told her that they can't drive there and she called me an asshole for that.

We bought the place with the idea of privacy, other people using our driveway would mean no privacy.

Later I got a call from some local district office and they told me that it is not nice to deny others access to their home, and again I explained that they have access!  
They, the officials themself made the road private decades ago, and the official told me that this was not nice of me.

82,1fjn6ji,AITAH for taking my mother's side while my father has depression? ,"I (14F) started living with my mother's side of the family since last year because of my father's depression. My father's side of the family has been against it and have been trying to convince only ME to come back to the abusive house hoping my mother will follow like a fish catching a bait. 

A little context here, my mother took abuse from my father for over 20 years and left last year a few days before my birthday. But this year they tried to call be back to ""spend quality time"" with them. I knew they would try to manipulate me into thinking that my mother's side of the family is evil (everyone in her side of the family). I didn't want to because of anger. They turned a blind eye towards my father's abuse. 

Now, 3 days ago they (only grandfather and aunt) showed up unannounced trying to make ""peace"" with us but my grandfather (mother's side) started screaming at them in anger. She was angry at them for abusing her daughter. That's understandable. But although my grandfather (the mastermind behind our problems) knew about this, he didn't warn my aunt (father's side) and so she got up and said that she wanted to leave as it got worse as my grandmother started cursing at my grandfather (fs) and it only made it worse. 
And while all this was happening, I couldn't hear anything as they sente to my room and when I heard my grandmother yell, I barged out onito findy grandfather about to enter the room I was in saying that my grandmother was being ""unreasonable"" but my grandfather never cared about what my mother went through because of my father's depression and abuse. near the outside door we (mother, me, aunt and grandfather) argude, but I ended up telling my aunt everything my father did to my mother. 
She was shocked at all the things her brother did. But now, we all still believe that my father just needs help. And for the most part that is true, as he gets pressured at work, he can only take his anger out on my mother. Although I know he regrets it that doesn't mean that I am going to forgive him for what he did to my mother. And I was called an a****** for agreeing with my mother side of the family that he is wrong, most of these problems were caused by my grandfather for turning a blind eye and not raising him properly.

83,1fjn0xe,"AITA I don’t have a bond with my moms mom, mom hates me now.","I (19F) am Mexican and have never gone to Mexico. I’m a US citizen of two Mexican immigrants and two years ago got the opportunity to visit Mexico during summer. 

I was so excited because I’ve never met my grandparent before. I always grew up missing out on the grandparents memories others got to create with theirs, as a kid. So I was stoked to find out I was finally going to meet my only grandparent. I cried when I met her. I got to see the house my mom grew up in, it was a full circle moment for me. 

Time passes and my mom gets her mom (my grandma) to come stay with us for a while. The image I had painted of my bond with my grandma quickly merged into one confusing. 

She didn’t remember my name, we had no “real” conversations. I don’t speak Spanish well and the little I do, it not well said. I hurry and miss pronounced my words. I also speak in Spanlish. My grandma is full Spanish, knows no English, and heavy Mexican accented. 

She hardly understands me and I hardly understand her. When I try to talk to her she will change the topic I’m talking to her about into something that has to do with her or no necessary her but people in her life that I don’t even know. So there I sit, nodding after every word she says. Not understanding nothing but one every 5 words. 

My mom tries to force a bond between us. I’m already not social but it’s even harder when there’s nothing to go off of. My mom will tell me to sleep in the same bed as her. And I pity her because she lost her husband. I feel for her. But I just can’t force something that’s not there no matter how hard I try. 

She snores rather loudly (I can’t fall asleep unless I fall asleep first before she gets to snore), can’t sleep alone (she’s scared), has dementia so covers me up repeatedly throughout the night even if I tell her I’m burning up, because she has dementia she will also say the same phrase over and over again, she never eats (you have to beg her to eat without her wanting to make u eat instead). This doesn’t bother me as much but my mom who does look after her, does. She might not express it but it’s obvious that her mom is a little to take care of. 

My mom has even stopped working to support her mom. She’s even tried to get me to work less just to watch her mom while she tried to work again. My mom doesn’t have to keep her mom living with us but does anyway. My mom even got mad at me for living my grandma home alone for 15ish minutes because I was going to be late to work if I didn’t leave. I got to work right on time. 

I spent my whole life not knowing her and then just like magic my mom wants me to love and cherish her with all the love in the world. I don’t know my grandma. How can I love her? My mom says that she will never forgive me for not have spent more time with my grandma. My grandma leaves tomorrow. I know that it’s her mom and I should just cherish her just for that reason but I don’t know her like my mom does. How could I want to spend time with someone that I just don’t have a connection with? Am I the asshoel?

85,1fjmoor,AITA for telling my husband his daughter is embarrassing me?,"Throwaway due to personal info shared. Also changed names for privacy.

Yesterday I (30F) was chilling at home with my MIL, talking and drinking coffee. When husband (37M) arrived, he asked me if I would take his daughter (12F) shopping for a dress.

A little bit of context, when he was younger my husband had a relationship with a woman, let's call her Sarah and they had Mary their daughter. He was having his rebel phase, going against his parents with this relationship but it did not last. He realized they are way too different as individuals and broke up when Mary was 3. I met my husband 6 years ago and we got married 4 years ago. Our relationship is amazing and I get along extremely well with my in laws. I was immediately accepted into the family and my MIL treats and introduces me to people as her daughter. As you can imagine this has caused a lot of drama with Sarah because she never received the same treatment from the family but truthfully speaking she is not someone you wish to have in your social circle.

Mary and I get along good. Everyone is on the same page that she has a mother and that I am not trying to replace her, I am just her father's wife. However she spends most of her time with her mom and Sarah is teaching her extreme hippy bs like she should not abide by the expectations society has on women, she should not feel pressured to act, look or behave as what society considers acceptable and so on. Mary therefore is allowed by her mom to not shower for days in a row, wear dirty clothes, not brush her teeth or hair. This has become her way of living because she refuses to shower or dress properly all the time. It pains me to say but she could pass as a homeless child if you see her on the street due to her appearance.

Back to yesterday, 1 month from now the entire family will attend a gala where my husband will receive an award. It's an important moment in his career and he asked me if I will go with his daughter to buy a dress for the event. I told him honestly that I prefer not to. I explained that I really feel embarrassed being seen with Mary in public. She dresses horrible and most of the time her clothes are dirty, she stinks and does not brush her hair. MIL agreed and mentioned to my husband that it would be best if Mary does not attend this event because she will make us look bad in front of all the people that will be present. I was on my MIL's side. Husband was sad but he also agreed with us and mentioned he will think about it.

AITA?

Update: 

I wrote yesterday the initial post and it blew out of proportion. The number of comments was really overwhelming but I sincerely thank you for your help and all the useful comments and DMs you sent me.

I will clarify some on the most common asked questions:

1. First of all I apologize if I offended people by mentioning the hippie feminist part. I do not think that all feminists have poor hygiene and I admit it was bad wording on my part. Being a feminist is what Mary's mother uses to describe herself and justify her parenting style.
2. No, Mary is not mixed race and she and her mother are not a different ethnicity.
3. Some people found that showering for 2-3 days is not a problem. Mary spends every 2 weekends with my husband in our house and so during his time he picks her up on Friday and drops her off on Sunday. I noticed that during her time with us, those 2-3 days she refuses to shower but I have no idea what she is doing when she is with her mother. For those saying it is not that bad and I am overreacting, I am actually not. 2-3 days going without a shower may not be a problem when you are an adult that spends the day working in an office and moving around in a car with AC, but for a 12 years old who has a lot of activities, hormonal changes and does not wear deodorant, trust me it is bad.

5. Many people asked why I don't take Mary with me for a girl's day, spa, mani-pedi. Her mother does not agree with it. She expressed multiple times that (in her opinion) the women in our family promote unhealthy women standards and she forbid her daughter ever engaging in such activities.
6. What was my stance and input in helping Mary. As most of you probably realized, I don't have many options at hand. I have bought her a lot of natural, organic, vegan and cruelty free products, I have read and explained each label to her but she does not want to use them.

That being said, today I will sit my husband down and have a conversation with him. I will clearly inform him what my stance over this entire situation is and what I expect to happen. The rest it is up to him to decide.",Asshole,2024-09-18,"AITA for telling my husband his daughter is embarrassing me? Throwaway due to personal info shared. Also changed names for privacy.

Yesterday I (30F) was chilling at home with my MIL, talking and drinking coffee. When husband (37M) arrived, he asked me if I would take his daughter (12F) shopping for a dress.

A little bit of context, when he was younger my husband had a relationship with a woman, let's call her Sarah and they had Mary their daughter. He was having his rebel phase, going against his parents with this relationship but it did not last. He realized they are way too different as individuals and broke up when Mary was 3. I met my husband 6 years ago and we got married 4 years ago. Our relationship is amazing and I get along extremely well with my in laws. I was immediately accepted into the family and my MIL treats and introduces me to people as her daughter. As you can imagine this has caused a lot of drama with Sarah because she never received the same treatment from the family but truthfully speaking she is not someone you wish to have in your social circle.

Mary and I get along good. Everyone is on the same page that she has a mother and that I am not trying to replace her, I am just her father's wife. However she spends most of her time with her mom and Sarah is teaching her extreme hippy bs like she should not abide by the expectations society has on women, she should not feel pressured to act, look or behave as what society considers acceptable and so on. Mary therefore is allowed by her mom to not shower for days in a row, wear dirty clothes, not brush her teeth or hair. This has become her way of living because she refuses to shower or dress properly all the time. It pains me to say but she could pass as a homeless child if you see her on the street due to her appearance.

Back to yesterday, 1 month from now the entire family will attend a gala where my husband will receive an award. It's an important moment in his career and he asked me if I will go with his daughter to buy a dress for the event. I told him honestly that I prefer not to. I explained that I really feel embarrassed being seen with Mary in public. She dresses horrible and most of the time her clothes are dirty, she stinks and does not brush her hair. MIL agreed and mentioned to my husband that it would be best if Mary does not attend this event because she will make us look bad in front of all the people that will be present. I was on my MIL's side. Husband was sad but he also agreed with us and mentioned he will think about it.

AITA?

Update: 

I wrote yesterday the initial post and it blew out of proportion. The number of comments was really overwhelming but I sincerely thank you for your help and all the useful comments and DMs you sent me.

I will clarify some on the most common asked questions:

1. First of all I apologize if I offended people by mentioning the hippie feminist part. I do not think that all feminists have poor hygiene and I admit it was bad wording on my part. Being a feminist is what Mary's mother uses to describe herself and justify her parenting style.
2. No, Mary is not mixed race and she and her mother are not a different ethnicity.
3. Some people found that showering for 2-3 days is not a problem. Mary spends every 2 weekends with my husband in our house and so during his time he picks her up on Friday and drops her off on Sunday. I noticed that during her time with us, those 2-3 days she refuses to shower but I have no idea what she is doing when she is with her mother. For those saying it is not that bad and I am overreacting, I am actually not. 2-3 days going without a shower may not be a problem when you are an adult that spends the day working in an office and moving around in a car with AC, but for a 12 years old who has a lot of activities, hormonal changes and does not wear deodorant, trust me it is bad.
4. As as 12 years old Mary is not to blame for for lack of hygiene. I agree, her parents are to blame and I understood that my husband needs to step up or decide what he wants to do.
5. Many people asked why I don't take Mary with me for a girl's day, spa, mani-pedi. Her mother does not agree with it. She expressed multiple times that (in her opinion) the women in our family promote unhealthy women standards and she forbid her daughter ever engaging in such activities.

86,1fjml5h,AITA - Truly bizarre dog poo incident….,"EDIT**** the lawn went to the curb next to the road. I would certainly never walk my dog on someone’s lawn. The reason for saying I was on a call was to acknowledge I was perhaps distracted and made a mistake but I am concerned the amount of comments condoning her reaction…I mean to throw a poo bag at me after? Surely we don’t think that’s OK or maybe I’m going crazy and the world has moved on 


Something bizarre happened today….so I was walking my dog in a local neighbourhood when he did a poo on a lawn. Of course I picked it up in a doggie poo bag and wrapped it up. I should note I was on a work call during this incident. 

Slightly further up the road was a red bin with some rubbish. Yes I appreciate it’s a private bin but I popped the poo in (noting there was already rubbish in there). A few moments later and older woman came running up behind me the the poo bag threw it and hit my dog. I was obviously taken aback so said woah it was in a plastic bag sorry etc. she continued muttering and carrying on but I continued walking. After she screamed again I gave her the finger and said f*** y***

I would have happily taken the bag out had she said sorry this happens all the time it’s really annoying but to throw it at me?? Or is it actually me that’s the arsehole???

87,1fjm2ub,AITA for changing my mind about helping my GF move house?,"# About three weeks ago, I offered to help my girlfriend move house, and she was pleased with the offer. However, several factors eventually led me to feel that it might not be the best idea. I didn’t communicate these concerns to her.

Firstly, she had a large mirror, so I needed a van with a long wheelbase. As a new driver, I was intimidated by this and struggled to find rental options. Additionally, I was anxious about driving such a large vehicle due to my inexperience with its handling. To complicate matters, my finances were tight, and I had just received a parking fine.

I suggested she could use a moving service, which would be cheaper and offer insurance in case of damage. She agreed to check out the website I recommended but I also said, ""Alright, but let me know if you prefer me to do it all. I'm still totally up for helping you move; I just want you to have the most hassle-free way.""

She replied, ""I'll sort it.""

After that, communication between us stopped. I didn’t respond to her for a few days and then followed up with, ""Any updates? I still would like to come see you and help out on the 13th if you want me there."" She responded with a terse, ""Good afternoon. I won’t need any help. I booked the van.""

I interpreted this as her handling the move on her own and didn’t press further, respecting her independence. Days went by without contact, and I began to assume she was upset with me. When the moving day arrived, I didn’t reach out to ask how it went.

Later, I noticed her online at 5 a.m. and tried texting her but received no reply. The next day, she expressed her frustration with me.

She said, ""It seems like you don’t see anything wrong with what you did. How can you tell me you’re going to help me move 2/3 weeks before and then back out a week before because it’s too expensive to get the van? You sent me a link to AnyVan, suggesting I should book it myself. I find that very weird. If I have a man in my life, I need to feel his presence. You didn’t show up for me at all. You asked if you should still come and help? Help with what? I had already booked the movers. What were you going to do? Help me emotionally? It’s moving day, and you haven’t even texted to see how I moved all by myself. Instead, you start a conversation out of nowhere and ask if I’m airing you? Are you serious?""

She was also puzzled why I didn’t use my savings when my account was low, as she knew I could afford it.

I apologized, explaining I took her message literally as her handling the move and wasn’t aware of any issues until communication stopped. I didn’t mention my fear of driving the van or that I might not have been able to book it; I only suggested the moving service as a better option.

Additionally, I’m currently finishing my PhD and live 1.5 hours away from her.

88,1fjlywo,AITA for not adhering to a no-shoes rule in a formal-ish gathering,"So recently a colleague and friend decided to host a birthday party for his 35th birthday.

Generally he has a no shows policy in his house which is totally fine. This time he wanted to host like a nice posh-y party and invite also many people from work as well as friends out of the workplace, and he pitched as generally a fancy drinks, finger food party.

He lives in a nice condo with a bar and a nice view. I have been there many times before and we always had fun with movies pizza etc. of course adhering to the no shoes policy.
This time though there were many people coming and all of us were dressed up. Dressed up in the likes of suit and tie for the guys and dress and high heels for the girls. It felt very appropriate for an event that was gonna involve good wine, champagne etc.

When we went there that evening I happen to run into a couple of other people while going in, and then when we were to get in he said no shoes in the house. We were all pretty surprised. I was wearing a suit and tie, I wasn't gonna be like that and with my socks (apparently that was exactly how he was at the time, and for some reason he thought it was ok). And especially for some of the girls that hadn't been in his house before and were wearing fancy dresses, they
This time I too refused to take my shoes off, and very soon people started discussing about leaving and going to another bar downtown. I said I would follow.
My friend eventually realized that people weren't taking it and let everyone in with their shoes. Some people had already left though. Only a few went in without shoes from the beginning.

The next day, he called me and told me that I should have stood up for him and had I taken my shoes off the others would do so too (I am technically his line manager and manager of some of the other people there as well, but we don't really have this kind of dynamic).

I told him that while I have no issue whatsoever going to his house for a football game and be shoes off, I would not be ever seen in a suit and socks. And even more so he could not expect the girls wearing those fancy heels matching their dresses etc. to walk barefoot all night.

In my home I don't have a no shoes policy, but don't mind adhering to one when needed. That said my view is that while I fully respect your no shoes policy, you need to also respect the fact that sometimes I have a shoes stay on policy, and I respectfully and with no hard feelings will be leaving if this is not accepted. He is still mad mostly because due to the kerfuffle some people (especially ones we are not that close with) left before it was settled, and while I am not happy about it, I still think I was in the right. I don't even think if me doing it would have made any difference, but I guess he is upset I didn't support him, which I understand.

89,1fjlxws,AITA for having my own friends?,"I (18M) have a friend (18M) (let’s call him M) with whom I spent most time my last two years of highschool. He wasn’t my best friend, we met because he was a close friend of my bff, who left for another school, which caused M to become my friend. At that time I also had a group of three girl friends with whom I spent probably the same amount of time. At some point he tried to infiltrate that group, we didn’t really let him, but I’m not sure he realised. Of course I was still friends with him, and to me it was normal, I just had two separate groups of friends. Well, the year of our graduation, we thought about doing a trip just me, my bff and M. In the end that plan just faded away as it usually happens. That was beginning of the last year. A couple months later, my girl friends invited me to join them in a trip they were planning after grad. We talked about it at school, sometimes even close to M, but most times we tried to avoid it because of another “friend” that we feared might try to join us or else feel really hurt (he had had some issues but that’s another story). 
So, grad came, we had fun and everything was fine. I went on the trip with the girls. I even sent M some pictures of a cool train (he loves trains), to which he responded he didn’t know we were on that trip, but I didn’t give it much thought. I didn’t hear from him for a while after that, which wasn’t really that weird. When I came back home, I met with my bff to catch up. We talked about our trips (he did one as well with his friends from his school) and after some time he brought up M. I just said we hadn’t talked too much since graduating and he was like “not surprising, he’s mad at you” I was really shocked for a moment since I hadn’t even talked to him to upset him, but it turns out he felt betrayed because I didn’t invite him to the trip (remember I did not organize that trip and was invited by my girl friends) and apparently I had been keeping it from him so that he wouldn’t know I was going on a trip without him. I get that he could be upset about me going on a trip without him, considering both me and my bff (aka mutual friend) traveled and he didn’t, but he couldn’t complain about me not saying anything because I did, and he had the tendency to partially ignore me whenever I talked about anything that didn’t concern him. But the thing that bothered me the most is that at no point did he bother to tell me that I’d upset him, it seems he just wanted to break our friendship like nothing and move on, which I learnt from my bff who is just there as an intermediate. 
So, the current situation is that I know he’s mad at me and he knows I know he’s mad at me, I’m just waiting to let him get a little perspective so that we can talk it out, if he’s even willing to talk. One last clarification, he had other friends at school he knew from before we met, and I met the girls way before him, one of them was one of my childhood friends. So, Aita?

Always hated myself for not being able to get excellent grades and doing something to help my mother. Have been seeing fights after fights at my home, my father, grandmother and mother have always been fighting. My father drank a lot, everywhere we went, he also fought a lot on public spaces and was very hard on me. Got beaten a lot of times for just wanting attention and love.

Because of all this I developed people please personality, always craved attention and validation. Developed immense self hatred. People in our country value scores very much, I always was able to manage above average marks. But my lack or focus (probably adhd, I would sit hours infront of a book and would never study if it was not a day before exam) made my life hell.

Mental health because extremely worse in college, even tried doing things. Eomehow completed enginnering again with immense difficulty as I could only study a day or two before every exam. 

I somehow secured a really good paying job for a fresher but it was nightshift. I was already struggling with bad insomnia for an year or more before getting the job. It's been an year since I got the job, I never have any energy. The sleep deprivation has been hell, I am in the verge of passing out everyday. I take meds sometimes and have only 1-2 days a month when I feel good. 

I've spent 60-70% of my money to my mother and brother's education. I was very very frugal person, didn't even spent a dollar on me, for example I'm using a 6 year old, very cheap phone and I'm the third owner. Never bought expensive things, always gave any saved money to mother or bought her stuff. But, never got any validation. 

I love my mother and will keep on doing this job even if i self self distrut but it's too much now. I realised I won't amount to anything. My mother has been trying to 7-8 years to create a career in a field that's insanely hard to find success in, we don't have money, connection or family. Fights are still common, my brother's behaviour became bad and disrespectful. Dad and grandmother still bother us. A big portion of my money went to my mothers career but I know it won't work out.

She's always said that she loved me very much, makes food for me but we never talked much. I became very distant and alone during school and still am like this. I cry a lot and feel this job will take me down. But, my father will kick my mother out and my only wish is to see my mother and brother happy. I have no dreams, hope or ambition Left. 

I did develop some hatred for my mother also but I love her too much. She had a very very hard life. She did made some very bad decisions in marrying my father and some others. But the society is pretty backward and she was stuck, he childhood was also very hard and I feel bad when they tell me about their upbringing because it was very hard and it get's compared to mine. But, I did sacrifice my needs and wants. I was told that they gave me decent food and enrolled me to a decent school and a roof.

It's been an year since I got the job, I never have any energy. The sleep deprivation has been hell, I am in the verge of passing out everyday. I take meds sometimes and have only 1-2 days a month when I feel good. 

I've spent 60-70% of my money to my mother and brother's education. I was very very frugal person, didn't even spent a dollar on me, for example I'm using a 6 year old, very cheap phone and I'm the third owner. Never bought expensive things, always gave any saved money to mother or bought her stuff. But, never got any validation. 

I love my mother and will keep on doing this job even if i self self distrut but it's too much now. I realised I won't amount to anything. My mother has been trying to 7-8 years to create a career in a field that's insanely hard to find success in, we don't have money, connection or family. Fights are still common, my brother's behaviour became bad and disrespectful. Dad and grandmother still bother us. A big portion of my money went to my mothers career but I know it won't work out.

She's always said that she loved me very much, makes food for me but we never talked much. I became very distant and alone during school and still am like this. I cry a lot and feel this job will take me down. But, my father will kick my mother out and my only wish is to see my mother and brother happy. I have no dreams, hope or ambition Left. 

I did develop some hatred for my mother also but I love her too much. She had a very very hard life. She did made some very bad decisions in marrying my father and some others. But the society is pretty backward and she was stuck, he childhood was also very hard and I feel bad when they tell me about their upbringing because it was very hard and it get's compared to mine. But, I did sacrifice my needs and wants. I was told that they gave me decent food and enrolled me to a decent school and a roof.

91,1fjlqeh,AITA for not telling my friend  that everybody hates her?,"Hello guys. first time poster here just trying to gouge what the right thing to do is.

I (17F) Just started university and found out a friend of mine, let’s call her, fuckin apple idk (17F) from my old sports team is in the same program as me, so we have a lot of classes together. we hadn’t see each other in maybe 4 years but quickly became friendly again and have been hanging out with a little group we’ve created all in the same program. 

the thing about apple is that, she’s very smart. and although it’s not a bad thing at all, she can be incredibly condescending about it. when helping others or explaining anything about topics ESPECIALLY music and theory and such, it’s so infuriating when she’s passive aggressive and throws in the tone of “i know this, you don’t” or explaining things like you’re dumb. 

it’s been like this since i’ve known her. from the time we played on our team together to now she seems to not have changed and people quickly are finding this out and are talking mad shit behind her back. a number of people were talking about how much they hate apple and hate how condescending she can be and have just been upset with her in the three weeks we’ve started university. but no one has to balls to say it to her face.

knowing apple for as long as i have and being a relatively bold person, if i have a problem with apple, i usually bring it up with her right there and then, usually when she’s talking down to me when explaining something etc. so when it comes to being in those groups where people are hounding on her i stay silent or only say something that i would say to her face. other people aren’t as polite. 

now although i have painted her in negative light, i truly do believe apple isn’t ill-intentioned. i think her tone and delivery can just be incredibly off putting and i don’t think she notices it. when i do correct her, she’s nice about it and apologizes, but not everyone is able to call her out right there and then. like i said, im relatively bold. 
apple is so helpful and always willing to be there for others but she just needs to work on understanding how to talk to people and relay her information without being rude.

now, we aren’t the bestest of friends at all but i know if a group i was hanging out with was talking shit, i’d want to know. do i tell her and let her know? or do i keep quiet and let her be oblivious?

92,1fjlkc5,AITAH for telling my boyfriend I don’t like his female friend,"As I type this out, I realize I am probably the AH

So me and my bf have been together for about 6 months. He does online school and I do in person school, so we have pretty separate worlds. He has a lot of friends, mostly just a few that he hangs out with most. Today, he went to drop some stuff off at a friend of a friend’s house. He and this other friend had never met before. I knew her from my old school. She’s pretty cool and shares mostly the same friends with my bf, and is lesbian. I never minded that because again, she’s a cool person and is an amazing vibe with other people. Anyways, when my bf dropped the stuff off, she got locked out of her house and her mom wasn’t going to be back until the morning, so my bf offered her to stay with him and she said yes. I got a call from him as him and her were on their way to his house, asking if I thought it was okay that she stayed with him. (I really didn’t have any say in this, since they were already on their way there) Once they got to his house I messaged him and asked if they would be sleeping in the same room, and he said she would be sleeping in his bed and he would sleep on the couch in the living room. 

I really wanted to feel like I could trust him, but before me and him got together he got around a little, so I wasn’t sure what to make of the situation. There’s been instances before with him calling other woman attractive to my face and him saying some very inappropriate things about these other woman and it worries me sometimes. 

I told him to call me before he went to sleep, something that we have always done, and I never got a call. I sent him a long message, telling him I didn’t appreciate being put on the spot about her staying and honestly didn’t know how I felt about her staying at all. 

He responded saying that I don’t need to worry and that she’s gay, so it’s not like anything is going to happen. He said that I’m being insecure and need to get a grip on things.

I’m starting to feel like I should’ve just trusted him. AITAH?

EDIT:
I knew the girl before she came out and she was a nice person, and she kept to herself most times. When I said that I didn’t mind her being gay because she was cool, I meant she was cool about it. Very open about it and wasn’t offended by someone bringing it up, which is a problem for some homosexual people. I live in a very Christian household and my family veiws on things like sexuality are different than mine, and I’d like to clarify that I WOULD NOT have stopped being friends with her just because of her sexual preference.

I've been there every night with them and have been supportive in the ways my boyfriend has needed and have become a lot closer to his dad and sister throughout his illness. We received some horrible news a few days ago that if the treatment he is on doesn't work, then they will stop treatment and worse case scenario he only has a couple of weeks to live. My boyfriend has been the sole caretaker and his dad has been staying with him when he's not at the hospital. My boyfriend's aunt (his dad's sister) and cousin decided to come visit when they heard the news. They were planning on staying at my boyfriend's apartment which was going to work out fine. Then his cousin's husband decided to come (they live in Germany and were going to spend time in the US after visiting us). My boyfriend's dad said he doesn't feel comfortable with the cousin's husband staying with them and he doesn't even care if he sees anyone else ever again other than my boyfriend, his sister, and I. He's very sick and just wants people he's comfortable with around him. They came to an agreement that they would still come but the husband just can't stay with them (or even come hang out with them) so my boyfriend asked me if his cousin & her husband could stay with me or they'll get an Airbnb. I have never met or spoken to either of them and they would stay with me for a week.

I told my boyfriend they could stay with me if he also stays with me but he said he won't be able to every night. So I said no to them staying with me, but I feel like a huge asshole. I spent some time with my boyfriend and his dad tonight and asked if his cousin & her husband have found somewhere to stay and he said no and that they hate me now. I feel like I have done so much to support my boyfriend and his dad during this time and feel completely let down and like that all has been lost. I lost my fiancé to cancer 10 years ago so this has all been really hard for me but I've managed to support my boyfriend and his dad without bringing all that up, and am proud of how I've supported him, but it feels like this just wiped the slate clean and nothing I've done is appreciated.

I on the other hand, have zero. 

I don't really have any friends, nobody will tell you that I am unpleasant to be around. They won't say I'm rude, selfish or a bad conversationalist, but I am very quiet. I have plenty of friend acquantiences, but no real friends. My fiance and I have had the conversation over why I have no friends as she finds it concerning, but in her words ""you don't cling or do weird shit like other guys, so it's hard to bring up""

I do not get along well with my family, which consists of my mother and sister. My sister moved to another state, we don't dislike each other, but we have nothing to say to each other. My relationship with my mother is complicated, she can be emotionally manipulative and I no longer have any interest in entertaining it. I send her messages occasionally asking how she is doing, but for the past month she hasnt bothered replying, and same to my sister (my mother is ok, my sister called her friends because shes giving my sister the same treatment) I have no interest in why we are getting the silent treatment, its none of my business.

  
When I invited them both, they both delined, mom I'm not sure why, my sister doesnt want to travel interstate (I live in new south wales, she is in western australia).

After they both declined in the same day, I told my wife and she got upset and asked me why, I just shrugged and said its none of my business. Cue a discussion about ""but theyre your only family"" but its like....nobody owes me anything, I don't see why they need to come. She says I need to make an effort to get them to come, I say they've made their decisions, it's not my place to change it.

I thought the discussion was over, but she brought it up again how I need to invite someone to the wedding, I said no, Im comfortable the way it is. She brought it up yet AGAIN and I said she needs to make a decision about being marrying someone as isolated as I am, I can't make that decision for her.

97,1fjl0op,AITA For Giving my Boyfriend an Ultimatum,"Needing some unbiased advice.

I M(17) have been dating my boyfriend who we'll call K also M(17), for a about 6 months. Weve known each other our entire lives, grew up together lived next door all of that. I'll include this because I feel like it might be related but when we were 12 I was horrible and ended our friendship which lead to us hating each other for years. We made up last year and then started dating a few months after that and are very much in love. Now for the problem.

We are both seniors in high school meaning we're at that point where we are deciding about college. As I said I have known K my whole life therefore I know what his dream college is. I'm not going to give names but his dream school since he was a kid has been a school on the west coast. I don't really have a top school but his dream school is way out of my budget so its not an option at all. Ive been more looking at the east coast for money and personal reasons.

Three days ago I went over to his house. While he showered, I noticed on his desk he had a letter and when I looked closer I noticed it was from his dream school. He never mentioned getting a response, only that he applied so I was surprised and a bit confused. I opened it, maybe I shouldnt have, but I did since I noticed the seal was already broken so he clearly already read it. It was an acceptance letter, offering him a full ride. When he was out of the shower, I showed that I had read the letter and he got really quiet and tense.

I asked him when he got that and he said a couple days ago and then asked him why he didnt tell me. He tried to brush it off but I kept pushing until he told me he didnt tell me about it because he wasn't going. I was confused since this has been his dream school his whole life and he was so nervous when applying, praying he would get in. This did lead to a bit of a fight it was a big back and forth but finally he said he wasn't going because of me. Because I would be too far away. I was honestly really mad he would give up his future for me, which I told him before storming out.

I thought about the situation a lot, cant figure out why I’m the reason though. The next day I went back to his house to talk. He was quiet and clearly still mad so I said I would make it quick. I told him he had two choices. He can either go, or he can give me a good and reasonable reason why he doesn't want to go. If he doesnt go, and doesnt give me a good reason, I told him I was going to break up with him.

He looked kind of shocked and hurt and honestly saying this hurt like hell but I dont want to be the reason he gives up on his dream. I left after that, told him to think about it and we havent talked sense. Our friends think I took it too far and that an ultimatum was unfair. A few understand where I was coming from but still think I was an asshole. Now I'm questioning whether what I did was wrong or not.

He never mentioned getting a response, only that he applied so I was surprised and a bit confused. I opened it, maybe I shouldnt have, but I did since I noticed the seal was already broken so he clearly already read it. It was an acceptance letter, offering him a full ride. When he was out of the shower, I showed that I had read the letter and he got really quiet and tense.

I asked him when he got that and he said a couple days ago and then asked him why he didnt tell me. He tried to brush it off but I kept pushing until he told me he didnt tell me about it because he wasn't going. I was confused since this has been his dream school his whole life and he was so nervous when applying, praying he would get in. This did lead to a bit of a fight it was a big back and forth but finally he said he wasn't going because of me. Because I would be too far away. I was honestly really mad he would give up his future for me, which I told him before storming out.

I thought about the situation a lot, cant figure out why I’m the reason though. The next day I went back to his house to talk. He was quiet and clearly still mad so I said I would make it quick. I told him he had two choices. He can either go, or he can give me a good and reasonable reason why he doesn't want to go. If he doesnt go, and doesnt give me a good reason, I told him I was going to break up with him.

He looked kind of shocked and hurt and honestly saying this hurt like hell but I dont want to be the reason he gives up on his dream. I left after that, told him to think about it and we havent talked sense. Our friends think I took it too far and that an ultimatum was unfair. A few understand where I was coming from but still think I was an asshole. Now I'm questioning whether what I did was wrong or not. So, AITA?",0.0,1.059345841407776,1,0
98,1fjkqlb,AITA for complaining about someone quitting?,"I started working a warehouse job as a package handler earlier this month. One of the dudes I was working with had been complaining about the job since we started. Our job was to load certain delivery trucks and his complains were how there wasn’t enough people to help load the trucks and the belts for our 5 hour shifts.

Today, he had quit 1-2 hours into the shift even though I tried to convince he can’t leave yet since we were finished but he said what he repeated for 2 weeks about how it’s not worth $16 an hour since he didn’t have anybody to support him while he was working his difficult job. He left without finishing loading the truck and I had to turn off the belt for loading since it wouldn’t be moving. I had to shift from loading boxes on one belt to another to loading over flowing boxes on carts and a belt wasn’t gonna move.

We ended up getting 2 new hires to help loading on their 1st day on the job and filled about 2 trucks before we left. Every time I passed someone I kinda vented on them and kept saying how he left me for dead and dipped mid shift. A lot of the weren’t as upset I was about the packages piling on the floors while it went down and I basically got a lot of “sh!t happens” responses when I told people why they were getting extra packages on the belt. At my other job, one of my managers said her husband has had similar experiences and this stuff happens all the time, plus some people did say they didn’t really blame him because not everyone is cut out for these jobs. Part of me thinks I should’ve just moved on and gotten used to it since they still let me go on time and let someone else finish overtime.

EDIT/INFO: He is not the only person that has the load the truck. At a certain point of the loading belt filling I am supposed to help him load the truck until it starts to clear again and I help him load every time. I am not going to say that I load as much as he does but I help as much and make sure we can leave on time.

The company also does orientations every week to add a bunch of new people.

Just to be clear, I thought he was gonna quit earlier since he would make the repeated complaint every day, I’m more upset that he still came to work just to leave in about an hour into the shift with the exact same feeling when he could have stopped coming in.

No, I exaggerated when I said told everyone I passed, it didn’t just affect me, a lot of people had to sort the packages that weren’t meant for them and I complained to the people who were affected on that belt line.",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-18,"AITA for complaining about someone quitting?

Recently, all she’s done is make up lies and talk bad about literally anyone she can think of to me and Rosie.

I've had multiple experiences of her being problematic and lying before this year, but they'd been separated and I'd given her the benefit of the doubt for the most part. One example is where she lied about being mixed. She told me her mom is Korean (her mom is extremely white) and then later tried to gaslight me into thinking her mom was half mexican for no reason. She tells so many pointless and problematic lies that are clearly not true to me and Rosie's face. I've done my best to not be confrontational, because every time I do confront her she either starts lying, gets super defensive, or starts crying (usually all three.) This past week, I had to confront her. I was walking with her and Rosie at lunch (involuntarily), and she made multiple racist jokes towards me.

101,1fjkh82,AITA for not clarifying things better with my best friend?,"This is a fake name 

 I 26F have been friends with my 25F let's call her Cierra since we were 13.  

 Cierra & I were inseparable, we were codependent on each other for about 3 years. We both made new friends & started spending time with other people but still talked every day.  

 She started to pull away after a scenario that does not affect this story at all so I won't go into detail about it. Due to that scenario we didn't speak for 9 months or so. Cierra started to get closer to one of her new friends she had met about a year before that situation had occurred.  

 Some time passed & I noticed some major changes in our friendship. I didn't have a problem with Cierra being distant due to major life changes. However, I started to notice she only made posts talking about missing other friends & never me. I did not at first care until it became consistent that Cierra never posted about me. I felt she was embarrassed of me as a friend. I never brought it up because I thought I was just overthinking. That was until Cierra & I decided to go on a vacation just her & I.  

 The first day we were there it was a long day but it was great. I did notice throughout the day that Cierra was on her phone but I just brushed it off. On the second day, it was about the same but Cierra was more on her phone than the day before & I thought it was just the fact that we were doing things that I was a little more into than her. So again I brushed it off. On the third day the one we were so excited for due to the plans we had set, but again even during some events we were experiencing Cierra wasn't speaking to me & was on her phone again. At this point, I felt uncomfortable & felt like she didn't want me there or would've rather been with someone else.  

 So I reached out to a friend of mine. I had just said I was ready to come home, she answered  Why what's wrong? I said that I felt like Cierra didn't want me there. As I sent this message she read it over my shoulder. I didn't want to bring up my feelings about the scenario until our travels back home because I didn't want to make things uncomfortable. We had a conversation about it where I explained that she was on her phone a lot & just made me unwanted. Cierra didn't speak much on the travels home I just assumed it was exhaustion, so I brushed it off. I was sending her messages & I was getting no response. I finally reached out & said are you mad at me? Cierra said She wasn't mad at me but she was upset about what happened on our vacation. I responded with something along the lines of I understand your feelings I made sure I took accountability for not saying something sooner. Cierra said she was upset that when she confronted me about it ""I couldn't give her an explanation."" I said that I did explain my feelings & if I didn't clarify enough I would've gone into further detail had she asked. I did apologize again. I never got a response.

Today, one of his aunts, the one they referred to as the bulldog came by to talk to me while he was out about our divorce.  Apparently, he came by today and told her about our split and she wanted to get my side of the story, along with berate me for things that he was saying were true that were not. She also wanted to try to mediate things in the attempt of reconciliation.

None of it was anything new but he got extremely defensive and frustrated. He stalked around, said some really insulting things to me and had a full on meltdown. I said very little, it was all him and his aunt. After she left, he flipped out on a friend about how horrible I am. Then told me he just doesn’t have the words and can’t believe what I did to him. 

I wasn’t trying to turn his aunt against him, or make her choose sides. I was simply trying to defend myself, in my own home, against the accusations that she was relaying to me.

She pushed and asked questions and pushed some more and then brought out the things that he’s accusing me of that I mentioned above.  I defended myself. I told the truth, or at least my side of the story, when he came home shortly after she confronted him with my side of the story.

None of it was anything new but he got extremely defensive and frustrated. He stalked around, said some really insulting things to me and had a full on meltdown. I said very little, it was all him and his aunt. After she left, he flipped out on a friend about how horrible I am. Then told me he just doesn’t have the words and can’t believe what I did to him. 

I wasn’t trying to turn his aunt against him, or make her choose sides. I was simply trying to defend myself, in my own home, against the accusations that she was relaying to me. Things that he is accusing me of to his family. does that make me the asshole? Or should I just have said nothing and let them continue to believe That I am abusing him while he is being the perfect spouse?
I feel absolutely horrible and am terrified of what he is going to do as retribution. I just want things to be over and we part amicable. But I feel like in her attempt to mediate, it just made it 1000xs worse. ",0.0,0.0027890105266124,0,1
105,1fjjw5a,AITA?! 🤦‍♀️ For Not supporting my fiancé during his difficult time…?,"Am I the asshole?? I have been with my fiancé for six years now. He has been on testosterone for the majority of our relationship. He recently (approximately two months ago) gotten off testosterone because he was afraid it could affect him long term. 

Even since he has become unbearable to be around. He’s gone from a loving, caring partner to absolutely cold hearted. Basically his heart has turn to stone. He shows me zero affection what’s so ever. When I try to insinuate any kind of physical touch with him he looks flat out grosses out or basically just friend zones me. 
It’s gotten to the point in which I feel like I’m just living amongst another roommate. Which makes me super sad because yes we had our issues, like most relationships do. But at the end of the day he was still a loving partner. 

I am trying to be understanding about his situation but it has gotten to the point in which I feel constantly rejected by him & pushed away.

The other day, we went to a doctors appointment so he could discuss his testosterone situation with our doctor. I had booked an appointment for myself because my prescription for birth control was almost out, so I figured I would just tag along at his appointment since we usually go to our doctors appointment together. He asked me to wait in the vehicle since our doctors office was in a rougher neighbourhood and he has a nice vehicle, which I was fine with doing..during his appointment I was texting him the whole time, although he was more concerned about his car then me. I kindly reminded him I needed to pick up my prescription as well so I couldn’t miss my appointment. After this he messaged me saying, “why it’s not like we have sex anyways?”
To which I replied, “well that’s not because of anything I’m doing…that’s on you.”

Then he said “yeh, but no need to waist money”

So that’s where I’m at. Truly lost on what to do here. Yes I love my fiancé but it has gotten to the point where he shows me zero affection. I mean I’m a 27 year old women, I’m still youngish if I did choose to end the relationship and move on. He’s 32, so it’s not like he’s a senior citizen….

Also FYI he has gotten paperwork to take his blood tests to see if his hormones are off balanced and he basically refused to go & just keeps making excuses why he can’t go. 🤔",Not the A-hole,2024-09-18,"AITA?! 🤦‍♀️ For Not supporting my fiancé during his difficult time…?

I didn't want to be rude so I accepted the gift, before explaining to her why I didn't get anything from anyone else. She told me it's not healthy and that I should find peace with myself and move on.

Accepting the gift led to an argument with my other friend 'Vanessa'(18f) when she found out, accusing me of only accepting the gift because I think Leah is cute and have feelings for her. She is upset because I never let her get me any presents and never did anything fun with her on my birthdays(she used to ask if she can take me to the cinema or bowling). Told me I have to return the present to Leah cause it isn't fair she didn't get to give me anything.

So I called her a 'bossy jerk.' She recoiled before telling me I'm being unfair and not thinking about how she feels after she spent years looking at me sulking on my birthdays.

My gf got upset and said I saw her get ready and that she likes to be dressed for spontaneity. I said okay but I would’ve appreciated a heads up because I literally told her I only wanted to go look at the moon.

109,1fjjmsn,AITA for falling for my best friend's ex?,"I (26M) was best friends with David (26M) for the past three years. David dated Amy (25F) for a couple of years in college, but they broke up about four/five years ago. Even though they’re not together anymore, they remained as very close friends. David still has unresolved feelings for Amy, and although Amy denies having any feelings for him, they tried to get back together last year, but it didn’t work out because he was in a situationship with a different girl and was later caught by Amy.

Last October, Amy and I started hanging out more after we attended a rave together. We became very close in the following weeks and ended up talking frequently. This eventually escalated into a casual friends-with-benefits relationship as we gradually became more intimate with each other. I didn’t tell David about this at the time because I was afraid of how he would react, given his feelings for Amy. After a while, I realized I was starting to develop feelings for Amy, so I told her I needed to distance myself from her and revealed of my concerns in falling in love with her.

Amy was shocked about my potential romantic interests and asked for space. She later proceeded to tell David and our friend group (we were all part of a large friend group) that I had asked her out, which wasn’t exactly true and an oversimplification of what happened, especially since she left out information about our past intimacy. As a result, I was labeled as a traitor and ghosted by the rest of our friend group. For the last six months, I’ve been holding onto the full truth of what happened between Amy and me. I never told David everything because I didn’t want to cause more drama and potentially ruin his friendship with Amy. Everyone in the group remain as close friends.

Although I did have a conversation with David regarding what happened, I left out all details of how I started to develop feelings for Amy that I assumed she wouldn't have brought up to him. David was understandably upset at me for betraying his trust and breaking the bro code.  

I’m thinking of telling David the full truth, but I know that doing so could hurt him and damage his friendship with Amy. Part of me wants closure because I’ve been carrying this emotional weight for six months, and part of me feels like I’ve got nothing to lose anymore since I’ve already been isolated from the group, been carrying the bulk of the burden, and been living under severe depression for months. I understand that I am at fault for keeping secrets from David in the first place and breaking the bro code and I am in no way innocent, but I am also conflicted as to whether I deserve to take all this blame and pain given the context.

My siblings are married and between the two of them, there are 5 kids. My wife and I have 3 kids. My wife's sister is a single mom with 2 kids. Those kids are the youngest of the entire group.

We have established gifting limits by age, so as the kids get older their gifts get a little more expensive. My siblings' kids and our kids are pretty close in age, while my wife's sister's kids are much younger. There's a 10 year gap between the older group and my wife's sister's oldest child.

My wife feels bad about her sister being a single mom. The baby daddy was an absent father, so I think she's better off, tbh. So she wants to spend the same amount of money for those 2 kids as we spend on the older kids, which for 2 kids is almost $150 extra dollars for Christmas than what we'd all agreed on for their ages.

If it was just $150 then it wouldn't be a big deal, but their family tradition is to buy gifts for ***everyone*** in the extended family. So this really adds up! So I told my wife that I was not comfortable with her sister's kids being given special treatment. We had a fight about it with my wife saying that they don't have a dad so what's the harm in giving them more presents? I don't feel like this is fair to the other kids, and my SIL kids don't suffer from a shortage of presents. My in-laws give them a lot more attention, IMO. This is something that creates stress every holiday season.

ETA: The gifting limits are broadly agreed upon with my siblings, and my SIL is aware of them and has respected the limits when buying gifts for our kids.

ETA2: To clarify, when I said my wife's family gives gifts to EVERYONE, that means she gives gifts to her Aunts, Uncles, Cousins, Cousins' children, etc. There are a LOT of gifts being given on her side of the family, some of which we have to ship overseas. 

On my side, I give my siblings and their families gifts, but not my aunts and uncles and cousins. We just never did that growing up, so it's normal for us.

113,1fjj4s0,AITA for asking my fiancé's sister to pay her phone bill?,"Some background: my fiancé (M30, let's call him Dan) took in his younger sister (M22, let's call her Anna) who lived with him from when she was 18-21. Anna used to live with their dad but he's an alcoholic asshole so Dan let her live with him. I moved in with them a year later and after a couple years, Dan and I moved out to our own place because we wanted to live just the two of us, to a better area, and also my fiancé acted as a father to his sister and needed some distance. Anna moved back into their mom's house as we thought it'd be better and cheaper for her especially. 

Fast forward to now, Dan and I have lived in our new place for a year and love it. And Anna seems to be doing well living with their mom. However, Dan put his sister on his phone plan when she moved in with him since she didn't want to be on their dad's plan and she has essentially stopped paying my fiancé back. We checked within the last year and she owes him $600 and has never communicated with us that she couldn't pay it. She has a job and minimal bills. My fiancé hasn't been pushy for her to pay because he feels guilty for ""kicking her out"" and moving. I recently joined my fiancé's phone plan and found all this out. I told him I was concerned with her not paying and doesn't understand why he doesn't ask her to pay. I get frustrated because she often made him pay for things or doesn't pay him back after he  asks her to. We are getting married soon and $600 isn't a small amount to me. 

My fiancé thinks I'm the asshole for wanting her to pay her part of the phone bill because she's gone through a lot but I think she should, especially because I know she goes on trips with friends, buys a lot of alcohol, and has the money to do so.

now, lately I've been getting more comfortable with how I'm presenting myself. I'm more masculine than other girls, and it doesn't help I have more hair than other girls might. but rather than be insecure, I made the choice to embrace it and be happy with who God made me.

my parents disagree, and they keep telling me I'm not a boy(I'm a girl, but Idrc abt it, im just tryna be comfy)my mom, in particular, is more admant on this, given  her past with facial hair. she was teased for it growing up, and has decided that I'll be made fun of like she was if I grow facial hair.

this hasn't been the case since I've been taking drivers ed(im homeschooled). heck, nobody cares, they got their own things going on that they'd rather focus on than my facial hair!

and it's not really the face hair, either, but just the fact that i look masculine. in face and body(minus the chest, wanna get rid of that.) I've been mistaken for a boy multiple times, and my parents are always livid at it, but I don't care.

short story, mom and I had an argument about my facial hair and it made me upset, doesn't help I'm on my cycle, and we had a small disagreement when I got home. she told me it's not natural, I disagreed and told her to stop projecting and told her(and dad) that the two of them were making me feel ugly for wanting to present myself comfortably. she told me she's sorry she caused my facial hair problem. 

I just don't want them to see me as 'their odd child'' anymore. I just wanna be their beloved child. 

I'm fully comfortable in my own skin, and it seems to make my parents uncomfortable. I'm not committing any sin, they're just being fussy. they're not abusive or manipulative, but this is a toxic trait of theirs I detest. AITA?

117,1fjhsxw,AITA for telling my roommate she’s entitled ,"My roommate (24f) and I (22f) decided to cosign a lease for a house 6 months ago. We were friends, not super close, but we enjoyed spending time together and I was initially excited to live with her. 

For background I have been on my own since i was 17. I had no choice but to be financially independent, but it stung when she told me that she wants to be like me because she wants to know what it’s like to be an adult and have adult responsibilities. I brushed it off because I knew she meant no harm and told myself that I was just jealous that she has been financially supported. 

When we first moved in together I did a lot for her. I drove her everywhere she wanted to go (she doesn’t have a car nor drivers license), taught her how to cook dinner, and let her sleep in my bed with me because she didn’t have a mattress yet. About a week later, I overheard her talking on the phone saying that I got too drunk at the karaoke bar we went to and I embarrassed her by cheering too loud. I was hurt because I was just trying to support her (she wants to be a professional singer). I didn’t confront her directly but told her that I need my own space and that I had an air mattress that she can set up in her room. I also told her that she’s going to have to pitch in for gas money especially because i drove an hour both ways to bring her to an open mic. She said that she couldn’t because she’s saving money to buy a mattress.

Honestly, the only person to blame here is myself. There was no need for me to overextend my kindness to someone who doesn’t reciprocate that same effort. That’s okay, lesson learned. I’ve set boundaries and distanced myself from her. We are roommates but I no longer consider her a friend.

Fast forward to a few days ago, I remind her that she has yet to pay me for her share of utilities for the past 4 months. She said that it will take a while. At this point I am fed up so I told her that her mom will just have to send me the money directly. She got defensive and said that her mom doesn’t owe me anything and that I should be more considerate. I started to go off on her and said that I’ve never met someone more entitled. I actually have to work to pay my bills so maybe she should get a job so she can do the same. She then tells me that she’s not going to argue with a privileged white girl. This made me so angry that I left the house and went for a drive before things got uglier.

I dont think I’m the AH here but at the same time I blame myself because I shouldn’t have let these things build up overtime. I should have approached the situation calmly.

When I got to choose my instrument last Friday I had completely forgotten I'd even had this conversation and I was set on playing a percussion instrument.

121,1fjgvvg,AITA - for telling friend not to bring up names of people I want to forget about? ,"Decades ago, I (F,56) had a group of 6-7 “friends” all around the same age. I had a falling out with two of them, and it was very bad.  They crank-called me so that I had to change my home phone number, and crank-called me at work and contributed to a harassment situation (they made friends with someone I worked with and involved him in the crank-calling) which ended up involving Human Resources and my having to find another job. Just mentioning their names brings up horrible memories. That was about 25 years ago.

I have moved out of state and keep in touch with only one of the original crowd.  She still associates with the two crank callers.  She didn’t have any conflict with them and I understand that. My problem is that recently she has been bringing up their names when we talk or text.  Every time she does I am flooded with bad memories, get upset, and the conversation goes south fast. The last time was not pretty.  I made it clear that I don’t wish to talk about those two individuals and just want to purge my memories of them.  She just says she is not involved, and claims she didn’t know about the crank calling, which is absolutely not true. I don’t know if she honestly is just remembering “good times” as we are getting older, or if she is being passive aggressive.

She and I have no other issues and used to enjoy visiting when I am back in town.  We’ve been friends for 40 years. I want to know if people think IATA for telling her not to bring up the names of people who trigger very bad memories for me.  

Maybe I should mention that of all these people I am the only one who is financially independent from my family. I purchased two homes as a single woman and work a full-time job in high tech.

One day, **the new girl** came up to me told asked if she could ask me a question and told me not to repeat it to anyone else. I said sure, she asked me if my friend didn't like her. I was confused at first but informed me that **the new girl** made a certain joke towards my friend, my friend didn't like the joke and she made another snippy joke back and ever since that day, the new girl has been feeling like there has been tension between them. I told her that my friend usually has a bold/confrontational personality but if she truly said or felt like there has been tension between them, that she should talk to my friend about it. **The new girl** ended up telling the manager and the manager was suppose to have a sit down talk with my friend (my manager never talked to my friend).

123,1fjgcxm,AITA for not attending my sisters destination wedding ,"To offer some background, my sister recently got engaged. Her significant other jumped through hoop after hoop to make the engagement go EXACTLY the way she wanted it to. She gave him a list of approved places attempted to follow to a T and I was happy at the time to help. He put a $500 deposit down on a theatre rental to do the proposal but the rental didn’t go through online, he put another $500 down on a rooftop hotel she loves and when she found out what was happening and where it was, got mad at him because he answered her questions and she figured out the proposal was happening then. Last weekend, they rescheduled their proposal twice because things were not going EXACTLY how she wanted them to. 

I am a mother of two and also caring for my kids great grandmother who has dementia. I work full time and I’m a full time student. I put off grocery shopping and homework and laundry and had to pick said grandmother up from her sister in laws house the day they finally decided to get engaged last minute. I was unable to make it to the proposal but said if someone wanted to video chat me I could join that way while I finished up everything I had put off the first two days they were supposed to get engaged. 

Fast forward to today, she posts on Facebook that she is having her wedding in Malibu. We live in Tucson, Az. She texted me to ask me if I would make it and told me she would need my answer within the next two weeks. She explicitly stated that if I could not make it, it was “totally okay”.  I explained to her that because I work at a school, I will still be working when her wedding happens and I would have to try to find someone to care for great grandma as well as my pets and somehow come up with the money to take me and both of my kids to Malibu (because she’s only paying for a rental) and I explained to her that towards the end of the year, they stop allowing our time off requests so if I miss days of work I won’t get paid for them. 

She got super passive aggressive and replied “so is that a no?” “I’m just gonna take that as a no.” “I’m sorry that you have to work. I know work is so important.” And then blocked me on Facebook Messenger. 

I just feel like she should understand that not everyone can drop their whole lives and make it to an out of state wedding. I kind of feel like she’s acting like a complete child and her maturity is not at the level of someone that should be getting married… but you guys tell me… Am I the Asshole??",Not the A-hole,2024-09-18,"AITA for not attending my sisters destination wedding  To offer some background, my sister recently got engaged.

124,1fjg7kz,AITA for snapping at my sister for continuously announcing my pregnancy to strangers?,"Almost exactly what the title says. I'm(25F) on my second pregnancy, about 20 weeks as of writing this, but I'm small. Bump only shows if I'm wearing a tight shirt or dress. Usually my pregnancy goes under the radar.

My younger sister(23F) always feels the need to but it into conversations that I'm pregnant. With complete strangers. Waiters, cashiers, our real-estate agent, whoever we're currently engaged with, she will find a way to announce my pregnancy.

Examples




Me counting change: Damn sorry. I always miscount at least once, one second.

Sister: Haha! Oh yeah PREGNANCY Brain right??

Cashier: oh you're pregnant?

Sister: Yeah she's ___ weeks, she doesn't look it tho. She's so skinny because she's got hyperemesis. Yeah she's *ALWAYS* throwing up.

Cashier: oh... uh congrats.

~~~~~


Real estate agent: OK so you're going to start packing in a few weeks?

Me: yes, we'll be leaving the house next month, but we can get it packed up sooner to bare minimums for showings.

Sister: Yeah well, SHE won't be packing it. Cause she can't pick up the heavy things.

REA: Oh goodness, did you hurt yourself?

Sister: No she's pregnant!

REA: that's so amazing, congratulations! Do know what you're having yet, babies are so fun

Sister: They're having a *gender*

REA: Fun, oh I have 3, *gender* are the best. Do you have a name?

Me: not yet, we've been going back and forth, haven't picked one.

Sister: I thought you picked ______






I'm just so frustrated my news is never my news, and my personal information is being given out without my consent. We haven't even announced the name and weren't planning on doing so until baby was born, my sister just overheard my husband and I talking about it. So after the agent left I kinda snapped at her to stop just telling people about *my* pregnancy, especially strangers we don't know or trust. I didn't say it very nicely at first, definitely snappish.

She got defensive and started crying, saying why does it matter if we already announced it to friends and family? 
It just makes me feel bulldozed, put on the spot, and uncomfortable when she does this. I tried explaining it to her but she cut me off saying 
""Whatever I get it, I can't be happy for you"" making me feel like a dick.

So we were preparing this very day for work. He told me that his friend ( Josh ) from another state is also coming to our state but in a different location and needs a house to rent for him and his team to live at. Josh asked him to help get an apartment they could stay in but since I knew the area better we could search for the apartment for him and maybe we could get some cuts ( Money ) I felt that was not bad. He told me he had requested permission from the office and we could go search for the apartment.

We went this very day to search for the apartment and after a very long day and search we were able to get one, he informed Josh about it and made videos for him and Josh loved it, He said he would send the payment to him so he could sort everything and they would just have to move down and settle in.  
The following day Mike told me that Josh had sent the money for the apartment but he was waiting for the Apartment guy to send details or so.

Suddenly we didn't see Mike at work or at home, he went incommunicado for days, days turned into weeks, and weeks into 2 months. After which Josh had to travel down to our side looking for him and we told him he was incommunicado and we had not seen him in about 2 months now. Apparently, he has spent the money on only what God Knows. So he said who can we get to to help reach him, then I remembered he has a girlfriend so we went to the girl's place and saw someone that reached him and Josh told him that he wanted to see him or else the Police would be on him, He said he would show the following day which he did the following day.

Then we went to the station to undertake that he was going to refund the money and all as Josh wanted, after everything the case was settled and They reached an agreement for him to refund the money in 3 months. But since he resumed back to the office and started work Mike has been giving me a cold attitude because he felt I was the one that made Josh get him and that is why would I have taken him to his girlfriend's place, and I was like did you want to disappear with his money and not pay when he wanted you to do something for him ( Josh ) with it?

He has not been talking to me and making me feel like I did a bad thing, Just because I was the one that took Josh to his girlfriend's place and also took Josh to the policeman who helped with the case, he said I was a bad friend and why would I have done that to him and FYI I asked him before he went incommunicado that hope he didn't spend Josh's money and he said it was intact.

My wife 'rescued' a cat a year ago. He is the most frustratingly annoying creature on the planet. 

He screams for attention 24/7. He does not allow us to do anything without his input. I haven't slept through once since we got him. He wails all night, incessantly. He's cost us thousands of dollars in vet bills and behaviourists trying to figure out whats wrong and how to fix it.

Ultimately he's an orange cat and apparently they're prone to being assholes. He's healthy and has all of his needs met. He's treated better than most cats.

I am at my wits end. He wants wet food 24/7 and he will scream all night until someone gives in and feeds him. He has kept me awake for hours. If he's not screaming he's scratching at the wall or door. He just stands there, scraping his feet against the wall, staring into my soul.

I was a single father for the first seven years of my sons life and let me tell you working 14hr days and coming home to a colicky newborn was easier than whatever fucking torture methods this cat is trained in. 

I want rid of the cat. My wife knows how hard he is and doesn't think he'll be adopted and so doesn't want to give him up. At this point I do not care.

I told her she can either move into the garage with him at night and deal with him solo or we can get rid of him. But I refuse to suffer any longer because this fat orange cat can't survive an hour without a meal.

My wife is pretty upset - we took on the responsibility of a cat together, we should keep looking for solutions together, she shouldn't have to suffer solo just because she doesn't want him to end up on some euth list. I do not care. I am exhausted. 

My kids think I'm evil but also refuse to do anything to help with tne cat so I'm not super keen on listening to them.

Now my mom wants to play besties with my wife and brought over some food. My wife has been nonstop puking since she first went to the ER.  My mom is acting all supportive now but my wife tossed out the food and asked my mom to leave. My mom cannot wrap her head around why my wife doesn’t want to talk to her about the baby and my mom is just trying to help. I told my mom my wife doesn’t like you and it’s all your fault about how you have treated her so I told my mom to fuck off and give my wife space and stop trying to help. No one wants it.

My mom tried crying about the situation saying she just wants to be involved and support my wife. I told my mom the time to prove that was in the past.",0.0,1.0141490697860718,1,0
128,1fjfm16,AITA for missing my Grandmothers bday to see a friend visiting for 2 days,"For context, my grandparents are living with my family right now. Unlike my siblings, their other grandchildren, I am home with them all day and do more for them than the rest of the kids in the family. Me being home is a consequence of being the youngest child so naturally I am around to help more than my other siblings. 

Dont get my wrong I absolutely love my grandparents and love spending time with them, but sometimes I feel like I am just expected to do certain things even if it is at the expense of my personal life. And honestly, I feel like my parents often don't treat me like I have a personal life. I'm not treated as a mature individual with my own life and things going on to the same degree as the older childtren.

Regardless, my grandmothers birthday is today, but my childhood friend has come into town this week and is only free two nights to hang out, and naturally I want to get some time with him before he leaves as I likely won't see him again til next year. 

Now we had a full celebration for my grandmother last night where all the family came and we cut cake, the whole deal. Now I had admittedly planned this evening way in advance and had forgotten the date, but now my parents want me to cancel or plan around dinner tonight with my grandma, which would be hard because my friend is working and can't hang too late, nor can he hang for long before dinner as he's busy.

Don't get me wrong, I do feel bad about missing the birthday dinner, but I feel like in this case it's somewhat justified considering I will have al the time in the world after tonight to make it up to my grandma, whereas I won't see my friend again for a while after he leaves. My parents have now been guilt tripping me about choosing to hang out with my friend tonight and it kind of pisses me off because now I can't even enjoy tonight without feeling guilty or that I have wronged them.

Maybe I am being selfish or inconsiderate and trust me he and I had the time to meet other times this week I would have surely moved the plans, but he doesn't have that much free time.

130,1fjfej8,AITA for playing dead in a pool?,"I (21F) am a lifeguard at a children's swim school. Today, there was a mandatory staff meeting regarding lifeguard and safety training. During this meeting, the entire staff was in the pool, observing and/or demonstrating what to do in the case of spinal injuries. Staff took turns with who played the roles of the lifeguards and who played the role of the injured students. Here's where the problem comes in.

I was selected to play the role of an ***unconscious*** child during a demonstration about how to secure and remove a knocked-out child with a spinal injury from the pool using a backboard. Usually, the person playing the injured child will have their eyes open and instinctually hold themselves up, sometimes giggling or smiling because it’s a little awkward. I, however, decided that if I was supposed to be unconscious from a spinal injury, then I was going to act the part.

I jumped into the water and came to the surface face down and motionless. I did not move, open my eyes, smile, or talk. I kept my body limp the entire time, making the people rescuing me deal with my dead weight, as they would if this was a real situation. The people getting me onto the board and lifting out of the pool kept asking me if they were hurting me from grabbing my wrist and lifting, but I didn't respond. I remained unresponsive and limp.

As I was lifted from the pool and dragged to a safe location on the backboard, one of the girls (16F), V, working on me told me to open my eyes and answer her. I didn't. I felt her check my pulse and breathing. When our boss blew the whistle signaling the end of the demonstration, I opened my eyes and popped up, smiling at those who were marveling at my ability to keep a straight face. The meeting moved on, but I kept getting death stares from V.

After the meeting concluded, V approached me upset and told me that it wasn't nice of me to have played dead and not break character to help lift myself onto the board or answer her questions. She said that when I jumped into the water and came up face down, she really thought I had hurt myself, and me not breaking character when she asked furthered that thought. V is still in training, so it made her panic. I apologized, stating my rationale that I thought it would be best for everyone to be dead weight and not give any help or indication, as that's how it would be in a real emergency, and that I ""just wanted an excuse to have a quick nap!"" I said this in an over-the-top way that conveyed the last part was a joke, but it just set her off. V told me I was an AH for freaking her out and ""convincing"" her that I was hurt.

I can understand where she's coming from, everyone else playing an injured child had their eyes open and held themselves up, some even giggling and talking. I just wanted to make things realistic. I didn't slip and fall into the pool, I waited for my boss to signal to everyone to start the simulation and hopped in, coming up ""unconscious.""

131,1fjfdvg,AITA for not inviting my sister to my wedding?,"To give you a brief backstory, my sister and I are two years apart and she hated me growing up. And not just the normal sibling hate she truly hated me. When I was 18, I dated a guy from our friend group. He ended up cheating on me with my best friend and being an abuser. When we broke up, he told the whole friend group a bunch of BS and everyone exiled me from the group. My sister included, she believed everything he said. I ended up dating a guy from the group a while after. He was the only person who would talk to me and would be nice to me, but apparently was someone my sister had a crush on. He had no feelings towards her and never liked her. We dated for about a month or two. It’s important to note my sister and I worked at the same daycare at this time. she decided to write in our group chat that I was a whore and a man stealer. (She did have a boyfriend at this time.)

A year or so go by and we end up living together for a short period of time during Covid and we get along pretty good for the first time. Her boyfriend was kind of demeaning towards me and always made jokes that made me sound stupid, but I always just shrugged it off because they were jokes.

Flash forward she’s about to get married and she wants me to be the maid of honor and officiate the wedding. I said yes because she said it would be really important to her because I know their love story the most apparently. The whole thing was a shit show because I’ve never done any of that before and she only wanted to communicate through text. She always took what I was saying as me having an attitude when I would just be asking questions. The wedding was also a shit show and she was a total bridezilla the whole day. She called me stupid periodically when I would ask her what she would need. had me do a bunch of the wedding parties hair because I’m a hairstylist, but never paid me. which is fine, but I didn’t plan to do that and I had a lot of responsibilities that day. 

Now flash forward to to my elopement. I bought a dress off of Facebook marketplace alone, with no one. But wanted to try on dresses with my mom and when we did, I ended up finding a dress that I really wanted so I bought it. I sent it to everyone afterwards saying sorry they couldn’t be there, but I wasn’t planning on buying a dress. Everyone was super excited. Except for her she was pissed. She told me that she wasn’t going to talk to me until she was ready because she was upset.
Months go by and she doesn’t talk to me. She only talks to me at family events. I talked to her a few times but that’s it. Then I get a text about a month before the elopement saying how dare I not invite her. I tried to be nice at first and say it’s just because we only have the parents and our closest friends going.

One night, she called to say she was going into labor and asked me to watch her puppy. I agreed, and she gave me detailed instructions, including putting the dog in a safety harness when taking him outside.

Later, I took the dog out and brought him back in, but I hadn’t fully taken off his harness when he ran toward the living room where my mom was on FaceTime with my sister’s boyfriend. I finished taking the harness off, but minutes later, I got angry texts from my sister accusing me of mistreating her dog because he was still in the harness for a few extra minutes.

She even said we wouldn’t meet the baby until we earned her trust back.

133,1fjf5zc,AITA for refusing to make my brother a sandwich?,"For the time being, me (22F) and my brother (23M, “Khenan”) have moved back in with our parents (49F) (52M) to avoid paying rent while we took an at home zoom coding class, which is incredibly time consuming. 8 hours a day, camera on at all times, which leaves us no time to go to work.

We set up home 2 months before the class began, and I’ve noticed “Khenan” began putting food in the fridge/freezer in bags for days ahead of time. I understand a week ahead of time, but he preps it up to 2 days ahead of time.

I told him this was unfair, but he’d say he bought it with his own money, and he can’t waste time. But for reasons I can’t be bothered to get into, I’m low on money despite working longer than he ever has, on games and hygiene and clothes. He plays more games than me. He and everyone else will deny it but if I have no money, I don’t believe he has much either.

This Sunday, he was arguing with our mother. From what I understood, she said some of the rice and sandwiches and meat he prepped and froze was spoiled, which upset him as he claimed he bought it only a few days ago, and planned on eating it during our next few classes on lunch. She won out, ended up throwing it all away, but said it’s okay because he’ll have something prepped for the next classes. A few hours later, she tells me to prepare a few rice/meat bags in zip locks and sandwiches for him.

For one, he wouldn’t like it anyway. He counts calories and obsessively measures everything, even protein! And sauces! He tried to insist on measuring something while I prepared it for him but I couldn’t let that happen, I just made it, and if he really wanted it he’d just sit the fuck down and fucking eat it. 

Second, we had no meat, or rice. She decided to wait until 6 in the night to demand I drive out, buy chicken and rice, *cook rice*, and make food for my brother as if she didn’t just throw the food he already hoarded for himself away.

Third, there’s already food and snacks in the house he can prepare or prep from. The day before, or the day of. Like a normal person. Frozen Burgers, frozen French fries, franks, chips, cookies, pretzels, buscuits. he used to love at least half of these things (Especially fries) but he now eats them rarely if at all since this nonsense took him over.

I did, ultimately, go to the store to buy what she wanted and other stuff, she decides to claim she gave me money to buy it, giving him the green light to hoard a portion of it. 

He’s still very much pissed about what she did. But when I tried to tell him what he was doing was unfair he snapped back at me claiming he barely has time to study, walk, or workout if he doesn’t do this, and that I’ve been giving him too much shit over his body (Earlier this year, he weighed out to be 155lbs as a 5'8 man, which is admittedly tiny. He now weighs 140-something!) 

I admit he has a right to be angry about that last thing, but it just isn’t fair seeing food I do and don’t like taking up space like this, if I can’t take from it like everything else.

I said that I hoped she didn’t mean that, she remained silent.

So next week, it’s my turn to host the family dinner. At first I invited everyone, but I asked my brother if he wouldn’t bring his wife, since she’d rather die then sleep at my place. Now my brothers say I’m overreacting and that I should allow her to come anyways. I said I won’t allow anyone who talks to me like that in my house, without an apology. She doesn’t want to apologise.

We had plans to head back to campus together. But about a week before our trip, I got a call for a job interview in the same city as our college, scheduled for 3 days before we were supposed to leave. I asked HR if they could push it back, but they couldn’t.

I told my friend about it and suggested we move our trip up by 3-4 days. She seemed fine with it but said she had some things to sort out before booking. She also mentioned that if I couldn’t wait, I should go ahead and get my ticket.

I waited two days, but she still wasn’t ready. A day or two later, with just 4 days left before the interview, I tried contacting her again but couldn’t reach her. Since time was running out, I booked my ticket for 2 days before the interview. When we finally talked, she got super mad, saying it felt like I didn’t care whether she was coming or not, which wasn’t true. 

I told her she was overreacting and that I didn’t want to put pressure on her because she had a lot going on, and besides, she had already told me to book the ticket if I couldn’t wait. She then snapped and said, “Well, if I said that, then just go.” At that point, I got really frustrated and told her to F*&$ off. Now, she’s not responding to my calls or texts.

137,1fk6u6t,AITA - Girlfriend blames me for her unhappiness.,"Hello. First time posting something like this.

Me, M28 and my F25 have been toghether for 4 years. She is a determined person most of the time, or she likes to see herself as fully independent and capable of anything in any circumstance.
I am a calculated and somewhat of an old soul, that wants to ensure his future and build somethinf long lasting in a relationship, financial and emotional.

She had a breakdown, due to accumulated stress while we have been discussing my chronic disease(AS) which started with me voicing wanting to take a painkiller pill. She voiced her annoyance to me that, everytime it hurts I run to take a pill, which I do not, as I try to suffer the pain as much as possible until I have 3 or 4 nights of bad sleep or I am unable to sleep entirely.

The discussion got heated with me explaining why I feel like taking a pill as my pain is not going away, she went on a rant for not seeking treatment, in which case for AS, more than medical exercises, painmeds or biologicals, there is none. I explained that I refuse to go on bio, as they are expensive and very risky. She blew up, telling me I am not taking care of myself properly and I am never listening to her comments.( She knoes nothing of AS, as she did not bother to listen, nor research and disregarded my pain, basically referring to me as a pussy, who just overreacts).

I got pissed when everything was implied, as I took it personal, feeling disregarded and not mattering to her and from there the discussion became all about her unhappiness.

She voiced that, she did not want this type of life, she feels trapped and not being able to do what she wants

Context: she is a therapist for kids with autism, and the university and courses were paid by us, as her parents are not well of to pay for it. I took a loan to get us a car, as she had a car, but was tied to her abusive mother.

I tried to voice my feelings, but I was shut down fast, and overshadowed by her feelings that I never knew, even if we have open conversations, she trusts me enough to share shocking events in her youth, abuse and others stuff.

Now, I feel lost and feel like anything I have done was for nothing, as she sees herself better off without me, as I am holding her back.

Context: I have a fairly paid job, a self made career and can fully sustain myself. I work out at home boxing, i have some friend but not a lot(point that she made and attacked me on calling me antisocial), i loath fighting and conflicts with people I care about.

Am I the asshole? Am I good enough? Am I doing everything wrong without realising? 

I can take critique, so do not hold back in replies, honest opinions.

138,1fk6o1k,AITA for outing my brother at his wedding,"I (24F) and my brother (28M) have a mutual friend (25M) who we’ll call Jay, he has been my friend since Middle School and we all started hanging out Junior year of high school. Jay is a gay man and had a crush on my brother ever since they first met, my brother on the other hand was very vocal about being straight. 5 years ago he met his now ex-fiancé (27F) who we will call May. May is a sweet and stunning lady, and I don’t know how my brother bagged her, but I suppose miracles happen. Their “wedding” was 4 days ago, and I still feel a little bad. A day before the wedding me and Jay were hanging out and doing outfit prep, during this he went to the bathroom, and while he was in the bathroom he got a text from my brother, I was curious so I checked it out, and that’s how I found out that for the past 2 years my brother has been having an affair with Jay! (He proposed a year ago) It was late, and I didn’t know what to do, so I decided in the morning before the wedding I would confront my brother. When I confronted him, he told me that he wasn’t going to break off his affair because he was straight, so it wasn’t cheating. I should also mention that he told Jay that he got permission from May to have their “sex sessions”(this was a lie). My brother used Jays bad luck in finding partners and the fact he is crushing on him for his own pleasure, and I couldn’t stand for it. I was in shock. I wasn’t sure what to do, but when we were asked if there were any objections, I spoke up, I said that this couldn’t happen because my brother has been having an affair with Jay, and that he lied to Jay about what it was, he even told Jay not to tell anyone because he wasn’t out yet, when in truth he was just toying with him! After May and Jay both heard the truth they were distraught, May through her ring and ran out the wedding and Jay started balling. Now I’m getting flooded with texts, some saying I’m an asshole, some saying it wasn’t the right time, some saying I did the right thing. That’s not what I care about though. Jay is currently locked up in his apartment and won’t talk to anyone, expect the occasional thank you text for me bringing him food. My brother is furious. The one positive is that May thanked me and we have plans to go out for brunch Sunday. So Reddit, what do you think? I know I could’ve done some things better but I was overwhelmed and confused, am I the asshole? 
Edit: I should clarify that I didn’t say it was Jay that my brother was having an affair with, and the reason I didn’t tell May before was because I couldn’t reach her at the time. I have no good reason I couldn’t have spoken to Jay privately. I was just confused and taken aback. No excuses to be had.

Edit: To clarify my brother is still saying he is straight and using that as an excuse. He knows it was wrong or he wouldn’t have lied to Jay.

139,1fk66wy,WIBTA if i didn't invite one of my best friends to an event he'd eventually find out about.,"I have a friend who is south African but of Indian origin and he is one of my best friends.

I'm organizing an event for two of my other friends and their girlfriends as an opportunity for us all to get to know each other better. The other friend is single and has always been so.

Both my friends with gfs recently met their partners and became 'official' and really think they've met the one.

Because of this I don't want the single friend to potentially ruin it for them since there is probably a reason he has always been single.

I have been with my gf longer and he already knows her well so that's not an issue but she did hang out with one of my friend's gf's once and then another time when she was out with my Indian friend she ran into the other friends gf who initially thought he was harassing her.

Then when he went to the washroom they talked and she mentioned a lot of stuff about how she gets harassed by Indian men all the time in our city. (We live in Canada and there has been a recent influx of Indian migrants) my gf has also been harassed and cat called a lot at parks etc and a lot of white women are targets.

As a result I'm thinking of not inviting my friend as their relationships are new and I don't want to ruin anything for them. Of course later on I'll slowly introduce him if their gfs join our friend group.

I've always told her that she is welcome to rush but I cannot confirm or deny she will get in because I don't want to be accused of nepotism. My sister rushed this year and was doing well and a lot of my sisters really liked her and told me how much they like her. Since I know people will ask: I was not involved in her rush at all and let everyone know that anything to do with her I cant be involved in since I want to avoid my biases affecting her rush results, she was pledged without my help.

At an august charity event, my sister was one of the people who was there to set up. It was a heels race to raise money for a breast cancer foundation we frequently donate to. My sister ended up getting, I am not exaggerating, SHIT FACE DRUNK at this charity event and I got multiple complaints about her after the event because she threw up in front of a large group of people and then had to be dragged away crying. Someone from the fraternity we were doing the event with recorded her and posted it on Yikyak. It was like the Cassie hot tub scene from Euphoria. I had to leave the event early because of an emergency with my car and I didn't see the video or hear about it until the morning after. I called her into standards immediately. My sisters in charge of standards and the drop process let me know they had let her know that she would be meeting with me, and she had been MIA and not responding until she showed up to the meeting about 20 minutes late. 

This is where I feel bad. I told her that she was a fucking idiot for day drinking and being underage while at a literal breast cancer charity event. I basically just yelled at her and told her how this makes the entire sorority look particularly bad because she's the pres' younger sister. I told her she had to move out of the house, and she was dropped effective immediately. I was so pissed, I don't even remember all that I said, only that I yelled at her.

I do think that her behavior warranted her getting dropped, but I didn't set up any meetings to discuss with my sisters, and I didn't ask her what happened.

141,1fk62ji,AITA for calling my husband “pretentious” for reading everything in a museum and leaving him when travelling Europe?,"Throwaway account here because my husband follows my Reddit.

I (F29) am currently travelling around Europe with my husband (M32). We've planned this trip for a long time and so far it's been everything I could have wanted and more. I have one minor gripe though: my husband reads absolutely everything at every museum or gallery we visit.

We both appreciate culture and art, and I love immersing myself in a gallery as much as anyone, but my husband takes this to a whole new level. We go to an art gallery and he reads the art labels of every single piece. It's the same if we visit the museum; every single exhibit has to be examined in great detail. I wouldn't mind at all if it was the occasional piece as I do that myself when my interest is piqued, but he reads absolutely everything. I refuse to believe he has a genuine interest in every exhibit or painting, and we end up spending far too long in places, which impacts the rest of our trip.

I mentioned this to him, and he said he just wanted to maximise his enjoyment and immerse himself fully because we'd be unlikely to ever return. Although I told him I would appreciate it if we could hasten, nothing has changed.

After spending 4 hours in one gallery where we'd barely even scratched the surface, I said to him that we needed to quicken the pace and read less. Again, he replied that he was soaking it all in; due to my annoyance, I told him he was pretentious and did not have an interest in most of the things he was reading, and it was a means of appearing sophisticated and cultured.

He called me rude and said that it was as much his trip as it were mine and if I wanted to do something else, I was free to do so. At that stage, I had enough and left the gallery to go and wander around a nearby park. When he'd left the museum around 3 hours later and we ate together, it was strained; he told me I'd been unnecessarily hurtful and he was just appreciating these historic landmarks.

We apologised to each other but I feel maybe I was harsh.

142,1fk61r3,AITA for going against my parents ideas for my school project?,"hola, i (15M) and my parents are fighting a little (48F & 49M).

for some context, my school offers a programme where you learn more about life outside of school and try more things (like other subjects, etc).

one thing we do is that we have to make a mini-company and sell products/services at a trade fair. there are a couple of phases/stages we need to follow- September is idea generation, October/November is making your product and advertising, and December is selling.

i was originally going to do jam with my friend, but my mam said that i shouldn't as it'd be expensive and i wouldn't be able to help much. so i went on my own, and we did a couple of hours of research together coming up with ideas (roughly 3-5 hours). recently i came up with DIY Christmas ornaments, which my parents liked. however it looked very resource consuming to make them.

today, i was talking to my friend about the company thing and she said she was unsure if she was going to commit to hers or not (homemade sweets from her country) as her English isn't that great. i said i was unsure too on my idea, and later on that day i asked her if she wanted to work together on her company. she said yes and we're working together now (yay!).

i told my mam this today, after school. she was on a treadmill at the time, i told her about my day and how I'm now working with my friend. she sighed angrily, and told me to go away. as i was walking out she hit the remote off the treadmill table thing... i was confused on why she was so angry.

she finished up on the treadmill and came back in. and said to me ""can you list a reason why im mad about this?"" i said ""idk"" because... i didn't. she said that i basically stuck up the two fingers (alternate middle finger, im Irish ahaha) at them because i decided against their ideas and hours of research. i found it fair for her to be upset about that, so i stayed silent and just nodded. then she said how i was lazy for ""piggybacking"" off someone else's idea... which i found odd to say because i actually recommended to my friend to sell those sweets for her company (this was last week).

anyway, she basically said i would just be sitting there with her when we sell at the trade fair, which i disagreed on and said i would also help make them, package, etc. then she was still mad at me and she's been weird to me the whole day.

then... she sent my dad to text me (he's in another country currently), he asked what i decided to do for the company (my mam told him to text me). i told him that i was working with my friend and he acted surprised and a little annoyed. he said it was ""too late in the game"" to switch up like this... even though its literally the phase of idea generation and settling on what we're gonna do...

143,1fk5zrz,AITA for calling out my friend on how she treats the guy she’s talking to instead of being a supportive friend? ,"I (17F), have a friend (16F), who’s been talking to a guy seriously for the last month. They haven’t been talking for long but they hangout almost everyday, buy gifts for each other, and I know he likes her a lot. The guy she is talking to (16M) is quite innocent in the sense that he hasn’t really had any experience sexually or with relationships in the past. On the other hand, my friend has been with plenty of guys in the past for both relationships and sex. I think that because she is one of the first girls he’s ever talked to like this, he’s extremely attached to her and already wants to be with her. I know he’s very sweet and treats her very well, and she’s completely sure he’s being loyal to her. 

In the past, my friend had a tendency of talking to 3-5 guys at a time, but the way she was talking about him to me I assumed she was being loyal. I also know that she has assured him many times that she’s being loyal to him and has intentions to date him. This weekend it is his birthday as well as their one month talking anniversary. Though I do think it’s ridiculous to celebrate a month of talking, they’re going to exchange gifts and go on a date which I thought was wholesome. She’s also going to get him a birthday present and he asked her to spend his birthday together. 

I was very happy for her, until she told me that the day before his birthday she has plans to go over to a guys house and hookup with him. I was immediately shocked and asked why she’s doing this if she has a guy that she really likes who’s treating her well already. She told me she’s doing this because the guy she’s talking to is a virgin and she still wants to have sex. I told her that if not having sex is a dealbreaker for her she should just end it now, but then she told me that he wants to do it, they just both can’t have each other over to their houses. She also told me that she’s worried the sex with him will be bad since he has no experience, to which I told her again if he’s not going to fulfill her needs she should leave. I know she isn’t going to end their talking stage, so I told her it’s a shitty thing to do to a guy that obviously cares about her a lot and thinks she’s being loyal. She got quite defensive and seemed annoyed at me for saying anything about it because I don’t even know this guy and it shouldn’t matter. I explained to her that I only care because if this guy finds out, his feelings will definitely be hurt, and I also don’t trust her not to cheat on him if they do end up dating. She thinks that since I am her friend I should support her and stay out of her business rather than trying to tell her what to do. 

So, am I the asshole for trying to make my friend either leave the guy she’s talking to or stay loyal to him?

145,1fk4t53,AITA for not giving up a role in my schools play to another girl? ,"
I (15F) am a junior in high school and the cast list has just gone out for our schools fall drama. I'll be playing Emily in Our Town. It's the lead role. 

The thing is, I really like theatre and acting and seeing shows, but I consider it a hobby. I've got a few ideas for what I'd like to study in college but theatre isn't one of them. ""Sarah"" is a senior and she's absolutely going to study theatre in college. She is *furious* that I got the role instead of her. Said it was insane for a junior to get it instead of senior, she's more deserving, I only got it because she's more developed and mature. I have no idea what that means except for the fact that I'm kinda shrimpy and Emily is a young girl in the first act. So I guess it's a dig on my body. I heard this through some other kids, but Sarah did come directly to me today and tell me we should switch roles. She's playing Julia. Sarah was kinda nice at first when she spoke to me but got kinda rude at the end and told me I had better email the English teacher who's also the director, because I'm not an actress like she is.  

I don't want to switch. Even if she had been perfectly nice about it, I worked hard on my audition and we both tried out. I was just better than her, I guess. I don't even know if the director would allow it. At the same time, I'm starting to feel a little guilty. She does really want to be an actress. I'm also worried that the experience will be bad if I don't switch. The first cast meeting is this Friday. Should I do it? 

EDIT- Thanks for all the replies. You guys are right and I knew it deep down. I want this role and it's already mine. I'll speak with the director and let her know what Sarah's doing.

I met her through her brother who I played softball with in middle school, we hit it off pretty good and have been best friends since. That is until a music festival we both went to. We go every year, Ofc I wanted to go this year but couldn't afford it, so she offered to pay for my ticket and was the one who drove, paid for the hotel, and all the food to and from. I think she has a crush on me even though she's said she's aromantic and asexual, and says she sees me as an older brother (but why else would she be doing all that for me?), which i kinda like her too but might be weird since we've known each other for years and she just turned 18.   
The fest went fine, but I got upset a couple times (holding her drink when she went to the bathroom, watching the car while she checked into the hotel, these are not things I am responsible for.) and I could tell she knew I was upset about this things but never said sorry??? She also kept mentioning that I should try and save up if I want to go again next year because she had to pay for a lot. I understand i guess but why shame my financial situation when we're trying to go have fun? This made me feel kinda bitter the rest of the trip and after I got home I decided to give her the silent treatment. I told her I think we should stop being friends if she can't apologize, which i thought would make her realize her mistakes but instead she just said ""ok fine then"" ?? and now wants nothing to do with me.

148,1fk4l15,AITA for refusing to change my children's natural hair?,"I (35 f) am a mother of 4 kids (8 m, 5 f, 5 f and 3 f)
and am currently expecting my fifth. My husband and I are both of African descent and are quite dark skinned. We both have kinky hair and our kids all have very curly hair, especially our twins. 

The twins recently started school and they both quite enjoy it. People always complement their amazing hair and comment on how neat it looks. I live in a town that hasn't got any affordable coloured hair dressers so I cut their hair myself. I think that it's beautiful and I'm so happy that my girls love it too.

A few weeks into school, we had a parent-teacher conference. We knew our kids would be doing great and we didn't have anything to fear when going into the conference. 

We sat down in our chair and I noticed the teacher staring at our hair. I thought it was strange but shrugged it off and listened to the teacher talk about our girls. The report was great and we were so proud of them but just I was getting ready to leave, their teacher said she has one serious thing she wished to discuss. This made me and my husband concerned and we obviously sat back down.

When we sat down the teacher awkwardly looked at us and tried to explain without sounding racist. I don't remember her exact words but I think this was what she said.

""I have noticed both of you have beautiful hair and so do the girls. I'm sure it must be difficult to take care of but we were wondering if there's any way you could straighten it. Their hair can be quite distracting and I would hate for my other students to fall behind because of it.""

I tried to keep myself together. They were five years old! I was not putting heat on their hair just so some ""distracted"" kids wouldn't fall behind on the two times tables. I stared at my husband and saw him nodding along. This was the last straw for me. I was annoyed and immaturely started yelling (not loudly, just enough to make her understand my frustration).

""No! I will not be straightening my 5 YEAR OLDS hair. That is so bad for them and their hair is amazing! I don't want their healthy hair to die because of the other students. They won't be getting distracted by their hair and if THEY REALLY have a problem with it, tell them to talk to me themselves!"" 

I spoke before slamming my hands on the desk, grabbing my bag and leaving. 

Later, my husband got home. He yelled at me for embarrassing him infront of everyone and told me it wasn't a big deal if we straightened their hair. I was so mad but he kept insulting me, calling me swears and slurs. We kept arguing for hours and luckily my kids were at my ma's. Eventually, he slammed the door, locking the door behind him. Since he had locked it from the outside, I couldn't get out until he was back so I had to sleep on the uncomfortable chairs by the dining table. 

Anyways, AITA?


Edit: Thank you for all the support! Ive had a few people asking about the locked door and how it worked. Also there is a slight error in my part because i meant the outside table that we use for events and gatherings and also occasionally for breakfast when it's warm. When we were arguing, he was smoking and therefore spent a lot of the time outside. My door can't be unlocked without a key even when it's shut and my key had been inside since I had been home for a while. We only have two keys and it's never been an issue. When my husband went inside, he locked the door using his key. Therefore both keys were inside. The outside of the door doesn't have a handle and only has a piece of metal with a lock on it. Its easy to shut yourself out with doors like these as you need a key to open it even if its unlocked. I don't know if that's a great way to describe it but if you have the same doors, you'll know.

Me and my husband haven't spoken since the event and this will opbe the end of us. I'm looking into filing a report against that teacher and I have contacted my in-laws and they are on my side.

When my husband went inside, he locked the door using his key. Therefore both keys were inside. The outside of the door doesn't have a handle and only has a piece of metal with a lock on it. Its easy to shut yourself out with doors like these as you need a key to open it even if its unlocked. I don't know if that's a great way to describe it but if you have the same doors, you'll know.

Me and my husband haven't spoken since the event and this will opbe the end of us. I'm looking into filing a report against that teacher and I have contacted my in-laws and they are on my side. MIL has offered to look after the kids whenever we need while we sort things out and FIL is trying to talk to his son but apparently he won't drop it. I will update with further information.",0.0,0.0701858326792717,0,1
149,1fk4hdv,AITA for lying to baby daddy to give more?,"AITA for asking baby daddy to pay for half the price of after school my child doesnt go to anymore? My child had after school when my shift was in the morning. But when i switched to evening shift i took her out of after school and had my sister watch her until i get off and pick her up every night. I give my sister money every week for baby sitting and also for food. My baby daddy only gives me 88 a week i am not complaining at all but i am the custodial parent and provides everything for my child and what i mean is literally everything. He only buys his kid stuff when i oblige him to other than that its all me. He picks up the kid every weekend. He makes almost as much as me but he never disclosed in court the income he makes off the books. He doesn’t pay for any bills he lives rent free at his moms house while im the opposite. So AITA for asking him to continually pay half of the afterschool price my child stopped going to?

Update: i appreciate all your comments and opinions. I have told baby daddy that child is no longer going to after school but will pay child care to my sister instead at a lower cost just to cover for food and for my sister to earn a little extra income. So far baby daddy had chosen to ignore me. 🥲 but on a brighter note i feel much better that i dont have to lie anymore so thanks a lot for that everyone. ☺️",Asshole,2024-09-18,"AITA for lying to baby daddy to give more?

151,1fk4ak1,WIBTA if I didn’t share my inheritance with my siblings?,"I’m the youngest of 4 siblings, I’m not super close with them mainly due to age gap (my brother closest in age to me is 12 years my senior) but honestly have had a rocky relationship with the oldest two. My parents divorced when he left for college and I was about 6-7 and he was awarded custody of me. This is important because I spent most of my child life with my father and am much closer to him than I am my mother and other siblings, I do love her and them we just struggle to communicate effectively at times.

Due to the circumstances of my parents divorce they sort of took “her side” and it frayed our relationships. When he got sick I left school and did college from home to help him and take care of him, neither my mother nor my siblings helped at all. He passed last year and due to the magnitude of his assets the probate took a long time, a few weeks ago I received a call from his executor which is a family friend of ours and his lawyer letting me know I was the primary beneficiary of my fathers estate. In an off the record way he told me it was mostly in money, stocks and bonds, and that he had left just a few physical keepsakes to my other siblings.

I (stupidly) told my mother about this call just because I didn’t know who else to really talk about it with as it’s an incredibly life changing amount of money. She was able to receive a copy of the will through the courts as she was listed as one of the beneficiaries. She shared it with my siblings and all four of them have been borderline harassing me since they found out. Telling me that I better share it and that I’m a bad person and talking badly about my father. I’m not exactly sure when I should receive the money just that I definitely will be. My thoughts are if they didn’t care about my father when he was alive then why should they benefit from his death? It’s pretty obvious to me they only care about his money?

152,1fk49ay,AITA For wanting help with my daughter fron my parents?,"Just for reference, my parents are in a great financial situation. They are currently paying for my sister to go to nursing school at one of the best nursing schools in the state. They have gone on vacation after vacation, spring and summer. My whole life they have seem to favor my sister, I have not received any birthday presents since I was 18 and I’ve never asked them for money or received any while my sister has gotten as many as possible.

We are currently expecting our second child and my wife has extreme health risks. We have a five-year-old daughter and need somebody to watch her while my wife is either in birth or if it is an emergency C-section as it was with our first born. This because unfortunately her side of the family is far away or has health issues making them unable to care for a child. We have asked my parents to help us over the 3 to 4 days that would be needed. 
Now my parents have never invited us over unless my sister was coming over as well so my daughter has not seen them on a weekly or even monthly basis. We know this is a big ask however they are not sure about making a decision to cancel a vacation (just camping so nothing paid) over a weekend for the c section date if she comes late,however they are continuing to vacation the week before as well and she could still give birth anyday now. They are currently out of the area even though she could give birth any minute. I might be overreacting, but this seems extremely irresponsible and uncaring to not be available for something that you had said you would do months ago. They won’t even give us a straight answer if she can spend the night which would mean I would need to leave my wife and newborn alone in the hospital while she’s already undergoing complications. The original conversation was to have my daughter spend the night over for the 3/4 nights so that I would be able to properly care for both my wife and newborn and to pick her up as we taking her home from the hospital . Suddenly they are not sure about when they will even be home or if they even want her to be sleeping over I just don’t know what to do. It makes me upset. I don’t know if this is a normal parent relationship or if something has gone wrong I’m just trying to figure out. I’m done being disappointed even when the bar set so low. Again, I understand that a few days overnight is a very big ask, but I would not think twice if my Sister had a child and I had to watch them for weeks or months even if the timing was not perfect. It is either that they do not want my child to stay overnight, they simply don’t want to be involved in my child’s life or they simply just want to vacation . 
I just need to know am I the asshole? I know that its hard to care for a child and its their choice to be part of our lives but i feel like being mad and upset with them may not be justified.
