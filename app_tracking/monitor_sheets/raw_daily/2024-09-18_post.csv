0,1fju09l,AITA for reporting my classmates to the principal?,"I (trans man,18) was at a school event before school started. Some of my classmates ages 17-18 were there, and one of them pulled out a can of alcohol. The student who pulled it out drank all of it in one go. It was only 6:49 in the morning. At around 7:18 everyone decided to go up to school. 

The student who drank, drove a few people up to the school. I got a ride from someone else. We arrived at school around 8, and school starts at 9:15. Since nobody was in the school at the time myself and a few other students dropped our stuff in the main office. We then walked up to a park to join a few other classmates.

When I got to the park, one student had pulled out a bong and started to pass it around. I said no due to health reasons. There were only six of us there, including myself. They all got pretty high but I stayed sober. I skipped first period to make sure that they didn't do anything stupid/get hurt. 

We arrived back at school during the beginning of second period. I walked down from the park while two students from the group who smoked drove the others down.

Later during the day I went to the principal and told her about what happened. She said that she was proud of me for looking out for my fellow students, but disappointed that I was the one to report it. I'm now being eaten from the inside by guilt and shame. 

So am I the asshole for reporting fellow classmates to the principal?",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-09-18,"AITA for reporting my classmates to the principal?

1,1fjscoy,AITA for not thinking about how a gender affirming haircut would affect my family?,"I(16, transgender ftm) am living with my mom(45) in Germany, and have a dad(48) who is in Ukraine. They are together, but we moved because of the war and he isn't allowed to do so because of mobilization.Â 

Before everything, I want to specify that I am closeted but bad at hiding things, including my blog, so my parents know about me being trans. They are extremely transphobic and homophobic and I've been openly a part and huge activist of LGBT community since I was 10, so the environment in family definitely isn't good.

My dysphoria has been really bad recently and I know that something as simpleÂ Â as masculine haircut can really improve my wellbeing. I asked my mom about it, specifying that it would be a really short one and she agreed, but I caught a cold so we had to delay everything.Â 

I have my birthday on autumn break in around a month and my mom booked tickets to go visit my dad in Ukraine, which means that I would need to celebrate it there. I wasn't thrilled about this idea as none of my friends are there, but I love my father and miss my country, so agreed on it. My plan was to get my haircut before it so I can feel more comfortable and have some pictures there I resemble myself more.Â 

Now that I am no longer sick, I showed my mom a picture of what I want(an undercut) to specify with my hairstylist if she can do that. I am unable to contact her without my mom as I don't have a smartphone(yes, at 17, that's a whole another story). I thought it was settled as my mom knew and previously agreed on everything, but she suddenly started to scream at me, calling me ""it"" and telling me that ""my dad wouldn't want to introduce you to anyone as his daughter if you're gonna look insane"". I tried to explain that it would make me feel a lot better about myself and it's something that we've attempted before(around 2 years ago I had an awful pixie cut cause hairdresser didn't want to make me look too ""boy-ish""). She started calling me ""it"", and told me that this would defeat the whole purpose of going to Ukraine as it would only make my dad feel worse, as ""If he would need to go to war, what would he have to fight for? Your gay parades? Have you even thought about how we would feel?"" so I had to apologize and give up on the idea. 

 I told my friends about this situation and they sided by me, but I think that I kinda was in the wrong here for not thinking about my dad's feelings about all of it and my mom just couldn't control her emotions as she cares about him deeply.
