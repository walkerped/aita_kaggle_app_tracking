0,1fkv81x,AITA: asking my parents to allow my partner upstairs?,"Edit: Thank you for all of the replies. Maybe I should have posted in a different sub because my goal was to answer the question ‚Äúshould a 13yo and a 19yo have the same house rules‚Äù. Like i said in this post, this is not about sex. This is about me having a private place to talk to my boyfriend about things my siblings don‚Äôt care to hear. 

Also I dont ever speak to my parents as bluntly as that, I have you my internal thoughts version and what I said to them was firm, but not disrespectful. I explained somewhere in the comments.

There are other problems that we have as a family dynamic that I didn‚Äôt mention simply because it‚Äôs irrelevant to the post. This is just one of them. My only goal was to attempt to rationalize their feelings because my parents both never elaborated.

Conclusion? I‚Äôm not the asshole for asking, I probably shouldn‚Äôt have said how I was feeling, and I will be the asshole if I bring it up again.üëçüèº",Asshole,2024-09-19,"AITA: asking my parents to allow my partner upstairs?

1,1fkv3pl,AITAH for refusing to talk to my friends,"I (18F) and 5 of my friends all the same age expect for one who is (16F).I have been on this friend group for a few years and have really grown close to them , there are some instances where I felt left out but I always ignored it

So when they decided to plan a sleepover where all six of us would over to one of our houses for a sleepover. I was really excited. So we all immediately went to my friend (18F)'s parents to asked for permission to have the sleepover at her house. 

The youngest was the one we all decided would ask for permission. But when she asked for permission she only stated that four of us would be coming despite there being six people. Her parents agreed to have the sleepover and it was dated a week later. They were supposed to send a message to my mom stating that there would be a sleepover and that I was invited but a whole week passed and I did not get a message. The next time i saw them, they were all busy talking about how fun the sleepover would be. When I asked them what was going on and why I didn't get an invite to the sleepover, they simply just implied that I said I did not want to go. I was very confused by this because I said no such thing. Until another member of the friend group (18F) pointed out that the both of us were never really involved in the group and also the reason why she mentioned that only 4 people were going to the sleepover instead of 6. When I asked my so called friends when I said I didn't want to go to the sleepover they told me that they just assumed I didn't want to go. That did it for me.

They did apologise it has been a long time since it happened and I have forgiven them. But it still hurts sometimes. They still did the sleepover with just the four of them and they seemed really excited for it just to be the four of them  either way. It is almost as if the two of us werent even meamt to be part of the sleepover                                    

I feel like they could have definitely communicated with me about this but they didnt.

5,1fku9bc,AITA for not getting my family something to drink from the store?,"I (24) put my water bottle and a soda away in the fridge so I could have something to drink after school while I studied. Before coming home, I grabbed some free burritos and tacos from outside. Upon arrival, I discovered that both the water and soda I had put away were gone.

I went into my mother‚Äôs room, where both she (60) and my sister (28) were sitting and talking. I asked them about my beverages, and my mother revealed that she had drunk them both. We‚Äôre a family on public assistance, so I playfully complained about my drinks before asking for the SNAP card to go to the store and buy myself some drinks. Before I left, they asked me to retrieve more burritos. I went to the store, but sadly, there were no more free burritos left.

After returning and putting my drinks in the fridge (three $1 Arizona drinks), my mom came out shortly and checked what I had put away. She then proceeded to lecture me, telling me that I was selfish, that I got that trait from my father‚Äôs side of the family, and that I should have been mindful of everyone and gone to the supermarket to buy larger drinks so that everyone could have something to drink.

Being called selfish set me off. I shouted that everyone had heard me say I was going to the store and that they had no problem asking me to pick up more burritos and that If they wanted something to drink, they should have just told or asked me. After a little back-and-forth arguing, my sister revealed that she had gone to the store earlier and got Mom and herself another water bottle, completely disregarding me.

While I understand that I could've been mindful, none of them want to take accountability for the fact that they could've just asked me to go to the supermarket. Either way, AITA?

Small Edit: a lot of people are under the impression that money is extremely tight because I put that we are on public assistance, while yes we can‚Äôt afford to go willy-nilly on just whatever, $3-$8 spent at the convenience store isn‚Äôt going to put us in the red. Yes we are on public assistance but we do receive enough each month to eat proper meals, I really just wanted something sweet to study with.

Also, my original water bottle that mom drank, I had that saved for a while now, it just wasn‚Äôt opened until today.

9,1fktd45,AITA for coming to my brother's wedding with an invitation? ,"Hello reddit. I (33M) recently attended my younger brother's (31) wedding, and I'm struggling with something that happened there. I'm aware that reaching out to the internet for advice isn't always the best decision, but I realized this issue involves a lot of personal bias and feelings within my family, which is why I could use some outside perspective.

A little backstory: My brother and I didn‚Äôt have the best relationship growing up. I wasn‚Äôt a good older brother to him or our other siblings, and part of that was because I was an immature, insecure kid who targeted my brother specifically a lot. In fact, I was downright awful to him at times. We come from a conservative family, and while that‚Äôs not an excuse, it was part of why I behaved the way I did. This didn't change until we were both adults, but I‚Äôve since grown up, realized how wrong I was and solved out some internalized problems. I have apologized to him several times over the past few years. He‚Äôs been polite, but things have been distant. I only see him on special occasions like family birthdays and holidays, but even those are rare.

A few months ago, I got an invitation to his wedding, which surprised me. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him about it, but after talking with my sister, I decided to go. It felt rude not to. At the wedding, I mostly spent time catching up with family, and after a while, I went to say hi to my brother when I saw him at the gift table.

That‚Äôs when things took a turn. Before I could even get a word out, he already looked uncomfortable. We exchanged the usual pleasantries, but there was this underlying tension I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. Then, out of nowhere, he told me he hadn‚Äôt wanted me there at all. He said that while his husband had insisted on inviting me, he himself wasn‚Äôt ready to have me at such an important event in his life and that I should've known that. I was stunned. I didn‚Äôt know what to say and was embarrassed. The conversation ended awkwardly. Feeling embarrassed and unwelcome, I left the wedding early and spent the rest of the day overthinking everything.

It‚Äôs been a few days, and I haven‚Äôt contacted my brother since. My other family members are split, with some saying maybe I should‚Äôve known better. I‚Äôm unsure if I should reach out to him or just give him space. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt understand why he feels the way he does, but at some point, I feel like his resentment is making things worse. It‚Äôs putting our family in this awkward position where people start taking sides, and it feels like I‚Äôm constantly being judged for something I‚Äôve already apologized for multiple times. I don‚Äôt want our family to keep seeing me as the person I used to be, because that‚Äôs not who I am anymore.

So, AITA for attending his wedding when I was invited, but apparently not welcome?

I wasn‚Äôt a good older brother to him or our other siblings, and part of that was because I was an immature, insecure kid who targeted my brother specifically a lot. In fact, I was downright awful to him at times. We come from a conservative family, and while that‚Äôs not an excuse, it was part of why I behaved the way I did. This didn't change until we were both adults, but I‚Äôve since grown up, realized how wrong I was and solved out some internalized problems. I have apologized to him several times over the past few years. He‚Äôs been polite, but things have been distant. I only see him on special occasions like family birthdays and holidays, but even those are rare.

A few months ago, I got an invitation to his wedding, which surprised me. I hadn‚Äôt spoken to him about it, but after talking with my sister, I decided to go. It felt rude not to. At the wedding, I mostly spent time catching up with family, and after a while, I went to say hi to my brother when I saw him at the gift table.

That‚Äôs when things took a turn. Before I could even get a word out, he already looked uncomfortable. We exchanged the usual pleasantries, but there was this underlying tension I couldn‚Äôt quite put my finger on. Then, out of nowhere, he told me he hadn‚Äôt wanted me there at all. He said that while his husband had insisted on inviting me, he himself wasn‚Äôt ready to have me at such an important event in his life and that I should've known that. I was stunned. I didn‚Äôt know what to say and was embarrassed. The conversation ended awkwardly. Feeling embarrassed and unwelcome, I left the wedding early and spent the rest of the day overthinking everything.

It‚Äôs been a few days, and I haven‚Äôt contacted my brother since. My other family members are split, with some saying maybe I should‚Äôve known better. I‚Äôm unsure if I should reach out to him or just give him space. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt understand why he feels the way he does, but at some point, I feel like his resentment is making things worse. It‚Äôs putting our family in this awkward position where people start taking sides, and it feels like I‚Äôm constantly being judged for something I‚Äôve already apologized for multiple times. I don‚Äôt want our family to keep seeing me as the person I used to be, because that‚Äôs not who I am anymore.

So, AITA for attending his wedding when I was invited, but apparently not welcome?

13,1fkr5wl,AITA for what i said over text,"I (29F) and my husband (30M) have a child (2F) who I'll call Amy. He is typically very busy with work. I sleep downstairs with our child, while he sleeps upstairs. He has a flight today, and last night I had asked him what time he's leaving to the airport and he said probably around 8am but he wasn't sure. I said ""Amy and I may not be awake before you leave then"", and he said ""that's ok, I'll see you when I get back on Sunday.""

So this morning at 8:15 I woke up and did not hear anything upstairs so I thought he had left already. The following is our text exchanges this morning.

Me (8:16am): I'm gonna do 9-11 on Sunday. I won't be loud but Amy will be awake by 9 and she may be loud? Are you ok with it?

Me (8:16am): Well she will be awake regardless of me working lol

Me (8:16am): But ya, u ok with me doing 9-11?

Him (8:17am): Sure that is fine, 9-11am

Me (8:17am): Ok

Me (8:17am): By the time I finish work you will prob be awake.

Me (8:17am): And then we can do something fun Sunday.

Me (8:17am): Hmm like what tho? What fun thing?

Me (8:19am): What are we doing Sunday? Anything fun? Haha

Me (8:25am): :(

Me (825am): I may as well work all day if we're not doing anything

Him (8:28am): Fine

Me (8:28am): :(

Me (8:28am): No fun

So afterwards I went upstairs with Amy, and I saw him in his room packing still. I was surprised because I thought that he left already. He ignored me, didn't even look at me. I asked him if he's upset about something, and he said yes he's tired of me starting the day off by complaining. I was surprised by his reaction and told him that all I wanted was to hang out with him on Sunday, and then I left the room.

To clarify, I thought that he was in an uber on his way to the airport at the time of messaging. And he had responded right away when I initially messaged him. So when he didn't respond after I asked about doing anything fun on Sunday, I thought that he was avoiding the question because he didn't want to hang out. He is typically very busy with work so I thought he would prefer to work instead.

From his point of view, he was still packing at home and did not have his phone at hand. He said he was busy packing while also troubleshooting an issue with the flight, and that I didn't even bother waiting for his response.

I explained my POV to him. He said that I assumed incorrectly and created another argument, and that this whole thing started because of me. He wants me to apologize for complaining and starting this fight. He says I am ""100% at fault"" and that I ""assumed incorrectly and started an argument by complaining‚Äù. I told him that my response wasn't even a complaint, and at most it was slight passive aggressiveness when I told him that I may as well work all day if we aren't hanging out.

Since then, He has had our daughter (2f) 3 times. The first two times, he had her for a long weekend (about 4 days) and the last time, he had her for 3 weeks, which was last two weeks in August and first week of September. I constantly asked for her back because I had gotten my weeks mixed up and didnt realize it was such a long stretch, and he kept saying no.

Since l've gotten her back, he's asked for 2 calls a day, like he gave me when he had her. While I understand he needs to be able to talk to her, I have been the one to take care of her since she was born, and she has attachment issues with me. She hates getting on the phone when we call him and often walks away from the phone. It takes me a while to get her interested in the call, and I can't always do calls as I'm super busy myself. I work from home, go to college, and have two other kids and I'm also in the process of moving so moving between two houses at the current moment cleaning working on them etc. so I can't always do one call a day, much less two.

Multiple calls recently, after I finally get her interested in the call, he is texting because I can see he is unfocused and his phone is moving back and forth. Our two year old is hard enough to get focused on the call, and with him hardly having had her, I think he needs to focus on her. I have called him out for it multiple times, and this is like the fifth time I have caught him doing it. I can always tell when it happens, because our daughter gets visibly upset at being ignored.

The last time was a couple days ago. She was sticking her tongue out, looked visibly upset and turned around to her show. When I flipped the phone around and noticed he was texting, I told him whomever he wants to text can wait until he is done talking to his daughter. I hardly have time to give him a call these days, and him taking them for granted is not appreciated. He said I was overreacting, and that it's the same thing as me rejecting my son (7m) when he asks to play video games after l've already tucked him into bed. I told him if I catch him texting when he's on a video call with her again, I will no longer be doing calls, as it's hard enough for me to find time to do them and I will not allow my daughter to be ignored when I do find time.

It isn't like he doesn't have time to text when he's not on the phone with our daughter. He doesn't work (gf and sister pay the bills) he doesn't support our daughter (they live in sec 8 housing and I supply everything she needs at both houses) and he isn't in college (dropped out while we were together).

I‚Äôm also one of two people with my license in the friend group.

I‚Äôve never been invited to anything like this before and I‚Äôm really excited. Our whole group got invited as well but Anna decided not to go. I‚Äôm gonna be the DD so I‚Äôm not drinking.

Anyways after Anna decided not to go my other friend made a snap group chat with everyone who‚Äôs gonna be in my car just so we can like coordinate. Anna saw me texting and asked why we have a GC without her and I told her it‚Äôs just for the game and the party.

18,1fkqena,AITA for lying about the extent of my eating disorder after my flatmate found my bags of chewed up food? ,"I (21F) have struggled with disordered eating for years but hidden it.

Recently I moved in with a friend (23F). Part of me really wanted to do this, but I was reluctant because if I had binge eating episodes she'd almost certainly notice, and I'm so embarassed about it. Like the amount of food I can get through in a binge is insane. Then I'll usually restrict after a binge (yes I know that just causes another one...).

I couldn't tell her the actual reason I was reluctant to move in with her, so it caused tension. I said something vague about not being sure if I'd be a good flatmate which she said was bs because we've known each other for years, so she thought I must have an issue with her I wasn't telling her. 

Since we moved in together my eating habits have improved- we cook dinner together, and I don't often feel like shutting myself in my room and binging. But this isn't an issue that goes away overnight, so if I binge I've started chewing food up and spitting it in a bag. I know this is still bad, but it doesn't feel as bad as before as I don't feel like I have to restrict afterwards, so I can still eat normally with my flatmate. I also get satisfied faster. I hide the bag in my room, then add it to the food waste when I take the rubbish out. 

Last week I came home drunk after a night out, and for some reason decided to take the bins out. I took the chewed bags from my room to add, but drunk me then forgot and left them on the table.

My flatmate found them in the morning and was disgusted. I tried to say it was puke, she knew I was lying. (Idk what it says about me that there's a more embarassing explantion than leaving puke bags lying around). She said she didn't get why I was lying or what was going on, so in the end I just told her the truth, I've got an eating disorder.

She was still disgusted by the bags, but also annoyed when she realised how much I've been hiding the issue, while we were planning to move in together and a lot of times over the years when I've cancelled plans and insisted everything's fine. She said I should have got help ages ago or just told her and she would have tried to help. She also said that she's always been open about her mental health issues to me and feels upset that I didn't have the same trust in her. This all ended with her saying that I either need to get help or move out. Which seems extreme to me, I get that the bags were gross but we haven't had any other issues living together and I fully intend for that to be a one time thing. I also just feel so ashamed about her knowing about my ED. I really do think it's been getting better, so having to talk to someone about it just seems like a waste of time and more embarassment.

This happened yesterday, I went for a walk and my flatmate and I haven't spoken since. I really wish this never happened but I want to fix the friendship. So, AITA?

23,1fknxhr,WIBTAH for not giving up my bed to a friend in order for her to come to my birthday ? ,"Hello dear redditors. 

I'm here to here your judgement about the following situation. 

I (36F) have been friend with Clara (36F) for a little bit more than 10 years. It's my first adult friends, we were neighbors when we met. 

We live approx 2.50 hours away from each other's house and we rarely see each other (4 times a year max, mainly 2-3) 

This Saturday, I host at my parent's place a gathering of closed friends to celebrate my 36 birthday. hen I told her about the date (always the first weekend after my actual bday), she told me she was so glad to come, that she misses me, etc (last seen on July when I came to her place). She told me that her BF (let's call him Logan) would comme too, as he was of work in order to have a surgery a few days after the party. 

She told me ""but as Logan is going to have a surgery and his knee is bad, he have priority to choose any seating he prefers"". I agree. 

When they come, they usually sleep into the guest room and I sleep into my parent's room when it's packed (like at every birthday of mine). This year, my parents are gonna be here, so I'm planning on sleeping on the guest rooms (the others rooms are all booked by my other friends) and I told her that she will have to sleep in my old room, wich has no real bed but two nice mattress on a slatted bed at floor level. 

She started to tell me that it's gonna be hard for her because of her back (her back always hurts, mainly because of her obesity - no judgement here, just a fact) and Logan's knee ; that's she couldn't take the risk to block her back after his surgery. She also played the guilt card by telling me her son (my ""godson"") will be disappointed as he was talking about it all week. 

The point is that I don't want to give her my bed. Why ? Because I'm tired of always giving them everything they ask for. For example, 3 years ago, I was on my 8.5 months of pregnancy, and she offered to come to my parents house in order to help me keep my eldest busy (she was 2 at the time). She came, alone, no kids of her own yet (just found out she was pregnant). And she asked for my bed, because her back hurt so much. 
So I, with a gigantic belly, and all the inconveniences of the end of a pregnancy, left my bed and slept on the mattress. 

Today I fell that it's too much, the fact that I dislike her BF adds to the fact that I don't want to ""sacrifice"" myself another time, even if that means they are not coming.

25,1fkmhmg,AITA FOR CHOOSING MY MOM OVER MY DAD?,"I (30F) choose to leave my dad (70M) to go back to take care of my sick mom(61F)?

To give context, I grew up with my mom in Asia. My dad and mom are in a long distance relationship. They were never married but my dad has always showered me with everything I want and need. I lived with a gold spoon on my mouth and never really struggled. I graduated 2019 and passed my board exam in my home country but the salary for my occupation wasn‚Äôt really that high. My dad suggested I come work in the us, but in order to do that, I have to study for a few more years because of the different curriculum. My mom, knowing I‚Äôll have more opportunities in the US, agreed.

My life in the US was nice. I get to experience the other half of me. The culture I never really experienced. My dad paid for college and my apartment, he also gave me allowance because he wanted me to focus on my school work instead of working part time. He‚Äôs a really good dad and sometimes I feel like I don‚Äôt deserve him. 

During the pandemic, my mom has acquired kidney failure and has to undergo dialysis. This broke my heart knowing that I am far away when she‚Äôs sick; I am an only child so knowing she‚Äôs dealing with that all alone pains me. Even going against my dad‚Äôs wishes, I did part time jobs to send my mom money because her treatments and medication costs a lot of money. 

Fast forward to August of this year, my mom‚Äôs condition worsened. She was in and out of the hospital and started vomiting blood. She only had a caregiver next to her and I couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of her not having me next to her. So I told my dad I was going home.

At this point, I have already graduated in an American university and was getting ready to take the board exams. 

My dad got mad at me saying I don‚Äôt belong in the Philippines and that I should just start working instead of going back. He even threatened to cut me off if I leave for my home country. I have saved a lot through the years of part time and not having to pay for my apartment so I had money for the plane ticket and my living expenses for a few months. 

My dad didn‚Äôt understand why I had to leave. He knows what happened to my mom and it really disappoints me he cared so little of her. 

So, my dad never agreed of me leaving, but I knew I was running out of time. I booked the first flight home. 

Now my dad‚Äôs blowing up my phone, calling me ungrateful and stupid to be leaving all of it behind. 

So was going home without his approval makes me an asshole? I‚Äôm 30 years old but in Asia or in the country I grew up in,  it doesn‚Äôt matter how old a child gets, parents always have to be right, so it‚Äôs making me feel guilty.

26,1fkm8i6,AITA for being the bridesmaid and not going to my brother's wedding?,"

My older brother is 25 and is getting married. He asked me to be the maid of honor at the wedding and I accepted, making it clear that he invited me almost a year in advance. My maternal grandmother is the sweetest and most caring human being I know, but the wedding is only a week away and she still hasn't been invited, so I decided not to go to the wedding if she wasn't invited.

Context: Our mother died 10 years ago (I was 11 at the time and my brother was 15). Since then, we have been distancing ourselves from our maternal family due to lack of time. However, I have been getting closer to my mother's family for about 2 years now. However, my brother has not had any contact with us for almost 5 years. My grandmother always makes it clear how much she misses him and that she loves him, and that she would like to see him more often. She also always asks about the wedding (I mentioned to her that he was getting married). The wedding is in a week and no one from my mother's family has been invited. It is obvious that my grandmother is upset about not having been invited yet and about missing my brother, since her grandchildren remind her of her own daughter who died (my mother). I announced in the family group that I would not go to the wedding until my grandmother invited me and I told my brother that he was a bad person, he got very angry with me and we fought, he agrees with me that he is wrong, but he does nothing to change.

My dad got upset and said if money was the issue why didn't my finance and I accept his offer to assist with wedding costs? He said that I was being selfish and that we are still family even though we didn't grow up together.

32,1fkj4cs,WIBTA for confronting my mom on her behavior toward me lately?,"
Currently struggling with my parents‚Äô expectations of how much they see my baby/their role as grandparents. I‚Äôm not sure how to help them manage their expectations, but I feel like low key resentments are building. Example: My mother freaked out on me because I went to celebrate my friend‚Äôs birthday a few Sundays ago, and said I would be a bit late to Sunday dinner. Her reply: ‚Äújust don‚Äôt come at all.‚Äù With ‚Äúexcuse me for trying to make a tradition.‚Äù (She sees the baby throughout the week, not just on Sundays).

I feel like having a baby has brought out a strange side to my mother that I was not prepared for. On one hand it has made us closer, but on the other, I feel like there is a weird level of needing/wanting control, subtle criticism, throwing my irrational first time mom anxieties in my face, comments of not seeing the baby enough, guilt tripping me, going against my requests of not doing something etc. (example, she fed her sugary cake behind my back after knowing I said no sugar until her first birthday cake. Literally knew not to and did it anyways).

A few weeks ago we got into a little spat and she made a comment to me that I use the baby as a pawn‚Äîwhich could not be further from the truth. I haven‚Äôt asked her to elaborate because I‚Äôve been so hurt over it. The only thing I can come up with is that she doesn‚Äôt like that I have boundaries surrounding the baby. 

My mom never seems to give me any compliments or positivity. I shouldn‚Äôt be searching for validation, but it would be nice if my own mother could tell me I‚Äôm doing a good job sometimes? Be my biggest cheerleader in life not my biggest critic??! She‚Äôs ALWAYS making subtle jabs. There‚Äôs always some jokey comment about me and it‚Äôs just gotten completely frustrating as I have started to notice the way other moms talk about their daughters/ support them. Small example, We both ironically made banana bread the other morning, her immediate response: ‚Äúmines better.‚Äù Like??? I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of *humorless* humor anymore. It‚Äôs also not lost on me that she‚Äôs only hanging out with me 1:1 now that the baby is here. This wasn‚Äôt really the case before. 

Essentially ‚Äî I‚Äôm struggling with my relationship with my mom, and my eyes are open to a lot of aspects of our relationship that I actually don‚Äôt like. I guess this is a hard situation to explain in full, but I wanted to see if anyone else has been in this position, and how you navigated it..

Her reply: ‚Äújust don‚Äôt come at all.‚Äù With ‚Äúexcuse me for trying to make a tradition.‚Äù (She sees the baby throughout the week, not just on Sundays).

I feel like having a baby has brought out a strange side to my mother that I was not prepared for. On one hand it has made us closer, but on the other, I feel like there is a weird level of needing/wanting control, subtle criticism, throwing my irrational first time mom anxieties in my face, comments of not seeing the baby enough, guilt tripping me, going against my requests of not doing something etc. (example, she fed her sugary cake behind my back after knowing I said no sugar until her first birthday cake. Literally knew not to and did it anyways).

A few weeks ago we got into a little spat and she made a comment to me that I use the baby as a pawn‚Äîwhich could not be further from the truth. I haven‚Äôt asked her to elaborate because I‚Äôve been so hurt over it. The only thing I can come up with is that she doesn‚Äôt like that I have boundaries surrounding the baby. 

My mom never seems to give me any compliments or positivity. I shouldn‚Äôt be searching for validation, but it would be nice if my own mother could tell me I‚Äôm doing a good job sometimes? Be my biggest cheerleader in life not my biggest critic??! She‚Äôs ALWAYS making subtle jabs. There‚Äôs always some jokey comment about me and it‚Äôs just gotten completely frustrating as I have started to notice the way other moms talk about their daughters/ support them. Small example, We both ironically made banana bread the other morning, her immediate response: ‚Äúmines better.‚Äù Like??? I just can‚Äôt deal with this type of *humorless* humor anymore. It‚Äôs also not lost on me that she‚Äôs only hanging out with me 1:1 now that the baby is here. This wasn‚Äôt really the case before. 

Essentially ‚Äî I‚Äôm struggling with my relationship with my mom, and my eyes are open to a lot of aspects of our relationship that I actually don‚Äôt like. I guess this is a hard situation to explain in full, but I wanted to see if anyone else has been in this position, and how you navigated it.. I‚Äôm not sure if I should let things go, voice my feelings, etc. but I feel like I‚Äôm always walking on egg shells.

This blended family thing is pretty new still with my dad being remarried for 2 years. My mom died so I only have one home. And I'll be honest I was never excited or really into the whole blended family thing. But I know that's not my decision.

All three of my stepsiblings have food allergies, two have bad ones. So the way we eat changed a lot. This included places we eat at that were a part of traditions. For most of my life we'd eat at this local noodle bar in town for the end of the school year and whenever we had a school thing (play, graduation, report card, etc) and we're not allowed to go there anymore because of the allergies. Even just with dad it's a no go. We can't bring ice cream into the house anymore because my stepsiblings can't eat it. Only my dad and his wife can prepare food so no more making a sandwich for myself either.

Birthdays have changed. My sister and I can no longer eat at our preferred restaurant of choice because of my stepsiblings and we can't bring my favorite dish into the house either. So now it's a place that my stepsiblings love and ""is acceptable"" for their allergies. For two years dad has talked about how glad we are to make all these changes and how family is worth it.

About four months ago his wife noticed my sister and I weren't engaged with ""the family"" in the way she thought we'd be. We didn't want to talk to her. She also noticed my sister had cut me and her out of some photos of all of us and used just me and her for her room's art wall. So she and dad decided we needed some family therapy.

And my dad has also talked about all the good from a blended family and changes were mentioned and he talks about how happy we all are to make them. Well, last week I got so sick of it and the therapist asked me if I was truly okay with them. And I went off. I said no I'm not. That I hate the changes. That it's unfair.

My mum (before she was sick) has always wanted me to get married since she found out I was dating. She is an Asian and a conservative Christian‚Äîjust a lovely combination for a highly-controlling-and-having-absolutely-no-boundary type of parent. I am not religious anymore (My mum is not aware) and my boyfriend is an atheist. We have been constantly pressured to convert my boyfriend to Christianity (This is a whole other problem we're facing). She said she would only approve when my boyfriend get baptised. We always have to shut off the comment by lying about going to church every Sunday and saying he would get baptised one day. Heck, from all the unnecessary pressure, we even planned to elope if we ever got married.

But the situation changed, recently my mum's condition got even worse. The cancer is spreading even more and she is deteriorating.

She didn't even tell them about me for several years and then used a 6 year old me to break the news to them. Then not only did she use me to break the news but she had me ask them if we could stay there for a while and she coached me to do the puppy dog eyes and ""make it good"". I did all that because she asked and I was 6. When she wanted me to lie about my father, I did. When she wanted me to lie about where we'd lived before, I did. I did everything she asked. I followed her along eagerly, for the most part, when she was bouncing between guys and putting those relationships before me. I even shared a room with a random baby and toddler when I was 8 because mom's then boyfriend only had one extra room where his kids slept.

I tried to speak up once about wanting mom to focus more on me. She figured out what I was going to say and gave me this guilt trip about needing to be put first because she had me so young and how she needed me to get on board. So I never tried again.

Four years ago she met her husband and dated him online when Covid kept everyone at home. They moved in together 3 years ago and got married 2 weeks after we moved in together. It was him, his three kids and mom and me. His kids spent some time with their mom but were with us a lot too. I hated it honestly but for mom, I said nothing. She put more effort into his kids than she did to me and it stung, a lot. They were younger but so fucking what. I was still her kid too. She treated me more like an older sister by burdening me with her issues and asking me for ""help"" with them. So I started spending more time with my grandparents and started to thrive. 

And then her husband's ex died and my mom and her husband wanted to take in her other kids (not mom's stepkids) and mom told me she/they were adopting them all. At that point I just sorta gave up and asked my grandparents if I could live with them. There were some custody things still being worked out so I was only living with those other kids a couple of days. Mom was shocked when I told her I wanted to stay with her parents but she let me, thinking it was temporary. But she's realized after more than a month that I'm serious.

This has lead to us having more of a maternal bond rather than a sibling bond.

After I moved out my baby brother started dating a girl. During this time my parents let her move in. I had no knowledge of it. On this particular night I slept over at my parents house my baby brother was a sophomore. His partner said she was going to bed and I assumed her parents were picking her up. That wasn‚Äôt the case and she walked into my baby brothers room and closed the door. I was shocked given the fact my parents were strict with my older siblings and I. My brother continued to play house with his partner and my parents allowed it. I had concerns with how this would affect his development and his ability to be a kid. Of course they‚Äôll let me raise their kid but god forbid I have input or worries about his wellbeing.

Fast forward from 2020 and her moving in to now. My parents have since moved back to our home state. I‚Äôm alone in the state they moved us to besides my brother. He moved into her mom‚Äôs house with her (that is a whole other story). They‚Äôre having a baby. I cried and I was in shock. I just wanted him to have more of an opportunity to be an adult and live life. He is an adult now and this is the path he chose. I‚Äôm excited yet nervous. I think since he was the baby he doesn‚Äôt realize the reason none of his oldest siblings have kids is because we were busy raising him.

Forward to me asking my baby brother for an afternoon alone with him. I haven‚Äôt seen him in 6 months. During our last interaction we seen one another for about an hour because his partner was texting him constantly asking when he‚Äôd be back. It hurt me a bit but I understand happy wife happy life. 2 weeks ago I took an entire day off to hangout with him. Well the day before our planned day she wasn‚Äôt going to let him come without her. I messaged her very kindly letting her know I don‚Äôt get to see him often and she sees him everyday. I realize she‚Äôs early in her pregnancy and my brother doesn‚Äôt want to rock the boat. She sent me back a text telling me I disrespected her by not letting her come with him to lunch. I suggested to her that we have a girls day just her and I. I don‚Äôt want her to feel not included. My parents have a close relationship with her because she lived with them. I was grown and moved out but I have made an effort to create a relationship with her.

Overall I‚Äôm feeling emotional that I can‚Äôt just see my brother by himself? I haven‚Äôt seen him since he called to tell me he‚Äôs having a baby.

41,1fkhb7u,AITA for not paying for road I would use if built.,"Straight to the story:  
A developer in our area went bust, and plots behind and next to my land were for sale for a good price. Suddenly, I had new potential neighbours.

One day a guy appeared on my land introduced himself and told me that he had bought the land behind mine and asked if I would agree to allow them to build a road on the border of my land, as the person who owns the land next to me don't want it to go in the middle of his land, but he would agree to have it on the border of our two lands, as he could also use the same road as his driveway.

I agreed and told him that sure - the only condition is that I can also use the road if I need to access that side of my land if I need for whatever reason, so he has to do all the paperwork and when everything is ready we can make it official.

We exchanged contacts and everything seemed to be great.

A few days ago I got an email with an attachment with plans and everything and costs divided to 3 assuming that everyone including me will pay 1/3.  
The future neighbour next to me replied, that he would only cover part of the cost of what he would use, as he would only use half of it.  
I replied to his email with something like ""I am sorry if there was a misunderstanding, but I will not pay for the road, because I don't need that road, I will allow you to build it and my only condition is that I can use it if I need it.  
That means that the person next to me would have to cover 25% and the rest is the guy who is behind us.

The guy called me and was mad at me, that I was selfish and greedy, and that I expected to use something that others built and it would be so expensive for him! I am a jerk!

He did not exactly use the word asshole, but AITA?

EDIT INFO:  
I would allow it, because in my country the owner of landlocked land can go to court and this is usually the solution anyway - a road on the border of the other lands.  
It is not legal question tho, I asked if I am an asshole for not paying for it.

42,1fkgstp,AITA for not admitting that my dog is a pee monster?,"Okay here it goes. This past summer I was subletting a room in an apartment from a friend. All together, we had three cats and a puppy. The puppy was mine and like most puppies, he was not housebroken. When he would have accidents he always did it on the landing of our carpeted staircase. I did my best to clean it with the special pee sprays but that was not successful. 

Fast forward and I get a call from my friend that the apartment management is deducting a cleaning bill from her deposit because it smelled so bad. I instantly feel guilty and then blamed the cats. I was simply too embarrassed to admit that I am shit at potty training and my puppy liked pissing on carpet. I then offered to pay off the cleaning bill, which she accepted.

43,1fkgoh5,WIBTA if I asked the students I'm tutoring to pay me? ,"A bit of context here. I'm 28f and recently graduated to become an occupational therapist. My apprenticeship has been difficult for a multitude of reasons, but mostly financially. I had to pay for my school, rent, groceries and debts, so I ended up working two additional jobs while keeping up with my education. I never had more than one day a week off and routinely stayed up more than 24 hours at least once a week. I did end up graduating with honors and I have a good job ahead. But the extra work over the years has left me depleted and I had way too many sick days at school. So, to not risk burnout early on, I will work only four days a week, which is awesome but it also means about 600 euros less every month. 

A friend who is still at another OT school has recently asked me to tutor her on my day off to help prepare for her medical exams. I said sure, 90 minutes once a week should be possible. Now she's also invited three of her classmates and the tutoring is going to be a lot more complex than I imagined, which means additional preparation time. Feeling a bit overwhelmed, I said yes anyway. 

I'm torn. I'm looking forward to helping them out...but I have a four day week for a reason. I can't bail on them now, they are counting on me for their exam. But I would like to ask them to pay for the lessons. The reason I might be TA if I do that is that they also have to pay for their education. I would not have been able to afford tutoring before my exams. And also, I don't even know if I'll be a teacher that's worth spending money on. They likely went into this thinking they'd get these lessons for free. I really could use the additional money but it's not like I couldn't live without it. The cost for each of them would be about 10 euros a week.

Edit: after reading the kind reassurances here, I did ask them to pay me the aforementioned amount. I was really nervous about it but it turned out they had been planning to pay me all along.

i 23 F and my fiance 24 F go big days like anniversaries, holidays and birthdays we both have agreed to do so within reason. 

on our anniversary a few months ago we decided to go to an amusement park and the deal was that i pay for the tickets and hotel and she pay for everything else like food and gas. 

a month before, we talked about the finances of it all and i told her she needed at least 300 for the trip just to be safe and she said that‚Äôd be no problem. 

once we went on the trip i then realized she didn‚Äôt have that much saved so i ended up paying for all food except one meal and she payed for gas. 

i was a little upset so we had a conversation about how i was disappointed that she didn‚Äôt do what she said she would. she felt really bad and promised to make it up to me for my birthday which is in October. she said this in july. 

something about me is that i‚Äôm fully disabled and can‚Äôt work. i have to live with my parents right now because of my condition so what money i have is in stocks and i have to sell in order to get larger chunks of money. i only do this for special occasions because since i have no income, i can‚Äôt put anything towards buying. 

my fiance currently works full time at a job that pays pretty okay. she lives on her own in a two bedroom apartment with a roommate who she splits all bills with. 

i understand that she has a lot more expenses than i do so sometimes i understand when she can‚Äôt always come through with what she‚Äôs said for financial things. 

after the amusement park thing, she promised she‚Äôd go all out for my birthday which is going to a hotel with an indoor pool for one night near a big mall that has a lego store so i could pick a reasonably priced one out for us to build together. 

i‚Äôve been doing what she asked and trusting her to plan this. she‚Äôs even a few times since then asked if im excited for it

at first i was just sad but then i got angry. i remembered all the times she‚Äôd ordered food or like just the other day spend over 100 dollars at spirit halloween. 

she hasn‚Äôt had any unexpected bills or emergencies that would have kept her from saving either. 

i told her that i was disappointed and angry and brought up the past stuff. i‚Äôm not as much disappointed about my birthday but more that she broke another financial promise.

49,1fkfik7,WIBTA if I gave away my friend‚Äôs coats ?,"I (26F) helped a friend (28F) out over the summer. Basically, her landlord threw her out because of the Olympics (I live in Paris), and since she was moving to Milan with her fianc√© at the end of August, she didn't want to find an appartment for only a month (and AirBnBs were insanely expensive).

I live in a very small appartment (14m2, what we call une chambre de bonne) but I agreed to host her for that month. It was cramped but we made it work. She didn't pay for anything (rent, electricity, groceries...), but it felt weird to ask so I let it go.

She left for Milan three weeks ago, and I noticed that she had left some things behind - mostly small stuff, but it includes 2 big, heavy winter coats. I'm actually going to Milan for work this week-end, so I offered to bring back the small stuff, but told her the coats would not fit in my suitcase.

At first, she told me I could donate them, which worked great for me because my building is collecting clothes for charity next week. But two days later, she sent me another message and asked me to mail them back.

I told her it would cost about 60‚Ç¨ to ship two heavy coats to Italy, and that I didn't have the time, and she immediately changed her tune and asked me to just keep them in my closet until she found someone to pick them up. I said I really didn't want to keep them too long because again, I don't have a lot of space.

The thing is, she's planning her wedding (it's in October), so I'm pretty sure finding someone in Paris who could come to my place to pick up the coats is very low on her list of priorities. But they take up almost half of my closet right now, and I just want to get rid of them.

Since my partner has 4x more in-game money than me that‚Äôs just sitting there, I asked if he could help out by buying the weapon we‚Äôve been borrowing so we both could use it at the same time and we won‚Äôt have to keep splitting it between two accounts. That way, I could keep saving for the armor instead of spending my money on the weapon.

A few weeks ago, my friend asked me to keep the items my partner borrowed on my account because he was worried my partner might forget to give them back when he returns.

I attended public school but my sister who was a freshman got into the performing arts charter school as a trumpet player.
My school was really old & the marching band was stuck in the past. While most schools‚Äô band fronts changed to color guard over the last few decades, my school still had poms, twirlers, & silks. Even though it was outdated it was crazy popular; everyone wanted to be one. It took a week of practice & then you auditioned. I didn‚Äôt even make it my first year auditioning. I got on the silk squad junior year & was so excited.
My sister joined her school's marching band. Her school stole all the musically talented students in the school district. So her marching band was really good. Her band had a color guard that no one wanted to join; they had to beg people to sign up.
On the other hand, our band sounded pretty bad. They lacked talent & the instruments were super old.
Her marching band LOVED to rag on ours. I didn‚Äôt mind, it wasn‚Äôt like she was coming after the silks & it was true, our band didn‚Äôt sound great.
To be fair, when we played against their team we would make fun of their color guard.
My sister caught wind of this & said I wasn‚Äôt allowed to make fun of them because they were a part of her band. So it was making fun of her team.
I was like ‚Äúok but then you have to stop making fun of my band.‚Äù Her argument was that my band suuuucked but hers didn‚Äôt so I couldn‚Äôt make fun of her band.
I was like, you can decide if we are or aren‚Äôt allowed to make fun of each other's schools. She thought she was right & would get our mom involved if I ever said anything about her band.
My mom would defend her band & not say either of us were right. She would yell at me to drop it if I went on about how it wasn‚Äôt fair. Sister loyalty should go both ways & she was being hypocritical. But even now I still think I was right, even though I could never get anyone to say it because they didn't want to take sides.
Trash talking their color guard only when we competed against them is a little different than the way she would talk about my school‚Äôs band. Making fun of my school & band was like a regular talking point for her & her band friends.
She asked if she could wear my band uniform to school on Halloween. I know she wanted to go as a ‚Äúsilk from my talentless dumb school‚Äôs band‚Äù which is making fun of my specific team, not just her rival band. I think that was uncool, like we are sisters & she knows how hard I worked to get on the team. That could‚Äôve gotten me in trouble.
I have had a similar drama with her more recently that would be too long but this encompasses her really well. I‚Äôve mostly let it go but a part of me wants to hear other people‚Äôs verdict. I didn‚Äôt ever hear an opinion since the topic had been forbidden by my mother. So AITA?

So to be short me 34 m and my girlfriend 31f are together for 2 years now. In the beginning she had a friend she wanted to visit which she had a fb relation with.

After me and her best friend told her that was a bit weird she gave up on the idea. She was stil in contact with him and he was always a bit flirty, she wasnt as far as i know. After some time he send her a dickpic wich she told me about and she blocked him. Only when i told her i wasnt comfortable with the situation anymore, she was stil debating keeping contact because he helped her mentally through her divorce.

Now after months after nothing happening she out of the blue tells me she can get a ps5. From the same dude apparently they were still in a same gaming group app. He said he wanted to sell it and she wants to buy it. Wich is odd for me already because she never owned a ps5 or told me she wanted.

And im still suprised she was in contact after the last altercation. And i havent shared my doubts yet i only laughed a bit and asked if she was going to pick it up and the answer was yes.

57,1fkdcxz,AITA for being aggressive towards my friend over their drug problem? ,"I haven‚Äôt done this before but right now I really want random opinions of strangers online. Alex has been a friend of mine since we were kids.      

Alex also has a pretty bad addiction problem - to anything and our friendship has been everything but peaceful. Alex doesn‚Äôt know how to quit things, down to people. I‚Äôd have to basically force them out of toxic relationships and they were the kind of friend who would come crying to you for advice, you‚Äôd rack your brain and do your best to comfort them, and they wouldn‚Äôt take any of the advice and come back crying. I am not the kind of person to tell someone ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù, so naturally I was forced to comfort them. This has been a long issue and I admit that I should‚Äôve said something before so this wouldn‚Äôt feel like such a mess. 

Nevertheless, Alex has started to abuse over the counter drugs. I always put my foot down and told them that this wasn‚Äôt ok, and every time they‚Äôd relapse I‚Äôd get mad at them. I‚Äôve tried the nice route as mentioned before, so me becoming angry at them was a desperate try to make them see that this is effecting the people around them too. Today they told me they wants to micro-dose on the over the counter drug, sort of like a medication, and I got angry again. I admit I didn‚Äôt go lightly about some things, saying sentences like ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt control yourself anymore‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt seems like you aren‚Äôt trying anymore‚Äù. These really touched a nerve with them. 

According to Alex, they‚Äôve ‚Äúresearched this‚Äù and have only done the over the counter drug ‚Äúa few times‚Äù. I argued back that they still want to depend on this drug, and I haven‚Äôt received a response back. 

You have to understand I‚Äôm at my wits end with Alex. They would bring stress to me to the point of tears, and I really want to word vomit all my emotions and cut them off. Except, they‚Äôve been my friend for longer than I haven‚Äôt known them and they don‚Äôt really have anyone else.

59,1fkd8vr,AITA for voicing my concerns about my friend dating someone?,"I (32F) have a close group of friends, and we often support each other through tough times. Recently, one of my friends, Sarah (30F), went through a rough breakup. She was understandably upset, and I tried to be there for her as much as I could.

As part of her healing process, Sarah decided to start dating again and went on a few dates with someone she met online. While I was supportive, I expressed my concerns about her moving on too quickly. I gently suggested that she might want to take more time to heal before diving into new relationships. Sarah got defensive and said I was being judgmental.

A few weeks later, she asked if I would come with her to meet this new guy, saying she needed moral support. I agreed, but when we arrived, I realized that the guy was a former friend of mine who had hurt me in the past (another long story). I felt uncomfortable but didn‚Äôt want to ruin her night, so I stayed quiet and tried to be supportive.

In addition, I had made an effort to look nice, and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice that I was getting more attention from him.  When I eventually brought up my history with the guy, Sarah seemed upset‚Äînot just about the past, but also about how things were going that night.

Afterward, she accused me of trying to sabotage her happiness.

Now, I‚Äôm feeling conflicted. I genuinely wanted to support her, but I also think I had a right to express my discomfort. Some friends think I was wrong for not just being supportive, while others believe I was justified in speaking up.

60,1fkd66f,AITA for overdressing at a bachelorette party," My (25f) friend Kat (26f) had her bachelorette party recently, and we had a blast celebrating her for the long weekend. Everyone helped with the planning, so things went smoothly with everyone on the same page. The days were for chill activities  and the nights were themed nights out (think ‚Äúvintage chic‚Äù and ‚Äúback in black).

On Day 2, when we stopped to shop before lunch, Kat pulled me aside and asked to speak with me privately. We stepped out front of the store where she proceeded to ask if I would ‚Äúconsider picking up a different outfit to go out in that night‚Äù. I laughed and said ‚ÄúSure, you know I love to shop! I have an outfit picked out though, so my bank account is saved this time!‚Äù Kat was quiet for a moment, and then said ‚ÄúLook. I know you love fashion and stuff, but you‚Äôve been really over dressing this trip. I don‚Äôt know why you brought all of your nice stuff to wear on MY bachelorette trip?‚Äù A little stunned, I just took a moment to process before asking her to ‚Äúplease explain a bit more about how she was feeling‚Äù. Kat then essentially told me that while she appreciates the fact that I like to play with my outfits, she felt like I was trying to ‚Äúshow off‚Äù or ‚Äúoutshine her‚Äù by wearing designer clothes. This didn‚Äôt lead to any sort of a fight between us, but there was certainly a tense moment when I eventually said ‚ÄúI am so sorry that you feel this way and I will 100% wear less accessories tonight when we go out, but I‚Äôm not going to buy a whole new outfit when I already brought clothes to wear tonight‚Äù. Kat said OK. I said OK. That was that.

Also, I don‚Äôt really wear colors and I didn‚Äôt wear any white (bc not the bride). 

Here‚Äôs a summary of what I wore.
Day 1 : I arrived in sweatpants, a Tshirt, my dad‚Äôs cap, jewelry, plain sneakers (designer) and carry-on bag (designer). That night I went out in a sequin mini skirt, an XL thrifted button down, kitten heels (designer) and jewelry with no bag.

61,1fkd611,AITA for not protecting my daughter from her sister's bullying?,"I (49f) have two teenage daughters, a 16 years old and a 13 years old. In this post I will just call them by their ages for privacy reasons. 13 often insults her older sister by calling her names like ugly, stupid, and useless. She even makes rude faces and gestures to 16 and this happens every day. Sometimes 13 even follows 16 to continue her behavior, but this isn't very often.

I am tired of 16 calling for me when this happens as I think it is 16's responsibility to deal with this herself. I have told her to wither yell back at 13 or just ignore her. I encourage her to confront her younger sister, but she is scared of 13 and would just cry. I have also adviced her that maybe her buying 13 some presents would buy her some peace from 13, but of course I never forced her to and it was just an option. Occasionally I would chip in and defend 16 a bit but it often just escalates the situation. And of course I have sternly told 13 to stop before but this only makes matter worse.

I have actually tried scolding 13 before, but she never listens and would just end up insulting us both. And I am not trying to avoid being insulted, she does this to me sometimes too. There is nothing I can do about it. Consequence doesn't work with her also as grounding doesn't really take anything away from her and her phone is impossible to remove. 

The problem with 16 is that she is terrified of her sister and would not scold her younger sister when 13 repeatedly picks fights with her, despite me encouraging her to. 16 is normally pretty assertive so this is not the problem.

I (39f) have recently qualified as a teacher and am currently experiencing the absolute head f*** that is a new teaching career (secondary UK). I‚Äôm working all hours and then I come home, do some bits and bobs here and then often go to bed by 9.30. This has been understandably hard on my wife (38f) and our children (10m and 8f). 

Yesterday was particularly hard. There are some issues going on with our daughter and I was really feeling the strain of not being at home as much at the moment. I also had a really difficult class and Wednesdays are always a long, long day because our children go to their dad‚Äôs and I can get a little ahead for the week - however, I felt like I was chasing my tail all day yesterday. I‚Äôm also premenstrual, so the overall effect was that I cried several times over the course of the day. My wife knew all this.

She went to a gig last night and had left before I got home. I didn‚Äôt really hear from my wife all evening, which isn‚Äôt unusual and I wasn‚Äôt concerned as I knew she was enjoying herself. I text her at about 8.45 and said I was going to bed, but I didn‚Äôt get a reply. At about 9.30, I woke up to hear her shouting at our dog (not aggressively, just shouting at her to get into bed). She then slammed one of our downstairs doors that‚Äôs right under our room. I hear her come up and she was doing really loud, theatrical, drunken hiccups - like I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised if a cartoon bubble and the word *hic* was coming out of her mouth. Fine. It happens. Whatever. I could hear them through two doors but I assumed she‚Äôd try and get rid of them before she came to bed. Nope.

By this time, I was irritated. I was already annoyed she‚Äôd come in shouting - she would have been furious if I‚Äôd done that to her - and I just wanted to be asleep after a horrible day, but she came to bed still doing the loud hiccups. Eventually, I rolled over and said ‚Äòare you ok?‚Äô and she just slurred ‚Äòyeah, are you?‚Äô (I had to infer from context because she didn‚Äôt really have words at this point). So I told her that I wasn‚Äôt really. I said she‚Äôd come in loudly and woken me up and that if it was me, I would have tried to get rid of the hiccups before I came to bed with my sleeping partner.

Next thing I know, she‚Äôs up, having a go at me for being rude and saying I could have just asked nicely. Then said she‚Äôd just fuck off if that‚Äôs what I wanted and walked out of the bedroom, slamming the door really hard behind her. I couldn‚Äôt really get back to sleep after that. 

She slept on the sofa and I just woke her as I get up at 5am. I said ‚Äòdo you want to go up?‚Äô and she snapped ‚Äòyes‚Äô at me before going to bed. 

I had thought I was justified in being annoyed, but now I wonder if did overreact due to PMT and mental exhaustion. I definitely could have just said ‚Äòbabe, do you think you could try getting rid of the hiccups?‚Äô although I don‚Äôt think that would have got a better reaction tbh.

He then told me that he had confirmed it with her, and she said it was okay but sent no proof.

Brian is a very, very lonely guy. He has no friends other than me. He lives alone in a condo in California. I live in Texas with my boyfriend (31 M), let's call him Kenny (not his real name).

Brian has no luck with dating. He wants a clean-cut girl, no kids, no tattoos, nothing like that, willing to convert to his religion. He calls me every single time he has a failed date, when he's feeling depressed about being alone. He will call day and night, when I'm at work or late at night when Kenny is sleeping. Before anyone asks, no he's not trying to get with me. We're not the same religion, I'm not his type, and he knows I'm off the market.

Over the summer, Brian on a whim decided to come visit me. Because he has so much free time, he'll go on random trips across the country. He talked about coming to visit sometime, but I'd figured he would ask if that was okay with me and Kenny. I told him it'd be okay, just let us know when he planned to. You can imagined how shocked I was when Brian dropped in on me at work without any warning. Kenny, understandably was upset. It's common sense to ask permission to visit a friend, not just drop in whenever one likes. Brian stayed in town for a couple of days before heading back home.

Over the holidays, Brian was feeling lonely once again and was asking to come over for New Year's. I told him no. I had to work both New Year's Eve and New Year's day.

Some back story: Back in summer 2023 I (26f) connected with Amanda (26f) online through mutual friends. We both had found out we were pregnant and started posting announcement photos and gender reveals. Amanda reached out to me and we started bonding over our pregnancy‚Äôs. Amanda had a really rough pregnancy and had to get iron infusions and was constantly sick where as my pregnancy was a breeze. We would message back and forth and I quickly became a support system for her which I was more then happy to be. I had my baby girl November 2023 and Amanda had her son January 2024. And from the day her son was born we talked every single day until a week ago. We became extremely close very quickly with our bond over our children and would get our babies together. Something to note is that Amanda has basically no support system. She only really has a couple friends and her boyfriend‚Äôs dad to rely on but openly told me I was the sister she always needed. 

Lately ive noticed that Amanda‚Äôs son is extremely behind on milestones and does things like rocking his body in weird ways, growling instead of babbling, weird hand and eye movements, sensory issues, etc. I also have a friend who is a behavioural therapist for autistic kids and works with them every day and had brought it up to her and she said he needs to get tested when he turns one because she sees exactly what I see and told me I should Amanda about what I‚Äôve noticed. The thing is Amanda can be very defensive and I knew she wouldn‚Äôt like me bringing it up so in passing conversation with her boyfriend (I‚Äôm helping him to plan a proposal for her) I brought up over the phone to him what I noticed and he said him and Amanda had talked about it and they think so too.

Now here is what I don‚Äôt understand. I guess he told Amanda I had asked about it and she got so mad at my comment she ghosted me. After a few days I messaged her boyfriend to see if she was okay and he told me Amanda was absolutely pissed about my comment. Everyone I talk to is divided on this. Some people see I was coming from a place of care and concern and some people think I was out of line and it was none of my business to begin with. Personally I would want someone to bring it to my attention if they saw it in my baby so it was something I could look out for. I don‚Äôt see autism as the terrible thing some other people do. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the end of the world, I think it‚Äôs just the start of a different world and the quicker you know the faster you can educate yourself to help them succeed in life, a lot of adults with autism are the most brilliant people there are and I hate the stigma behind it.

We're gone in a month. His sister(24) isn't happy with us because of multiple reasons. When she first heard the news, she said, ""there are two bedrooms? So I could come with you?"" (as a joke?)

I was sitting with my group telling dad jokes to my campers and Laura came over and said ""I was commanded to come over here"" I said ""Do you not want to be over here?"" and she responded with ""Not really"".

She was going around memorizing the kids' names when she got to a girl named Finley, she couldn't remember her name so Laura turned to me and asked me what her name was. I said ""Finley"", she repeated and I said ""You got it!"" Now one of my campers decided to say ""It's FinLEE not Finley"". I quickly said to Laura, you said it right the first time."" She looked at me with a smirk and said ""How do you know? You can't hear"". I was shocked. I stared at her and tilted my head giving a sarcastic laugh and immediately put my head down to eat my food and she proceeded to toss a wrapper at me and laugh. I was enraged but again I was on a field trip surrounded by kids so I decided not to correct her. Later that day I was telling my best friend who is also my co-worker what happened and she said that Laura came up to her and said ""I said something effed up to Anna"". I admit that talking about it with everyone isn't the solution to the problem but I had to rant. I came home crying to my mom and my mom didn't know what to do since this was the first time I had to deal with face-to-face discriminatory comments. Laura ended up sending me a message apologizing but I was still upset and knew it was best not to respond that night but the next day. I wrote down what happened, gave it to my boss, and talked to my supervisor. My supervisor said that I should've said something right away because it is not appropriate to say that in a work setting or a general setting. She said that I can't let it simmer and should confront situations like this that are discriminatory towards me.

74,1fkav1s,AITA for refusing to speak to my sister after she ate my birthday cake before I saw it?,"So it was my (19f) birthday about a week ago and I was really looking forward to it. Mostly because my mental health has been extremely bad these past few months and I haven't had anything to make me even a little hopeful/happy for somewhat a long time now.

Well the night before my birthday rolls around and my mother and sister (15) are urgently telling me to pick a spot to eat for the big day (mostly my sister) but I am really indicisive so its taking a while. I woke up early and decided on a cute cafe I could bring my mother and sister too, and also a Photo Booth we would take pictures at afterwards.

My dad got me a cake that he put away until the time came at night to blow out the candles. I was getting ready and didn't hear my sister come from school so when I go to her eventually to tell her the plans for that day she immediately starts to snap at me. She basically said that I needed to pick a different place and that if I didn't she wouldn't go. I tried not to let it get to me but all my friends were in different states and her + our parents were the only people who were around.

I tried to not let her see me cry, so to cheer myself up I decided to look at my cake for the first time and to my surprise someone had taken a slice of it. The only person who could've done it was her so I asked and she said ""yeah""... I honestly was in a state a shock atp and couldn't wrap my head around it. I asked her why? and she said that she thought ""I wouldn't care about it that much""  and ""She was starving after a long day at school"". I yelled at her and she only gave me a half assed sorry after my dad forced her to.

I cried the rest of the day and didn't end up going to the places I wanted so I  put my candles in a cupcake and just lit them myself in my room. She continues to gaslight me and make it seem like I'm overreacting about the situation.

Is this just normal teenage bratty behavior? I won't speak to her until she gives a proper apology. We have had a really close relationship and don't understand why she'd do this.

75,1fkarnq,AITA for beating a dude in smash bros?,"

So over the course of a few days, I (24F) beat my coworker (21M) in smash bros. It all started last Saturday when we arrived at our lodging for a work trip we‚Äôre on. In the common area, I saw he was playing smash bros and I play myself, so I asked if we could 1V1. I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying I am by no means a pro player at smash bros. 5 wins later and I ask if he‚Äôd like to keep going and he obviously does because he wants to win. I think out of 15 matches he won 2. Not once did I say anything to demean him, I was playing for fun and was just trying to have a good time. No trash talk whatsoever between us. Despite me winning most of the time, some were close matches. We say ‚ÄúGgs‚Äùafter the whole thing! He then says tomorrow after work we should definitely rematch, so I say sure. 
The next day is maybe only 5 rounds and he wins the last one. He still wants a rematch, so we decide we‚Äôll play the upcoming weekend. The weekend rolls around and we‚Äôre back at it again. It‚Äôs been 4 wins for me and after the fifth round that I win this guy throws his controller across the room and storms out the door leading straight outside. Some coworkers witness this ask me what happened and I say that I won our match in smash bros. The guy I beat is literally sitting in the grass holding his head in his hands. One of the coworkers who witnessed this asks how many times I beat him and I shrug and say maybe 5 at this point. This dude straight up tells me ‚ÄúYou gotta know when to let someone win.‚Äù
This tripped me out since we‚Äôre all grown adults and the guy kept saying he‚Äôd like a rematch. If he was a kid, of course I‚Äôd let him win. I just want to know what everyone else thinks, I‚Äôve heard mixed opinions about this situation from all my coworkers and would love to know what Reddit thinks.

76,1fka96k,AITA for giving my husband the cold shoulder?,"Context: Tonight, as my husband was showering after work, I was sitting in the bedroom and turned on the PS5 to go to YouTube to try and find a specific video from several days ago that my husband had showed me. I went to history, and found several things that made me feel really uncomfortable. There were 2 separate instances where he had watched 4-5 back to back shorts of specific girls (1st was a girl who ""golfed"" and wore a paper thin top with nips showing and the videos were slow mo with a focus on her chest flopping everywhere. 2nd was a girl who did seemingly meaningless tasks walking around in a skimpy gym outfit). I confronted him about it and he tried to tell me the following 1. They were all in succession of each other on the regular ""shorts"" section 2. That it had nothing to do with his YT viewing preference. 

I don't know much about YT as I don't really use it outside of my job, but I know that he's feeding me bullshit. I know that looking at my shorts feed doesn't populate random shirtless dudes or guys golfing with thin shorts and no underwear. I know it seems trivial, but his defensive reaction and decision to think I'm stupid enough to believe the bullshit he tried to feed me really laid into my self confidence and hurt me. I have a pretty nice body, rather large behind and am curvy but thin in certain areas. I don't have a chest though and it's always made me self conscious. He's always claimed he didn't have a preference on whether I got the boob job I always fantasize about getting. 

Edited to add:

We have had this conversation before and had come to what I THOUGHT was a mutual agreement that watching thirst trap women on social media outlets was NOT something I was cool with.

My (37F) sister in law to be insists I come help her pick out dresses because of my body shape. I'm not a fan of her to begin with but this is for my brother (38M) wedding. After hours of trying one at multiple stores she decided on a dress she liked. I'm a tiny person but I have a dramatic hourglass body shape.

I'm trying to hold back I'm thinking of my brother and the stress of the wedding planning, so I give in and they order an extra small for me. 8 months pass my medication has caused my body to change, I had gained 60 pounds and I spent the month before the wedding practically starving myself hoping I would fit the dress. We all gather day of wedding to get dressed together I'm expecting it to be a bit tight so I brought a few shapewear hoping that would help the situation. As the other girls slipped into these comfy mid thigh dress I'm trying not to cry. I had on two different shapeware pieces struggling to hold me in. It took 4... Yes 4 women to pull the dress close enough that the bride herself managed finally to zip it up.

Keep in mind I‚Äôm not a child psychologist but I understand 5F worries about losing her mom to the baby and knowing I had something to do with it, if that‚Äôs the case.

86,1fk8anf,AITA for calling my friend‚Äôs future SIL a disrespectful bitch?,"Names are fake except for dog names.

I have this friend, Sadie, who is getting married in October. We were sitting around her fianc√©‚Äôs parents‚Äô place finishing up some wedding details. 

She has a friend, Ruby who has a service dog because she is blind and has diabetes. Her service dog is a female boxer named Ava. I never met either one of them. Ruby will be coming with her boyfriend to the wedding.

Sadie wanted to do something special for Ava so I suggested creating a doggie box filled with toys, treats, and other goodies. Sadie had got Ava a cute custom lavender dress for the wedding with the words ‚ÄúService Dog. DO NOT PET‚Äù in readable script. 

Sadie‚Äôs future SIL, Kathleen, happened to be walking past as we were excitably talking about what to put in the box. Kathleen owns a male chihuahua named Horatio. When she heard about Ava coming to the wedding, she flipped out, claiming that Horatio should be allowed to come as well. Sadie tried explaining that Ava was coming as a medical assistant not as a pet. Kathleen started going on about how Horatio was an emotional support dog. I rolled my eyes and she saw. She flipped out at me. I told her she was a disrespectful bitch to disabled people. She walked off in a huff. We got back to it but the mood was definitely soured.

Sadie called me later that night. Her future MIL was wanting to apologize or I would be banned from the wedding. Sadie and her fianc√© told me they were still on my side and I didn‚Äôt need to, but I should probably to keep the peace because they were so stressed out about the wedding. I think I could just have worded it nicer and been more patient or not got involved but I don‚Äôt know.

Edit: We still made the doggie box and it is all ready for Ava. I am keeping it at my apartment because they are afraid Kathleen might destroy it.

Edit 2: I also forgot to mention that I am high functioning autistic so it may have affected my response. When I get angry or upset, I have a tendency to let my emotions do the talking. I am working on it, but it is a slow process. And I think that‚Äôs also why I‚Äôm extra sensitive to any perceived slight against disabled people because technically I am in that class. Also, high stress situations tend to trigger me. And when Kathleen was flipping out and yelling and yelling and yelling, it triggered me I think. And I didn‚Äôt have my stress balls to manage. Sadie and her fianc√© know I have autism, but her fianc√©‚Äôs family doesn‚Äôt because I requested them to keep it a secret.

Edit 3: If I don‚Äôt like someone I‚Äôm pretty quiet about it. And I put up with it on normal day. I was honestly just expecting to have a relaxing day so I didn‚Äôt take my stress balls with me. I try not to lose my temper. And for the most part, I‚Äôm able to suppress it.  But I‚Äôm thinking in this situation I wasn‚Äôt able to when she started at me.

Edit 4: In regards to finances:

Sadie‚Äôs future mother-in-law isn‚Äôt even paying a single dime. The money for the wedding is coming from Sadie, her fianc√©, and her fianc√©‚Äôs paternal great aunt who generously gifted $10K as long as she‚Äôs not consulted on wedding matters. Her fianc√©‚Äôs great aunt just wants to show up, support the couple, and party ‚Äòtil dawn.

Sadie also found out that Ruby had spent $50K training Ava to do dual services. If Horatio had attacked Ava, that would‚Äôve been $50K down the drain and a lawsuit. Her boyfriend absolutely would‚Äôve pushed for her to sue Kathleen. Not to mention lost time for retraining Ava or training a new dog. Kathleen and her family does not have $50K to spare for new service dog training.


Update: 
Sadie and her fianc√©, Tyler called me last night. Tyler had big talk with his parents about the situation. At first the mom was going on about how I was rude and disrespectful. But then her fianc√© interrupted and basically gave them a reality check. 

Tyler told his parents:

‚ÄúAva was a service dog, not a pet and it had cost Ruby $50K to buy and train her for the dual services of diabetes alert dog and guide dog for the blind. Considering they did not contribute money to the wedding because they could not afford to, he highly doubts that they would‚Äôve been able to afford to pay for retraining Ava or to train a new service dog. Kathleen equating that to a dog that has not been referred to an emotional support animal before makes her seem rude and entitled.
If Kathleen‚Äôs chihuahua, Horatio had attacked Ava, it could have been disastrous. It could have caused mental and physical harm to both Ava and her handler, Ruby who is blind and has diabetes (Tyler made sure to emphasize Ruby‚Äôs disabilities). That could‚Äôve resulted in a lawsuit brought by Ruby, her boyfriend (who had helped pay for training), and her parents. It could have also damaged their reputations in their community. 
Additionally, this was not the first time, Kathleen displayed ‚Äúspoiled brat‚Äù behavior. Kathleen was 29 years old. She needed to grow up and be mature. Sadie‚Äôs friend was harsh but it needed to be said and will not be apologizing. Sadie‚Äôs friend had gotten stressed from her yelling at the two of us and that Sadie‚Äôs friend had lashed out as a result of that stress, after Sadie had initially tried to defuse the situation. They as Kathleen‚Äôs parents needed to bring her in line because do they really want a daughter who throws a tantrum every time someone says no, or have to tiptoe around her in case they set her off, or pay $50K and additional costs associated with a lawsuit for reparations because Kathleen‚Äôs pet attacked a service dog that someone needs to stay alive?‚Äù

This statement, especially about having to pay $50K+, definitely affected Tyler and Kathleen‚Äôs parents. They decided that I didn‚Äôt need to apologize because I had simply retaliated from being stressed out. They still don‚Äôt know about the autism and they won‚Äôt know. 
They also decided to have a conversation with Kathleen, as well as give her consequences, since technically speaking she rents a small house that her parents own. They also decided to take Horatio to live with the paternal aunt who so generously gave $10K since she was looking for a companion anyway and had expressed interest in a small dog. Horatio‚Äôs ownership was registered to Tyler and Kathleen‚Äôs father, so he was well within his rights to do that. She had gotten him when she was in college so it simply a matter of convenience and they never switched the owners.

He then replied ""But it's not that important tho"" to which I just broke down and just hung up the phone. The following morning I got a text saying ""Wow, way to try and guilt trip people.""

Am I in the wrong for making posting about it in the first place? It's since been taken down, but I feel like I might have hurt people for not remembering but at the same time I feel hurt for being made to feel unimportant.

88,1fkyvcw,AITA in 30yr family friend AI art commission gone wrong,"I‚Äôm an artist.Im dyslexic and I have a very difficult time communicating with other women through messages. This is not the first time a ‚Äúmiscommunication‚Äù like this has happened (other times were with female tattoo artists). Which makes me wonder AITA?
My ‚Äúgod mother‚Äôs‚Äù son was my babysitter as a child and was one of the first people to get me excited about art. He was an artist himself and went on to marry another artist (I was at the wedding). The family has been in my life for more than 30 years and they mean a lot to me. His wife does art commissions and I‚Äôve always wanted a piece from her. After 10yrs of thinking about it I finally had a theme and the courage to ask her. I messaged her on insta and asked if she was interested in making a specific piece for me. She said yes and that the prices start at $100 cad. I said perfect that my cap is around $250, and gave more details about what I would like such as colours and poses and that I would send picture references . She said that she was excited and would send over a sketch after I sent my pictures. I sent over my pictures and maybe I was being a little cringe but I also sent her some pictures of her mother-in-laws art that I had and some of my own art. She sent me back 6 AI generated images and asked if any spoke to me. I was surprised at the time, we never discussed using AI, but I thought maybe that was easier for her than sketching 6 ideas and me only picking one. I also thought she would use the AI images to create a sketch of her own. So I picked 3 that I liked (2 were variations of the same thing) and gave more input on what I would like. The images were also kinda on theme but there are specific elements to the character that I wanted to be recognizable. I told her what I did like about the three images and what I would change and asked for her to include one recognizable element. She said that she agreed with what I would change and asked what size I wanted. I responded by asking her if larger meant she could add more detail. She responded saying she was starting sculpting the piece. At first I said ‚Äúok :) great‚Äù but after I slept on it I started to worry. In the morning I messaged her and said the exact measurements of the size I wanted. I apologized and said I thought she was going to send a sketch and asked her if we were going to discuss the price. She responded back saying that she thought the AI images would be sufficient and that she likes to work with more trust and less over sight and that she was no longer interested in the commission‚Ä¶.
So honestly I think this is the best outcome at this point. What if she made something I didn‚Äôt want and was like ‚Äúo said starting at $100, this is $600‚Äù‚Ä¶ so I‚Äôm just going to leave it now.

This also resulted in both our mothers being close friends as well.

Exactly 11 days before his dad passed he mentioned that his dad has been in a coma for almost 3 months and that he didn‚Äôt mention anything cuz he didn‚Äôt know how to which I understand. His mother also never mentioned anything about it according to my mom. However, tragedy struck and he called me to let me know about the news and asked if I could make it there before the burial ceremony. I told him that I can‚Äôt make it on such a short notice and I can‚Äôt afford the tickets right now and he hung up immediately after. I know he‚Äôs grieving and I don‚Äôt blame him on any extent but I feel conflicted on this. Is it expected of me to be there? I‚Äôve tried to call him on multiple occasions to which were unsuccessful.

90,1fkyfqm,AITA or is my husband taking advantage or my naivety? ,"We have been married 2.5 years and dated for a year. 
My husband (32) has an alcoholic mom who divorced his dad and married another alcoholic. My husband and his sister were raised by two alcoholics and his real father who was not an alcoholic (passed away) 

I didn‚Äôt think much about my husband‚Äôs drinking (4/5 times a week) The problem began when I realized he was taking big gulps of scotch directly from the bottle (came back from the gym early a couple of times) he said it‚Äôs not usual and he‚Äôd never do it again and he‚Äôll drink openly when he wants to. Fast forward 2 weeks and I got home unexpectedly, and I saw him drink directly from the bottle again (take a few big gulps) and when he realized I saw that - he said it was anxiety and depression that made him do it and began crying. 

We decided to get rid of the alcohol at home after couples therapy to stop these fights and also because my husband has an overactive bladder. He has wet the bed 15 times last year. I made a urologist‚Äôs appointment ‚Äì we got medication that we had to stop because it was expensive and at the time our old insurance was not covering it. Anyway, after some research I said that he should stop drinking excessive liquids from 7 PM (we sleep around 11) and got a watch that vibrates to wake him up thrice before 7 AM during his deep sleep.  

I still have to wake him up even with the watch because sometimes he doesn‚Äôt get up and sleeps thru it. On days that he forgets the watch he wets the bed. 

Since booze isn‚Äôt allowed at home he has bought and hidden Kratom black liquid and CBD. I am all using this recreationally but not daily. With Kratom when I found it hidden, I asked him how long he‚Äôs been taking this and he said a full year (hidden consumption the whole time) We had CBD outside stored in front for everyone to use if he wanted to use it, but he bought 3 boxes of gummies and hid it. When I found it - he said it was for his mom because ‚Äòwhen she has a gummy, she doesn‚Äôt drink‚Äô and they get high together one weekend every month when he visits them. 

I told my husband that he is using various substances to treat his anxiety and depression rather than seeing a psychiatrist. 
His friends have made snide remarks about his drinking in the past as jokes. 

We were supposed to have kids next year but now he tells me that he‚Äôs not ready for the responsibility because ‚ÄòI can‚Äôt take care of myself how will I take care of a child‚Äù ‚Äì He doesn‚Äôt want to buy a house either because ‚Äòit‚Äôs more responsibility‚Äù - even with me being an equal financial contributor. My husband feels like all these are real responsibilities apart from being married and he‚Äôs worried he can‚Äôt get high. We have had 3 accidents last year with his reckless driving and 2 this year (only car body damage) 

AITA for asking my husband to see a psychiatrist or it‚Äôs over? 

Edit - THC and not CBD.
Overactive bladder instances occur even when not drinking all day or for 3/4 days together. 
Edit 2 - thank you all for responding, it has given me various things to think about and has reinforced the fact that maybe I am not crazy for calling this substance abuse. As much as I love him for being a kind and fun person, funny, taking care of me - addiction is a beast on its own. One only learns these things after a long time of being with someone and I guess I just ignored or didn‚Äôt know better about any of these signs. 

He often tells me that ‚Äútaking modern medication for anxiety/ depression is the same as taking substances to quell his anxiety‚Äù  because they both involve ‚Äútaking something‚Äù - I just don‚Äôt know how he can‚Äôt see what he‚Äôs doing or perhaps he is and will say anything to justify his fix.

Then at school, the social pressure from teachers, staff, classmates, everyone... Next week a hairdresser is coming to the school, I'm ugly and insecure, and the only thing I get compliments for is my hair, I'm not going to cut it despite the noble cause, I can help them in other ways. They're begging me and saying that l'm obligated to donate since it's not that much, but I don't want to. That I should donate in the name of everyone since it is so long.

. I‚Äôve a teacher that keeps repeating the same thing again and again cuz the project was her idea, I‚Äôm taking longer and different routes to not see her. AITA if I skip school that day?

""The Poor kids don't have the chance to choose, you have"". I've met countless people who had/have cancer and only one of them cared about their hair.

95,1fkxsjh,WIBTA for celebrating my(27F) birthday without my boyfriend(27M),"My boyfriend and I planned to go to NYC, do a cottage or Montreal for my birthday coming up next month and it also happens to fall on a long weekend. After looking at costs and our options, I told him I'd prefer to do NYC as we both talked about wanting to do it and it feels perfect. A week after that convo, my boyfriend who's part of a small local band tells me his band got asked to play at a festival in a small town 2hrs out from us that same long weekend. He asked how I'd feel about us doing a cottage instead of NYC and I am feeling like I'm stuck now between a rock and a hard place because my preference is do NYC but if we do that, his band won't do the festival. So WIBTA if I choose to go NYC with him forcing his band to opt out of a festival they all seem excited about? He says he would be happy to do NYC with me and cancel the gig but he also keeps asking me about alternative options that include him being able to do the gig. All of this has left me wanting to just go to my hometown during my birthday weekend instead and celebrating with my family and friends while he does his gig with his band. 

Context: 
- I have always wanted to celebrate my birthday with my partner and make it fun and cute ever since high school and this is my first time having a relationship in this capacity where I'm able to. He knows this.
- my birthday last year (1st birthday celebration as a couple) was a disappointment and left me in tears. He took me to a show because he planned it last minute knowing full well that I'm not a huge fan of going to the movies let alone a comedy skit style show. We then went to a restaurant I've always been wanting to go to and he hadn't made reservations so we got turned away. I appreciated the thought but it just felt like he didn't put much of an effort whereas I planned a whole trip to the mountains in Colorado for his. I would've appreciated something small and thoughtful over what clearly came across as last minute planning.
- there's a high chance he might not make money from this festival. Max amount if they're lucky would be 500 which would then be split amongst 4 people total.

I graduated highschool last year and took a gap year because I was unsure what to do (still am lol) 
Now I decided to start studying and stay at home to save money so I can hopefully move away next year. 

The past year I did some volunteering, internships, traveling, working, whatever you do during a gap year. I was only at home about 6 months of it and during that time I helped a lot with the household.
Of course, I always helped with basic chores, but now that I had more time I started cooking for my family more often and also tidying/cleaning around the house. 

I was never asked to do this, I feel like it's just what is fair, because not everybody gets to do what I did this past year.

It's something I've been struggling with as I realized that my people pleasing definitely comes from that.

My brothers also rarely do any chores, and if they do them, it's only because someone asks/forces them to.

I felt immediately bad, because also I know my mum always did everything when I we were younger and now she's the only one who actually does chores apart from me, so I feel like my anger was misdirected.

We both expect get married in the future and have kids in the somewhat distant future. I have always wanted to have kids, having always loved interacting with them and feeling a strong paternal nature. My girlfriend less so, but she still generally expects to have a child together in the future (a non-negotiable expectation I have expressed from the get-go). When discussing our future children, and specifically the aspect of their names, she has always deferred to me for choosing them, not expressing strong opinions about them. As such, for a few years now I have had a static list of names chosen that I would love for our children, and she has always agreed. 

However, 9 months ago my girlfriend grew a strong conviction for a name of a daughter. She became enamoured with this name when she recently learned it was her great grandmother's name. Frankly, for several small reasons, I do not like this name. I told this to her when she first mentioned it and she was very offended, although I was just being transparent with her. When she told me it was to honor her great grandmother I felt bad about it and said it was a fine name. That said, I was a bit upset that on a whim she was overruling the list of names we had long since agreed upon for a great grandmother she never met nor had any idea existed until this point in her life.

For the a girl, I put down the name my girlfriend wanted for a daughter. During the party its revealed that they are going to be having a girl. Now less than a week ago they share the two names they narrowed down their choices two with the family. Lo and behold, one of the two names they chose is the one I wrote for them. My girlfriend was made very upset by this. She immediately pegged that it was me who wrote down the name for them at the party and blamed me for giving away her baby name. While she was right, and I apologized for it, I argued that it was unfair for her to suddenly disregard the names that I had my heart set out on. However she did not care, and continued to ream me out for giving away her name.

\~2 months later my girlfriends sister (25 F) became pregnant with her husband. 2 weeks ago they had a gender reveal party. At the party the had all sorts of fun gender related activities, namely one for people to write down names for a boy and a girl and but it in a box for them to read later in private. For the a girl, I put down the name my girlfriend wanted for a daughter. During the party its revealed that they are going to be having a girl. Now less than a week ago they share the two names they narrowed down their choices two with the family. Lo and behold, one of the two names they chose is the one I wrote for them. My girlfriend was made very upset by this. She immediately pegged that it was me who wrote down the name for them at the party and blamed me for giving away her baby name. While she was right, and I apologized for it, I argued that it was unfair for her to suddenly disregard the names that I had my heart set out on. However she did not care, and continued to ream me out for giving away her name. The past few days had been fairly tense, she is still very angry I gave away her baby name, and I have been uninterested in revolving tensions after she completely ignored my concerns in the situation.

103,1fkvx0j,WIBTA if I reached out to my dad after cutting contact w/o telling my mom,"My (24F) mom and dad (54) have not gotten along for as long as I remember. My 2 siblings and I lived with my mom while my dad worked elsewhere, returning a few times a month. When he was in the area, he had a place elsewhere. My mom said he did not give her money for rent or to provide for three kids, things my memories corroborated. My dad was the fun parent. We would give him a call when we wanted him to take us out for dinner, twice a month or so, or if we wanted him to buy something. As a child, I felt bad asking him for things. These phone calls did not always result in him showing up for us. He talked about us going to live with him in a bigger house, and I would get to have a dog but also never did anything. My mom, though not the most loving parent, made sure my siblings and I were always clothed and fed. As she says to me now, my siblings and I never didn't have something other kids had.

This arrangement went on for many years until when I was 16. My mom was working on buying a house and was asking relatives for loans, something normal in my culture. I got home to my mom extremely upset because my dad's mom had been going around and telling his side of the family to not help her and bad-mouthing her. She gave us an ultimatum then: either we go with our dad or we cut contact with him. It really wasn't like we had an option then, but we cut contact. My mom bought the house and we moved away. After that, we found out that he falsified my mom's signature on divorce papers on which, he stated that they have no children. He ""married"" another woman and bought a house. My parents started the court process for divorce papers and back-pay for child support before the start of COVID-19 but is still delayed to this day. My dad apparently ""sold"" the house to his new partner to avoid having to give my mom anything. He and his family did try to reach out to us via calls and texts in the beginning but we never responded. He sent me birthday messages, messaged me to be careful driving when he heard I got my license, and gave my sister and me some money a few months ago when he learned we were going on vacation. We did not tell our mom about the money and I'm still not sure if that was a betrayal.

I was close with my dad and was raised by his parents early in life. Though I hate him for everything he has or hasn't done, as a father, it still hurts me to not be able to speak with him or my grandparents. Now that I am 24 and no longer live with my mom, I often wonder what will happen if I reach out to him again. I do not feel like I can talk to my mom about this because I know she will be angry, sad, and probably feel betrayed. If I do reach out, what can I even say after 8 years of giving them the cold shoulder? There is so much more to the story but this is the gist of it.
