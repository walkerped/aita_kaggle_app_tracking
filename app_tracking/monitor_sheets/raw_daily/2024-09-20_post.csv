0,1flmxph,AITA? I (18F) feel uncomfortable with my brother (18M) suddenly taking an interest in religion and I don’t know why. ,"So for background information, I (18F) grew up with my twin brother (18M) in a family that wasn’t really religious. My father’s side is religious, my parents got us baptized to please them. My mother’s side isn’t. Growing up, my dad’s side of the family would gift us mini bibles or prayer books, little stuff like that. I wouldn’t say I ever really got into it. I didn’t think my brother did either. He’s always been a bit of a rebel, he always got in trouble at school when we were younger and still causes trouble to this day, he just doesn’t  get caught. All this to say, he just never seemed the religious type. I’m not saying he’s an atheist, he just never seemed to take interest or care in this topic. Now onto the situation at hand. He’s become friends a few years ago with this really sweet guy that is christian, he’s also made friends with muslims. I’ve noticed he’s been taking a bit more of an interest in religion/christianity but I never thought he actually took it seriously, because, as I’ve said before, he’s a troublemaker. He’s recently purchased a Bible and said he wanted to read it. I don’t know why but it makes me uncomfortable. I’m agnostic, meaning I don’t have any belief or disbelief in religion, I’m kind of the middle ground of religious people and atheists. I’m also queer, which could maybe explain?? Since christians are the ones that harass the community the most. However I don’t think it has anything to do against Christianity explicitly, if reverted to Islam I feel like I would be as uncomfortable. Weirdly it’s just those two religions. Maybe it’s because they’re the most known religions that are against LGBT+ people. I normally don’t mind religious people, I don’t mind my godmother or my deceased grandmother (on my father’s side) but for some reason the idea of my mother, my father and even my brother being religious freaks me out. I really don’t know why so I’m hoping someone has an explanation or just to know I’m not the only one that feels like that. Maybe it’s the fact that they fully believe in going to Hell. Not because I’m gay, but because I’m not a follower. Because no matter how good of a life I lead, it doesn’t matter if I don’t believe in the right god out of the 4000+ religions, because I’m not a follower of any god. This summer, I went to a pride parade and there were christian protesters there and I talked to one of them, they were saying how they were trying to save me, save the children. I was in a state of shock of terror or fear, I don’t know, for the rest of the day. I want there to be a God but not if he’s this cruel. I think maybe I’m just scared the little support I have from my brother might vanish completely. I’m scared because I don’t want to lose my brother. I know he’s not dying but I feel like there will be this wall that separates us. We’re already distant, I don’t want it to get worse. AITA? I have no hatred or dislike towards religion, I find it beautiful, but I don’t want my brother for my family to become religious. 

Edit: I’ve looked through all your comments and want to thank you all for your feedback. I’ll follow some of you guys’ advice and try to talk to my brother about it and see how he stands when it comes to me being gay. I’m sorry if I came off as against religion, I was just scared it might cause more distance between my brother and I. I’ll try and update as soon as I can. Thank you again!",Asshole,2024-09-20,"AITA?

1,1flmmc1,AITA for not forgiving my best friend for missing my birthday ,"I 22f recently had my 22 birthday earlier this month. I had been planning my birthday with my best friend 23f since August. This birthday was important to me since I spent my 21st birthday sick in bed for two weeks. I had everything mostly planned out, hair & nails appointments made, reservations at the restaurant. Then about a week and half before my birthday she tells me her boyfriends best friend is getting engaged during the same weekend and she won’t be able to come to my party as she’ll be leaving with him out of town for the engagement party. This upset me a lot because I wasn’t planning a big party. I only have about three friends and a boyfriend so her not coming was a big deal for me. I had also already expressed my insecurities to her about my lack of friends and having such a small party.

To me her missing a birthday party that was important to me for an engagement party for a person that isn’t even her friend upset me. She has been dating his boyfriend for less than a year and this isn’t the first time that her boyfriend has come before our friendship. This is her first relationship and I understand that boundaries and dynamics will change when you start having a romantic relationship with someone. For some reason, I am not able to see her justification of it being her boyfriend’s best friends engagement party that that was more important.

She briefly apologizes, then suggest I move my birthday to a different day so that she can be there to celebrate. The problem with this is I am not able to move the appointment’s already booked for my pre birthday prep also the reservation I made for the restaurant wouldn’t be able to be moved. 

After a lot of back-and-forth, I explain that I am not changing my birthday party date for her. It felt more like she was trying to make herself feel better by offering to help me move all of my birthday prep appointments and finding a new restaurant for dinner. To me this was a bit insulting because I spent an entire month planning out every detail of my party.

We ended it at not seeing eye to eye and she left that weekend and I had my party. I updated her sporadically throughout the weekend about how it went and we haven’t really spoken to each other since. We went from hanging out 3 to 4 times a week to barely speaking or seeing each other. This is my fault because I am not reaching out and asked her for space to cool off when this first happened. 

I do know that I am being a bit of an asshole, but is it really that wrong if I don’t want to continue with our friendship like how it was before. Maybe we are just different people, but I wouldn’t pick a boyfriend over my best friend’s birthday. I’ve been best friends with her since seventh grade, and I’ve been able to not mind too much when we have to change our plans because of her significant other, but to me this was the breaking point.",Asshole,2024-09-20,"AITA for not forgiving my best friend for missing my birthday  I 22f recently had my 22 birthday earlier this month.

2,1flml9m,AITA for judging my friend after her mean comment? ,"Hi! English isn't my native language so I am sorry in advance for any possible mistakes I make. I appreciate your understanding.

So, the story goes like this: a very close friend of mine and I were talking about looks & appearance. 

She is what society would call ""classical beauty"" when it comes to her looks. Pretty symmetrical face features, what societal norms would refer to as ""a nice body"" etc. 

My facial features are not the same, as in I have a more unusual beauty, not so symmetrical, a nose that is a tiny bit too big for my face. 
The thing is when I was younger I used to really suffer because of this, but lately I can make the difference between what society has taught us to see beauty in and what beauty really is and how diverse it can be. I actually confessed this to her many times. 
While we were having this discussion we got to this point in which I reiterated this about being self-conscious about my looks and being able to see myself from the outside. 
I also said something about putting a little bit of weight lately (that's not important because I luckily don't have a problem with losing weight easily). But that is the point at which she said ""Your body is super beautiful! It's just your face that is different"". 

It shook me to hear her say something like that, it felt really cruel and useless. I continued the conversation but something changed for me since that moment. 

She is really dear to me, but tbh since she said that I started having really bad thoughts about her, like judging her a lot in my mind, thinking that she is super shallow etc. 

I thought about confronting her many times but didn't know how. It's been months since this and I can't get it out of my head. 
I would never say something like this to anyone, especially my friend who I know might have a sensitivity on this subject. 

What do you think? AITAH for judging her like this? Is it too much? Was she just honest and I am exaggerating and maybe I should appreciate her honesty?

Hi I'm a teenager who goes to a all girl secondary school and in that school are these 2 girls who are constantly giving me a rough time. They make fun of me for everything like having ADHD,being gay, being a nerd, having a old phone, taking the bus to school and being ""fat"" ( I'm actually much skinnier then them but whatever). They are incredibly rude to teachers and their grades are useless and they take part in no sports teams and yet they still think their better then everyone else. Now yesterday me and my mate where hanging out near her locker during break when they come up ( their lockers right beside hers) and start being horrible as usual. Honestly I usually don't give a crap. My friend was getting some books and they start to grab the door of her locker and slam it down on her. They do it all the time but my friend was having a bad day and got super pissed and told them to leave her alone and called them losers. The main bully answered back with hey in least I have friends. My mate answered back in least people actually like me. And then the main bully said something that really pissed me off. She said ""In least I have a country"" and started to mimic her accent now for context my mates is Ukrainian and moved to Ireland as a refugee 2 years ago. That made me super mad and I started screaming at them to shut the fuck up and that you can't just say that to people. I know it might have been a overreaction but I have been dealing with them for a while and the comment really hurt my friend. Now the whole school think I have anger issues.

8,1fllmh8,AITA for mocking my girlfriend's belief that the smell I experienced outside was my dead grandmother's spirit?,"Update: I realise it was a harmful thought and I apologised, I've done this before and I'll try not to do it again. But some of you need to chill, the interaction really wasn't as ""intense"" as it might have sounded.

Context: my girlfriend (30f) and I (30m) have been together for 8 years.

I was just outside the balcony sitting smoking a cigar and drinking a whisky, and for pretty much the whole duration of me outside I kept experiencing a smell of lavender that would come and go. I couldn't place where it was coming from, since out clothes don't smell like that, and where we live there aren't those kinds of smells so it was quite unusual. I thought it might come from a neighbour, but having a quick look around I couldn't really place the origin.

I didn't think much of it until I came back inside and told my girlfriend what happened. At that point she instantly said that it ""was"" either my grandmother (deceased) being with me, or my mother (alive, abroad) thinking about me, given they both like lavender and it is their favourite scent.

I am a pretty logical guy and so I immediately dismissed and even laughed at that comment, since I believe it's impossible that such thing would be the case and in my mind I simply hadn't investigated enough the source of the smell (mostly because I couldn't be bothered and was enjoying my break). I kept going on about how my girlfriend was being silly and dumb by thinking this (she was being totally serious), and she kept saying that I had no proof that it wasn't true, whilst at the same time she was suggesting that in fact it could also be just a random smell.

My issue with that is that it's unequivocal that it wasn't any kind of paranormal activity, and I started to get aggravated when she was even remotely suggesting otherwise. At that point I likened her to a flat earther because the claims she was making were totally unreasonable in my eyes, and just because you can't necessarily prove something at a particular moment, it doesn't mean that we can entertain the possibility that it might be true, when we know for a fact certain events can be explained by science.

Am I the asshole for mocking her and telling her it's stupid to believe this stuff, when she did no do the same to my beliefs (i.e. she didn't immediately dismiss my theory)?",Asshole,2024-09-20,"AITA for mocking my girlfriend's belief that the smell I experienced outside was my dead grandmother's spirit?

I didn't think much of it until I came back inside and told my girlfriend what happened. At that point she instantly said that it ""was"" either my grandmother (deceased) being with me, or my mother (alive, abroad) thinking about me, given they both like lavender and it is their favourite scent.

I am a pretty logical guy and so I immediately dismissed and even laughed at that comment, since I believe it's impossible that such thing would be the case and in my mind I simply hadn't investigated enough the source of the smell (mostly because I couldn't be bothered and was enjoying my break). I kept going on about how my girlfriend was being silly and dumb by thinking this (she was being totally serious), and she kept saying that I had no proof that it wasn't true, whilst at the same time she was suggesting that in fact it could also be just a random smell.

My issue with that is that it's unequivocal that it wasn't any kind of paranormal activity, and I started to get aggravated when she was even remotely suggesting otherwise. At that point I likened her to a flat earther because the claims she was making were totally unreasonable in my eyes, and just because you can't necessarily prove something at a particular moment, it doesn't mean that we can entertain the possibility that it might be true, when we know for a fact certain events can be explained by science.

Am I the asshole for mocking her and telling her it's stupid to believe this stuff, when she did no do the same to my beliefs (i.e. she didn't immediately dismiss my theory)?",1.0,1.0682961,1,1

recently we had a argument about his lack of communication and he was on some “you’ve never cared about me””you’ve never been there for me” which is a FAT lie, because he has these nonchalant tendencies where when i check up on him he shaves me away from actually connecting with him on an emotional level. i’ve always been there for him because i know that his not used to opening up and i’ve always let him know that whenever he needs me for literally anything im here. but anyway in our recent argument he said “fu*k you, you’ve never been there for me” WHEN THATS A DAMN LIE.

13,1flktfd,AITA for insinuating that my partner is lazy?,"My partner (M26) and I (M25) live in a two bedroom apartment. Last week I had a (scheduled months in advance) surgery, that greatly reduced my ability to help around the house. I cannot lift/pull/push anything over 10lbs, which means he has been walking my 60lbs dog every day. I join when I’m awake, just can’t hold the leash in case he decides to lunge for a squirrel. In the weeks leading up to my surgery, I explained several times what I won’t be able to do, and what he will need to do to help, which included several walks a day with me and my dog. 

The problem is, my partner has not owned a dog himself. He had a family dog that he clearly did not have much to do with as far as walking, despite how much he loved him and misses him. For example, my partner walked my dog at 8:30 the first morning after my surgery, and when I told him he’d need to walk him again before he left for work at 1pm, he was confused because he knows I have a friend come and walk my dog with me at 6pm, despite it being something I explicitly explained multiple times in the weeks before my surgery. The walk he takes my dog on is not even 10 minutes, which is fine, my dog is ~11 years old, does his business, and is happy to come back inside to cuddle. When my friend comes to walk him, we do a mile walk, so he still gets a fair amount of exercise. My dog has been fine with the shorter and fewer walks, and it’s temporary, so it’s fine. 

Today, my partner stumbled upon a husky puppy that needs a home, and since his family dog was a husky, he has a soft spot for them, and asked if we could get him. I told him no. For one, huskies are not apartment friendly dogs, they are loud high energy dogs, and it doesn’t make sense to get a puppy when I’m the one home all day and can’t take care of it, as my partner is away from home for ~12 hours M-F. He said he’ll do what he can to help take care of the puppy, so I called him out on not knowing that dogs needed several walks a day, and that he always complains on walks. I also brought up that he never joined me on the longer walks before my surgery because he didn’t feel like it. Which is fine, but that if he couldn’t join me on the longer walks then, what’s going to change to make him want to go on a longer walk with a higher energy puppy that’s going to need more attention than my senior dog? If he can barely bring himself to do a 7 minute walk after work with my dog, how is he going to do a longer walk that the puppy will need? How will he walk both dogs at the same time? 

He then asked me if I was calling him lazy, and I hesitated with my answer, which he did not like. I don’t think he’s lazy, I understand being tired from a long shift, I understand not wanting to get up and go on a walk. I’ve had my dog for 6 years and I’ve definitely had to drag myself to the door to walk him.

It's becoming very apparent that their cripplingly low self esteem is starting to really damage our relationship. What I mean by that is, A cannot have a conversation that doesn't circle back to them getting validation. For the first time in years, I went out on a date the other day, and what was supposed to be a quick conversation with my best friend about a successful date actually became a two hour discussion about whether or not I feel like A is unlovable. They do this with any singular topic I bring up around them.

If I make a blanket statement around them, they'll ask 'that could be. do you secretly hate me?' If I clean up our shared apartment around them, they ask 'Do you think I'm not good at cleaning?' If I pet my cat but don't pet theirs, they ask 'Do you hate my cat? Do you think I'm a bad owner?' 

I feel like I've become A's emotional support friend in a sense. At first, I was very happy that A felt comfortable with me enough to ask to be taken care of, but now it feels like A needs me for everything.

Before they form any opinion they have to talk to me about it. They are constantly making plans that involve me that they don't even ask if I want to do. My other friends are getting irritated that A will usually crash plans or say they 'need me.' If I'm on the phone with my mom, A also joins in. I feel like they need me more than anyone else in my life, and I have no idea how to make them understand this isn't normal and is actually pushing me away without making them shut down.

Every time I try to criticize them at all, like, 'can you get your cat, she's bullying my cat,' or 'can you not touch my medical supplies, you threw away a vial of my insulin that was totally full,' or 'I really don't like having to soothe you when we lose a match on our game, because it gives me no space to feel my own feelings, i have to immediately jump into soothing you.' A always comes back with 'You don't have to live with me. We don't have to be friends if we aren't compatible.'

17,1flkges,AITA for mansplaining my friends disorder to him?,"For background, one of my (16M) best friends is quite hot headed and gets mad quite easily, and one of the people he gets mad at more often is me. When he gets mad it isn't ever really serious and it's presented as being more playful (this is something he told me himself) and that it's supposed to be a show of affection, but he doesn't have this kind of dynamic with any of our other friends, and I don't like feeling like someone is mad at me.

This isn't really related to what happened today, but it's some important background. Today our other best friend asked on our three person group chat if OCD is an anxiety disorder. I happen to take an interest in psychiatry and I actually want to be a psychiatrist when I grow up, so I said that I didn't think it did, emphasis on think, but I didn't check beforehand. I believe reason I gave for not thinking it was one was ""anxiety isn't guaranteed, it's just a little treat"" (I'd like to clarify that I know that anxiety is very common with OCD and that it was classified as an anxiety disorder until very recently) and even though this was a joke I can see I can see how that might upset someone.  
The friend this post is about actually has OCD and he got mad at me in the same way he usually does and said that it actually it is an anxiety disorder and that I was wrong. I felt really bad and apologised immediately because I didn't expect that reaction. He told me to keep my whore mouth closed (which is funny) but I still wanted to check it myself, not because I don't trust him, but because as I mentioned previously, I really like learning about this stuff.

But after looking it up I realised I was right and that it wasn't classified as an anxiety disorder in the DSM 5 anymore. I told my friend this, (I was very smug about it because I thought that was the tone of our conversation)  and he just got angrier. He told me ""not to mansplain his disorder to him"" and I apologised again immediately after. He said it was okay but he sounded very annoyed and I don't want to annoy him or make him angry. This is kind of inconsequential and a tiny issue but this is one of many instances and I kind of want an apology. Should I confront him about this  and tell him that he upset me and I want an apology or am I the asshole?  
  
Edit: I'd like to clarify some things. Firstly, he has said himself that his anger is supposed to be playful, and I apologised to him. I know that if he was actually bothered by this he would have confronted me so this is not a matter of if he is upset or not I just want to know if the issue of him blowing up at me when he is not angry at me is something I should address (I have addressed this with him in the past and told him that I don't want to annoy him or make him mad at me and he told me that I don't have to be worried about it because he's never genuinely mad.) But considering this is a more sensitive topic and this time his initial outburst was genuinely unexpected, (he acted smug after correcting me initially, so I thought that was just the tone of the conversation) I wanted to know if I should apologise to him for my inconsideration. The ""should I ask for an apology"" line was typed while I was quite upset, not because he confronted me but because I was shocked at his sudden anger and I feel like he does this a lot and brushes it off or straight up does not mention it after I apologise, he only goes ""no its okay"" likes it's nothing and moves on.  
Secondly, my friend is non binary but uses he/him and masc terms, and the mansplaining thing was definitely meant to be a joke, since I am the only guy in the group chat.  
",Asshole,2024-09-20,"AITA for mansplaining my friends disorder to him? For background, one of my (16M) best friends is quite hot headed and gets mad quite easily, and one of the people he gets mad at more often is me. When he gets mad it isn't ever really serious and it's presented as being more playful (this is something he told me himself) and that it's supposed to be a show of affection, but he doesn't have this kind of dynamic with any of our other friends, and I don't like feeling like someone is mad at me.

This isn't really related to what happened today, but it's some important background. Today our other best friend asked on our three person group chat if OCD is an anxiety disorder. I happen to take an interest in psychiatry and I actually want to be a psychiatrist when I grow up, so I said that I didn't think it did, emphasis on think, but I didn't check beforehand. I believe reason I gave for not thinking it was one was ""anxiety isn't guaranteed, it's just a little treat"" (I'd like to clarify that I know that anxiety is very common with OCD and that it was classified as an anxiety disorder until very recently) and even though this was a joke I can see I can see how that might upset someone.

20,1fljp0c,WIBTA for throwing a disabled kid out of the house?,"I offered a friend a place to stay two and a half years ago when she was homeless. She was supposed to stay for just a couple weeks, as she had a section 8 voucher. Instead, she moved her then-18 year old son in, then disappeared after a couple months. Her son J was working with a case worker and said he was looking for a living situation. Jack is trans, autistic, and has OCD and a sleeping disorder. He quit school in the 7th grade., so doesn't have much of an education for getting a job. Time went on, and, for various reasons, he couldn't get in any housing programs through his social worker.

A year ago, I told him that he would have to find a place in a year. That time has come up. He still hasn't found a place.

Jack was just awarded disability, but hasn't received it yet.  I suspect that now that he has disability income, it will be easier for him to find something in the next couple of months. He has an aunt he could live with, but he doesn't want to, because she lives in a different city (same state), and he doesn't want to deal with the transition. He also doesn't want to live with his sister, because he doesn't get along with his sister's roommate. He says he'd prefer to go to a shelter, rather than do either of those things. I don't think Jack understands what being in a men's shelter in one of the U.S' most dangerous cities means.

Part of me feels like I should offer to let him stay for one or two more months to let him find something. now that he has a little income. But I've developed so much resentment towards him, because he's never once offered to help out or do anything to pay rent or his part of the utilities. More angering for me is that I've struggled to even get him to do his part of the kitchen chores, like unload the dishwasher (which include his dishes), or take out the trash, or replace the paper towel roll, once he's used it. I also feel frustrated and resentful that Jack bugs me to drive him places that he could take public transportation to (he has a card to use free public transport). I know some of these things are related to his age and disabilities, but it also seems kind of ridiculous.

Should I have to explain to someone that they should offer to help/not free load? Is expecting him to offer ableist? Is it appropriate or fair for me to resent an autistic person for that? Should I let that resentment keep me from offering him a place to stay for a couple more months?

For the most part, we get along great but my step son has a bad habit of always talking about his mother, the ex wife. He literally can't say one sentence without the words ""my mom""!

My husband has asked him dozens of times to not talk about her when they are at our house. The visitation schedule is one week on, one week off for his kids and my 13 year old. Besides that, they don't have common courtesy or good etiquette when eating or socializing.

For example, his 18 year old eats like he has never seen food before, like a Neanderthal! He interrupts me and others constantly when we're speaking. If I say, ""hello"" when they come home, they never respond back which I feel is very rude. My husband makes excuses for them and blames it on their generation. My boys on the other hand are very polite, respectful and speak when spoken to.

22,1fljg4x,AITA for telling my mom I won’t clean mine and my brothers bathroom after I just moved in?,"For context, after moving out a year ago and getting married, me and my husband just moved in with my parents a few days ago. Not over financial issues of any sorts but because my parents do work constantly and so does my husband, we all thought it would be best to help eachother out with bills while I stayed at home continuing my studies and helped do most of the chores around the house.
After moving in to my old room and taking a look at the bathroom I realized my little brother, who is 17, almost 18 hadn’t cleaned the bathroom at all since I had left.

I told her that my brother should have been responsible enough to keep his areas clean just as I did when I was his age, but she said it wasn’t his problem anymore.

23,1fljaed,AITA for not inviting my uncle to my wedding? ,"Throwaway because my real account would doxx me. 

I (27f) got married a couple of years ago. I’ve never been a wedding type of gal, and I was pregnant, so we were planning to elope. Of course, my family was super offended by this, and we compromised on a small wedding at the beach. Originally, the guest list was under 10 people, but by the time we’d included all of our “must haves” it was closer to 30. 

One person who was not on the list was my uncle, Charlie (60m). Charlie and I have had issues for as long as I can remember. I’m close with my cousin, his daughter, who he’s estranged with and verbally abusive to. He’s cruel to all the women in my family, probably a narcissist, and frankly we just butt heads. He’s one of those men who comes off as super charming and charismatic, but I’ve always seen right through it. At the time of my wedding, I had not seen or spoken to Charlie in over 5 years. I had, however, heard of his repeated cruelty to my family members. Example include: Refusing to attend his daughter’s white coat ceremony because she was using a different last name, bursting out and calling my sister a whore for little to no reason, constantly talking to people about how much he disliked me, etc. 

I wanted my wedding to be small and extremely intimate. I wanted to feel good about everyone who witnessed. Thus, Charlie was not invited. 

Chaos ensued. I was 12 weeks pregnant, constantly vomiting, stressed about planning a wedding I didn’t want in the first place… and all my family could talk about was CHARLIE. People called me, crying (literally), begging me to include Charlie. Suddenly, my pregnancy and wedding shifted to focus on Charlie. I didn’t relent, though. Finally, just before the wedding, Charlie sent a mass email to my entire family about how much he hated me, calling me evil, wishing ill upon me, etc. 

The wedding proceeded, sans Charlie. 

Now, I have a wonderful marriage, a toddler and another on the way, and the topic of Charlie STILL comes up regularly. He refuses to be in the same room as me. My family acts at though I’ve started some kind of war. Like I’m the problem. While I admit that the decision to not invite him was largely motivated by spite and how Charlie had treated me in the past, I still think I had the right to choose who came to my wedding. But, after all these years, I’m starting to wonder if I’m the problem. 

So, Reddit… AITA for not inviting my uncle to my wedding? Or, conversely, is my family the asshole for making my wedding and pregnancy all about Charlie?

24,1flj2zy,AITA for getting a babysitter because my mom was keeping her home,"I'm a single mom with a 4 year old daughter, Anna. Anna and I live with my mom. We both work and Anna goes to daycare full time. Daycare would be about half my income so I get a subsidy that covers $1400 out of her $2000 tuition. The only condition of the subsidy is that she actually has to show up. If she misses too many days I lose the subsidy. I go to work at 7:30 and daycare opens at 8 so my mom would be the one to take Anna to daycare. 

Anna's main teacher is a 20/21 year old girl. When I've talked to her she's always been very animated and energetic. She's great with the kids. Anna always comes home saying this teacher brought stickers, she brought juice, she brought bubbles, she did face painting, etc. and always has fun crafts that she did with her teacher. This teacher is her favorite person in the world right now and Anna often runs away from my mom to jump on this teacher in the mornings and hides when my mom picks her up because she doesn't want to leave this teacher.

My mom started to get jealous that Anna likes the teacher better than her so she started keeping her home from daycare on her days off/when she only has 1-2 easy clients (she cleans houses). 

I found out Anna missed 5 days over the past 3 weeks. I asked my mom about it and she told me she wanted Anna to spend more time with family instead of with teachers I told my mom Anna needs to be in daycare unless she's sick or I would lose the subsidy. She was arguing that if Anna needs to be in daycare, she should be in one with more family values and not some ""rich white girl trying to save the poor kids"" (the teacher is a girl from a well off family marrying into a well off family and the daycare isn't in the most well off neighborhood.) She has bins full of clothes for the kids, gave everyone a water bottle with their name on it, has a much nicer classroom than the other teachers, and drives a car worth more than my mom and I combined could make in a year. She's setting up a field trip to the local airport so her fiance can talk to the kids about flying planes and so they can look at his jet. I told her I wouldn't. This is the best daycare that takes this subsidy and I won't be moving her just because she's jealous. 

She was still insisting on Anna either being with family or being in a more family based daycare so I got her a babysitter. I drop her off to my neighbor at 7:30 when I leave for work and she drops Anna off at 8:15 on her way to take her kids to school. She only charges me $10 a day. I don't love the breakfasts that she gives Anna but I know she's going to daycare and I won't lose the subsidy.

I don't love the breakfasts that she gives Anna but I know she's going to daycare and I won't lose the subsidy.

I went from having 2 jobs to having 1, but i am constantly at work. he spends his days on video games, and i see no personal growth. He lives with his parents, and they have plenty of money. 

He is too comfortable and does not go to college or learn a trade, and is comfortable letting his parents support him, which i am not comfortable with. 

I am beyond happy he has a stable home and his parents are his support system, but he has no bills or anything he pays for and i never had that, which makes me a bit envious but i never make him feel bad for having that. 

I am constantly thinking of the future, so realizing without the support of his parents, he wouldn’t be able to support him self put me in a position of doubt. 

I dont expect him to move out, i just want him to make his own money. I always pay when we go out and when he tries to pay its with his moms card, and i expressed i am not comfortable with that regardless of how much they make.

26,1flijmt,AITA for refusing to interact with my niece when I don’t feel like it?,"
My (18M) niece (2) sits beside me at the table for meals, and a lot of the time she tries to grab my attention by looking at me or speaking to me, but I don’t like to speak while I’m eating so most of the time I kind of just blank her out. But when I don’t speak to her my sister and mother always tell me not to ignore her and say stuff like “don’t just stare at her, speak to her” or “acknowledge her” and I essentially get told off for it. It’s not just during meals though, if she’s speaking to me at any time and I don’t feel like interacting with her I just don’t react to her. 

And I also get guilt tripped for not wanting to play with her like yesterday she wanted to go outside and my sister told me to go outside and play with her and I said no because I didn’t want to, and she said “it literally doesn’t affect your life at all, why don’t you want to spend time with her”. And when I am 'playing’ with her it’s just awkward because I don’t know how speak to children. 

I don’t really care about being told to speak to her but what really gets me is when my sister tells her daughter that I don’t like her and stuff like that. For example last week my neice was saying my name over and over again and I replied once and then ignored her, and my sister said to her in front of me “___ is being an asshole and doesn’t want to speak to you”, which pissed me off so I said to her can you stop telling her I don’t want to speak to her or like her, and she was like “it’s true though you never want to speak to her or play with her”.

27,1fliijt,AITA for eating my birthday dinner w/friends and not telling my girlfriend food was ready when she was in the same house,"Last weekend was my birthday. I (38M) was supposed to go over to my girlfriend's (42F) an 1 hr away but instead asked her to come to mine. I work on Saturdays and didn't want to drive. I rent from an older couple who are doctors and I'm friendly with them and their daughter & son-in-law. They hadn't realized it was my B-day that day (Sat) and when I saw them they said maybe we could do dinner together Sunday. I told my girlfriend about it when she got to my place and she said it was a good idea.

Now I'm a terrible planner and forgot about it kind of until we were at a festival the next day (Sunday). We got hungry and she asked about dinner and eating with the family that rents to me. That's when I realized I dropped the ball. I texted them and we agreed on burgers at the house. We were so hungry we ate a snack to hold us. She was especially hungry because she's doing this crazy race in a couple of weeks and on Saturdays she trains like 7 hrs at peak level. So I know she is starving and we haven't eaten much all day.

We get to the house and she went to the bedroom that I rent to relax a bit. The landlords are setting up the backyard so I go help and hang out too. Then I go make myself a drink and peek in the bedroom to see if she wants a drink too. She says not yet, but maybe later. I got back to helping setup and continued drinking. They then started to grill and I go inside and check on her, and I say they started to cook and food will take a while. She said great, she'd be out in a few mins and just wanted to rest a bit more.

Here is where I might be the ahole. I didn't say then that food was basically ready. I went back outside and about 10 mins later food was ready. We all sat down outside and my girlfriend didn't come out. I texted and called her but my call went to voicemail. I decided to not go get her and we all ate without her. After dinner they wanted to cut the cake. I went inside to check on my girlfriend, saw she was actually asleep, didn't wake her and walked out. I'm walking to the backyard as she calls me on the phone, groggily asking if food was ready. I laughed and told her we had already eaten but she was on time for the cake. She asked why I didn't get her and then said she'd come and was just getting her shoes on. I got to the backyard and they were already moving inside to get the cake, so I went back to my room and she was putting on her shoes and wrapping up a call. Right then, they all came down the basement singing Happy Birthday. My girlfriend was still on the phone, getting her shoes on, and rushing to sing to me. I could tell she was upset. We cut the cake but my girlfriend was upset and didn't mingle with us.

We fought later and she said she felt excluded and that it didn't matter to me if she was part of dinner and cake cutting or not.

She gets some money from odd jobs, and travels constantly usually by hitchhiking, I know she's ridden freight trains before too. I see her a few times per year and she always has some good stories, but for the most part I don't understand why she wants to live like that.

We're from the same town so I've known her since high school, admittedly she had a tough home life so it makes sense that she left like this. I moved to a city for university after school and I've worked hard and got a well paying office job. We've kept in touch and I always assumed she'd settle down eventually and get a proper job etc, but it hasn't happened yet. Tbh I also think we'd be a good fit romantically so I'd like her to stay in my city more.

Last week she came by to visit, and she had a dog with her (a bull terrier named Gulliver). She said she'd got it off another homeless guy a couple of months ago, it had been travelling with her and she said she intends to keep him. I said I didn't think that was a good lifestyle for a dog, she's usually sleeping rough, moving from place to place constantly and spends as little as possible on food. She said it's normal for travellers to have dogs, they're fine living outdoors and she feels safer having him. (To be fair she did confirm the dog had had a rabies shot and it didn't look underfed, but still she hasn't had it for long). Which lead to me reminding her this isn't a safe lifestyle for her either and she's going to regret not having any employable skills one day.

I told her that her and the dog could move in with me. (On the sofa, I don't think I should try and ask her out yet) I wouldn't even expect her to pay rent, she could do odd jobs around the flat and start learning a trade job in my city.

Plus, I want my wedding day to be about me and my partner, not dealing with crying kids during the ceremony or a toddler meltdown during dinner.

Now, here’s where it escalates. She threatened not to come at all if I don’t let her bring her kids. I told her that’s her choice, but I’m not changing my rules for anyone, not even family.

She gaslit me and said that she’s not gonna message me anymore for anything ever, not even for her dog or whatever she needs moving forward.

33,1flhs1g,AITA for making my son move into a house i helped pay for?,"I have a daughter and 2 sons from my ex. My sons are 31 and 35 and my daughter is 29.

My eldest and daughter have their own places. My daughter lives alone in a 3 bed and has openly said she doesn't want a family and is unlikely to ever get married after having dated ah's. She owns the place and has a very good salary as she is an engineer.

My younger son is married and has a 2 year old with another kid on the way.

My elder son lived with me and doesn't work. He has struggled with depression and is significantly overweight to the point of needing help getting bathed. Because of this his health isn't the best and he can't find a job. He cannot stand for long and when he tried working fast food it didn't work out. He doesn't have a high school diploma which makes things harder.

My girlfriend has expressed wanting to move in with me but for privacy she wants my son to move out first.

Since I helped out with my daughter's down-payment I thought it would be reasonable to ask my daughter to take him in. I could tell she wasn't very happy about it but she eventually agreed. I said I'd find some hired help for bathing him.

I dropped him off there and it has only been 2 weeks and she is now upset at me and arguing with me to take him back. I haven't yet found the hired help and she is upset he hasn't bathed properly and says he is a slob and doesn't do any chores. While he does eat a lot I've not really found him to be a slob and my housekeeper hasn't ever complained about it. I think she is exagerating and her main issue is that she is embarassed of being seen with him as I know the past 2 weeks she didnt have her friends over on the weekends like she normally does and she told my niece she doesnt want to with him around.

She suggested having him go to her other brother's place but that's not realistic as he has a wife and infants and even splitting his time there would be difficult. She also lives closer to me so it is easier for me to help out.

I refused to do so and reminded her that I helped her with the down-payment.She said she'd pay me back and can do so right now if i want to but that's still help since she didnt have the funds back then and I'm not taking any interest on it.

The problem began when my nearest neighbor started dating a local junkie. This particular junkie just happens to be someone my wife and I knew back in high school, and somehow she found out the house was ours.  

Thursday, my dog Ollie was going INSANE at one of the windows. I look out and see a person wearing a hoodie, with the hood pulled up over a baseball hat, carrying a backpack, and multiple bigger duffle bags, with their hands cupped over their eyes, looking in the window.  At the same time my MIL was just pulling down the driveway to drop off my child after work.

I grabbed the 9mm from the safe, holster it, and head out. Once I get everyone inside, I walk around the corner and shout ""Hey! What are you doing over there!"" Methany jumps and turns.

She was twitching, rocking, stuttering and picking, as she tried to ask if we were home. 

I told her she was on private property & asked how she managed to miss the no trespassing signs. She just kept asking if I was home. I told her I was me, and to leave my property. 

She started cussing me out, calling my kid the devil, etc.  She kept ranting, saying she knows me, and I wasn't me. Instead, I was a demon that took over my body. She started to stomp towards me, digging around in one of the big bags she was carrying. I dropped my hand down to my holster & told her she was trespassing, and to leave now. I'm a big guy, & I was using my big boy voice. I said I wasn't going to tell her again. She kept cussing me out, calling me a demon, talking about the devil living in my house, but she turned and walked away. That was visit 1. 

Around 9pm Friday there's a knock at the door. 

Methany again. Long story short, she tells me she needs a ride, but no one will take her anywhere. I let her use my phone so she can call for a ride. She does, then says she is going to drop something off, but she'd be back later to hang out. I told her ""Don't come back here. You need to find someplace else to go. I hope you get where you need to be, and I don't think his house is it, but my house isn't it either. Half of my own family doesn't even know where I live."" Off she goes. 

She shows back up at 7 am. So I step out again, & ask her why she's back, and if she knows what no trespassing means. She said she just wanted to come in and hang out with my wife, and to thank me for the phone last night. 

I tell her she's welcome for the phone, but no. She needs to leave, and not come back, and if she does I will be calling the police for criminal trespassing. She left, whisper mumbling the whole way about how I didn't have to be so mean.

35,1flhmo4,AITA Concert Tickets Drama with Ex- Boyfriend,"UPDATE: I reached out to him and my friend apologizing and my friend understood and I paid her back. I haven’t decided if I’m going to the concert with him but I sent his ticket back. Thanks for calling out my BS.

Hi Reddit,

I’ve been struggling with something involving my ex-boyfriend and concert tickets we bought months ago while we were still together. Our breakup was amicable; we cared about each other, but for reasons I won’t get into, we decided to part ways and agreed to stay friends.

Before we broke up, we had bought tickets to two upcoming shows. After the breakup, we decided we’d still go together as friends. But over time, I started feeling uncomfortable about going to these concerts with my ex, especially since the themes are all about love and sex. So, I offered him my ticket for the first show and asked if he could pay me for it. At first, he wasn’t on board, but he eventually agreed. I decided to let him go to that concert, even though the artist is one of my favorites, because I knew how badly he wanted to go.

Now, the issue is with the second concert. I’ve realized I’m not comfortable going with him anymore, even though we initially agreed to. So, I told him I’d pay him for his ticket and take them both, since I already gave up my first ticket and didn’t want to miss out on both shows. Just to clarify, when I gave up the first ticket, I wasn’t planning to take the second one later.

He didn’t handle this well and basically told me not to make things ugly. He said the only way he’d be okay with it—and not show up at my place on the day of the concert—was if I bought him two tickets in our section. I thought that was unreasonable, especially since tickets in our section had increased in value, and there were still decent seats available elsewhere for just a bit more than we paid.

After going back and forth with no resolution, I ended up sending him the money, thinking that would settle it. But he kept texting and calling, saying he didn’t want the money and demanding his ticket back, which is right next to mine. It’s worth mentioning that he’s financially well off and could easily buy a ticket in another section, but he doesn’t seem to care about that, even if it means sitting with me. Since then, I haven’t heard from him for a week.

I asked my friend if she’d go with me, and without hesitation, she paid me for the ticket that was originally his. I’m excited to go, but now the whole experience feels tainted. I’m not even sure if I’ll enjoy it because I feel guilty about how everything went down.

Am I the asshole here? I genuinely hope he still finds a way to go. I don’t want to ruin it for him, but I’ve been a people-pleaser my whole life and I’m trying to take more control over my choices. Still, this has been really stressful, and I’m having trouble seeing things clearly.

36,1flhk72,AITA for telling my friend she’s a moron? ,"I (30m) have two friends, Mike (31m) and Casey (30f), who have been dating for two and a half years. Long story short, Casey called me yesterday in hysterics claiming that Mike had “basically admitted to wanting to cheat on her”. When I got her calm enough to actually explain she told me that they were watching an episode of The Big Bang Theory, in which they were talking about the multiverse theory.

For those who don’t know, the multiverse theory states that there are an infinite number of universes with an infinite number of outcomes in each. For example, in this exact moment in two separate universes, one of you is driving to work while another of you just got in to a car accident on your way to work. 

Apparently Casey made a comment about how “even with infinite universes, she knows they’d always be together”. Mike apparently laughed and said it was a cute idea but in reality there would be universes where they broke up, never met or weren’t even alive. Casey took that to mean that Mike is secretly attracted to other women and flipped out on him before storming out of his apartment. She started going on about how she thinks she needs to break up with Mike if this is how he “really feels about her.” 

I was kind of in a stunned silence before blurting out “you’re a moron”, without thinking. Casey immediately went off on me to which I kinda snapped back and said are you drunk or something, you’re about to break up with someone over a hypothetical universe that may or may not exist! She immediately hung up on me.

I found out today that she reached out to several other people in our friend group with the same story and all of them, in a more polite way, basically said what I said. Now she’s not speaking to any of us. Our friend group has agreed that she’s clearly having some kind of break down over something but that also I was personally out of line with how I phrased what I said to her. I know what I said was the truth but AITAH for how I phrased it?

Neither of our parents were there for us, so she had to act like a mother to us despite being a child herself. She never had time for studying, socialising, or hobbies, and both her grades and her mental health were greatly affected. She started working at age 13 and dropped out of school at 16 to work full time to support us. Due to her childhood, she can’t handle being around children at all. They trigger her trauma, and she starts crying, panicking, and having anxiety attacks. We’ve all tried to be supportive of her.

The thing is, between the five of us, we have 16 children aged between 7 months and 12 years.

She would complain every time we refused to have a child free event and say we need to include her more. Eventually, we stopped inviting her to events.

My sister was furious with us for excluding her. She called us ungrateful for sacrificing her childhood to raise us.

We’ll call him ‘Jake’. I was the GM of a restaurant & I made a new friend, We’ll call her ‘Holly’. Holly was training me so we spent a lot of time together. 15 hour shifts 6 days a week. We became really good friends & I really enjoyed having a friend again outside of my marriage. She made comments to my husband like ‘I’m gonna steal your wife’ ‘I love your wife more than you do’ ‘she’s my girlfriend’ things like that. Jake laughed it off as did I as it seemed to be a joke. She did things like get the same exact swimsuit as me in a different color. Or the same dress in a different color without telling me. We would just meet up & be twins. She borrowed $200 from us & never paid us back. She always showed up late to hang out. It’s the week of my birthday. it fell on a Sunday. I get a text on Wed from Jake saying ‘Holly texted me asking if she could have you over on Saturday night’ I already told her that Jake & I had plans but didn’t know what. Her & I would have to hang a different time & how did she get Jake’s number?! We were weirded out. Jake told her the same thing that we had plans but werent sure what. i had him tell her the only time that would work was Saturday morning until 2. He told her & she didn’t respond. She texted me & asked what I was doing tomorrow (Friday). I said I’m not sure why? Knowing damn well she was gonna ask for something but trying to play it off.

I said ‘are husbands allowed?’ She said ‘I was hoping we could just have girl time & I want you to come over for food & drinks & spend the night.’ I asked if her husband & kid were going to be there & she said yes.

I told her I don’t know if I could continue the friendship if she couldn’t respect my decision & we didn’t talk very much after that.

She said that she could never do that to a fellow passenger. He said that was her choice, but all the seats recline, barring the last row, and they could all recline if they so wished.

42,1flfzo9,AITA for not sharing my notes with a classmate because they don’t pay attention? ,"Long time lurker, first time poster. Genuinely curious to hear everyone’s thoughts since this is the kind of low-level problem I think AITA is great for. Fake names and some minor details changed for privacy. 

I (22F) am in my senior year of college and am taking an upper-division English course (I’m an English major). On the first day of class, a guy sat next to me and introduced himself as Ken. Ken’s a computer science major and was only taking this course for his required humanities credit, so he was looking for friends to study with. I participate a lot in class and over the next couple days, Ken kept complimenting me after class saying how good my contributions were and how neat my notes looked. He also continuously complained how confused he was, but here’s the kicker. Ken does NOT pay attention in class. Whenever I would glance at him, he’d always be on his phone, scrolling through Snapchat or Instagram or some other social media site. To me, if you’re confused in a class but are always on your phone or otherwise not staying focused, it’s partially your fault. I kept offering to go over the material outside of class with him, but he would brush me off, claiming he was busy. 

The primary issue arose yesterday. After class, Ken turned to me and asked if I could share my notes with him because he didn’t understand anything the professor was talking about and wanted to prepare for the midterm essays we have to write. I nicely told him no, explaining that I worked hard on my notes and wouldn’t give them away for free just for him to constantly be on his phone. I said while I’m happy to help him study, I’m not going to take the class for him. Ken seemed really offended and just sort of left without saying anything. 

I didn’t think I was the asshole until later, when I was relaying the situation to a friend. She just looked at me weird and said there was no harm in sharing my notes since the class isn’t curved, and I’m just making his life harder. She also said that he might have a learning disability that makes it difficult for him to pay attention and I was being unnecessarily cruel to someone who was probably struggling a lot. I defended myself by saying that even if it technically doesn’t hurt me in any way, I just feel taken advantage of because he’s clearly not even trying and expecting to reap the fruits of my labor. My friend just rolled her eyes and changed the topic.

However, the second flight ended up being cancelled. The next available flight wasn’t until 2 pm the next day, so we would have to wait around 17 hours. The passengers were allowed to stay in nearby hotels for free.

Instead, she had to stay within a specific area of the airport that had these bright ceiling lights that would stay on 24/7.

I had the option to stay with her, but I chose to go to the hotel instead. She was furious with me, accusing me of being a fake friend.

My family is planning a vacation in October. A week-long trip to a cabin upstate owned by a family friend. The trip is in the middle of the semester, and I said I can’t go because of school. One of my older siblings got really mad at this and told me to skip class that week. I said I wasn’t comfortable doing that. In all honesty, I didn’t wanna go on the trip anyway - I’d rather stay home alone, even if I didn’t have class. After some back and forth, my sibling seemed to accept what I had said and I thought that was the end of it.

Yesterday, I found out my sibling got the contact details of my professors, called them, and asked if it would be okay for me to skip class that week. They said it was a once in a lifetime opportunity with family from out of the country coming to visit, including elderly relatives who we may never see again. I guess the sob story worked because my professors explained their attendance policies and said it would be fine for me to skip that week, provided I catch up with the assignments and classes online.

For the record, there is no extended family from out of the country, and no elderly relatives will be coming. The group will be the same people I’ll be seeing later this year for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Admittedly they will be celebrating a few significant birthdays and anniversaries that have happened this year, but that’s the only obvious special thing happening.

When my sibling told me about these phone calls, they did so in front of my parents, and said it all worked out because it meant I could come after all. I admit I blew up at them which I shouldn’t have done, and yelled that they shouldn’t have invaded my privacy and contacted professors as it has probably made them see me as a child looking to skip class, which is not the impression I want to make.

","So, my girlfriend Lisy (26F) is absolutely amazing. She’s Dominican, incredibly beautiful, and she's even learning Greek because of me (I'm Greek). We've been together for about a year now, and things are going great.

Recently, though, she’s been wanting to spend more time at her place rather than mine. It’s not like I don’t enjoy going over to hers – her place is super cozy, and I totally get why she feels comfortable there. But we’ve spent more time at my apartment in the past, and I kind of miss having her around here.

It’s not like I’m controlling where we spend time, but it feels like she’s pulling away from hanging out at my place, and I’m starting to feel a little bad about it. She says it’s just because she’s got a lot of things at her place that she needs to take care of (which makes sense), but I’m left wondering if there’s something I’m doing wrong.",No A-holes here,2024-09-20,"AITA for asking my girlfriend if we can spend more time at my place?

I asked her for the WiFi password so I could use WhatsApp to contact my parents (for some reason iMessage wasn’t working in that country), and she told me she had more important things to worry about than the WiFi password.

51,1flel0m,AITA for buying myself this gift?,"I’m currently on vacation with my husband and his parents in a part of the world that is famous for producing really beautiful and high quality leather goods. We visited a city which has a shop which is particularly well-known for leather goods and I had made a specific plan to visit. When my MIL heard that I was going she wanted to go too. 

We had a good browse around the shop and my MIL asked me if there was anything in particular I liked. I mentioned that I particularly loved a particular range of accessories in blue leather, pointing out a luggage tag and passport holder. MIL then told me she would get them for me for Christmas, but that I had to promise to ‘forget’ she had bought them. I said thank you, that’s so kind etc and she went to pay. 

I browsed for a few minutes more and then decided I was going to get myself a pair of gloves from the same range. My MIL met me at the checkout just as I was paying. She asked if I was getting a gift for someone and I said I was buying myself some gloves.

After that for the rest of the day she was a little cool and standoffish with me, which is unusual because we generally get on well. I eventually asked my husband if he could talk to her to find out what was wrong. He spoke to her and then told me she felt that it had been a little rude and disrespectful of me to buy myself something from the leather shop when I knew she had already bought me something. She felt that she was treating me so that I didn’t have to spend my own money, and that it was a slap in the face that I told her I wanted one thing and then bought myself something else in addition. She felt it was something like entitled behaviour on my part to use her generosity as an opportunity to get more things. 

I feel somewhat blindsided by this because it had not occurred to me that my behaviour could be viewed as disrespectful. The shop was expensive and I specifically mentioned the luggage tag or the passport holder as things I liked because they were the cheapest things there. I would never have told her I liked the gloves because they were far too expensive to expect as a gift. As far as I was concerned her purchase and mine were totally separate - I didn’t expect hers and was just grateful that she was being so generous, but I didn’t think it meant I should forego getting what I really wanted for myself. 

My husband thinks it’s not a big deal and that I didn’t do anything wrong, and that I should just let it blow over. But I don’t know if I should apologise and clear the air. My MIL is a nice woman and not prone to being difficult, so I don’t want there to be any bad feeling. I would be interested to know if others think there is something I should apologise for since she’s usually very reasonable and easy going.

Context matters, so what lead up to this encounter? I'm a distance runner and was running at a park here that has a fairly wide trail. You could easily fit 6 people shoulder to shoulder on it. I see two ladies off in the distance, about a quarter mile up the trail, they are walking and talking and enjoying a lovely afternoon out together. Oh and they have two relatively large dogs, I'm clueless on the breeds sorry. The people are walking on the right side of the trail, but their two dogs are off the trail to their left, my right, and not on leashes. Meaning I would be running in-between them and their dogs. Most people understand the unpredictability of their dog's reactions around a random sweaty guy running straight at them and will at least try to get their dogs over to their side of the trail or at least out of the lane of someone passing. And even if they have the best doggos in the world, it's still, I don't know what the right word is, polite?



So what do these two lovely ladies do? Absolutely nothing. They can easily see me down the trail, and have plenty of time to tell their dogs to get over and they choose to carry on their conversation. So what happens when I get basically right up to them on the trail. Their dogs rush over from off the trail in front of me, blocking my way, acting like they don't know what to do, one of them walks towards the owner, the other kinda freezes in the trail making a motion like it could go left or right. My solution? I just ran off the trail around the whole situation versus trying to bob and weave between two dogs and their clueless owners. I also need to add at this point that it had rained earlier that morning, so around the trail was more mud than grass. It's at this point, in the few seconds of this whole interaction of me sloshing through the mud, looking over at these two women who are completely ignoring this entire thing laughing and chatting like good ol pals, that I shout at them ""Don't worry about a leash or anything!"" and raise both my palms up gesturing in front of me like 'really'? They say literally nothing and look a little surprised, and I just shook my head while running by.



With all that being said, I can't shake the feeling that I probably ruined their day at the park. These two old friends just out chatting, probably very nice people, getting some sun, walking their dogs, trying to live a healthier life and some random dude at the park blows past them sloshing in the mud and yells at them for not minding their dogs.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-20,"AITA for yelling at two women at the park for not walking their dogs on leashes?

A couple of months pass and it’s the start of the semester at university. It had been a while since I had seen my friends - both F and bisexual.

They asked me to go to the toilet and flash them because they wanted to see how much bigger my breasts had gotten. I did not think anything of this and gave them both a quick flash in the bathroom.

She said I had disrespected her and she didn’t like it, as it’s not something she does with her friends and she had previously mentioned how she did not like me being naked around my friends or vise versa. 
I do not agree with her on this topic. For me it’s just harmless fun with the girls. Whereas for her it’s disrespectful. 

So AITA? I still don’t believe I am in the wrong but I told her I would no longer get naked in-front of my friends or they get naked in-front of me. ",1.0,0.982919,1,1
57,1fldes2,AITA for asking my boyfriend (41M) to watch the dogs?,"There are a lot of components to this and I am going to try and give them all so it is completely understood. I (27F) have a birthday coming up. My boyfriend (41M) and I planned a trip to San Antonio. Part of the trip was going to be a present to me but I was also going to help pay. We have two dogs so they needed to be boarded while we were out of town which would have cost a couple a hundred, with a hundred here and there for hotel, food, etc. A big part of this is understanding that he works for an airline so we fly places no cost. 

We were set to leave today, Friday, but this past Tuesday, my dog had a freak accident and ended up in the animal hospital. He is ok and recovered well but the event cost about $2700. I cancelled our trip because that was not a cost I was anticipating and didn't feel like it was the right financial decision to take a several hundred dollar trip after that OR leave my dog that was just hospitalized at a kennel. 

I was really disappointed about the cancelled trip, scary dog event, my car had also broken down Wednesday (another $700 dollars unanticipated), and I am feeling the birthday pressure of not feeling like I am not in the place I thought I would be at this point. On top of that, BF and I have been kind of rocky. We just entered our 3rd year together and are feeling some growing pains, so while I was excited to go on initial trip together, it did feel a little forced.

She knew I had been having a hard week and thought it may be a nice way to move past it and have some fun at a much lower financial cost. I asked my BF how he felt about it and he blew up at me.

58,1fldcqy,AITA Our neighbors well dried up and we cut them off from using our water,"AITA Our neighbors well dried up and we cut them off from using our water.

We live in a suburban country neighborhood (USA). All the homes are on well / septic. There are original 1960's ranchers with a few newer larger 90's homes sprinkled throughout. We're in a newer 90's house and the neighbors are in one of the original homes. We each have two low yield wells and one of theirs has been dried up since before they bought the home.

Last week their good well stopped working and they asked my Wife if they could fill up buckets for their animals (more on this later) and garden. In the vein of being a good neighbor she naturally said yes. They've had a well company out and have been messing with both their wells on their own. But these past few days there's been no work being done and they've provided no update. My wife asked what was up the other day and they said that they have basically been getting the run around by various well companies and they don't have time to pursue this harder. Everyday it's multiple 5 gallon buckets in the morning and evening that they're filling with our hose. Probably 20-30 gallons each fill up.

It's 2 adults and 8 kids in their home, a large garden and a large (illegal) number of chickens and turkeys. They've clearly brought this on themselves with heavy irresponsible water use. 

They have a bunch of roosters that are not legal and are driving the neighborhood crazy. So I've been kind of irritated that we're supporting the obnoxious rooster operation. Also obviously worried the increase use on our aquifer will mess our water flow up. But it's pretty cold to say ""Hey you can't fill up your buckets any more, your on your own"" so we've been wrestling with what to do.

Yesterday they had an older lady walking around their yard yelling and praying for the wells to open up. This was the last straw for us. In my opinion this is a serious problem that requires a serious, timely solution and they've got a lady basically doing a rain dance. 

Last night my Wife told the Mom next door that we can't provide water any more and that we could give them another 24hrs of water use to figure it out and the Mom got upset and walked away from my Wife while she was speaking to her. Which makes us feel better about our choice, basically F them, they're rude and ungrateful but again still obviously we feel bad about cutting off a house full of kids from water use. Also none of the other neighbors are going to help because they're upset about the roosters so they're on their own now. AITAH?

I am a male (rather not say my age for privacy reasons) and I’ve been working at McDonald’s since January, i do front counter and have been put on fries for almost all my time there and only just recently moved to register with new colleagues.

A week or two ago, one of my colleagues didn’t know how to add a burger to a meal and asked me for help, (our manager was busy) and because i don’t know how to say no i accepted and decided to help her. The customers kept asking if we had finished their order and then began to complain so i looked at them and told them to wait a bit more. I now understand this may have caused a spark between us and she grunted.

A few seconds later she started complaining that it took three people and 6 minutes to do one simple order. I had already had a horrible start to my shift and couldn’t handle her anymore so i yelled at her. I remember telling her that instead of relying on teenagers to make her food why can’t she go home and cook for herself like a normal person. 

This obviously riled her up and we got into an argument which ended up with me yelling at her to f*ck off. I understand that i may have overreacted but she kept bugging me asking how much longer and etc.

60,1fld2ua,AITA for telling my (F24) friend its her fault she (f23) hasn't been on a date? ,"throw away bc she knows about my main account

Around June of this year my friend confided in me and told me that she has never been on a date, has never been kissed, and has never been intimate. She told me she felt really insecure about all of this and was convinced that men did not like her enough to be with her, especially if they knew she was a ""virgin"". 

I comforted her and told her that nobody would care if she was had never been with anyone and was in no way required to tell a man her dating history anyways. We talked a lot about putting herself out there and going out more and building confidence etc. She expressed to me that she was ready to date! 

I tend to keep my social life pretty busy, going out a lot, travelling for the weekends when I can, hosting group hang outs and what not. I took to inviting her to more of these events than before, even with the friend circles she was not as familiar with. I even straight up introduced her to a guy friend that I thought was her type. 

Well last night she asked me to come over and then *sobbed* about how unlovable she was and how nobody wants her. I then asked her if she has been talking with people when we go out, if she has been flirting, if she was even on dating apps. She said NO to all of these. I was like well wait a minute I thought you said you were wanting to date it doesn't sound like you've been *trying* to date? I asked her if anything happened with the guy friend I introduced her to and she said he didn't seem interested in her when they spoke *one time*. 

At this point I am kind of baffled by her behavior, especially because she is a sobbing mess. I asked her what she expected to happen after we talked in June and she said she was disappointed that no men approached her in public flirting or anything. I said well you haven't approached men either and she said she's more comfortable if men approach because she's too nervous. 

I then told her that it was entirely her fault she wasn't getting dates because she wasn't even trying, which made her cry harder. I went on and told her that she needs to stop playing the ""nobody likes me"" excuse because she won't *even talk to men she likes*. She told me to get out of her apartment and then later texted me and told me that was the meanest thing anyone had ever said to her and she was reconsidering our friendship. I responded and told her that I cared for her but she needed a wake up call big time. 

This morning, I do feel bad for being so harsh, but I was so beyond frustrated after having this conversation for months and then finding out she wasn't even doing anything about it.

61,1fld179,AITA for refusing to let someone go first into the vets office despite their appointment being set before mine ,"Yesterday I (29F) took my puppy (7 months) to the vet's office due to an infection in her lymph nodes. The appointment was at 12:20, but due to some last minute emergency patients everything was running way behind schedule.

Almost 40 minutes later someone came in and when the front desk lady asked them the time of their appointment they answered ""12:10"", so she told them that their turn was just before mine.

That surprised me because they had arrived basically an hour late and I had been waiting for quite a lot. While I understand that it might have been out their control it still seemed unfair. 

I let them know that in the nicest way possible, but I think it was kind of obvious that I was slightly pissed off. After some awkward silence the trady agreed to go after me. Despite some dirty looks I didn't feel guilty at all. 

That was until I later talked about the situation with a couple of friends and they were divided, two of them thought it wouldn't have hurt to wait a little bit more and made me feel a little bit bad.

So, Aita?

Edit to add:

The front desk is right beside the waiting room, it's an open space. So when the person came in I and any other person that were to be present would have heard their conversation with any issues. This is how it went- 

The receptionist welcomed them and asked for the name of the pet and the time of the appointment, they answered ""12:10"". The lady told them, ""okay, you go before (my pet's name"". I chimed in ""hey, get that my appointment was after them (12:20) but I've been waiting here for about 40 minutes and it's almost 1 PM, I don't think this is fair"". Both of them looked at me for a moment and the person awkwardly said ""it's okay, I can't go after them"".

Neither of them mentioned at any moment that the person had called beforehand to warn the office about being late. Which I hope to grown adults would be able to respond to my argument and refute it. 

No one really asked for clarification, but many of you are arguing this point when there's 0 indication that it happened.

She lets her 4 year old destroy our living room which is a shared space and won’t clean up after him or teach him how to clean and it’s not like she had no time to clean it was 3 and a half weeks before I said anything I tried to openly communicate with her that things are getting out of control but she’s ignoring me every chance I get I even asked the other person In The house to ask them and within the first message started getting ignored too and it’s not like she’s busy she can post memes and other shit but can’t communicate with her roommates about a problem.

64,1flcgdr,AITA for not inviting friends to future events after they abadoned me at one?,"Last week a group of friends were planning to get dinner one night. I invite them all to an event afterwards that another group of friends invited me to (a DJ event at a cool venue, close to the dinner place). Jake, one of the dinner friends says ""Sure, I'd be down"". The rest don't respond.

The next day we go for drinks after dinner, before the DJ set starts. At the bar, Jake jokes with another friend (Jane) about going to a different club instead. The DJ set starts and I get up to go with Jake to the DJ venue. Two dinner friends (Alex and Jane) decide to come along for a drink, but they said they wouldn't stay long cause they're tired.

At the venue I meet with my other friends and we dance together. At one point Jane makes a very brief comment about the music (like ""what are they playing?""). Not long after, Jane tells me she's tired and they're leaving. We hug and say goodbye. Alex disappears, but I assume he left with Jane. Jake also disappeared. I text the group saying ""Jake, did you leave too? :("". This was maybe 40 minutes after we arrived.

About 15 minutes after, Alex messages the group saying they were at the metal club. Jake tell me to join them and I decline. But they continue to send me messages every so often about how much fun they were having and how they had real music and how much better it was.

I had fun the rest of the night at my event but was bothered that the group of friends I brought with me would all leave together to another party without telling me. I was particularly upset at Jake, who accepted my invitiation to come to my event, and then left as soon as there was a better thing he wanted to do.

I spoke the next morning to Jane about how I was upset. She was understanding and validating. But she shared her side. She says she had suggested the metal bar to me earlier, so that was my invitation to join them and I had said no. Also the repeated messages about how much better the club was was meant as playful banter to convince me to join them. I said I would never do this if I was invited to something, unless I was really truely miserable at an event.

We did end up talking it through and in the end it boiled down to: *people have different virtues and that's okay and it hurts when people don't reciprocate and for that they're sorry but what they did wasn't fundamentally wrong or rude*. I accept this but it's still not sitting super nicely with me so I wanted other people's opinion. At this point I don't feel like I will invite these friends to other parties/events in the future. Am I a petty asshole for holding other people to my standard?

TL;DR I invited some friends to an event. They got bored and all left together without telling me and partied somewhere else and then wrote me about how much more fun they were having.

66,1flcbb4,AITA for excluding an acquaintance from joining my birthday celebration?,"I (19f), just turned 19 yesterday. My close friends had a surprise party for me and today, I planned to treat them by buying them food and to hang out since one of my friends said that we should go out since we haven't for a while. 

This classmate of mine, let's say her name is melody, wanted to join us. Unfortunately, I didn't want to hang out with her because she is friends with someone who would talk bad about everyone I know behind their backs (Who also happens to hate me even when I treated her nice). It's just that the backstabbing girl who my friends and I had history with is kind of like Melody. Especially since the backstabbing girl first befriended Melody and my frriends and I notice how Melody is kinda like the backstabbing girl's variant.

Earlier, we were playing Monopoly and I am quite loud (I was playing to win and I also bankrupt Melody in the game) and Melody kept saying ""Oh, she's (me) my pet peeve"" and stuff. I was obviously upset and offended because we weren't close and weren't even friends in the first place. Later on, when we were going to go out after school, she wanted to join us since she really wanted to go to the place we were going to. Since I was going to treat my friends, they said that it was my choice. I obviously told them that I wasn't comfortable with Melody and the backstabbing girl celebrating with me. I kept saying that we didn't know if we would continue going to said place and they still kept close to us, so I didn't have nay choice but to tell the truth. I told them, ""It's just that It's my birthday celebration and I want to treat them (my friends)...I hope you don't get the wrong idea"".

Obviously they soon stopped wanting to join us and when we were going, my friends hugged her and as I was apologizing and telling her that I don't have any vendetta against her, she didn't accept my hug and acted mean to me. My friends and I had fun but It's just that one of my friends felt a little bit too sad. I asked if they were mad at me and said friend said that she felt bad for Melody. 

It just hurt me that it was like they chose this girl (who we know only for 2 months) over me. Now Melody is most likely spreading hate about me. Everytime I be myself around Melody it's as if she is judging me with the backstabbing girl despite Melody knowing how the backstabbing girl hurt everyone despite being treated good. I get Melody's point of view, and that it hurts to be left out since I experienced that too. But to act this way to a person you're not even close to? It just makes me sad. I mean, Melody wasn't even with us on the surprise party. Call it intuition if you like, but I just feel her jokes just don't feel like jokes but it's as if she actually means it. Now she's spreading about how annoying I am on her social media.

Am I the asshole for rejecting someone I am not friends with to join my birthday celebration?

There's always been tension between us, and it's rooted in her being a perpetual liar and someone who constantly tries to play the victim. For example, my most recent ex and I broke things off last November. Unbeknonwst to me, my mom was texting my ex behind my back, basically pressuring her into trying to fix things so we could get back together. Not something I wanted, and I told my mom that post break-up. I get a call from my ex at the time giving me the rundown about how my mom is calling/texting her several times a week about that topic. When I eventually brought it up to my mom, she fully denied it. She left her phone ublocked one day, I sent myself a ton of screenshots, showed her, and she tried to fabricate a story about how ""it's not what it seems."" I have several other big lies, and that's just regarding situations between me and her. She's also perpetually lied to my sister, and worst of all, my dad, where she has ultimately destroyed their marriage.

With all this in mind, yesterday my sister sent out a group text with my buddy, his GF, and me, trying to plan to go apple picking this saturday. We all said said yes, established a time. My sister then asked should she invite some other people, I told her no, keep it small. This was early in the afternoon. Later that night, she texted the group saying she invited more people, so I went downstairs to ask her why. At this point it was still calm, and she said that our mom said it would be unfair to invite some people but not the others. I then asked my mom why she said that, and naturally, she denied talking about it. I asked her why she was lying, she again, denied it. I started to get angry, then went to my sister, who fully confirmed what my mom had said to her about our plans. I then once again asked my mom why she lied, and naturally, she started to yell and cry, while also saying ""Get off my back, You have no idea what I'm going through."" I had enough at this point, so I yelled back, asking her why is it okay to lie to me about something so trivial, and that ""going through stuff"" isn't a valid excuse. She continued to deny that she didn't lie, then ran down into the basement, slamming every door possible. So, AMITA for getting angry because my mom lied?

TLDR: My mom is a perpetual liar, got caught in another lie, and I got angry about it, causing a fight to break out

EDIT: To clarify for some recurring comments. I still live at home, so cutting contact is not possible. Moving out would be a great thing to do, but financially speaking, it isn't possible, as I'm still in school finishing up my pre-reqs for med school, so most of my money goes towards funding tuition, books, public transport, all those things.

68,1flc8vc,AITA for defending my sisters relationship?,"I (27F) have been dating my boyfriend (28M) for about a year. He came to my sisters birthday dinner at my parents to meet my family for the first time recently and it’s caused a big fight between us. 

My sister (29F) is dating a married man. Her boyfriend, I’ll call him Ray, is in an arranged marriage that both he and his wife were unhappy with. They didn’t want to cause issues with their families, however, and agreed to be together for that image but they both date other people. The wife has had the same boyfriend for nearly a decade, and her husband has been dating my sister for like three years now.

Anyways, at her birthday dinner Ray couldn’t make it as his kid had some kind of recital or concert or something. He was brought up and my sister gushed about his birthday gift to her, and said she was actually going on a double date with his wife and her boyfriend soon. My boyfriend, I’ll call him Tyler, was visibly confused by this but didn’t say anything.

We had this conversation with him shortly before summer began. However, as Ben and I (as well as my other roommate) were not here over the summer and only Mike was (as he was doing summer school), I’m 99% sure he had Emma here constantly (which fair I guess none of us were there).

By some miracle, Ben told me that he was talking with Mike and Emma earlier this current semester and found out Emma was going to be moving a couple of hours away.

70,1flbw3y,AITA for cancelling a weekend away?,"My girlfriend and I had planned to go away this weekend. I have paid for the hotel which is non refundable and we've each paid for our own travel costs which is only £20 each. 

Unfortunately I received some bad news yesterday that my mum has been diagnosed with cancer. I don't live in the same town as my mum so I can't just go over whenever I want so I told her I'd come over as soon as I could.

I told my girlfriend we'd need to cancel our weekend away as I needed to go and see my mum. She asked if I had to go this weekend and I told her yeah since I need to see her as soon as I can. I said we can rearrange and do it another time. 

She mentioned the money that's been wasted but I pointed out most of it is my money anyway and my mum is more important that the cost of a hotel. She said there's nothing I can do anyway but I just told her that I can be there to support my mum.

I told her to go with a friend if it mattered that much to her but I'm going to spend the weekend with my mum and brother. She said I was being unfair not considering and prioritising her but I just said after the news I've had, my mum comes before a weekend away.

Unfortunately I received some bad news yesterday that my mum has been diagnosed with cancer. I don't live in the same town as my mum so I can't just go over whenever I want so I told her I'd come over as soon as I could.

I told my girlfriend we'd need to cancel our weekend away as I needed to go and see my mum. She asked if I had to go this weekend and I told her yeah since I need to see her as soon as I can. I said we can rearrange and do it another time. 

She mentioned the money that's been wasted but I pointed out most of it is my money anyway and my mum is more important that the cost of a hotel. She said there's nothing I can do anyway but I just told her that I can be there to support my mum.

71,1flbtcr,AITA for allowing my friend's new boyfriend to come to my wedding?,"Throwaway because both my friends know my reddit account.

I (33 M) am getting married to my fiancé in a couple of weeks and all my guests get a plus one, which is causing drama in our friend group.

Two of my close friends since college, lets call them Jane (35 F) and Mark (38 M), started dating (against my advice) a few years ago. Six months ago they had a messy break up which I made sure not to get the full details of because I did not want it to affect my friendship with either of them. All I made sure of is that neither of them cheated or abused the other, aside from that I asked them not to discuss the details of their break up with me. That being said I did notice that Mark was taking it a lot harder than Jane. I often hang out with Mark 1 on 1 especially since the break up (because we cant hang out as a group anymore) and he seems a complete mess. He would keep looking at her social media and bad mouthing her occasionally which I ask him to not do, at least around me. He's also much more irritable and demotivated since the breakup. When my wife and I spend time with Jane, it feels like she isn't even really bothered by the break up except for expressing one time that she wish she took my advice about them not dating.

2 months after their break up Jane revealed to us that she is seeing someone new (Tim) and she started posting him on her social media. My wife and I met him shortly after, and he seemed like a nice guy . He's young (31), was charming and apparently made quite a bit of money. I checked on Mark to make sure he was okay because I was sure he must have seen it on social media, and he was livid, started going off about how he was sure she cheated and there was no way she would have found this guy so soon after their break up. I confronted Jane about this and she showed me her chat log history, and it confirmed that she and Tim met a month after her break up with Mark, and then she dated him for a month before making it official.

I told this to Mark but he was not having it, he believed that she was cheating on him with this guy while they were together and that's why she pulled away from him. But the thing is, I did ask him when they broke if she cheated on him or if he suspected she was cheating and was insistent that she was not cheating and they were just incompatible.

Anyway, fast forward to now, Jane put something on her social media that indicated that Tim was going to be her plus one to our wedding. Mark called me distraught, and asked me to let her know that this guy is not welcome to our wedding. I told him that I cant just rescind the invite this close to the date and besides what reason was I to give her to justify barring her boyfriend from coming? I told him that if he had a girlfriend I wouldn't prevent him from bringing her. He said Im being a bad bro and putting a woman between us. He hung up and wont pick up my calls anymore.

72,1flbp73,AITA For Not Picking Up And Moving Immediately? ,"I (27F), have a toxic family. I know this. And admittedly, I have played into the cycle in the sense that all I ever wanted to do was make my mother (55F) proud of me. At all costs.

Since I was 18, I was forfeiting portions of my paychecks to my mom to cover the expenses lost from child support since I aged out of it. As I got older, I’d continue to give her money for various reasons (a few that come to mind are how I dropped like 300 bucks during the pandemic to get a bidet so she wouldn’t have to fight for toilet paper). I was never mad about giving money. If anything, I liked being helpful. 

(No, my mom doesn’t work, can’t work due to an injury, and when we’ve asked about WFH jobs, she simply says she’s “too old to figure out how computers work now” and won’t do it). 

Flash forward to last year. I got a really good job where I was making great money (abt 2500 each payday) and I was able to save up well and support her. I was really happy. And then I unexpectedly lost the job earlier this year, which forced me to look for emergency work. The job I have now, I’m lucky to make 900 after taxes. And yet I still gave her up to half of my paychecks to make sure she had what she needed. 

My mom ended up leaving to go see my grandfather (85M) in another state, because he’s sick. She left in an RV with my aunt (58F) (which I paid for, gas, repairs, inspection, etc, on this meager paycheck) and has been gone for two months. I’ve told her I was planning to move out there with her, but between supplementing her and such, it would take me a long time to save up and get there. 

Last night she ripped into me about how I abandoned her out there, how I’m selfish and a failure of a daughter, a horrible person, I was totally okay with her being by herself, and how she failed raising me. I was on the phone for two hours, stuck in an emotionally / verbally abusive cycle of “hang up, I don’t wanna talk to you anymore” and “oh, so you’re just gonna hang up? You’re just gonna go? Am I wasting your time that much?” 

In the call, she told me that she was coming back to the state here to collect her belongings and move back to my grandpa permanently, and that I better not be here when she gets back. So fine. My heart broke and I’m packing my things to go move in with my fiancé (who I have not already lived with due to religious reasons, but desperate times call for desperate measures) in a few days.

73,1flbi1d,AITA for not changing our reservation to accommodate my sister’s new boyfriend? ,"We had a group date night for me, my wife’s best friend (her husband) and my sister and her new boyfriend Tyler.

It was for a sushi place that my wife and her friend picked. My wife had do put her credit card down for the reservation because it was a Saturday night and it was a larger party. 

On the way to the restaurant, my sister said in the group chat let’s meet here (another restaurant) instead ignoring our reservations. My wife told my sister she can’t because of the cancellation fee. My sister tried to say Tyler doesn’t eat fish so let’s go here and we can all chip in on the cancellation fee.

My Wife’s best friend said no. It’s rude the reservation are in less than 30 minute, so we are going to the sushi restaurant for dinner like planned.

Tyler and my sister show up late and Tyler announce it is because they had to stop somewhere for him to eat before they showed up.  Tyler was rude to us and the wait staff when they didn’t have any of the beers he wanted on tap. Although he already ate he tried some ginger bbq wings and hated them and complained to everyone about them.

We didn’t interact much with Tyler after that. Both my wife, her friend and her husband are all Latino so they speak in a Spanglish mixture. It’s not hard to follow. I’m white and so is my sister and Tyler.

Tyler gets grumpy when someone ‘mas’ at the table and asked them to speak in English. As if mas was something that is complicated to understand.
The whole dinner was a shit because of Tyler's attitude. 

Then, Tyler breaks up with my sister later that week saying she was spoiled and blaming her family to being rude to him. I told my sister it seemed like no loss because Tyler was a dick. My sister said my wife and I was the dickheads because we had to get sushi after she tried to get us to someplace else. I told my sister that we are not canceling reservations for one person 20 minutes before we have to check in. I told my sister Tyler was a rude, childish dickhead and I’m glad her broke up with her so I never have to see his fucking face again. 

My mom texted me later saying I need to apologize because my sister had been crying all day over the situation and break up.

74,1flbb93,AITA: Husband won’t stand up to his ex wife,"Update: she refuses to bring SS2 over and no way to get him here…. Then turns around and sends her father to get SS1 with zero communication between adults! I will not be picking up due to this bs that is a constant with her

Update I had to edit it. Im trying to break it down sorry.

Here is some back story. I have been with my husband for 4 years. I have always done my best to get alone with the ex-wife for the kids because I do most the exchanges not because I want to because my husband has made it my responsibility. Over the years we have allowed the ex to family events on my property (her family only) when her house was to small and disgusting, we offered to let her have her daughter birthday at my house because she didn’t have room for it where she lived. I have taken the boys to all the holidays to see their mother even if it was our time not hers cause she and my husband asked and if i said no it started a fight. (So I did Trying to keep the peace) We have had to lie to her and tell her that her son’s birthday was hours earlier (11am) then it originally start time(1pm). She still showed up at 230pm with nothing but excuses and thought it was funny she was late. Her only comment was I’m never on time who cares. Also worked around her schedule many times over the 4 years. She even moved out of state with out telling us and we continued pick ups or drop off.

Fast to yesterday I have asked my husband to asked ex if she could drop SS2 off today because I do not have time to after work. She has been picking up SS1 for the last 5 weeks with no communication that she is coming to get him she just shows up. I haven’t minded because father has been gone I’m not going to keep him from his mother. I told him if she wants him on weekends she can pick him up. A little communication to give me heads never happens) Come down to this weekend I asked hey will you see if she will drop off SS2 instead of picking up SS1. He blew up on me saying she won’t why bother asking yet he didn’t even attempt to ask. Which resulted in a fight with him. Then him telling me you deal with her then. I told him no it’s not my job! It was his I’m done being nice and getting treated like I’m invisible unless she wants me to do something to make her life easier. Then woke up to a text from my husband saying “I guess SS2 isn’t coming over this weekend thanks” all his mother has to do is drop him off I’ll take him home Sunday. 
 
I personally don’t understand what the issue is if she has been at my house every Friday to pick up SS1 why can she not come this Friday and drop off SS2. what is the difference and why is it a problem? And why I’m getting blamed when he won’t step up and say something or set any kind of boundaries with her. She does absolutely anything she wants to when when ever with no representation for the constant disrespect and entitlement just cause she is their mother. 

My daughter’s birthday dinner is tonight. I do not have time to go to 45 mins away each way to pick him up.

My husband won’t stand up to her. He acts like making her mad or asking her to do anything is a mortal sin!!!! Heaven forbid she is asked to do something. I have tried to set boundaries many times and failed due to me giving in cause nothing was changing. I need to know if I’m in the wrong

Mind you I have two kids of my own and have zero issues with communication and how we spit out time! So I know it’s possible and I ask the same out of him I do her and she continues to not care who she affects.

The grass is wild country grass and takes some time to cut, I couldn't cut it earlier on in the week as I was rather at work or it was too wet to cut. I finished cutting the grass, getting rid of piles of grass that was left from the day before that my mother cutted. Then I shoveled some grass, weeds and moss that was overgrown a ramp that I didn't get around to, but I did while I still had the energy before my break.

My mother comes and asks me if I can do the gardens footpath. It's 23 tiles long and has sliced roof tiles on the sides. The tiles aren't exactly light and she expected me to do it by myself, and I haven't even taken my break yet as I am drenched in sweat. I refuse, then she goes back inside before I put away all the tools and finished dumping the grass in a suitable location in the garden. 

So I finished up all of it and was sitting on the bench outside in the shade before I attempted to go inside. Turns out she locked the door and wouldn't let me in unless I do the footpath. I still refused, but at least she gave me a point of water so I can at least get back some energy. Eventually she opens up the door, I go in and she took my controller to my console.

After work the next day, she asks again after I had a busy day and expected the footpath to be done in 20 minutes. 20 minutes later and I only done 4 tiles. I argued to her that I knew I wouldn't get this done in 20 minutes and I do the work at my job fast, because I have a team that helps me compared to her. 

She still tried to explain that she could do it faster, so I handed over the spade and said ""Well, go on then superwoman.""

She dropped the attitude, gave back my controller and the footpath was finished the next day.

77,1flb0h0,AITA for given my friend the silent treatment after he tried to get me to fall in love with him?,"I (17f) started a new school last year and since then i’ve made friends with quite a few people, that including a group of boys, which is where my story begins. 

One boy we’ll call Jim(16m) became really close with me, simply because we shared the same interests and the same humour. Around this time, a joke was going around the group that me and another boy we’ll call Nate(17m) were in a relationship. This made me uncomfortable because i am asexual (i experienced little to no sexual attraction to others) and Jim noticed this and asked me about. I decided to tell him how i felt about it so he spoke to his friendship group and the jokes died down. 

Over the next couple of Jim and my friendship grew closer to the point where i thought i could consider him one of my best friends, but that all changed when the summer holidays rolled around. I wanted to dedicate the summer holidays to friends from my old school as i hadn’t seen them in months and wanted to spend as much time with them as possible before we’d have to go back to school again. 

But during that month, Jim would constantly ask me to go out with him alone. At first i didn’t mind as it was simple things like going on walks and going to mcdonald’s. but then it escalated to fancy restaurants and asking me to “spend the night”, so i started refusing.  

Upon arrival back at school this month, I overheard a conversation with his friends who were encouraging him to ask me out on more “dates” so i’d fall in love with him. When i confronted Jim about this he said that i was “coming on to him” so he thought i was giving him mixed signals (the most i’ve ever touched him was a high five). i felt so disgusted and have been avoiding ever since because if he thinks i’m giving him mixed signals, i’d rather not give him any signals at all.

81,1flao0f,AITA for refusing to make my brother a sandwich?,"



For the time being, me (22F) and brother (23M, “Khenan”) moved back in w our parents (49F) (52M) to avoid paying rent while we took an zoom coding class, which is time consuming. 8 hours a day, camera on at all times, leaves us no time to go to work.

We set up home 2 months before the class began, and I’ve noticed “Khenan” began prepping food and stuffing in the fridge/freezer in bags for days ahead of time. I understand a week ahead of time, but he makes it up to 2 days ahead of time.

I told him this was unfair, but he’d say he bought it with his own money, and he can’t waste time. But for reasons I can’t be bothered to get into, I’m low on money despite working longer than he ever has, I spend on games and hygiene and clothes. He plays more games than me. He and everyone else will deny it but if I have no money, I don’t believe he has much either. 

This Sunday, he was arguing with our mother. She said some the food he prepped and froze was spoiled, which he didn’t believe saying he bought it a few days ago, and planned on eating it during lunch breaks. She won out, threw it all away, but said it’s okay bc he’ll have something prepped for the next classes. A few hours later, she tells me to prepare food bags in zip locks for him.

1, he wouldn’t like it anyway. He counts calories and measures everything, even protein! And sauces! Oncee tried to insist on measuring something while I prepared it for him, because I was sick of him prepping, but I couldn’t let that happen, I just made it, and if he really wanted it he’d just sit the fuck down and fucking eat it. 

2, we had no meat/rice She waited until 6 PM to demand I drive out, buy chicken and rice, *cook rice*, and remake food for my brother after she threw away what he already hoarded for himself.

3 there’s already food and snacks in the house he can prepare or prep from. The day before, or the day of. Like a normal person. Frozen Burgers, frozen French fries, franks, chips, cookies, pretzels, buscuits. he used to love at least half of these things (Especially fries) but he now eats them rarely if at all since this diet nonsense took him over.

I did, ultimately, go to the store to buy what she wanted and other stuff, she decides to claim she gave me money to buy it, giving him the green light to cook and hoard a portion of it. 

He’s still very much pissed about what she did. But when I tried to tell him what he was doing was unfair he snapped back at me claiming he barely has time to study, walk, or workout if he doesn’t do this, and that I’ve been giving him too much shit over his body (Earlier this year, he weighed out to be 155lbs as a 5'8 man, which is admittedly tiny. He now weighs 140-something!) and asked me to not throw his stuff away

I admit he has a right to be angry about that last thing, but it just isn’t fair seeing food I do and don’t like taking up space like this, if I can’t take from it like everything else.

My friend was in a bad place and asked if he could move in with us when we found a place, I asked my wife if she was ok with it and she said that she was.

After we found a place and he moved in we set the ground rules that if he was staying with us that he need to help with rent. (Which was about 400 per person) and he did. After working for about 3 months he met his current girlfriend and a couple months after that asked if she could move in with us.

He quit his job about 2 months after she moved in after leaving me, his girlfriend and, my wife to pay the rent while he stayed at home playing video games. 

When it was time for the lease to be renewed we all sat down together and I asked if they were going to stay through the next lease term. They said they would and we left it at that, the next day I was at work and he texted me saying that when I got home he wanted to talk. 

When I got home he informed me that his girlfriend missed her family and wanted to go live with them again (they live just 10 minutes away) and she wanted him to go with her. I told him that we just had the conversation about renewing and that if they left it would be hard on us to pay the rent since we were planning our wedding. 

He said that he would help us if they moved out (which they didn’t) and when he moved out that was kind of the end of it all for a bit. Until about 2 months ago he calls me out the blue and asks me if I would co-sign on an apartment for him. I told him that I don’t know because I already have this apartment in my name and that if they don’t pay I wouldn’t have the money to pay for theirs.

I don’t know if I am the asshole for not helping him after he told me one thing and changed his mind the next day.

Side note: When it was time for my wedding I called him and asked if he was going to be there since he was one of the groomsmen and he said that he couldn’t unless I picked him up and dropped him off after. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-20,"AITA for refusing to co-sign for a apartment for my ex roommate  So about a year ago me(22) and my fiancée (now wife) (20) were looking for a place to get out of my mothers house. My friend was in a bad place and asked if he could move in with us when we found a place, I asked my wife if she was ok with it and she said that she was.

After we found a place and he moved in we set the ground rules that if he was staying with us that he need to help with rent. (Which was about 400 per person) and he did. After working for about 3 months he met his current girlfriend and a couple months after that asked if she could move in with us.

88,1fl84sn,AITA for not letting my stepbrother stay with me when he starts off at college?,"My girlfriend (24f) and I (25m) became home owners a year ago. My brother (18m) moved in with us after he finished high school in May so he can attend community college in our town. This was something we had planned with him months in advance and we were both on board with the idea. He's settled in well and has a job, started classes, made new friends and everything.

Now my dad and his wife are expecting me to let my stepbrother (17m) move in next year when he starts college. My dad was not informed of my brothers plan to love with me. My brother waited until May to tell him what was happening and my dad wasn't happy that I had been talking to my brother about college and where he'd live but not my stepbrother.

My dad and his wife married when I was 11 and my mom died when I was 9 so I lived with them. For that reason my dad feels like my stepbrother isn't just a stepsibling but a sibling and should be given the same chance. I disagree and I never thought of my stepbrother as my sibling. To me my brother was always my only sibling. We were close and I'd spend time with him when I could. Never did the same for my stepbrother and I don't keep in touch since moving out. It just wasn't the same to me. I'm not all that close to my dad either so really it's just my brother and now he lives with me.

Anyway, I said no to my stepbrother staying with me and told them they'd need to figure out something else. Dad accused me of playing favorites and tried to berate me for it. I told him I was happy to have my brother live with me but he's my only brother. I stopped taking their calls and ignore their texts but there have been many from dad and his wife saying I'm acting like a dick. My stepbrother also reached out and asked why I didn't want to let him live with me and he promised he'd work and help around the house like my brother.

My sister Sara (14f) has a best friend in school who I’ll call Tina (also 14f I think). Tina and her family live quite close to their school, and Tina goes for after-school classes nearby while Sara comes back directly using the school bus. We live quite far away from the school, around a 35 min bus ride. She isn’t allowed to leave the building otherwise.

Sara needed a textbook for one of her classes. The schools shop for uniforms and official notebooks is right next to where Tina’s classes are held. Neither Sara nor Tina have phones. Sara uses mine (17f) and Tina uses her older sister Kelly’s (17f) phone.

Now me and Kelly were classmates back when we were in their school (Its only up till 10th grade, 11th/12th are separate where we are). We weren’t friends, I am quite indifferent towards her but I know she didn’t like me (She thought I was racist for singing an MJ song for one of our school performances bc of the whole skin bleachig thing ??? idk). To clarify, none of us are white. We live in Asia.

Anyway Sara messaged Kelly if she could pass on the message to Tina abt buying the book for her. This is something Tina has done for Sara a couple of times and she has always paid her back the next day so she didn’t think there would be a problem. Kelly replied saying word for word “I didn’t know Tina was a personal assistant to you. She doesn’t owe you anything and does not need to buy anything for you” and went on to call her entitled and selfish. Sara came and told me about this and I got quite upset. I texted her back saying ”Hey Kelly, \[my name\] here. Idk if you know this but it’s called a ‘favour’. Something friends do for each other. Maybe you would know if you had friends. Don’t speak to my sister in like this manner again” and proceeded to block Kelly (remember this was using my phone)

I don’t regret what I said. Kelly was needlessly rude and condescending and honestly it wasn’t her place to disagree on behalf of Tina who I dont think knows about this yet.

92,1fl73sg,AITA for telling my boyfriend he smells,"I (22F) have been dating my boyfriend (22M) going on a bit over 2 years already. He has always been smelly but nothing I couldn’t handle from time to time. I would jokingly comment about this when I would go visit him at his old apartment.


We now moved into an apartment together far away from home and I noticed how he smells more often than before. I would have his arm around me and then hours later I’d smell my shirt where his arm was and it would stink bad. I have to tell him to put on deodorant, brush his teeth, and sometimes to even full on shower cause he will rarely shower two days in a row. But even then, he gets stinky immediately after getting out of the shower and starts sweating. I feel like it has to be a genetic thing that he can’t control cause I have never seen that before. And to maintain it he would have to really do a lot. Like use deodorant immediately after getting out of the shower, reapplying after 8 or so hours, and even brushing his teeth after every meal. Idk how he does it but after awhile even with deodorant he starts to smell and I feel bad cause he can’t control it, but now it’s hard for me to want to have sex anymore because of this. I can smell him while we are doing it sometimes and it just completely takes me out of it. But despite all that I love him so much and I can tell he really loves and appreciates me. He is a great boyfriend.



One random day I could smell him and in a joking way (like the couple-y borderline baby talk voice) said “you smell” while making a funny face and he got really upset. I had joked like this all the time with him before because how else do you tell someone they smell? He got upset and started saying that it makes him feel bad when I tell him he smells. That it’s mean and he doesn’t like it. And asked how I would feel if he told me that. I didn’t know how to respond without sounding like a bitch saying he was the one that smelled not me and that if anyone told me I stank I would try everything to fix it cause I don’t want to be that smelly person. But as we sat in silence he finally said that I could have said it in a nicer way, and then we started arguing about the tone I said it in.

99,1fl6175,AITAH for not attending my brother’s funeral?,"AITAH for not attending my brother’s funeral?

Hi Reddit, 


My F43 brother (M33 at the time of death January 2018) passed away on his birthday. 

He had been struggling with alcohol addiction which got only worse after the death of our mother a few months prior ( February 2017). 
He was un employed.

The death of my mother devastated me, I the first born and have been co - parenting my siblings to my single widowed mother. I live abroad and my whole family remained in our country. 

My Mother was a teacher and didn’t earn a lot of money. We were 6 siblings and of the six only 2 had careers and income despite all of us having higher education. I won’t get into specifics, it’s just to say that most of my family looked to me for financial assistance.

Am married , have a decent job but don't earn extravagantly. My husband has a white collar job and we own our home with a small mortgage. all this to say we don't have a lot of money in savings but mostly in assets. 

when my mother passed, I was confronted with funeral costs and travelling cost that cost me almost 20k € . All by myself ! My husband couldn’t even afford to come with me because of the cost. When my sis said we had to pay everything, this shocked me because most of my mother's siblings are well off. am talking ministers and members of parliament in my country.  

They said since i lived abroad I should be able to afford it. They are going through hard times too. 

In my culture we feed the mourners for the duration of the funeral. Arrange transportation etc. The whole thing cost so much and stressed me that I couldn’t even mourn my mother properly. 

I had to deal with people asking me for money to solve their problems while at it. Just traumatising.

After buying the burial plot and casket and payment of body preparation I was just broke. I flew back home to my husband and finally got to mourn my mother.

A few months later my brother goes drinking with his friends on his birthday, comes back home, goes to bed and never woke up. 

I got the call about the news and got my heart broken again. 

We looked at our financial situation and after the experience of my mother’s funeral, we came to the conclusion that :
1: I fly back there to attend the funeral but won’t be able to afford said funeral.
2: I send everything I saved ( almost 15k € to my sis so she can organise a decent funeral for my brother and afford feeding mourners. 

I couldn’t afford both. 

I chose to send the money despite how much I wanted to go so my brother could get a decent funeral and be laid to rest. 

I recently heard from a cousin that my relatives call me the AH and cruel/ heartless.for sending money and not attending funeral. 

We asked for help to cover funeral.They said they couldn’t afford to help us.

(Sorry for typos)

 I thought being pragmatic was the best decision , was I wrong?

103,1fl5pfb,AITA for not telling my (ex)wife that we lived in a rental apartment.,"Hi.

Back in 2008 when I started University, I rented a 2 bedroom apartment with my (exex)girlfriend at the time and my friend & his girlfriend.  
We got a great deal for it, as the owner of the place lost his job because of everything that happened back then and decided to try her luck abroad where she still lives.

Years went by and after University my friend and his GF decided to find a place of their own, as we had full-time jobs, renting this apartment together did not seem expensive anymore, and also did not seem expensive to rent alone after we broke up some time later.

So there I was, alone in a 2-bedroom apartment in the central part of the city.  
The owner decided that she was too lazy to mess with bills and stuff every month and made arrangements for me to pay everything directly, as I earned her trust, I still pay her monthly rent which is very cheap for today and deal with everything else having her authorization.

Because of the perfect location, my second bedroom was basically ""free BNB"" for my friends who did not live in the city and I did not mind, it is good to have company if you live alone.

In 2020 I met a girl who was in a rush to get married and as I was madly in love we did in 2021.  
For some reason, I never told her the story of how I rented the place or that it was a rental at all, it just never came up! I have been so used to the fact that I am an authorized representative with building cooperative things etc, that I refer to it as my place.  
  
Our relationship started to cool down and we found out that we were not perfect for each other after all, so divorce it is.

So we did the paperwork for divorce and she is moving out.  
A few days ago I received an email from her with a real estate valuation document as an attachment - while I was not at home she wasted 500€ for someone to evaluate an apartment that does not belong to us... and wrote that I probably have to take a loan to pay her the 50% of that.  
I replied to her, didn't I ever tell her that this place is a rental? Why does she even assume that I can afford a 2-bedroom apartment in the city centre? She knows where I work and how much I earn.

She called and screamed at me, that I had lied to her for years and hid the fact that the apartment was rental! Then she tells me that well, she will take the car as we got that together!  
And I was quiet for a moment and then told her: ""You do know that is a lease right? The owner of the car is the bank!""  
Then she demanded that I pay for the valuation and I replied ""I did not ask you to do it!""  
She called me an asshole and ended the call.

Of course, she told our whole friends group how I ""lied to her during the whole marriage"" and there was a discussion in a messenger group with friends that if is it a lie or not, whether was it an asshole thing to do, some agree with me and some with her.

A few days ago I received an email from her with a real estate valuation document as an attachment - while I was not at home she wasted 500€ for someone to evaluate an apartment that does not belong to us... and wrote that I probably have to take a loan to pay her the 50% of that.  
I replied to her, didn't I ever tell her that this place is a rental? Why does she even assume that I can afford a 2-bedroom apartment in the city centre? She knows where I work and how much I earn.

She called and screamed at me, that I had lied to her for years and hid the fact that the apartment was rental! Then she tells me that well, she will take the car as we got that together!  
And I was quiet for a moment and then told her: ""You do know that is a lease right? The owner of the car is the bank!""  
Then she demanded that I pay for the valuation and I replied ""I did not ask you to do it!""  
She called me an asshole and ended the call.

Of course, she told our whole friends group how I ""lied to her during the whole marriage"" and there was a discussion in a messenger group with friends that if is it a lie or not, whether was it an asshole thing to do, some agree with me and some with her.  
  
My best friend told me, that this is a perfect topic for a Reddit thread!  
Now I ask you Reddit, AITA?",0.0,0.06917511,0,1

105,1fl599f,AITA for asking my roommate to lower the temp,"I (21F) am a college student living with three roommates (all 22F). We have single rooms and two bathrooms in our apartment. Olivia's room is next to mine, and we share a bathroom, while Paula is on the other side of the apartment with our random roommate. 

Paula tends to sleep quite warmly, needing a heating pad even at 76 degrees, while I prefer cooler temperatures around 70-72 degrees. Additionally, Paula is very noise-sensitive; even the sound of a ticking clock can disturb her sleep, and she can't tolerate any light coming in from under the door. We've all been living in the dorm together for about 3 weeks and pay the same rent. I've been struggling to sleep at night due to the heat, even when I don't use a blanket. I borrowed Olivia's fan recently, but she asked for it back, knocking at my door at 2am after mentioning she found it hot too, despite being similar to Paula in how she handles temperature. Using the fan helped a bit, but it left my mouth and nose feeling dry and sore from the air and dust. I can't open the windows because of bugs (trust me I tried), and it's been really tough to get a good night's sleep with the heat. The weather is expected to get colder soon, and I plan to keep using the air conditioning until the temperature decreases more. Since the beginning of the semester, Paula has insisted that it stay off, and Olivia, being closer to Paula, tends to go along with her decision. 

I messaged Paula to ask if we could turn down the temperature a bit since I was having trouble sleeping. She mentioned that she feels too cold and finds the AC's low hum too noisy for her at night. She then suggested that I take away my plushies, claiming that's why I'm so warm at night. However, I sleep without a blanket or plushies and still have difficulty. 

I suggested we have a meeting later that day to talk. During our conversation, I mentioned that I tend to get very hot at night, and I offered to help her by providing more blankets or a larger heating mat from my house. She insisted that her current setup is sufficient and suggested I just get a fan, but I explained that I find fans uncomfortable and I don't own one. I refuse to spend $40-80 on a fan that I'd only use for a month and would have to transport back and forth to my house far away. This led to an argument where she called me selfish, saying I should accommodate the majority since she and Olivia are comfortable.

106,1fl5823,AITA for blowing up on my male best friend for hurting me? ,"I (25f) got into a sticky situation with my ex-male best friend (25m), (who we will call Tom) and am now feeling as though I owe him an apology.

For context, Tom had gotten exposed by his girlfriend (23F)at the time (we’ll call her Mariah) for cheating on her with multiple women. She had found videos and photos in his phone as well as text message threads of him flirting and seducing other women. During his relationship he and I never had a thing. In my eyes we were truly friends and I took a significant step back in our friendship because I knew his gf was the jealous type. Tom and I went to talking every day and hanging out often, to talking maybe once a week and seeing each other once a month or once every 2 months and it was always in a group setting never 1 on 1. 

During Mariah’s phone investigation. She came across a text thread with an ex-best friend of mine. (24F who we will call Zoe). For context Zoe and I were like 2 peas in a pod I confided in her with a lot of personal things and she did the same with me. One of the things I confided with her in was my feelings towards Tom. 

Tom and I had met 1 year prior to him meeting Mariah. In the beginning of our friendship Tom and I were “talking” and I had developed feelings for Tom and I would share how I felt about him with Zoe. Zoe would proceed to talk shit about him and tell me how he’s no good for me, he’s just a player and I should block him and pay him no mind (lowkey she was right). I later found out that Zoe was going behind my back talking shit about me and causing me to miss out on opportunities within our work place (we were coworkers and she would throw me under the bus to try and get promoted before me) She also had told another friend of mine that I was “hindering her growth” because I didn’t tell her about a manger position for another company that Tom had informed me about and encouraged me to go for. I then found out that after talking shit about Tom she was actually texting and flirting with him behind my back. I ended up cutting her off because she just was not a good friend to me. 

I’m the type of woman if another woman tells me she’s interested in the same guy as me. I back off. Had she come to me and told me she wanted to pursue something with him I would have stepped aside to let her explore that. 

Anyways, fast forward and now Mariah is in the picture and she is reading the text messages between the two of them and from my understanding Zoe would mention me often and express to Tom how guilty she would feel as the two of them were sleeping around behind Mariah’s back. This is also how Mariah finds out that Tom and I have history and have slept together, but it was before Mariah was around. Zoe was not aware of Mariah and I’m guessing she thought I still had feelings for Tom; I don’t. Tom had admitted to me that in order to get Zoe to sleep with him he would tell her that he and I were not that close even though I know his mom, his brother, his close friends, and even his gf. I’ve even spent birthdays and Holidays with him. This really hurt me because how I see it is that he downplayed our friendship for pussy. 

This causes Mariah to go through the messages between myself and Tom. And she comes across old texts around a time where Tom was confiding in me because Mariah had found out that he tried to sleep with another woman 3 days after her birthday and he was afraid she was going to leave him. In the texts I basically told Tom that she will take him back because for the entirety of their relationship Tom was cheating on her and she had every sign in the world that he was doing so. Girl’s names would pop up on his phone, he would go hours without talking to her, and he predominantly has female “friends”. I was right, she did take him back. 

Mariah tells him that he’s stupid and blind because it’s clear that I want to be with him. But in truth I don’t. I see him for who is, while he can be a good friend at times he has no loyalty and he moves in very selfish ways. She also mentioned that I’m not a girls girl because I didn’t mention that he and I had history before her. But I feel that wasn’t my place that was his responsibility. The most I could do was try and encourage him to do right by her 

When he had told me that-that’s what she thought. It felt like a slap in the face. And I lowkey felt insulted. She even tried to say that I was “praying on her downfall” even though I was his only friend who did not condone his cheating behavior. He even asked me if I have feelings for him still and if I want to be with him, to which I told him no and explained why.

 It was then that I felt that I had to cut him off and when I did so I basically let my emotions get the best of me and I accused him of never truly being a friend to me. I told him he doesn’t respect me, that he doesn’t care about me, he used me, and the only reason as to why he did nice things for me was because he felt obligated to and guilty for sleeping with my ex-best friend knowing she talked shit about me and him and tried to sabotage my job opportunities. I even told him how I felt like he put no effort into our friendship. Even though I know that not all of this is true while he’s terrible at relationships he’s not that bad of a friend. He’s helped me with car issues, he’s been a confidant, he’s helped me get out of a terrible job, he knows I have little family so he did his best to include me in holidays and celebrations I knew that if I ever needed him he would be right there because he’s proven it time and time again and even going as far as to defend me when his gf and her friends would try and make wild claims about me. He even gave me reassurance when I felt as though I was being a burden to him. 

When I said these things to him. I said them via text and I told him I did not want to speak to him. To which he abided by. (Whether it be out of spite or not) Now I feel as though I handled the situation poorly and I made claims about him as a friend that were just untrue and I owe him an apology.

107,1fl5535,AITA for calling my friend embarrassing for how she acted at my birthday party?,"AITA for calling my friend embarrassing for how she acted at my birthday party?

I (19F), and my now ex friend (19F) recently got into a friendship ending conflict that she says I handled poorly but I really don't believe I did. I will be calling my ex friend Laura and then my other friend (19F) that is involved in this situation Belle.

It was recently my birthday and Belle had taken it upon herself to host my birthday party at her apartment. Laura had said originally that she might not be able to go as she had work until 6pm but I and Belle spoke with her saying that was perfectly fine but if the party was still going past her shift, then she was more than welcome to arrive late. Belle later texts Laura and she told Belle that she was at work and would text later. At 6, Laura finally texts saying that a family member died and she never went to work but that she still wanted to come. Belle told her to not come if she didn't feel up to it but Laura \*wanted\* to come. In this conversation of getting Laura to Belle's apartment, Belle offered to pay for an Uber for Laura to get there but Laura got a ride to the apartment and all was well for the next about 4 hours.

Laura gets there and we keep having fun until I have to take my partner and another friend of mine home. I start cleaning as I hear Laura and Belle start a convo that goes a little something like this:

L: Hey I don't know if that offer is still on the table but would you rather just pay whatever is cheapest? I don't know how expensive an Uber is compared to gas money.  
B: Let me see the price of an Uber.. (shows price to Laura) Wait. Why am I paying?  
L: I just figured you'd prefer what is cheapest.  
B: No I get that but why am I paying for it?

And the conversation continued like this for another five minutes in a dead silent room. I found it embarrassing that Laura, who didn't even know half of the people there, spoke that way to Belle.

All the next day, I hear nothing from Laura. So I sent her a message explaining that I was embarrassed about how she acted. The main thing I told her was that she made me feel horrible for inviting her because she did that in front of strangers who were my close friends.

So I think we talked it out and I explained I was also upset because she never reached out to me about the situation. She called me later in the week to tell me that she was shocked and hurt that I said what I did which I admit is rude and probably wasn't the best way to phrase my message but I was so frustrated!! In that phone call I acknowledged the fact I was rude which doesn't excuse my wording but whatever. A few days later she texts me saying she feels we shouldn't be friends anymore and the way I treat her makes her feel like I only care about myself. I don't necessarily regret the end of the friendship. I just wonder if I was in the wrong for how I handled the whole thing as all my friends say it was okay.

I have had a week long holiday booked with my girlfriend for a few months now. We’re supposed to leave in 10 days. Since then I started a new job contracting, so I get paid a day rate. If I have days off, I don’t get paid.  

Money is quite tight for me right now since my previous jobs final pay cheque will be reduced, and I have 30 days until I receive my first paycheque from the new job. I essentially have to pay 2 lots of mortgage/bills/living costs from savings.  

Taking these 5 days off now means that I have to lose ~£1500 in take home pay, and £600 in pension contributions.

109,1fl538u,AITA for not offering my fiancé some of my salad? ,I’ve just got done with a 10 hour shift at a restaurant that I worked on my feet all day. I couldn’t wait to come home and relax and eat something at home. My fiancé and I live together and we were both sitting on the couch watching a movie while I enjoyed my salad. I finished my salad and set it on the coffee table when he visibly got upset and stormed to the other room. Turning to me before he leaves and says “I always offer you some of my food and you never think of me.” He had already ate dinner previously to this and I was watching TV and not in the moment. We do offer each other our snacks or other food when we have it but am I really the bad guy for not offering him my salad? We haven’t had many issues like this before but there seems to be a pattern of (in my opinion) immaturity in certain instances and communication methods. Am I wrong to think this?

110,1fl4s6l,AITA for not inviting my friend on our trip after she initially dropped out?,"I (F35) and my husband (M37) had been planning a trip to Greece which would include 2 of my girlfriends, Tammy (F39) and Fae (F35). Fae’s bf was also going to join us, so a total of 5 people on the trip. 
Last month Fae and her bf said they couldn’t come on the trip due to financial reasons. I called Tammy to let her know that it might just be the 3 of us going to Greece now. Tammy said she might not be able to go either because if we split everything 3 ways she wouldn’t be able to afford it anymore, plus tickets to Greece were looking expensive. It looked like the trip wasn’t going to happen anymore. 

My husband said if my friends bailed then he was going to invite his friend Colin (M38), his wife Brie (F37) and their 1 year old son. I said ok. They continued planning the Greece trip with this new group made up of myself, my husband, Colin, Brie and their baby. 

(Note:Colin and Tammy used to date and were together for almost 10 years before a messy breakup. Colin settled down with Brie and they got married and had a baby last year). 

After some research, Colin and my husband decided that Greece was not a good option anymore given the amount of travel we were trying to fit into a week long trip, and it was turning out to be more expensive than we thought. They said we could do Spain instead and I agreed because I didn’t really care where we went as long as it was a trip with friends. 

This afternoon I was texting Tammy who asked how the planning was going and I said we weren’t doing Greece anymore and had changed to Spain. Tammy lost it. She said if we had told her that we were going to Spain she would have come too, she was interested in a guy who had recently moved to Madrid, and she didn’t mind being around her ex Colin and Brie. She said I changed the location on purpose and then didn’t inform her, betraying her. I reminded her that Husband and Colin made the decision and I went along with it and had no way to know that she would suddenly be on board again. I also asked her if she really wanted to be around her ex boyfriend and she said she didn’t mind and that they were on good terms. 

I apologized and said if she wanted to come she could join but she was pissed and said I orchestrated this on purpose and she was ending our friendship. Her main reason was that I changed the location because of how pricey Greece was getting but I didn’t suggest changing the location when she was still considering going. 

I couldn’t get my pov across that I wasn’t involved in the planning and even if i thought to invite Tammy to Spain once the change was made, I wouldn’t because it didn’t seem appropriate to invite Colin’s ex on our vacation. Also Brie isn’t on good terms with Tammy, but she is civil with her. 

I hate that our friendship is over due to this. I am a sahm with three small children and going through some medical stuff that have me distracted so maybe I’m just being dense.

One day my friend J suggested that he animates these little skits or animatics to try and gain an audience.

While I was working they were constantly asking me questions just to confirm and make sure I agree and they were also asking questions that would’ve been helpful to address in the pre-meeting so that we could finish our assignment on time. For further information we were under a strict time limit and we were running out of time, and the other two group members were not finished with their part.

116,1fl41pd,AITA for kicking up a fuss about my meth addicted brother? ,"I (22M) just moved out of my family home where I lived with my mother, brother (26M) and his partner. I have been paying rent and living at home while studying. At the start of this year, we found out that my brother and his partner had relapsed and picked up their previous meth addiction. It was never confirmed and we all lived under the same roof as we witnessed previous habits manifested between them (aggressive towards myself and my mother, sleeping all day and going out at night, losing their jobs, borrowing money, etc). This was then followed by our house being raided due to stolen goods. 

Just recently (\~5 weeks), my brother admitted to my mother that he was back on meth. It wasn't long after that I was sitting in the lounge room and I overheard my brother and mother casually talking about my brother being on drugs as if it was of no concern. This spiralled me out of control, as I was already on the brink due to telling my brother when I first heard the rumour that if he was back on it I would disown him.  

  
A week after that incident, I gave my mother the ultimatum that if he didn't go I will. I will just mention here, that my brother and his partner have not been paying rent. They have been borrowing money from her, eating her food, living under her roof and all that. My mother reluctantly agreed and told me that by the end of that day, it would be sorted. 

I came home that afternoon and was not surprised as my brother and his partner were at home with my mother in tears. I started an argument with my brother, I told him some pieces of my mind, which looking back was out of the blue and rather pent up. Essentially, in February we lost our grandmother (my mother's mother). My brother was late to counselling our mother because he was too busy doing who knows what. After that, my family went on a trip to another state where my brother and his partner argued the entire time (knowing my mother was upset about our grandmother). During this trip, thousands of dollars were borrowed from my mother which I know she will not get back. (Just want to clarify that I was not on this trip as I had to stay home to work). 

So, getting back to it. After I told him my mind I packed up my stuff and I left the house to stay with a friend. I haven't been back since and I've told my mother I want nothing to do with my brother ever again (going strong too). The reason I feel like an asshole is because I am starting to resent my mother for how this has unfolded. I understand that this would not be an easy situation for her, but now that the dust has blown over it very much feels like she would rather me leave than the son who is taking advantage of her. 

Overall, I just feel like I've thrown a spanner into the works of an already faulty machine and made the situation far worse. AITA for sticking my ground and setting boundaries?

I came home that afternoon and was not surprised as my brother and his partner were at home with my mother in tears. I started an argument with my brother, I told him some pieces of my mind, which looking back was out of the blue and rather pent up. Essentially, in February we lost our grandmother (my mother's mother). My brother was late to counselling our mother because he was too busy doing who knows what. After that, my family went on a trip to another state where my brother and his partner argued the entire time (knowing my mother was upset about our grandmother). During this trip, thousands of dollars were borrowed from my mother which I know she will not get back. (Just want to clarify that I was not on this trip as I had to stay home to work). 

So, getting back to it. After I told him my mind I packed up my stuff and I left the house to stay with a friend. I haven't been back since and I've told my mother I want nothing to do with my brother ever again (going strong too). The reason I feel like an asshole is because I am starting to resent my mother for how this has unfolded. I understand that this would not be an easy situation for her, but now that the dust has blown over it very much feels like she would rather me leave than the son who is taking advantage of her. 

Overall, I just feel like I've thrown a spanner into the works of an already faulty machine and made the situation far worse. AITA for sticking my ground and setting boundaries?

117,1fl40r3,AITA for leaving a woman alone at night?,"I'm a uber driver, and I'm 22F.

I picked up a girl at the club that was clearly very out of it. She was drunk, but drunk in the creepy way when most people I drive are drunk in the fun way.

She got in my car. I asked how she was. She seemed stone cold sober, but it took her ages to answer and she just stared at my head. It gave me the creeps, not gonna lie.

She eventually mumbled something incoherent that made no sense. A few minutes after this my ride was canceled. It's usually canceled by the person who put in the order but she wasn't on her phone and was just staring at me.

I told her the ride was canceled. She said nothing. I pulled over and said the ride was canceled again. I eventually said I can't give her a ride and have no idea where to take her. She finally said her friend made the ride for her and must have canceled it to go home herself.

It was the first coherent thing she said. I said you need to leave my car, I don't know where to take you. And she needs to order a new Uber on her phone. 

I had to say it a few times before she understood. She asked if I would take her home anyway, she had no money, though. I said no, and got mad. She said like, ""How dare you??? You're gonna leave me in the middle of no where at the middle of the night. You are truly satan for that.""

Honestly, the way she was talking and bringing up bible verses was freaking me out. If she was normal, I'd give her a ride home and lose money. But she kept staring at me and the way she was talking was creepy.

I asked her to get out of my car again and she refused. I said she needed to or that I was calling the police. She got out but she was cursing me out and calling me all kinds of names. I just got out of there.

AITA? I've asked my friends and some said it was fair, and some said I should have probably taken her and it was wrong to leave a woman out there alone.

118,1fl3ryl,AITA for Blocking My Dad Again?,"I (28F) had an amazing relationship with my dad (60M) growing up. However, over the years, his relationship with my mom (49F) deteriorated. He became psychologically abusive toward both her and my sister (18F). I stepped in to support my mom, but it soon became a never-ending cycle of drama, as my mom was codependent on my dad. After a lot of pushing on my end, they finally divorced.

This whole process changed my view of my dad completely. I’ve lost all respect for him. Not only has he refused to support my mom and sister financially for years, but he's also often the source of many of the problems they face. I reached a breaking point and decided to distance myself from him.

I live abroad, so our primary means of communication is through WhatsApp. Back in January, I blocked him on WhatsApp (I don’t even remember the specific reason). But I do remember the sense of peace and calm I felt afterward, which I hadn’t experienced in a long time. He didn’t realize I had blocked him until months later. Instead of talking to me directly, he complained to my sister, trying to make her feel bad for my decision. I saw through this and eventually unblocked him, just to wish him a happy birthday. I left him unblocked for a few days afterward.

During this time, he started sending me polarizing, often fake, political posts that made me feel extremely anxious. I asked him to stop, not just because I disagreed with the content, but because I simply didn’t want that type of negativity in my life. I normally avoid that kind of content, especially in personal conversations. 

His response? He said he supported those views and didn’t care what anyone else thought. I told him I would block him again if he continued to send me such posts, to which he replied, “So be it.” So, I blocked him again.

Now, I’m wondering: AITA for blocking him? On one hand, I feel the same peace and calm I did before. On the other hand, I worry he may feel abandoned by me. But honestly, I don’t have the energy or mental capacity to deal with his chaos, gaslighting, and constant drama anymore. It also saddens me that he prioritizes sending fake political posts over maintaining an open communication channel with his daughter.

119,1fl3lrg,AITA for abandoning my cat,"so i used to live with my boyfriend in our shared apartment, and we adopted my cat. eventually our relationship kinda falls apart eventually leading up to our break up and we decided to move apart.
i wasn't prepared to start all over by myself. my family said i could stay with them while i look for a better paying job that will allow me to support myself all on my own. 


anyways after about a week of staying with my family and suddenly my step father dropped the bomb on me: the cat must be gone by the end of the week. i was so confused at the switch up because originally my family said they did not mind me bringing my feline friend.


i didn't want to send her to a shelter and have her wondering why i left her. i pleaded with my family and expressed the value she is to me, he didn't care, he said get her out by the end of the week. 
i tried asking trusted friends first, someone to watch her temporarily until i'm able to move out and get her back. no body was able to. i tried asking family members. 


i asked him to please give me a ride to a no kill shelter, if he wants her gone i figured he could help me do it properly, right? he refused. he told me if i had rides to work then i could find a ride to the shelter. i found that to be extremely petty but there was a point. 
i got one of my friends to give me a ride to the shelter. 
i broke down all the way there in the car. when we arrived to the shelter, although they were still open they weren't accepting surrendered pets past 3pm. 
i brought her back to the house and explained what had happened. he did not care. he said this is my responsibility and my failure to get rid of my kitty is not his problem. 


that night, my dad took the cat and dropped her outside in our neighborhood and just left her out there. no food no water, he even took her collar off. she is chipped that's the only good thing. when i found out what he had done the next morning i was in hysterics. 

he abandoned my baby outside with no way to fend for herself. she's always been a pampered indoor cat. he told me that my lack of responsibility has now caused the detriment of others.


he says how i failed her. or how he bets she's probably dead by now.  if they didn't want me to bring her to their home, they should've told me before i came to stay!


and then to spring it on me randomly, refusing to help although being aware of my situation. in my eyes i see this as cruel. against my cat most of all but also me. i didn't want to give her up but i eventually opened up to the idea of giving her to a family if they proved to be good enough. i feel so guilty. she is chipped but i havnt gotten a call about her since she was abandoned in late june.. they left my poor baby outside in the TEXAS HEAT.

120,1fl3g3o,AITA for being okay crating my dog for over 5 hours,"My (F27) husband (M27) and I are in the process of moving. I have a job teaching in home music lessons across 40 miles essentially (so I drive A LOT and have to deal with logistics all the time).
My husband got his law degree almost 2 years ago. His mental health has been a struggle and he hates law, so he was applying to jobs outside of law. He hasn't been able to find anything besides occasional contract work, so we've needed to live off my income for a long time. We can't afford rent in the area anymore, so we're moving to rent a house near and owned by his parents. He's applying to take the bar and starting to study now. I'm going back to work at a preschool and trying to open my own music studio.
This is relevant because I'm worn thin. I'm constantly dealing with logistics and my mental load is full. Not to mention the financial stress of currently supporting 2 adults and a dog on a low income. I'm trying to start my own business while prepping for a new job and trying to close up my other job. Not to mention the emotional labor of saying goodbye to children I've taught for years.

That brings us to today. One of my best friends from college was an actress in college but pivoted to a different career path. She was in a play this evening and hasn't performed in almost 5 years.
Also, we're moving in 2 days and I wanted to see them. In addition, all of my college friends visited from all over the country to go see it. I told my husband about this awhile ago but a lot has happened since then (like making our decision to move), so it slipped both of our minds until last week. By that point, he had told his boss (he works extremely part time at a concert venue) that he could work tonight. I had to leave straight from teaching as well to go to the play. I start teaching early afternoon and my husband would have to leave at 5pm and I was thinking I'd be home by 10:30

Our dog would have had to be in the crate for 5-6 hours with both of our schedules, BUT my husband got out early from work. I called him on the way home at 10 (I stayed a bit knowing he was already home) and we got in a huge fight about leaving the dog.
He says I chose a play over her and that I should have left early to be sure I was home within 5 hours. I told him that 30 minutes extra wouldn't be a big deal especially for something that's important and he said importance doesn’t matter. I certainly don't like leaving her for that long, but I don't think it's the end of the world if something comes up that matters. We got into a yelling match on the phone and he completely ignored me when I came home.

I think I might be the asshole because I should have planned better and our dog is already extremely stressed with our apartment full of boxes so maybe this time wasn't the time to be lenient.

He has scolded me a few times for killing the roaches with Raid, and he confiscates the Raid can sometimes to stop me from doing so. 

But when he sees too many roaches before I notice them, he blames me and says that I don't clean the house well enough and that's why they're here, but I try my best to clean up any used paper/tissues and food crumbs, I also do my best to wash the dishes every night even though I might forget once a week or so. I know I overreact because I hate them, but he under reacts and doesn't want to do anything about it.

I've started to snap lately and lose my patience, even to the point of saying that idc about what he thinks of our relationship anymore because it's been made clear that he only cares when an attractive girl makes her opinions/advice clear. Whether it's family or a random lady in the area. I've straight up said to him that I didn't care if he dated someone behind my back because I'm hoping that another person would help convince him to care more about these kind of issues.

I've had multiple meltdowns because I have a huge phobia of cockroaches and he keeps getting mad at me and saying I'm overreacting when I see more than 2 or 3 of them in the house. Btw, these roaches are NOT small. They are 5-7 inches in size and we're somewhere in California. These things are huge with wings, and he doesn't want anything to be done about it.

I kept stepping on them or whacking them down with my shoe at first, but that didn't work so I began spraying them down with Raid. I leave the window open every time just in case it might affect our health. He has scolded me a few times for killing the roaches with Raid, and he confiscates the Raid can sometimes to stop me from doing so. 

But when he sees too many roaches before I notice them, he blames me and says that I don't clean the house well enough and that's why they're here, but I try my best to clean up any used paper/tissues and food crumbs, I also do my best to wash the dishes every night even though I might forget once a week or so. I know I overreact because I hate them, but he under reacts and doesn't want to do anything about it.

I've started to snap lately and lose my patience, even to the point of saying that idc about what he thinks of our relationship anymore because it's been made clear that he only cares when an attractive girl makes her opinions/advice clear. Whether it's family or a random lady in the area. I've straight up said to him that I didn't care if he dated someone behind my back because I'm hoping that another person would help convince him to care more about these kind of issues.

I've had multiple meltdowns because I have a huge phobia of cockroaches and he keeps getting mad at me and saying I'm overreacting when I see more than 2 or 3 of them in the house. Btw, these roaches are NOT small. They are 5-7 inches in size and we're somewhere in California. These things are huge with wings, and he doesn't want anything to be done about it. And I'm too hotheaded or terrified to handle seeing them.

124,1fl2krg,AITA for not sharing my Good & Plenty?,"I (24m) love the candy “Good & Plenty”. If you’re wondering what they are, you have definitely seen them but maybe have never tried them. They’re the black licorice candies that come in pink and white candy coatings. I have always loved Good & Plenty, ever since I was a kid. It is safe to say that most people do not like them because they are black licorice. I love black licorice, so I eat them all the time.
The problem lies in the fact that other people think that they are “gross”. For years, I have eaten them at public places and events such as sports games, the movie theatre, and school/work. It never fails that someone (usually a friend/coworker/ will recognize the candy, saying “I’ve always wanted to try one of those, may I?”. I have always shared when they ask because I like sharing experiences that I love to the people around me. But then, every single time, they say it’s the grossest thing they’ve ever eaten and that I am gross for liking them. It makes me mad when people shut down something that I enjoy. It’s not my fault that my taste is more sophisticated than yours. This has happened so many times that recently I have started saying “no” when someone asks to try one. Usually, this doesn’t create an issue, but it has with my new girlfriend that I have been with for a little over two weeks. Three days ago, we went to the movies. I, of course, snuck in a box of Good & Plenty. She asked to try one and I said “No, you wouldn’t like it”. She insisted that I gave her one and that even if she didn’t like it would be OK. I didn’t feel like arguing in the middle of the movie, so I just didn’t respond to her for the rest of the time at the theatre. When the movie was over, she walked out without me and I haven’t seen her since. She won’t respond to any of my texts or calls. It’s been a few days since then, so I understand that our relationship is probably over. I am OK with that, I just want to know if I overreacted.

The story leading up to this event starts when I get back from being out of state for 4 days, this is our first time apart, to go to the range because in this branch I have to yearly and our range on base was already scheduled up with people so we went to the next base over. To give context, I got back yesterday from driving a 4h trip and am exhausted because range includes waking up at 0300 to be at the Armory at 0400 for weapons draw then shooting for score for the next 12 hours in the sun and that was for all 4 days and the barracks they place us in had nothing no blankets, pillows, sheets, they weren't even clean as in they're yellow and have blood stains on the face down side, so we got little sleep. This is my first full day back home and I went to work like usual and get back home and we hangout for the next 4-5 hours watching TV, playing around, and playing with the dogs when it becomes 7 she starts getting ready to go to the gym when for the 20th time she says,""I wish you would come with me to the gym"" in which I reply,"" Baby, I'm exhausted and don't want to because I just got home and am finally able to relax"" when she finally gets to the door she says that we never spend enough time together because she knows by the time she gets back I'll be on my desktop playing my game. I'm tired of this argument because I have slated out time for me to play my game before I go to bed around 8-10 or 12 depending on if I workout in the morning or have to wake up early for some other reason plus it's the only time I get to hangout with my friends I'm no longer near. I use to go to the gym with her and sit around watch my phone for an hour till she was finished but now that she has friends to go with now and the gym is open to the public I know that I can't just sit around awkwardly doing nothing while they workout so I stopped going.

Now I'm feeling bad about not going because I missed her while I was gone and I hate our disagreements because she is going to hold it against me in the future when this happens again and I won't remember it because I have a horrible memory.

When I fully moved out, I cut contact. About a month or so after, she found out that she has stage 3 breast cancer. I naturally told Hank. Me and Hank talked about literally everything. We spent the entire 3 1/2 years gaming, talking everyday, etc. I posted some depressive things on ig that caused a bit of worry. We facetimed where I expressed that I didn't have support and that I felt alone. Hank says "" please call or text me whenever. I'll answer"". Hank has a new gf Hannah(23F).

Unbeknownst to me at the time, Hannah was listening to our conversation. Hannah must have asked how we knew each other. Hank told her that we have ""history"", that I wanted a relationship with him and he rejected me. Mostly true. Hannah says that I make her uncomfortable and that she doesn't want Hank to talk to me. I am not desperate. Why would I want to be with someone who clearly doesn't want me??

I was texting him and was getting flat out ignored. Radio silence. I was not texting or calling for anything , except when I needed support. Hank has his read receipts on so I can see when he read my message. I would confront him about this. It was always ""oh I'm busy"" ""I was going to respond later"" ""I'm with my girlfriend"". Great.

Everytime I bought it to Hanks attention that he was being a poor excuse of a friend during a time of legitimate need, it was the same excuse of ""I'm in a relationship now of course things are different"".

Hank admitted to me that he knew he was being a bad friend, as he was actively ignoring some of his friends from college and other close friends. He also said how he cut off all of his female friends because she was uncomfortable with him having female friends.

Hank and Hannah broke up for a day after she claimed he left her stranded in their hotel room while on a trip to drop her son off to his dad for the remainder of the summer. Hank asked how she wanted the trip to be funded Hannah stopped talking to him. Hank has expressed that he doesn't like the way she treats her son. There are other instances of her just not being emotionally mature enough to be in this caliber of a relationship.

Throughout all of this I tried to remain impartial as being in a new relationship is great, but that does not mean being a terrible friend in order to be a good boyfriend.

My wife is the only one that talks to all three siblings.



This past July she was having surgery. As her husband, it has become my responsibility to keep everybody informed on her progress. When I received a message saying she was being taken into the OR, I used my wife's phone and sent out a group text to the entire family about what was going on.  I then put her phone in my bag and headed to lunch.  I was finishing lunch when the doctor called to say that she was out of surgery and everything went fine.   



I fish her phone out of my bag and find 20-30 replies to the original message. I skimmed the messages and they were all fighting about who got what from their parents' estate.



Then MY phone started blowing up and it was the younger sister calling me an asshole and saying that what I did was a dick move. Because now the older sister had her number, as well as the numbers of her husband and two kids.  



I replied that I simply fulfilled my obligation to keep everyone informed in the most efficient way possible. She didn't see it that way.  So I decided I value my sanity more than being right.

131,1fl0daf,AITA for letting my schizophrenic sister leave to live in her car?,"I (22f) let my older sister (28f) move in with me with the hopes that she'll be able to get back on her feet. A few years ago she had a mental break after moving out for the first time and was diagnosed with schizo affect disorder. Since then she has been living with my parents who have been stressed out taking care of her. During the time she's been with my parents she has ran away from home several times. All times luckily my mom was able to track her. When she is medicated, she still doesn't take care of herself i.e. showering, cleaning up after herself etc.

I know that part of the reason is because my dad isn't the best person to live with. He is very emotionally abusive so living there isn't good for a mentally stable person to live let alone someone dealing with a mental illness. I'm finishing up Uni these next two years and she also has a few years until she finishes (she's been out of school for 3 years) so I decided to let her come live with me to give her a fighting chance at getting her life back on track. I got a pill organizer for her as a way to give her her own agency but to also keep my peace of mind of her taking her medication.

Everything was going well for a week until I noticed she wasnt taking her medication. I would get back from work or school and saw she hadnt taken her medication so I started to remind her to take it. 
Now I'm having to constantly remind her and she's starting to get upset when I do. Today she got upset because I asked her to keep her medication in a place I had access to. She told me that she doesn't need to be taken care of and to leave her alone and that I'm acting just like our dad. I've only asked three things of her, to use the pill organizer, to keep it in a place I have access to and to clean up after herself ( this was week's after picking up after her because she doesn't clean up after herself). She started yelling about me being her younger sister and that I need to leave her alone. I told her I'm really not asking much from her and told her that she needs to take her medication because if not things can go really bad and I don't want things to go there.

She got really upset and said I'm impeding on her personal information and that I don't need access to her meds. Then said I'm talking behind her back with my mom about her having a mental illness (I'm not, I talk to her sometimes because she's been the one caring for her so she knows more).

She yelled at me and told me I need to leave her alone. AITA for letting her leave?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-20,"AITA for letting my schizophrenic sister leave to live in her car? I (22f) let my older sister (28f) move in with me with the hopes that she'll be able to get back on her feet. A few years ago she had a mental break after moving out for the first time and was diagnosed with schizo affect disorder. Since then she has been living with my parents who have been stressed out taking care of her. During the time she's been with my parents she has ran away from home several times. All times luckily my mom was able to track her. When she is medicated, she still doesn't take care of herself i.e. showering, cleaning up after herself etc.

I know that part of the reason is because my dad isn't the best person to live with. He is very emotionally abusive so living there isn't good for a mentally stable person to live let alone someone dealing with a mental illness. I'm finishing up Uni these next two years and she also has a few years until she finishes (she's been out of school for 3 years) so I decided to let her come live with me to give her a fighting chance at getting her life back on track. I got a pill organizer for her as a way to give her her own agency but to also keep my peace of mind of her taking her medication.

Everything was going well for a week until I noticed she wasnt taking her medication. I would get back from work or school and saw she hadnt taken her medication so I started to remind her to take it. 
Now I'm having to constantly remind her and she's starting to get upset when I do. Today she got upset because I asked her to keep her medication in a place I had access to. She told me that she doesn't need to be taken care of and to leave her alone and that I'm acting just like our dad. I've only asked three things of her, to use the pill organizer, to keep it in a place I have access to and to clean up after herself ( this was week's after picking up after her because she doesn't clean up after herself).

132,1fl0atl,AITA for wanting to spend more time with my mom?,"Growing up, my mom and I were really close, best friends. We had great communication. We shared a lot with each other and I always felt like I could confide in my mom and rely on her. 

In 2019, my dad passes away tragically. 30 years of marriage and my mother is a widow at 48. 

The first year after dad’s death was difficult. I tried my hardest to be there for my mom. I would make time for her, make sure we did family dinners (mom used to cook everyday and now she cooks a family dinner maybe once a year) so I do our thanksgiving, our Christmas, Easter, etc. as tradition is important to me and a way to commemorate my dad. For Valentines Day I took her with my friends and boyfriend to go axe throwing. I gave her flowers on her anniversary and cards. I always try to make her feel special and really tried to help mom during our time of grievance.

5 years later (2024) mom is 53 and I’m 28. She is “dating” a man who is 35. I met him for the first time at my mom’s house. He was pressure washing and removing tiles for my mom. I thanked him for helping my mom. Unbeknownst to me at the time that this was just her “friend” that she’s been basically living with for the past 4 years. 

She never told me she was seeing him. She never talked about him. She let it slip while I was going through a severely emotional and difficult time where I was experiencing panic attacks and strong bouts of anxiety I’d never dealt with until after my dad’s passing. She would lie about where she was. My mom, who was so close to family, started becoming more and more distant.

Due to a breakup I am living with my mom at home again and this month she has not slept at home once. I see her in passing when she goes back to “J’s” house. She has told me that she’s busy and if I want to spend time with her, to make an appointment. She doesn’t make an effort to do anything with me. She doesn’t prioritize any family obligations. 

In her words, she is “living her best life” and has “no responsibilities” and I’m “28 so I don’t need her anymore”.

In my entire time of knowing my mom I have never been too much or “too needy”. Since he has entered her life, I’ve been called both. it’s as though the life before her doesn’t exist. She tells me she can’t be the person she was. I don’t expect her to be. 

In so many ways, I have grieved two parents because the person my mom was and is today is so different than what I grew up with.

I have communicated to her my needs, to be told that I’m an adult and that I don’t need her. I have taken us to a third party counsellor to try to resolve this conflict, but every time I communicate with her she’s defensive.

I feel like I’ve already lost one parent and would like to have remained close to my mother.

133,1fl08km,WIBTA for pursuing getting my money back? ,"I, 19F recently stopped being friends with my (ex) best friend of 15 years. For the same of the story, we will call this girl Lisa. Sometime before we stopped talking, I gave Lisa around $60 for concert tickets, I am not the biggest fan of the artist we were supposed to go see but, agreed to go so that Lisa didn’t miss out on an opportunity to see them. 

Since then Lisa and I have stopped being friends, I don’t want to share too many detaols as it’s still pretty fresh. But, to summarise why we are ni longer friends, I felt like Lisa was not being a great friend to me and that we were both just becoming different people & growing apart. So, a few weeks after we stopped being friends, I messaged her and politely asked for my money back, and I got no response. I asked again a few days later, and this time I was blocked. So, with no money and no other way to contact her, I asked my elder sister for help. My elder sister suggested that I go round her house and try to talk about it with Lisa like an adult. I took my elder sister with me as backup, and to cut a long story short I discovered that a close family member died. It seemed to be a very recent death and had definitely taken a toll on the family, I was told by a family member that Lisa was to pay for a few of the expenses. Which meant she had no money. And that giving me the $60 was not a priority in her life at this moment. I understood and expressed that I was sorry to hear about the death of said family member. 

I didn’t stick around long after that, as I could tell the family were getting agitated. It’s been a few days since this has happened and I’m beginning to wonder if getting my money back is even worth it? I would ask for just the tickets, but I doubt Lisa would even respond since I’m blocked and has obviously bigger problems than a concert.

139,1fkyzl6,AITAH for not helping more with my live in father in law?,"A little background- my husband and I have been married 20+ years. We have two kids, the oldest is 19 and the youngest is 12. I work full time and my husband has not had a steady job during our entire marriage. 

I was always the primary caregiver to our children. My husband would occasionally help around the house, make meals and take the kids to appointments but all other child care was on my shoulders. This led me to become depressed and stressed most of our marriage. I only recently snapped out of it and decided to”it is what it is”. 

Now to my father in law- he had a stroke last year and ended up moving in with us. My husband is now his primary caregiver (he doesn’t work) I can tell he is stressed from being “on call” 24-7 with his father’s needs. I do what I can, but I also work full time. Initially, I would jump in and help every time father in law needed something. Now, I help but if I am in the middle of doing something I finish what I’m doing and let my husband handle it. The reasoning behind my change is because I realized that’s what he did while our kids were little. He wouldn’t jump up and help EVER. If he was doing something he wasn’t going to stop (unless I got upset/angry).

So am I the asshole for not helping more even though I know my husband is stressed?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-20,"AITAH for not helping more with my live in father in law? A little background- my husband and I have been married 20+ years. We have two kids, the oldest is 19 and the youngest is 12. I work full time and my husband has not had a steady job during our entire marriage. 

I was always the primary caregiver to our children. My husband would occasionally help around the house, make meals and take the kids to appointments but all other child care was on my shoulders. This led me to become depressed and stressed most of our marriage. I only recently snapped out of it and decided to”it is what it is”. 

Now to my father in law- he had a stroke last year and ended up moving in with us. My husband is now his primary caregiver (he doesn’t work) I can tell he is stressed from being “on call” 24-7 with his father’s needs. I do what I can, but I also work full time. Initially, I would jump in and help every time father in law needed something. Now, I help but if I am in the middle of doing something I finish what I’m doing and let my husband handle it. The reasoning behind my change is because I realized that’s what he did while our kids were little. He wouldn’t jump up and help EVER. If he was doing something he wasn’t going to stop (unless I got upset/angry).
