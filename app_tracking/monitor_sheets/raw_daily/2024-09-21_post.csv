0,1fluy89,AITA for complaining to HR that my colleague is using hate symbols ,"Throwaway for privacy.

Contex: My (27f) sister is a trans woman, and I'm very sensitive to discrimination, dog whistling and hate speech, including memes and emojis used to harass and ridicule vulnerable people. My colleagues at work know about my sister, as she picked me up at the office a couple of times.

A couple of weeks ago a colleague (25-30m) at work uploaded a bunch of custom emojis, like ""Chad"" or ""Pepe the Frog"" and started using it on slack, on shared all company channels. I did not assume bad intent, but as these memes are often used in hate speech and trolling, it rubbed me the wrong way. I messaged him privately, and politely asked him to stop using these emojis, I provided some links to why these are sensitive and best to be avoided in workplace settings. His reply was literally ""Lol mate"". At this point I got a sneaky suspicion that he isn't using these emojis innocently, so I took screenshots of where he used them, and of my messages to him, and forwarded to HR. HR agreed that it's best to err on the side of caution, and said to leave it with them. We are an absolutely no hate speech and no discrimination company, and it's written into our Code of Conduct which all employees have to sign. I don't know what exactly did HR do, but now I heard from another colleague that I'm an asshole for getting a guy in trouble at work over ""some stupid emoji"".

AITA?

EDIT: I should've elaborated that it wasn't just one Pepe The Frog, but a whole collection of emojis (Chad, Wojak, NPC with several variations on these) that may be innocent on their own, but uploaded as a bundle and then used a lot and out of context raised a red flag with me.
