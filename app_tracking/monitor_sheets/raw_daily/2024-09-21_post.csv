0,1fluy89,AITA for complaining to HR that my colleague is using hate symbols ,"Throwaway for privacy.

Contex: My (27f) sister is a trans woman, and I'm very sensitive to discrimination, dog whistling and hate speech, including memes and emojis used to harass and ridicule vulnerable people. My colleagues at work know about my sister, as she picked me up at the office a couple of times.

A couple of weeks ago a colleague (25-30m) at work uploaded a bunch of custom emojis, like ""Chad"" or ""Pepe the Frog"" and started using it on slack, on shared all company channels. I did not assume bad intent, but as these memes are often used in hate speech and trolling, it rubbed me the wrong way. I messaged him privately, and politely asked him to stop using these emojis, I provided some links to why these are sensitive and best to be avoided in workplace settings. His reply was literally ""Lol mate"". At this point I got a sneaky suspicion that he isn't using these emojis innocently, so I took screenshots of where he used them, and of my messages to him, and forwarded to HR. HR agreed that it's best to err on the side of caution, and said to leave it with them. We are an absolutely no hate speech and no discrimination company, and it's written into our Code of Conduct which all employees have to sign. I don't know what exactly did HR do, but now I heard from another colleague that I'm an asshole for getting a guy in trouble at work over ""some stupid emoji"".

AITA?

EDIT: I should've elaborated that it wasn't just one Pepe The Frog, but a whole collection of emojis (Chad, Wojak, NPC with several variations on these) that may be innocent on their own, but uploaded as a bundle and then used a lot and out of context raised a red flag with me.

1,1fmcvcv,"AITA for calling my fiance to ""grow up"" over his picky eating?","My (27F) fiance (29M) is an extremely picky eater, and lately, I’ve been feeling really frustrated with his extreme pickiness when it comes to food. He has a very limited diet and refuses to try anything outside of his comfort zone. He doesn't eat meat or vegetables, his diet typically consists of stuff like pizza, macaroni, cereal, and bread with the occasional fruit on the side.

This has made it extremely frustrating whenever we eat out. If we're getting something to eat, we have to only go to places that serve anything he wants, which limits our options to mostly just fast food or pizza places. He's offered to go out to other restaurants with me, but he never ends up ordering anything when we do and it's extremely embarrassing. He never eats anything I cook, and typically just sticks to making his own food.

This came to a head when we visited my parents last week. We sat down to eat together, they know he doesn't eat meat so prepared a vegetable dish. When we were eating, he only ate a small portion of it, and I could tell from how little he had eaten he wasn't going to finish it. My parents asked what was wrong, and he thanked them for the food, but said he just wasn't that hungry and ended up just fiddling with the rest of it and threw most of it out after dinner. I was mortified.

On the way back, he wanted to stop and get food and I kind of laid into him. I told him he embarrassed me, was rude to my parents to not eat the dish, and that he seriously needs to grow up and stop eating like a manchild. This isn't the first time we've had an argument about this, but it is the first time I've been this mad. Last summer we visited my extended family at my uncle's lakehouse, and he basically only ate frozen pizza and cereal the three days we were there, which caused issues since my nieces and nephews were there and I felt it set a bad example for them.

He got really hurt and hasn't talked to me much for the past few days. I feel bad, but at the same time, I'm just tired of this.

So, AITA? I feel I could have been nicer and more accomodating, but it's not like he has a medical condition that forces him to eat this way. I'm just so tired with him not even being willing to try and continuing to eat like a 5 year old.",Asshole POO Mode,2024-09-21,"AITA for calling my fiance to ""grow up"" over his picky eating?

About a month ago, I was asked to be on the planning committee for an event at my university and I was really excited about it and have been planning it since then. Yesterday, my boyfriend was looking over my shoulder at my notebook where i had written down details about the event and asked „Is that on my birthday?“ and I completely froze. 

It may sound completely stupid but I had somehow not realized that the event was on the evening of my boyfriend’s birthday. I hadn’t completely forgotten about his birthday, I even already have a gift! If you had asked me when my boyfriend‘s birthday was, I would’ve immediately given you the correct answer. I just somehow didn’t make that connection that that was the date of the event. It’s so stupid, I know.

I feel so bad now. My boyfriend says it’s fine and he doesn’t mind, his mom is also visiting that day and he‘ll just have dinner with her. We can still spend the rest of the day together until the evening and I‘ll come back from the event at around midnight. We can also do something nice the evening before and on the weekend. I‘m still thinking about dropping out of the event though, which would also be shitty because people depend on me being there.

4,1fmc3eb,AITAH for being upset my (25M) boyfriend refuses to spend $11 on me (20F)?,"For context my bf and I have been together for around 8-9 months now, meeting when we were 19 and 24 respectively, and his behavior has changed radically over this period of time.
When I initially met my bf he was a very sweet guy, buying me flowers and taking me on trips in and out of the country. But more consistently he ALWAYS bought me food, like even when I didn't ask. Around early june this year my boyfriend came to stay with me and my family and due to some issues with my toxic mother she kicked him out and I made the decision to leave with him. My boyfriend and I had been staying in different Airbnbs until we eventually ended staying with a family friend who we are still with now. The issue comes in here, as my boyfriend is not a US citizen he had to return to his home country as his VISA ran out, and he is currently working on securing a flight back.
Before my boyfriend left I found out that I was pregnant, though we are in the process of trying to get an abortion due to legislation in my state it is becoming very expensive and complicated. On top of that I am suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum which is causing me to have extreme nausea and sickness, often resulting in me throwing up even things as
simple as bread and plain water. This has made it very hard for me to go about my day to day and I am exhausted from the lack of nutriants.
My boyfriend is aware of this but still insists that I get up and try to take walks or cook. When I try to inform him it is not that easy for me to do these things he says I am being overdramatic.
Earlier today I had asked for him to buy an $11 bowl of vietnamese noodles called phô to which he said he had to put some money together but he would help me get.
After awhile I had asked if he could order it as I was getting increasingly hungry and he told me that he does not owe me anything. As I have no money $11 is like a million dollars to me because I have nothing. He then proceeded to tell me that he has bills that he needs to pay but during that same argument he said if he felt nice enough to buy it he would but he doesn't have to.

We used to share everything, either face-to-face or over the phone, with calls averaging 1.5 hours. After high school, we went to different universities in different states, so we mainly kept in touch by calling.

During foundation, we talked regularly because I had more free time. I also started calling my mom daily, chatting for about 30 minutes. However, once I started my degree, my schedule became much more demanding. I have core classes from 8 AM to 4:30 PM, seven days a week, and university-required classes from 3-5 PM until 7 PM, 3-4 times a week. Outside of class, I have to study for problem-based learning, which is also graded, and usually study with friends until around 1 AM.

With such a tight schedule, I barely have any time for myself. I set aside 30 minutes of my time for my mom. Other than that, I spend my free time watching anime or kdramas, reading, lazing around or sleeping to keep myself from going insane due to stress.

Layla called me a few times, but it was always during classes or study sessions, so I couldn’t pick up. Even when she called during my me-time, I didn’t answer because I didn’t want to use my only downtime for long conversations. When I did talk to her, she’d keep the conversation going for hours and I'm quite a pushover. I suggested she text me instead, so I could respond during lectures or in between classes.

Eventually, Layla got upset, saying I was always busy and she felt alone because I never picked up. I explained my schedule in detail, even sending her my timetable, and told her again that texting would work better for both of us. But she continued to call, only texting to ask if I could talk, which I often couldn’t.

I couldn't exactly use Google translate in this situation because well you know it's Google translate and I don't have any friends who knows that language, so I asked the director if she could connect me with the actor (M 27 ig not sure?) who speaks that language and they did. 

They connected me with him and we had a call yesterday where I was just asking some basic questions about how he learnt my mother tongue and if he had any career switch or did he just jumped into becoming an actor. I wanted to know more about his proficiency in my mother tongue as it would help me explain the dialogues that I need translation for but he just hung up the call. 

I didn't think much of it and continued with my day until I recieved a text from the director. She mentioned that the actor guy found it unusual that I asked him about his career switch thing. I mean I graduated in computer science and where I come from a lot of people who are first in the IT field switched careers to films or something to pursue their passion.

My dad remarried when I was 8 and made a blended family with his wife and her two kids. Then they had two kids together so I have step and half siblings. My mom's family were a big part of my life for the first 6 years and then my dad and them fought because my dad had met his wife by then and he didn't like their reaction to the news. Essentially he wanted to invite them over for my grandparents yearly family BBQ and my grandparents didn't want to include them. They told him they couldn't accept my mom's replacement. He got mad at them for feeling that's what he was doing and he told them they could forget about seeing either of us again. He tried to keep me from them but they filed for grandparents rights and dad's lawyer said they'd win so he said I could see them once every three months for 4 hours. It was way less than I was used to but it didn't stop me being close to them.

He invited them to his wedding and they didn't come. It pissed him off more and then he got super weird about it and he suddenly started demanding invites again for his wife's kids when I was invited and then when my half siblings were born, he was including them in the attempt to force my family's hands. But they never invited them. They did ask me if I wanted them there and I said not really. So they didn't change their mind. My dad always bitched about them whenever my visits would come around. He really hated that I went and my step and half siblings couldn't. He tried to tell me I should advocate for them all to be included. I never replied to him because it was easier not to.

Once I turned 14 he got worse with that stuff and he'd complain that I was calling and texting them and that I kept in touch more than the once every three months. He'd tell me they hate my siblings, that he didn't want us to have our family. I told him that didn't upset me or make me mad and it didn't change that I wanted to see them.

The day I went back to school (senior year) my dad told me since I was graduating in May and I'd be 18, he needed to make it clear that I will need to choose. Because I can't keep spending time with people who refuse to include most of my family and he told me I'll have to choose my family or ""them"". I told him the ""them"" were my family and I'd choose them. He didn't expect the answer. He got pissed and told me I should always choose siblings over extended family. Then he acted like I hadn't given my answer because he told me when he and his wife throw me the graduation party that I won't be allowed to invite my mom's side. I told him he didn't need to throw me one because they would and I'd made it clear my choice will be them. Dad told me that isn't how it works. I told him it is because he gave the ultimatum and he needs to live with the consequences. He accused me of twisting his words and disrespecting him by throwing that in his face.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for telling my dad he's the one who gave me the ultimatum so he needs to deal with the consequences? My mom died when I (17m) was 5. My dad remarried when I was 8 and made a blended family with his wife and her two kids. Then they had two kids together so I have step and half siblings. My mom's family were a big part of my life for the first 6 years and then my dad and them fought because my dad had met his wife by then and he didn't like their reaction to the news. Essentially he wanted to invite them over for my grandparents yearly family BBQ and my grandparents didn't want to include them. They told him they couldn't accept my mom's replacement. He got mad at them for feeling that's what he was doing and he told them they could forget about seeing either of us again. He tried to keep me from them but they filed for grandparents rights and dad's lawyer said they'd win so he said I could see them once every three months for 4 hours. It was way less than I was used to but it didn't stop me being close to them.

He invited them to his wedding and they didn't come. It pissed him off more and then he got super weird about it and he suddenly started demanding invites again for his wife's kids when I was invited and then when my half siblings were born, he was including them in the attempt to force my family's hands. But they never invited them. They did ask me if I wanted them there and I said not really. So they didn't change their mind. My dad always bitched about them whenever my visits would come around.

","I (24F) have been with my boyfriend (25M) for two years. At the beginning of our relationship, he’d often mention the type of women he was attracted to, and they were nothing like me. I’m very skinny, and it’s hard for me to gain weight, whereas the women he finds attractive are fuller. I didn’t think it was a dealbreaker because I believed that when you love someone, you love them as they are, even if they don’t fit your usual ""type.""

We both watch porn sometimes and if someone looks good, we might point it out. But lately, I’ve been feeling more and more insecure. For example, when we’re watching a movie and he says things like, “Damn, that turned me on,” or “That dress is my weakness,” it makes me sad because the women he’s talking about look nothing like me.

When I told him how these comments made me feel, he said it’s just about clothes or moves he’d like me to try, and that he’d even buy the outfits for me. But that’s not the issue—I could wear those clothes, but it wouldn’t feel like me.

Another layer to this is that my boyfriend has a foot fetish, which I don’t mind in theory. However, I’ve had four major surgeries—three on my left foot and one on my right—leaving scars. This makes me incredibly insecure. He says he’ll still love my feet no matter what, but I know things have changed, and I’m unsure if that’s something I can fully believe.

I’m at the point where I’m seriously considering breaking up with him because I feel like he’s not truly attracted to me as I am, and I don’t want to feel like I have to change myself to make him happy.

11,1fmazho,AITA - Caring for my neighbor's cat,"About a month ago, a cat started wandering into my yard. After a day or 2, it started being friendly, and i bought it treats - mainly to have a way to distract it when i needed it away from my car so i could pull out of the driveway. Hell, after a couple of weeks, it even spent the night with me on my couch. Fast forward to Labor Day morning - i find out it belongs to the neighbor's adult daughter across the street. (we've never spoken to these people, until then). It wears no tags.

Well, it'll come over a couple times a day. I'll give it treats, play with it, hell, i bought it food and will give it a small bit now and then. When it comes in, it just walks around the house, curious. Sniffs, rolls around. nothing more.

This morning, the owner saw it over here, so I picked it up and walked it across the street. She asked me to ""not let it in the house this winter, because it's an outside cat and they want it to get used to being outside, and not wanting in the house.... it has an Igloo in the back, so it'll be warm"".  And i'd ""much rather hear it from her, than her mother, who can be kind of a bitch"".....

I simply said OK, but internally i was SCREAMING.  NO, it won't be ""warm""; not in the middle of an Oklahoma ice storm with -10 windchills.   And if your elderly decrepit mother has a problem with it, she can hike her ass across the street and tell me to my face.

So, am i wrong in thinking that if it shows up on my property, to let it in my house and not let it freeze to death on my porch? Because i'll be damned if i'm gonna let THAT happen.   Hell, in this town, we're honestly lucky someone hasn't shot the poor thing yet.

BTW, I looked up local code, and since it's not wearing tags showing recent rabies vaccine or that it belongs to someone local, i COULD call animal control and report it abandoned as it is. 

SO.......... AITA for letting the cat into my entryway to warm up this winter, if it's on my property and freezing cold, even though the neighbor asked me not to?  AITA for thinking if you don't want people to do something nice for your animal, to keep it on YOUR property and OFF of mine?

18,1fma95w,"AITA for dismissing my neighbor's complaints about a ""cat stink"" coming from our apartment?","I (F25) live with my mom (F50s) and sister (F21). In June we moved into a 4 bedroom apartment, and our 9 cats came with us. We've all been adjusting great, except for this one issue w/ neighbors, whom I’ll be calling Sheryl and Joe (60ish).

In early August one of our cats got severely ill and spent a week in the vet hospital. We visited him every day and a lot of the housework was neglected, including taking out the trash. One evening mid-week my mom and I decided to tackle it.

The worst of it was spoiled food, but there was also one bag of scooped cat litter and some other random stuff. We used a bunch of bags to try and contain the smell.

When we left with the trash, Sheryl called the front desk and complained about a ""cat stink"" in the hallway, and said it wasn’t the first time. The doorman came to check and said the hallway did smell like trash (he was right), but that no one had ever complained about smells before. We took responsibility and have been mindful of the trash since. No other complaints have coincided with it being taken out.

The week after, the janitor confided in my mom that same neighbors had started to complain about the ""cat stink"" now coming from *inside* our apartment. 

A day or two later we were cleaning near the front door as the neighbors left their house and exclaimed ""Ugh, what a stink!"" outside our door as they left. My mom went outside and tried to smell what they had, and even asked me if I could smell anything off. I said no, just the building’s cleaning product.

A few days later we came home and found a bottle of scented oil on the floor between our apartments. I assume they left it there.

Today we once again returned home from the vet. Janitor came over to talk, saying neighbors had again complained about the “cat stink”. He said he didn’t smell anything. Sheryl was returning home and witnessed the conversation. She confirmed that the complaint had come from her, said the smell was so bad it was bothering her and her guests, and obviously we were desensitized to it. If it’s worth anything we've had close guests staying over twice since and they assured us the house smells fine. 

Now we're at a stalemate. Sheryl & Co insist there's a horrible smell coming from our home due to the cats. We don’t smell anything. They might be taking it up with the super next. We've become hypervigilant about any sort of smells in our house, cat related or not. The house can be sparkly clean and we're still obsessively going around sniffing the air.

So... AITA for not taking the neighbors' complaints seriously after the first time? I just can't help being suspicious of their timing, as they began well over a month after we moved in and only after they saw us with one of our cats. But if we're in the wrong I want to know so we can apologize and fix it, as I don't want to be the cause of anyone feeling discomfort in their own home.

21,1fm9chv,"AITA for inviting my friend to my 21st bday, only to have plans change? ","Me and my best friend E were going to have a joint 21st bday weekend at the beach. She had invited one of her friends, B. 

In addition, I had a long-distance friend, F, who was going on a cross-country trip and planned to stop in my state. She wanted to take me out to dinner for my bday. 

She originally wanted to meet up with me on Monday, after the beach. But she called me on Friday night (when I was already at the beach with B and E), and asked me if she could see me on Saturday (the next day) instead. My friends were okay with it because F offered to take them out to dinner, too. 

F was in a state that was 8 hours away. Her plan was to start driving Saturday morning, she would get a place at the hotel we were staying at, and she would get there in time to take us to dinner. She made a $200 deposit at this hotel in advance. 

On Saturday, when we were getting ready, B randomly said that we were gonna meet up with her boyfriend. This was a last-minute plan that I had no idea about. B’s bf lived in a city that was 40 minutes away, and B wanted for us all to spend the whole day in this city. I said no way! We have to be there for F! She’s driving 8 hours to see us! 

But B totally disregarded my concerns. She yelled at me, in the hallway of the hotel, to call F. “If F is a good friend, she’ll drive 40 extra minutes,” is what B kept saying. 

So I called F just to get B to stop yelling at me. And when F picked up the phone, she had just woken up; F started freaking out because she had accidentally slept in. It was 12pm and she still hadn’t even left yet (she had planned to leave at 8am because it was an 8-hour drive). 

 Because F had overslept, I felt less shame about telling her the situation *I* was in. I thought that this would be a good reason to tell her we should just reschedule: I was starting to realize that B was a red flag, and I didn’t want F to be around that either. 

But when I started to explain the situation, F wasn’t having it. She cut me off and said I was being rude. She had spent $200 to stay at that hotel, which was something I forgot about. So I was trying to think of ways to work around her schedule (because she still wanted to come see me, despite oversleeping). 

I tried to tell F that if she still wanted to visit, there was no way I would make her drive 40 minutes out of her way. But she thought I was rude for even suggesting that we reschedule in the first place, and she said I was choosing B and E over her.

Hearing the hurt in F’s voice broke me, and it didn’t help that B snatched the phone from me and started fighting with F. F hung up and that was when I lost her as a friend. 

I could not function emotionally for the rest of the day, and B and E kept complaining that I was a downer and that my attitude was ruining the rest of our vacation.

22,1fm98di,AITA for misunderstanding?,"Hi there, first time posting. Here's the situation: I (M15) am a member of my school's student tech squad. We do audio control during school events. There's 10 of us and one student tech manager(M17), I'll call him Adam. Up until the previous school year ended, that was it in terms of hierarchy (there's a teacher supervisor but she lets us do our thing). 

Then, in the first week of vacation, two techs (let's call them Mary(F16) and Dave(M15)) were summoned to the school to change the PA system's settings (we'd had some problems with it being way too loud). They managed to slightly ameliorate the issue, but not so much so that it stopped being one.

I was summoned alongside the two and Adam to set up the audio equipment for the year beginning ceremony (English is my second language). I entered the school alongside Dave. He gave me an ID badge (something we didn't have before) that had my name on it and ""technician"" written right under. I thought it was strange, since we're all known as techs, but I didn't protest. Then, I noticed Dave had ""coordinator"" written on his. Now, I have nothing against him, but that I thought was an attempt at undermining Adam, whom I like.

""How could that ever be malicious?"", you may ask. Let's rewind the tape a bit. In January, the tech squad was making a social media account. One of the techs  created one, but chose a predictable password and someone got in. So I made a new one and said I'd handle the social media stuff from then on. That's where Mary chimed in and said, loudly enough to mute my offer, that she'd handle it, to which the teacher supervisor agreed. I didn't want to be problematic, so I gave her the login details. 

Then I found out Mary had Dave cooperate with her despite me offering (The account is long inactive).

Another situation was in February, when our school's big charity event was happening. Dave had signed himself up to be one of the techs there (as did I and some other techs), but Adam rejected Dave's offer (I later found out that Dave had another task for the event and messed it up badly).

Now Dave and Mary both had ""coordinator"" written on their badges. Adam and a few other techs mentioned how stupid that was in a conversation that didn't involve the two and I agreed. 

Snap back to present times, when I'm playing music through the PA. Suddenly, my phone's volume went really low, so I put it back up. Accidentally too high, so I immediately put it at an acceptable volume. I look at my phone  to see a notification from the tech squad group: ""who's messing with the speakers?"", sent by Mary. 

Mary has a record of misnaming things(she didn't this time), so I thought she'd meant the PA, and responded ""me"". Her response can trigger someone so I won't quote it. Essentially, it was painful to read and brought up some issues I used to have. I politely asked her to apologize, and she tried to emasculate me. I've been avoiding her since.

Despite our differences, I thought we were at least civil, until recently.

My sister is getting married next year, and she’s been really excited about finding *the* perfect wedding dress.

Fast forward to a few weeks ago. We were at a family gathering, and I was wearing this dress I felt good in, but I’m not a size 2. Out of nowhere, my sister made a snarky comment in front of everyone about how “brave” I was for wearing something so “tight.” I was embarrassed, but I didn’t want to make a scene, so I let it slide.

Later that night, she made another comment, this time in private, about how she’d *never* wear something like that unless she lost weight. I got upset and told her that what she said really hurt my feelings, but she brushed it off, saying she was “just being honest.”

Now, I don’t feel like helping her out with the wedding dress anymore. I told her this, and she flipped out, calling me selfish and petty. She says I’m “ruining her big day” over a joke and that it’s not fair for me to back out when I already agreed to help.

25,1fm93rm,AITA My boyfriend (21M) wants me (22F) to remove ALL my male followers on Instagram. Am I in the wrong or is he too controlling?,"tl;dr


My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, and recently he asked me to remove all my male followers on Instagram.

For context, before we dated, I occasionally posted bikini photos (maybe 3 in total), and he knew this. Once we got together, I took them down because I was adjusting my feed. We then discussed him not wanting me to post revealing photos, and while I didn’t agree, I eventually gave in after several arguments. On my birthday last year, I posted a bikini pic from a beach trip, and he got really mad, demanding I take it down. After more arguing, I gave in.

We made an agreement that I wouldn’t post anything showing cleavage, my butt, or anything “too revealing.” Despite following the agreement, we kept having arguments about my posts. A month ago, I went hiking and posted a picture of me in a sports bra (no cleavage) and leggings. The shot was from behind, showing me climbing some rocks. He said it looked “too sexual” and demanded I take it down. I asked my friends for opinions, and they all said it wasn’t sexual at all, but he kept pushing, and I eventually deleted it.

A week later, I posted an Instagram story flaunting my abs in a mirror selfie, where a bit of cleavage showed. Again, we argued, and I took it down. He warned me that if I posted something like that again, I’d have to remove all my male followers.

Yesterday, he looked through my highlights and found an old bikini photo still up, as well as the abs photo. He was furious, cursing at me and demanding I remove all my male followers, including gay friends, leaving only my relatives. I told him I didn’t know the bikini photo was still there, as I have many highlight albums, and I offered to take it down. He said I had “lied” for a year and a half and didn’t deserve to negotiate. He then gave me an ultimatum: choose between him or my male followers.

At first, I chose my “male followers” because I was tired of him trying to control me. He said he was losing feelings for me because I “prioritized them over him.” In the end, I gave in and removed all my male followers, even my classmates and friends.

This isn’t the first time he’s tried to control me. He doesn’t like me wearing crop tops or shorts in public, even though I don’t wear anything too revealing—just crop tops and skirts or shorts that don’t show my butt. This came up after I slept over at my gay best friend’s house with my girl bestie after a night out. I couldn’t get home because it was too late, so I called both my dad and boyfriend to let them know. My dad was fine with it because he knows and trusts my gay bestie, but my boyfriend wasn’t thrilled. A few days later, he became angry, saying that even though my friend is gay, he’s still a man and has “a dick.” Because I broke our agreement about not staying over at a guy’s house, he punished me by trying to control what I wear.

There have been other controlling behaviors, too. For example, he’s told me I couldn’t go out drinking with my girl friends, and once gave me an ultimatum that if I took even one sip of alcohol, he wouldn’t talk to me for two weeks.

I just don’t understand why he doesn’t trust me. I’ve never cheated, entertained anyone else, or given him any reason not to trust me. Even when people have confessed their feelings to me during our relationship, I shut them down. I don’t message other men unless it’s for schoolwork, and I barely even go out. I’ve only been to a bar twice in my life.

",TL;DR,2024-09-21,"AITA My boyfriend (21M) wants me (22F) to remove ALL my male followers on Instagram. Am I in the wrong or is he too controlling? tl;dr


My boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years, and recently he asked me to remove all my male followers on Instagram.

For context, before we dated, I occasionally posted bikini photos (maybe 3 in total), and he knew this. Once we got together, I took them down because I was adjusting my feed. We then discussed him not wanting me to post revealing photos, and while I didn’t agree, I eventually gave in after several arguments. On my birthday last year, I posted a bikini pic from a beach trip, and he got really mad, demanding I take it down. After more arguing, I gave in.

I’m scared if I make a noise she think I’m spying on her or messing with her.

During lunch, one of my coworkers saw my lunch and said ""Wow! That looks so cool! I love cooking but I never have the motivation."" And from there we started talking about cooking, baking and our experiences.

I talked about making the cookies from the video and stuff like that and she said ""ohh if you have some more, I would love to try some!""

I laughed a bit and then I had to get back to work. Now that I am thinking back to it, I am worried it would be rude to not give her a cookie since I do still have a few at home.The only reason I don't want to give them away is just because of how time consuming it was to do and I'm too lazy to make another batch for myself again.

I feel like its a good idea to build up a good rapport with my coworker, but I also want to save my cookies.

28,1fm8egc,WIBTA for telling my coworker to stop with his uncomfortable mixed signals?,"
There’s a guy I work with who claims he is married and recently had a baby. We had a pretty decent work friendship at the start. We bonded over a couple of shared interests and overall had a great time working together. He called me his bro and even exchanged numbers (we’re both guys).

As we get to know each other more, I notice that his behavior has gotten a bit strange. For example, one time we were talking and college got brought up and he told me that he went but never got to finish. Naturally, I asked how come and he just went dead silent with no eye contact (I was talking to his side profile from afar). I tried asking again in case he didn’t hear me and he rolled his eyes, scoffed, and said I was bullying him. Likewise, if I ask him any personal questions, he will quickly deflect or shut down. He would shoo me away  at times when I would come up and talk to him but then approaches me later on with conversation as if that never happened. He would aggressively tease and joke at my expense. I like jokes but it got a bit much.

So I ended up pulling back a bit because I didn’t want that kind of energy around me. He’s taken notice and now, he’s acting much kinder/more welcoming towards me, he tries to cheer me up when he notices I’m down (never seen him do that for any other coworker), make comments on when I’m in a good mood or not, he hovers around me, shows more interest in my personal life (still never shares his though), etc. I went through a big, toxic situation with another coworker there (was not my fault) and he ended up being the only one to reach out to me, checking up on me and asking if I was doing ok. I totally wasn’t expecting that from him. 

But the most important detail of all is his constant staring. Throughout everything I’ve said till now, I’ve caught him on numerous occasions giving me looks and glances. It got so strange to the point where he stared me down hard through his car window. After work that day, I just sat in my car for a bit and scrolled through my phone to unwind. But you know that feeling you get when someone is burning a hole through your face with their eyes? That’s how I felt and so I looked to my right and he was hunched over, just watching me intently from inside his car. When I started to look his way, he instantly turned his head away and started fidgeting with his radio settings and then drove off. Didn’t even notice he was in his car in the first place. I thought it was the strangest thing ever.

Overall, it’s just making me uncomfortable to work with him.  It’s like he has one foot in the door and one foot out. I don’t know what he wants.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"WIBTA for telling my coworker to stop with his uncomfortable mixed signals?

I (F19) was going through a tough time after a betrayal from someone I cared about (Adrian ) and became manic and dissociated as a result, 3 months later i got talking with 3 to 5 one of them being jake we know ome another since 2 yrs and i would always ignore his tries to talk but after this betrayal i was welcoming anyone tbh, he sent me a meme accidentally then quickly deleted it i said i saw it tho, why delete, he apologized and said it was a mistake and then we talked briefly, we had many common beleifs(i was lying) and he said later ""you're one of the top members of my share list so posts will keep coming don't mind"" internally i was like cool someone to talk, a temporary friend 
During this time, a guy (Jake) started contacting me daily by sending memes/reels to stay in touch.the reels he'd send to everyone and were random af. We called each other ""bro"" and ""sis,"" and there was no flirting or romance. I never initiated contact and saw it as casual friendship.
In the first couple of weeks, I used Jake for distraction and emotional support, and he shared personal stuff with me (like his mom’s schizophrenia and his own issues). I offered him some emotional support because I’m naturally kind to my friends. However, Jake kept the daily communication going, and over time, he seemed to get emotionally attached. I noticed he was becoming more persistent and maybe catching feelings, even though he made it clear he didn’t want a relationship, and neither did I.and since neither of us did something like a relationship, except daily online contact via random reels, i thought it's a friendship plus bro and sis zoning 
Eventually, I started distancing myself as i got better and my issues with Adrian solved, but Jake kept expecting daily interaction through memes, which started to feel like an obligation. I wasn’t emotionally attached to him, only 5 weeks had passed and when it felt burdensome, I blocked him.

Now I’m questioning whether I led him on by providing minimum emotional support and daily contact. Was I wrong for cutting him off after realizing he became emotionally attached, even though there was no romance or flirting? Did I unintentionally give him emotional benefits like a girlfriend without commitment?(i did nothing but talk lime a friend) i have ocd so i might overthink, after blocking him and thsoe dudes after a month, me and Adrian reconciled

My shop owner wants me to have them reach out to the client if they reach out to the shop directly like via Instagram or our form on our website. One of two of my artists hate this and would want the client to reach out to them directly. I send them the information I get from the client and in exchange give the client the artist's contact information in case they have questions or alterations before the artist reaches out. I thought this was a happy medium. 

  
Well, a client was deaf and had a message on her phone that she had messaged an artist and she had a consultation with him. Since I don't have access to the artists books, I took her for her word and told the artist that his consultation is here. He comes in and is like, "" I need more information than just your consultation is here. I didn't know she was coming."" I was confused and irritated because I often have clients either not tell me what they want or a shortened version of what they want. I also asked what his availability was for walk-ins because I had a gentleman call asking about a walk-in. This artist always just has me tell the client to come in, which wasn't possible for this client cause it was a distance for them. We end up getting quite snippy with each other because I have had enough of all his sarcastic or just rude remarks that I am constantly hit with on the regular. We both apologized to each other but his rude remarks escalated to borderline threats so now I am using the ""Don't react cause it's what he wants.""  method. He then said I was being sensitive and overdramatic when I didn't react to his remarks.

33,1fm7pvz,AITA for not letting my sister-in-law throw a surprise party at my house?,"So, here’s the situation: my sister-in-law, (ill call her) Jane, recently decided she wanted to throw a surprise birthday party for her husband, (ill call him) Jeff (my brother). The only issue is that she wants to have it at my house. I’ve got a nice backyard and a big open-plan living area, and apparently, Jane thought it would be “perfect” for the party.  
  
The thing is, my wife and I have a two-year-old son, and we’ve got another baby on the way. We’re exhausted all the time, trying to keep up with our little one while managing work, household chores, and preparing for the new baby. Our house is also a bit of a mess right now with renovations going on in the kitchen. We’ve got tools and materials everywhere, and the last thing I want is to host a party in the middle of all that chaos.  
  
When jane brought up the idea, I politely declined and explained the situation. I told her we’re not really in a position to host a big gathering, especially with our house in disarray and our schedules so tight. I even offered to help her find a different venue and help with party planning in other ways (like catering or decorations), but she didn’t seem to want any of that.  
  
She got upset and said it would mean so much to Jeff if we hosted, and it’s just for one night. She also said that since it’s a surprise party, she couldn’t exactly ask him for input, and she didn’t want to rent out a venue because she wants it to be “cozy and personal.”  
  
I stood my ground and said no. It’s just too much for us right now. jane then started telling other family members that I was being unreasonable and selfish, and now they’re all giving me grief for it. My mom even suggested we could “put away the renovation stuff for the day” and that “a party would help us unwind.”  
  
Am I the asshole for sticking to my boundaries? I get that Jane wants to do something special for Jeff, but I feel like I’m being pressured into hosting something I just don’t have the energy or space for right now. My wife is 100% on my side, but the rest of the family thinks I’m the bad guy for not going along with it.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for not letting my sister-in-law throw a surprise party at my house?

I hired these guys who I have heard good reviews from my friends. They started the job and they worked really hard to make it happen. The job eventually proved to be bigger than expected and instead of bailing they sticked around and worked on it that now it is actually almost done.
 
So a back in May I paid them to finish up a small part of the job but things went bad and one of the workers got injured and had to stop the work for awhile. I was totally okay with this and I checked in to make sure that he knew he could get back to it after he had fully healed. 

Fast forward to now still the job is not done and every time I ask they give me reasons, My dad is sick, I need to travel for work but I will be back etc and as a normal human being I end up sympathizing and say okay. 

I'm too trusting and try to understand people's situations and in the past people have taken advantage of this to walk all over me. 

They said they were to start the job this week but didn't show up for four days and I lost my shit today and started confronting them about it. They got angry and started reminding me how they have great recommendations and that they didn't bail on the job when it proved to be hard.

Sam and Jessica are morons when it comes to money and I've often had to bail them out. Money isn't really an issue for me but lately they've been pissing me off with constant requests for money.

My thing is that I do not like Jessica. She needs to get a job but always uses their kids as a reason why she can't. They are out of the house for most of the day and do not need her as a full time housewife. She is just lazy. Work has been tight for my brother so both of them are home all day.

I said to myself that if Jessica calls me up for money then I'm going to ask her why can't she look for a job herself? Sure enough, she asked me for $700 for a car repair. I asked her why isn't she looking for work? Predictably, she said they have four boys between the ages of 7 and 15 and she needs to be home. I said but Chris is home too.

She said she was offended and I said I couldn't care less. You're using me to fund your SAHM grift. Plenty of parents work and have done so for generations. I'm offended that you're asking me for money because you won't get a job. 

Of course my brother called me up and said that Jessica was crying and I should apologize. I said she and you can kiss my ass.

39,1fm727m,AITA for telling my mom she needs help because I deserve a better mom?,"My parents are divorced. I (15f) don't remember them being together. I was like 2 when their divorce was finalized. But there's a lot of heavy history. My parents were widowed when they met. I had two half brothers. Mom had a son ""Shane"" and dad had a son ""Riley"". They were 8 when my parents met and 10ish when my parents married. My half brothers did not like each other. It was bad. They were toxic to each other and did not want to be related through marriage or anything. Apparently the house was like a war zone and they'd wish each other dead, call each other names and they tried to break my parents marriage up multiple times. I've heard stories about this time and nobody thought my parents handled it well. But it was clear they wanted to be together more than anything at that point.

The boys were 14 when I was born and when I was 7 months old Shane died. He'd been in a car crash. My parents were devastated. Riley wasn't. He did his best to support my dad (neither of my brothers liked their stepparent or bonded with them so Riley wouldn't really offer my mom much support). But dad let him spend time at friends houses because he knew it bothered mom that Riley was so unaffected by Shane's death. The day of the funeral my mom got so mad at Riley for not showing any grief or sadness and they started fighting. She said it was like he didn't care and even though he didn't say it, he didn't care. He hadn't loved Shane or cared about him. By the end of the night mom had started pressing Riley to grieve again. She said he'd lost his brother and Riley replied that he hadn't lost anyone. It was basically the end of my parents marriage. My mom hated Riley for still feeling that way, for not caring for real. Dad wasn't going to give up Riley though. So my parents divorced and it was apparently very messy and emotional.

My mom still hasn't found any healthy coping with all of it. She's bitter. She hates Riley. She hates that Riley and I have a decent relationship. She hates that I know Riley but not Shane. She guilt trips me for talking to Riley when he's so okay with Shane being dead or for accepting gifts from him. Or when I don't make/buy something for Shane on his birthday. Any time she sees Riley she glares at him. I've even heard her growl when he's around. She's angry with dad as well. The way she puts so much on me sucks and I don't have a great relationship with her because of it. Sometimes I feel like she punishes me because I was too young to remember Shane with her.

A couple of nights ago I told my mom I think she needs help because she's let the bitterness and grief she feels get in the way of her life and in the way of being a good mom to me. I told her I deserve a better mom. She got this weird look on her face and she slammed a door that night. And she was like that until I went to dad's last night. Before I left she called me cruel.

40,1fm6u0z,AITAH for holding on to some of my school money,"For starters, my life is kind of weird and out of the usual. I'm 27, I have never lived on my own, and I'm still working on my associates. We've always been poor, living below the poverty line, but for a long time above the line at which we would get any help. Our lives have improved massively since ACA came into being, and we were able to get food bank food, food stamps and healthcare. So unsurprisingly, I qualify for school grants to pay for my tuition. My grandfather also has a small fund that he will pay my tuition out of as well. The money my grandfather sends me always goes to my mother, to contribute to the household. Any money left over from my grants, which is usually less than $2,000 a year, i stash away in my savings. Either for if I need future schooling, or if we have an emergency I now have $10,000 stashed away compared to my mother's $0 to help pay for emergencies. 

This money is not savings that I would be willing to spend on just about anything. There are three very specific use cases that I would allow this money to be spent on. Buying a house, serious medical expenses, or car repairs bills etc that would leave us seriously destitute. I do this, and do not consider this money my own, because my mother is completely incapable of saving or budgeting. She admit this herself. She talks constantly about how terrible she is with money, how stressful it is how she can't even try to budget and it just falls apart all around her and the money all disappears. I've seen this my entire life.  

I am her child care, granted my little brother is now 14 so this is a lot less necessary, i mostly take him to and from school. I work exclusively for her, and so anytime I'm making money she's making money. I have a snap card that pays for my food, I pay for my medications, clothes, shoes, furniture, everything. We have an agreement that while I am in school I will not have to pay rent, and once I am making money it would be a reasonable amount, 30% of my income so long as I continue to be a functional and helpful and contributing member of the household. I do about 50% of all housework, 90% of all yard work, 50% of all of the projects she starts and is unable to finish, work part-time for her, and I'm in school. I'm her only emotional support outside of her therapist which she refuses to see more than once a month, and I'm actively trying to find a therapist to help us improve our relationship. 

Today, she's talking about how mad she is at me again, because I feel ""no need to contribute to the household"" and I'm selfishly holding on to the money for myself. We have had this conversation about six times. Every single time I have explained that I don't consider this my money, and I'm simply holding it as an emergency fund for anyone in the household. She then says that that's incredibly hurtful, acting like she is completely unable to save money, and is so terrible with money that she can't be trusted.

41,1fm6tlm,AITA for refusing to pay the bride back for professional makeup? ,"My friend since high school invited me to be a bridesmaid at her wedding. On the group chat with the other bridesmaids she confirmed we could get our makeup done with a professional makeup artist for around $70-80 or we could do it ourselves. I confirmed I would be doing it myself and only 2 of the 6 bridesmaids agreed to professional makeup. 

I have a small makeup collection but very curated. I do my makeup every time I go into work so 2-3 times a week as I work hybrid. I did my makeup for other events such as weddings and fancy holiday parties and the photos always turns out good. But when I went to the house of the bride to get ready, she made me open my makeup bag so she could inspect it. I showed her and she said there wasn’t enough products in there and they looked used so I didn’t have what I needed to do what she wanted. I said I do what she was looking for everyday a soft matte face with neutral lipstick and shiny lid look. I showed her a photo of my daily makeup that I wear to work and said I brought a eyeshadow pot that I would add as a topper and get me to the exact look she wanted. She told me she had told all the girls that were doing their own makeup to buy all new makeup and I hadn’t complied. She had on the group chat said not to use old makeup and to get new stuff but I took that to mean not to use makeup that wouldn’t work and not that she required brand new stuff for everything. None of my makeup was old and I know how it preformed, the formulas were still good. I insisted they were fine and she began to raise her voice saying it was her wedding and I was ruining it by not trying to look good on camera. I told her I didn’t want to pay for the extra cost for makeup I could do myself and she didn’t say anything just asked the makeup artist if they could fit me in last minute and they agreed. I saw the other girls doing makeup and they had huge makeup bags and I had a small one but I don’t believe it’s means they are using even close to all of the products. 

The makeup looked exactly like what I could do to myself, the makeup artist even used the eyeshadow pot I brought. I thought because I pointed out not wanting to pay for the cost and she didn’t say anything she was paying for it. But I got a Venmo request for payment of the professional makeup. I called the bride and told her I didn’t agree to it and she got mad and argued I got it done, the makeup was on my face so I had to pay her back. I told her I could have done the exact look by myself and she told me I had “old makeup” with “ratchety brands” which made her have no confidence they would look good. I’m shocked because at least half my makeup is from Sephora and yes I also use NYX and Essence but they work just fine.

42,1fm6qv3,AITA for giving my EBF niece formula?  ,"Hi! First time poster. I'm 19 f. My family lives in a two family house-so it's me, my younger brother, and my parents, then my older brother (29) his wife( 26) and their baby (4 months). So yesterday, my sister in law asked me to watch my niece “for a few minutes"" so she could go run a quick errand. I wasn't doing anything so I said sure. My neice was sleeping, she said she'd most likely be back by the time she woke up.

The baby woke up 45 minutes later but my SIL still wasn’t back, so I tried to call her. My neice, Stella, was a bit upset because she's used to eating when she wakes up. My SIL only breastfeeds her. She doesn't pump ( she's tried). Even so I managed to keep Stella happy and entertained, until about an hour after. Then she was getting really hungry. We( my younger brother and I) kept trying to call/text my SIL but she wasn’t answering. By now she had been gone like two hours, we were worried so we called our older brother but he also couldn't reach her, he was at work though so there wasn't a lot he could do.

By now Stella was getting more and more ramped up because she's hungry and now getting tired from all the crying. Everything is really going downhill fast. Stella is like screaming and can't calm down. Me and my brother  are completely overwhelmed. Finally I remember some formula company sent my brother and SIL some free samples when she was pregnant. She had said to throw them out because formula was poison and she didn't want Stella drinking it. But my mom saved it because one of her friends is having a grand baby and she was going to give it to them. Stella was crying so hard she was having trouble catching her breath. We were desperate. So I checked the expiration dates ( all good until 2025) looked up the brand to make sure there weren't any recalls or anything( there weren’t), I used one of the bottles that she had gotten at her baby shower, and I made her a bottle. Stella was definitly upset at first and it took us a lot of trying but once she got it she drank the entire bottle and then fell asleep.

Stella had been sleeping for like an hour and a half when my SIL came home. She was super apologetic, She said She had run into friends and lost track of time. By now she had been gone about 5 1/2 hours. She was like, oh good, Stella was able to go right to sleep? And we said No, check your phone, it's been absolute chaos over here!! and we told her the whole situation.

She FREAKED OUT on us for giving Stella formula. She said we poisoned her, we ruined that Stella has only been breastfed until now, etc. We tried to explain to her Stella was STARVING but she said Stella goes much longer than 5 1/2 hours without eating at night and I was like... yeah duh AT NIGHT! I can go a long time without eating too when I'm not conscious too!

She said I’m an AH who didn’t respect her parenting decisions. AITA for giving my niece formula?? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for giving my EBF niece formula?   Hi! First time poster. I'm 19 f.

44,1fm6lw3,AITA for telling my mom that I am nothing like her,"I (17F) was having lunch with my family today when the conversation turned to me going away to college in a few weeks. I am going abroad and I will be living alone for the first time in my life. My mother was concerned about how I am going to be food shopping and she turned the whole conversation to that topic. She started warning me about overspending on groceries and impulse buying, stating that she was sure I will always be over budget for the first few months of college because I didn't know the prices of food in this new country. I

 got insulted at this as my parents have been teaching me how to manage money since I was 7 using my allowance and I always managed to underspend and save a lot of money from my allowance. I reminded her that I had been going grocery shopping with her on a weekly basis ever since I can remember and I am well versed in what a kitchen needs and what I need to cook or to stock for breakfast and snacks. I also reminded her that I have never been someone to buy things impulsively, especially not food even if i am particularly craving something or i find something that looks interesting and i want to try. I've always been good at self control. I told my mom that I already have the situation figured out and I have budgeted my groceries for every month, with a contingency in case I go over budget. 

This is where I may be the asshole. My mom said that that's not how grocery shopping works and you can't predict what you will need or how much you will spend. I said that that's how I plan to do it because I can't ever imagine myself grocery shopping the way she does. She never knows how much her grocery bill is going to be and she always buys things because they have an offer and not because she needs them. I have never seen her make a grocery list in my life. I got a bit sharp with her and told her that I am not like her and I like my lists and I am going to be buying groceries for one person, not a family of four, so it should be easier. She called me a stupid little girl who doesn't understand how the world works and hasn't said a word to me since then. AITA?

For more context: 

My family is in a difficult financial situation and grocery bills have been a point of contention in my household for a long time. 

My parents are both really bad with money and I have taken it as a general rule to learn from their mistakes so I don't get stuck in their cycle of overspending and then dealing with the consequences. 

My mother is the definition of an impulse buyer. She always has something she wants and money never sits in her wallet for longer than a month. She never saves anything.

I went out to see what was going on, and I found my mom (38M) and my dad (40M) standing around my brother while he was sitting on the couch laying back.

But this time he had no incentive to lie and it just looked like he was genuinely hurt.

When I was done eating I went over to the sink to wash my dishes, and my mom was right next to me preparing some food because we were gonna have people over. What just happened before shook me up because I had never really seen my brother like this outside of him throwing a fit, and it was very very unlikely he was making it up. I told my mom i didn’t think it was okay to let him be like this just because he’s lied in the past, and she just told me he would have to deal with it. I said again that how could she just let him be in pain and that I just thought he could be seriously injured so it’s not alright to just let him deal with it, and she went off on me on how she lives her life just for us and that whenever she’s sick or feeling unwell nobody cares (2 days ago we went to McDonald’s and she was feeling terrible, I tried my best to comfort her but I couldn’t do much) then she started crying and went to her room. I felt so bad after that and I got grounded for it too. I really don’t know if I said the wrong thing or what. Currently I’m sitting in my room waiting for our pastor to pick me up because my parents went with my brother to the hospital. AITA?

# UPDATE: My mom texted me 

**(TRANSLATED SPANISH TO ENGLISH)**


**Mom:**

“They already checked him out and he can move his head better, although it hurts”

“We are waiting for some X-rays”

“To rule out”

“Sorry if I yelled at you
Lately a lot of things have happened OP and I feel attacked by you”

“We already have experience as parents and we continue learning
But your attitude makes things more difficult”

“Everything that has happened with (brother) has been hard for me and sometimes you don't realize how much”

“If you could only imagine how much I love you (all)”

“And that nothing I do or decide will hurt you”

“You would understand many things”

“I know that (brother) will be fine”

“Behave yourself!”

“I know that you are also learning every day, but I want you to have a less complicated life”

I said again that how could she just let him be in pain and that I just thought he could be seriously injured so it’s not alright to just let him deal with it, and she went off on me on how she lives her life just for us and that whenever she’s sick or feeling unwell nobody cares (2 days ago we went to McDonald’s and she was feeling terrible, I tried my best to comfort her but I couldn’t do much) then she started crying and went to her room. I felt so bad after that and I got grounded for it too. I really don’t know if I said the wrong thing or what. Currently I’m sitting in my room waiting for our pastor to pick me up because my parents went with my brother to the hospital. AITA?

# UPDATE: My mom texted me 

**(TRANSLATED SPANISH TO ENGLISH)**


**Mom:**

“They already checked him out and he can move his head better, although it hurts”

“We are waiting for some X-rays”

“To rule out”

“Sorry if I yelled at you
Lately a lot of things have happened OP and I feel attacked by you”

“We already have experience as parents and we continue learning
But your attitude makes things more difficult”

“Everything that has happened with (brother) has been hard for me and sometimes you don't realize how much”

“If you could only imagine how much I love you (all)”

“And that nothing I do or decide will hurt you”

“You would understand many things”

“I know that (brother) will be fine”

“Behave yourself!”

“I know that you are also learning every day, but I want you to have a less complicated life”

“I love you”


**Me:**

“I love you too, mom. I'm sorry for talking back to you.”

“Is the pastor still coming?”


**Mom:**

“I think so! Go do something. He said it would take a while but to wait for him”

“If we leave earlier, no!”


Thanks for the input y’all, hopefully my brother is fine, I still love my family no matter what, there’s obviously problems that need fixing, but overall I still love my family.

48,1fm5w6x,WIBTAH if I abandon my sister,"I (F24) and my sister (F29) both live at home with our parents. For me, this is not by choice. I graduated college in May (on the other side of the country) and had a job out there too, but it got rescinded due to layoffs. So, I’m back with my parents until I can find something else. For my sister, this is entirely by choice because she is scared of going anywhere else.

For some background, my parents are extremely controlling, and throughout my child/teen years I wasn’t allowed to hang out with friends on the weekend or do anything alone. Going away for college and having independence was amazing for me.

Meanwhile, my sister has extreme anxiety and it has only continued to get worse. She can’t drive, can barely handle being a passenger when someone else is driving, and can’t really go anywhere on her own. Consequently, my parents have repeatedly told me that it’s my responsibility to take care of her. She works from home, but if she has an in-person event she needs to go to, it’s me who has to rearrange my schedule to take her. If she needs something from the store, she just will suffer without it unless I offer to take her and get it. She currently doesn’t have any friends either as her anxiety limits who she’ll talk to. Recently, my parents have told me multiple times that my sister doesn’t plan on ever getting married, so when I move out again, I need to take her with me. 

The thought of being forced to take my sister everywhere with me for the rest of my life is freaking me out. I love her, she’s my sister. She will give me almost whatever I want and I suspect it’s because she feels bad for me taking care of her. She knows she has an anxiety problem but she refuses treatment. And while I know she cares about me too, she just is also extremely overbearing and doesn’t really have boundaries when it comes to me. For example, it’s little things like she tracks my location and spams me about where I am. She has also found the login to my patient portal and read all my doctor’s notes, including therapy notes, and told my parents. I know it came from a place of wanting to help because she’s scared that I’m sick or not doing well and wants to check, but I can’t stand it. I’ve tried telling her about boundaries and about getting help for her anxiety so she can be independent, but she won’t budge. 

I’ve told my parents I don’t want to take my sister with me when I move and that she needs to be able to become independent, but they told me I’m an AH because I’m only thinking about myself and what I want versus helping my sister. I’ve told my friends and some think ITAH and some don’t. Some say she’s family so I need to make sure she’s ok and the others say I shouldn’t uproot my life for her.

49,1fm5p34,AITA for telling my older sister I feel watched and micromanaged? ,"So I’m having some trouble and just need some outside perspective on this. 

My older sister (30’s) was diagnosed with schizophrenia a couple years back. She doesn’t want help or to stay on her meds. She says she’s fine and can be convincing. She had a lot of fights with our oldest sister(30’s) she lived with (the oldest sister is another story) and she moved in with our older brother in another city. 
 So our bro(40’s) offered her to move in with them and they just ask she helps them pick up our niece 1-2x a week and watch her until they come home from work for about 2 hours max those days and to babysit when they need her to and she wouldn’t have to pay any rent or utilities living there for free essentially so she can save etc. other than picking up our niece she hasn’t had to watch her much. They didn’t even ask her to help with chores either. One day they asked her if she can watch our niece and she got upset and said no, and that she’s tired and doesn’t want to and that they should’ve asked her in advance like a couple of days but it was a last minute thing for them. Essentially she refused and our older bro was a bit upset because the agreement was for her to help watch our niece while living there. So after that they just let it die and nothing really got resolved but didn’t escalate on my bro or sil side. She used to be close with my older bro and sil but she started accusing sil of spying on her and stealing her stuff and was picking fights there and just accusing her of a lot of things.
While we know it could be her illness, she’s always been insecure, stubborn, and difficult to talk with so with the diagnosis it’s like 10x worse. Essentially after 8-10 months living there sil was tired and wanted her to move out. She left to stay with her parents for a few months while our sister stayed with bro. After sil left sister found the stuff she was accusing sil of stealing but didn’t apologize and said she doesn’t know. she moved out in May and rented a room with strangers and didn’t last a month. She accused the landlords of hacking into her computer and phone via Wifi then moved out into another house. She got into a fight with that landlord and accused them of hiring the gardener to hide in the attic to bang on the ceiling overnight. That also didn’t last a month and she moved back to my city and stayed with another family to rent a room. Within a week she accused the the 18 year old of spying on her and buying a jammer so my sister can’t record her spying on her. She was venting to me about all of this and while I knew it was influenced by her condition she was convincing it was not her and adamant they’re messing with her. Of course as a sister I was concerned for her and knowing how she ended up with bro and sil I asked him if it was a good idea if she and my mom move in with me (I wanted my mom to move in so she can save money and my sis can live with family instead of stranger/roommates) and my bro said it’ll be a good idea and she is fine as long as we just leave her alone. So we move in and immediately she’s putting cameras everywhere motion sensors and delegating how she wants stuff. And I’m fine with it until she said she wants a camera inside the house. I said no because it felt excessive and we have a dog who will bark at every little noise and let us know if someone is sneaking in. I was going through a lot on my end and I have 2 kids to care for and so I’m trying to settle in. we’re chatting and talking when she would always ambush me with questions really random “did you touch this?” And I say “no” and she goes “are you sure? It’s greasy and has fingerprints” “did you open the back door the other night?” “Did you use the dishwasher?” “Did you go downstairs last night” etc
And I’ve been tiptoeing around the house scared if I make a noise will she think I’m spying on her or messing with her I start to break out in hives. So I tell her via text after she’s asking if we opened the back door again So I tell her I’m breaking out in a rash from the stress and to please calm down. She tells me it’s not from that and from something else. I know my body and I just told her I feel a bit micromanaged and watched and if she can calm down and she gets upset and says it’s me who needs to calm down and I try to smooth it over and say yes I do need to calm down but also her please and then she kept going and saying I shouldn’t have said that and it’s me and was trying to pick a fight saying other stuff..
After that I don’t reply cause I know she is impossible to reason with and she gets mad and starts to ignore me but I’m used to my siblings doing this. They are toxic and abusive but I’m dumb enough to think they may change. A couple days go by im outside with my husband and she comes out and starts cussing at us saying “idk who the f is slamming the door but some fing slamming it etc” and I then I ask her is this how she wants us to talk to each other and she said to stop slamming the door and goes upstairs. No apology from her. The thing is I’m not slamming the door. we don’t talk again this goes in for month of me trying to be quiet and tiptoe around her and we are not speaking at all in the house, I text her and all I get is a kk so I just stop explaining myself for things and she gets mad at that also and saying it’s me who isn’t communicating. So one day I’m walking down getting the kids ready for school and she texts me “you didn’t wake me up this time so chill out” and I text back what? And she doesn’t reply. I know she’s hearing things again and is accusing me like she did sil. So I tell mom we need to get her help etc and that evening we try to talk to her but it ends up with her accusing me of everything she did with my sil and ends up an argument and the next day she locked herself in the room and didn’t leave all day and night so we got concerned and called the cops for a wellness check. She somehow convinced them that it isn’t her relapsing but me arguing with her and that I need to leave her alone. But I AM leaving her alone. I’ll be honest after almost 2 months of tiptoeing around it broke something in me that I’ll always be the villain in her eyes and that she’s committed to blaming other ppl for things and after that I stopped worrying about her. She got even more upset after I stop minding her, (I’m not being excessively loud but now I’ll play some music while I clean instead of sitting in complete silence etc. she got upset and started to leave trash outside my door bedroom door. So she started being petty and was doing things she accused me of. And so I didn’t say anything the first two times and threw the trash away. And then she threw more trash and left it on the floor. I put her bottles in a bag and she threw even more and left it outside. It escalated with her telling my mom That I’m closing the door too loud and my mom is already stressed and I was explaining to my mom that my room is next to my moms and if I was slamming the door she would’ve heard me but I was closing it normally and sister kept arguing and my mom snapped and had a breakdown and the first thing sis says to me was “see, you shouldn’t have slammed the door”…. I called I called my older bro to talk to her about moving out cause I can’t take this anymore and she says she’s going to look but it’s been 2 weeks already and she told bro she will stop throwing trash outside my door if I stop closing the door too loud.

Then then a second trip was proposed where everybody but one person was able to go. I then proceeded to remove the person that's not going. Even though the majority of that chat was us making jokes 80% of the time and 20% probably planning. 

We're all good friends, but we don't have a group chat altogether. Am I Asshole the person out the group chat? Should I have created a new group chat?

My logic was if that person wasn't going or if there maybe they may sway the group chat. even though they said they wouldn't, I was worried their presence might impact everything. He has said he's probably not going, and has done that with previous trips and I didn't want that to weigh in on the planning.

Their position is that he shouldn't have been removed as the group chat was being used as the main group chat and Them being in the group chat shouldn't impact how things are planned as as they wouldn't have an opinion on anything.

They also believe  that I should've created a separate group chat for this other trip I really couldn't have them in the group chat. Or create a separate group chat for the main group but that would've been too much.

We've been roommates for about a year now, and for the most part, things have been fine. However, over the past six months, Sarah's boyfriend ""Tom"" has basically moved in without asking me.

It started with him staying over a couple of nights a week, which I didn’t mind. But now, Tom is here *almost every night*. He’s using our bathroom, kitchen, and living room like it's his own place. He's always around, and frankly, it feels like I'm living with *two* roommates instead of one, but I’m only getting half the rent.

Recently, Sarah asked if Tom could officially move in to ""make things easier."" She said it would lower rent costs for all of us, and Tom could start paying for utilities. But here's the thing: I don't want a third person in the apartment. I rented this place with Sarah, *not* with her and her boyfriend. Plus, I value my privacy, and I didn’t sign up for this dynamic.

I told her no, and now things are tense. Sarah accused me of being selfish and said that Tom is practically living here already, so what’s the difference? She thinks I’m being unreasonable since he’s “barely any trouble,” but it’s really frustrating to come home and always have someone else around. I don’t hate Tom, but I didn’t agree to live with him.

Ok so for sure we are in the wrong here, but are we \*assholes\*? We honestly did not notice that trash bits had spread onto their yard nor on the street -- we always picked up bits that we did notice. Also yes bringing the bins up promptly would be great... but we don't leave them there out of malice... we both WFH and have 3 young kids so we do not usually bring our bins up by trash day evening just because we forget. Everyone on the street keeps bins on their side of the street 

  
tl;dr -- yes we are in the wrong and will improve but does this letter make us sound like assholes? and are we actually assholes?

My husband and I are in our 50’s and travel frequently. My sister and her husband are also in their 50’s but do not travel.

I frequently go back to my old school to visit friends because my best friend is there and my closest guy friends. Whenever I go back I always make time to hang out with the guys (21M, 20M) because we became really close over the last couple of years. A little back story to why we are so close, I moved into a house with them at school and since we were roommates we became inseparable. After we would come home from classes we would eat lunch together everyday and do everything together (go to the gym, to the store, ect.). They both at that time had never had a girlfriend before but I always encouraged them to date and even tried to set them up with my friends on multiple occasions. Before I left one of my friends we will call Tom (20 M Fake name) got a girlfriend and me and Jake (21M Fake name) were very supportive. Once I came back home I learned that Jake had also got a girlfriend and I was so happy for them. My most recent trip down I (like I always did) went to go see the boys and catch up. While we were there we always go outside and have a smoke sesh where we sit back relax and just talk for hours. This time however I wanted to invite the girlfriends because I had not been able to hang out and get to know Jakes new girlfriend and didn’t want to cause any bad blood between me and her (she does know who I am because the boys do talk about me and she even followed me randomly out of the blue because Jake told her about me). They gave each other the side eye and said that both Tom and Jakes girlfriends don’t like the idea of me hanging out with them. They said they told their girlfriends that they would not stop hanging out with me because I only come into every once and a while and we were all close before they got together. I told them they needed to communicate and talk to their girlfriend in a better way because I did not want to cause a rift between them. I went home shortly after because I felt bad and did not want to cause drama. After I went back to my friend’s dorm they followed me back and told me that they did not want to give up their friendship with me for them.

57,1fm41s9,AITA for calling out my sister's weird behavior around our family regarding her OF?,"

I (F27) have a sister (F26) who for the past 3 or so years has been doing onlyfans content. Personally at first I didn't really care that she does OF but as she continues to push it in me and our family's face and it's making us all very uncomfortable. She panders to a specific kink, bimbo fetish, which is essentially men getting off at women turning themselves into dramatically conventionally attractive sex dolls. Think of going from a plain Jane to the Kardashians times 10.


For the past few years we've seen her get extremely large boob jobs, bbls, lip fillers, cheek fillers, and basically every other plastic surgery under the sun. She can afford all these surgeries because she makes bank off this kink. I believe last year she told me she made over 80k just in a few months and I bet the numbers have only increased since then.


Okay now to the problem. Seeing our sister not only look like a plastic sex doll but TALK about her OF makes everyone in our family uncomfortable. But yesterday was the breaking point as it was also our mother's (F52) birthday. Our mother really disapproves of my sister's living, but she's never overtly said so, till now. When my sister went to cut the cake with our mom she made a weird joke about her breast getting in the way and everyone just went silent. She laughed it off and continued cutting while our mom just stared at her dissapointingly. She walked out the room and cried, Ive never seen my mom so despondent. When my sister asked what's wrong, our mom went off. She said lots of things but mainly that she's turned herself into a plastic hooker with no self respect just for some cash and that she lost all morality. 

She tried to defend herself but everyone has been sick of her weird comments like this. After them arguing back and forth I just pulled her out of the room and told her that mom's right. She's been making weird jokes/comments about her OF and surgeries for years and everyone's sick of it and wishes we can just go back to a normal family.

She freaked out and called us all prudes who can't handle joke, she also implied that we must be jealous of all the money she makes. I just told her to go fuck off and stop being such a hypersexual weirdo. She stormed off and drove herself home that night, later she texted me saying she doesn't see herself as my sister anymore and same thing with our mom.

I (28f) was raised by my grandparents after my dad, their youngest son, died young. When I turned 16 my grandfather brought me to work with him and he integrated me into the business. I adored that man. He trained me in all aspects of his business and once I turned 18 he hired me on full time and I became his shadow. My uncles and some of my cousins worked for the business also but none of them took it very seriously. They treated it very much like the spoiled owners sons/grandsons. They were never well known or well liked in the company. I was known. I had a great relationship with the people who worked for my grandfather. I had also done every job there at some point. I cleaned, I ran errands for others, I managed, I hired people.

I was the person he asked to step up during his illness. I basically ran the business for almost two years.

Then his will showed another side of my grandfather. One that left me very hurt. My uncles and all of my male cousins, even the ones who have nothing to do with the business and would likely never work there, were all given a % of the business. I was given nothing related to the business. All because I was a granddaughter which was even stated in the will.

I broke down when we were told the contents of the will. My uncles and cousins were very dismissive and told me I shouldn't be so upset because I was just a girl after all and with me getting married soon I'd clearly focus on having my own family. They said owning any % of a business is for men. I should have known how my grandfather felt. I made the decision to resign from the company following this. At first they didn't care. Some of my uncles even looked relieved to be getting rid of me.

They told me they need my help and I should want to help keep the family business running.

  She wants to use them as she says she doesn't understand me, which in turn i ask why she doesn't just ask as for feeling not to be hurt. But she feels like the tags will help. But for me not only does it feel a bit demeaning but it feels like she is refusing to just communicate and talk it out, instead taking the easy way out.

(ALSO tone tags can ALWAYS be misused and misunderstood. And you can always feel the way you feel regardless of the tag)

60,1fm3ca2,AITA for telling my husband I shouldn’t have to ask for help with our son. ,"
My husband has always wanted me to ask him to do things around the house. He’s not the best at picking up clues and reading the room but I figured once we had our baby he’d try to work on it. He still wants me to ask and he never offers to do anything with our son. It makes me feel like I’m the only parent. I’m the one who puts the baby down at night every single day(during the week dad works, but he’s off on weekends and won’t do it.) I’m the one who gets up with the baby whenever he wakes at night because my husband is a heavy sleeper (baby sleeps in our room right now I find it hard to believe someone can sleep through a crying baby.) if I do want to sleep a few extra hours in the morning he gets super cranky and has an attitude. I’m the one who plays with our son and holds him. (Dad rarely ever holds him. He always finds something else like the stroller, playmat, swing to hold the baby instead)

Whenever I do voice my concerns about feeling alone in this he says I do it to myself because I never ask him to get up in the mornings or help with the baby during the day. When I ask/ tell him to play with the baby he doesn’t look happy at all. I keep telling him I shouldn’t have to ask for help or ask him to interact with his son he should just do it but he doesn’t seem to understand. Am I just overthinking it should I ask him to help with the baby? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for telling my husband I shouldn’t have to ask for help with our son.

61,1fm29hu,AITA For refusing to wear what my mum spent 8 hours sewing for me ,"My (22f) first comic con is tomorrow and I had planned to wear a bodysuit version of the fallout jumpsuit with some jeans. While I wanted to rep my favourite game I wasn’t quite confident enough to go all out with the full suit.  I decided this might be a fun opportunity to learn how to sew so I spent roughly 20 hours and $60 on fabric, patterns materials and the body suit only to end up only getting halfway. 

I decided to ask my mum for advice since she sews professionally and it was only three days away from the con. We agreed in trade for doing some work for her she said she would make the suit for me. I showed her the jumpsuit, my materials and shared my vision of it being a body suit instead. She told me I was struggling because the fabric I picked wasn’t right. Therefore she was going to pick up some different blue stretchy material and use the other things I bought to assemble the suit. Today (the day before the con) I learn instead of making the suit she has spent 8 hours making a glittery rainbow full jumpsuit since they were out of stock of blue fabric. She suggested I could be a lizard lady or equivalent instead. While I appreciate her effort I am pretty devastated about not being able to be in my planned outfit since I only wanted to dress up since I love the game. I have now refused to wear the outfit and she is really disappointed her hard work is going to waste. 

So I just want to know am I the asshole for being upset and not wearing the outfit which took her 8 hours? 

Edit:
Just to answer some questions: 
Did I show appreciation for the sewing? 
I didn’t really let on how upset I was but did try to explain that it’s really different to what I wanted, though I appreciate the effort 

What was wrong with the fabric? 
I bought the fabric based on what the back of the pattern said could be used but it was too thin for the look I was going for 

Could I have been contacted?
I was at work while she was sewing but I had my phone on me and I often reply to messages on my break, she doesn’t usually not contact because I’m at work

Did I still do the work in the trade: 
I have already done it and would have followed through either way 

Her profession: She sews soft furnishings and curtains etc, but she has experience with clothing. This was also understood to be a rush job, I wasn’t super concerned with it being 100% accurate hence no fittings etc. Also I did show her several images. 

Final edit: 
Thank you for the advice! I appreciate my mum made a mistake and I could’ve put more effort in as well. I will solidify I am thankful for the effort and go as a disco lady or something like that for Halloween instead. I also have a new understanding for sewing’s complexities and will start really early if I want to dress up next year!

I’ve tried socializing them, but it just stresses them out, and I want to make sure they’re comfortable. Recently, my best friend asked me to cat-sit her two cats for a week while she’s out of town. Normally, I’d help, but because Luna and Felix don’t tolerate other cats, I know it wouldn’t go well.

When I explained this to my friend, she got upset and said, “You love cats, so why can’t you just watch mine, too?” I feel bad, but bringing other cats into the house would be chaos for my twins.

73,1flywnk,AITA for wanting them to move out?,"Background: I'm (35) disabled, don't work, and live with my sister (33). We've lived together for over 10 years at this point. I receive SSI and pay a portion of rent/bills.



Around June, she met a new guy and they started dating. At the time, he was living with roommates and his disabled mom, in an apartment about 30-45 minutes from our place. Around July, he decided to get a new job closer to us. Due to the new job's frankly insane training practices (training every day, including weekends, for a couple hours in the early morning, until they're ""ready"" to take the test) and tight finances, they (sister and new bf) decided he'd stay at our place during training instead of making the hour-ish drive for training every day. I wasn't thrilled that he'd more or less just moved in, but I understood. It was temporary and I do agree the training schedule was nuts. Training was completed late July.



In early August, he's still here. He's talking about him, his mom, and his roommates, renting a place near us, as it would be significantly cheaper than where they're at and they would all prefer the smaller town we live in to the large city they're in. They're applying and hoping to move into the new place at the end of August. Great! I'm still not thrilled that he's still in our place, but there's a semi-definitive date for it to end.



In late August, his roommates tell him that they're significantly behind on rent and bills, and they're moving back in with their family; he and his mom have the weekend to get out (told him on Friday that they're moving out and giving up the keys on Monday). Apparently, he (and his mom) was just crashing there, not on the lease (though they did pay rent). So they (bf and his mom) move in with us ""temporarily"". It's just supposed to be until they can find a place.



One week into it, I talk to them about it and my sister brings up making it more permanent/moving into a new place, all 4 of us. I'm... strongly opposed to this at this point. They've been dating for less that 6 months. Moving into a new place would mean a higher rent payment, and if things didn't work out, it would be out of our (sister and I) price range.



I swear I'm not trying to sabotage their relationship. I like the guy well enough, he's been good to my sister and helpful around the house while he's been here. But it's been like 3 months. This feels really, really fast to me. I had, semi-jokingly, said we could think about ""combining households"" after they had dated a year, early into them dating. I'm not super comfortable that we're technically breaking our lease, because we don't have the finances to quickly get a new place if we get found out/kicked out. I just want this guy and his mom to have their own place again. My sister says she feels torn because she feels like she already caters towards me and my preferences, and she loves this guy.

We are not on good terms. We communicate via app about our kids and that's the only contact we should have and that I respond to. Unless it's an emergency and then we can text/call if needed. The reason for the bad blood is he cheated on me with the woman he's now married to. And then during our divorce she accused me of breaking into their house and stealing from them. Their house was broken into. But his wife said it had to be me, she even started hinting about it online and telling other people. I didn't do it and it was proven. Police even caught the person who did it. But my ex and her still tried to use that as a reason for him to get full custody of our kids. It didn't work but they still tried.

So we're not on good terms and that's not something I feel will ever change. It's a struggle to be civil but I do it for the kids sake. I hate the two of them though and think they're both shitty people.

He told me I have to know they were looking for help with toys and stuff and I know what they've been through. He asked how I could spite his children like that. He told me they'd love to get their older siblings old toys.

He confronted me a second time because he found out our eldest gave a couple of toys to a friends younger sibling. I knew about it but didn't confirm that to him. He still guessed and again in a face to face confrontation he called me out for not donating them to him and letting them be donated elsewhere.

I get that they were excited and wanted to see the baby however I wanted some privacy for recovery before having visitors just days after discharge from hospital, and asked my husband if they could come a few months later  We also had a live in nanny to help with the baby the first month or so. My husband said no they're here to help me so they're coming for 2 months. 

Their 2nd visit just months later - husband informed me they're coming and for longer than previously thought. No discussion with me. We had a huge fight before they arrived as his mother was unhappy that our baby addresses my mother a grandmother term which sounds similar to the term for his mother (Chinese dialects). They did not discuss this with me directly, just went to my husband and called me disrespectful which made my husband angry with me. I did not have a chance to explain that it's not uncommon where I'm from for children to use similar (but not exactly the same) terms to address both grandmothers and they can learn the difference if we teach them. I explained this to them when they arrived and they agreed not to push it. 

Third visit - no discussion with me, just informed me they're visiting for X weeks. We had the biggest fight. All the resentment I had poured out - his parents picked my induction date, our baby's name had to be approved by them because some names sounded too similar to a relative therefore was not allowed (meanwhile his sister had a baby and used a combination of my name and my baby's name), we weren't allowed to set up out cot or car seat as it was 'bad for the baby' so I struggled in hospital while he did that after birth and then didn't know how to loosen the straps to buckle baby in when we left the hospital. 

I said that I was fine if they were wanting to visit for a week (which was what I was initially informed) but any longer then they can stay elsewhere (they can well afford an airbnb/hotel) and we can meet them daily for meals. Husband told me to take baby and move to my mum's when they visit.

77,1fly9bl,AITA for excluding my friends because they became a couple?,"I (19M) met Molly (20F) in college two years ago. We started talking, and without even noticing, we became very good friends. When I met her, I was in a relationship with another girl (18F), so I didn’t see Molly as anything other than a friend.

A few months later, I broke up with that girl, and Molly almost instantly started hitting on me. It quickly became a friendship with benefits. She got along with all of my friends, and I was very happy with the whole situation. I told her several times that I didn’t want anything serious and that I enjoyed things as they were. She agreed every time we had this conversation and told me she was happy too.

A year later, I told her that I wanted to stop the ""benefits"" part of the friendship because I had started to really like another girl (19F) and wanted to date her.

Long story short, Molly got mad about it and started flirting with a friend of mine, Matt (20M). I really didn’t care, because I trusted my buddy and knew he would never agree to date a girl who had been with me.

Since I didn’t care, Molly started being friendly (and flirty) with me again, knowing that I was already dating someone else. At one point, she randomly sent me a nude—all while telling Matt that she wanted a relationship with him and that she really liked him. I obviously told Matt, intending to make fun of her for trying to seduce me and blatantly lying to him, but Matt didn’t laugh. He got really upset and tried to justify her. Meanwhile, our other friend and I told him that she clearly didn’t want anything serious with him and was just flirting with him to get a reaction out of me.

A couple of weeks went by, and I saw on her Instagram story that Matt had asked her to be his girlfriend, and now they are a couple.

This happened a few weeks before my birthday. And to my surprise, Matt didn’t even show up to my birthday party because she told him not to.

I cut off contact with her, but with Matt, it’s more difficult because he’s part of my 10+ years friend group. I told my friends about the situation, and they turned against both of them, excluding them because of me.

Molly’s version is that I played with her feelings and gaslighted her multiple times just to keep her around. She says that she loves Matt and that the nude she sent me didn’t mean she still wanted me.

This has been a really surreal experience.


Edit: As some people mentioned, I want to clarify that I don't mind my friends having some action with a girl I've also hooked up in the past, as long as it isn't a previous serious relationship, I don't care. But I for sure will never be with a girl who has hooked up with one of my friends in the past. It just feels wrong.

I was upset with Matt because he believed her without question. He just dismissed my side of the story. And I know that she lied and gaslighted him.


Edit 2: She wasn't a previous serious relationship of mine, I've stated that it was a FWB. 

That's why that is not the reason I was upset about. I was upset because of how she promised him the world, but would still flirt with me and send me a nude. I was upset because of how he dismissed everything I had to say.

I would only care who my friends date if the people involved are any of my ex-girlfriends. Molly is not an ex-girlfriend.

Setting that aside, I only have two previous serious relationships. And if they want to date any of my ex-girlfriends, I'll probably be hurt about it.

78,1flxsny,AITA for blocking my bestfriend when she needed me the most?,"For a bit of context, i (17f) met my best friend (Bella, 16f) almost 2 years ago now. We went to the same church but never really talked until December 2022. I saw her as my younger sister and she saw me as her older sister. She was the perfect best friend up until about 6 months ago.

For a bit of context, I have been struggling a lot with my personal identity and mental health for a little over 6 years (on and off though). Bella knew of my mental health struggles and even helped me out when I was feeling like things were all over and helped me out reminding me to eat proper food and to drink water. When she started struggling, I was more than happy to help out provided that I was doing alright myself. 

When I told her this, she immediately turned from my best friend into a whiney and manipulative child.

She asked how i had been and I said that I had been so busy with school assignments and didn't have anytime to myself but was coping. After that, she just walked away, saying nothing.

15 minutes later, I got a message from her, calling me slurs, saying how I am so stupid and incapable and how I was never there to support her through all of her troubles and how I am such a bad person for it, how I was the reason that she stayed going to the church that we met at, although I had stopped going last september for reasons that weren't related to her.

For a bit of context, i (17f) met my best friend (Bella, 16f) almost 2 years ago now. We went to the same church but never really talked until December 2022. I saw her as my younger sister and she saw me as her older sister. She was the perfect best friend up until about 6 months ago.

For a bit of context, I have been struggling a lot with my personal identity and mental health for a little over 6 years (on and off though). Bella knew of my mental health struggles and even helped me out when I was feeling like things were all over and helped me out reminding me to eat proper food and to drink water. When she started struggling, I was more than happy to help out provided that I was doing alright myself. 

When I told her this, she immediately turned from my best friend into a whiney and manipulative child.

My (25F) boyfriend (26M) and I just had a blow out fight about this, so where else to turn to for an unbiased opinion than the internet, lol. 

My ex (27M) and I were together for two years. Our breakup was amicable. We realized the paths we wanted for our lives weren’t compatible and decided it was best to end things. We lived together for about a year, and during that time, we rescued a golden retriever. 

When we broke up, my ex asked if I wanted our dog. I know how much our dog means to him, so I told him we could do a “split custody” if he still wanted to be in our dog’s life. Since then, we’ve exchanged our dog, Max, every two weeks with each other. We’ve had this arrangement before I got together with my current boyfriend and he was made aware of it before we started officially dating. 

Lately, my boyfriend has been making comments about how it’s weird we share a dog and that if my ex was fine with me having him, we should stop splitting time between houses. I told him the dog is just as much his as mine. 

It all blew up today where he accused me of using our dog as a cover for cheating with my ex. I told him he’s welcome to go through my phone, which he did, and found nothing. Drop off consists of maybe 10 minutes of small talk and pleasantries. Occasionally longer if there’s been changes to food or medicine, but certainly not long enough for an illicit affair. We share mutual friends, but we never hang out together, not even in groups. 

I love my boyfriend, but I’m surprised he’s suddenly so angry about this since it’s been ongoing our entire relationship. I wish the best for my ex and respect and care for him as someone I used to love, but I feel no sort of romantic connection to him anymore. I’m completely head over heels for my boyfriend and everyone knows this. I don’t hide our relationship or downplay it.

Our friends are divided: some agree that my ex has a right to our dog as much as I do since he contributes to the dogs wellbeing (vet, food, toys, we “board” him with each other when we’re traveling, etc.). The rest say it’s a weird long time commitment with my ex. 

My boyfriend is giving me a bit of the cold shoulder and our friend group is divided. I’m not sure how to proceed really.

I a 17 (M) used to date A 18(F) when I was around 15 I adventually blocked them after I broke off our relationship because they kept being like a stalker and kept following me and my friends around.

I also had this friend H 17 (M) me and him grew very close expecially due to the casual every week Thursday hangouts we planned with a bunch of friends. We kept flirting with each other and one thing lead to the other and we were dating. We dated for around 2 months before H realised he was Aro-Ace and not comfortable being in a relationship in general. He opened up to me and told me it drained him mentally and physically to be in a relationship. So we both agreed to stay friends and go on with our lives. 

Fast forward to around the time me and H broke up. At that thursday hangout A started acting strangely around everyone. Hiding their phone like their cheating on C or smth. On my birthday A kept insisting to come but I said no I really didn't want them there because I felt the vibes were off. H did come ofcourse and we had a blast but I could tell me wanted to break up with me. At work he did but we're still good friends.

At night when all of the people were gone at my birthday I got a message that C had left a group chat we had called husbands. Me and H got confused so we contacted A to say what's going on? A lied in our faces nothing's wrong and we shouldn't worry about it. Adventually C texted me saying that they left cuz they were uncomfortable so I said what's going on? And C opened up to me saying A had a crush on H ( we were still dating ) and C got really uncomfortable by it. So I got pissed and called H but It was midnight so he didn't pick up. The next morning I did and asked him bluntly are you cheating on me? And he said no so I could tell that he didn't know. I then explained to him that A likes him and he just gave a Ick and kept saying he was really uncomfortable with it. At work he broke up with me that day with a decent reasoning and I understand him fully. Again we're just friends.

At work A got the memo that C did not want to hang out and talk about this the next day so C called A instead explaining how pissed he is at A and calling them a hypocrite. Then A started going on about how C was ""flirting"" with some other guy even though C was litteraly just friends with them. So C broke up with A at work that evening and adventually I went back to work having a good time. A got called into HR and talked to her for a while. H went home because he felt bad for what he did but I didn't blame him.

After that A kept insisting to meet up and saying they don't want to go home. But I kept saying No in various ways of your not allowed or I'm not allowed or I'm busy with stuff. I hate to say it but I really don't want any contact with A anymore and the friends that have been comforting me ( the ones A said we're toxic) kept telling me I should follow my gut.

She has always been a good student at the top of her class especially in the sciences but lately she has been neglecting non science subjects, she still does OK but she needs to step up especially for the sort of colleges she is considering.

She spends a lot of time on her laptop and has always been into computers and gadgets since she was a kid. She was always weird in that regard even though she's also into typical girly stuff as well.

I don't really understand what she even does with them, she has removed windows from her laptop and installed something called fedora linux. She says things I don't really understand like she was making a kernel module for something and writing making a network server.

She has electronics that look like bare chips and circuit boards and she recently made some kind of car with cameras on it using something called a raspberry pi board, cameras, arduino boards etc. It moves around our house on it's own and automatically steers away from things and other people and runs on something she calls robot operating system. Now she is trying to actually make a drone and bought more stuff to make it.

It is honestly really cool but I want her to take a break from these things and focus on the last year of high school and prepare for college applications. I'm also concerned sometimes whether she is doing anything illegal like hacking with the long hours she spends on her computer.

I have never hosted or cooked a *full* Thanksgiving dinner except for a mini attempt in college. So I have started to plan and budget  a little to avoid too many “bumps”, as well as buy some table decor. I am excited to give this a shot! However, when I was on the phone with her this evening, she asked me to cook the meal at her house and have the dinner as well. She expressed that she would feel more comfortable being at home (we live 2 miles away in the same neighborhood).


While I’m empathetic for the changes she has experienced with her body, and have been there for her throughout the course of her recent medical problems, I would rather cook in the comfort of my own kitchen.

This will be the first full Thanksgiving meal I’ll cook and I would feel most comfortable cooking in my kitchen with appliances and tools I am used to and comfortable using.

I have never hosted or cooked a *full* Thanksgiving dinner except for a mini attempt in college. So I have started to plan and budget  a little to avoid too many “bumps”, as well as buy some table decor. I am excited to give this a shot! However, when I was on the phone with her this evening, she asked me to cook the meal at her house and have the dinner as well. She expressed that she would feel more comfortable being at home (we live 2 miles away in the same neighborhood).


While I’m empathetic for the changes she has experienced with her body, and have been there for her throughout the course of her recent medical problems, I would rather cook in the comfort of my own kitchen.

This will be the first full Thanksgiving meal I’ll cook and I would feel most comfortable cooking in my kitchen with appliances and tools I am used to and comfortable using.


I expressed my concern and that I would think about it, but would I be the AH if I were to insist to have the dinner at our home?",4.0,1.0442622900009155,1,0
87,1flwkq1,AITA for wanting my father-in-law to return my shoes after they were ruined?,"So, in my country, there’s a tradition where students have to dance at a certain event. I went to my girlfriend's house, and my father-in-law saw my leather shoes. He asked if my girlfriend's brother could borrow them for the dance, and I said yes, but asked them to take good care of them because they were leather, and I really liked those shoes.

A few days later, after the dance was over, I went to get my shoes back. They were ruined—the leather was peeling, and they were in terrible condition. They told me they’d replace them, and I was fine with that, thinking they’d take care of it.

I went with my girlfriend to buy a new pair of the same brand and style. I couldn’t find the exact ones, but I found a similar pair, though it still bothered me that they weren’t the same. While we were on our way back to her house, my mother-in-law texted my girlfriend saying that my father-in-law wanted to keep my shoes because they fit him well.

I got upset. Even though I had new shoes, those were still mine, and it felt wrong. When we got to her house, I didn’t say anything because I didn’t want to cause issues with my in-laws, so I just left.

Now, I’m still angry about it because those shoes were important to me. I don’t know if I’m being unreasonable or if I’m right to feel upset.

90,1flw7gq,AITA for arguing with my family over how I spend my money,"I (18M) collect vinyl it's something I'm really passionate about. I listen to many kinds of music, however a genre I really love is psychedelic rock. It's a genre I feel very safe in. One of my favorite bands in this genre happens to be very beloved in its own little corners, and the record can get extremely expensive (I'm talking like 1k for first printings in good condition)

I happen to have a lot of extra money saved up, and a release of my favorite album of theirs goes for around 100 in good condition, still a lot of money, but it would be worth it to me, and I'm fortunate enough to have the money to spend right now.

Currently, I live with my parents, and my parents my entire life have been incredibly controlling over anything I do, so even though I am a adult, and it's my own money, I have to ""ask"" for permission. I've been working myself up for 2 weeks to ask him if it's ok if I can order something for myself with my money, and tonight I finally got the courage.

I went up to him, showed him the item I was wanting to buy, and that's when things went downhill.

Now, I guess I thought my dad knew I liked psychedelic rock? I don't really share my interest with him because he just mocks and belittles everything I like, I guess I didn't mention it to him, and he immediately starts going off about how ""you don't even listen to psychedelic rock, have you even listened to this? What is this???"" I calmly tried to explain to explain what it was, and my dad immediately started going on and on about how ""this is so expensive! You don't listen to this kind of shit! Let me look for a cheaper listing!""

He looked for about 10 minutes before stumbling on a listing for 25 dollars off Amazon, immediately I could tell it was not a official release, and that it was in fact a scam, I tried to explain to him this fact, which lead to the screaming fit ""You don't know what you're fucking talking about, it's on Amazon they can't fucking sell fake records, that's illegal you just want the expensive one"" I kept trying to explain, which just made him more angry, I even found a Discogs listing that marks it as a unlicensed release, that has the companies name and and year they released their version of it, but that was not enough.

Him and his wife started screaming how I'm always not letting them talk, and I'm always just pretending to like things because I think they are rare and I want to be special, and how I just want the expsenive one because I want to be special, and that they are grown adults so they know more then me and that I was a idiot and a asshole for acting like I know more then them. They also said I wasn't actually into psychedelic rock and a lot more just calling me stupid.

I feel like it wasn't my fault, but I have a very warped perception due to this being a consistent day to day thing, They mocked me and called me names too when I tried to explain why a bootleg would end up wasting money.

One night, while I was preparing to go out to do some mushrooms with a friend, John asked me where I was headed. I told him, and we ended up discussing our past experiences with psychedelics. He then asked if I could bring him some back, but I hesitated, reminding him that they test for drugs in the military. He assured me it would be fine since it didn’t contain THC and handed me $30 for it.

After a few hours, I returned and gave him the mushrooms, advising him to do some research first. He was staying over in the living room that night.

About an hour later, my cousin knocked aggressively on my door. When I opened it, she was furious, demanding to know what I gave John. I explained the situation, and she yelled at me, calling me “dumb” and saying John was not having a good time after taking the mushrooms. I asked if I could check on him, but she told me to stay away, warning that I’d regret it if I approached him.

98,1flu6gq,AITA for refusing to speak to my pregnant SIL? ,"I 23F have a very poor relationship with my 29F pregnant SIL. 

She has been in the picture for about 6 years now, in those 6 years I’ve been around for all but 1 1/2 years. She married my step brother 28M, who’s been around basically my entire life. 

My SIL has hated me from day 1. I have absolutely no idea why and the only thing I even gotten close to an explanation is that she says I’m “proud”. I’ll give her this, I do however feel as though I’ve worked extremely hard to get where I am now. While she was an only child and given everything on a silver spoon, whereas I did not and struggled. HARD. So am I proud? Yea I am but I feel like I’ve eared a 🤏🏻 teeny bit of being the way I am. 

Just to give some examples of how she treats me: when we had family photos taken she didn’t pass along the dress code so I stuck out like a sore thumb while she matched all the women in the family, and I was cropped out of EVERY SINGLE photo that was posted by her. I wasn’t invited to their wedding, and actually caused her to have a fit when I was at the party weeks later to celebrate even though I had been used to set up the entire thing and didn’t even stay for festivities. I have a severe allergy and she puts this allergen in every dish she has ever brought to a family occasion and “forgets” to tell me it’s in the dish. She refuses to speak directly to me unless she’s cutting into a conversation to “correct me” even when she’s blatantly wrong and gets pissy when I call her on this, and she is sickly sweet to my boyfriend. 

She’s never even attempted to get to know me, and reacted HORRIBLY when she found out I knew she was pregnant- even though my step brother had Okay’d me knowing. She was absolutely livid and treated me, and my step mom poorly over this- and all I had done was try to privately tell her a heartfelt congratulations. 

Because of this, and years of trying to be nice I have hit a wall and decided I want nothing to do with her. I refuse to be in the same house or room as her, and I’ve asked my parents not to speak to me about her. My step mom is SO excited to finally be a grandma, but I feel like I have to set this boundary. My parents won’t stand up for me to her and have never intervened when she does anything to me. I personally feel like as the older person she should at least have the decency to have a conversation with me once to hash things out but I have never successfully been able to make this happen. 

AITA? I’m not ignorant and know I can’t cut off ALL contact without  destroying my relationship with my parents and forget about trying to stay away on holidays- I am perfectly capable of existing in proximity to her when absolutely necessary- but needless to say she will never be invited to my wedding or ever be allowed to have a relationship with my children someday.

99,1flu1ji,WIBTA if I tell my mom to stop getting mad at me because I don't like having her friend around our house?,"I (20F) live with my parents (45F and 50M) and my two younger siblings. Back in April, my maternal grandmother passed away from cancer (she lived with us, which is relevant to the story), and a little over two months ago, my parents brought a friend of theirs to live near us (he's also a member of their church). The initial plan was for him to stay for two weeks, but that didn't happen. 

This man is elderly, without any family, and doesn't live directly in our house but in a small apartment close to our property. At first, I didn’t mind his presence too much (since I’m a university student and spend most of my day out), but I wasn’t exactly thrilled about it either. It’s not that anything inappropriate has ever happened—I just never felt comfortable being around him. However, I understood that his companionship could help ease the loneliness my mother was facing after our recent loss, so I didn’t say much at the time, especially since he helps with various tasks around the property.

Now, I can barely tolerate him. I understand that his situation is sad—he’s older, has visual impairments and other health issues, and doesn’t have any family. But despite all of that, I just don’t like being around him. He’s intrusive and, due to his vision issues, tends to get physically closer to people than feels comfortable. Everything he touches, he brings right up to his face to inspect. He also inserts himself into conversations I’m having with my parents or siblings at the dinner table, offering his opinions. We take him along on nearly every family outing, and now there’s even talk of including him in our vacation plans. There’s also a conversation about him living with us *almost permanently.*

But what bothers me the most is his smell. When we go out in the car, I sit in the middle seat to avoid having my sister (who also doesn’t like him) sit next to him. I know he has good hygiene, but his body odor is so strong that it makes being near him unbearable. My parents are aware of this—I've had issues with people's scents in the past—yet I try to endure it to avoid causing any more problems. 

I don’t consider myself a bad daughter or sister, and I like to think (or hope) that I’m a good person. But every day my patience wears thinner. I’ve reached the point where I speak to him as little as possible, and I can’t even control the look of discomfort on my face when we sit at the table. I really don’t want to be rude or hurt his feelings, so I try to keep our interactions minimal. However, my mom, whether knowingly or not, sometimes shares things about me with him or asks me to join conversations that include him.

I understand how heartbreaking his situation is, and I know my parents are amazing for trying to help and include him in the family, but *he’s not my family,* and I’m at a loss for what to do.

100,1fltn7q,AITA for denying my birthday dinner?,"I would like to preface this story by saying money is not an issue here.

A couple weeks ago my mom invited me to dinner at her house for this Sunday. I said sure! It would be nice to catch up. 

Today she texted me saying that this dinner will be my birthday dinner. I said great! Can we go to my favorite restaurant like we usually do?

My mom said no, she’s cooking, remember?

Oh, okay. That’s alright. This will be the first time ever where I can’t pick my birthday dinner. It’s a family tradition but no biggie. I’m 25 and not a kid anymore.

I feel very ungrateful saying this but I was looking forward to my bday dinner because I’ve been struggling with an auto immune disorder and my mental health has been shit recently. My family knows this. 

So, oh well, I can go to my favorite restaurant with my partner instead another day.

Well, I found out my mom is doing an extravagant birthday dinner at a fancy italian restaurant for my step grandpa on Thursday and my older sister gets to pick out her birthday dinner on Tuesday (we all have birthdays very close to each other). 

I don’t know why I can’t choose where I want to go this year, especially when money is not an issue. 

No one can explain to me why we can’t go out to eat on my birthday other than “we had these plans already so let’s just make it your birthday dinner.” It makes me feel like my birthday was a second thought. If there was a legit reason then I would understand. And no, they definitely aren’t planning a “surprise” for me. 

I feel ungrateful because I know many people don’t get to celebrate their birthdays at all and they would kill for their mom to cook them a birthday meal.

This situation makes me feel lesser than and ungrateful at the same time and it’s very confusing.

I’ve always felt like the black sheep of the family. Not that I was neglected at all. I was actually spoiled but I felt pushed to the side a lot/being forgotten about. 

But I’m finally over it. I’m turning 25 and it needs to stop. 

I told my mom that we can have dinner on Sunday, but it won’t be my birthday dinner. We don’t have to celebrate my birthday this year either. (I do my own celebration with my partner anyways so it’s fine not to have a bday dinner with my family. Even though it makes me sad/feel like the odd one out). 

Now I’m labeled as the drama queen because I’m “refusing” a birthday celebration.

101,1fltddr,AITA? My father sold my concert tickets that I worked for and paid for,"I'm 16F. My father and I have never had a great relationship. Mainly because of how he speaks to my mother and how I call him out on it (disrespectful I know). I'm diagnosed with GAD and SAD and I'm getting tested for other things too soon. The past year or two I've struggled a lot with my mental health. I was bullied, went to homeschool, fell behind, and long story short I'm in online school and private school at the same time. Finishing out last year and starting my junior year. Going back has been fun but hard. It's stressful and I don't get any time to relax. I had had a few arguments with my mom and him because of my exhaustion throughout the week (I'll admit fault there). It was Thursday morning and my mother had to drop one of my sisters off sooner than me and the youngest, so she let us sleep in and said my dad would take us. Long story short he didn't want to get up year until he had to go to work, so she had to come all the way back to get us and go back out. I was a little frustrated with him but kept my mouth shut. That morning I was telling my mom I was feeling burnt out and I don't know if I can handle two loads of school at once. I came out of my room to get ready to leave, my father started yelling at me. He said ""college students take on way more. It's not hard. You're being lazy. You got yourself in this mess. You're a failure."" All I said back was that he was being so mean and putting me down. I cried and went into my room upset. That day he sold my Conan Gray concert tickets (the concert is in 5 days). Now if he had bought them I'd understand. But I worked for months to pay for mine and his ticket since I knew he wouldn't let me go alone and wouldn't pay for his. He had promised me months before to buy me tickets to Noah Kahan for my 16th birthday and didn't. So I knew if I wanted it I'd have to work for it myself.
Then he proceeded not to tell me, and when my mom did tell me he got angry with her. Saying she was trying to make him look bad in front of me like always. (They were arguing like always) Am I in the wrong? Keep in mind there is a whole backstory of lore in my family and his and my relationship, but I don't want to air all that out.
What should I do?

Btw when I say 2 full loads of school at one I mean I’m taking 16 classes right now. I have to do 7 hours in private school and come home to do about 2-5 assignments in 7 other classes. 


Edit: I feel like I need to clear some things up. He will pay me back the money when the tickets sell. Also I’m not completely innocent in this situation. I’ve fought with him many times before. I’ve called him a hypocrite, emotionally abusive, and a narcissist. Which isn’t something a respectful child says to their parents. So I understand his frustration with me. But that doesn’t mean my words aren’t true or that he had the right to take something away I worked for.

Update: my dad said if the tickets don’t sell that he’s not paying me back the 140 something dollars…

105,1fls97a,AITA for confronting my friend,"Hey! Long time reader, first time poster. My (16f) friend ”A” (16f) and I have been best friends since 3rd grade. We’ve gone through everything together. Sleepovers every weekend, she was the first person I told about my being a lesbian, I was the first to know about her dad breaking out of jail and threatening to (off) her, our moms became best friends. We were practically sisters. She’s very outgoing and strong. She can stand up for herself and isn’t afraid to voice her opinions. I, on the other hand, am the opposite. Keep this in mind.

I have always been very possessive of my friends since I don’t make many and am not too attractive. “A” on the other hand, is the definition of beauty (I might be a bit biased). Anyway, because of this, she has made friends with the popular crowd. Not the cheerleader type but the “always gossip, party, sm\*ke, dr\*nking“ crowd. I think part of this is her boyfriend who is the average white boy. I don’t always like him because he’s hurt her so many times and she’s taken him back. There is a lot I’m not sharing so don’t focus on him.

Anyway, onto the real problem. A few days ago, ”A” and I went out to the local shopping center. I’m very naive when it comes to “modern day slang” and phrases. So when she was talking about a “five finger deal” I just shrugged it off. Eventually, we got back in my car and she pulled out all of this makeup that she stole. I was surprised and she was confused. This was the first time I had ever seen her do this and she was acting like I was crazy. We then got dinner and she brought up an old mistake of mine I had made at a job. I was working around 5-7th graders on a musical and, when I thought I was alone, cursed to myself. Small curses but curses nonetheless. I was “let go” and I moved on. It wasn’t an official job so no paperwork or something to go on my resume. Just some side cash. Anyway, she was poking fun at the incident a little too much so I retorted, “I don’t think you should be judging me when you stole.” She got quiet and gave me this very passive aggressive attitude saying “why would you say that at my job? My boss is right there.” I made sure only she could hear me and her boss was across the room talking to newbies.

The car ride was awkward with me explaining that I had never seen this side of her before and she got very defensive.

I told him it’s not cool and to let him play at least one time to see if he bis good. My friend laughed and said “Why are you so offended? Are you gay too or what?”

First off I do understand why Maria was angry and I haven't hung out with Jane since. But it was a few weeks ago on the last weekend of summer. Jane invited me to hangout and talk about going back to school. I hadn't really done much and I hadn't been able to see my girlfriend due to her living 45 minutes away from my house, being busy and a plethora of other excuses. So I agreed we went to a nearby park where we talked about school and whether or not we were excited to go back. I texted Maria before I left that I was going on the walk and how long I'd be gone for. Nothing happened on the walk, I saw it as completely platonic. I came home and there was still no text (it had become regular for me to text her and she did not respond for hours even a day)       

 Then 10 minutes later BOOM, my phone blew up with messages, very clear she was hurt. At first I didn't even realise Maria was upset about me until she accused me of cheating. I was very hurt by this, she is my first partner and I had done my very best up to this point to avoid hurting her. I tried to explain that it was romantic and I had no interest in Jane. But she went on getting more emotional and claiming I had destroyed her trust. I did my best trying not to get angry or emotional myself and I tried to express how I didn't see it as cheating. She blocked me, and I had desperately tried to reach out to her for a few hours to plead my case and try to resolve the situation. I thought this was the end of our relationship and it saddened me deeply, but I sent her a farewell message and I wished her luck in life and that I was sorry I couldn't keep my promise on  going through life with her. I informed my mum what happened, who was adamant I did nothing wrong, she also claimed i was giving in to the relationship a lot more than i was getting out of it and tried to support me. Until 12 o'clock Maria texted me and claimed she had cooled off and gave me a chance to explain.         

We talked late into the night and Maria told me why what I did was wrong and how it looked to her. Me walking with a girl our age, one on one even if it wasn't romantic, was cheating to her. I apologised, we blamed it on my inexperience in Relationships and moved on. We slowly started to become more of a couple again and in the present day she is more involved in our relationship than before, calling me after school, being more attentive, we even stayed up late and worked on her important ELA project laughing and working through the night.        

I'm very happy with her, NO nasty comments about her. Say what you like about me but nothing about her.

We talked late into the night and Maria told me why what I did was wrong and how it looked to her. Me walking with a girl our age, one on one even if it wasn't romantic, was cheating to her. I apologised, we blamed it on my inexperience in Relationships and moved on. We slowly started to become more of a couple again and in the present day she is more involved in our relationship than before, calling me after school, being more attentive, we even stayed up late and worked on her important ELA project laughing and working through the night.        

I'm very happy with her, NO nasty comments about her. Say what you like about me but nothing about her. I'm simply asking if I was TA, because the thought of me potentially being a cheat has gnawed at me for many weeks. So kind off looking for closure i guess, thanks for your time and your judgement.",0.0,1.0291846990585327,1,0
112,1fmgaeo,AITA for how I act around my grandma ,"Context:
I was in my home country for 2 months and lived with my grandma and the rest of my family and I had to be the complete opposite of me( respectful, nice , talkative etc)

My grandma came back with us to the us and leaves in November and been staying with us 

Since I’m back home, I’ve been myself (quite,isolated etc) 

And told my family how she and the rest of my family are 

For 2 months I took shots from them about me and about my sisters, 

She called my my sister slow and dumb and how she won’t achieve anything 



I told them they would compare us to the favorite nieces and nephews and if you didn’t think like them they would ignore you

They judge our way of life and learned how my grandma called me and my sisters (dirty,lazy, can’t cook)

I knew the truth but I just let her talk cause I was under her roof 

So my sister asked me upfront why I don’t like my grandma

I told her my reasons 

But she said that its obvious I don’t like her and by the way I treat her 

How i went from talkative in my home country to quiet 

I responded that it’s a time and place , I was living with my grandmother so I had to be this proper person who would say good morning everyday and smile to everyone

Now I’m back to me being me 
a quiet person who doesn’t say good morning and all the focus is on me

Even tho I’m quite , if my grandma asks me for something I’ll responde or help cause to keep my house in harmony I have to respond 

My sister started to make me think I’m in the wrong

While I told her my reason and how I know what she said about us and know what she gonna say when she gets back

","So, I (26F) live with two roommates, and one of them, “Jess” (28F), has a bad habit of eating other people's food. At first, it was small things like a handful of chips or a piece of fruit, and I didn’t really care. But lately, she’s been eating entire meals I’ve prepped for the week, snacks, basically everything. I’ve confronted her multiple times, and she always apologizes, saying she’ll replace it, but she never does.

I’ve asked her to just respect what’s mine, and she’ll agree, but the next day, something else goes missing. It’s driving me insane because groceries are expensive, and I don’t want to budget extra just to feed her.

I finally got fed up and bought a small lock for the pantry I use and started keeping my dry goods and snacks in there. I also cleared out a section of the fridge for my food and labeled everything that’s mine. Since I installed the lock, Jess has been super passive-aggressive, saying I’m “treating her like a child” and making the house feel uncomfortable. She even made a sarcastic comment in front of friends about me “putting everything under lock and key.”

Now, the other roommate, “Sara,” says she understands why I’m frustrated, but she thinks I took it too far by locking up my food and creating tension in the house. I honestly don’t think I’m in the wrong here, but now I’m second-guessing myself.

114,1fmg5fz,AITA for not eating my girlfriends mothers very calories dense breakfast and dinners?,"For some personal context : 

I was previously overweight and have since lost 40 pounds. I had no understanding of calories prior to this and was overeating in mass. I now have a caloric deficit I try to match and it’s been going well. I’ve lost 40lbs.

Here’s the things. I recently moved in with my girlfriend and her parents. Reasoning is unnecessary. At the beginning I would eat whatever was cooked because I mistakenly assumed it was healthy and not extreme in calories. I noticed I was gaining weight and I wasn’t sure why. Then however after standing with her mother one night chatting while she was cooking dinner I realized. The amount of oil she uses is absolutely ludicrous. And her dinners that could be relatively 350-450 calories a serving quickly and easily become 850-1000 calories. 

Even when she makes breakfast every Sunday morning I realized just how much butter she uses for the pan and… again… it is ridiculous. Two eggs probably end up being 400 calories from butter alone. 

I feel rude not eating her dinners. And recently I’ve opted out but noticed she does get quite sad when I do so. I don’t know how to tell her that it just isn’t healthy. Once she made salad and but two entire bottle of caesar dressing in it. It was made to feed 4.
It wasn’t a huge bowl. 

I feel like a dick. She’s nice enough to cook everyone (and me, a new addition to the household) dinner every single night. I feel like  should just shut up and deal with it since I’m living under her roof but I’m not gonna just eat less in the day and starve while I’m at work so I can actually eat her food while maintaining my calorie deficit.
I’ve also had talks with her about calories and she said she has no idea how they work and she never even looks at nutrition labels. 
I don’t know what to do. And I feel even ruder if I turn down her dinner and make my own. And she’s in the living room all day so it isn’t like I can just wait until she’s sleeping (sometimes 1am) to make my own dinner.

I feel stuck.

My husband and I have two small chihuahua mix dogs that hide from all big dogs except Kojo. Kojo is a gentle giant that minds his own but my small dogs know he will protect them if needed. My family got Kojo when I was 19 years old. My mom, brother, and I would take Kojo to training lessons but I was the one putting all of the work in handling Kojo and teaching his commands.

My friends had been a bit annoyed when I told them Sam was coming, but none of them showed it towards him, Beth went out of her way to make him feel welcome, showing him how to read the map and pointing out bird species. He still gave one word answers and trailed behind, snapping at me when I asked if he was ok. I felt bad for him as I guessed my aunt had pressured him to go, but it was bringing the mood down for all of us.

We spent the night in a bothy (free mountain shelters in Scotland.) There were a couple of hikers already in there, we hit it off with them while cooking and shared alcohol around. We all started to have a much jollier time like we'd planned, and even Sam perked up a bit and me and Fergus managed to have a bit of a conversation with him about applying to universitiy. It didn't last though. Long story short, Sam had too much to drink and became an arse, tried to pick a fight with one of the other hikers over which bunk bed he wanted and then hit on Beth. She laughed it off, but we'd all had enough by then. We went to bed, including Sam, but not before he refused to help with any washing up and took a piss right outside the bothy door.

He was still asleep the next morning. I apologised for his behavior, and suggested we leave him to walk back on his own. We'd taken a long route the previous day, but the route today was simple, about 5 hours to the bus stop on a waymarked path following a river the whole way, which Beth had pointed out to him. Fergus and Beth agreed, so we left him with a map and sandwiches, then set off with the other 2 hikers. 

Sam didn't get home until after 10PM. He'd somehow set off in the wrong direction, and eventually been shown the right way by some other hikers, by the time he got to the bus stop he had to wait another 2 hours there as services are infrequent in the evenings.

My aunt is really mad at me and says I never should have abandoned an 18 year old inexperienced hiker hours away from the nearest village. IMO as hikes in Scotland go this was hardly the wilderness, it was an easy route back. You can get signal for most of it and there's enough people to ask for help. My parents are more sympthetic to me and blame my aunt for pressuring me to take Sam with us, but my dad says I should have 'grown up' and just ignored him on the way back. AITA?",Asshole,2024-09-21,"AITA for abandoning my cousin on a hiking trip? I (20M) had a hiking trip planned with 2 friends (Beth, 20F and Fergus, 21M) last week. My aunt and cousin (Sam, 18M) were visiting. The trip was only a night, so the family  didn't mind if I was gone for a couple of days. However, the day before the trip, my aunt asked if we could take my cousin with us.

122,1fmdgww,AITA for telling a failed love interest to move out after our mutual agreement ended?,"Hey everyone,

While living abroad I briefly met this girl and there was mutual interest shown. Fast forward a year from that point she moved to a country close to mine (I relocated back) to look for work. Things didn't work out for her and she was in a bad financial/personal situation. So I invited her to come stay with me, at my country for a **3 month stay** (Visa duration) to see if we clicked; and also in case that didn't work out to help her with a stable situation while she figured her future out .

Turns out we're not good for each other which we established after 2 weeks. Now we are approaching 2 months and I have been paying for everything, took her to vacations, invited her out with friends, family, etc. Part of our conversation was that even if things don't work out with us she still has 3 months money-free to try and find an alternative route in her life.

We're approaching the end of the 3 month period and while she has done little to improve her situation. a work offer (in my country of residence) came in which the papers she needs issued for could take an additional 3 months (if that is legit, nothing unexpected comes up is a different story).

She asked me to extend the free stay at my place for those additional 3? months but I've been extremely fatigued, spent a lot of money, don't get on that well with her - I told her that after the end of the initial 3 month period we agreed on she needs to leave the house. I feel bad because she is in a nasty financial situation but I can't take this cohabitation anymore.

123,1fmdcmt,AITA for not bringing her flowers and not paying for everything?,"Hi, so I met this girl on bumble about a week ago and so far we have been on a total of three dates. I really like her but recently she said some things that made me wonder if it's a good idea to pursue things any futher with her. For some quick context, I am a 26 M and she is a 21 F. Our first date was very nice, we went to a cafe, then an art exhibit, then finished off the night by grabbing some taco bell and eating in the car while chatting. She was really sweet and I had a great time (the art exhibit was free but I did pay for the food and drinks at the cafe and taco bell. I need to mention this because it to pertains to the story). I do not mind paying for the first date at all btw, but if we go dutch that's fine too. 

Our second date was also great, we walked around town looking at some shops and then grabbed some boba. That night we made plans for a picnic for a third date. I asked her if she could bring a picnic blanket because I did not own one. She said sure and told me to being flowers. I got confused because I've never had a girl ask me to bring her flowers before. We went back and forth for a bit on why I thought it was weird for her to ask me for flowers, and if I really liked her and thought that it would lead to something more, I would be more than happy to surprise her with some. She got really upset that I wouldn't bring her flowers and mentioned that if I didn't, then someone else would. The next day we ended up going on the picnic regardless. We stopped by a grocery store beforehand and grabbed some sushi. She paid for hers and I paid for mine. 

During the picnic I brought up the flower dilemma, she said she was upset I didn't want to bring her any flowers AND because I didn't pay for her sushi. She said she was used to guys always paying for her and that if we were gonna split the cost for everything then she would just rather go out with her friends. I mentioned that I paid for the first date and she said that it was just a cafe and taco bell- nothing extravagant. I then asked her if she wanted to keep seeing each other and she said she wasn't sure. I've never been on a date with a woman where money was the issue.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for not bringing her flowers and not paying for everything?

124,1fmcz96,AITA for yelling at my boyfriend? ,"My (35F) boyfriend (34m) and I have 2 toddlers. Today, one toddler fell off the couch and hit his head. I picked him up and he threw up all over himself, me, and the couch. I ask my boyfriend to help by taking the 2nd toddler since he was sitting right next to me. I get up to take the injured baby into the kitchen and start cleaning him up. My boyfriend sets the 2nd baby back down and goes to the kitchen to get paper towels so he can start cleaning the vomit mess. I look into the living room and my 2nd baby is playing in the vomit. I yell ""Babe, he's going to eat the vomit!"" My boyfriend gets irritated and yells that I need to stop yelling and that he won't be talked to that way. He proceeds to walk even slower to intervene on what the 2nd baby is doing. After getting the situation taken care I apologize for yelling but he thinks I'm 100% the AH here and controlling and he didn't do anything wrong. I tried to explain I was upset he put our baby right back where I didn't want him (where he can get to the mess). Am I the only AH here?

For those who are concerned about the baby! He's been cleared and is doing good. Thank you! I should have added that into the post! ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-21,"AITA for yelling at my boyfriend?
