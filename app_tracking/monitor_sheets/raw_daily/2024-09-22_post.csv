After I said that his sister was like he doesn’t know, it took me a second to understand and then it hit me. I was super embarrassed and felt like such an ass for spilling but I tried playing it off the best I could, he’s not even 12 yet so I’m hoping he just forgets I said it or doesn’t even understand what a groomsmen is lol.

1,1fn1ryz,AITA Girl pretending overdose ,"So I went to a friends’ house on Friday. Didn’t know his roommates would bring a bunch of folks over. I went to sleep when everyone went out for the night 

I woke up to a girl dramatizing an overdose, pretending that she was dying, she was crying profusely and shouting that she couldn’t breathe. I went over to her and asked what the problem was and if she was serious? The guys all told me to leave her alone and she was just being dramatic 

The day after, guy who I was supposed to hang alone with told me I “didn’t know the scene well enough” and that she was obviously faking it. I told him that wasn’t funny at all and maybe she has a personality disorder to be faking something like that so dramatically

He told me to never come over again and things were completely over between us. Fine with me, I don’t wanna be around drama like that. But he went on to call me a sociopath. 

Did I handle this in a wrong way? AITA? Wondering if I missed something or could learn from this.

2,1fn12gf,AITAH for making my sister wash the waffle ball?,"My sister (27f) made some waffles for herself yesterday. Today, after she had some mixture left, she suggested me (19f) and my other siblings to make ourselves some. 
I, used the mixture last, after all my other 4 siblings ate more than 2 servings. 
Then, my sister said the person who had last from the mixture ball should wash it. 
Me and my younger brother (18m) didn’t agree. Then her and my even older sister (29f) said I should wash it even tho I used it once and them ate multiple times just because I’m the one who put it in the sink. 
For some reason, we got into a fight and my sister said me and my lil brother are AHs and a couple of dummies 
It was kinda funny tho, and she suggested to ask objective people what they think. 
So, an I the ah? Or my sister should’ve just washed the ball.

4,1fn0umf,AITA for wanting my mom to apologize? ,"Throwaway account 

I'm in a bad bad time in my life which has me moved back in with my parents with my two small children. My parents are older and retired but have graciously opened their home to us and done so much to help out in many, many ways. 

My mom is a control freak (self admitted) and neat freak. We spoke about how this would be hard on her before we came cause I wanted everyone's eyes to be open. I'm trying to fit into her home and her rules (which aren't like too crazy or anything. Some things are a little intense to me, but whatever. Her house.)

The conflict has been that she's continually come into my room to clean. I'm not the neatest person but not a totally slob. Average I'd say but do get behind cause of the two small children. 

I've asked her repeatedly not to bother with my room, just leave it, I need a space where I don't have to feel the anxiety and pressure of trying to fit into her home and her rules. 

Thursday the cleaning lady came and she once again prepped my room for her. I begged her to please just stop and let me handle it. If I don't get it prepped enough, cleaning lady can just skip it and I'll vacuum it. She said ok and I thought we'd finally laid it to rest. 

Then this morning (Sunday) she came downstairs and met me know she'd installed extra shelves in the closet to better hold the kids linens. Which she had refolded and organized in said shelves. The way the linens had been was fine, I'd had no issues, hadn't complained. There was no problem to fix. 

I removed the shelves, returned the closet to how it was and texted her that I felt disrespected and like she was ignoring my boundary that she'd agreed too. I was assertive but not rude. I can post the screen grabs of the back and forth if it helps. She basically gave excuses that she was just trying to help and it was a nice thing. 

Later I asked for an apology and wanted to talk it out. She dug in and we got a bit heated.

So? AITA

I (21f) lived with my mom and sister . After my parents got divorced I got a burn out . My sister(20f) never supported me in this . She thought  it was not real and that I was just overreacting. I went to therapy and my dad moved out of the house . 

My sister can get very angry . She will scream and curse at people. She only does this with me and my mom . She did this as long as I can remember .  

My sister still yells and verbally scold people with the worst curse words you can think of . She will also say very hurtful things that destroy someones character . Afterwards she never apologises and just acts like nothing happened . 

When I was young I would always ignore it. I am at a point where my limit is reached . Talking to my sister does not work . She will not stop . I tried everything with her : conversations , fighting back , ignoring etc . 

I went to my mom to tell that this is not something I can keep up with anymore . I asked for family therapy but my mom “forgot “ 2 times to ask my sister. 

My mom says that me and my sister should solve this problem ourselves since we are adult and that my mom wants to stay neutral . I said to my mom that I feel like it is her responsibility to teach her child respect . My mom says that nothing works . 

My sister studies in another place and has her own room there . I told my mom that if my sister can’t be respectful to other people that maybe my mom should set some boundaries. 

My mom says she can’t do that to her child . I said that she can . That because my mom is not putting any boundaries in her house my sister scolds us both . My mom says she will stay neutral . I told her that in this case setting no boundaries means accepting that I get bullied by her . 

I have had this conversation multiple times with my mom . I have expressed I am very sad , hurt and disappointed and I feel like my mom is considering my sisters feelings more then me. 

Everytime we talk it ends up in emotional debate about who is wrong or right . I do not understand my mom and she doesn’t agree with my point . I tried everything with her . 

I decided to move out for some space and finally start my study . After years of the burnout I felt a little better but this situation makes me tired and doubt myself .

My mom is crying every time . She is very sad I left . I got mad and told her that this is something she could have prevented . She says she cannot change the way I think about her . I am getting very doubtful if I am seeing this wrong . And I feel very guilty for hurting her .

I told my closest friends, and they were cool with it, but I figured it was better for my peace of mind.

After the party, one of my friends mentioned that Jake was upset he wasn’t invited. He felt excluded and said it felt like I was excluding him from my inner circle, which really wasn’t my intention at all. Now, some friends are split on whether I should’ve invited him or if I was right to prioritize my comfort.

I didn’t want to make things awkward on my birthday or have any weird tension in front of my friends. I just wanted to enjoy my day without any drama.

Jake thinks I should’ve invited him, claiming that all our friends should be together and that I’m being petty for excluding him. He feels like he’s being forced out, which was never my goal.

I told my closest friends, and they were cool with it, but I figured it was better for my peace of mind.

After the party, one of my friends mentioned that Jake was upset he wasn’t invited. He felt excluded and said it felt like I was excluding him from my inner circle, which really wasn’t my intention at all. Now, some friends are split on whether I should’ve invited him or if I was right to prioritize my comfort.

I didn’t want to make things awkward on my birthday or have any weird tension in front of my friends. I just wanted to enjoy my day without any drama.

Jake thinks I should’ve invited him, claiming that all our friends should be together and that I’m being petty for excluding him. He feels like he’s being forced out, which was never my goal.

So, AITA for not inviting my ex-situationship to my birthday party? Should I have prioritized the group's dynamics over my comfort?",0.0,0.03678659,0,1

10,1fn05s5,AITA for not using my trust fund to save my best friend from homelessness?,"In my country, every kid automatically gets a trust fund from the government that they receive when they turn 18, and the amount depends on how much the parents contribute to it. Most people get around 1-2K.

My best friend received her trust fund back in April and got nearly £2000. She was really generous and decided to treat our entire friend group to dinner at an expensive restaurant. She also bought us multiple gifts, including giving me a paint brush set, a book, a ring, lip balm, and a scented candle. We all thought this was super sweet of her and we were extremely grateful.

A month later, I also received my trust fund on my 18th birthday. It turns out that my parents had saved up nearly £20,000. I knew they had been saving up money for me but I didn’t realise it was this much. I decided to learn from my friend’s actions, and I took everyone out for brunch, and I bought them each jewellery.

Not long after, my friend’s family went through financial troubles. My friend used what was remaining of her trust fund to help out her family, but it wasn’t enough. They’re currently facing eviction if they don’t pay the rent. My friend reached out to me last week asking me for help, begging me for over £100.

I feel bad but I refused. I’m going to Uni very soon and I need that money. Buying gifts is one thing, but paying her rent might make her dependant on me, and she might continue asking me for rent money because I agreed one time. My friend was really upset at me, calling me selfish. She said it’s not like I needed that much money since my parents would be paying for my Uni fees and accommodation fees, meanwhile she has to take out student loans and get two jobs. She has two younger siblings aged 6 and 10, and she called me stingy for allowing them to be homeless even though I have more than enough to help.

11,1fn03s3,AITA for calling my deadbeats wife arrogant and telling her to get over herself?,"My deadbeat father walked out on me and mom when I (17M) was 1. Never saw him again or heard from him again. He was arrested six times for failing to pay child support, mom never could get child support out of him (he was never officially working when she pursued it) and she eventually gave up before she died. I was 7. For the last ten years I lived with my three aunts (two bio aunts and one aunts wife).

In June I got a DM from some random woman claiming to be married to my deadbeat and saying they had kids together and she wanted me to be in their lives. I replied back that I wasn't interested and to please not contact me again. I blocked the account then too. A week later I got a DM from another account, saying she was the same person and asking me to reconsider. I made my account DM from friends only so she couldn't contact me that way again. She then made contact with one of my aunts, who told her to stop reaching out or she would be reported. But she wasn't giving up. She reached out to another aunt. Got told the same thing. Then she contacted one aunt at work. Then my aunt got a lawyer involved and sent a letter saying she needed to stop.

But that didn't end it either. We had to save all these attempts she made. And then she showed up at our house. She found the address on some website using info on my aunt. So I decided we needed to end this once and for all and I told her to leave it because I was not changing my mind. I told her I do not want to know her kids. That I'm sure they're fine and all but I have no interest in chasing blood relatives. She told me I'd regret not knowing all of them and how she could be the mother I don't have anymore. This is when I called her arrogant and told her to get over herself, that she's not that special and neither are they. I told her she has made me want even less to know any of them and I told her to enjoy the guy who ran so hard he ended up jailed for not paying.

My aunt called the police on her and as she was leaving she yelled that I didn't need to take such a shitty attitude toward them. That she was just trying to fight for the right for her kids to know their sibling so they have a better life than I did.

It's been almost a week and we're hoping that's the end of it.  I know people will wonder if my deadbeat reached out and the answer is no.

As time passed, S started distancing herself from me, focusing less on her studies and more on hanging out with them. She even ignored my advice and the warnings her mom gave her about these girls. Despite all this, I kept supporting her, even helping her through her exam stress when those girls abandoned her. She cried to me over the phone, and I was there for her.

But when I shared my plans to pursue a master's degree, S was negative and unsupportive, which made me question whether she ever truly valued our friendship. One day, I asked her directly if she even considered me a friend, but instead of giving me a straightforward answer, she gave excuses. That was the moment I decided to stop talking to her. It’s been months now, and she hasn’t reached out. I feel guilty for not being there for her, but at the same time, I just want her to accept her mistakes.

We had been pretty close when we were young but then our parents got divorced back when I was 15. We tried our best to keep in contact but we weren't that present in each other's life until I went to college (19). My father passed after a few years later (23), leaving me with all of his assets. Lily seemed happy for me and later tried to convince me to pay for her mother's medical bills, who was still going through her recovery process after getting into a car accident.

I refused because I didn't see a reason why I had to pay for her bills. Lily was earning enough to support herself while paying the medical bills and I hadn't met her mother in almost 10 years. I was going for a Masters/PhD and wanted to save the money to pay for my college fees and I did. Lily stormed out of my life, hoping I would die a painful death because of how heartless I was. She then went on to date my ex-boyfriend from high school, whom I couldn't care less about, by the way.

I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer the same year and it was already too late. I recently caught pneumonia. It's been a little over and year and I hate everything which is why I went through all the legal stuff and everything.

Edit: I'm aware euthanized is used for pets, normally but medically assisted death makes me feel too close to death so I'm going to with euthanized, now and forever.

18,1fmz5ej,AITA for embarrassing my family by talking about the things they said to me?,"I'm (16m) the baby of the family and I also have ADHD. Pretty bad ADHD too. Didn't get diagnosed until I was 11 though because my parents don't like diagnosis like that. They don't really believe in them. They also believe you just need to punish the inattentive hyperactive behavior out of kids like me. My siblings are 3-9 years older than me. None of them have any mental or behavioral health issues. They're like our parents for not being understanding too.

When I was younger I was in hell. I couldn't be still. I couldn't focus on shit. I could not keep track of time or things at all. No matter how hard I tried I was always failing or making people mad. And my family were the worst of all.

When I was 5 I got left behind at home while my parents went to the Christmas Fair. They didn't realize for an hour and came back. I'd moved around so much instead of going to the car because I was struggling to stay still or focused on the task. I was grounded for a week and had everything taken off of me. I ended up tearing up my room and got punished for a month with nothing and in that time I ended up so jittery and struggling. My parents just yelled at me and my siblings mocked me and yelled too for being weird.

Every time I got a report card my parents would bring my siblings for ramen (my favorite food) and make me watch everyone but me get some as a punishment for my bad grades.

One time I was running around the yard like crazy because I was so hyper. I was maybe 7. Two of my sisters called me a r-word slur and told me to go fucking die instead of making their friends see that.

The r word was used a lot toward me by my siblings.

My parents and siblings always said I'd never amount to anything and I was destined for prison or homelessness. My parents told me I couldn't even get good grades in kindergarten. 

My parents ignored many requests from the school to look into why I struggled. It took until this amazing teacher when I was 11, who annoyed my parents so much they gave in and got me evaluated. ADHD diagnosis happened immediately. I was one of the worst cases. They said no to meds. Had to talk to a hospital social worker and changed their minds. The initial meds process was rough and they were shitty to me even then. Saying meds couldn't even fix me. I still talk to that teacher! She's amazing. My favorite teacher in the world. Love her!

I've been back to in person school for two years and my grades have improved a lot because of a program my school runs. I'm now getting Bs and Cs instead of D- and Fs. My best friends family took me out to celebrate and during that we talked about my family and I told them everything. None of them expected it to be that bad. Maybe a little unsupportive but not to that level. They shamed my parents for it  afterward and my parents were furious that I talked about it. They said I went out of my way to embarrass the whole family.

Didn't get diagnosed until I was 11 though because my parents don't like diagnosis like that. They don't really believe in them. They also believe you just need to punish the inattentive hyperactive behavior out of kids like me. My siblings are 3-9 years older than me. None of them have any mental or behavioral health issues. They're like our parents for not being understanding too.

When I was younger I was in hell. I couldn't be still. I couldn't focus on shit. I could not keep track of time or things at all. No matter how hard I tried I was always failing or making people mad. And my family were the worst of all.

When I was 5 I got left behind at home while my parents went to the Christmas Fair. They didn't realize for an hour and came back. I'd moved around so much instead of going to the car because I was struggling to stay still or focused on the task. I was grounded for a week and had everything taken off of me. I ended up tearing up my room and got punished for a month with nothing and in that time I ended up so jittery and struggling. My parents just yelled at me and my siblings mocked me and yelled too for being weird.

Every time I got a report card my parents would bring my siblings for ramen (my favorite food) and make me watch everyone but me get some as a punishment for my bad grades.

One time I was running around the yard like crazy because I was so hyper. I was maybe 7. Two of my sisters called me a r-word slur and told me to go fucking die instead of making their friends see that.

The r word was used a lot toward me by my siblings.

My parents and siblings always said I'd never amount to anything and I was destined for prison or homelessness. My parents told me I couldn't even get good grades in kindergarten. 

My parents ignored many requests from the school to look into why I struggled. It took until this amazing teacher when I was 11, who annoyed my parents so much they gave in and got me evaluated. ADHD diagnosis happened immediately. I was one of the worst cases. They said no to meds. Had to talk to a hospital social worker and changed their minds. The initial meds process was rough and they were shitty to me even then. Saying meds couldn't even fix me. I still talk to that teacher! She's amazing. My favorite teacher in the world. Love her!

I've been back to in person school for two years and my grades have improved a lot because of a program my school runs. I'm now getting Bs and Cs instead of D- and Fs. My best friends family took me out to celebrate and during that we talked about my family and I told them everything. None of them expected it to be that bad. Maybe a little unsupportive but not to that level. They shamed my parents for it  afterward and my parents were furious that I talked about it. They said I went out of my way to embarrass the whole family.

19,1fmyr70,AITA for making a self deprecating joke everytime someone calls me smart?,"I'm (23F) a senior at my state university in chemical physics and chemistry. I live in the university town so college and degrees are a common topic; it's not unusual to meet someone and one of the first questions be ""do you go to state university?"" followed by ""What's your major?"". In my case, after telling someone my major I always get some comment about my intelligence along the lines of ""you must be really smart"" or some variation of that. It's always made me VERY uncomfortable, I never know how exactly to respond and anyone who's known me longer than a day knows I can be the biggest dumbass this side of the Mississippi. So to counteract that awkwardness and keep the conversation moving I've always made a joke along the lines of ""not usually"" or ""I wouldn't go that far"" and then ask them a question about themselves. My logic is I acknowledged their compliment and kept the conversation chugging along.

However, I went out with a friend, Sam (NB 20), to a local store near campus. While checking out Sam and I had some small talk with the cashier and the topic of the state university and majors came up and when it was my turn to share I got the same response about my intelligence and I in return made one of my usually jokes. On the way home Sam asked why I made that joke because it made the conversation awkward and uncomfortable. I explained that I usually get comments about my intelligence and it makes me uncomfortable so I try and make a light hearted joke and steer the conversation away. Sam said that instead I should express my discomfort or just not bring up my major if I know my intelligence is gonna be brought up. I felt like bringing up my discomfort everytime someone brings up intelligence would make the conversation more awkward and I felt like not bringing up my major or lying about it would either do the same or make it appear as if I'm ashamed of my major.

Upon starting an apprenticeship last year, my parents and I agreed that I should pay rent. I currently pay £200 a month and my salary has been £15000 a year. The £200 was agreed on by my parents as a fair price for one room in the house and dinners being cooked for me some nights. My mum originally wanted it to be £300 but my dad thought this was unfair. Recently, due to complications in my apprenticeship, I had to move jobs which has ended up increasing my salary to £22000. Also, one of my parents decided to quit their job but not take their pension yet, despite being old enough to. 

This week, I was sat down by my parents and they said they wanted to start charging me £400 a month as this was 25% of my new salary. They explained it wasn’t because their combined income would decrease, however it seems too much like a coincidence. They tried to say it was to teach me a lesson about saving, but I have saved my whole life, and since working have opened savings accounts for a deposit on a house and for my first car. I have since bought my first car with my own money and had enough money spare to pay the insurance because I saved almost everything I earned. When I said this to them they took it back and said I was right but didn’t offer an alternative reason to increase my rent. 

I would be happy to pay the £300 they wanted previously as it seems fair to me but I don’t understand why it’s now gone up another £100.

She loves social media a lot and uses her smartphone so I do feel bad she wants her iphone back so she can chat with friends and wants to go get it back we could technically go and come back but it would cost so much money it would be cheaper to buy a brand new iphone my daughter wanted that then but I simply refused I wasn't buying her a phone she'll only need for a week because she forgot and told her to suck it up.

AITA for not helping my daughter and telling her to suck it up

I've been planning to go on a vacation with my kids to see my sister in western europe we have a holiday right now so we decided to go for a week.

My oldest daughter 14f forgot her phone as we left to the airport she didn't notice until we were at the airport when it was too late to go back she started to cry and was tense throughout the flight. My mother confirmed the phone was at our house

When I arrived my niece who's 19 gave my daughter her old flip phone and set it up for her so she could atleast call but she's upset she doesn't have a smartphone or social media.

She loves social media a lot and uses her smartphone so I do feel bad she wants her iphone back so she can chat with friends and wants to go get it back we could technically go and come back but it would cost so much money it would be cheaper to buy a brand new iphone my daughter wanted that then but I simply refused I wasn't buying her a phone she'll only need for a week because she forgot and told her to suck it up.

Maybe I was rude but she started to throw a tantrum and panic after she reached there eventually she calmed down but she still wants to go back.

I have a 7yo half brother Avery. My dad has always had full custody.

I told Avery he's a second grade kid and should sleep on his own. Sometimes he'll even ask to shower with my dad too. 

My dad told me where Avery sleeps or showers or eats is none of my business and I'm the brother not the dad. I told my dad you're just spoiling him and if Avery is moving into your room then I should take his room. Avery doesn't use it and even though I go to college I would use it more than him.

I had been told engineering is a sausage fest and honestly i was kind of surprised because there are more girls than I expected. More plan to select the computer engineering specialization than electrical though. Still less than dudes.

I noticed that about half of them are the high maintainance type, always showing up with makeup well done, nails done etc and half are the opposite and show up in a hoodie and jeans.

I mentioned to my gf in conversation who is more of the latter type that im ready to bet the pretty high maintainance ones will drop out by 3rd year or adapt and not have the time to do their makeup before class. I have talked to seniors who said the program is very challenging.

However my gf got upset at me because she said she was actually thinking of changing her style a bit and putting more effort in how she dresses to school. She does dress up but not usually for class.

32,1fmuzfa,AITA for threatening to kick my mom out of the house?,"I(32F) live in the house I grew up in. When my mom(53) married her 2nd husband(55) she moved out, leaving the place to me. I gave her my inheritance and savings. It didn’t cover the full value, but I didn’t want it for free. I’m grateful for this because I wouldn’t have been able to buy a house otherwise.

 

My relationship with her has always been troubled, but it has improved after she moved out, so I agreed to let her and her husband temporarily move back in when they started building a new house. They already sold the previous one, and renting would've been too expensive.

 

Things were going fine for a while, but then my mom started taking over the house. She moved everything in the kitchen because it was 'more logical'. She’s switched out rugs, artwork and decorations because it’s 'more aesthetic' that way. She rearranged and threw out furniture, etc. I’ve asked her a million times to talk to me before doing something like this, but to no avail. She also has trouble sleeping and often watches TV until 2 am. I have to get up at 6 on weekdays, so it’s really messing with my sleep. I gave her my headphones, but she says the TV isn’t loud, I’m just sensitive, so I should get earplugs like her husband. It's true, I get overstimulated easily, but I don’t think it’s unreasonable to ask her not to watch TV at 75% volume at 2.

 

But the worst is her backhanded remarks. If I don’t like the new artwork, I have no taste. If I complain that I have to mop the bathroom after every shower because her new bathmat doesn’t absorb any water, I’m lazy. I break a mug, I’m miserable. I try to set boundaries, I’m ungrateful or weak. I disagree with her, I’m dumb or spiteful.

 

Yesterday I could’ve slept in, but I woke up to her vacuuming before 8. I snapped. I confronted her about everything—from childhood traumas to her recent behavior. Her response was, ""You're just like your father,"" with so much disgust on her face that I'd never seen before. I was on the verge of tears, and told her that if she can’t change her behavior, she’d better pack her things and leave for good. Then I left for a friend’s house.

 

I had time to think and I called my stepdad. It’s important that I was diagnosed with C-PTSD 3 years ago. I go to therapy, but sometimes small things can still trigger me, and I overreact. My stepdad said that happened in this situation. I overreacted when I should’ve been more empathetic because it’s tough for my mom too. Also, it was her house before she let me have it, so my rules are humiliating for her. 

 

When I calm down, I can mostly tell whether my anger was justified or if it was my C-PTSD. This time I felt like I had good reasons to be mad, but my stepdad made me question my judgment. Ever since my mom moved back in, I’ve been spiraling mentally, and now I don’t even know how much I can trust myself when it comes to these things.

We got a 16 year old Swedish girl that I will call Sara and that has worked very good, she’s very open and honest and loves to share how things are in Sweden how different things are here in the US. It was her birthday just a few days ago so we gathered around the laptop while she was face-timing her family and they started singing in Swedish but the song was particularly longer and more repetitive so after the call I asked her about it and she explained that some families in Sweden sing a song where they talk about shooting, hanging and drowning the birthday person after they turn a 100

My wife overheard this and started to get annoyed because in her words “it was inappropriate and extremely disrespectful to her household” when she sang that without her knowing. 
My wife isn’t naturally sensitive to bad language or words but when she was born she had a 60 year old dad that died when he was 96 so she is more conscious about how elderly people can feel just before they are about to die and she felt like the song was making fun of people when they are old and sick. 

Me and the twins were embarrassed while standing there so I asked her to calm down and that it’s just a Swedish joke song that isn’t even meant in that way but she just started ranting about it was her house to and she shouldn’t be afflicted to such derogatory language behind her back. Sarah obviously felt bad tried to apologize and that she didn’t mean to be disrespectful in that way and that it was just her family singing the song but my wife just stormed out and yelled how she couldn’t believe we had taken in a girl from such a cruel family.

My wife was apparently more upset at me for not supporting and agreeing with her and started to cry about how I knew what she had gone through concerning her father but didn’t back her up.

I have read all of the comments , I was even up late at night to read them all and I’m very thankful that so many people gave there input on my situation , I first talked to my wife this morning and showed her SOME of the comments after last night . At first she was pissed I wrote out our personal information but I explained that I didn’t write anything that could trace back to us and she calmed down. I first want to mention that no my wife is not jealous of Sara in that way and I’m not attracted to Sara since some comments said that. And also my wife is not pychotic or narcissistic. I agree it was horrible way to treat a guest and we have already talked to our organization and they are currently looking for a new host family for Sarah. 

My wife is still upset but is starting to feel incredibly guilty and has apologized but I understand that no amount of sorry will make Sarah feel safe again. Tensions are still high but I showed Sarah some of the comments and she finds it hilarious and comforting and I again assured Sarah that she didn’t do anything wrong and dark children’s songs are in every culture and doesent harm anyone. And to answer some other questions no my wife doesent usually do this and she was starting to panic when I talked to her about what she actually said and how Sarah probably feel being trapped in our house in a foreign country. I also showed her the true meaning of the song by one of the comments which caused her to almost have a panic attack that I needed to guide her through.

We will investigate this further since I know some of you had theories about how it could be menopaus so we will look into that.

Again thank you for for the advice on how to face this but I want to mention that a lot of people assumed a lot of horrible things about my wife and I wanted to clear that up

36,1fmts4f,AITA for raising my phone till my eye height for checking my makeup in a tram?,"
I (20F) just came back from a trip to place with jacuzzi and a sauna, this was my 2nd time wearing makeup this long without a team or touch up tools, and I did not bring a proper mirror, for me to check my full face. 

The makeup has been on since 10:30am and I wanted to check so badly because my friend said my makeup was good that it still stayed on my face for this long before we parted ways but I could not because of bad lighting, and the night, where everywhere was not really well lit. It was already around 8:15pm.

So I decided to check when I got in the tram to get home, where I  remembered what my friend said and waited till there was no one around me, left and right where there was just empty seats, but a few more people, about 9 feet away from the front of me, before holding out my phone for a real check in landscape, I wanted to see how it looked on my acne sacred face to see if it really did hold on to its coverage and if my lashes I stuck was still in place but I might have held it for around 10 seconds long and tried to pinch in and turned my face into the frame from the screen.

Then, a lady, who I didn’t see properly because my contacts weren’t for the night vision type, called out, “Excuse me, Excuse me!! Are you taking a photo of me or yourself?!” I was confused because I couldn’t see well where that sound was coming from, I had one ear with earphones, then I looked around to see a lady sitting diagonally across me, 3 rows away with the space of the opening doors in between. 

“Me? (Pointed to myself) Me. I’m taking photos of myself. My lashes. I’m just checking my lashes.” She continued with,“No, no, no! The way you’re holding your phone, you looked like you’re taking photos of me! Because of the way you’re holding the camera.”

ATP, I said, “Ah, okay.”and lowered my phone to the double chin angle but still in landscape to check my lashes, which was not what I wanted because the lighting was all gone this way and I really wanted to take a nice picture too before taking it all off. But she was still going on, “You’re not supposed to take pictures of other people, you have to think about how you’re holding the camera towards other people. You’re invading other people’s privacy. You need to ask permission and I didn’t give you that.” 

I was already giving no response to her when I lowered my phone but still heard what she said and went scrolling through vids when she kept on going telling me that I wasn’t supposed to hold it that high and with that angle. She was still angry, I guess, so she moved all her stuff to sit infront of me in the seat that was facing in the opposite direction of where I was looking so I was staring at her back.

Was I really the butthole in this situation for holding my phone in that angle and height? Did I do the wrong thing for not waiting till I got home to check my makeup?

37,1fmtelc,AITA for telling my dad I'll stop talking in therapy if he changes therapists?,"I'm (15m) in therapy with my dad (43). We started going back in April and it's been okay, I guess. I got some stuff off my chest and dad did too. We made some progress but my dad isn't liking the progress and he doesn't like the therapist anymore.

The reason we're in therapy is our stepfamily. Dad doesn't like how I handled becoming one and he doesn't like that I'm not open to being a more TV style perfect family. Kinda like Hallmark. He wants us to be like we're a regular bio family and he doesn't like that it's different for me and that I treat his wife like a family member but not a parent or that I don't see my step and half siblings as just siblings but I see them as steps and halfs. And after 5 years of him being married he wanted to fix stuff.

The reasons for therapy: 1) The fact I won't invite his wife to do Mother's Day things with me and the fact I try to get out of celebrating with her on Mother's Day every year. I know she's a mom. But she's not mine. I'm a member of the dead mom's club so for me Mother's Day is weird but also I don't like the idea of celebrating his wife like she's my mom. 2) That if I'm asked to write in my parents names I'll typically only write his. If it's for something where it's not about contacting someone I'll put him and mom down. 3) I don't go to his wife for stuff the way I will for him. I'll spend time with her without complaining and I will help her out if she asks. But if I want a parents advice or whatever I go to him and never her. 4) I don't ever just say my step and half siblings are my siblings. I'll tell people I have step and half siblings. 5) I'm not super close to my step and half siblings. We get along fine. But he said I used to really want a sibling when I was younger and now I have them and don't do the stuff I used to say I would. 6) I didn't want a photo the stepfamily added to the last page of my ""childhood years"" book that I get when I turn 18.

Dad said in therapy he wants and feels it's best if I accept the stepfamily as just family and let his wife be another parent in my life. Not just a family member. The therapist has told him that it's okay to want things to be a certain way but he has to understand he can't force it. She asked me if there were any compromises I'd be willing to make. I said I wouldn't complain about Mother's Day if I just joined them for breakfast and was then excused. My dad has really disliked being told he can want but can't force something. He pushes back on the therapist a lot with that and refuses solo sessions. Now he told me he feels we should find a better therapist. I don't want that and I told him. I said he doesn't get to find someone who'll just agree with everything he says. He told me we can't fix things with this therapist. I told him I won't talk anymore if he changes therapists. He told me therapy only works if we try. I said I know. He told me to be less petulant about this.

Im really curious if Im the Asshole. Quick backstory, my grandma is from ukraine and ive lived w her for arround 3 years, we had a quite good relationship, she has a strong character and is very outgoing. She was very strict w my mother and so they dont really have a great relationship, as the war started she came to us in germany, and from that point everything started to go down. Everything needs to be exactly as she wants it, and if not she will yell and scream for “how we are treating” her. She is bored here and didnt want to learn the language or do a drivers license, so she just sits the whole day inside and complains about everything. Obvi i do have understanding for her situation but on the other side i find it difficult to be that ungrateful for everything. About 3 years ago she told my mother a lot of stuff that was ABSOLUTELY not true… Bc she was bored and didnt had to do anything else, at that time i had a really bad relationship w my mother, so she believed everything what my grandma said. This ended up in me being in the psych ward. (didnt got an apology still)
Grandma really knows how to f up peoples lives, right now is my mother her victim. My grandma doesnt know that i know it, but she cheated on my dead grandpa for about 20 years, she talks still with this guy and says “its a friend of hers”, I was furious when my mother told me this. But i kept quite. She will never know that I know. 
Last year my grandmother wanted to do a trip w me bc she wanted to travel, I was very suprised and nervous bc as u can see shes a difficult person. 
I still agreed bc this was probably her last time traveling. The trip was better than i expected but still extremely stressful. Ive been in paris before and could navigate quite good, but everything i said or did didnt suit her. One time we went trough the champs elyssee and she wanted to go back to the hotel, than i said her i know how to get there, she didnt believed me and just ran fking away from me, i followed her for about 40 minutes through the whole ass city. Then she started screaming at me that i was so dumb etc. I was really pissed. 
But the current situation is, I want to take a solotrip to probably sweden, and she wants to come w me.

40,1fmszb6,AITA for hanging out with my friends and not inviting a girl I barely know?,"So, me and my two close friends, Emily and Grace (all early 20s, F), have been hanging out for years. We’re super close and regularly do fun things together. Recently, Emily started bringing along another girl, Jenna, who’s close with her and friends with Grace, but I barely know her. I’ve met Jenna a few times but didn’t mind her joining us.

Now, me, Emily, and Grace have been talking for a year about playing Padel, which requires four players. Since Jenna was visiting, Emily added her to our group chat without asking and invited her as the fourth player. I was fine with it and booked the court for a week later.

But leading up to the day, Jenna kept making excuses not to come. One day she’d question why we were even playing, and the next, she’d say she didn’t have clothes. I kept reminding her to pay her part since Padel is expensive and each person pays separately. Finally, the night before, after days of reminding her, she said she had a fight with her family and wouldn’t come.

This last-minute cancellation meant we couldn’t play without a fourth person so we had to cancel the whole thing. Since it was clear Jenna didn’t want to play, I suggested we invite our other friend, Sarah, who had just returned from abroad. We booked the court for next Saturday at 8 am and planned to have breakfast afterward.

The night before our booking, Emily hung out with Jenna and mentioned our plans. Jenna seemed fine at first but later posted on social media about how depressed she was, calling us “disrespectful bitches” for not considering her. She didn’t even know me well, yet she was trash-talking me to mutual friends, claiming Grace and I were horrible and inconsiderate.

She said she wouldn’t have even gone because who wakes up early for sports on saturay. I found it confusing since I barely know her, and she was acting irrationally. Jenna claimed she never wanted to see me again and accused us of disrespecting her on purpose.

I got screenshots of her subtweeting us, posting over 25 tweets, calling us horrible people and praying for God to “deal with us.” Honestly, I don’t care if she hates me—we’re not friends. The original plan was for us to play with Sarah. It seems childish; not every hangout needs to include everyone.

So, AITA for going to play Padel with my friends and not inviting Jenna when she was already flaky?


Edit: incase it wasn’t clear when jenna cancelled we rescheduled it to the next week, we didn’t go the same day so she was mad why we didn’t ask her again.

41,1fmsufo,AITA for talking bad about my roommate?,"I \[F20\] am a student in her final year at university. At the beginning of this year, me and two friends \[M20\] and \[M20\] decided to get a student house together. A friend of ours, Nat \[20\], asked to live with us as well, which works fine as we needed a fourth for our house. All four of us share a group chat, where me and M1 and M2 would routinely discuss the house over summer. Fast forward to two weeks ago, after myself, M1, and M2 had been working all summer to save up for the rent and deposit needed for our house. I live 6 hours away from the house, so I was packing my car ready to make the drive early the next morning. Before we could collect our keys, we each had to pay a months rent and the remaining deposit for the house. No issue for any of us, except for Nat. Nat had been overseas in the US for the past two weeks, and had said little regarding the house, despite myself and the others routinely checking in with them about the approximate cost and required forms etc. As I confirm in the group chat that the three of us have sent off our rent and deposit, Nat says that they do not have the money. 

Obviously, this made me panic, as in about six hours I was set to drive up and move in. This payment was something we had discussed at length, both in text, and over voice calls. I, myself, had even had a conversation 1 on 1 with Nat explaining the costs and requirements, to which they said they understood. As we all rushed to find a solution, I offered to pay the remaining rent and deposit. Doing so would put me in debt, but after hours of discussion, Nat had not proposed any solution, so it seemed the only option. For context, myself and my family are pretty lower class, so a sum of £800 isn't exactly something I can throw around casually. Nat was not immediately thankful of this, instead repeating how they felt they had screwed up and let us all down, and in fact wouldn't thank me personally at all. As stressed as I was, I remained casual with Nat, while politely emphasising that they would have to pay me back. Over the moving in period, Nat began trying to barter about which room in the house they would get, and how they should pay less rent due to the differing room sizes. At this point, Nat had still not paid any amount of money towards the house.

To vent my frustrations about losing £800 that i had worked hard for, I told some friends about the situation, as I felt perhaps my anger towards them was misplaced. While my friends tell me that I am okay for feeling angry and upset, I still feel like i'm perhaps being too cruel. I've remained polite and friendly with Nat since they've moved in, never bringing up the issue with them 1 on 1 as to not stress them out.

42,1fmslmm,AITA: My boyfriend’s best friend’s girlfriend crosses subtle boundaries with me,"I’ve been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a year, and his best friend (24M) has a girlfriend (24F) they've dated for 5 years. Initially, I found her fun, but the second time we met, she started making weird comments about my boyfriend, like how he's stuck at a ""miserable job"" or how he’s ""afraid"" of her and always seeks her approval. She also said my boyfriend was ""easily influenced"" by her and that she controls who he invites to hangouts.

Later, she invited me and my boyfriend out, making it sound like it would be a small gathering. When we arrived, she had brought six of her friends without telling us, leaving me feeling awkward and out of place. She kept bringing up my boyfriend and our relationship in conversation, which made me uncomfortable, especially when she compared our relationship to how he acted with his ex.

When I told my boyfriend about how uncomfortable I felt, he said I should either confront her myself or stay home next time.

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-22,"AITA: My boyfriend’s best friend’s girlfriend crosses subtle boundaries with me I’ve been dating my boyfriend (24M) for a year, and his best friend (24M) has a girlfriend (24F) they've dated for 5 years. Initially, I found her fun, but the second time we met, she started making weird comments about my boyfriend, like how he's stuck at a ""miserable job"" or how he’s ""afraid"" of her and always seeks her approval. She also said my boyfriend was ""easily influenced"" by her and that she controls who he invites to hangouts.

Later, she invited me and my boyfriend out, making it sound like it would be a small gathering. When we arrived, she had brought six of her friends without telling us, leaving me feeling awkward and out of place. She kept bringing up my boyfriend and our relationship in conversation, which made me uncomfortable, especially when she compared our relationship to how he acted with his ex.

When I told my boyfriend about how uncomfortable I felt, he said I should either confront her myself or stay home next time. He doesn't see her behavior as an issue and believes it wouldn't reflect on him if I confronted her. He also said if her being around makes his best friend happy, he won't ask her to stay behind.

So, here it is, I feel a lot of guilt about this and I know that my mom would feel bad if she knew that.

I (F23) have a brother (40y). I don't have much memories with him when I was a kid, even no memories.
He got sick when I was 3yo. He developped a schizophrenic disorder triggered in particular by drugs. So, he was hospitalized very soon because the consequences were heavy. 

The first memory I have with him is me and my mom visiting him at the clinic and I was around 8yo. Before that, I don't remember anything. I just know some anecdotes that I was told and how much my brother was taking care of me when I was a baby. But, no memories of that.

Since, I just visit him approximately once a month at the clinic with my mom. And now, it’s been a year I didn’t see him. But I don't feel the need or the desire to see him. I tried to create a relationship but he's so closed and off the world. He is way better than the beginning but still difficult to reach him. I have this feeling that I can't create a relation sister/brother nowadays. I feel that I don't know him.

My mom is worried that nobody will take care of him when she'll be gone. I have a sister (34yo). She never goes see him (even tho she shared a lot moments with him, they were very close, due to their close ages) because she is mad at him for being sick.
I said to my mom that I will, because I care of him anyway but she can’t expect from me that I will build a real relationship.

I know he is sick, it's not his fault and I don't blame him, I just feel that it's too late to create anything, having already tried.

46,1fmrmtc,WIBTA for Raising a Puppy?,"Recently, my parents agreed to raise a puppy with me for a guide dog organization. If you're unfamiliar, this means that we would take in a puppy, keep it for a year, and give it back. It would then train to be a guide dog at their facilities and hopefully become a guide dog.

For some context, my older brother ""Kyle"" just entered college as a freshman. Kyle was very distant from me and our parents when he lived with us. Now, he attends an out-of-state college and hasn't come home at all since he left in August. I still live with my parents and do my best to be helpful around the house.

The way our schedule has worked out recently means that we won't get the pup until June. Kyle is also planning to come home for the summer at this point, and he would also be coming home around June.

My parents called my brother a few weeks ago and told him that we were going to be raising a puppy. They had him on speaker phone and I was nearby, so I heard him go, ""ugh, really? Why?""

He texted me later asking if it was my idea, and I said yes. Kyle then said I shouldn't have done it and that he didn't want to ""deal with"" the puppy during his break from school. I reminded him that he doesn't live here anymore, it's not his choice to make, and he will probably end up spending most of his time at work or friend's houses. I also tried to explain to him that the puppy wouldn't be his responsibility, as I will also be off from school and be able to watch the puppy full-time. Kyle then said that since he's allergic to dogs (he is, but his allergy isn't deadly, and can be mostly helped by Zyrtec) this was a really shitty move. I explained that me and my parents talked about this a lot and were already doing the classes despite the fact that my dad is also allergic, and that if he wanted things to change, it was a bit late.

When I say out of control I mean literally, they jump all over you as soon as you walk in the door to the minute you leave. They jump on the back of the sofas so they can jump on your shoulders and on your head etc, last year my husband had a hot cup of tea in his hand and they jumped on his back when he was sat down and the hot tea spilt all over him. One of them urinates all over you when he becomes over excited. 

They jumped on me when I was pregnant and nearly landed on my stomach, they are big heavy dogs and could have caused serious injury! Luckily my husband managed to grab them just in time!
She has absolutely no control over either of them and she doesn't seem to care.

Here is where my issue is, my husband and I had a baby 4 months ago and we have refused to take our baby round there because of her wild dogs. When I was pregnant, MIL said the dogs will love the baby because 'she will be a new toy for them to play with'. None of the family seem to understand this and keep badgering us about taking the baby round to her house. 

My SIL keeps trying to guilt trip us by saying how MIL misses her Granddaughter and is desperate to see her, MIL can drive and has a car and we live 5 minutes away. We have always said she is welcome to come to our house to see us and the baby whenever she wants! My husband is in agreement with me and is constantly arguing back with them.
Their argument is that the dogs are really friendly and not at all vicious however that is not the point.

They are out of control and I am not prepared to risk taking my baby in a house where she could be jumped on and pee'd on by two big dogs. AITA?

Thank you for all your comments! I feel so much better about it now, I’ve been feeling so anxious about it!

I know she’s quite sad you might not be able to make it and if she see you going out and stuff might assume that you could’ve used that money to see her x” this just seemed extremely insensitive to me as i can go out to the club with a few pound for the train back in the morning and have a good time, i felt really conflicted on what to reply because i know where she’s coming from but at the same time it wasn’t really any of her business what i decide to spend my money on. 

i get paid £260 a month and after bills and rent i am left with £83 for the rest of the month…i explained this to A saying how she can’t expect me to spend £45 on a train ticket to london and then spend another £50 on food etc especially considering her birthday is right at the start of october id be left with nothing for the rest of the month and i have to buy all of my own food, i am quite literally living pay check to pay check atm and it just doesn’t seem fair she’s trying to guilt me into spending all my money to go to london for 2 days when she didn’t even bother to turn up to my birthday. sorry for the word vomit lol ",0.0,0.037561096,0,1
52,1fmp212,AITA for telling my friend that I'm not a mind-reader?,"This is a complicated story, and I want to preface it by saying that I am absolutely TA in part of this situation. I've accepted that, I've made amends and apologized to everyone involved, but part of it keeps bugging me. 

Within the past two years, I (30M) got very into D&D, and was hoping to start a campaign after my friend Fin (22NB) offered to DM. We had just left a bad table after another player turned out to be toxic AF, but we still wanted to play with the characters we had made. We found a few friends who wanted to play as well, and started a campaign that Fin chose.

Long story short, I ruined the game. I got way too excited, tried to act like a DM when I was supposed to be a player only, and in general I made Fin miserable. I felt absolutely terrible (and still do) for making what was supposed to be a fun situation stressful right after leaving a stressful table. I apologized to everyone involved, including Fin, and worked on strategies for being a better player at the table and respecting the other players and DM. Fin (who lives halfway across the country and was visiting) ran into me and we made up. I thought that was the end of it.

This situation concerns something that happened about a month before our initial falling out. Fin was hanging out at my place, building a character in D&D beyond who was going to be an NPC in the upcoming campaign. I asked Fin if I could design the character in Hero Forge. Fin said yes. I kept them involved in every step of the process, asking what they wanted the character to look like and what kind of features they wanted. I made a few suggestions, and Fin seemed to like them.

After our falling out and make-up, I asked Fin if they would like to join our table. I was acting as DM. Initially I felt uncomfortable taking over as DM, but I also didn't want to give up a new hobby because of a bad situation. Fin said they didn't mind, and agreed to join our table. They wanted to use their character that was originally going to be an NPC, but said they wanted to change it. I said absolutely, it's your character and you can change whatever you want about them.

Fin then stops talking to me. Full radio silence for over a month. I eventually reached out and asked why they stopped talking to me. They responded with a few long messages about how I don't respect them and they felt bad about me taking over the creation of their NPC and making it my own. I apologized for doing that, but pointed out that I asked Fin specifically if it was okay, and made sure to include them in every step of the process. I pointed out that I'm not a mind-reader and if they had a problem, they should tell me, because I don't want to upset my friends. Fin said ""You know I'm not very confrontational"". I tried apologizing, but Fin cut me off, and we haven't spoken in almost a year.

GF (19f) has a MacBook which also on the lighter end so initially she also asked to remote into my desktop to play games, do photoshop and illustrator. I agreed but then whenever she use it she would save files all over the place, she would also change the language and screen resolution. (Changing the resolution would mess up the desktop icon placement) Which is very annoying and she would still do it after I told her not to.

I told her that she can just get a mini pc for pretty cheap and use that instead of mine. Nope she doesn't want to spend money on something useless. I have pretty important project files on my pc and I'd rather not having her muck about on it so I was like screw it and I brought her a mini pc which can handle all the activities she needs to do but is still pretty weak compared to mine.

Fast forward to recently I gotten more project and my storage is running out, my specs are also kinda outdated so I bought another pc (I'll nickname it ""powerhouse"")

After I got ""powerhouse"" she asked for me for me to give her my ""beefy"" pc which I declined since I'm still using it to run some projects and I already gotten her a pc.

Few days ago she had this photoshop assignment and she wanted to do a big monster in a cityscape. She wanted to borrow ""beefy"" to render the monster in 3D. This assignment is due the next day and she has never touch 3D software before so I know it's impossible for her. I was studying for a Calculus quiz so I won't have time to help her. I told her she can use my pc but I won't be able to help her. She agrees and then proceeds to bug me with questions until I gave up and just posed it for her. (She also downloaded a bunch of files on my very low remaining storage)

So today I was out the entire day from 7am-10pm and was just exhausted. I wanted to play some games before bed and she said we should play together. She then ask for me just give her full perms to my computer and I declined (again pc has quite a bit of important files). She said I don't trust her enough. Since I just wanted a quick game before bed I just said think what you want but you can't use my pc

56,1fmoidg,AITA for making my pregnant SIL cry when she kept asking why I changed my name?,"My brother (30m) is married to Hailey (29f) and they're expecting a baby together. Last year I (17f) officially changed my first name from Evelyn to Indie (which was a nickname form of my original middle name). My parents gave in after realizing how serious I was about being Indie and how I was not warming up to or growing into Evelyn. 

My brother and Hailey want an older/vintage name for their baby and Hailey asked me about 5 months ago why I disliked Evelyn enough to change the name. At the time she brought up how popular the name has become and how vintage is back. I told her I didn't like vintage names and to me it sounded really old fashioned. I told her the popularity didn't influence my decision. She wanted to know my reason for disliking older names and why I liked something like Indie instead. I didn't mind her asking this first time.

She brought it up again a week later and she asked the same question and pressed more for why. She asked a third and a fourth time. I gave her the same answer and asked her why she kept asking me. I told her my answer wasn't going to change. By the seventh time she asked she admitted she was worried her baby would hate having an older name and wanted to figure out what she could do to prevent what happened with me happening to her. She also said she'd like me to rethink my name because she thought Evelyn was beautiful and she was sad I had chosen something like Indie over it. I asked her to stop so many times already and I even asked my brother to stop her. He told me I needed to understand it was the hormones. I can easily say she has asked me this more than 25 times by now. I'm not exaggerating that number either.

Two weeks ago when she brought it up again she felt like I had made a mistake changing my name and how 30 year old me wouldn't be so against Evelyn. I told her 30 year old me can deal with it if that happens. She told me I didn't really have a good reason to like the name and Indie seemed like the kind of name someone young likes but not someone older. Then yesterday happened and I kinda lost my temper. She started out asking the same stuff and the baby is almost ready to be born so I know it's coming to an end but she asked me to really think about why and help her because she couldn't figure out what she'd do differently than my parents did. Then she said they really shouldn't have let me change my name so young. I snapped and I told her to stop asking me the same question because my answer won't change and her comments are not changing my mind because I don't like old fashioned names. I told her I think they're awful and I'm sick and tired of hearing about how much better they are and having her try to make me find a reason she finds acceptable. I told her just like she hates Indie, I hate Evelyn and she needs to let it fucking go already. She burst into tears and my brother got so mad at me.

58,1fmobh1,AITA for telling my best friend to break up with her bf?,"Fake names

My best friend, Anna, and her boyfriend Seb have an on again off again relationship. We're currently in our last year of school and have our entrance exams coming up as well. 

They broke up the first time because she couldn't open up to him. That was last year. They got together again this year and broke up before summer break. I dunno the reason.

They were on break for a while because of communication issues. I suggested that they should take it slow and try to be comfortable around each other. It worked and now they were close and I also became friends with Seb. Seb and I became really close friends and I even tied him a rakhi (for anyone not from India, it means he's like my older brother). We related to each other because of our depressive episodes and humour. 

we're having our half yearlys/ midterms and it's incredibly stressful. They broke up again last night and got together this morning. I found it off that this happened so quickly and while consoling him, I noticed how he was talking. 

I realised he was talking in a self deprecating tone and had many 'jokes' about playing fruit ninja. Anna sent me the texts and I realised that Seb was literally begging Anna to not break up because his life has more meaning with her, he's a lot happier, he doesn't feel the urge to cut himself, etc. 

I think it's manipulation, because Anna feels guilty and bad about the break up and got together with him. And Seb is kinda oblivious/dumb sometimes so I don't think he's manipulating her on purpose, but it still is manipulation.

I also think im being TA because he does not know he's doing this and he keeps messaging me/mailing me to ask if Anna is mad at him.

It worked and now they were close and I also became friends with Seb. Seb and I became really close friends and I even tied him a rakhi (for anyone not from India, it means he's like my older brother). We related to each other because of our depressive episodes and humour. 

we're having our half yearlys/ midterms and it's incredibly stressful. They broke up again last night and got together this morning. I found it off that this happened so quickly and while consoling him, I noticed how he was talking. 

I realised he was talking in a self deprecating tone and had many 'jokes' about playing fruit ninja. Anna sent me the texts and I realised that Seb was literally begging Anna to not break up because his life has more meaning with her, he's a lot happier, he doesn't feel the urge to cut himself, etc. 

I think it's manipulation, because Anna feels guilty and bad about the break up and got together with him. And Seb is kinda oblivious/dumb sometimes so I don't think he's manipulating her on purpose, but it still is manipulation.

I also think im being TA because he does not know he's doing this and he keeps messaging me/mailing me to ask if Anna is mad at him.

I (20 f) just got back from a work trip that ended in my fiancé (23 m) driving 24 hours to come get me because I was in extreme emotional distress with no other way home.

Today we were both up and fairly motivated so I asked him if he could help me by doing dishes while I unpacked. He said yes and I thought I heard him doing dishes so I was happy. 

I finished unpacking and went to check on him to find that he had just taken our moldy gross dishes out of the sink and set them to the side. He proceeded to start on a project and I kept cleaning up a bit. After the room was somewhat clean I asked him to vacuum and he did so. 

Afterwards I asked again if he could finish the dishes and he said yes, after a short break. When he came back from his break he got distracted by his project again. This repeated three times until I just grabbed my knee braces and did the dishes myself. I told him that I don’t appreciate feeling like I have to ask and ask and ask for something to get done, just for me to do it myself. He said he didn’t want to hear it and put a pillow over his face and fell asleep.

60,1fmn7sk,AITA for questioning my SO’s friendship with a colleague?],"My SO (F30) and I (M30) have been in a long-distance relationship for over two years. Early on, she told me about a colleague, Adam, who confessed romantic feelings for her. She made it clear she wasn't interested and was limiting communication with him.

Fast forward six months: during a major argument, she asked for space and reduced our usual daily calls/texts. While I was away, and she was home alone, she invited Adam over for dinner and drinks, telling him he could crash on the air mattress if he drank too much. I found out he had come over when I accidentally saw their texts later.
When I confronted her, she initially denied it but eventually admitted he had come over but didn’t stay the night and claimed nothing happened. I expressed my discomfort, and she agreed to be more transparent about future meet-ups with him. Despite this, over the next 1.5 years, I discovered she had hung out with Adam twice—once for a movie and dinner (she says there was another mutual friend!
) and once for coffee—without telling me.

So, onto the actual event for which im currently wondering AIO? Fast forward to 2 months ago, I semi moved into my SOs apartment and have been working remotely. During these 2 months, we’ve hung out with a few of her friends and colleagues but not Adam. About 2 weeks ago I had to travel back to my apartment for a work related matter and stayed there for a week. I got back to my SOs apartment a few days ago and we were having a conversation about something unrelated during which I asked her where he had been on the weekend I was out. She reacted defensively to my question and that made me suspicious so I asked if I could see her phone to which she agreed. 

I see a conversation with Adam from the day after I left her apartment that goes something like this. 

Adam: Are you in the office today ?

SO: No, working on an important project from home.

Adam: Don’t you get distracted at home ?

SO: No not really. I’m alone, my boyfriend left.

Adam: Should I come over to disturb you?

SO: Yea come over on Sunday if you’re free.

I confronted her about this and she said that he never did come over it was just a plan but nothing happened.

61,1fmn2c3,AITA for laughing at my BF’s back-handed joke?,"There’s obviously more to this.

Tonight, my boyfriend (23M) and I (23F) went to a small get together with a group of mutual friends.

We got there, and one of the couples announced that she was 18 weeks pregnant with a cute belly bump. I noticed her drinking from a tall can at this time, and upon hearing the news, told myself that it must be sparkling water. 

After saying our congratulations, we all then were sat in a circle enjoying a few beverages and bants. 

I looked to my left in disbelief.

Now, my boyfriend and I are not typically judgemental people. We are also not very confrontational, as everyone has their own personal backgrounds and beliefs.

However… this woman was, to our realization, actually finishing (what we assume) her first alcoholic beverage of the night and was moving on to a Molsen Canadian (beer).

I, myself, bit my tongue but I doubt my face read as though I hadn’t noticed. 

My boyfriend was talking to the father, and also had noticed her alcohol consumption throughout the night. After a brief conversation of how the BD’s work is full of alcoholics and drug addicts, my boyfriend chimed in with his back-handed joke.

The father said: “My coworker told me he doesn’t do crack anymore, he just snorts pure cocaine.” (As if that’s better).

My boyfriend responded: “That industry is messed up. My old boss used to tell me that his Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is what made him so smart.”

I laughed. Threw my head back even. Shockingly, the baby daddy also chuckled… probably not picking up on the back-handed joke while being a few drinks deep. 

The expecting mother’s face grew cross. She put her drink down immediately.

Leaving the party, I feel a sense of strange guilt for not saying anything to her directly. I also feel as if that would have possibly been edging none-of-my-business territory.

My mom’s brother, Robert (42M), and I have always had a strained relationship. He’s often tried to parent me, which has pushed me away over the years. He left his corporate job due to anxiety and spent three years unemployed, supported by his wife. Now, he’s apprenticing as an electrician.

My mom has her own issues with Robert, but she asked him to help with some electrical work in our new house, offering to pay him and cover his gas. After much convincing, he finally agreed.

Yesterday, Robert arrived and today they started the work. I woke up early to help make breakfast and was immediately greeted with career advice from Robert, which I wasn’t in the mood for, especially before 9 a.m. I took over cooking and cleaning, then spent the rest of the morning applying for jobs.

Later in the afternoon, I got a migraine and retreated to my room. While they were working on the electrical stuff, Robert kept asking me to grab tools for him. My mom intervened, reminding him I wasn’t feeling well, but when she left, he snapped at me for not helping with the house work over the last 48 hours. This isn’t the first time he’s criticized me, and I’d had enough. I told him he was being a prick, which escalated the situation. I ended up leaving my room, my only safe space.

To clarify, they only started the electrical work today, and Robert arrived late last night, spending the evening drinking while I made snacks and cleaned. Throughout the day, he took jabs at corporate jobs, which irritated me. Now, I’ve decided to avoid him for the rest of his visit.

65,1fmmafm,AITA for yelling at my wife because she wanted me to wish her happy birthday? ,"Hello, first time posting here so I apologize if this is a mess. 

Just a little backstory for why I’m especially upset, today I (F27) took my wife (F29) to a popular arcade and crane machine center for her birthday, we had been saving money for this day which was about $70 from me plus the $50 my wife had on her. In total that was $120 just for her to spend on whatever she wanted at the arcade. 

We had a fun time, a good night I thought. When we got home we were just relaxing after the long day, I made some food and was just having a little conversation with my brother over messenger when my wife says “you forgot”. I realized the clock hit 12:01. I had forgotten to wish her happy birthday at exactly midnight like she had been asking me to do for the last 6 years we’ve been together. I always forget. But to me this seems like a bit of a silly request to expect of someone. However to her, it’s important. 
She got mad and told me “you suck”. This of course upset me because I thought we had a good day together. I gave her the last of my money for the arcade, got her the things she wants but now I suck because I didn’t wish her happy birthday at exactly midnight? I know this is something she asks for but I just genuinely wasn’t looking at the clock. I would’ve wished her a happy birthday the moment I saw it was after midnight. 

Being upset, I told her I thought she was being petty and neurotic and it was unfair of her to get mad at me for this. 
This became a screaming match about how I can’t do anything she asks (which isn’t true) which then made me cry, which just made her more upset. Now we are in separate rooms not talking. This whole experience may not seem like a big deal in hindsight but it hurts to hear these things be said when I thought I was doing good for her. 

Also just to add, I also suffer from mental illness (major depression, generalized anxiety) so this situation may be affecting me badly because of this, I’m unsure, but it’s definitely triggered bad feelings so I need to know if I’m overreacting or not. 

So am I the asshole for yelling at her or calling her neurotic? Should I have just said sorry and moved on? I feel like I’m crazy for even posting any of this 🥲 this whole situation just kind of spiraled

UPDATE: 
I appreciate all the responses. In hindsight, I realize I was an asshole. My wife and I did speak on calmer terms and I did apologize. I shouldn’t question what’s important to her, I should just respect it. It’s a simple request and not something I should’ve gotten so worked up over.

This became a screaming match about how I can’t do anything she asks (which isn’t true) which then made me cry, which just made her more upset. Now we are in separate rooms not talking. This whole experience may not seem like a big deal in hindsight but it hurts to hear these things be said when I thought I was doing good for her. 

Also just to add, I also suffer from mental illness (major depression, generalized anxiety) so this situation may be affecting me badly because of this, I’m unsure, but it’s definitely triggered bad feelings so I need to know if I’m overreacting or not. 

So am I the asshole for yelling at her or calling her neurotic? Should I have just said sorry and moved on? I feel like I’m crazy for even posting any of this 🥲 this whole situation just kind of spiraled

UPDATE: 
I appreciate all the responses. In hindsight, I realize I was an asshole. My wife and I did speak on calmer terms and I did apologize. I shouldn’t question what’s important to her, I should just respect it. It’s a simple request and not something I should’ve gotten so worked up over. I’ve set an annual alarm so this does not happen again. ",1.0,1.0679823,1,1
66,1fmm5fr,AITA for causing a scene at my birthday dinner I explicitly asked not to happen?,"I have AuDHD and really struggle with social events and unfortunately still live with my parents at 30. I've never had good birthdays so I've been very clear with family and friends that all I want is a ""happy birthday"" text, no dinner, no gifts, no cake. If there has to be a dinner, all I want (as I have for over 10 years now) is a pepperoni pizza from dominos(my comfort food) and minimal social contact.

Anyways for the past 5 years I've been incredibly vocal about this desire, and every year they schedule a family dinner without asking me and don't tell me till the day of. Its always roast beef and potato's; the same meal we've had at every family event for the past 25 years straight. Every year I tell them I don't want cake, and that I would have preferred pizza if its ""my birthday meal"". 

This year, I was told as my family was walking in the door we were having a birthday dinner(context I need 24+h notice for social gatherings to be able to mentally prep for minimal burnout after) and barely had enough time to even have a shower. I got a bit snippy during dinner and told em it clearly wasn't my birthday dinner because this is none of the things I like(they even chose the one form of corn I don't like). Everyone ignored me, even cracking a few jokes about the fact I wanted pizza instead of a home cooked roast. I barely ate and left after about 20 minutes at the table and secluded myself in my room(not without a few comments from the peanut gallery first about leaving the table). A hour later I get summoned back because its cake time even though I just told them I didn't want any. I took a minute to compose myself with the intent of just getting a slice to keep peace, but when I got to the kitchen they had already cut it and were eating the cake without me.

This is where I might be the asshole, because as soon as I seen that they didn't even wait for me(they actually started dinner while I was in the shower too), any composure I had went out the window and I interrupted their convo to tell them I don't want ""their"" cake and start explaining why I'm upset and that clearly none of this was actually for me. Then my sister interrupts me ""Even if you don't eat the cake your still getting older"" and my other sister says ""Its just dinner then! Not birthday dinner!"" effectively saying I'm old and cranky and pretending I have no grounds to be upset. So I responded with ""Well enjoy your fucking dessert then"" and left. (additional context I was told several times before hand it was my birthday dinner despite it actually being several days before my real birthday).

Now both of my sisters are mad at me for causing a scene ""over cake"". And I feel like even more garbage for standing up for myself then I would if I'd have just suffered quietly.

I had a couple rules for using my stuff, nothing crazy I just wanted it rinsed out or washed and I didn’t want them putting any of my pots in the fridge with food still in them, not too bad right? Well apparently that was too much and there would be multiple times I would see them using my cookware, I’d go to bed, than get up in the morning to see it filthy. Not rinsed, not wiped off, nothing.

68,1fmla2f,AITA for asking my (30F) bf (30M) not to do psychedelics?,"My bf of almost a year and I are at a cottage trip with his friends this weekend. I don’t know any of them (only met some of them once or twice). A bunch of them want to drop acid today and/or microdose on shrooms. I asked him not to because I don’t want to do either around people I don’t know (I’ve done them plenty, so has he, but I’m now sober for the most part and he knows that). 

Initially he resisted and said why not, everyone else is doing it etc. He got pretty visibly angry. He even compared me to the other girlfriends there and said they didn’t have an issue, so I said he should go date one of them. And he asked me to come to this trip and I came just for him — I don’t know his friends and knew it’d be awkward but he really wanted me to come — and I started getting immense anxiety at the thought of being stuck 3.5 hours away from home with a bunch of random people on psychedelics. 

I told him if he wants to do it that’s OK, but I’m not obliged to stay here and I’ll take the car and drive back home. He did not like this. I told him I don’t want to feel trapped and I’m not ready to see him tripping — I’d rather do it on our own time when it’s just the two of us. 

He told me I was being manipulative for saying I’ll leave if he does it, but I don’t think I was? I am allowed to leave a situation I’m not comfortable in? He got pissed but after a few minutes he calmed down and said it was okay, he won’t do it, and he doesn’t need to do it right now because he’s done it plenty before. 

But now I’m questioning myself and feeling guilty for setting boundaries that now feel controlling.

We are both gamers. It’s a part of what connected us in the first place. But his hobby has become more than that. While we work FT jobs he has tended to spend a lot of time in the last year or so gaming. He comes home and spends time with myself and the kids, then gets to gaming. At first this was a was a relief, he deserves to unwind and relax, but after a few months it was clear it was more. He up late. I asked if he was okay after a week. He finally told me that he had started working to do gaming tournaments. Awesome. I love doing special events/tournaments inside my hobbies, let’s plan accordingly around the kids. I am happy he is happy. He said no, he planned to pursue it, taking time off work, traveling, being gone for days or even a week at a time. He told me he isn’t doing well at his practice tournaments. He is losing more often than not. He was so angry about it. Saying he was working so hard and not winning. I didn’t understand a lot of what he was saying as I don’t play those games. But it was as clear he was frustrated. I tried to talk him back down to enjoying the game and if he did he might do better. Or go to local tournaments to build up his skills before attempting bigger. I go to events and tournaments with my own skill level and mostly expect to lose to better players, but he was more angry than anything. There is a big tournament coming up that takes him out of state for more than a week. He wants to go. After that conversation I think it’s a bad idea. His anxiety and depression that seemed to come out of nowhere suddenly make sense now. He loves and understands the game and there is nothing bad about working up your experience points to get to where you want to be. But it would be a huge financial blow. He lost it and told me I was a b-word who got good because I was a girl and no one cared in my games. He said a lot of ugly things. I was hurt and angry so I told him flat out that he was just a jerk pursuing a hobby he will never be good at and he needs a reality check.

So I have had a job since I was 14, it has not been the same job for the last 3, almost 4 years, but my family isn’t well off and I wanted to try and aleve some of the pressure off my mom. Which she has told me it has. So right now, I work 4 days a week, (tue, thur, sat, sun) from from 5-10pm on weekdays and around 9 hours on weekends. My younger brother(bro) doesn’t have a job. He goes to school and then comes home, normally to watch YouTube. On the days I’m not working, I’m either at rehearsal for my schools play, babysitting for extra cash, or  hanging out with my boyfriend. all that to say, I’m normally home at 10pm ish, to which I then go to bed. The biggest problem with this in our house is our 2 dogs. They can’t be left unsupervised, if my mom is at work during the day, they are in their kennels until someone gets home to let them out and stuff. So because I’m not home being at work and other things, normally the job falls on my brother or mom. So today, I was at work from 10am- 8pm. A normal shift for me, but still a long one.

At around 9 I left my room to grab a snack from the kitchen and my mom was gone. My brother came out of his room and asked what I was doing. Then he started to go back into his room, I asked where he was going and this started the argument. He told me I should stay out and watch them because he always had to watch them. I said that that wasn’t fair because I was around other people all day and wanted to unwind in my room for the night. He had all day to be in his room and alone. I didn’t. I always tell him, when you don’t have a job outside of home, your job is at home, helping. We went back and forth a bit more before he just got pissed off, told me to shut up and say on the couch with the dogs. I told him it wasn’t nice to tell someone to shut up just because you are losing an argument, to which he said he didn’t lose, he just didn’t wanna argue anymore. Then I went back to my room to type this. I don’t know, I don’t think I’m in the wrong here for wanting space after working, when he doesn’t do anything except watch YouTube.

I always tell him, when you don’t have a job outside of home, your job is at home, helping. We went back and forth a bit more before he just got pissed off, told me to shut up and say on the couch with the dogs. I told him it wasn’t nice to tell someone to shut up just because you are losing an argument, to which he said he didn’t lose, he just didn’t wanna argue anymore. Then I went back to my room to type this. I don’t know, I don’t think I’m in the wrong here for wanting space after working, when he doesn’t do anything except watch YouTube. And yes, I do love our dogs. And if he did actually get a job outside of the house, I would be more than willing to evenly divide the time out with the dogs.

72,1fmkvxl,AITA for not responding to a strangers texts? ,"So for context, I am currently in college and taking a course on insects, and for this we have to go out and collect them. I met this stranger when I was out collecting some. He had asked what I was doing and I talked to him about it for a bit (I do a lot of outreach with insects so this is normal for me). 

Afterwards, we started talking about life and such and we ended up exchanging numbers. I didn't think much of it, but I went on my way. 

He texted me the night we met and I had forgotten to respond, as I was busy with homework. The next day I was also busy when he had sent me another text about insects and I didn't think much about responding, as I am not a great texter and sometimes forget to respond for multiple days at a time. 

Later that night he texted that he didn't realize that I was ""on my usual white morality and structure things"" and to delete his number. I genuinely don't know if I did anything wrong, but I hadn't expected that. So I apologized, when he responded that ""it was fine but he already deleted my number, tho if we see each other again to say hi"" so I acknowledged that, deleted the contact, and wished him a good day and semester, to which he then said that he thought that I wouldn't want him to have my number and to delete his if that was the case.

74,1fmk897,AITA for buying my daughter a joke gift that technically corresponds to what she asked for,"I have a daughter (16F) and a son (15M). My son is really into PC building and gaming and my daughter is as well but not to the same extent and mostly just copies me and my son when she chose games and pc upgrades with her allowance.

Last year near my son's birthday his monitor broke and he needed a new one so I got him a really good Alienware monitor (AW3423DW). It uses a display tech called OLED where each pixel self illuminates as opposed to a backlight for the whole screen which makes images look really good especially in HDR settings. We also have a TV with this sort of display. My daughter loves our TV and when she saw my son's monitor she also wanted one and has been hinting that she wants an oled monitor for her birthday.

I asked her about it and she does want one but not for working but only for when she plays games but she said I don't have to as she knows it is expensive and she already has a working monitor, She also said she does not mind if it is a smaller cheaper one as long as it is an oled screen.

Since she has a working monitor albeit a basic office type one I felt it did not really make sense to get the oled monitor.

For her birthday I got her a tiny monochrome blue oled screen like this [https://www.amazon.com/Hosyond-Display-Self-Luminous-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0BFD4X6YV/](https://www.amazon.com/Hosyond-Display-Self-Luminous-Compatible-Raspberry/dp/B0BFD4X6YV/) . I then put it in the box of the monitor I got my son and wrapped it. This was obviously a joke and technically fit her criteria. However she got really upset and went to her room and cried and has been acting cold since.

I did obviously get her a dress as a nice gift but she is upset and has not unwrapped it yet.

Admittedly, I kind of just rejected the idea immediately, which pissed her off, but that's because I'm already feeling a bit overwhelmed.

For context, when we got married, my wife insisted that we buy a big house with a lot of property.  She also insisted that we get two dogs and three horses against my judgement.  The house was expensive and the understanding was that my wife was going to work full time.

Since the birth of our first, she dropped down to part time (3 days per week) and has thrust basically everything else on me.

To pay for my wife to drop down to part-time, I took on a second job and some weeks work 14-hour days.

76,1fmk1mg,AITA for turning my uncle against my cousin and her mother by accident?,"So, I (14F) feel pretty bad because everyone is saying that I basically turned my own cousin’s (28F) dad against her when he refused to walk her down the aisle, and even left her wedding altogether, when my cousin intentionally uninvited me to her wedding at the the very last minute.

My uncle ‘adopted’ me when I was super young after both of my parents died. I don’t know all of the details, since my uncle didn’t want me to know too much about the very tragic details behind my parents’ death. 

But based on what my aunt and cousin told me, or like to constantly tell me about why this “poor excuse” is why my uncle likes to “favor” me more over his own daughter, it was because my dad -his brother- died when I was super young, and my mother decided to “join my dad” shortly after he died. 

And because of this, they don’t like how my uncle and I are super close to each other, sometimes to the point that it did seem like he favored me more than his own daughter. Since my uncle and I are more in common than my cousin is to her own dad. Which is something I always felt bad about, since I didn’t want to feel like I was taking her own dad from her.

But regardless, I thought that my cousin’s family wasn’t mean enough to do anything but insult me. At least, until today when my aunt silently dropped me off at one of her friend’s house after school, as she said that she needed me to stay at a friend’s house, since “she and the rest of the family” all had plans later and no one would be home to watch over me.

But after being dropped off, I slowly got more scared of my aunt’s friend, because her friend was acting all creepy around me. Like those creepy predator behavior that adults keeps warning you about that made me scared enough to lock myself in one of his room and call my uncle for help, because I didn’t want to be in his house anymore.

Well, my uncle got to the house very quickly after I called him, and he decided to take me to my other aunt’s apartment- the one that was related to my dead mom. And I felt bad, since I thought I interrupted him during like an important party, since he came in to get me with a suit, even if I thanked him for getting me.

However, later on, it turns out the important party was my cousin’s wedding. Which I didn’t know was today, since I thought it was going to be next month.

And my cousin and aunt blasted my phone with horrible messages about how I ruined my cousin’s big day, and how I ruined their family the moment my uncle took me in. And that I was just an unwanted and jealous b-word that couldn’t be happy with just having a roof over my head, but that I also had to “take my cousin’s father away from her.”

I feel really awful, because I didn’t mean to cause so much trouble. But my uncle and other aunt told me that it isn’t my fault, and they were being out of control for acting this way.

One of our cats gets along with her, the other 3 ignore her, but it's taken several months to get to this point.

For several weeks my husband has been joking around that ""our dog needs a dog"". I've wholeheartedly said ""NO"" every single time. I was getting tired of the comments, so a couple of weeks ago I told him to please stop, the joke was getting old. I thought we were past it.

He's been sitting on this with his friend for the last six weeks, and his friend never said ""hey, kaett said don't do it, this isnt' a good idea,"" nor did they let me know what was coming.

She was well socialized with experienced ~~reputable, ethical breeders~~ owners whose pair of black labs have had previous litters.  They keep an eye on when the dam goes into heat, it sounds like they just missed it this time and she was pregnant before they realized she was in season again.

*  We made an agreement 20 years ago when we first moved in together that all pet cleanup would be his responsibility.  He has always handled all litterbox and poop duties without complaint.  So yes, he absolutely does his share of pet care and always has.

*  Regarding our pets' quality of life:  we have a large home with a fenced backyard.  The cats have an outdoor enclosure off the family room, a large cat tree, and run of the house.  The existing dog has plenty of toys, a giant kennel that she loves, and a large dog bed.  Logistically, yes we could handle a second dog, I'm just at my personal limit and much more of a cat person than a dog person.

Some additional information that I didn't have last night:

*  My husband knew he was the AH even before I said ""reddit says you're the AH.""  He had made backup plans to rehome the puppy in the event that I totally and completely flipped my shit on this, such as having an alternate home for her (his old boss who recently lost one of their labs to old age), puppy food, collar, harness, and toys, as well as being willing to sleep in the guest bedroom for the week.

*  He knows FULLY WELL he has burned a lot of my trust and needs to make it up to me.  Our marriage is not wrecked.  We've been through worse and come out stronger on the other side.

*  I have implemented several conditions for this situation:

, has been negative about my relationship from the start and has told me not to talk about him when we’re together. I understood and respected her request, so I don’t bring him up much. 

Recently, I stayed at her house for three days, and yesterday I texted my boyfriend and called him twice. He’s on a long bike trip (about 18 hours), and we’ve been checking in on each other. It’s not like he’s demanding constant updates, but I worry about him, so I check in. She wasn’t happy about it and said she’s “rethinking things.” She feels that I share too much about my day with him and that it’s rude to talk to him even for a few minutes while we’re hanging out. I told her I get it, but I still check on him because I care.

She has always been a bit pessimistic about this relationship, mainly because I’ve had bad experiences in the past, and I think she’s trying to protect me. But her telling me I’m a bad friend for this hurt me. I’ve tried to respect her boundaries, but I don’t feel like I’m doing anything too wrong by checking in on my boyfriend, especially when he’s on a risky trip.

Our friendship has been a bit rocky lately. We don’t text each other often, and when I don’t reach out, she doesn’t either. Once, we went a whole month without speaking because I stopped initiating conversations. When I finally asked her why she never reached out, she said it’s because she always initiates with her other friends and doesn’t feel like doing the same with me, which I found unfair.

Also, I’ve been dealing with some personal issues, including emotional abuse from my mom. I used to confide in my cousin, but over the last year, she’s become distant, and I’ve leaned more on my boyfriend for support. Talking to him helps me cope, but she thinks I’ve become too dependent on him and claims he’s toxic for even asking what I’m doing. I feel like she doesn’t understand relationships well since she’s never been in one, and she’s facing her own pressure to get married, which might be affecting her judgment.

I know I might be wrong for texting my boyfriend and checking in as often as I do, but it doesn’t feel like I’m the only one at fault here. AITA?

It’s not like he’s demanding constant updates, but I worry about him, so I check in. She wasn’t happy about it and said she’s “rethinking things.” She feels that I share too much about my day with him and that it’s rude to talk to him even for a few minutes while we’re hanging out. I told her I get it, but I still check on him because I care.

She has always been a bit pessimistic about this relationship, mainly because I’ve had bad experiences in the past, and I think she’s trying to protect me. But her telling me I’m a bad friend for this hurt me. I’ve tried to respect her boundaries, but I don’t feel like I’m doing anything too wrong by checking in on my boyfriend, especially when he’s on a risky trip.

Our friendship has been a bit rocky lately. We don’t text each other often, and when I don’t reach out, she doesn’t either. Once, we went a whole month without speaking because I stopped initiating conversations. When I finally asked her why she never reached out, she said it’s because she always initiates with her other friends and doesn’t feel like doing the same with me, which I found unfair.

Also, I’ve been dealing with some personal issues, including emotional abuse from my mom. I used to confide in my cousin, but over the last year, she’s become distant, and I’ve leaned more on my boyfriend for support. Talking to him helps me cope, but she thinks I’ve become too dependent on him and claims he’s toxic for even asking what I’m doing. I feel like she doesn’t understand relationships well since she’s never been in one, and she’s facing her own pressure to get married, which might be affecting her judgment.

I know I might be wrong for texting my boyfriend and checking in as often as I do, but it doesn’t feel like I’m the only one at fault here. AITA? ",0.0,0.07072971,0,1
79,1fmjrgi,AITA for expecting my husband to let me read the menu before ordering food at a drive through and manage his ADHD meds if the context changes?,"So yesterday morning I went down to get a blood test and felt like I was going to pass out afterwards. I texted my husband if he was awake, and if so, could he please pick me up as I wasn’t well and didn’t feel safe to drive. Just for context we live 10 mins away from the blood test place and he confirmed he was awake and was ok to come down.

For context, my husband is diagnosed ADHD and takes meds for it.

On the way home we talk about going through the local coffee drive through we both like as he hasn’t had breakfast it’s a weekend and honestly food and drink help when you’re feeling woozy. 

On the drive we talk about what to order and my husband decides to get his regular order. When asked what I want, I say Im not sure. We do agree to order a banana bread to share as a snack. 

When we arrive, my husband drives straight past the menu board for food and goes straight to the window to order. I say I haven’t decided I need to look at the menu board to order and tell him that makes me feel like he didn’t consider me and it feels like since he knew his order he just steamrolled past the menu without checking if I need to read it.

Husband then suggests we go through to the other side of the drive through so I can read the menu. Ok, all good. Except he pulls up at the food menu then drives past the coffee menu so I didn’t get a chance to read it. 

Im then too upset to order. Husband leaves the drive through but in doing so, drives in a frustrated way, which is faster then normal. This makes the car jerky and I ask him to drive more gently as I’m still feeling dizzy.

When we get home I tell my husband I’m upset and he didn’t consider where I was at, just because he knew what he wanted to order doesn’t mean I did and it’s common etiquette to let people read the menu before ordering. Husband said because he has ADHD his brain doesn’t work like that and I shouldn’t expect him to know that and I should ask before we get there to look at the menu. I said this isn’t a me specific thing and he should be capable of remembering and applying some context since I’m the one unwell in this situation.

He said it wasn’t his fault as he hadn’t taken his medication that morning. We do normally plan for him to have time off, but those times are flexible. I also mentioned going down for my tests the night before. I said in a medical situation I shouldn’t have to remind him, he should be able to manage his medication and take them if something like this happens. 

I do understand ADHD affects executive functioning but I also feel like he used it as an excuse to not take responsibility for his actions. AITA?

EDIT: in response to a comment saying this is pertinent information- I have issues with visual recall which my husband knows. I can’t just bring up a memory of what was on the menu board from last time, I can’t visualise it. 

Edit 2 In addition, the menu board lists the allergens which is more reliable then relying on staff who don’t always know. There’s also no internal restaurant it’s just a drive through.

Edit 3. Reading from my phone in the car makes me carsick at the best of times, not something I can do whilst feeling woozy.

Edit 4. Ok it’s clear that on this thread that IATA - I take it on board and will apologise to hubby for my incorrect assumption that everyone uses the menu board and drive through like I do. One thought I did have was I wonder if there was a high demographic of younger folks here which could explain the preference for going online for the menu. 

But wow. I’d like to point out that that throughout my post and comments I used respectful language, gave further information when questioned or told it was pertinent, and didn’t argue or debate anyone’s AITA verdict, didn’t give any personal attacks. For a bunch of people that were criticising me for my post I’d like to point out that many of the comments were aggressive, there was yelling, personal attacks, name calling (prissy, diva, child muppet, massive fucking baby, to name a few), wild assumptions, accusations that I was lying, people incorrect saying I hated my husband’s neurodivergence, and people telling me to grow up, ironically while doing many of the above. 

For those who provided insightful and respectful comments about the different perspectives of a drive through, interpersonal conflict, marriage and communication- thank you. Also thank you to those who checked in to make sure I was ok and those who asked good questions and provided feedback that I’m not the only person who reads a menu. 

I will put this last edit into a comment so people can downvote me all they like.

80,1fmjqd3,AITA for refusing to take care of my roommates dog? ,"To preface, I’m not a dick and I do love animals. If she (the pup) ever whines or asks for food/water/potty and I’m home alone, I’ll take care of her. She’s just a dog, my issues aren’t with her and I do love her. I’d never let her suffer just because I don’t really like pets. 

So my roommate (f27) got her dog a few years ago. We hadn’t really discussed it outside of me saying I (26f) didn’t want the responsibility of caring for something (I’m not great at caring for myself, I don’t think it would be fair on an animal if I failed to care for it). When she came home with the dog I was kind of pissed but like it was too late. 

So I explicitly stated I will not take any responsibility. No walking, feeding, nothing (again, unless it’s clearly urgent I’ll of course step in). She fully agreed and that was fine but sometimes she will go to her parents with the intent to return the same day and leave the dog at the apartment. The dog is very chill and just sleeps or hangs with me in the living room most of them time so it’s whatever but she text at 10pm having left at 11am asking for me to feed and walk her and that she’s staying the night and I said no. I told her she left her dog (if she knows she’s spending the night, she brings the dog) and she needs to come home because I refuse to feed and walk her (I actually fed her and walked her at 8 already but that’s besides the point). She’s mad that she has to drive the 2 hours home in the middle of the night because I won’t help but I set that boundary forever ago and I won’t back down on it. If she had asked before leaving then maybe I would have agreed but forcing it on me when there’s no other option? What am I gonna do? Let her starve? Pee in the house(gross)? Our mutual friend thinks I’m the asshole here because I should help her out and maybe I should but idk I don’t think I am the ass hole for stating I’m not responsible for her pet. 

Additional: I guess I also am just starting to feel bad because I know how much work having a dog is (hence why I know I shouldn’t have one) so I feel almost like I SHOULD be helping her out because it takes a lot but I seriously don’t want to ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-22,"AITA for refusing to take care of my roommates dog?

81,1fmjjf4,AITA for going back on my word to help my brother with his new puppy after his 1-year-old dog died 2 weeks ago?,"As the title suggests, my brother's 1-year-old German Shepherd, Oakley, got hit by a car and died 2 weeks ago while under the care of paid professionals training him for his safety. When he was a puppy, many of the responsibilities of taking care of him while my brother, ""Nick"", was away were placed on me, who had no idea he had any plans of adopting a pup in the first place. It was fair seeing as the rest of my family works at our diner & I was unemployed due to a mental health relapse, but it became apparent in the first month that I would not be able to do it for very long.

I for some reason was the only one in the house Oakley would consistently refuse to potty outside for. I would take him out for 20+ minutes at a time, nothing. Every time, he’d soil somewhere in the house upon minutes of me bringing him back in. It was tiresome and discouraging, especially while the rest of my family never dealt with the same thing. While he’d have accidents with everyone, the rest of my family always got him to potty outside. My family’s advice was discouraging as they all implied it was something I was doing wrong—not paying enough attention to him, taking him outside enough, or looking for cues—even though I spent time with him everyday while they worked. Every solution disregarded saying how I wasn’t doing enough, but whenever I expressed frustration about this, I was told that I was putting words in their mouth and wanted to be a victim. I understand they wanted to help, but I hated how they refused to acknowledge their hurtful words.

As of now, Nick is adopting a puppy in 2 days. Nick, mom, and I agreed to help take care of him. I was excited to be a part of the dog's life, but that changed when my mom suggested I feed him on the days he leaves for work. I said it'd be good to reinforce me as primary caretaker so we didn’t run into Oak’s issues, but Nick disagreed, giving alternative explanations as to why it happened, and it was pure insults: ""We know he picked favorites for a reason; you didn’t engage with him enough; I’m not going to ignore the reality that you play League for 16 hours a day"",  things like that. It was a repeat of how I felt suggesting some of the responsibility be levied to daycare and not entirely on me, since he “thought it’d be fine because I  wasn’t doing anything anyway” and that “he hardly needs to be watched so he thought I could handle it.” That he was both a small responsibility I should’ve been able to handle, but also a massive one that I neglected. Whichever was more hurtful was his stance. Whichever would guilt me into helping. During this conversation, he constantly equated Oakley’s obedience to the amount of love he had for me, while trying to also say he appreciated what I did and that he doesn’t understand why I’m taking it personally. Ultimately, I’m going to take back what I said and help, but I’ve been treated like my feelings are invalid for so long that I can never tell when I’m being crazy or rational.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-22,"AITA for going back on my word to help my brother with his new puppy after his 1-year-old dog died 2 weeks ago?

82,1fmjcym,AITA for reminding my daughter of her past failures.,"I have a daughter who is in college studying computer science. She is doing quite well and talks to me about her school related decisions a lot. 

We were talking and she said that she probably won't but sometimes she wonders if she should change her major to math. This is because she is contemplating adding a math minor and took some extra math classes as electives because she wanted to avoid arts classes where she has to write essays. I warned her that her success there does not mean she would be great at math as these are easier electives. She took advanced calc, real analysis and algebraic topology of which I think only advanced calc is a real math class but she had to take the pre reqs as required classes for computer science. The others are different sort of classes and more about proofs than math.

Here is where I might be an asshole. My daughter really struggled with math until high school and when she was very young we even saw specialists because it seemed like there was something mentally wrong with her. I mean like she was completely unable to comprehend basic calculation as a kid and failed math many times, up until middle school where she got barely passing grades then somehow in high school she started doing extremely well to the point that her teachers and even me initially wondered if she was cheating.

She likes to pretend it never happened these days so talking about it strikes a nerve. I reminded her of it and she called me an AH for bringing it up.

However I just do not want her to make a mistake and ruin her academic record which has been 'repaired' since college. I am concerned that her previous issues might come back if she did more math. She currently does not want to switch but just in case she starts thinking more seriously of doing so.",Asshole,2024-09-22,"AITA for reminding my daughter of her past failures.

Alright, Baseball Folks.  Here’s a good one that pissed me off.

Today, I show up to our game and he tells me his son won’t be there he had the opportunity to play a soccer game with an older age team. Okay.  Great.  We start the game. Get a few innings in.  We have been letting a rotation of about 6 pitchers pitch one inning at a time only per game to get the kids to get some experience.  Everyone gets a chance.  No hurt feelings.  It’s a brutal walk fest.  Lol.  Except for this one kid, Chase, who today had an awesome inning and I thought deserved the chance to  stay in on the mound to throw another inning.  Well, before we are about to begin our last inning he says to me his son might make it here in time and he is going to put him in to pitch.  I’m like, dude, there are three other kids here that have been here since the beginning of the game that have been begging to pitch, and this other boy, Chase, just had the best inning of the season with no runs allowed and you think it’s acceptable for your son to just show up at the end of the game and go right on the mound?

86,1fmijqc,WIBTA if i decided to not talk to my sister until she apologizes? ,"So basically a bit of backstory, my sister and I are still in HS. She takes multiple AP (Advance placement classes) that are extremely difficult. I also take AP classes however not as much as her.

The problem is that she never ever does what I ask her to do. I usually have to clean the whole house because I know no one else would ever get it done (our mom usually travels for work), and I admit i’m not perfect but i’m trying my best. 

Whenever I ask her to do something like clean the bathroom or clean the living room (literally just fixing some pillows on couches) she’ll say she’ll do it, and then never does. Or it takes her literal days to do it. But she does fix stuff in the house like putting away the dishes, doing the laundry, changing our parents bed sheets, but she’ll never do something like vacuuming or like a full on deep clean of the house. Just little stuff here and there. Which take days for the house to fully be clean and by the time it is she has to redo it bc the house got messy again (we have multiple ppl living w us rn it’s complicated but they don’t help and i can’t change that). 

I’m honestly so done w it but she really pissed me off today. Our mom was fixing something’s and was super tired, so she asked me if my sister and I could change her bedsheets bc she wanted to go straight to bed. 

My sister was taking a nap so i woke her up and asked  if she could help, she said no she was tired. I told her it was for our mom and if she could please come and help bc she was tired and I wanted to do it right (I don’t normally change the sheets and i had just spent the day helping my mom fix up some stuff as well and other stuff so I was tired NOTE- She didn’t really do anything all day). She again refused so I was pissed off and ended up doing it myself. 

Now I’m contemplating just not talking to her until she actually apologizes (she never does) bc I’m just so done and tired of cleaning up everyone’s mess. She’s literally seen me cry for hours bc I was so stressed out. My mom was so concerned she told me to just leave till she came back.

87,1fmighf,AITA for hiding my brother's toilet seat?,"So to give context to this extremely weird situation I've found myself in.

My brother (31) and I (26) are both grown adults living with my Mother (58). I live with her because currently she and I are both fully disabled and we help each other do what the other cannot. We work as a team to pick up for each other and are living off of disability income. My brother is recovering from addiction and we're both very proud of him. This is the reason he's currently living with us. He needed a safe place to fall while he got his life together and is 9 months sober. Now my mother and I both have disabilities that make walking and getting up from a sitting position difficult. Recently my mother was informed to use more aids around the house due to a recent hospitalization, we agreed and have gotten a raised toilet seat with handles. My brother absolutely threw a fit over it. He keeps making excuses as to why he hates it and they never match up. First he hated the height of it, His feet don't touch the ground , he could see himself in the mirror and he hates it,  he can't poop on it, there's nowhere to wipe, it hurts his genitals to sit on it. We just kind of ignored the complaints until my mother almost fell getting to the restroom the other night. He has been unscrewing it, removing it, putting our old toilet seat that's been behind the laundry hamper back and using it. He replaces the seat, which is fine but I'm worried about another incident happening of it not being screwed in fully. Both my mother and I have very severe memory issues and we aren't going to remember to check it. When confronted with this he threw his excuses up again and blamed us for ""not being aware of our surroundings"" and that we should check every time we go to the restroom if it's screwed in fully or not. If I fall down that's one thing, but her falling at her age would be much worse.

We have a locked shed out back that he doesn't have access to the key to. I hid his toilet seat with the boxes we have back there and locked it up tight. He hasn't come home yet but I expect backlash.

Side note: It has nothing to do with size. I'm wider than my brother. Both me and my mother are shorter than him and have no issues. She has much less meat on her and the seat is cushioned for her. I think he doesn't like having to use something meant for the disabled or elderly. For those wondering it's the brand Carex RMS Raised toilet seat on Amazon. Was covered by insurance so we had no input but mom loves it. It gives her extra cushion that our old seat lacked. We've looked at seats that move but that doesn't have the stability she or I need.

AITA in this situation for not finding a solution that works for all three?

# Update:

I decided to be the bigger person here and put his toilet seat back in its hiding place in the bathroom where he has it for now. He never came home and noticed it's disappearance (He's gone this weekend) but my Mother was worried about an argument breaking out because my brother is an extremely hot headed person. I'm going to try and sit down with him and find out exactly what it is about the toilet seat that bothers him so badly. If it genuinely is the shape of it or something, I'll find one online that all three of us agree on and it'll be HIS responsibility to buy it since he has the problem. If it's just that he doesn't want to use something meant for the elderly or disabled, I don't know what to tell him. He can't keep taking it off every day because accidents do happen and he's going to forget to tighten it again at some point. Let me reiterate that this has been happening for almost 2 months and I have known the entire time. I didn't have an issue or problem with it until my Mom almost fell. She's my priority, his comfort is not.



I also want to say that my brother is not a freeloader. He does really help us out by living here.

He said I should apologize because I took his stuff without asking and giving it away.

92,1fmh6w4,AITA for canceling my friends car insurance and cell phone when he refused to pay me his share?,"So my friend (D) got in a really bad car accident that killed his adoptive father and seriously injured him to the point where he lost his job. He used the money from the sale of his dads car to buy a car. So I helped him get a job where I used work at a special ed school.

At this time I'm working 2 jobs and going to school at night. So I get call one morning from D saying his car broke down on the way to work and he needs a ride. I tell him to call road side and he says he doesn't have car insurance and starts giving me some long story. I roll my eyes and I go give him a ride.

Later that week I got him to reinstate his car insurance. I don’t know how he thought he was paying them without a bank account but he gave me the cash and we called the insurance company and pay with my card. Problem was that was the same week my card was stolen. I was so flustered I accidentally canceled his payment. He came to my house so upset, and I don’t know why I did it but I offered to put him on my car insurance. IF HE PROMISED TO PAY. The payments would actually be cheaper then his were originally. And I thought everything would be fine. I was wrong.

Shortly after that there was an issue with his cell phone. He couldn’t afford to get a new phone so I added him to my plan and got him the free phone. HE PROMISED TO PAY! Again this would actually be cheaper for him.

Couple months later and I’m hemorrhaging money. My job at the pre-school isn’t giving me the hours they promised so I had to quit and go back to work at the special ed school. Now I work from about 8:30 in the morning, class from 6-8, and clean a bank from 9-11. Just to make ends meet. And guess who I need to shake down for cash every month when bills are due, D.

Couple months later I got job at an assisted living on the weekends, better pay then the bank, so I quit but got D the cleaning job. And I still need to beg him to pay me every month.

So now it’s almost the end of the school year and I wont see D for at least a month until school starts again. AND I AM DONE! I can’t afford my bills. So I told him I’m dropping him. He has 30 days to get his own shit.

29 days later I went to his house to try one more time to get the money from him and explain my situation. He refused to pay. You want to know his reasoning? He smoked me up for free “All the time”.

I just walked away. I canceled his phone line and canceled his car insurance.

Later found out he was ready to sue me if I tried to get the phone back. And he shit talked about me to all his coworkers.

A year later I was in his area and ran into his cousin. She kicked him out for not paying rent a little after I cut him off.

Last I heard he was still working at the school but was living out of a motel and bumming rides from coworkers.

I feel bad his life went so downhill after the accident but I tried so hard to help and all I asked was that he paid his share.

93,1fmggdy,AITA for lying to my friends mother?,"Some background: 

So me (16M) and my friend, Silvia (16F) have been on and off friends ever since we were about 5 years old. We have a complicated history, she used to bully me in primary school and her parents have never really liked me, however, me and Silvia resolved that issue a while ago. Almost 2 years ago now, I invited her to join my friend group since her's fell apart and we've been fine ever since then. 

Okay here's the story:

A months ago I started vaping. I wanted to try it and it ended up helping calm my mind so I decided to keep doing it. A few of my friends, Silvia included, had been vaping for years now and refused to let me vape with them since they had developed addictions to it and they didn't want me to experience that, which I understand. When nobody would let me borrow or hit their vape, I decided I would buy my own and to my surprise, Silvia's attitude completely changed. She was constantly asking to borrow my vape and I didn't mind since I don't use it that much.

A few days ago, Silvia's parents found her vapes in her room and threw them all away. Silvia briefly mentioned this to me on Friday morning when we were having a vape before class and I told her she could borrow it for the day since I had another one. I didn't know she had an out-of-school appointment that day. At lunchtime, I got a text from Silvia on Instagram saying ""Can you come down to the drop-off area."". I was confused since I had just woken up from a nap in class but when I got to the drop-off area I saw Silvia sitting in the back seat of her mum's car.

I walked up to her car and stuck my head through the window. Turns out her mum went through her bag while she was at her appointment. Silvia's mum was holding my vape and asked if it was mine, to which I replied yes and she handed it back to me. She told me that I shouldn't be enabling Silvia, that it was none of her business what I did but if it happened again she would tell my parents. 

Me and Silvia went back inside, she was apologizing to me and I kept telling her it wasn't her fault and she didn't know that her mum was going to go through her bag. As soon as we got to our lunch table, Silvia asked if she could borrow my vape and I just gave it to her since I was still really tired from having pretty much just woken up as well as being a bit out of it from the conversation I just had with my friends mum. 

It's now the weekend and I don't know what to do. I want to try and honour my friends' parents wishes but I also don't want to strain my relationship with Silvia.

A while ago my (27F) sister (30F) told the family she was pregnant. We were all so happy because she had been trying for a few months, and is now finally going to have her first child.

she decided to throw a huge gender reveal party. She was so excited and put a lot of effort into planning everything making sure it was perfect.

 I have never liked parties, no particular reason but every one I had ever been to ended with me bored out of my mind

Half way through the party it’s time to cut the cake and make the big reveal. Everyone was gathered around and that’s when I had the idea to at least attempt to have some fun at this party. 

Right before she was about to cut it, I thought it would be funny to shout, “It’s a boy!” Despite the fact that much like everyone else at the party, I still didn’t know the gender.

 Everyone went silent, and my sister just blankly looked at me (thinking back maybe it was disappointment). She cut the cake and of course, it was a girl. Everyone was shocked and went to congratulate my sister and her husband but my sister didnt cheer, she didn’t hug anyone back, she didn’t even look up from the ground.  

 I was just being playful, but now I’m starting feel a little bit bad for stealing her moment excitement. I’ve tried to explain to her what I was thinking and why I did it but she won’t return my texts or calls. AITA?",Asshole,2024-09-22,"AITA for making a joke at my sisters’s gender reveal party

My girlfriend said yes it’s fine and i of course said yes as well. 
Time went by, and they would constantly ask if it was okay and every time her and i would say yes. We come back from deployment, and about a month later my parents fly up to move in with us but the night prior my gf and i get into a huge argument and she straight up says that she’s unhappy my parents are moving in. I couldn’t just say nvm to my parents as they had already spent an insane amount of money on plane tickets, i reassured her it was gonna be fine and they were going to be a huge help for us in getting a step a head in life by being able to put down over 250k in a house and we wouldn’t have to struggle staying at apartments with shitty neighbors and landlords.

97,1fn673b,AITA: Any Job Worth Doing… ,"Years ago, when I was a young nurse, I had a private client who displayed a gorgeous room screen on her wall. I loved it! She told me about its history and I was obsessed. After almost 30 years, I found one at an antique mall and I had to have it. With a new home and plenty of wall real estate to go around, I couldn’t have been happier. 

One weekend, after church, making a large brunch spread, cleaning, doing dishes and moving in some furniture (while hubs listened to a pod cast in his chair), I asked him if he would help me to hang the screen. He agreed, not too enthusiastically, and I went back to finishing my chores. When at last, I asked if he was ready, he grumbled around, went into the garage, and came back with a giant hammer and 3” nails. 

I wasn’t sure what to say at first, but then asked if he would please hang the screen with screws, because it is quite old and has specific sentimental value as it reminds me of a patient that I cared dearly for. He did some sighing and complaining that a nail would do the job just fine. Then told me to get him the drill, bits, measuring tape, level, yardstick and screws. I was getting irritated, so I said he could relax and I would hang it myself. So he got even grumpier. 

Eventually, it was hung, taking maybe 20 minutes and plenty of husband attitude. Seriously, AITA for asking that the job be done right?

He agreed, not too enthusiastically, and I went back to finishing my chores. When at last, I asked if he was ready, he grumbled around, went into the garage, and came back with a giant hammer and 3” nails. 

I wasn’t sure what to say at first, but then asked if he would please hang the screen with screws, because it is quite old and has specific sentimental value as it reminds me of a patient that I cared dearly for. He did some sighing and complaining that a nail would do the job just fine. Then told me to get him the drill, bits, measuring tape, level, yardstick and screws. I was getting irritated, so I said he could relax and I would hang it myself. So he got even grumpier. 

Eventually, it was hung, taking maybe 20 minutes and plenty of husband attitude. Seriously, AITA for asking that the job be done right? ",3.0,1.0591446161270142,1,0
98,1fn5ohd,AITA for criticising my child's parents?,"I (23M) got my best mate, Damon (19FTM), pregnant. He's clung to me as if i was his entire world ever since, and that only intensified after he gave birth to our daughter a few months ago.

We weren't ready to raise her, Damon a Cambridge drop out and I'm a broke film student. We went with an open adoption, thinking it was the best option for her. Damon has never been able to let go. He still calls her by the name he picked, even though her adoptive parents, Laura and Mark, changed it. He can't stop talking about how she looks like me, like she's this perfect reflection of us.

Whenever we visit, Damon tunes out Laura and Mark. He'll say all the right things to them, acting polite, but he's really just focused on me and the baby. He'll hold her and whisper things like, ""Look at her hair, it's just like yours,"" or ""She's got your eyes, your little smirk."" He completely ignores the fact that she's being raised by other people. Damon hates how perfect and polished Laura and Mark are, he's jealous of the life they're giving her. He's also desperate to have another baby with me. He's convinced it would fix everything, that this time, we'd be be a family. He keeps saying, ""We could do it right this time"" but I keep telling him we're not ready. Damon won't listen. He's convinced having another baby would make everything better.

Last week, it all came to a head. We were visiting Laura and Mark, and as usual, Damon was glued to the baby, still calling her the name we gave her. He was holding her, running his hand through her hair, and said, ""She's going to be tall like Jarvis. She's already got his legs. She's going to grow up lanky and awkward, just like him."" Laura's smile got tighter and tighter, clearly uncomfortable.

Later, Laura pulled me aside. She told me it's ""confusing"" for the baby to have us around like this, and that Damon's not co-operating. She suggested we step back for the baby's sake. That's when I snapped. I told her, ""We agreed on an open adoption. You don't get to shut us out because we don't fit into your perfect life."" Mark chimed in, saying they're just thinking about what's best for the baby, but I pushed back, saying Damon loves that baby more than they'll ever understand.

Damon overheard and broke down afterward. In the car, he was mad, saying, ""You shouldn't have said anything, Jarvis. They'll cut us off now. We need to be grateful."" He's terrified that we'll lose the baby completely, and now he's even more desperate to have another one convinced it's the only way to fix things. It felt right in the moment but a part of me wonders if I've made things worse by standing up to them.

100,1fn56zw,AITA for continuing to change in front of my window even after my neighbor complained?,"I (early 30s F) bought a house last year with my fiancé, but we only just moved in a few months ago because it needed some work.

I was surprised because the angle of the window makes it so that someone would really have to go out of their way to see anything. I checked it out myself, and unless you’re standing in a very specific spot in their yard, you can’t see much at all.

To be clear, no one in her family (husband or son) has ever mentioned seeing me; she was just “worried” that they might. I didn’t feel like I should have to change my habits for her, especially since they’d have to be actively trying to look in. So I kept changing there, as I had been.

Well, she came over again last week, this time freaking out at my fiancé, calling me a “whore” and accusing me of being disrespectful.

102,1fn4s6v,AITA for contacting the HOA about neighbor building a fence over the property line?,"Background, moved into a new dvlpment subdivision 2 years ago, built home next to builder display.  In Dec last year, builder sells the display home to new owners.  I haven’t really met them formally, just a couple friendly waves and hellos as we are coming and going

In June, out of the blue, a dump truck has dumped a load of gravel in my front yard.  Builder says it wasn’t their truck, so I post in the neighborhood FB group and call HOA and city to figure it out.  Either city or HOA, but one tells me that the new neighbor is getting a pool.

I knock on neighbors door and only son was home.  I ask him to have one of parents stop by and could they please arrange for the rock to be removed from my yard

Neighbor never came by to introduce themselves or apologized but after a day or two the contractor gets most of the gravel removed.

Fast forward 4 months and the pool project still going on, and I have had to keep an eye on the contractor constantly to not tear up my yard.  3 weeks ago they put up a fence around yard.   I think to myself, that is pretty close to the property line and they weren’t using a professional installer but 3 guys in a truck.  I get a survey done and sure enough 2/3 of the fence is 1 to 3 inches over the property line.

I reached out to city to see if permit is still open and drop a line to the HOA just to keep them in loop.  City says will not close permit without a remedy and HOA says will reach out to homeowner to ask them to contact me – maybe important or not, neighbor has never given me a phone number or email to reach them.   On Wednesday, the next day after I got the formal survey, I try to knock on neighbor’s door again to let them know of fence issue and no answer.

Finally on Saturday, I am able to catch neighbor at home.  I was a little taken aback when neighbor was pissed that I called the HOA, as they had received the email.  They said I was being unfriendly to do that and I should have contacted them directly first.  I explained that I had indeed reached out but never was able to catch them at home.  I proceeded to offer my phone number and a copy of the survey.  They did not reciprocate with a phone number – oh well.

I guess they are living rent-free in my head a bit, but also have to live next them for the next how many years.

103,1fn4ovf,AITA for being furious at my friend for involving herself in my relationship despite me telling her not to?,"Last week, I (23F) received a message from an anonymous Instagram account claiming my boyfriend (23M) of 5 months is a liar and a cheater. This shocked me because I finally feel I can trust someone and work through my past traumas.

I asked the account for proof but didn’t get a reply right away. When they eventually responded, they only mentioned personal details about my boyfriend, like his “dick curves to the left” and that he’s “dominant in bed.” This wasn’t proof, so I requested actual evidence, but instead, they attacked me personally, calling me names like “ugly” and “insecure.”

I suspect this is his ex trying to stir drama. My boyfriend has been reassuring throughout, even offering to let me look through his phone. I trust my instincts, and there’s no solid evidence to suggest he’s lying.

Throughout this, I kept my best friend (23F) updated and specifically asked her not to contact his ex. However, she ignored my request and texted her anyway, saying, “I’m sorry, you’re going to hate me, but I texted her.” I was furious and told her she crossed a serious boundary, dragging someone into a situation they might not even be involved in. I told her that if my boyfriend broke up with me over this, our friendship would be over.

I know my reaction was wrong; I was angry and triggered by past experiences. My friend and I have had many arguments recently, including one during a trip to Paris that left me feeling panicked and frustrated.

Interestingly, what the ex-girlfriend said about their relationship mostly confirmed what my boyfriend had told me. She expressed her insecurities and admitted she had no proof of any cheating.

I apologized to my friend, acknowledging my harsh words. She claimed she needs space now, and her sister and boyfriend unfollowed me on Instagram. She deleted all our photos together and has cut me out of her life.

I feel like I might have ruined our friendship, even though I wasn’t the one who crossed the boundary first. While I regret saying I’d end our friendship, I also feel betrayed by her actions. I understand she might have thought she was helping, but it wasn’t her place to involve herself without my consent, especially when I was already dealing with a lot of stress.

104,1fn4n92,WIBTAH? Intimacy problems due to medication ,"My boyfriend (27 M) and I (22 F) are in a very new relationship. I don’t have much relationship experience due to loosing a partner to suicide when I was a teen. I’ve done a lot of coping and growing from that relationship, and I finally find myself “ready” to give it a shot again. Being with my current boyfriend has really changed my outlook on love and relationships in general. But, we are facing a problem that I don’t really know how to ask other people in my life for advice about. 

My boyfriend struggles with hair loss. It’s not something that bothers me on any level, but I know it really bothers him. He is taking a medication to combat his hair loss, but there are some side effects. 

Since starting the medication, he has been struggling to perform. I know I can do things by myself, but I want him to be included. But he is also contemplating not taking the medication, which I know will be incredibly hard for him. 

Would I be the asshole if I brought up being unsatisfied with our sex life? I want him to feel confident about his appearance, but a healthy sex life is important to me in a relationship. 

What I really need advice on is if he keeps taking the medication, what can I do to have us both feel included and satisfied in more intimate moments (all poly/enm situations are off the table). If he does stop taking the medication, how can I support him and make him feel as attractive as I think he is?

Any advice at all would be appreciated!

106,1fn4ajm,WIBTA if I informed on my hoarder friend? I am worried and unsure how to proceed.,"A little background: many years ago I dated a guy. Things ended, not terribly, but we fell out of touch. After about 10 years and we recently reconnected over social media and decided to catch up in person (again, as friends). Now when we dated, he lived in a large home with a lot of collections spread around. Nothing too overbearing, it was fun pop culture stuff, I even contributed a few items. He is currently in a nice (in theory) apartment. It's not huge but it's fine for one person. I walked in and was shocked. It was everything that you see on hoarder shows. 
He had to walk on paths thru items, squeeze through halls, there were leaning stacks of magazines, etc. Don't get me wrong it wasn't dirty, but clearly not a good situation. At some point I realized that this was not a studio apt as I initially thought, but it was a one bedroom with so much crap in there that he is sleeping in the living room because he can't get into the bedroom. I was shocked when I realized this and he laughed and said yeah. Like it was cool, he just has a lot of stuff. 
This used to be a social guy who would have friends over but now he can't because there is literally no place to sit. An old friend of his that we used to socialize with passed by with his wife to say hello, and he actually had them standing on the sidewalk for the entire visit of like 40 minutes. I should add he also has 2 storage units. Like full room rental storage, not a little cage in the basement. His car is an extension of the house with the amount of items in it. 
This was a week ago and I can't get the situation out of mind. I know technically it is really none of my business but this is a good guy and I care about his well being. How do I go about this? Do I have the hard conversation with him, knowing that he trusted me to come into his place even though I am no longer really a person in his life? Do I reach out to his family? Say nothing? I need some advice and I can't really ask the people around me because they remember him, and I have no desire to embarrass him or rob him of his privacy.

He is currently in a nice (in theory) apartment. It's not huge but it's fine for one person. I walked in and was shocked. It was everything that you see on hoarder shows. 
He had to walk on paths thru items, squeeze through halls, there were leaning stacks of magazines, etc. Don't get me wrong it wasn't dirty, but clearly not a good situation. At some point I realized that this was not a studio apt as I initially thought, but it was a one bedroom with so much crap in there that he is sleeping in the living room because he can't get into the bedroom. I was shocked when I realized this and he laughed and said yeah. Like it was cool, he just has a lot of stuff. 
This used to be a social guy who would have friends over but now he can't because there is literally no place to sit. An old friend of his that we used to socialize with passed by with his wife to say hello, and he actually had them standing on the sidewalk for the entire visit of like 40 minutes. I should add he also has 2 storage units. Like full room rental storage, not a little cage in the basement. His car is an extension of the house with the amount of items in it. 
This was a week ago and I can't get the situation out of mind. I know technically it is really none of my business but this is a good guy and I care about his well being. How do I go about this? Do I have the hard conversation with him, knowing that he trusted me to come into his place even though I am no longer really a person in his life? Do I reach out to his family? Say nothing? I need some advice and I can't really ask the people around me because they remember him, and I have no desire to embarrass him or rob him of his privacy. ",1.0,1.0473356246948242,1,1

I am a 32(f) I just had a baby girl back in august. The father of my child 42(m) and I broke up 4 months into my pregnancy due to him not being faithful fast forward 3 months later he gets a gf and they move in together from what he told me. She then called my phone out of the nowhere 8:00pm at night telling me f*** me and my daughter until the DNA test comes back. I then blocked him from calling me and only communicated with him via facebook messenger. I told him I had no problem giving him a dna test for our daughter and even offered to do the non-invasive one while I was pregnant but he declined. I also invited him to the birth of my daughter and he had every excuse why he couldn’t come. After being released from the hospital I took my daughter to get the dna test done and still he has yet to go do his part even though the test has been paid for. I also told him his gf is not allowed around our daughter because she seems not too happy about our daughter existence. He then proceeds to tell me in order for him to have a relationship with our daughter his gf has to have one with her as well. I’ve also proposed that we all meet up because maybe she’s not a bad person. He’s declined that. I’ve also bought everything that she has needed since he said he wouldn’t do anything until the DNA test comes back. So now he’s claiming I won’t let him see her but I’ve told him he can without the gf since we can’t meet. So am I the asshole for setting this guideline ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-22,"AITA for not letting my daughter around his gf

108,1fn3aeo,AITA for losing my cool with a teacher and my classmates?,"Hi all,

I’m in a class where we have different guest lecturers each day. Not ideal but it is what it is. A few of us have asked for a common thread so the lecturers know what we’ve already covered, but the school hasn’t really taken this request seriously.

This morning, some students started complaining again, and I kinda lost my patience—but I still tried to stay polite. I asked the teacher if she knew what we studied the day before, and she admitted she didn’t. I pointed out that we had already covered a very similar topic and even offered to share the document. Instead, she asked for a specific definition, and when my answer didn’t satisfy her, she implied I didn’t know what I was talking about. A few other students jumped in to clarify, but most of the class just wanted to stay on this lesson.

What frustrates me is that without a follow up, the classes are slow and repetitive. Some students don’t take notes or the class seriously, which makes everything drag on.

We’ve already raised these concerns with the administration, and I even emailed the teacher afterward to clear up any misunderstandings, but she never replied. To make things worse, she taught the class from a noisy café (we’re remote, so that’s fine, but it was distracting), started with a blank page she filled in as she went, and let us out early, which felt like she wasn’t prepared or interested.

I’m frustrated with myself for losing my cool, but with only 2 hours left of class, I couldn’t message her to explain. I’m also disappointed with my classmates—they don’t seem to care about making things run smoothly, so I’m at the point where I just want to focus on myself.

One classmate, who I thought I was close to, messaged me saying I was rude for speaking up. After I explained the situation, she apologized, but it took a 15-minute conversation to get there.

Anyway, I’m just done with the whole situation but it seems some people spoke behind my back. Was I the AITA?",Not enough info,2024-09-22,"AITA for losing my cool with a teacher and my classmates? Hi all,
