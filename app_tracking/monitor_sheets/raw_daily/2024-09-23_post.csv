0,1fntxji,AITA for trying to print a (kinda) risqué image at a library?,"This is rather a case of AITC - Am I The Creep?

I (25M) am a traditional painter, and for a next piece I wanted to paint from a reference photo. Said photo features a mid shot of a woman (from the waist up) wearing no shirt or bra but having her arms in front of her chest, holding a flower, obscuring her bare breasts/nipples. The photo and her look make it obvious that it is risqué/sensual, but it's far from anything you'd call pornographic. You could post it on a social media website or put it on TV.

I usually print at a regular place, but I was already out in the city so I decided to save some time and find a place nearby. There were no printing shops near me, but there was a library so I decided to try my chance there, since I know all libraries have such facilities. But it wasn't a public library, it belonged to a University.

At the front desk was a young woman, and I asked if I could possibly print 1 A3 paper in color, offering to pay for it. She was very friendly and helpful, she said I can do it for free if it's just one, and logged me in a computer there. I was very grateful, and went to my email address where the photo was saved. When she saw the picture, she asked ""Okay, is that what you want to print""? I said ""Yes"", but she quickly took the mouse and started closing the tabs saying something like ""This is, no -- C'mon man, this isn't a public library. No..-"" She was still polite and her tone wasn't angry, but vey flustered.

Realizing how this looks, I tried to smile it off and say ""I intend to paint this, it's a reference photo."" But she was visibly embarrassed and just wanted to end the situation. ""this is so inappropriate, can I ask you to leave, please"" she continued.

I got quite embarrassed too, and said ""I'm really sorry, I'm not a creep"" which is a sentence that never sounds good. There was a lot more awkward stuttering from both of us, but it was obvious the situation was unsalvageable. I got my things quickly and prepared to leave. I said ""I'm really sorry for creeping you out like this"" one last time before leaving. As I was walking up the steps towards the door, she was following close behind, and as soon as I was out she went to a colleague working at a different desk, no doubt telling him about the encounter.

I feel very awkward and like a total weirdo, but it didn't even cross my mind that anyone would take offence to that image which (to me) is rather mild. Usually when I print such things at shops no one bats an eye",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITA for trying to print a (kinda) risqué image at a library? This is rather a case of AITC - Am I The Creep?

2,1fnte9o,AITA for telling my girlfriend it's gross that she doesn't always wash her hair?,"I 23M have been dating 23F for just under a year. We both play intramural soccer, so I came over to her apartment after our practice ended, and noticed her hair was dry so I asked if she wanted me to cook something while she showered. She said she already had. Practice is very taxing and I'm always drenched in sweat after, I can't imagine not washing my hair, especially since she has much longer thicker hair than me. I told her this, and she said she can't wash her hair every time she showers or it would fall out, or become dry/brittle.

I wash my hair every time I shower, not just when I workout. I shower almost every day unless I did nothing all day, then I don't see a reason. But if I leave my house at all, I will shower, and if I shower I wash my hair.

She only washes her hair twice a week and said she tries to line it up with practice days, but it doesn't always work out. She also showers every other day, which I understand because she's much less active than me generally. She works from home, and her other hobbies are indoor activities, and she's more of a homebody. But since she's showering less, I feel like that's even more reason she should wash her hair every time she does shower.

EDIT: Ok y'all I'm TA. I think I made this seem more dramatic than it was tho, this was a casual conversation, and we playfully rib each other.

I brought it up again, and she said a lot of the stuff you guys mentioned, it takes a long time to dry, too much washing makes it frizzy, and she doesn't find it gets dirty that quickly. I've never noticed it looking dirty or smelling bad, I guess I just assumed everyone else on the planet operated in the same way as me, lol, I realise this is also my bad, but this has never come up with anyone else before, I just thought everyone washed their hair every day. One thing I didn't see mentioned that she brought up is if she washed her hair every day she'd go through shampoo and conditioner like 5x as fast, and it's very expensive, so that's another factor that I never considered.

3,1fnt2jh,AITA for telling my friend not to continue dating a specific man? ,"My friend (34f) went on a date recently, at a riverside restaurant and according to her the date was great.  Great conversation, like instant chemistry.  After dinner he recommended for them to walk the wooded lit river paths to continue the date, but she declined stating that last time she was out there, she got destroyed by mosquitoes.  He insisted it would be fine, but she held her ground explaining that mosquitoes really love her for some reason.  She recommended walking the town a bit instead even though the shops were mostly closed, but he declined and they agreed to be in touch to set up their next date later. 

He talked to her the next day explaining he was really sad they didn't walk the water, because the night was magical and he has envisioned how wonderful and romantic it would be by the water.  She stated she agreed but mosquitoes had other ideas.  He went on to further explain the idea he had in his head, and his words became more and more snippy, like she was too dense to understand.  Based on the words she described to me, he was frustrated at the missed opportunity and maybe wanted an apology (which she did not give)?  And ended the conversation with an exasperated line like ""well I won't try and be romantic next time"".

My comments were that a scenario where you are uncomfortable and likely in pain tomorrow isn't an ideal fantasy.  He has an idea in his head that he wanted no matter what, regardless of your feelings or knowing you'd get hurt.  That this is an immediate red flag, considering how annoyed he's getting that you don't ""get it"".  That she was somehow in the wrong for saying no. Like bro we get it, it sounded lovely, but her opinions matter too and it should only be an ideal romance if both parties are happy and comfortable. 

So here's where I may be the AH.  I told her it's a huge red flag and not to pursue him, that he can't respect her saying no if it doesn't align with what he wants.  Explaining about how controlling his actions were and disrespectful of your input.  That your literal bodily harm didn't come before his preference.  My friend got snippy with me that she hasn't had a date in three years despite trying and that I have ""pretty girl"" privilege and that I don't understand that she can't be picky.  I retorted that I'd rather her be single forever then with a man that would harm her so the evening can be perfect for him.

Am I over stepping?  She vented it to me for a reason, because he made her uncomfortable.  I think my comment about wanting her to be single was harsh and maybe over stepping and I do plan to apologize for not being more eloquent.  but I wanted to really drive home the importance of avoiding red flags.

5,1fnsprb,AITA for falsely accusing a classmate of using ai?,"So I go to art school and it's my senior year. One of my classes is a digital art class, and it's mostly other seniors with a couple juniors and one freshman.

The other day we had our critique for our first project. Keep in mind that we've had weeks to work on this. I spent around 20 hours on mine and I'm pretty proud of the result. I got good feedback during critique, and most of my classmates did too; everyone clearly worked really hard. Except for the freshman.

She's pretty shy so she ended up going last. Her piece was ok but it seemed like she didn't put a lot of work into it, and the more I looked at it, the more suspicious I became. There wasn't a very clear style and the background wasn't fleshed out very well, but most importantly, the hands were very poorly drawn, which is usually a dead giveaway for AI generated art.

I mentioned this in a non-accusatory way: I just said the hands in particular look like they could be AI generated. She got really upset and said that none of it was AI generated, she spent hours on it, and that it was a really rude comment. I said that I thought it was unfair that everyone else put in so much effort, and she clearly didn't. At this point she ran out of the class crying. It was really awkward and my professor asked me to stay after class.

She said that my comments were uncalled for and that just because I didn't like her piece, I shouldn't have made such a serious accusation. (The professor has a policy against using AI for the class.) She asked me to reach out and apologize to my classmate. I agreed, but I feel like I don't really owe her an apology. 

Critique is meant to be helpful, and I think it was disrespectful of her to waste everyone's time by presenting that. Even if she didn't use AI, it still just wasn't very good, and as a freshman, she has to learn how to take critique eventually.",Asshole,2024-09-23,"AITA for falsely accusing a classmate of using ai?

My sleeping schedule is messy compared to theirs, in a way that sometimes I spend the whole night awake drawing (which is my freelance job).

In the past months his children started complaining and wanting us out of the house for a lot of reasons, most of them agreed by my mom and my stepfather to be unreasonable/cultural shock. One of the biggest complains towards me specifically (which I do agree is bothersome) is that I make noise when I'm in a voice call with my friend(s).

I have ADHD and don't speak to my family because they ""don't believe in ADHD"" and neglected to help me throughout my childhood so it was rough and they were pretty shitty to me. I got a diagnosis at 20 after losing several jobs and flunking out of high school and struggling to stay afloat. The diagnosis really changed my life. I was able to get my GED at 23. Didn't do great but way better than I ever did in school.

Tillie and I met before I completed it and she saw me at some of my worst points. I met her family 3 years ago and instantly recognized her nephew (now 7) was showing signs of ADHD. She had picked up on it too but her brother and SIL were against getting him evaluated. She told me they would not be receptive to me speaking to them so I left it alone. But whenever we were around we did our best to show him understanding that his parents struggled to show.

He was formally diagnosed in March after his current and former teacher reached out together and expressed concerns with his ability to concentrate and his struggles with staying still. Other family members told Tillie's brother and SIL they should really seek the eval so they could know once and for all. But they believe ADHD is used to ""excuse bad behavior"" and excuse poor planning and consideration (not paying attention). So they don't want him on meds or in therapy. Tillie's nephew struggles with school and with not breaking things. He has so much energy and he's always running and he bumps into things, loses focus and he drops stuff or misuses them without meaning to. This annoys his parents and they choose to discipline like he doesn't have ADHD instead of helping. They believe he'll learn that ADHD can't excuse stuff.

Members of the family have spoken up and Tillie and I did together but were quickly dismissed. Someone from CPS actually visited because of the refusal to accept any therapy/meds but did not intervene. They're still pissed about it.

Instead of rocking the boat with them too much, I decided to just be a safe space for Tillie's nephew and I let him talk to me about it because he knows I also have ADHD. His parents don't like this. They get pissed when they hear him tell me stuff about the trouble he has. They say I'm letting him dwell on it instead of him learning how to accept he can't use ADHD as an excuse.

Instead of rocking the boat with them too much, I decided to just be a safe space for Tillie's nephew and I let him talk to me about it because he knows I also have ADHD. His parents don't like this. They get pissed when they hear him tell me stuff about the trouble he has. They say I'm letting him dwell on it instead of him learning how to accept he can't use ADHD as an excuse.

8,1fns0g6,AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s child-free wedding after she asked me not to bring my baby?,"My (34F) sister (29F) is getting married in three months. She’s having a child-free wedding, which I totally respect. My husband (35M) and I have a 3-month-old baby. When my sister first told us about the child-free situation, I assumed there would be some flexibility for immediate family, especially newborns who can’t be left alone.

I talked to my sister and asked if we could bring our baby to the ceremony, explaining I am breastfeeding and we don’t feel comfortable leaving our baby with someone for an entire day. We have to fly into the town where she is getting married (and we don't know anyone there) so we would have to leave the baby with a stranger there, or leave the baby back home with someone we know for a long period of time. I am quite anxious about being away from our newborn for too long, which my sister knows.

To my surprise, my sister was adamant that no children, including our baby, would be allowed at the wedding. She said it wouldn’t be fair to make an exception for us when other guests are also not allowed to bring their kids. I asked if we could at least bring the baby for the ceremony and leave afterward, but she said no, explaining she wants a strict no-kids atmosphere the entire day.

I told her that if our baby couldn’t come, we’d likely skip the wedding because it’s too hard to leave our newborn for such a long stretch of time. We thought about the idea of just having my husband attend, but that also seemed a bit strange too. I also don't want to just leave the baby with my husband and go by myself. My sister got very upset with me, saying it’s her special day, and she feels like I’m putting our baby above her wedding. She even hinted that I should figure out how to ""detach"" from the baby for just a few days and that we should understand how important this event is for her.

Maybe I am being unreasonable for not willing to leave my baby behind, but I just feel like I should be there for my baby at all times (plus I know how anxious I am gonna feel that entire day). My sister’s argument is that it’s her wedding and her rules, and while I respect that, I also think she should be more understanding of our situation.

9,1fnroia,AITA for swearing in front of my nieces and for criticizing their parent's leniency?,"This will be long, sorry. I'll start by saying I love my nieces (7F twins, wife's sister's children) but they're challenging.

Two weeks ago the whole family took them to the theater. After the movie, we decided to go for coffee, got sweets for them and coffee for us, each cup had a shot glass of sparkling water, actual glass not plastic.

One of my nieces sat next to me and started playing with empty shot glasses, spinning them on their side and stacking them up. I said stop, said she could break those and get hurt. She kept on, I told her to stop again, so did her mother. I took the glasses from her.

She moved to her father's side on the other end of the table, across from my wife. Went at it again with empty glasses over there. BIL did nothing. I told her to stop from afar, she stacked them. My wife was worried it would break as it was pretty unstable, told niece to stop, tried to take them away but the stack collapsed, 2 glasses hit the floor and broke. At least nobody was hurt.

SIL scolded my niece, BIL said it was't niece, it was my wife's fault. SIL apologizes to niece and jokingly scolds my wife.

I didn't think it was funny and asked what do you mean ""my wife's fault""? Niece was told to stop multiple times by different people, had glasses taken from her and went to get more but you just sat there. My wife tried to take those away before anyone got hurt and it's her fault?

BIL says my wife touched it last, which really pushed me over. I said ""this isn't fucking Jenga"". Way i see, it doesn't matter who touched it last, niece should have stopped it when told to. If anything it was BIL's fault for not doing anything after niece didn't heed others. BIL and SIL both got cross with me, hadn't heard from them since.

Wife says her sister and BIL talked to her and expect me to apologize for swearing in front of the girls and for judging how they raise them and that our invitation to nieces' birthday party next month is pending on my apology.

Wife says I'm the asshole: they're not my kids to discipline, it didn't bother her to be blamed and she wants to go to the party; I should just admit I'm wrong and say sorry. Wife's parents were there at the time, they think I was right and are glad someone said it, but won't get involved as they can't risk being uninvited.

I'm going to apologize anyway so my wife goes to the party. I still don't think I'm the asshole, but maybe I overdid it (suppose I shouldn't swear in front of children). My patience is running out with my nieces' terrible behavior though and their parents leniency, but they're barely 7 and I don't have kids so what do I know? Am I the asshole?

We have our mutual friend we’ve known for years, A (31M). He agreed to live for 2 years, until the end of May '25, and with a roommate (another friend of ours) they pay rent about $400 each, just enough to cover the house expense. For 3 bedroom + basement in West Toronto, 3mins away from a station, it is a very friendly price. But again it was a win-win situation for everyone, because my MIL and ourselves were always welcomed whenever we were in town, as a part of the deal. 

*There is no legal lease or agreement written.

Our plan changed when I got pregnant. We weren't doing well in the isolation in Japan, and decided to go back to Toronto sooner. 

My husband told A that he was going back to Toronto beforehand. However A seemed very upset when he found out that I was also coming back as well. “NGL you guys shouldn’t be together.” He knew that we were fighting a lot, and told us to stay out of the house for the time being. A recently lost his job and his gf. He is going through a hard time, and perhaps he was afraid that we might bring more negativity and stress, although it was opposite of our intention to come back.

We had a back up plan which was to stay at my FIL’s house outside of Toronto. He welcomed us despite the surprise visit. He told us to stay while he is away, and that is why we are still here after a month. 

We visited MIL's house and told them the news. We basically told them that we would like to come back to Toronto sooner than we originally thought, but our intention is not to kick them out. We wanted an open conversation with everyone. 

B had an idea to live altogether for a transitioning period of time. I initially refused the idea as I could not picture living with others when the baby was born. (Due on March '25) A also rejected the idea. 

A week later, I visited A & B. I wanted to check in, but also wanted to reassure them that we are not expecting an immediate action. B told me that he is willing to look for a new place as soon as his current project ends. A seemed upset, and I suggested an idea to subsidize his new apartment rent for the remaining time. A said no. He reminded me that he is currently jobless, and unlikely to find a new job soon. Therefore he doesn't want to think about housing until he finds a job. I asked if he considers getting back to food delivery. He said that is not a real job.

I then suggested to live altogether for a while, the idea I initially refused to take. A again refused, saying that it was not in the agreement and is concerned about potential conflicts. Our conflicts being the housing issue, and A's reaction made me question our friendship.

We've been living together for about two years now, and everything has been going pretty smoothly. We split rent, utilities, and chores, and we generally get along.

Recently, Jake's girlfriend, Sarah (24F), has been staying over more and more. It started with the occasional night, but now she’s here almost every day. She uses our kitchen, takes up a lot of space in the living room, and leaves her stuff everywhere. I didn't really say anything at first because I didn't want to cause any drama, but it's starting to feel like she's living here without contributing.

A few weeks ago, Jake told me that Sarah is thinking of moving out of her place and asked if she could move in with us. He suggested splitting the rent three ways, but I'm not really comfortable with it. The dynamic has already shifted with her around so much, and I feel like my space is being taken over. Plus, I didn't sign up for living with a couple when I agreed to be Jake’s roommate.

I told Jake I wasn’t cool with Sarah moving in, and he got upset, saying I was being unfair. He argued that it would help with rent and that Sarah already spends most of her time here, so it wouldn’t make much of a difference. I disagreed and said it’s different having someone officially living here. Now things are tense between us, and Sarah has been cold towards me too.

I get that it might make things easier for them, but I just don’t want to share my living space with a couple. Jake thinks I’m being unreasonable, so I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for not agreeing to let her move in.

She is starting to avoid my mom and wanting nothing to do with her, and i’m torn in the middle. My fiancee and mother are completely different women as far as personality, but they have always gotten along. Nothing between them specifically happened, but my fiancee dropped the bomb last night on how she can’t take seeing my mom anymore. 

My mom and her dad live in the same city 4 hours away from us so we only visit 3-4 times a year. My mom expects us as company when we do visit, and it’s been this way since we dated. This arrangement never seemed to bother my fiancee until now. But again, my mom is anti social and also has my adult siblings and 2 yo nephew living with her so she’s quite busy. We hosted a wedding dinner in our parents city and my mom didn’t come to meet her side of the family, while she had members fly in from out of state. My mom had to watch my nephew so she declined, but kindly invited us over to her home that same night. That infuriated my fiancee. She said “why would I visit your moms house after she ignored our night”

There was another time she had a nursing graduation party at my FILS and my family didn’t come but was invited. That made her upset and just added to the “they don’t care” about stuff we have going on. She can’t fathom that my family doesn’t have to show up to anything for us, but she’s expected to visit there when we do finally see eachother. That’s honestly the only way I get to see my family, they are homebodies. She told me it’s embarrassing to constantly explain this to her side of the family.

Well, my fiancées mom passed away this summer and we visited my mom last month and that was the icing on the cake for my fiancée. She told me once we got home she was greatly offended that my mom couldn’t ask her how she’s been doing, hug her, or even share her condolences upon visiting. She told me she’s exhausted because she’s the only one that seems to GAF. She asked me if my mom even knew her mom passed away and I told her I mentioned it when she passed. She told me she’s tired of being expected to visit when my mom clearly doesn’t reciprocate visits, or ask about her wellbeing. 

I don’t understand why my fiancée can’t lower her expectations because I told her my mom is just a shy person. She doesn’t believe me because it’s not fair “the expectations fall on her” and my mom gets a pass to be unempathetic and low effort in our lives. She also mentioned my mom hasn’t anknowleged or asked about the wedding and she just has a list of what my mom hasn’t done. My in-laws are far more supportive and close as a family so we spend the majority with them anyway.

14,1fnpdsq,WIBTAH if I asked my roommate to return his dog to the shelter?,"I prayed to God I would never have to post here, but I need advice and some sort of assurance that I’m doing the right thing. For the sake of privacy, I’m going to be using fake names.

For a bit of context: I (27FtM) moved out of my old place with two roommates after we agreed that we as people (and our careers) were going different directions. I then moved in with Rob (25FtM), a partner of one of my coworkers. I moved across the coast to get away from a bad family situation and had nowhere to go back to, so Rob stepped in and offered I take over the other half of his current roommate’s lease.

Before moving in and after, I expressed a desire to have felines in the house. I’d been wanting a cat for years and now, faced with the opportunity of finally having my own, I asked Bruce if I could get a cat or two. To which he agreed. I brought home two young cats (8mo and 4mo) about two weeks ago, paid the pet deposit and everything and so far everything was peachy.

Here’s the problem:

About a week ago, Rob was watching tiktoks about shelter animals and expressed a desire to go and visit some of the animals there. Me, being a big animal enthusiast myself, agreed. Not just to see some cute pups and kitties, but to gain access to resources for my new furbabies, such as information on needed vaccines or possibly volunteering.

Now, Rob has expressed to me in the past that he’s wanted a service animal for a while to assist him with his disabilities both physical and mental. And assured me that he would just be browsing and looking at animals (mistake number one on my end). However, I was shocked to learn that in the 30-40 minutes of me parting from him to look at some of the cats for adoption, Rob had impulsively chosen to adopt one of the big dogs while I was away.

I’ll call him Brownie.

I was not asked if he could adopt Brownie and no discussion was held beforehand. Whereas with the cats, we’d discussed several times before, during and after my move. So certain to say, I was a bit miffed. But our mutual friends and his partner seemed REALLY happy for him and therefore, I felt that I should be, too.

The problem is, my apartment complex only allows two animal slots per apartment, and with Rob’s agreement, my cats took up both slots. Unless he registered Brownie as a service animal, Brownie was not welcome to stay.

Brownie, I’ve found, also did not have a personality assessment that told me whether or not he was friendly with cats or other small animals and judging from looking at him, he has traits that suggest he has attributes from several breeds of HIGH energy dog. Regardless, Rob assured me he could handle Brownie and would put all of that energy into his training. 

However, I expressed concerns about having Brownie and my cats in the same apartment together. As my girls had gone from having free reign of a majority of the apartment to being crammed in my bedroom, I was (again) assured that the girls and Brownie would take turns having the apartment to themselves. Feeling guilty and wanting to trust Rob due to him opening up about some trauma and telling me he’d had a past in training animals, including Service Animals, I agreed again.

Here’s where I know I’ll probably be TAH:

Brownie came home on Friday, cone on his head from being neutered, jittery but otherwise happy to be there. It was clear to me that he was very attached to Rob, as he would follow Rob around the house and pant and whimper whenever Brownie couldn’t see Rob. Typical behavior to expect from a shelter animal, there’s always a bit of that separation anxiety at first. However, Rob warned me that apparently Brownie was doing some resource guarding. Brownie also didn’t like his back being touched, panicked when hands moved out of his range of sight and darted for my bedroom door every time I opened it to get inside and take care of the girls.

Rob spent our weekend training Brownie and called out of work to spend extra time with him to try and make his return to work easier on Brownie. Yesterday, a friend came over to watch over him for us while I worked later than usual so he wouldn’t be alone.

This morning, however, Rob had gone to work and I had woken up late. While getting ready for work, I heard Brownie whining and barking in spite of being told he had been given some calming treats and some music being turned on for him in Rob’s room. I soothed him through the door so he knew I was in the house and resumed getting ready for work. When I came out into the living room, though, there was debris all over the place. And when I had opened up the door to Rob’s room to check on Brownie, Brownie had ripped up an entire corner of carpet, knocked down Rob’s PC, had several accidents on the floor, eaten some of the trim on the door, I was mortified.

I knew Brownie had some separation anxiety, but this was far more extreme than I knew Rob and I could handle.

I’m terrified of possibly being evicted by my apartment complex, I haven’t even been living here a month. I have nowhere else to go and I pooled all of my savings just to live here and to take care of my cats. I know Rob can’t afford to leave, but he has it in his head that he can somehow train this out of Brownie. It hasn’t even been three days since he’s come home.

I don’t blame Brownie for being scared, he’s a sweet dog, but I don’t think Rob has the time, the money or the resources to care for Brownie and help him through his anxiety right now. It’s not fair to the dog. He needs help, love and assistance that he won’t be able to get in an apartment complex like this.

Rob has to come home early from work, and he’s not getting by without a discussion with me. I know I’m just as at fault for letting it go on this long. But I know Brownie can’t stay.

15,1fnpaug,UPDATE: AITA for coming to my brother's wedding with an invitation?,"Hello again, Reddit. It's been four days since I posted about my brother's wedding that I was 'invited' to but not welcome at. I didn't expect to receive this many comments on my post. Even though I received the 'NTA judgement', I do believe many of you said I was the a-hole overall, and I'm willing to accept that. I didn’t intend to withhold important information to tilt the verdict in my favor, in fact, I appreciate so many people holding me accountable for my irresponsible behavior.

For those who have not read my first post, here's the link: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fktd45/aita\_for\_coming\_to\_my\_brothers\_wedding\_with\_an/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1fktd45/aita_for_coming_to_my_brothers_wedding_with_an/)

I did not reach out to my brother after the post. While I was considering sending a letter at some point or maybe indirectly sending a message through someone he trusts more than me, it was not necessary because as it turns out: my brother isn't as passive anymore as I thought he was.

Last night, I received an email from him (and his husband), apologizing for the incident at the wedding and explaining why it happened. Their MC (who is also a good friend of theirs) had not communicated my last-minute decision to attend their wedding, which is why my presence caught my brother off guard. He admitted to not being ready to see me, even though my intentions weren't bad. Thankfully, the incident was something he was able to forget during the day, and only been nagging on him a few days after, which is why he sent the email.

I responded with a brief apology on my part and I said I would keep my distance from now on. I added that if he ever feels the need to talk to me, he can reach out to me whenever, but that I will not force a relationship between us anymore.

I want to thank everyone for their honest judgement, advice and questions. This has been a hard but necessary wake-up call. While I’m still processing a lot of it, I’ve realized that the work on myself is far from over. My priority now is to keep focusing on personal growth and to respect my brother's boundaries. Whether we reconnect or not is up to him, and I have to be okay with that. Thanks again to everyone for helping me see things more clearly. Take care.

Edit: Just to clarify the things I left out in the original post: I didn't RSVP in time, but my sister made sure I was still able to attend, but it still caused confusion and stress at the wedding. Yes, I was homophobic to my brother in the past, and I deeply regret the pain I caused him. And yes, I’m still struggling with my own sexuality, which is something I didn’t want to openly discuss in the first post.

My major has a cohort of 15 people and we all have the same classes, so naturally we all got relatively close very quickly.  All of us would study together in each other rooms, go to the gym, eat at our dining commons, etc.  I got close with the guys in my cohort quickly because they were more open to talking and I found a lot of similarities with them. Soon enough, my main friend group was mostly guys. When I would tell my boyfriend what I was doing, he would always ask me who I am with.  Whenever I would tell him I was with my guy friends by their names, his response was usually ""With two guys?"" Lot of passive aggression and when I would ask him what is wrong he would always say ""its fine"".  We actually started talking about it and he said that he doesn't trust men but has complete trust in me but will not allow to be in their rooms at all and limit my time with them.  I am a big advocator for not changing your platonic relationships because of your romantic one, but I think it is having a big toll on us.

22,1fno1t8,AITA for asking to be acknowledged?,"I (35 f) have been dating BF (37 m) for just over 2 years now. On Thursday, I presented a project I've been working on for 6 months to the VP of my department and received glowing reviews from him which is huge for my career. This is the 2nd glowing review I've received in the last month on something I've done, so I've been feeling really good about my job recently.
On my way home from work, I called BF to tell him about it and share my good news, and asked him how his day was. For about 10 minutes he complained about all the things that have been going wrong recently. I listened and sympathized and told him I was sorry that those things were happening. It wasn't anything bad or serious, just people being stupid and difficult for various reasons. When he was done, I shared my good news and he didn't acknowledge it, just started talking about something else that was going wrong.
I shut down and stopped listening to what he was saying because he completely deflated my pride. I felt ignored and unacknowledged so I spoke up and said that the news I just shared was a really big deal for my career and it felt shitty that he didn't acknowledge it. This caused an argument about how he was going to acknowledge it eventually but didn't in the moment but I shouldn't have said anything because he was in a bad mood.
Later that night, I sent him a picture that said ""Just a reminder of how cute I am even when you're mad at me"" trying to smooth things over. I was left on read.
The next day, I texted him when I got out of work ""I hope you had a good day today, I love you"" and he responded several hours later ""thank you"".
After about an hour, I called him (I was at the bar and drinking, probably not the best time to call someone) and asked if everything was ok because I said ""I love you"" and he didn't say it back. He insisted everything was fine and I ""think too much"" and then we got into this 30 minute discussion about how the person in the bad mood matters more than the person in good news, and it's hard to be happy for someone when you're in a bad mood. He also argued that he tells me he's proud of me all the time and the one time he didn't, I had to bring it up and ""sometimes the best thing to do is not say anything"".
My argument was that we both messed up and I could have been more empathetic with him but he also could have been more empathetic with me because this was a really big deal for me. This also pissed him off because of the above ""sometimes the best thing to do is not say anything"".

23,1fno02y,AITA for tattling on my neighbors?,"Background: My husband and I live in a garden style apartment building, surrounded by mostly young families and young couples. There are two buildings attached to each other, with 6 units in each, that share a small parking lot of 12 spaces. Parking is included in our rent (parking stickers has to be displayed or you get towed) but you can only have max 2 cars per unit. Given the area that we live has a lot of public transportation options, most people only have 1 car, so parking isn’t too big of an issue. But if there are no spots available, you have to park on the street outside the complex. 

The issue: We have never really had issues with finding parking in our lot and only occasionally having to park on the street. That is, until recently. About 6 months ago, our neighbors, who already have 2 cars, had a few people (I assume family?) move in with them. These ‘guests’ brought 2 more cars with them. Obviously since you can’t have more than two cars per the lease, they do not have parking stickers. But they still park in our lot and the only time I ever see them leave is when the tow truck comes (it comes at the same time every morning) they will temporarily move to avoid being towed, then come back. So basically, one unit now takes up 4 of the 12 spaces. I only really know our neighbors across the hall so I talked to them about it. They were also annoyed because they never get parking anymore due to the time they get home from work and the cars parked on the street are constantly getting broken into.

I tried reaching out and wrote them a letter a few weeks ago asking if their guests could please park on the street since they are only allowed two cars per unit - but that had gone ignored. So yesterday I emailed the leasing office to see if they could remedy the situation. 

My husband thinks I’m an asshole because these family members (again, I’m not actually sure they are family, but it seems to me like they are) probably had to move in due to financial hardship -  as who would want to move into a small 2 bedroom apartment with 5 people - and my going to the leasing office might get them kicked out since they are likely unauthorized occupants. I can empathize with that and did think about it, which is why I reached out to them first. But they ignored me.

24,1fnnnky,AITA for confronting my roommate about her unfair amount of things?,"I (23 F) live in an apartment with three of my friends (all 23 F). One of my roommates is a self-proclaimed “boho maximalist” and enjoys interior design, art, knick-knacks, etc. On one hand, it’s great because she has a lot of the things we needed for our new place. On the other, she has so much stuff that it’s becoming almost unbearable. She refuses to throw things away (always using the excuse that we may need it one day) and anything she’s not using goes into our shared storage spaces. This would be fine if we had an abundance of space, but we have one large closet to share between the four of us. The closet is almost full with all of her stuff (mainly clothes, seasonal decor, random throw pillows, etc.) and she still has more she has yet to unpack/put away. Additionally, her mother keeps sending her things that we do not have room for and my roommate will not either 1. send it back to her mom 2. donate it or throw it away.

The other issue at hand is that she refuses to hear anyone else out on ideas for decorating. I, myself, have some decor and art that I’d like to put up but every time I try to do so or pitch an idea to her, I’m immediately shot down if it doesn’t align with what she wants. When I try to decorate myself, I come home from work to find that they’ve been replaced or put away with the excuse “I just thought it looked better like that!” 

This all culminated in her returning from a two week trip abroad (where she left all of her things not in storage in our living room as we are waiting on the arrival of a couch that has yet to come) to complain about the fact that in order to make room for said couch my roommates and I put her SOME of things in her room and how it was annoying that we did that. I’m not a confrontational person, but I went off. 

I said that there was no reason for her to have as much stuff as she does and that it’s unfair of her to expect us to only make room for her things and to disregard any thing or idea that the rest of us have in order to fit whatever vision she has. I said that it felt like I was living with a hoarder and now neither me or my other two roommates have anywhere to put our things in storage or elsewhere in the apartments that are not our rooms. 

I feel bad confronting her in this way, as we’ve never fought before, but was so fed up with this situation. Looking at our shared living spaces is stressing me out so badly that it’s starting to affect me physically (I get stress hives and migraines and they’ve been present in some way since this began). I was told by my other non-confrontational roommates that I was a little harsh during this interaction and probably could have been gentler about it. Am I the asshole?

Shes nice for the most and I’ve never had a problem with how she treats my brother. 

I only have one rule for any kind of guests whether it be mine or my brothers, which is don’t let the cats outside. We have two currently.

27,1fnn9b1,AITA for refusing to refund my pregnant friend who cancelled last minute on our pre-booked holiday?,"For the past few months, we (24F, 25F, 26F, 27F, 28F) have been discussing and planning our girls trip to Greece. We were all onboard and confirmed logistics then began to book the flights and Airbnb. We all paid the Airbnb in full upfront and agreed to split the cost equally between us.

5 days before we fly out (mid September) our newly married friend (25F) sends a very long paragraph to our holiday group chat announcing that she is pregnant and therefore is unable to come because of some complications. She stated at the very end of her announcement message that we should pay her back after the holiday and not to worry about it now. She didn’t ask if we could consider or if we’re able to pay her back. She just made the statement and assumed it was her right.

In the paragraph she states she found out about her pregnancy over two months ago (early July) and was keeping it quiet. More so, on the 5th August we booked our flights and airbnb, and In the same conversation, someone mentioned thinking she’s pregnant because of health complaints that she’d been making and she replied with “you wish” and that “my partner wouldn’t let me travel if I was” which at this point, reservations were confirmed and we all had paid our portions but we now know that she knew she was pregnant all along. 

We made it clear when booking that we’re all on a set budget and we found the Airbnb specifically within our budgets given it would be divided by 5 people including her (everyone who confirmed attendance). Now that she’s expecting a refund, it takes the amount we each paid for the Airbnb way outside of our budgets and is unreasonable for any of us to pay that amount if we do redivide. There were a couple girls going through financial difficulty and they made it clear they’d only be involved in certain activities that fit their budget. Especially now that she’s cancelled last minute, making changes to the reservations are out of the question.

For context, this particular friend has a tendency of being flakey and uncommunicative, especially in the come up to events. Sometimes only when it suits her, will she communicate. In the run up to the holiday she was especially quiet, distant and not replying to messages. Almost as though she wanted to build anticipation to her pregnancy announcement. But now this issue has tainted her whole announcement and we feel blind sided by the fact she expects a refund. 

None of us are able to accept the new cost of the Airbnb nor her entitlement in expecting a refund. However she is our friend and going through what seems to be a tough 1st trimester (unbeknownst to us), we want to be empathetic and understanding to her situation but why wasn’t she empathetic to the financial situation of those her actions have now affected.

More so, on the 5th August we booked our flights and airbnb, and In the same conversation, someone mentioned thinking she’s pregnant because of health complaints that she’d been making and she replied with “you wish” and that “my partner wouldn’t let me travel if I was” which at this point, reservations were confirmed and we all had paid our portions but we now know that she knew she was pregnant all along. 

We made it clear when booking that we’re all on a set budget and we found the Airbnb specifically within our budgets given it would be divided by 5 people including her (everyone who confirmed attendance). Now that she’s expecting a refund, it takes the amount we each paid for the Airbnb way outside of our budgets and is unreasonable for any of us to pay that amount if we do redivide. There were a couple girls going through financial difficulty and they made it clear they’d only be involved in certain activities that fit their budget. Especially now that she’s cancelled last minute, making changes to the reservations are out of the question.

For context, this particular friend has a tendency of being flakey and uncommunicative, especially in the come up to events. Sometimes only when it suits her, will she communicate. In the run up to the holiday she was especially quiet, distant and not replying to messages. Almost as though she wanted to build anticipation to her pregnancy announcement. But now this issue has tainted her whole announcement and we feel blind sided by the fact she expects a refund. 

None of us are able to accept the new cost of the Airbnb nor her entitlement in expecting a refund. However she is our friend and going through what seems to be a tough 1st trimester (unbeknownst to us), we want to be empathetic and understanding to her situation but why wasn’t she empathetic to the financial situation of those her actions have now affected. It’s seems as though she agreed to the holiday and strung us along knowing she wouldn’t be coming. AITA?",0.0,0.05559197,0,1
28,1fnn4j4,AITA for refusing to let my in-laws stay with us after they trashed my house last time?,"So here’s the situation. A couple of years ago, my wife’s (F34) brother (John, M36) and his wife (Sarah, F35) were going through a rough patch and needed a place to stay for a few weeks while they figured things out. My wife, being the caring person she is, asked me (M37) if they could stay with us temporarily, and I agreed because family is family, right?  
  
Well, the ""few weeks"" turned into nearly four months. During that time, they completely took advantage of our hospitality. John treated our house like it was his own personal man cave, leaving trash everywhere and never helping with chores. Sarah wasn't much better—she kept ""borrowing"" things from our kitchen and bathroom without asking and never replaced anything. Our guest room looked like a tornado hit it when they finally left.  
  
The worst part? They had two kids (5 and 7 at the time), and while I get that kids can be a handful, they were out of control. They would run through the house at all hours, break things, and scream over every little disagreement. My wife and I repeatedly asked John and Sarah to rein their kids in, but it always fell on deaf ears.  
  
After they moved out, it took us weeks to clean up the mess they left behind, and we even had to replace some broken furniture. My wife apologized, and we agreed that we wouldn’t put ourselves through that again.  
  
Fast forward to now: John and Sarah are once again having issues and asked if they could stay with us ""for a little while"" while they figure things out (again). My wife immediately said yes, but I put my foot down and said absolutely not. I reminded her of the disaster that was their last stay and told her I wasn’t willing to go through that again, especially since they hadn’t apologized or acknowledged how badly they treated our home the last time.  
  
My wife is upset, saying I’m being heartless and that family comes first. She thinks I should give them another chance and says I'm overreacting. But I feel like I’m just setting boundaries. We have two kids of our own, and I don’t want them to have to deal with the chaos that John and Sarah always seem to bring.  
  
Now my wife is giving me the cold shoulder, and her family thinks I’m the bad guy for not helping out in ""a time of need.""

We all currently live together in my husband’s late grandfather’s home along with his step father, great grandmother, and grandmother. I’ve never really had issues or been disrespectful or anything less than helpful and kind to my mother in law. Although, whenever guest/other family members are around lately she’s always had something negative to say about me. She usually says it in the form of a joke in order to not make it seem so bad, but it’s still bad (random example, yesterday my husband’s uncle came to do laundry cause his laundry machine was broken and its my MIL day to do laundry and she unnecessarily said in front of everyone “i didn’t do laundry today cause you’re my baby brother and i’ll help you but if (me) needed to do it she’d say no because i live here”. 
Or another recent one was (backstory: my husband and I had issues in the start of our relationship that she knows about we’ve since worked past) some family was in town from out of the country that i haven’t met before but were very important in my husband’s younger days so he loves them a lot i was very eager to meet them. When we’re all downstairs greeting them before I even got a chance to introduce myself to them,his mother is having a conversation with them and for some reason mentions how i can be jealous/toxic. Before I even got to introduce myself to his cousins, she’s already giving them these preconceived thoughts about me. I never say anything though idk why maybe i’m too nice. i try to be respectful because it’s my husbands mom. But Am i the asshole for not wanting to be around her so much?

My brothers (32 and 39) made some not so good choices so they never ended up finishing the remainder of their education, I also feel it is important to mention that they love to ask my parents for money, materials etc. usually after they get what they need they cut off my parents until they need something else. 

I am very close with my parents, especially my mom. My dad wasn’t really around when raising me because of his active duty events he needed to travel to different countries for (Military), which is why I am super close to my mother.

Me and my boyfriend are doing long distance at the moment, but he surprised me by buying a planet ticket to come visit me! I asked my parents if they would pick him up for me because I would be in the middle of a performance at the time he flew in at, (I do theatre). I would have got him myself but my parents wouldn’t allow me to bring my car to school, and I am in the middle of a performance so I literally cannot grab him. So, I asked my mom and dad if one of them can pick him up since this they live next to the airport, they said they would and are happy to but I get a text about an hour later from my mother saying, “I know you don’t think this is rude behavior, but it feels at though you are only using us to get your boyfriend and we have fallen down the priority list.”

I felt awful and we had a long talk where I apologized for making them feel like I only used them for their resources.

Now, jumping to yesterday night. I do the marketing for my schools insta and I needed a camera to take some nice photos but it’s unfortunately am unable to buy my own camera. I then remember my dad has a nice camera that he never uses so I text in the family group chat asking if it would be alright to borrow it for a couple a days. They both said yes and they said they would bring it up at the end of the week. I got a text from my mother at 2 AM saying this: “Hey so the camera thing: why are you needing the camera?  Because it actually is not cool to ask dad for it.  Your school should have access to students who take photography classes or your production should have access to equipment. If this is something that you are going to ask for now every time then maybe not ask Dad for it. Because you know he would do anything for you and again this seems like another example of you taking advantage of us being close.”.

I don’t believe I was taking advantage of them, at all. I asked bc there is no other way to get a camera. All the “equipment” we have from the photography department is individually owned by the students, and I have told them that. 

Am I the asshole?

31,1fnllfd,AITA for apparently not following plane etiquette ,"Okay so I recently came home from a month long work trip I live in Georgia but have been in Oklahoma for the last month away from my friends and family. 

On the day of my plane ride home I got to the airport and decided I had no use for the carry on bag that I had dealt with on the trip to Oklahoma so I decided to check it along with my previously checked bag that way all I would have to deal with was my computer backpack and not have to drag a carry on around with me since I also had a lay over of about 2 hours, and I thought if I have no carry on then I hopefully can get off the plane quicker. 

I have an aisle seat on the plane and as soon as we start to land at my final destination in Georgia. I already have the arm rest up flipped so I can get up quicker. When the seat belt light goes off I get out of my seat quickly and go up the aisle as fast as I can since I was in the 2nd to the last row of the plane I walked past a lot of people. Each row on this plane was 6 seats with the aisle going down the middle. I got over halfway towards the front before I ran into the line of other people waiting to exit. 

As I moved up the aisle I rushed past a guy who was just starting to get up and I said excuse me and did not touch him or bump him at all but he got angry with me and told me I was being rude AF by doing what I did and not following etiquette. There was about 12 rows from where he was to where I ended up stopping to wait. So in my mind I skipped waiting on 36 people. 

I waited patiently as the few people I got stopped behind all waited and let row after row of people out and I watched as they all fiddled with their bags after getting them out of the overhead compartment and yeah it annoyed me to wait but I never said a word I was just happy I skipped waiting on over half the plane. 

I got to the baggage claim and got to see my wife and son whom I’d been away from for a month and why I wanted off the plane because I missed them. The guy from the plane ran into me at baggage claim and called me an asshole for rushing to the front on the plane. He then said I was an asshole when I said I just didn’t see a point and waiting if I had no carry on and that I just wanted to see my family. 

He told me that I was still a jerk and asshole because he saw me also not let some people who were still in their row out into the aisle like everyone else was and instead I just walk past them. 

So am I the asshole? 

Edit: No one got slammed or bulldozed it wasn’t like a Black Friday sale I just bypassed waiting on a bunch of people I didn’t want to wait on. The guy who called me out wasn’t even in the aisle.

It started with a visit for her to see our new home for the first time. She brought flowers, it was a planned visit. She had seen our baby once before. When she got here, baby was asleep so I showed her around. We ate something and then baby woke up. She never had children of her own and lives alone. She wanted to hold baby and kept trying to kiss her. I asked her multiple times please take your shoes off and she did at first but then forgot and kept walking through my house with them on. She kept saying “my baby” “where is my baby”. 

When she was leaving she noticed the yard needed work so she said she would come over the following week and work on the beds some for me. She recently moved into an apartment and said “I would love to do it because I don’t have a house of my own anymore.” This was unprompted but appreciated, as my husband works long hours and I am trying to take care of baby. Fast forward to the following week, she comes and starts to tell me what needs to be done, and complains that my husband isn’t doing anything. She complained that our neighbor had mowed our front lawn and asked me “why is your elderly neighbor mowing your front lawn?” He apparently did it in payback for my dad siding his house for free a few years ago. She told me that “she’s divorced her husbands over stuff like this” and said “this is unacceptable.”


She complained to my mother, who we rent the house from, who came to pick me up one day. I had told my friend that my mother was coming and she said “okay, tell me about 15 minutes before she gets here and I will clean up and go!” Well I did, and she didn’t leave. My mom pulled into the driveway and my friend started to tell her everything she thinks needs to be done at the house and everything that she thinks needs to be bought like grass seeds and grub control and weed control etc… she complained about my husband to my mom and my mom defended him because he usually works long days 7am-6pm or longer. My mom also said that my friend said to her “oh are you here to snatch kindlydesigner away from me?” Hearing that she said that creeped me out slightly. She also told me that she wanted to print out a picture of my baby for her house.

I had never asked her to come over and do yard work, I offered her compensation multiple times and she refused. Now she invites herself over “I am coming over” and rarely gives me a time. She always brings food and lots of things, which again, is appreciated but I feel indebted to her for all the food, work, and gifts. She says things like “I feel so at home” “I am so happy I get to see [my baby’s name] grow up” “I would be mad if you didn’t let me garden in your yard”

My friend kept demanding that I buy some stuff for her, deliver those gifts to her friends and when they go back home she would receive those gifts. It sounds easy but the thing is I am an introverted person, I don't like to travel a lot and talk with new people. Her friends, i don't know them heck we don't even speak the same language. 

Few days ago in the morning she shared her friend's location. The location she gave me was far from my home and unknown to me. I've never been there before plus I'm very bad at tracking locations. Even my mother yelled at me saying it's dangerous to go alone, don't go there, so I listened to my mother.

Here's something about my friend, if she is mad she would curse or swear badly and say stuff like did you die or did you break your hand and legs why didn't you pick my call? ya she would say that in our conversation. My sister says my friend always plays the victim card and she is a narcissist yet for long periods I have been in contact and supporting her because she was alone there and she had been suffering from depression, she also visited a psychiatrist from time to time. I knew she was using me to relieve her anger, whenever she had a bad day at work she would call me and yell at me for no reason. Even though she knows I'm an introvert she keeps interfering in my personal space and doesn't respect My space at all. She made me run her errands. If I didn't agree with her plan she would use aren't you my best friend method. I remember while she was abroad I had to travel long distances from my home just to buy clothes for her which she saw on a social media app. One time she asked me to buy cake and presents for our friend's birthday and deliver that stuff saying it was a birthday surprise from my friend. She knew i was unemployed yet she just said i will pay back and paid less from what i have spent. I knew if i said something she would brag i am living in foreign country and I earn lots of money.

That same night she called me, yelled at me saying her friends were waiting for me and I didn't show up there. She talked rudely towards me, I never ever talked badly towards her because cursing and saying bad things that's not my habit. Well I had enough, I simply cut off the call and started brushing my hair. I was thinking i didn't say i agree to go there and she also didn't ask if i bought the gifts or not. She again called me but I ignored her and she kept calling me. I just deleted that app and logged out from all the social media accounts. After that she even called my mom but my mother didn't pick it up. I thought if I kept following her order after a few years she might use me like a puppet. It's been almost 4 days since I haven't replied to her nor logged in my social media app.

Her friends from abroad are now going back to their own country. My friend kept demanding that I buy some stuff for her, deliver those gifts to her friends and when they go back home she would receive those gifts. It sounds easy but the thing is I am an introverted person, I don't like to travel a lot and talk with new people. Her friends, i don't know them heck we don't even speak the same language.

35,1fnkl3w,AITA for doing something dangerous and blaming it on my family?,"So basically I (17F) used to be really good friends with a girl that I met when I joined high school. She was always nice to me until she moved to a different country when we were in 10th grade, where she met new friends and a bf. She would always add me into group chats and be mean to me. My family kept asking me to block her but I never did. There was even one situation where my family sided with her on an argument we had becuase I was joining the group chats and everything and never blocked them. So apparently it was my fault.

Then she added me out of the blue a few months later, wanting to be friends again. I agreed to being friends with her again, because I’m a very forgiving person. We were going fine until one day she FaceTimed me and asked me if I wanted to do something cool that’s he found on TikTok. I agreed not knowing what to expect. She wanted me to grab a rag and a can of air re freshener and to huff it, I didint know what that was so I just did it with her. I got high off of it with her and we kept chatting afterwards. She warned me before doing it to be careful and that I could die from it. But I did it anyways, because I thought she was joking. Then after the FaceTime call, I realized that what she made me do was actually dangerous. And that it can cause brain damage, sure, I only did it once with her, but based on what I’ve read, once is enough to cause brain damage.

I told my parents about it and they said it was my fault because I could have just refused to do it and blocked her if she kept insisting. I wasn’t afraid of this happening at the time, but I realised that if I did refuse and blocked her she could have went messaging my sister making up lies about me when they’re not true. And of course my parents would believe her since I’ve lied so much in the past and have gotten into many situations and have even bullied people. So they have no reason not to believe her. So I now believe that I was forced to do it. And I have been kind of giving my parents attitude a lot because of this. I blame it on them, because even though I’m not certain that she would have contacted my family making up lies about me if I didn’t do it with her, I feel like it’s a possibility since she’s that kind of person. My parents think I’m just being paranoid, and that she wouldn’t have done anything like that if I refused to do it. 

It was no where near as simple as just blocking her the moment she pressured me into doing something dangerous and moving on, she could have spread lies about me to my family if I refused to do it, she has done that in the past. And since I’ve been such a irresponsible and immature person, even other students in the school have made up lies about me and the school believed them with no proof, that’s how problematic I was, the school staff didn’t even have to see proof that I did these kinds of things, they already knew I was guilty, that’s how bad of a student I was. 

So, of course they would believe her over me since they have lost faith in me since I’ve lied so much in the past, and they just don’t know what to believe anymore. I mean one time when my parents were at a school meeting with me because I had pushed a girl into a radiator and made her suffer in pain from back problems for a full week. My mom literally said: “if she told me that it was sunny outside, I would have look outside the window to check, that’s how much she lies.”

I contacted her about it saying that she ruined my health and that it’s her fault, and she replied saying  she wouldn’t even have been mad if I refused to do it, because she has other friend’s to do it with anyways. She also says that I had a choice, and that I chose to do it with her. But why should I believe her?

As I said, I’ve been looking after him for 20 months, I was there during treatment, doctor visits, 8 hospital stays and one in the hospice. Apart from that I had to work, look after our son, house etc. I totally neglected myself , I have severe depression, panic attacks , GERD and IBS. My son is in a constant worry and really is struggling. 
So here we are, my husband has been admitted today again to a hospice to give me some rest but also he’s deteriorating. He’s a tough cookie tho, I was told this could go on for another 2-3 months. I can’t carry on living like that ! I have nothing left in me. I’m 37 and my life’s give me zero joy (apart from my gorgeous son)

38,1fnix3q,AITA for asking my mom if I have to cancel my plans to support my stepsister at her play?,"Last week I (16M) asked my mom if I had to cancel my plans with my friends and go to my stepsister's play instead. I wanted to keep the plans with my friends and didn't want to go to the play. But my mom said I did have to go because I support my sisters when they have sports games, so the least I can do is show up to my stepsisters plays as well. My question ended up bothering her and her husband (of 6 months) more when my sisters also wanted to do other stuff instead.

Mom pulled me aside after the play and she told me I was very different at the play than at the games and how I'd never asked to miss something when it was supporting my sisters. She told me she didn't like that I wanted to miss something for my stepsister. That it encouraged my sisters to want to do other things too. She said we're all a family now and I should be just as encouraging and supportive to my stepsister as I am to my sisters. I didn't say much until she asked me why I had asked when I don't ask to skip my sisters things. I told her it's different because my sisters are my sisters and I love them and love showing up for them but I don't feel those things for my stepsister. I said it's not the same to me.

This pissed her off and she told me that my stepsister had heard me ask and that the more she thought about it the more she felt I was showing very blatant favoritism between *all three siblings* and that just because my sisters are bio related it doesn't make them more important than my stepsister.

We’ve been super close since high school, so it made total sense to move in together last year. I thought it would be awesome, like just two besties living their best lives, right? But lately, it’s been kinda… annoying?

So, I’m the type of person who likes things clean and organized. Like, I don’t think it’s that hard to keep up with your own mess, you know? But lately, she’s just been leaving dishes out, never takes the trash out, and I’m literally the only one who vacuums or does laundry. It’s like I’m living with a teenager or something. I have to remind her to pay her half of the rent and utilities too, and like… we’re grown adults here. Why am I acting like her mom?

I just said I feel like I’m doing everything and it would be nice if she could help out more.

But she got all defensive and acted like I was the bad guy? She was like, “I’ve been busy with school and stuff.” Um, she has way less classes than I do and doesn’t even work, so what’s that about? She literally called me “controlling” and “nitpicky.” Like, what?! All I’m asking is for her to do the bare minimum. It’s not that deep.

I feel like I shouldn’t have to pick up after her all the time just because she’s “busy.” We’re both adults, and if something’s going on, she should just say so, right?

He can't throw away anything that he deem necessary or important. It's too the point where my home is a dump. To give you examples of things he keeps, let me list them.

We have:
• Wires (either cut off, not working, sometimes good or just really old)
• PC (most of them broken or without much to save inside for the informatic parts)

• Cd to learn languages (yes it's okay to have them but I search just to count and I found out we had 20 with the majority being English and I didn't even tried hard enough)

And it's only the small part of the iceberg, because there's more. But back on the subject. So my dad keeps everything and when we talk (nicely) to him about how it's annoying to not even be able to invite someone over or just have a clean place to live, he gets grumpy and pout. It's like that for a bit more then 30 years and even if my mom try to make him stop he still does it, so I try my way. For a while now, everytime my dad complains about something or get grumpy, I make a ""playful"" remarks or comment that evolve cleaning up the mess he set up in my room, my parents's room, my brothers's room and the whole place basically, even if it wasn't the subject of the conversation he was complaining about. And to be honest I know when I do it, it came out quite bitchy and sarcastic, but I have enough with being in a home where it's basically a storage room. My mom and I (and even my brothers) tried the nice way, it didn't worked so now I think being rude with him could work. Not so long ago I had an argument with my 1rst brother because he said complaining and being mean to my dad like that made me look like a spoiled brat which pissed me off but the thing is I hate seeing everyone having a good and clean home while I get a dump, but also because my dad has the guts to judge others when he's no better in that department. I'm not asking for Beyonce's house, all I want is just a cleaned room (or just basically a clean home) without baggages, bags or boxes everywhere.

Just so you know, I'm not trying to talk shit about my dad or say 'i hate my dad' or something. I'm not that type of person nor do I like people disrespecting my dad (or any members of my family), all I want to know is if it's wrong, and if so if you have some advice to how I should behave for my problem (if there is), Thank you.

So is it wrong for me to act bitchy with my dad for (what I think is) a good reason ?",No A-holes here,2024-09-23,"AITA for acting bitchy with my dad ? To be clear, my dad is not abusive nor toxic, he's a great dad that think about his family and do everything he can to make us (my brothers and I) succeed and have a lot (like food, gift ect), but the thing is, he has a thing that piss me and my mom off (and I think my 2nd brother too). He can't throw away anything that he deem necessary or important. It's too the point where my home is a dump. To give you examples of things he keeps, let me list them.

We have:
• Wires (either cut off, not working, sometimes good or just really old)
• PC (most of them broken or without much to save inside for the informatic parts)

43,1fnhzx1,AITA for no longer talking or doing roommate things with best friend.,"I small back story... I started my years of uni in another country far away from my friends and family so the friends I made here are basically family to me. One of them is my best friend and current roommate Britney (19)(fake name)… this year we decided to live together in an apartment and because I love cooking and I'm good at it I do almost all the cooking for the two of us… where the problem comes in is I stopped talking and cooking and basically all roommate bonding stuff because of what she did. 

It all started when on a hike with a group of friends (including Britney) I was flirting and talking with this guy Tom (18) (fake name) … we totally were flirting and I had a crush on him … nothing serious but he would call me, text me, send voice messages and Britney being my best friend I told/showed all this and more to her she was hyping me up and totally feeding into my crush telling me to go for it. .. yesterday we decided to go to a club and Tom called me asked to come over early while we were getting ready and we all said yes… while we were there he made a comment basically rejecting me ( he said I think (other friends) has a crush on me but I had to turn her down because I don’t do relationships) but refused to look at me and I texted (said other friend) and she told me that never happened so basically it was him telling me he wasn’t interested without actually telling me….. I end up crying in the arms of my roommates (including Britney) and had a whole breakdown about me hating my outfit and how I looked … after lots of reassurance we started drinking then when to a pregame…. After the pregame we went to the club and the whole time Tom was alllllll over Britney and I just thought at this point maybe he was just a flirty guy.  Anyway we got to the club, and for the first time ever we got ID’d so they all went in first and it took me about 15 minutes to find a photo of my ID and talk my way in… by the time I got in half the group was in the bathroom but Britney and Tom came last saying that Tom was sick and puked and Britney didn’t feel good because  of the alc.. we dance and party we start making out with each other and guys then Britney starts making out with Tom and they are really into it... Basically eating each other in the club… she stops and asked me “omgggg is this ok I’m so sorry i’ll stoop if you want or uncomfortable I love you moreeee” (said in drunk voice). I drunkly told it was ok because it was just kissing and like they already kissed so like what can I do about it at this point sooo they continue to make out the whole time and it wasn’t till I got a text from my best friend back in the states that her boyfriend broke up with her that I said I was ready to leave (rough night for me)… My heart hurts and I’m jealous but whats done was done and its just kissing and I did tell her it was ok and he clearly doesn’t want me so we get home Britney is like dying drunk he is helping her and he ends up spending the night… he was supposed to be on the couch but turns out Britney asked him to stay in her bed…. Anyway, at like 6 am this morning they start going at it in our apartment… I wake up and go to the bathroom thinking I’m going to be sick, and I hear them. I go back to bed but wake up right as he leaves and then she has the audacity to explain the whole night and confesses that she didn’t feel sick and Tom didn’t throw up… they fucked in the bathroom in the club…Before the asked me … which I guess she doesn’t HAVE to ask me but it was super shady and not very girls girl-y. But then has the audacity to rub it in the next morning and I just sat there and listened to it because what am I supposedto say.

44,1fnhw1z,WIBTA for uninviting my dad from our house until he stops calling it an apartment?,"My husband and I (both in our 30s) bought our first house last year. It's an end-terrace in a major city, meaning it's small compared to countryside houses and shares a wall to another house. It's a house in our contract, in the bank valuation, by common sense, by all definitions.

My family is from the countryside. As soon as my dad saw the plans of the house, he started referring to it as an apartment and thought it was super funny. I thought it was weird, but knowing him, I just chuckled and moved on with conversation. Then it became a thing. He only ever referred to it as an apartment. I didn't laugh at it anymore, just said ""Come on dad, it's a house"", but I didn't make it a big deal and moved on.

One day, we had a phone conversation and he again called it an apartment mid conversation. I said ""Dad. It's not an apartment. It's a house."" and let some silence hang in the air. It got awkward and he laughed it off, saying ""Of course I know that, I don't mean anything by it..."" ""Then please call it a house. You're being impolite."" ""Okay, okay...""

Now, he makes it a joke to overcorrect himself. He talks about our ""apart- OH NO I'm the HOUSE hahaha"" while making faces. Not great, but I'm just exhausted at this point. Please note HE HAS NEVER VISITED THE HOUSE because he lives so far away. We usually visit him. He's only seen it on images.

So last weekend, he stayed over for his first visit. It was a nice weekend, apart from me ignoring his jokes and some other quirks of his. But overall, pleasant.

Then yesterday, it was my grandma's birthday (his mum). My whole family was there (50 people) apart from me due to the distance. I called my grandma in the evening and she asked me ""Did you move? I thought you bought a house last year."" ""No, still living in our same house. Why?"" ""Your dad's told everyone that you live in an apartment now"".

I then talked to grandpa who for the first time started referring to our house as an apartment. I later had my mum and uncle on the phone who always referred to it as a house, but now call it an apartment. And my mum told me dad even goes so far to call it a chicken den to her and my sisters because he finds it so ridiculous. Apparently, it's still the funniest joke to him, but the rest of the family takes it as fact.

I'm fed up. I want to tell him that he's not invited anymore until he starts being respectful, but whenever I have an opinion, I'm being ""hysterical"" and in the wrong. My husband is Teflon - he thinks my dad is not very bright about social cues and I should not argue with an idiot, but I'm not as unfazed as he is by this kind of stuff.

So WIBTA if I tell him to leave me alone and not stay over again until he changes his attitude?

EDIT: I live in the UK, it is called a house here.

EDIT 2: He actually calls in a flat, I just incorrectly Americanised for some reason since we're on Reddit. Apologies.

EDIT 3: Thanks for the input everyone! I have written a long message, in which I expressed my frustration to my dad about him repeatedly calling our house a ""flat,"" even though I had asked him not to. I explained that while the word itself didn’t matter, it hurt that he ignored my feelings. I said it became more upsetting when he said it in front of other family members, and they started using the same term. I asked him to stop making this joke and to respect our home the way I see it.

He has a habit of talking over me on the phone and not properly listening to me, so I figured a message would be more effective. This was his response:

> ""Hey big girl (*I'm tall*)… so, actually, yesterday we were mostly talking about what a nice weekend it was... The topic of the flat or whatever it is was really just a side issue... By the way, I didn’t even talk about it during the whole weekend with you guys... why would I? ... it’s not that important to me at all... which is why I don’t need to pay much attention to it… and besides, the whole thing lasted at most 5 minutes... so everything’s chill... I’m a little surprised that this even made its way to you at all… Best, Dad.""

I responded:

> ""If it’s not that important, then I don’t understand even more why you insist on calling it a flat? Especially when I’ve asked you not to do so. As I said, I would really appreciate it if we could drop the joke.""

He didn't respond after that. I later got a hunch and called my mum (his ex-wife). She was upset, but not with me. Apparently, he forwarded my messages to each of them and left very angry voice messages about my ""hysteria"", accusing them of ""ratting him out"" and ""disloyalty"" - they didn't say anything, it was my grandparents.

My mum lost it and gave him a huge telling off for speaking to all of us that way and that he should know better than to behave like this at their age (both 55). That he should be a more supportive dad and not such a ""bull in a china shop"". He hasn't been in touch with anyone since, I imagine he's sulking. He's never been great with criticism.

Anyway, I feel supported by my mum and guilty because I caused a family argument. I hope he mulls everything over and comes to the conclusion that he won't do it again.

My son is now 27 and my daughter is now 25. Colin and I broke up while I was pregnant with our daughter. But he remained a part of their lives until his passing just 6 months after our daughter was born. We hadn't worked out as partners. But we got along okay. Just very different people who couldn't make a relationship work and had kids very early in our relationship. Colin's family were in my children's lives from the start and remained a part of their lives long after he was gone. We never got along but they adored my children and my children adored them in return. Their favorite thing was the week they spent with his family each summer.

When my daughter was 7 and my son was 9 I met my husband. We married after 2.5 years of dating and we had already lived together for a year. My husband has no children of his own. We had none together. He was a very loving stepdad to my kids. My kids and him have a nice relationship but neither of them call him dad and neither wanted to be adopted by him... which did come up a year into our marriage. He asked. I wanted to find out what the children wanted and spoke to them. They said no. This was not something they later asked for or wanted.

My daughter is getting married next year and she asked me if I would walk her down the aisle. I immediately said yes and was so moved by the fact she felt I was the best, and only, person for the job. She even told me how much it meant to her that I never erased her dad when we weren't even together when he passed. She said I always put them first and I had been the best mom. I cried so hard. She asked her brother to dance with her in honor of their dad.

My husband was upset he wasn't asked to walk her alongside me. And he was hurt that I accepted without suggesting we should both do it. I explained that my daughter had her reasons to ask me. Then he mentioned the dance in honor of her dad and how she wasn't even doing that with him. I told him I was sorry he was feeling so hurt. He told me he felt like all the little things she asked him to do were just as a way to keep the peace instead of her truly wanting him to have a role in her wedding. I'm still not sure what these things were, and I did ask, but he wasn't happy about them. He told me I should take a stand and insist he be included or I don't walk her down the aisle. I told him I wasn't willing to let my daughter down or myself. I told him it was very special to me and my daughter. He told me I'm not honoring our vows if I do this.

46,1fnhpog,AITAH for not telling a friend I was in town for the night? ,"
I have a couple of really close friends who live a few hours away from me. I see them on a regular basis and we plan vacations, weekends get togethers, and all sorts of things together. I am always traveling for work so driving three hours isn’t a big deal. 

Here’s why I might be the asshole. I was in their town for a night and didn’t let them know. I had dinner plans with a guy I was talking to online. I didn’t get into town until 4pm and had early dinner plans with the date around 530pm and was in bed by 10pm. I booked a hotel and I was heading out of town the next morning to visit friends for other plans in another city. Less than 16 hours in the city. 

My one friend saw I was in town by my location share on my phone and said she was shocked I didn’t say I was in town. She was making quite a big deal about me not mentioning it. I didn’t mention it because I didn’t have time to see anyone besides the date. I wouldn’t be upset if they were in my town and didn’t have time to say hi as I know we are all busy with our own lives. We also have a vacation planned for next month so it’s not like we won’t be spending time with each other soon. 

So am I the asshole?

I didn’t mention it because I didn’t have time to see anyone besides the date. I wouldn’t be upset if they were in my town and didn’t have time to say hi as I know we are all busy with our own lives. We also have a vacation planned for next month so it’s not like we won’t be spending time with each other soon. 

So am I the asshole?

47,1fnhlrf,WIBTA if I continued to let my step-daughter sneak things into the house?,"So, I (38F) am married to my husband (42M). I have 2 kids and he has one with his ex, Alice (11F). My husband has 50/50 custody so Alice is around a good chunk of the time.

Few weeks ago, Alice started ""sneaking"" some of her sanrio (she's obsessed with the brand) plushies into the room she shares with my daughter. It was fairly obvious but I didn't comment on it nor did my husband.

I really thought nothing of it but my husband got a call from his ex. Apparently, she's been wanting Alice to get rid of the toys because she's getting too old for them and wants to give them to younger family members.

I think it's a bit cruel. My kids are older than Alice and I don't force them to give away their plushies unless it's obvious they don't care about them anymore (which Alice clearly does as she's attached). My husband doesn't really agree either as he bought most of her collection and feels like he should have a say in what's going with them and he doesn't want to give them away if Alice still likes them.

Is it wrong if I just don't comment on anything? My husband has made it clear to me he's not going to say anything as they're technically his toys and they should be here anyways. I really don't find harm in letting Alice take them over here either. But then again, as much as I love her as my own, I'm not legally her parent and don't know if I should really get a say in this.

48,1fnh8fm,"AITA for attempting to leave my sister at the airport when we were traveling together without telling her I was leaving, knowing she would freak out","My sister (20F) and I (23F) traveled to a wedding together. We attended nearby colleges and would hang out but we haven’t been close since high school. I can objectively say that my sister doesn’t like me because she admitted it. When she was still in high school she said “I changed” and hated how excited my mom be when I came home and took it out on me. We worked it out but I think she still doesn’t like me.

It was a stressful trip & we were both tired but she has a vitriolic way of speaking to me that she doesn’t to anyone else. We hashed out a fight before we got on the plane home but got into another after I asked to do laundry at her dorm and she declined. This pmo because I would often do her laundry for her at my college house as a favor because she didn’t want to do it herself. My sister doesn't know how/won’t do things sometimes because my parents or I will do them for her, an example being traveling long distances alone. I hate giving in but often do to keep the peace.

We got into another fight about getting back from the airport; I wanted to take the train because it’s cheaper and she wanted to Uber because it was late and she was tired. I remarked that if I was alone I would just take the train and she lost it. She hates when I give her advice and thinks that I’m being condescending. We used to joke around a lot but now she takes everything I say as an offense. We deplaned and I beelined for the bathroom, deciding to take the train & she can just Uber alone. I know this is mean spirited but she’s an adult and I didn’t want to be around her anymore so I just left while she was still in the bathroom. She repeatedly called me and I didn’t answer until I reached the train shuttle, saying I’m just doing what she told me to do during our argument and taking the train alone. She starts panicking and says that she’ll come with me on the train so I finally relent and tell her how to get to me. I still don’t want anything to do with her but she yells at me on the shuttle and sits next to me on the train and starts crying. She finally says that she “was going to apologize when we got out of the bathroom but now she’ll never forgive me.”

It’s a quick Uber ride from the train but hers doesn’t come so I let her in mine and add a stop to get her home. I was supposed to sleep at her dorm but stayed with a friend instead to avoid her until my train home tomorrow since I flew with her instead of an airport closer to home. I’m not speaking to her still; our dad was awake and I told him I’m not talking to her until my parents make her go to therapy. I’m going to hold firm because I’ve had enough and she’s just going to keep resenting me and treating me like shit unless something changes. Maybe this will be enough to shake things up so she can work through her feelings towards me alone but either way, I don’t want anything to do with her while she hates me so much.

50,1fnh5te,AITA for not buying my autistic cousin a toothbrush?,"This is my first Reddit post so please bear with me. 

 Me (F22) and my bf went to my aunts house last week (not unusual we don’t live far) 

My aunt and uncle have 5 kids, 2 of which are twins Arthur and James 14. 

In the bathroom, I accidentally knocked Arthur’s toothbrush of the side. It fell behind the cupboard under the sink. I said I’ll buy him a new one because it touched the floor and especially since it fell somewhere that wasn’t too clean. 

My bf drove me, Arthur, James and their sister Lola 12 to the shop. We headed straight to the toothbrushes where I let them choose a new toothbrush. Arthur and Lola chose theirs fairly quickly but James didn’t. 

A little backstory on James. About 2 years ago he was diagnosed with autism, since then he’d say things like ‘It’s not my fault I’m autistic’ to get his own way. I know how hard it can be having autism as me, bf and brother has it, I know everyone is different and can affect people in different ways but James plays on this. 

He started looking at the electric toothbrushes. 
He picked up one for £80 and asked if he could have it. I explained that it was way out my budget and he should pick one like his siblings has. He then started complaining. 
I looked at the cheapest one which was £25 and said I could buy it as an early birthday present if he really wants it (his birthday is in November)
So as he wanted an electric one I said I’d get the one for £25 but he said he wants the £80 one. I was definitely not going to spend £80. I said if he’s got the money I’m willing to put £20 towards it for his birthday. He said he doesn’t. I said then he has to pick a cheaper toothbrush. 
James phoned his dad. He also said there’s no way he’s getting £60 for a toothbrush. James started to cry how his life is unfair and if he wasn’t autistic he’d be allowed to have the toothbrush. I said it doesn’t work that way and he can see that because the others didn’t get an electric toothbrush. 

When we got back home, James said things to his family that weren’t very nice. He got sent to his room but on the way up he looked at me and said ‘I f*cking hate you , go die’ This made me sad. 

A few days later James text me to say he was sorry and can I buy him the £25 toothbrush for his birthday.  I told him honestly that I want to forgive him but he made me upset. He said he just had an autistic meltdown and didn’t mean it. This is where I may be the AH. I told him just cause he’s autistic it doesn’t mean he can always blame his behaviour on this and he has to learn to control himself better and I will not be buying the toothbrush. 
His dad told me I need to buy it for him as I can’t go back on a promise. 
I never promised him anything. 
My aunt has said she understands if I don’t buy it but says I should get it to make James happy. 
I said I’m not buying it and he can have something else for his birthday closer to the date. 
He got upset and blocked me. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITA for not buying my autistic cousin a toothbrush? This is my first Reddit post so please bear with me.

51,1fngdpr,AITA for overreacting about a joke,"
Hello, for context I haven’t been the most confident person, even though people would tell me I’m over reacting I’ve never seen it and it’s always been an inner issue that I can’t explain in words. This has meant I’ve taken a gap year for my mental health, where I got braces done and also a surgery  recently to fix my ptosis issue, however due to the swelling it’s made my eyes smaller which panicked me and made me feel really self conscious. 

My boyfriend has advised me not do it as it was both our money but, I however advices him that I really needed this due to my eyes being really hindered because the excess skin affects my vision, he therefore agreed that the operation should be done and that it will help with university. 

After my surgery I had a lot of regret because I looked really different from what I expected but when it started going doing in swelling I was more comfortable and accepted that it will be a long process and I accepted it, but then my bf brother changed my whole perspective. 

I was joking about with them in the kitchen and then my bf brother and gf started taking the piss out of my recent surgery and telling me to put my glasses back on because I looked better and started naming Asian people, and saying that I came back from Korea like those people even though I’m not Asian. And it has made me feel like crap and I don’t feel like attending university until my surgery has healed. 

I know this is drastic but I have anxiety and it can be really crippling so the joke was 100x more hurtful then it would be to other people. Especially since I don’t know who the girl is that much it hurts even more, as I feel like uni people would have the same view.

Apart from my gf and my mum, there is no one I talk to on a regular basis and I haven't even seen a friend since January.

Most of my friends are from university and live in different parts of the country and we have different schedules so we never get to meet up. I had one good friend who lived in the same city, he was my best friend since we were around 10 years old and this year he just stopped talking to me for no reason and won't reply when I've asked what's happened.

I asked if she could be more considerate to how I'm feeling as I'm really low with the lack of a social life and hearing her complain about having so many people want to see her feels a bit like she's rubbing it in even if it's not intentional.

She said okay and left it at that. A few days later she again came up to me and started complaining about needing to find the time to meet with four different groups of friends and going on about how she'll be booked up for weeks.

I had a talk with her about that, I told her that I appreciate her support, but I would not like her to be in the delivery room with us because that is a intimate family moment, also I dont want her to come every day to see me since I will be exhausted probably and probably dont want too much company, but of course she is welcome to see the baby and welcome to visit after I recovered. I also told her I would not prefer her to move next to our place. I explained her that we will be best friends forever and support eachother, but we are grown ups. We have our own obligations and also our own lifes outside of the friendship and those cant be mix together. I could see she feels sad, but sadly thats how I see life. She then asked me if I would put my own family (kids and husband) before her and I said they are my priority but of course she is also very important to me and that didnt sit well with her. She basically got up dissapointed and said that I am putting someone who I have known less before her and that she is dissapointed that I dont want her to be a part of the most important time of my life.

I had a talk with her about that, I told her that I appreciate her support, but I would not like her to be in the delivery room with us because that is a intimate family moment, also I dont want her to come every day to see me since I will be exhausted probably and probably dont want too much company, but of course she is welcome to see the baby and welcome to visit after I recovered. I also told her I would not prefer her to move next to our place. I explained her that we will be best friends forever and support eachother, but we are grown ups. We have our own obligations and also our own lifes outside of the friendship and those cant be mix together. I could see she feels sad, but sadly thats how I see life. She then asked me if I would put my own family (kids and husband) before her and I said they are my priority but of course she is also very important to me and that didnt sit well with her. She basically got up dissapointed and said that I am putting someone who I have known less before her and that she is dissapointed that I dont want her to be a part of the most important time of my life. 

We didnt talk since. I am not sure if I came off to harsh, but I truly think this is not normal from her side.

My mom always seems to favour my sister and it's clear that my sister is the favourite child for her for example if someone is broken she will call me to ask me if I broke it and if I say no she would say then who else broke it and she always spent a lot on my sisters birthdays than she did for me like on my 10th birthday she just got me a cake and we invited some friends that's it but on my sister's 10th birthday she got my anty to dj got a camera man we went shopping for decorations and she even got my sis a princess dress or whatever she made sure that it was the best birthday yet because from her words everyones 10th birthday is supposed to be a grand celebration if that's the case then why was mine celebrated like that anyway another thing she does is if my sister accomplished something the look of happiness was genuine on her face but if I accomplished something it looks as if she has been forced to smile and act happy 
But my dad isn't any better my dad is normal not home a lot he leaves for work early and comes home very late but he's not really around to do much but when he is around the look on his face when he sees me looks like someone who is thinking oh right I have another daughter the usually has something mean to say to me like oh look you've put on weight(I'm not fat I'm just taller and more mature than kids my age like with more feminine features or whatever?)or why didn't you come and great me yesterday or you haven't done any work today and stuff like that but he never talked about anything my sister does she's just a normal teen in his eyes 
And them there's my first aunty she is always criticising every thing I to from how I brush my teeth to how and when I waer specific kinds of underwear every thing I do in her eyes is a problem but my sister is not really a problem though she somethings haves problem with my sister my sister just apologies like some kind of puppy answer me this do you really have to apologise for taking the last bread or some minor thing like that 
Then my second aunty it's obvious that she likes my sister more giving her some of her food and saying something like wow Emma (my sister) your smarter than lisa(me) you got 72 in math oh and it seem Lisa just got 69 I'm not good with school actually I'm very good I just stopped trying cuz my parents did seem to care

4 of my dad’s siblings have been really important to me some way or another in my life- by supporting my career, stepping in when I needed emotional support or sacrificing for our family. 1 has not- my aunt M (late60sF). M has not ever made any effort for me personally, either to get to know me or to behave as an aunt like my other aunts and uncles have. M also made no effort to care for our grandparents/her parents who have poor health and are deteriorating, despite the fact that until recently she lived down the road, has no young children or grandchildren and is not in employment. This has put a strain on other people who have had to step in where she has refused (including my dad, who has a demanding job and a teenage daughter). She’s also broadly kind of terrible- she makes catty comments to other people in the family and even puts down her own children, and has criticised other people for the decisions made about care for our grandparents (where she herself makes less than the bare minimum effort to help out). I don’t want that energy at my wedding and I also don’t want to invite someone who I don’t really have a relationship with beyond biological. An aside- she also didn’t invite me (or any of the cousins apart from her children) to her second wedding a few years ago. 

Why I might be the asshole- nobody in the family has done this before. They have either invited everybody or invited only the aunts/uncles- I’ve picked and chosen based on my relationship with people. It is singling M out because all of my other aunts and uncles on my dad’s side will be invited apart from her- her kids will be invited as well. I know M will not be happy and will blame my dad for this, she might even cut him off for a period of time because of me. I know that would really hurt my dad and while it would be her fault I would be responsible in part for that hurt. An aside but M’s child (my cousin) also died this year which made me feel like I should invite her although my relationship with her has not changed.

57,1fnf2ax,WIBTA for not attending my aunt's baby shower?,"For context: My Aunt (A) is having a baby boy. She already had her gender reveal, but she is having a baby shower. This baby shower is being hosted by another Aunt, who I will call T at her house.

T and I have a complicated relationship. I don't hate her, but I don't like her either. For various reasons, as when I was younger I was forced to spend the night at her house - even when I voiced my discomfort. I was scared of the dark and terrible separation anxiety.  It didn't help that my cousin showed a really scary video when I was.

She also had trash talked my parents in front of me - and when I voiced that I didn't like it. She would stop for a bit, and then continue to do so.

She had forced me into a tight outfit, when I had bought my clothes - which were comfortable and casual to go to an amusement park. The bra was tight, and so was shirt. I tried to tell her that I was uncomfortable and she ignored me.

Last year, during January - my uncle, (D) invited me out to dinner with my younger cousin. I agreed to go, and he told me that T will not be joining us. Come to find out later - that she did come with my cousin. And D told me that she was always going to come. I was lied to.

The dinner ended in an argument between T and D - and it wasn't a good night. On the way home D had yelled at me because of a miscommunication when ordering food, and brought me to tears.

The conflict. Well - my grandma called me, and then my cousins had her phone. Asking me why I wasn't attending the baby shower. I told them that ""I would be busy with school."" Which wasn't a lie. They told me that I should come - and that my aunt was sad that I didn't attend her gender reveal.

My grandma then told me to think real hard about it. 

I feel a bit guilty as A has done a lot for me. However, T has done a lot to hurt me emotionally. If I do say why I don't want to attend it could lead to drama and people having their feelings hurts. However, I don't want to be around someone like T.

58,1fnero2,AITA for asking my dad if I can get snake bite piercings? ,"I (16F) have been considering the idea of getting snake bites for over 2 years now. However, I had not brought it up to my parents before as I was not sure if I even wanted the piercing.

That being said, I recently came across a DIY trick on TikTok to create a fake snake bites piercing out of a paperclip. The only downside is that it's hard to keep in place and talk properly as it is just a deformed paperclip. I showed my boyfriend what I look like with it and he was neutral to the idea so I decided the next step would be to talk to my father (34M) about it.

What made me nervous to bring it up to him is that he hates any kind of piercing that isn't the traditional single ear piercing on women. Despite this, with the help of my mom I was able to convince my dad to allow me to get a septum piercing at the age of 14. The difference is, this time I don't live with my mom at all since her trailer is too small to fit me in it so I've been living with my dad full time.

When I went downstairs, showed him the fake piercing, and asked if I could get a real one, he immediately shut it down. He said that it looks terrible, that only bitches have snake bites and that I don't want to look like one, and randomly info dropped that one of the guys my mom cheated on him with in the past had snake bites and that if I got them it would constantly remind him of that guy. His exact words after dropping that information were, ""Don't do that to me."".

Now, my parents have been divorced for 2 years now and the guy he's mentioning specifically is from one of the incidents my mom cheated on my dad back in the early 2010s (2013 to be exact). It feels weird that he's projecting that onto me and it definitely made me upset. One of my brothers (14M) however, seems to be on my dad's side and said that snake bites on me do look terrible. The only person who had defended me irl throughout the whole situation was actually one of my dad's friends.

I really hadn't known about any of that information and I really wish that my dad hadn't said all those things to be honest. However, I am worried though that maybe I'm overreacting and possibly hurt my dad by accidentally reminding him of a bad past experience.

But I left the plastic packaging and some of the frozen sauce that seeped out of the packaging on the counter. I was planning on cleaning it up once I was done eating. I go to my room and set a timer to relax some more. 3 mins later my roommate enters the kitchen for some water, then says “WTF is this?” And throws away the packaging in the trash. Comes outside my room, agitated saying “clean up the mess, I mean it.” I tell him also in an agitated tone “Relax, I’ll clean it up once the fish is done cooking.” He responds with “I mean it.”

I’ll admit I should expect this, and cleaned up the mess immediately. I have procrastinating tendencies and I just want to chill when I’m done with work. Roommate also likely had a stressful day at work and this situation didn’t help that when he was ready for bed.

When he continued trying to insinuate I'm a bad frien, I revealed to him that when I met his other ""friends"", once he walked away from us, they all told me they don't like him but he forces himself on them like he's now doing to me. He got really upset after that but I was being honest for once after bottling up my feelings about him even when he made fun of me, called me fat and ugly etc

She moved in after my grandfather passed since my mom (49F) is her only child. Over time, I've grown more frustrated with her, as she often makes negative comments about everyone and everything and just her negative behaviour.

Recently, we had a relaxed dinner with instant noodles, and my mom brought out ice cream for dessert. I jokingly said, ""How am I not supposed to get fat eating like this?"" and laughed. After dinner, there were leftover noodles, so I volunteered to finish them. While I was eating, my grandmother, sitting beside me, said, ""How can you not be fat eating like this?""

For context, I'm 65kg and 1.63m tall, so I'd consider myself average. I also play sports and had just come back from a jog before the dinner. Her comment irked me, especially since she often criticizes and isn't in great shape herself. So, I snapped back, ""At least I exercise, unlike you. In fact, I just went jogging and what about you?""

A week ago, my brother and I had a disagreement with her about traveling overseas. She had gotten sick on two previous trips, even becoming disoriented, so we suggested she avoid traveling. She got furious and said she’d ""bear the pain"" if it meant she could travel. But when it comes to exercising, she always claims she ""can’t handle the pain"" of even simple house chores. So, I also threw that back at her, saying, ""Oh, so you can bear the pain for traveling but not for exercising?""

There’s more to how difficult my grandmother can be, but I do understand she’s still my mother’s mother. So, AITA?

63,1fnde3z,AITA for hating my dorm mate/friend after an argument and joke?,"To start this off, I’m sharing a dorm room with one of my friends from high school. We’ll call him Mike. Mike is a Hispanic guy, somewhat important to the story. He has a friend and we’ll call him Ben, who is African American, very important. Then there is my friend who we’ll call Tim, a white ginger, important as well.

Now, it’s been a few weeks and have been doing my regular stuff at home. Now, I see myself as a rather chill guy who takes a lot to make angry. Now, this kind of pissed me off, but I’ll try my best to speak in a non bias way.

Now, this started yesterday, around 7 to 8. I was playing a video game and Mike walks in with an angry mood. I choose not to mess with it due to wasn’t my business and I don’t like talking to angry people. I believe that they should just spend their own time to cool down. 

I just focused on my game, not wanting to get involved on whatever he was angry about. Now in my opinion, he is rather annoyed by small things or very sensitive whenever something happens to him. After a few minutes of angry pacing (bless the people underneath us) he sat down. It is then, he turned to me and said something which was making me fully surprised. “I wish all black people were to die in the holocaust.”

Now, I didn’t know what to say, if anyone can, how do you respond to this? Thankfully, I didn’t have to because he went on to explain to me that Ben spoiled some JJK leaks. Now, more things with context, I don’t read manga so I don’t really understand or know anything about this, but he was angry. Now, I once asked him why he is friends with Ben because I’ve never seen him and Ben get along well. I’ve spent time with Ben and I don’t like his unnecessary arguments and lies every other sentence.

His response to it was that he didn’t know, mainly to the fact that he just is. I don’t know if this is just me, but I have reasons that people are my friends otherwise, why would they be my friends. But back to the story, I’m still stun of that… joke.

Now, I’m a white guy who loves dark humor that is kind of fucked up because I suck. Now, that doesn’t mean I’ll laugh if someone says anything racist or just offensive to be offensive. I feel like a way to make one of these jokes work (in my opinion) is to be creative, the context, and how the tone comes out. 

To me, it’s not creative. He put black people dying and the holocaust into the same scenario, but it isn’t at all related to someone spoiling a manga panel thing. Now, the context, I knew nothing at the time he said it. And the tone was said in anger, worst tone to say a racist joke. Now, this isn’t me saying he wasn’t making a joke, but it was just a bad tasteless joke.

After a few minutes of me trying to think about what I heard, I just played video games. He then started to call him his friends in discord and started to go off on Ben. I just put on headphones, looked at the wall, and drifted to sleep as he played. But that joke isn’t what angered me, it made me uncomfortable but not angry.

Now, I woke up that morning and did my morning routine. Brushed, gym, shower, a bit of studying and I had a class canceled so an extra hour to relax. As I laid in bed, relaxing before my last class of the week, Mike was telling me about some friends at home. We then started to talking about Tim, mainly shit talking him.

I didn’t like it because to me, Tim is a great guy, I’d even consider him my best friend. He’s kind, smart, hard working, and very funny. Now, he can be a little too much but I am too, so we handle each other well. He went FAR away for college, but I still call him daily. It’s about 2-3 hour phone calls with each other.

So Mike went on to explain that he is just overall annoying then called him a racist… I argued against that, saying how he isn’t and Mike’s response was, “Do you know how many racist jokes he says?” Now here is when I started to get pissed off.

First of all, I hang out with Tim 10 times more than he has talked to him. I know that he doesn’t make a lot of those jokes and when he does, he has a bit of a funny reason that I will get to a bit. But once I said that I know he doesn’t say a lot, Mike said how I was wrong.

Second of all, Tim makes actual racist jokes and other fucked up jokes in good ways. Now, let me list how this is actually possible. First of all, he is encouraged by two of his black friends to love it because they say how he isn’t really that offensive (to them at least) and it’s hilarious. Even for the black people in our group to break out laughing when they hear his jokes.

Third of all, the first fucking part of this story. Another thing I hate about Mike, he’s a fucking hypocrite and talks shit about others. By the way, he knows he’s a hypocrite because he addresses it all the time, thinking that being aware of it makes him a better person and he doesn’t have to try to fix it.

I then went on my day with calling Tim and telling him about this for him to make creative and funny jokes about the situation. He then said how it’s okay, and I don’t need to be one to start unnecessary shit. I even told him Mike’s… joke which he found to be a little weirded out about.

Look, I know it’s not amazing that I’m defending racist jokes, and I can’t say I understand the harm they do to people of said race. I don’t really make these jokes myself due to the guilt I have of already laughing at them, but I honestly think that if the race of the people in the joke are laughing, then they happily understand the joke of it all.

64,1fndbk3,AITA for not making peace with my (23M) girlfriend's (23F) friend (23F) after she has held a grudge for two years?,"Me and my girlfriend have been together for 2.5 years. We met at the end of university and we had a few issues at the start of our relationship. These issues were made worse by various friend groups taking sides. However, since finishing university we have had a much more stable and positive relationship.

However, one of my girlfriend’s friends (whom I have only met a couple of times) has maintained some resentment towards me from this time. I was unaware of this until about one year into our relationship when I found out from my girlfriend that she still occasionally made comments about our past to my girlfriend as a sort of reminder that I’m not that great.

This friend has also made the claim that I have warped my girlfriend into being a worse person after she made a joke that the friend felt was inappropriate. This was rejected by my girlfriend at the time who insisted she had always been that way. I felt particularly targeted in this instance because this friend really doesn’t know me on a personal level.

All this has led to me having a pretty negative view of this girl. I can understand why she would still be cautious of me however I feel she has been undermining our relationship by so openly and repeatedly sharing her concerns about me with my girlfriend. 

This has also meant that in the few times I have actually been at events with this friend, I have felt rather unwanted and uncomfortable. This is especially true since she is the sort of loud and extroverted person to sort of take charge and do a lot of the talking at these events.

Anyway, the last few weeks have been a difficult time for my girlfriend as a result of some health issues. In this time I have been supportive and done what any boyfriend would do.

The other day her friend attempted to befriend me on social media. I was hesitant to accept because I still felt she had been treating me unfairly. However, she started pestering my girlfriend and asking why I hadn’t accepted it so I relented and, after talking it over with my girlfriend, sent her a message to clear the air and set out how I felt her actions had been unfair to me in the past.

This was met with a message from her which acknowledged there had been bad blood between us but that she wanted to have a fresh start. However, there was no acknowledgment of any wrongdoing.

I could have merely accepted this but I really felt as though she should have at least acknowledged that the way she had treated me and disrespected our relationship had been unfair. So I sent a slightly more argumentative message back which basically outlined all the bad things she had done.

This has angered my girlfriend who thinks I should have just accepted that she wanted a fresh start and moved on. However, I truly feel that she should at least acknowledge that she has been unfair to me and our relationship.

My parents have been separated since before I was born, I don't know exactly why, my mother never wanted to tell me the story. My father was a good father, until I was 5. He suddenly decided to move out of state and for some reason, his brain seemed to erase the information that he had children.

I remember always texting him asking when I could come see him, but they were always short replies with one excuse after another.There came a time when I got tired, no more messages, no more calls, nothing. Unlike him, I have always kept in touch with my paternal grandparents, they love me very much, just as I love them. I ended up mentioning that I was going to start college (I'm 18) and they were super happy for me. A few days later, my dad got my number and texted me asking about it. He asked me what career I wanted to have, if I liked it...he tried to start a conversation.

The point is, I don't feel comfortable. The last time I saw him, I was 5... It's just very weird. I feel like I'm talking to a stranger.

Like I said, he wasn't exactly a terrible father, always sending my mother money, doing his duty, but nothing more.He started helping me, but it started getting weird, he would only text me to talk about money, money, money. It seems like it's a burden to him now.But a few days ago, he showed immense interest in me and my life. I confess that I have not been the best of daughters, my answers are short and sharp.

And I have to confess, I have no intention of changing that. I spent my entire childhood dreaming of the day he would come back and I could finally be daddy's little girl.But he never came....

The thing is, I don't want to have any contact with him. The time when I needed a father is long gone. Not to mention that we're practically strangers.He doesn't know me, he doesn't know what I like, he doesn't know what my personality is like, and honestly, I prefer it that way. He abandoned my mother because of her personality, and unfortunately, we are very similar.

I don't want to have the chance to have him in my life again for him to leave. AGAIN. Maybe he wants to make up for the time he lost, but it's too late.

67,1fnd7dy,AITA for lying about my age to to my girlfriend,"
I (28M) grew up in a really unstable environment and ended up running away from home when I was a teenager. When I left, I decided to change my age as part of my escape. I wanted to create a new identity that would help me blend in and distance myself from my troubled past. After leaving, I got involved in some pretty dangerous activities, including being a drug dealer. It was a chaotic life, and I lost a lot of good years to that lifestyle. Eventually, I realized I wanted to turn things around and escape that world for good.


We met at a party where I was surrounded by friends who all knew me as this person i have become. It was my birthday, and when people asked how old I was turning, I confidently said I was 31. I didn't think much of it at the time—this is the person i had become and the person I have been for years. It felt like I was finally in a place where I could be happy and free from my past.

As we started dating, everything was going well. I really care about her, and she has no idea about my history. But now, as we’ve been discussing future plans—moving in together, maybe even getting engaged—I can’t shake the guilt. I know I’ve built this relationship on a lie, and I’m terrified of what will happen if she finds out the truth.

I’m actually 28, but for years I've been telling people I'm older. I ran away from home at 15 and needed to appear older to navigate life as an adult. As a result, everyone in my life thinks I'm 31, including my girlfriend (26F).",Asshole,2024-09-23,"AITA for lying about my age to to my girlfriend 
I (28M) grew up in a really unstable environment and ended up running away from home when I was a teenager. When I left, I decided to change my age as part of my escape. I wanted to create a new identity that would help me blend in and distance myself from my troubled past. After leaving, I got involved in some pretty dangerous activities, including being a drug dealer. It was a chaotic life, and I lost a lot of good years to that lifestyle. Eventually, I realized I wanted to turn things around and escape that world for good.


We met at a party where I was surrounded by friends who all knew me as this person i have become. It was my birthday, and when people asked how old I was turning, I confidently said I was 31. I didn't think much of it at the time—this is the person i had become and the person I have been for years. It felt like I was finally in a place where I could be happy and free from my past.

As we started dating, everything was going well. I really care about her, and she has no idea about my history. But now, as we’ve been discussing future plans—moving in together, maybe even getting engaged—I can’t shake the guilt. I know I’ve built this relationship on a lie, and I’m terrified of what will happen if she finds out the truth.

68,1fnd3ok,AITA if I don’t want to refund my friend for an Airbnb stay?,"In June, myself and three other people planned a girls trip to a city for my birthday. we had talked about this for months, so finally this past June we bought our Airbnb stay and all of us, but one person bought their flight tickets.

My friend, who was the only person who didn’t buy her plane ticket - let’s call her Gabriela, did pay for her part of the Airbnb ($700). At the time, Gabriela said she was having issues booking her flight online because she wanted to use her miles and couldn’t with her name change, fine. Well, she told me last week that she didn’t buy the ticket, and that her time off request was denied so she can’t go. Mind you, she’s a new mom and she had expressed some fear of leaving her child at home during this trip.  

Fine. I told her she didn’t have to come if she didn’t want to, but she insisted. 

Well… in the same message, Gabriela asked me for her money back for the Airbnb. I told her that if we cancelled the whole stay the group would lose out on 50% plus the service fee is non refundable. I explained this, and said she was sorry to hear, but she’s continued on with the viewpoint that I 
have her money, and to pay her back what is fair. She has consistently said to pay her back what is fair; although she doesn’t have an exact number. She said if it were her, she would ask the group to chip in to cover the cost if the same thing happened to her friend. I feel so uncomfortable dealing with this, and it’s making me feel like I’m stealing or keeping something that doesn’t belong to me. Please help!

69,1fnd3n5,AITA for not telling my friends I am technically our landlord?,"So I (18f) am very lucky in that I have two very hardworking parents that are successful and love me. We aren't mega-wealthy but we are very comfortable as my parents are extremely smart financially. We own multiple houses as part of our real estate portfolio that we rent out for extra income. I recently started college and as a present for working hard and getting into my dream school my parents gifted me one of our houses that is near my college. I was going to inherit them all anyway but I really appreciated their gesture. Where I live real estate law is a little tricky and we would have to pay significant taxes to officially transfer the house to me so we decided to have my parents own it legally for now.

The house is pretty big with 4 floors(including a fully furnished basement) and a roomy attic and since it is near my school I decided to look for roommates so I could start earning money early. So far I have two roommates, who we'll call Sasha(18f) and Bea(19f) who also go to my school. We have been living together for a couple months now(they moved in around August) and we are all pretty good friends, and very compatible roommates. This is where I might be the asshole. I didn't want to tell them that I own the house as I thought it might create a weird dynamic between us, and I didn't want them to view me any differently. We split the bills and rent, with me technically paying nothing. Since my father legally owns the house and we have different surnames(I took my mothers last name) they have no idea I own the house or that my dad just sends the money back to me.

Sasha recently found the money my dad sent back while I was at class and told Bea, and they cornered me about it a few days ago. I told them everything and they're mad at me for hiding this from them and think I'm not only in the wrong for keeping it a secret but for making them pay rent in the first place. The house's mortgage has already been paid off so the rent goes entirely into my pocket. I responded by saying that they shouldn't have gone through my mail in the first place and that it was illegal, which I'll admit was kind of a low blow. We weren't friends when they moved in and the whole point of me wanting roommates was so that I could earn extra cash so I don't see why I should let them reside for free.

AITA here?

Edit 1: people in the comments were asking, basically we have a system where whoever is home brings all the mail in and puts it on the kitchen island. Bea brought the mail in but Sasha opened my mail before I got home. My dad doesn't send me straight up cash lol, he mails two cheques, with the amount Sasha and Bea paid, and when Sasha saw the cheques from the landlord to me with the exact amount of her and Bea's rent she put two and two together and interrogated me when I came home. I don't know why she opened my mail in the first place, I've never noticed her snooping before but maybe she has and I just never saw.

Edit 2: ok answering a couple things I keep seeing in the comments. 

Yes I know the assets aren't technically mine but Inhave unlimited access to them, will inherit all of them one day(my parents have told me this directly it's not an assumption) and my parents consider it equally mine, so yes I consider them mine as well. I didn't earn them, I was just lucky enough to be born to amazing parents and I'm grateful to them for that. 

\*generic comment about evil landlords: Bea and Sasha are NOT poor, and I'm not charging way above market price. If they felt the price was too steep they could dorm which is actually cheaper or find a cheaper place. They are paying extra for luxury, I'm not exploiting broke children. 

Why use cheques instead of ebanking: I do all of my business online but my dad bought a fancy custom mailbox and he's trying(and failing) to concince my mom that it wasn't a waste so he likes to mail EVERYTHING now. I get letters instead of texts. Yes it's ridiculous and after this incident we'll definitely be doing our finances online only. 

I maintain that I'm not mega rich. Yes, I acknowledge that I'm extremely privileged compared to most other Americans but in my head at least mega rich is people like my boyfriend's family that own actual mansions, and have yachts, or like celebrities and billionaires with private jets etc. Compared to most of my friends I'm middle class. 

Why I changed my last name when I'm on good terms with my father: My parents are both British Indian immigrants, and my dad has a super ethnic and long hard to pronounce last name whereas my mom has a nice short and cute last name. When I apply for jobs people will judge me based on my name and I don't want that. My dad faced that discrimination and I grew up in a predominantly white community so I know people's perception of you change based on how American/white you are perceived to be. Also my mom went through labour and 9 months of pregnancy, she deserves to have her last name continued. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITA for not telling my friends I am technically our landlord?

He was so frustrated with me that he told me he doesn't want to see my face and left to go to a bar. About 2 hours later he came back after downing like seven beers and proceeded to blame me saying that if he got pulled over for drunk driving it would be my fault, that I'm also a worthless failure who is overconfident and doesn't deserve anything, and that it's because of me stopping him from having a beer that caused him to need so many. He berated me for like 45 minutes where I tried to patiently listen to him and told him he didn't need to be angry, but eventually my emotions got the best of me and I told him that I no longer love or care for him anymore because of what he puts me through.

Last week, my husband asked what I wanted for my birthday, and said I didn't need anything because we are broke, I just wanted cake. We spoke about the cakes I like and dislike. I reiterated that I don't like cheesecake though its common knowledge at this point. 

The night before my birthday, my parents watched the kids so my husband and I could go out to dinner and have a night to ourselves. At the restaurant, cheesecake was on the dessert menu and he commented on knowing which dessert I would not choose (the cheesecake). After dinner, we went home and planned to spend the day together with our kids and see a movie.

So, I wake up and today is my 40th birthday. My husband is still sleeping, so I go work out, get groceries, and do some chores. At 11 am he's still asleep. I decided to let him sleep and go get the kids. On my way to get them, he called me seemingly disappointed that I didn't wake him up and bring him.  

I said he looked tired and I didn't want to bug him (he has been working long, irregular hours). I figured I'd bring the kids home and then we'd all go to the movie. When we get home he is in the yard with a brand new chainsaw-cutting firewood. He's nowhere near ready to go to a movie. He finishes up, and at this point, the movie starts in 20 min.

Rather than communicating my feelings, I shut down and got quiet around him. He asked what was wrong and I said ""I just wanted a cake."" He got defensive and then rushed out saying he was driving to a city an hour away to get me a cake. I told him to come back, the kids wanted to see the movie. He refused because he needed to get me a cake. He said there was a later showing of the movie we could watch. 

He came back hours later, just a few minutes before we would need to leave for the later showing of the movie. He told the kids we were no longer going to the movie and that he brought home cake for my birthday. They whined and were disappointed so I said, no it's okay let's do the movie first. 

When we got home from the movie, I was walking down the hallway when he handed me a plate with four small desserts...one being a slice of cheesecake.

I met his family (dad, sister, and brother) for the first time when he was admitted into the hospital 2 years ago for Chemo treatment. They were really nice and respectful when I first met them/ they met me. 

Unfortunately things changed. His family pretty much abandoned my boyfriend. They were rarely at the hospital (when he was there) rarely kept in touch, I really didn't see or hear from them at all. I would also ask my partner if he's heard from them and he will tell me no. 

Fast forward my boyfriend was released from the hospital. My boyfriend and I never lived together but now we basically do. I moved in with him when he started getting more sick due to the cancer spreading/chemo not working. I do it all. The laundry, the errands, the groceries, the cleaning, ordering medications, taking him to his appointments, etc. I have no help. I've reached out numerous times via text to his family letting them know to come visit my partner because he misses his family and I need the help as well. I also work full time. 

My boyfriends dad and I got into it because I am fed up. He basically told me to never talk to him again and he's now blocked on my phone. I also have zero communication with this siblings.

As of now 2024 - my boyfriend is currently in Hospice. He needs help with everything and I am the only one to help. I recently received heartbreaking news from his nurse letting me know that I should start planning his funeral and make arrangements. I'm devastated. I'm mentally and physically exhausted. 

My boyfriends and I had a conversation on what his wishes are. He wants to be cremated. He asked me not to tell his family of his passing and he doesn't want any of them involved in any arrangements. 

Am I the asshole to not let my in-laws know of my boyfriends passing when that time comes? Or even ask them for help with funeral arrangements? 

Thx.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITAH for not letting my in-laws know about my BF’s passing when that time comes?

79,1fnbpnx,AITA for finding out my friends ring size?,"Hi Reddit, this is my first post so please cut me some slack. So basically, my friend Anna called me the other day telling me that my other friend Janes (names changed for obvious reasons) boyfriend texted her asking for Janes ring size. This is because he wants to get her a promise ring for her birthday in a couple weeks. Anna asked me for advice on how to find out Janes ring size without tipping her off. I gave Anna a couple of ideas like asking Jane her ring size because she wants to buy a ring but doesn’t know her ring size or just trying on one of Janes rings and guessing the ring sized based off of Annas finger. Eventually I told Anna that I could just find out her ring size as I live with Jane and it would probably be easier since she won’t have to go out of her way to do it. Jane seemed fine with the idea saying that if she couldn’t stop by soon that that would be fine. 

Well I found out Jane’s ring size by creating a story so she wouldn’t be suspicious. Once I got it, I sent it to Anna and told her the ring size and she asked me how I did it and her response after was “okay that slays”. I then sent it to the boyfriend to let him know and he basically gave me the same response that Anna did. Later I texted Anna and mentioned I sent him the ring size. She then responds to me 2 hours later basically saying “she appreciates that I got the ring size and all but she’s pissed because the boyfriend texted her asking for help and called me for advice. A quote of the message says “He texted ME and you just went ahead and did it” she then gave an example of if her boyfriend texted me and I told Jane and then Jane decided to do it would I be mad? 

She said the boyfriend asking her was important to her and that I took that away from her. I obviously feel bad that I hurt her and I truly didn’t mean to take away this special thing. I just don’t think I understand why she is so mad at me. Is it because I got the ring size instead of her? Or is it because I told the boyfriend instead of her? I would understand her being mad at me if she had told me that she wanted to do it herself and didn’t want me to do anything but she basically said it was fine for me to do it and then seemed fine when I told her the size?

81,1fnb7or,AITA for debriefing with my dad?,"TLDR: my mum secretly recorded my dad and I having a debrief and now thinks we are both assholes. 

Hi there

First time poster here. So basically, on Friday I (25F) went to my parents house to pick up a few things. My mum was on her way out but she seemed in a really bad mood, and like she was really annoyed at me. 

She left and my dad seemed stressed so I asked him why mum was in a bad mood and if she was mad at me. He told me that she wasn’t mad at me but just angry at him for something he isn’t sure what. That got us debriefing about the situation and a few other things including: 
- my mum making a comment a few weeks ago about me gaining weight even though I’ve struggled with an ED my entire life. 
- my mum being a bit controlling in some aspects of all of our lives 

The conversation wasn’t horrible at all, and these are all things we were planning on sharing with her, the timing just hasn’t been right for a number of reasons. I was only there for about 20 or so minutes and left. 

I noticed on Saturday she seemed off with me and was clearly arguing with my dad (we have a family group chat). She was also posting cryptic things on her Instagram stories about two-faced people. 

Long story short, we figured out she had left her iPad secretly recording our conversation after she’d left that afternoon. So she heard everything we said. We found out because my older sister saw her Instagram stories and asked what was up and my mum told her everything.

Personally, I think it’s normal to debrief and why can’t I have a conversation with my dad about things that are frustrating us? She has also ranted to me in the past about my dad. It’s never anything horrible, and we always end up addressing it. It’s just a way we can vent our frustrations so when we do address it, it’s calm and non-aggressive in nature. 

She did the very same thing with my sister - she told her and showed her the recording before telling my dad and I because she wanted to speak to someone else first, which is fair. My sister is in agreement with my dad and I on the matter. 

My mum is making out like my dad and I are awful people and like we are ganging up on her. AITA?? Be honest as I genuinely do want different perspectives.

84,1fnaydp,AITAH For Not Going To My Twin Niece's Birthday Party?,"Today was my twin nieces birthday party and I didn't go. I didn't go because I didn't want to see my older sister, I didn't want to feel like I was betraying my mom and also cause it was sprung up on me last second. There are many many reasons why I don't want to see my older sister but here are the main reasons.

#1.

She has teamed up with my mom's ex to accuse my mom of being a cheating, drunken, abusive and neglectful partner and parent despite no such things being true at all. Keep in mind she's spreading these rumors to all of our relatives, my moms friends and also my moms bf. They also tried to bribe me and my siblings with money to turn on my mom.

#2.

Accused my mom of being a narcicist fo the fact that going through CHEMOtherapy was hard for her even though my dad also did CHEMO and he died of cancer rather than surviving it like my mom.

#3.

Accused me and my little sister of being groomers that put thoughts into her oldest daughters head because we're queer and her daughter is sexually promiscuous. This is despite the fact that the reason she's that way is cause my older sister kept leaving her phone with her and her husbands nudes out in the open unlocked and she has seen her dads and her moms nudes a lot cause of that.

#4.

Told my older brother that he wasn't my dad's son and basically tried to get him in touch with his ""real family"" who are a bunch of, and I'm not exaggerating, crack addicts.

This has been all just in the past year or so. This is the worst it's ever been but she's always been like this where she's fine one second and then the next for three months plus or so she's telling everybody you're a psychopath and blocks you on everything but also makes alternate accounts to still view your posts like a psycho.

I think it's pretty clear why I don't want to see her. She kept all info regarding my nieces and nephews from me, my mom and my little sister so I didn't know it was my twin nieces birthday so I had no way of knowing. Then next thing you know I'm being told out of nowhere that I have an hour and half to prepare to see my psychopathic older sister who's been slandering me, my mom and my little sister for over a year now. I had no time to sort my thoughts or anything. She apparently wanted to see me to apologise but I didn't want an apology that I knew would be null and void give or take a couple months or so.

Today was my twin nieces birthday party and I didn't go. I didn't go because I didn't want to see my older sister, I didn't want to feel like I was betraying my mom and also cause it was sprung up on me last second. There are many many reasons why I don't want to see my older sister but here are the main reasons.

#1.

She has teamed up with my mom's ex to accuse my mom of being a cheating, drunken, abusive and neglectful partner and parent despite no such things being true at all. Keep in mind she's spreading these rumors to all of our relatives, my moms friends and also my moms bf. They also tried to bribe me and my siblings with money to turn on my mom.

#2.

Accused my mom of being a narcicist fo the fact that going through CHEMOtherapy was hard for her even though my dad also did CHEMO and he died of cancer rather than surviving it like my mom.

#3.

Accused me and my little sister of being groomers that put thoughts into her oldest daughters head because we're queer and her daughter is sexually promiscuous. This is despite the fact that the reason she's that way is cause my older sister kept leaving her phone with her and her husbands nudes out in the open unlocked and she has seen her dads and her moms nudes a lot cause of that.

#4.

Told my older brother that he wasn't my dad's son and basically tried to get him in touch with his ""real family"" who are a bunch of, and I'm not exaggerating, crack addicts.

This has been all just in the past year or so. This is the worst it's ever been but she's always been like this where she's fine one second and then the next for three months plus or so she's telling everybody you're a psychopath and blocks you on everything but also makes alternate accounts to still view your posts like a psycho.

I think it's pretty clear why I don't want to see her. She kept all info regarding my nieces and nephews from me, my mom and my little sister so I didn't know it was my twin nieces birthday so I had no way of knowing. Then next thing you know I'm being told out of nowhere that I have an hour and half to prepare to see my psychopathic older sister who's been slandering me, my mom and my little sister for over a year now. I had no time to sort my thoughts or anything. She apparently wanted to see me to apologise but I didn't want an apology that I knew would be null and void give or take a couple months or so.

85,1fnavtd,AITA for asking for more money at a job I don't work at?,"Hi, this is my first time writing one of these so bear with me lol.

For a year now, I (F18) have been spending my afternoons after school at the school my mom works at. It's a private Montessori school where a lot of wealthy families in my area send their children. I love spending time there and getting to know the kids and has grown my interest in teaching. I usually work the aftercare program some days with my mom but I don't get paid for it since I can leave at any time and go to another classroom and do my homework. But, I usually stay and don't mind cause a handful of the staff don't really keep an eye on the kids. 

Two weeks ago, one of the teachers, let's call her Andrea, asked me if I could help out with her afterschool club instead of doing aftercare and guaranteed I get paid. Now Andrea is not the best person. She refuses to do aftercare and barely helps out other teachers. But I felt bad since she had 26 three to five-year-olds in her club, so it was the least I could do, and took the offer. Big mistake. 

Once Andrea explained with we would be doing in the club that day to the students, she literally got up and left me alone with them. I was never so stressed in my life. She only poked her head in the doorway two times for the whole hour-and-a-half club and came back when it was for dismissal. About 10 minutes later, Andrea came up to me and ""apologized"" for leaving me alone and she ""had to take a phone call.""(She was not on her phone once.) After I brushed it off, she handed me “half"" of the earnings she made for the club which was 100 dollars.

Not to sound greedy, but I knew 100 dollars wasn't enough. So, after I got home I asked my mom how the paying system for all the clubs works. My mom said that each club ranges from 300-350 dollars and the teacher running it gets all the profit. I swear to God, I thought the bottom of my mouth was gonna fall off. I asked how much Andrea's club cost and my mom said 350 dollars. I absolutely lost it. Andrea dicked around that day and made $9100 and I only got paid 100. 

My mom is upset. Teachers I got to know very well are upset. Even the teacher who is in charge of confirming the clubs is upset. I wanna confront Andrea so bad but, I don't wanna come off as an asshole for asking for more money at a job I don't work at. So, am I an asshole and what should I do? Any advice is helpful :)",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITA for asking for more money at a job I don't work at? Hi, this is my first time writing one of these so bear with me lol.

86,1fnatwh,AITA For Being Happy in My Marriage When my Sibling Is Depressed Over His Break-Up,"My wife (32F) and I (35M) have been together for over five years and we just celebrated our first wedding anniversary. On top of that we have our first baby due in a few months, something that most of our families seem over the moon about, with the exception of my brother (29M).

Until recently he was engaged to his partner, but due to a set of circumstances that were at least partially his fault it ended in a rather ugly break-up with him moving back in with my parents for the time being.  

I’m not qualified to diagnose any mental conditions, but I can say from years of personal experience that he has some pretty major anger management problems; and when he gets upset he tends to lash out at family members and make very impulsive decisions. 

The other day my wife and I invited my parents out to dinner. They brought my brother along as well, we didn’t specifically invite him but were originally fine with him joining because he’s family.

Naturally the topic of conversation was largely around the upcoming baby, the anniversary trip we’d just returned from, etc.  And while I understand that these can be triggering topics for someone undergoing a break-up, it’s also the main topic these very excited first-time grandparents want to discuss when we get together nowadays, AND we had specifically invited them out to talk about baby stuff.

My brother was quiet and cold to us and then angrily stormed out of the restaurant. He returned when the waiter brought out his order and he ate it in silence, and then stormed out again. When we left we just saw him sitting with his back against my parent’s car scowling at us.

We chose not to engage him at that time because he was clearly hoping to elicit a reaction, and we just went home.  He later group texted us a long screed about how unfair it is that we’re so happy and living our best lives while he is so miserable.  We responded that we understand if that’s a trigger for him and in the future he should not feel obligated to join us if doing so causes negative feelings for him (mind you he had invited himself to this dinner in the first place).

I completely empathize with his situation and I can’t begin to understand how traumatizing it can be to end an engagement. We’ve tried to show him empathy but it’s difficult to speak with him about these topics because he is someone you often need to walk on eggshells around to prevent him from lashing out at you. 

After this incident, my wife and I plan on keeping a healthy distance from my brother until he commits to getting his anger issues under control and to working with a psychiatric professional (he already speaks with a counselor but not someone who can prescribe him medications if necessary), as this stress is not good for the pregnancy. We also worry about him being around the baby when he can’t control his emotions.

87,1fnan2t,WIBTA if I reported my roommate for smoking in our no smoking apartment? ,"My (22 M) roommates at university were randomly assigned to me, I had never met them before we moved in together. I still haven’t seen or spoken to one of them, but I hear him and boy do I smell him. He is constantly smoking marijuana or weed or whatever you want to call it, and coughing in his room. 

For context, marijuana is illegal in my state, and the lease states that smoking is not allowed here, technically smoking isn’t even allowed anywhere near the complex because it’s on campus, which is a no smoking campus, you can’t even smoke cigarettes around here. I chose to live here for a reason. 

I hate the smell and he keeps me up at night with his coughing. I can easily report him to the school and have him removed, but that would probably be devastating for him. At the same time, he didn’t even ask me or our other roommate if it was okay if he smoked in here, and even if we allowed it, it’s directly violating the lease and breaking the law. 

Not only is it extremely annoying, but I am worried that the smoke will cause damage or someone else will report him, and I will face consequences for his actions. He’s already set the fire alarm off and caused an evacuation once. 

WIBTA if I reported him for this blatant ignorance of other’s feelings, the lease, and the law? 

UPDATE: hey guys I haven’t had the chance to read through all the comments, but when I made this post I was really upset and have since calmed down. I’m going to talk to him and come up with some compromise. It wouldn’t be as bad if he only smoked out of a pen inside our place. As a fellow student I understand he might just be coping with stress and I wouldn’t want to make that worse for him. If he doesn’t want to compromise I would reconsider the report but I don’t think that should be my first course of action. Thank you for all the replies.

89,1fna9r6,AITA I am keeping my neighbors cat ,"keep my neighbors cat

So this is quit a story! My neighbors cat (orange girl who’s reaching older age very lovely) has been wondering the neighborhood for a while, when I noticed she looked skinny I started feeding her my neighbors said nothing and laughed at it. When winter rolled around I found her hiding under our car in the middle of a snow storm. She had a frostbite nose it was awful, I called my neighbor and she came to get her and laughed it off. During the winter and into the spring the cat had been staying out of thier house late at night and during much of the day, I was worried about her she is getting older. So I got her a cat house and explained to my neighbors that she should be watched more carefully, again they kind of brushed it off and laughed at the cat house. Eventually tic season came around and you gussed it she got a tic. I texted my neighbor and asked if she had received her tic meds, she had not and she hadn’t even gotten that medication. I didn’t ask and I know it’s rude but I gave her some tic medicine and it seemed to help. Soon I noticed she was kind of skinny so I fed her breakfast and dinner ( I’ve been over to baby sit for these neighbors I know they only food they have for the cat is dog food or on occasion kitten food, she dosnt even have a bowl) the cat soon really grew to be comfortable around me and enjoyed making biscuits on the front porch and butting my head, so one night in July while the fireworks went off and she was terrified I let her in. She spent the night and the morning in my house and she relaxed so so much I’ve never seen her that at easie. It had been a full day and night and my neighbor never once texted the group chat to ask where the cat was. I kept her in again only during the night and let her wonder the day, no text from neighbors. The summer heat reached 100+ so I kept her in most of the day and night still no text. It has been a few months at this point no text no knock on door nothing! I eventually text my neighbor asking if the cat has ever received her vaccination ( I was going to take her to the vet for her own health) and I received no text, the next day after that text they send a note to my door asking for the cat back because thier son missed her coming home at night, they then showed up, I explained everything they laughed took the cat and I haven’t seen her. I know those kids, they did not care for that cat they like thier dogs, that cat barely tolerated the kids. My problem is it had been MONTHS of dead silence even after I asked multiple times on the safty of the cat. I don’t know what to do. I know she’s not being fed well and she might run away agin. I want to report them and take her back but maybe I’m over reacting",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"AITA I am keeping my neighbors cat  keep my neighbors cat

92,1fna4qk,WIBTA if I hung out with my ex's friends even though he asked me not to?,"My ex Matthew (19m) and I (19f) are both sophomores at a small liberal arts school. We met in our first year seminar and started dating in November. We were together for ten months and were very committed to one another. The first few months were basically perfect – things started going downhill around March because we were both struggling with substance abuse issues. I was able to cut back on drinking eventually but he kept getting blackout drunk basically every night. After a period of growing resentment, communication issues, and just generally neither of us being very good partners to the other, we decided last week that we needed time take a break so that he can help for his drinking. There's a lot of love there and I'm honestly just happy to have him in my life. 

The issue is with our friends. As mentioned, we go to a very small school, and most of the second years live in the same dorm, including us and most of our friends. Right after we started dating, he introduced me to his friends, and while most of them are definitely more his friends than mine, we've all become quite close over the last year and at this point I've probably spent almost as much time with them as he has. After we broke up, however, he asked if I could sit out pre-games and hangouts at the quad for a while. He said it would be too sad for him because we've always hung out with his friends as a couple. 

I agreed but internally I'm a bit annoyed over this because he's essentially cutting me off from my community. He was the one who was always inviting me to hang out with him and his friends last year, and he very much facilitated my presence as a part of the friend group rather than just his girlfriend who hangs around sometimes. A few of his friends and I were even planning on starting a band. Given, I haven't hung out one-on-one with many of them, but neither has he since we almost always hang out as a group. 

He also asked me not to tell his friends that he said not to come to hangouts because he didn't want them to think we were on bad terms. Whenever I see his friends or quadmates in the hall, they usually say they miss me or ask why I don't come to pre's anymore and it breaks my heart to have to lie to them, I'm worried they're going to think I never liked them and only came to hang out because I was dating Matthew.

Would I be putting him in an unfair position if I asked him to include me in hangouts or to hang out with them even though he asked me not to? I don't really have other friends since I spent most of my time with them last year (he knows this) and I've basically been wasting away in my dorm. On the other hand, I don't want to overstep his boundary, even though I feel like this particular boundary extends beyond him since he's basically severing my ties to the people I've come to know and love over the past year. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-23,"WIBTA if I hung out with my ex's friends even though he asked me not to? My ex Matthew (19m) and I (19f) are both sophomores at a small liberal arts school. We met in our first year seminar and started dating in November. We were together for ten months and were very committed to one another. The first few months were basically perfect – things started going downhill around March because we were both struggling with substance abuse issues. I was able to cut back on drinking eventually but he kept getting blackout drunk basically every night. After a period of growing resentment, communication issues, and just generally neither of us being very good partners to the other, we decided last week that we needed time take a break so that he can help for his drinking. There's a lot of love there and I'm honestly just happy to have him in my life. 

The issue is with our friends. As mentioned, we go to a very small school, and most of the second years live in the same dorm, including us and most of our friends. Right after we started dating, he introduced me to his friends, and while most of them are definitely more his friends than mine, we've all become quite close over the last year and at this point I've probably spent almost as much time with them as he has. After we broke up, however, he asked if I could sit out pre-games and hangouts at the quad for a while. He said it would be too sad for him because we've always hung out with his friends as a couple. 

I agreed but internally I'm a bit annoyed over this because he's essentially cutting me off from my community. He was the one who was always inviting me to hang out with him and his friends last year, and he very much facilitated my presence as a part of the friend group rather than just his girlfriend who hangs around sometimes. A few of his friends and I were even planning on starting a band. Given, I haven't hung out one-on-one with many of them, but neither has he since we almost always hang out as a group. 

He also asked me not to tell his friends that he said not to come to hangouts because he didn't want them to think we were on bad terms. Whenever I see his friends or quadmates in the hall, they usually say they miss me or ask why I don't come to pre's anymore and it breaks my heart to have to lie to them, I'm worried they're going to think I never liked them and only came to hang out because I was dating Matthew.

Would I be putting him in an unfair position if I asked him to include me in hangouts or to hang out with them even though he asked me not to? I don't really have other friends since I spent most of my time with them last year (he knows this) and I've basically been wasting away in my dorm. On the other hand, I don't want to overstep his boundary, even though I feel like this particular boundary extends beyond him since he's basically severing my ties to the people I've come to know and love over the past year.

93,1fn9ylr,AITA for not returning our new mattress? Wife has “moved” to guest room.,"Just scored a sweet deal on a Sleep Number bed and my wife refuses to download the app to set up her side. When I tried to do it for her, she “didn’t like me standing over her” and told me to just leave it.

She woke up the other day complaining her back was sore and asking about the return policy. I firmly told her that until she actually tries to adjust it and sleep on it for a few weeks, that I wouldn’t be returning it.

This is the 3rd different mattress we have tried in the last year. She previously expressed interest in a similar bed from another brand, but did give the green light on getting the one we did.

96,1fn9b49,AITA for making my autistic friend go nonverbal for a week?,"I Abby (14 F) have been friends with Joy (14 F) since 4th grade. Lately, things have gotten really strained. About a year ago, Joy yelled in public that I liked a boy from school, leading to harassment from other boys. When we got back, I told her, “I didn’t want my personal information shared like that.” I thought we had a mutual understanding, but it only got worse.

In high school, she continued to make insensitive remarks. She joked loudly in class about my past mental health issues. Each incident felt like a betrayal, and I became more uncomfortable around her. After she publicly called a friend of mine a drug dealer, I decided to set boundaries again. I texted her, “When you talk about my personal stuff in public, it makes me uncomfortable. I’d appreciate it if we could keep those details private.”

When she didn’t respond, I felt even more isolated. I reached out again, hoping to talk things through, but she still ignored me. I noticed she was chatting with our other friends, which hurt even more.

Finally, I confronted Joy directly. I told her how I was feeling and how I just wanted to say anything. She looked indifferent, and our teacher overheard and offered me a hug.

Then my friend Maddy texted Joy, saying, ""Hey Joy, I don’t know if you have my contact saved, and honestly, I don’t care. I just wanted to say that ignoring Abby is pretty childish.

98,1fn91gi,WIBTA for using my BabyMoon money fund for a bachelor party?,"This might seem kind of messed up and I’ve gotten mixed reviews from my family but here I go.

Within the last 4 months me (m24) and my gf (29) got engaged and pregnant. We are super excited and ready to start our lives together. I didn’t expect to have a child at this point of my life but here we are lol. My gf made a registry where we are getting donations to our babymoon fund, we are just skipping a honeymoon. My gf just decided that she doesn’t really want to travel before she gives birth. I totally get it… I’m a little upset because it was going to be our babymoon/ honeymoon but I understand. 

After some talking we decided that we will have bachelor and bachelorette parties. She wants to be local but I never got that college party experience (I know she has). I had this plan to go with some friends but I don’t have much money at the moment. My dad jokingly brought up the idea of using money that was donated to our baby moon ($600) that her uncle sent us to use on my bach trip . I actually kind of think it’s a good idea. My gf said she doesn’t really care and doesn’t want the money going to waste and that I have her blessing. I’m hoping to just get an air bnb in Texas for a few nights and checking out goth hooters, I’m not planning on going to crazy. 

My mom was pissed about the idea. I
Haven’t talk to her uncle about it but I did talk to
Her dad and brother and they both would be coming on the trip if I can use that money.

Would I be an asshole if i use the baby moon money? Would it be better or less of an asshole move if I invite her uncle? He lives in Texas and actually recommended goth hooters when I met him last Thanksgiving. 

Update: just to clarify. The only person to donate was her uncle, so it wasn’t anyone else. 

After seeing some of the comments this morning. I decided the best thing to do would be to contact her uncle about it. I know babies cost a lot of money but if I don’t do this I know I’ll regret it. I haven’t really enjoyed my young adult life.. I’ve been working a lot and hard. and I just need one time to be about me. I’m going to be a great and loving dad but I have to have one last party at goth hooters. It’s not like I’m getting stupid drunk at a strip club. 

I’ll let everyone know what he says

He said he’d prefer that I only use half of that money and I can either borrow money from him and pay him back later or I can pay the other half myself.

Now, for some context: 
I (41F) an my husband (38M) have been married for 10 years. We have two beautiful children (9M and 4F) and we used to live in a big city, where we both had great jobs (I worked at a law firm, my Hb was a chef at a restaurant) but the life we could provide to our kids was a city life, in an apartment, with no close family living in the same city. That meant that we had a nanny, and my MIL said a few too many times that the nanny was raising the kids. After the isolation of 2020, almost all my work could be done from home, and we decided to move to his home town, one of the reasons was ""to be close to his family"" (and closer to mine as well, even though my family lives about 2 hours away from this city).  So we decided to move, I quit my job and started my own law firm, and we bought a restaurant. We are in a much more stable economic situation, but, and this is a very big BUT,  the amount of work I have now that I work from home, is twice or three times the work I had before. I have a home office, and the kids don't need a nanny anymore, but I am working while cooking, having them ready for school, driving them to and from school and other activities. Seriously, I am exhausted. 
Now to the story:
My hb went on a vacation with one of his friends for a week. I was alone with my kids, and on the second day of his vacation, I had a work related emergency, and I had to travel to another state (600 km away) for a day to ensure one of my clients stayed away from prison. So I talked to my MIL and asked her to take care of our kids for the day, I would be away exactly 26 hours. She said she wouldn't do it because she couldn't leave her dogs alone, and that she could take care of them during the day, but not at night. 
I was very upset that my kids were less important than her dogs, but I said nothing to her, and just got my kid in the bus with me. My hb asked me why I took the kids on the trip, it was very expensive, so I told him what happened. 
When he came back, he went to his mom's home, and she said that she told me she was going to take care of the kids, and that I lied about the dogs and everything. And then he told me that he didn't know what happened, because we told him two different things. 
I was really upset, and told him that if he didn't know what happened, after I told him exactly what happened, it was because he believes his mother instead of believing me, and that if after all this time he doesn't know that I never lie, our marriage is not in a good place. 
After talking to my BFF, she said that even though I was right to be upset with him, I was putting him in an awkward position, forcing him to choose between his mother and his wife.

100,1fn7tn8,AITA for not siding with my friend during a disagreement?,"me (15f) and my friend ryan (15m) have a mutual friend tiffany and he brought up the idea of wanting to plan her a bday party. we made a short list of people who we wanted to invite to this outing, most of which were mutual friends with one another. i recently became friends w/this girl named julia (16f) but wasn't sure if i should invite her. it was ryan's idea to invite julia because we knew her.



ryan told me to text julia the details for the party. julia seemed down, but once i mentioned who was going she became a bit hesitant. she said she was only willing to go if i were to go since she didn't talk to the other people going. she said she would obviously be at the party for tiffany but she feels like “(tiffany) would be talking to ryan most of the time"" so ultimately she would want me at the party to not feel left out.



when i told ryan during class, he basically went on a rant on how he didn't understand why julia's 'requirement' to go to the bday party was if i went. he wanted people to go for tiffany, not just because someone else was going. i told him that julia would've felt awkward since she didn't know that many people going. i also told ryan that assuming him and tiffany would spend the most time together during the party makes sense since they're the closest. this would leave julia with less time to spend with tiffany. ryan made a weird face at this comment. he mentioned how in arguments involving him and someone else i tend to side with the other person instead of him. he brought up this pattern during the argument. i told him how i dont intentionally pick a side that's against him, i just pick the side i believe is more rational. i found it weird how much he cared about a bday party that wasnt his. tiffany didn't really care about whether or not julia was going, she just wanted people to feel comfortable. 



at this point i told him to just talk to julia himself. he said ""you tell her, since you're like closer with her, you know?"". he wanted me to be a messenger between them. i gave julia a summary of what happened and she also agreed that he was being irrational. this dude was also the same dude who told me how much he ""hates petty drama"";how ironic



after a few days, ryan had cut off contact with me, stopped walking with me to class, stopped texting me, etc. this argument caused a 7 month break in our friendship all because i sided with julia instead. this happened a while ago, me and ryan are friends again.



AITA for not taking ryan's side and instead taking julia's?

if you were wondering: no. the birthday party never happened. the plan fell apart a few days later.

",No A-holes here,2024-09-23,"AITA for not siding with my friend during a disagreement? me (15f) and my friend ryan (15m) have a mutual friend tiffany and he brought up the idea of wanting to plan her a bday party. we made a short list of people who we wanted to invite to this outing, most of which were mutual friends with one another. i recently became friends w/this girl named julia (16f) but wasn't sure if i should invite her. it was ryan's idea to invite julia because we knew her.

101,1fn7km7,AITA for calling out on my friend behaviour.," My friend and I, we're both females (she 29) (I'm 32.) I met her a long time ago playing hockey. 🏒  we were from different schools, she came up, and spoke to me. calling me a werido, because I was knitting a scarf, and called me old fashioned, and since than we been friend's for over 20 years. Fast track to mid 2000s  we both ended in the same high school but I didn't get to finished year 7 because my parents sold the business, and we  were moving away to a new town to help out my grandmother who was very sick. So we promised to keep in touch, and this was way before many people had phones or internet access.  As we been writing back and forth. And we finally convinced her to move to my new town. Mainly the fact she started sleeping with my male friend. We all gamer's  and met at my house. Fast forward again the ended up dating each other. But happiness doesn't last forever. The both ended up having cooling of period because the both were texting other people behind there backs. My male friend and I found out she was sleeping with him, and his brother in the same bed. Meanwhile there were sharing house with one other male. That turned Into a messy brake up. And I got stuck in the middle of my two best friends the dude I only know for 4 years of the time and my female friend I known for 20 years. While I ended up I'm hospital from a surgery the left me in a sleeping state for 2 months I found out everyone block me. And made up rumours about me. So a few  month after surger once I was able to talk again.  I learnt a ton of shit what's been happening between the two who used to date. She ended up with his brother. And my male friend with another chick. And me so called female friends spreading lies about me. So I ended up calling children services on her. And this was when she only had one kid at the time.  Because she a x junkie and a pot head. The child was taken and giving to her mum. She had to prove to children services she won't do drugs and drinking alcohol again.  And somehow managed to get her child back. Side note she doesn't look after her kid and rather get tattoos than buy the kids food or feed him.
Since children services has come into play she has started taking parenting classes and becoming a better mum to her child.
