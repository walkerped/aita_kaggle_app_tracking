At this time, I had chosen to not tell my mother, as I was mostly afraid of how she would react.

About a month after coming out to my wife and friends, I finally felt confident enough to tell her, and things went about as poorly as I expected them to. She definitely was not happy with the idea, going very much out of her way to explain how she ""never saw it when I was young"" and that I should just be a ""feminine man"" because I've never been that ""manly"" anyhow... (I don't understand this contradiction either) She went on to tell me that she'll always be there for me, but she just thinks I'm making a huge mistake and that I should be smarter than that.

The conversation ended there, but since then I've noticed very much that she calls me ""boy"", which she has always done on occasion, but now exclusively so. Not wanting to cause conflict I just chose to kind of ignore it, and hope it would eventually cease.

More recently, I have started to medically transition, I have not told my mother this, and have begun to accept myself more and be more open about who I am, and honestly I've never felt happier. This even culminated in attending a wedding where I was invited with my preferred name and not only allowed to present feminine, but was encouraged to do so by the bride and groom as it would be a safe and inclusive space.

Well, my mother has found out about this, and it definitely not something she wanted. When talking with here today she repeatedly made sure to tell me I was only ""dressing as a woman"", and that I'm ""Never going to be an attractive woman"" as well as once again trying to push back and tell me that it's dumb to come out at my age. She further went on to say ""I gave birth to a son, and it isn't fair of you to take that away from me. It feels like you are destroying something I created. I'm allowed to have feelings and you won't tell me how to feel"" amongst many other things that just came across as unbelievably hurtful.

I really don't like being aggressive, but something in me actually snapped. I cut off her talking and asked her why I was born in the first place, asking her why a lesbian has a biological child and had a husband for so many years. I reminded her that she came out as a lesbian at literally the same age I came out as trans, and it's only natural that I was afraid based on how she's reacting. Finally I asked her how she even knew she was a lesbian, maybe she should just find a ""feminine man"" to date.

It was at this point she got really upset with me, calling me TA and telling me that I'm being absolutely disrespectful. My wife is telling me I did nothing wrong, and that if my mother can't take it, she shouldn't dish it out, but I really feel bad about being mean to my mom. It's not like she's been a bad mother up to this point, she's normally great.
