0,1fo1ikx,"AITA For Telling My Mom To Date ""Feminine Men""?","So, a few months ago I finally built up to courage to come out as Transgenger (MtF), and told my wife and select friends that I intended to actually medically transition. At this time, I had chosen to not tell my mother, as I was mostly afraid of how she would react.

About a month after coming out to my wife and friends, I finally felt confident enough to tell her, and things went about as poorly as I expected them to. She definitely was not happy with the idea, going very much out of her way to explain how she ""never saw it when I was young"" and that I should just be a ""feminine man"" because I've never been that ""manly"" anyhow... (I don't understand this contradiction either) She went on to tell me that she'll always be there for me, but she just thinks I'm making a huge mistake and that I should be smarter than that.

The conversation ended there, but since then I've noticed very much that she calls me ""boy"", which she has always done on occasion, but now exclusively so. Not wanting to cause conflict I just chose to kind of ignore it, and hope it would eventually cease.

More recently, I have started to medically transition, I have not told my mother this, and have begun to accept myself more and be more open about who I am, and honestly I've never felt happier. This even culminated in attending a wedding where I was invited with my preferred name and not only allowed to present feminine, but was encouraged to do so by the bride and groom as it would be a safe and inclusive space.

Well, my mother has found out about this, and it definitely not something she wanted. When talking with here today she repeatedly made sure to tell me I was only ""dressing as a woman"", and that I'm ""Never going to be an attractive woman"" as well as once again trying to push back and tell me that it's dumb to come out at my age. She further went on to say ""I gave birth to a son, and it isn't fair of you to take that away from me. It feels like you are destroying something I created. I'm allowed to have feelings and you won't tell me how to feel"" amongst many other things that just came across as unbelievably hurtful.

I really don't like being aggressive, but something in me actually snapped. I cut off her talking and asked her why I was born in the first place, asking her why a lesbian has a biological child and had a husband for so many years. I reminded her that she came out as a lesbian at literally the same age I came out as trans, and it's only natural that I was afraid based on how she's reacting. Finally I asked her how she even knew she was a lesbian, maybe she should just find a ""feminine man"" to date.

It was at this point she got really upset with me, calling me TA and telling me that I'm being absolutely disrespectful. My wife is telling me I did nothing wrong, and that if my mother can't take it, she shouldn't dish it out, but I really feel bad about being mean to my mom. It's not like she's been a bad mother up to this point, she's normally great.

2,1folenp,AITA for hogging a hammock?,"Hello!

My husband and I are on a cruise and just experienced something really strange, wanted to check with people here to see if we’re really in the wrong.

Yesterday was day 1 of five sea days. We are kind of early risers because the cruise is 5 hours behind our normal time, but are getting up and getting breakfast around 8 AM and settling into our spots around 9 AM ship time.

There’s a couple really cute hammocks with sheets that you can lay in, and yesterday we spent almost the entire day admittedly alternating between reading and napping in the hammock. We’d get up and go do trivia or game shows for 1-2 hours at a time and we’d take all of our stuff and go. If we’re just running to grab food, drinks, or bathroom and come back, we leave our stuff.

This morning, we got up at normal time, had breakfast, came around 9:30 and no one was using it. We laid in it for a few hours, grabbed our stuff and left for trivia for 30 minutes. When we came back, it still wasn’t being used, I sat down and some lady asks if I’m going to be here all day.

I thought she was joking about vacation time o I shrugged and said I wasn’t sure, and then she starts yelling at me about how we used it all day yesterday and we’re hogging it so we should let someone else use it. She was really rude and everyone was staring at us. My husband and I tried to explain there were other hammocks around the ship she could use but she said we were still wrong for hogging it.

I got mad and told her that I just might use it all day, she flipped me off and stormed away. 

But isn’t that kind of what people do  at resorts/vacations? You kind of pick a spot and hang out there most of the day?

We haven’t been getting up particularly early for it, we mosey over to it, and leave a few times during the day. I’m not sure what we should be doing differently. I don’t see the sense in leaving it unused when we see it not being used just in case someone else walks by and wants it? Why can’t we just use it if we get up multiple times a day and leave it open, but keep coming back to it being empty?

Open to how to be polite and considerate to other guests while also maximizing my ability to live my best life because in all honesty I love the hammock and it’s so comfy 😂. It’s day 2/5 sea days so definitely wanting to get along and make the most of it. One couple near by really supported us, but the others a bit further away gave us really dirty looks. 

If she had just asked me for it, or asked if we could trade out later, I would have given it to her. I do pride myself on being a super nice person and wanting to get along with others. I told the couple that supported us if they wanted it, to just let me know and they said they might later.

Now it just feels weird because I feel like I’m doing something wrong laying here, but I also don’t want to give in to her and just leave the hammock especially because no one else has used it the other times we’ve left it.

I did it for 4 months, each month editing 15 clips (one month being 19 clips instead of 15).

However, only around 6-7 out of the 64 clips we're tagged with my @ (they instead put my @ on only one social with the title \[Editor: @\], because ""so I don't have to keep @ ing you on every post"", their words), only around 10-12 clips we're used at all so far, the pay decreased towards the end and even switched to a minimum wage rate with clocking, re-edits we're often requested, and my work had also been edited over. (I shall also mention that the short formatted videos are 100% not their main content. Their main content is long form videos and Twitch streams)

The first two months had the most hours of work due to being tasked with skimming 2-3hr VODs, then it decreased slightly with pre-trimmed Twitch Clips by users. However, even with Twitch Clips easing the skimming, I still had to go through VODs to collect context for certain things. Recourse gathering essentially.

So..

Upon getting the 5th request for more clips AND re-edits, I went ahead and politely quit editing for them- specifically the short formatted content. I explained my issues (as stated up top), offered my help for anything else if need be, just not the short formatted content.

Their response was interesting and is the whole reason why I am posting here. They expressed a lot of disappointment- even asking if I could at least fix up/re-edit a few of the last clips due to 'lack of context' (which would require skimming through VODs and reediting those clips entirely. As my original project was deleted after I was paid and got the all clear that the 4th round of clips were satisfactory, which obviously they didn't check before paying me) so I also declined that. Their final thought was on the lines of, ""It's disappointing for sure, but I will get over it"".

The only remaining @ credit that was on their social for all the work I'd done was immediately removed, not even an hour after I quit. So now, any further posts that I've edited, I am going to assume I will not be credited.. all in all, I'm very confused, worried my editing won't be asked by this person anymore and feel slightly used.

Now I was at a big convention. I struggle with social anxiety and crowds, so the time there was very stressful, but overall super nice. I also met with other friends that I rarely get to see, and bought small gifts for my friend at home.

At the con there was niche merch of my friend's favourite game. Nothing official, but licensed. It had very different aesthetics from the original or what I thought my friend would like. It was very pricey and I didn't even realize there was anything there from their fave character. One of my friends I was there with convinced me to participate in a raffle at that stand and we even ended up winning sth. I mostly just liked the aesthetic of the merch and had the chance to pick my favourite piece, so I was happy and moved on without thinking about it too much anymore.

6,1fokm8u,AITA for refusing to move across the country after my husband's aunt died?,"My \[36F\] husband's \[37F\] very close aunt \[51F\] recently died after a year-long battle with a horrible disease. His parents \[76M & 72F\] are devastated — the aunt was my MIL's much younger sister, who was more like a daughter to both her and my FIL.

My husband didn't necessarily see her as a sister—he has an older sister \[40F\] who he is much closer to than he was his aunt, who had a lot of problems with alcoholism and emotional instability—but he acknowledges that his parents feel that way and feels IMMENSE guilt for not being in closer contact with her over the past few years. He has some resentment of me as well, since his aunt and I never got along (for lack of character count: she was not nice to me and he acknowledged this previously.) He has implied some blame on my part for the wedge between them.

In the wake of this devastating loss, is parents and sister want us to move back to their area, which is directly across the country from where we live. My husband is also wracked with guilt for not having been there during his aunt's final months (other than a few visits on weekends), so he is inclined to do what his family asks.

I am opposed to this move for a few reasons:

1. My husband's job is here. He is in a specialized field and it wouldn't be easy to find a new job, especially in a different state. Meanwhile, I am a stay-at-home mom of our daughter (7F). If my husband quits his job, we'll have zero income. We have robust savings that could get us through \~6 months, but using them to upend our life seems potentially irresponsible.
2. Part of why I'm still a SAHM is because our daughter has social-emotional struggles. She's suspected ADHD, with a diagnosed panic disorder. She has finally settled into a nice routine at school and at home. I'm very concerned that a sudden major move, ripping her away from her known routine, friends, and safe places will set us back months in her progress.
3. His family is obviously devastated, but they don't have an acute ""need"" for help that we could provide. They want the comfort of their son nearby, which I sympathize with, but I don't think it's a good enough reason to, again, upend our life.
4. I've always heard you shouldn't make big changes during the first year of grief.

My rejection of this idea has really upset my husband, and he's barely speaking to me right now. He's been withdrawn and cold.

And at the same time, my SIL sent me a harsh text message, ripping me apart for being so selfish in the face of their overwhelming grief. She says my parents have gotten enough time with us (they live in the same city we do now), and it's my husband's side of the family's ""turn."" But my reasons for not wanting to move across the country have nothing to do with my extended family; it's for my nuclear family's stability.

My husband didn't necessarily see her as a sister—he has an older sister \[40F\] who he is much closer to than he was his aunt, who had a lot of problems with alcoholism and emotional instability—but he acknowledges that his parents feel that way and feels IMMENSE guilt for not being in closer contact with her over the past few years. He has some resentment of me as well, since his aunt and I never got along (for lack of character count: she was not nice to me and he acknowledged this previously.) He has implied some blame on my part for the wedge between them.

In the wake of this devastating loss, is parents and sister want us to move back to their area, which is directly across the country from where we live. My husband is also wracked with guilt for not having been there during his aunt's final months (other than a few visits on weekends), so he is inclined to do what his family asks.

I am opposed to this move for a few reasons:

1. My husband's job is here. He is in a specialized field and it wouldn't be easy to find a new job, especially in a different state. Meanwhile, I am a stay-at-home mom of our daughter (7F). If my husband quits his job, we'll have zero income. We have robust savings that could get us through \~6 months, but using them to upend our life seems potentially irresponsible.
2. Part of why I'm still a SAHM is because our daughter has social-emotional struggles. She's suspected ADHD, with a diagnosed panic disorder. She has finally settled into a nice routine at school and at home. I'm very concerned that a sudden major move, ripping her away from her known routine, friends, and safe places will set us back months in her progress.
3. His family is obviously devastated, but they don't have an acute ""need"" for help that we could provide. They want the comfort of their son nearby, which I sympathize with, but I don't think it's a good enough reason to, again, upend our life.
4. I've always heard you shouldn't make big changes during the first year of grief.

My rejection of this idea has really upset my husband, and he's barely speaking to me right now. He's been withdrawn and cold.

And at the same time, my SIL sent me a harsh text message, ripping me apart for being so selfish in the face of their overwhelming grief. She says my parents have gotten enough time with us (they live in the same city we do now), and it's my husband's side of the family's ""turn."" But my reasons for not wanting to move across the country have nothing to do with my extended family; it's for my nuclear family's stability.

8,1fokf27,AITA For telling my wife to take time off work if she wants time for herself,"My wife (40F) and I (39M) have been married for 12 years and have 2 kids (9 & 7).  We both work full time, but I have got promoted about 3 months ago that required a change to my work hours.  I used to have the same standard M-F hours as my wife.  But my new role has me working 10-hour shifts Thursday-Sunday.  This promotion came with a pretty substantial pay raise as well.  My wife and I discussed how my change in hours would affect our family's day-to-day lives, but we both agreed it would be worth it for the additional income.  

I use my time off on Monday-Wednesday to do pretty much all the family shopping, errands, cleaning, laundry, and have even been able to make substantial progress on some long put-off home projects.  I also cook dinners and prep weekly lunches for the kids and my wife.  The additional income is becoming noticeable as well as we haven't had this much in our savings account in years.  

A few weeks ago, my wife started griping about my new job.  She hates that I am working all weekend because that means she's with the kids the whole time.  She complains that she goes from working all week to solo-parenting on weekends.  Both our kids are in activities on weekends so she has been doing that by herself as well.  

We talked about ways to ease some of the weekend stuff from her such as getting a babysitter, carpooling to kids' activities, taking the kids to their grandparents, etc.  But she still complains that all of the leg work for those things will be done by her because I'm at work.  She said she feels like she never has any time for herself since my hours got changed.  

To try and alleviate this, I suggested that she make plans with friends to do something on Monday or Tuesday nights.  She tried but got frustrated when her friends were busy those nights and wanted to get together on weekends.  This led to another argument with her telling me that she hates my new job and that I need to look into changing my hours again.

I told her that I have been trying everything to help ease the transition with my new job but all I've been met with is hostility and frustration.  I asked her if there was anything more I could do other than change my hours and she told me, ""No.""  She said she just hates that she doesn't get a break and that I have 3 days to myself.  

I started listing off all the ways I have been trying to make this easier and how much more money we are making and she cut me off and said the money isn't worth it.  I got frustrated and told her if she needs time for herself, she should just use vacation time from work if she's not going to be reasonable and help me find a compromise.

10,1fok0ir,WIBTA? Wanting to tell my dad about my sis spending money?,"
My sister (F39) has asked me (F37) multiple times to come help her clean her two bedroom apt. I’ve done it often and I’ve been fed up with it cause the agreement is that she would help me after but always finds an excuse of why she can’t. So now I refuse to help her clean her place.

Today, she called me to tell me that she’s paying someone to clean her place but told them that it’s my place. Then she called me saying that she’ll be « getting in touch » with me through out the day asking questions if we keep or throw out. And then the person walked in and then she started saying things like: this is disgusting, I never want to see your place like that anymore, etc. And she called again and said that she’s paying the person 1000$ for a two day job…but she complains she doesn’t have money. And then started to say more things like: I’m never paying someone to for that ever again, you have to keep the place clean, etc.

Like the hell? She’s nuts! Not wanting to take the blame…nothing new but still. I have helped her multiple times at her place (2 bedroom apartment) and she helped me once (i have a 3 bedroom townhouse with a basement). I find it ridiculous she can’t even admit to the person that it’s her place. About 2 weeks ago, she asked me when we would be cleaning, I never responded. Cause I’m fed up with it always being about her. 

I talked to my dad yesterday about her asking about me helping clean and he told me that next time she brings it up, to tell her that she needs to help me with my place first and then I could maybe help her. Reason why I say maybe, it’s cause every time I go to her place, it’s like a pig pen. It’s really disgusting. She has 50/50 custody of her daughter so it’s not like she doesn’t have time. I know my sister and she gives excuses like my 17 year old son does when he doesn’t want to do something or take the blame for something. 

A bit of back story, she has always been a drama queen in our family. She would always make it about her and her daughter, she would play the victim and such, not wanting to take the blame.

11,1fojh2x,AITA for telling my dad he made a dumb decision and I don't need to fix it for him?,"My mom died when I (16M) was 5. I remember her, just not amazingly well. When I was 7 my dad started dating again and met Mara. At first I was upset about Mara and my dad dating and didn't want to meet her and gave her a hard time. I told her I didn't want her replacing my mom. She gave me space to let out all my feelings at her and then she reassured me she was not here to take mom's place. She told me she really liked my dad and wanted to really like me too but she didn't have to be my mom for us to like each other. At first I wasn't sure if I believed her. But she won me over and we got along really well. She even lived with us for a year. But when I was 10 dad broke up with Mara and said she wasn't trying hard enough to fill the role of mom for me and I needed a mom. I told him I didn't want another mom and I loved Mara. That she was the best. Mara was blindsided by it because things had been so good and I don't think my dad had said it would be a dealbreaker.

Within a few months he met his wife, Stacey. Stacey was a single mom with a 2 year old daughter. I was 11 by then. Stacey was very on board to be my new mom and I was not. I said it so many times I didn't want a new mom, I wouldn't call someone else mom, I missed Mara and wouldn't give Stacey a chance if she tried to take over mom's place. I was ignored and dad and Stacey got married when I was 12.

She has tried to make me love her and her daughter. But I'm not here to get a new mom. I'm not open to it, something dad now knows.

I asked a guy I kind of only know via J, K (25m) if he wanted to join us and his girlfriend answered for him saying ""no, he's not going on a hike with a bunch of girls swimming."" I was a bit taken aback and mentioned there were only two girls going and she very adamantly said ""he doesn't hang out with girls without me.""

I let it go mostly and continued on with the meal but when we were all settling the bill at the cash out and she was still at the table I mentioned to him that I thought it was odd she answered for him. He shrugged and said he doesn't hang out with girls without her and she doesn't hang out with guys without him. I said she seemed a bit controlling and it was odd that was their relationship dynamic, mentioning how my husband didn't care that I was going swimming with 4 guys because he trusts me. 

Later on the hike J was on his phone and he told me he was talking to K and that now K and gf won't hang out with me and husband anymore after I called her controlling. I was a little upset and he told me that K's gf didn't like his wife for a long time too so not to worry about it.

I was going on a nice hike to a swimming hole with my best friend (30M) after lunch and invited people at the lunch to go with us. Among the people who agreed to go were J (35m) and his wife (36f) and 2 other male friends. My husband opted out of going.

I asked a guy I kind of only know via J, K (25m) if he wanted to join us and his girlfriend answered for him saying ""no, he's not going on a hike with a bunch of girls swimming."" I was a bit taken aback and mentioned there were only two girls going and she very adamantly said ""he doesn't hang out with girls without me.""

I let it go mostly and continued on with the meal but when we were all settling the bill at the cash out and she was still at the table I mentioned to him that I thought it was odd she answered for him. He shrugged and said he doesn't hang out with girls without her and she doesn't hang out with guys without him. I said she seemed a bit controlling and it was odd that was their relationship dynamic, mentioning how my husband didn't care that I was going swimming with 4 guys because he trusts me. 

Later on the hike J was on his phone and he told me he was talking to K and that now K and gf won't hang out with me and husband anymore after I called her controlling. I was a little upset and he told me that K's gf didn't like his wife for a long time too so not to worry about it. But he said it was kind of a ""dick move"" to call her controlling and question how their relationship works.

14,1foib62,AITA for sending most of my extended family an email stating why they are never invited to things anymore?,"I (36f) made the (not so) difficult decision to no longer invite my extended family to dinner, parties, school events for my kids, etc. The one exception is my nephew Jamie (18). He is my elder sister's eldest. He moved in with my husband and myself for a while before he turned 18 to get away from his parents and younger brother (17).

Some context/bg. When Jamie was born his parents genuinely seemed to love him. And they appeared, to a younger me, to be good parents. That changed as soon as his younger brother was born. Suddenly my sister and BIL talked about Jamie as a nightmare, said he was an awful baby, they hated every moment with him and his younger brother was an angel and perfect. This attitude continued. Jamie wasn't a misbehaving kid or ""feral"" like he was described, but he ran around, got dirty, made noise and messes like most little kids. But this was treated like something awful. His younger brother was quiet, neat, etc, etc. They would always compare Jamie to his brother to shame him into being different. If he spilled something they'd scold him. If he got messy they'd reprimand him harshly for it. The rest of my extended family started acting the same. Jamie couldn't do anything right. He sneezed, it was too loud. He fell, he was being reckless/careless. And the praise for his bother was insane. Like yeah, he was a quieter and calmer kid but Jamie wasn't destroying things or stealing, yelling, cursing, etc. Even having too much fun got Jamie negative attention and I was told to shut up whenever I'd defend him or tell people to lay off.

I took it upon myself to be there for Jamie as much as I could. The older the boys got the harder it got because Jamie also had his brother trying to get him into trouble or berating him for things. I hated seeing it but I knew I needed to be there for Jamie and avoiding it would do no good. Nobody showed up for Jamie except for me. I was often the only family member (except for when I married and had kids) who made an appearance at school plays and the likes.

When Jamie moved in with us, and got his freedom, I decided it was time to do the same. My family kept asking me about coming over and when were my kids things. Nobody asked about Jamie. Or they'd want to know about parties for the kids. I let it all pile up and then I decided to send an email to the extended family outlining how disgusting their behavior toward Jamie had been and how that meant they would no longer receive any invitations from me. I got a lot of negativity back with people saying I shouldn't take *HIS* side when he's a bratty little shit who deserved everything he got. I don't regret defending Jamie BUT did I handled this badly?

15,1foi6zf,"AITA for ""confronting"" my brother's crap?","Today, I was laying on the couch in our fairly large living room, while reading a book. My brother came from his room with a pen and a notebook, sat down at the opposite side of the living room, set down his stuff, then asked me to leave.

 I said, ""Why? You barely see me and I'm not making a sound. This is the living room."", he did not respond. A few moments later, he said ""So, why haven't you left yet? Are you trying to be annoying or something? Just want to understand your thought process here."". 

At that point, I was annoyed, so I decided to come up with a reply of similar structure, to make it clear that I think he's being a jerk.

So I replied, ""So, why do you randomly decide that a third of the apartment has to be emptied of my presence, with what little effect it has on you? Are you trying to be annoying or something? Just want to understand your thought process here."". He then said, ""Just go to one of the other two thirds of the apartment, is it that hard?"". So, I ignored him. He got up a minute or two later and said ""Hope you're happy."" and left the room. 

Now I would like to clear up that my brother and I are not exactly ""good friends"", but we're not enemies either. He often asks me to leave him alone, say if I were in his room, or if he was studying, and I do grant these requests. However, I felt that this time it's not really justified. I literally had to peek out of the couch I was laying on to see him, and made absolutely no noise whatsoever.

16,1fohx7k,AITA For staying friends with my friend’s ex gf?,"

I’ve known this friend for nearly seven years. He met his girlfriend a year later, and they dated for almost six years. Towards the end of their relationship, she felt closer to me and another mutual friend than to him. This made him uncomfortable, as she talked to us more than him. I tried to set boundaries but still wanted to support her without dropping her as a friend.
She was going through a stressful situation with him and was ready to break up before we got close. 

I encouraged her to talk to him about their issues, hoping to repair their relationship, but it didn’t work out. He now blames me and the other mutual friend for their breakup, without taking responsibility himself. She relied on him for everything, but neither of them was emotionally happy.

After she moved back home, I continued talking to her daily, taking breaks due to stress but trying to be there for her. I visited her a few times, but the friend made it clear he wanted no contact between us and her. I didn’t feel that was right and maintained boundaries, keeping our relationship platonic.

The other friend started hanging out with her more, visiting her every weekend, and she stayed at his place. She has always been affectionate, but their relationship seemed more than just friends. I felt lonely and jealous of the time she spent with him, so I visited her. She told me she didn’t see him romantically but admitted they had messed around. I talked to her about why I felt it was wrong and that that’s what he wanted all along and wasn’t a true friend.

After our talk, we watched a movie and cuddled, which felt okay because I enjoyed being with her. I had always seen her as a friend, but now I feel more jealous. Our friend group fell apart after the breakup, and I barely talk to either of them. I feel conflicted, as all my stress and sleepless nights seem wasted with her ending up with another friend, even though I never wanted to get with her. 

Now, I’m not sure what to do. I feel angry, jealous, depressed, and lonely knowing he gets to not set boundaries and do stuff with her and be rewarded for it. I talk with her every day but I’m not sure how much longer I can sit on the sidelines feeling this way. I’m jealous of when they’re together and always wonder what they’re doing together.

17,1foht5i,AITA for being patronizing to my friend?,"I (16F) was with a group of my friends after school, getting together to take the subway. One friend, Z, had sprained her ankle earlier in the day. She could walk, but she was limping. We were waiting for one of our friends to get some ice for her, and my friend (17M), K, decided to carry her bag. Z whispered to me: ""I really hate when people take care of me, I don't want anyone carrying my bag."" I respected her wishes and asked K to let me hold the bag, planning to give it back to Z. He refused, saying: ""I know you're gonna give it back to her."" I told him no, but he insisted, saying it hurt his conscience. I said: ""Your conscience doesn't matter as much as her feelings."" After repeatedly telling him, he gave the bag back but then started screaming at me, clapping in my face, and backing me up. I was visibly upset. My friend, M, and I left to head for the station, and everyone else followed, except K, who had fencing practice.

K sent me an apology, but it felt more like a defense. He focused on how hurting me hurt him, and how he felt patronized. I know he wouldn’t have apologized if I hadn’t reacted that way. He also spoke to M and F before asking me how I was. M told him the apology was defensive, but K didn’t see the problem. He only wanted to know what he did to make me cry. I’ve told him before about my trauma from men yelling at me. He also hates being patronized. This situation had been simmering, as he used to have feelings for me, and I noticed a decline in our relationship after that. Everything combined with the fear I felt made me cry.

Later, after M and F acted as go-betweens, K asked to talk. I was ready to explain, so I told him the clapping and screaming made me cry. I also mentioned I was emotional to take some blame off him, as I often feel like I have to shift blame or compliment him to avoid upsetting him. He then said, ""Okay fine, u pissed me tf so I reacted to u like how I felt u were treating me, tbh I don't even think I'm wrong here but I see that you've cried so I HAVE to be in the wrong so basically I just have to be 'I'm so sorry, I was wrong u were right and I hope u forgive' and lwk that annoys me.""

I told him there was nothing else I could’ve done without breaking Z’s trust, and that his ego being hurt wasn’t comparable to him screaming at me. He said I was agitating him, so I let it go. At 1 am, he messaged me saying he intended to return the bag and realized he brought up my trauma. We briefly discussed our deteriorating friendship. I told him I wanted to move past it, but he ignored that message. He said he was done explaining himself. I told him I had moved past it, and he said he’d leave it there, but I know he’s still angry.

Yes, perhaps I'm too passive by not saying anything but I don't want to incur my sister's defensiveness or just make him feel shitty so I choose to suffer through, but since I'm respectful when he hosts and he doesn't return the favor when I host, I just find myself hostile and I check out a lot when he engages in this stuff.

The trip was paid for fully by my parents(55m+55f) because they spent about the same money on clubs parties and extracurriculars for my sisters that i never did. The company gave me a voucher to use on another trip or i could refund it and keep the money(about 4,600 USD). My parents also let me live rent free at home though i have offered to pay them rent and they refused everytime.

 At my parents insistence i decided to finally use the voucher to pay for a trip this January but instead of going to greece i decided to buy a different trip to several eastern european countries partially because i would get to see more countries overall and partially because it was cheaper and i would be able to use the extra money for buying travel insurance and bonus activities. Even after buying all of those i had 240 USD left over and i decided to have it refunded back to me. This is where the problems started.

Before my parents insited i go on the trip but they said even if i decided to refund the money i could keep the refunded money because they gave it to me and during my trip i had multiple of my extra events refunded because they were canceled due to the rain and flooding that has been happening as of late. In total im supposed to get 80 usd refunded back to me from that and my parents said i could keep it since i was cheated out of those events. The 240 usd was also originally gonna go to me so i could have extra spending money in europe but the refund wouldnt be processed until i was in the middle of my trip and so i couldnt get it cashed until i got back.

Now i am back from my trip and my mom had me go to the bank with her so i could cash the check and put the 240 in my parents account and i did but when we got back i was upset because in the past they were gonna let me keep any refunded money but they changed their mind for the 240 usd.

Now i am back from my trip and my mom had me go to the bank with her so i could cash the check and put the 240 in my parents account and i did but when we got back i was upset because in the past they were gonna let me keep any refunded money but they changed their mind for the 240 usd. My mom got mad that i was upset and said that i was spoiled and selfish. And i know im privileged in many ways and they already give so much to me but its less about the money to me and more about how they went back on their promise. AITA?",2.0,1.057287335395813,1,0
21,1fogxcc,AITA for asking my dad not to bring his girlfriend to a football game?,"I (25F) am an only child. My parents divorced four years ago, and I’ve always had a good relationship with my dad (59M), though sometimes rocky. We’ve had a tradition of going out to dinner every Friday, and I’ve always tried to maintain a close bond with him.

In 2021, I befriended June (45F), a colleague of mine. We weren’t super close, but I considered her more than just a work friend. We’d hung out, and at one point, I even asked her to lend me her credit card to buy us Lollapalooza tickets. In return, she asked to visit my family’s island house, which I agreed to. I didn’t think much of it when I later invited her and her daughter to the house, with my dad driving us there.

Turns out, my dad and June started dating shortly after. They did ask for my permission at first, and I reluctantly said yes. But over time, I began to feel sidelined. June started coming to all our outings, even to the point where my dad wanted to include her and her kids on our annual New Year’s trip. Whenever I wanted to hang out with my dad alone, he’d suggest I “tag along” with them instead. By October, I had enough and told him how uncomfortable I felt. His response was that they were a couple now, and I needed to accept that they would always do things together. I wasn’t asking him to choose between us, just to have some time with him alone.

Fast forward to last Wednesday, my dad called asking if he could bring June to our local football club game, something that’s been a special tradition for us since I was a kid. I said no, reminding him that this was supposed to be “our thing.” He pushed back, saying he didn’t want her to be alone on a Saturday night. I told him again that my answer was no. He called me spoiled and bratty and said he was bringing her anyway. I stood my ground, saying he could go with her but not pick me up. He then suggested we could all have dinner afterward, to which I said I’d rather go with one of my friends. He proposed we all go together, and I said no again. Finally, he said, “Okay, I’m bringing her either way.”

Five minutes later, he called back saying, “You know what, I’m not going.” Since then, we haven’t spoken. I tried calling on Friday to cancel our usual dinner plans, but he didn’t respond.

He’s currently living with June while she builds her new house (with his help), so they see each other every day.

Now Stew and Molly, called me the other night to ask me if i can help them pack, i had been pretty open with how busy i’ve been with homework over the past couple weeks, so i was going to go on the tuesday with my dad, as i am broke also. this plan fell through, so i call Stew and tell him i will come up Wednesday to Thursday, which worked out well. now to this morning (tuesday). i have been having sleeping issues for the past couple years, my sister (37F) who lives at home with us (because she’s a slob) comes in at 8am to wake me up to tell me that Stew is calling me, i tell her, ive only just gotten to sleep at 7am and i will call back when i get up later, i drift back off to sleep, she then comes back to tell me AGAIN to answer the phone to which i tell her, i need to sleep so i can do homework when i wake up, she then leaves and comes back one more time to yell at me for not answering and i should call him now, i tell her i can’t because I AM TRYING TO SLEEP, after all of that, i finally drift off 2 hours later n wake up for the day at 2pm. i get up and go to my desk and start my homework, i give Stew a call and he doesn’t answer, i send a message stating that what happened and that i would still be coming up tommorow. to that i got a response to no longer come up and help as Molly has now taken time off work, i rebut this and ask if i can still come up and help

So Stew calls me at this point it’s 7pm, in this call he tells me that i should have gotten up and helped, that we are all tired and it is a part of life, that if i can’t sleep at night i should do my homework then and it’s my terrible time management that is the issue, that i should rearrange my schedule to come down and help, i try to explain why i can’t and how the assignments are huge, and if i don’t complete them i will fail the course, and he then says “we all have little things in our lives but we should move them around for family”, that nobody ever helps him when he needs it and that im not doing enough homework which i usually spend 7-8 hours a day doing homework, i am just really angry about this whole situation and i’m not sure whether to confort him about it, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-24,"AITA for not helping my brother For a bit of context i come from a fairly big family, as in alot of siblings, im the 9th and youngest (20F).

23,1fogl4f,AITA for getting angry after a spider crawled over my knuckles? ,"My boyfriend and I have a foster dog that is high-energy and doesn't do well on a lead. I've been giving her daily walks and training each day to get her ready for adoption. My boyfriend will often volunteer to take her out, but because of her reactivity to leash-pulling, he'll return completely pissed off at the dog.  His bad mood tends to linger and if I don't tread lightly, it will get taken out on me. I usually walk her alone to avoid this.

Yesterday, he offered to walk the dog. My response was, ""Are you sure? I don't want you get overwhelmed."" To me it was an innocuous question and I didn't consider that it would offend him. But it did, and he immediately started in on me.

He began mocking and talking over me. He said, ""You think you can predict everything with your fucking expertise but you're actually so stupid. You just think I'm a monster don't you? That I can't even walk the dog without getting mad and scaring you, wah! You poor thing. You don't even care about my feelings, you just care about protecting your own.""

I tried to explain myself but it began to escalate. I left the house alone, drove around and cried. When I returned he was sleeping on the couch, which he usually does after an outburst. I usually never wake him in this state.

Quick aside- I'm VERY afraid of insects but especially spiders. I wish I wasn't because they are truly everywhere in the region where I live, but it's been a lifelong, debilitating fear for me that as an adult I've been working to desensitize myself to.

After I got home I was in the kitchen when I noticed a leak under the sink had soaked the cabinet, the floor and was running into the next room. I hesitated to wake my boyfriend up but I did anyway because I didn't know what to do.

I woke him and he went in to check it out. He was still mad from earlier but he was only being distant. He said we would have to remove a piece of the wall. I was under the cabinet trying to listen for the water. One of my arms was in the puddle while the other rested on the inside wall. I glanced back while talking and noticed that he wasn't looking at my eyes, but at my hand. I followed his eyes to see that there was a HUGE spider crawling across my knuckles. The poor thing was probably just trying to escape the water and not trying to bite me, but it still scared the absolute shit out of me.

I screamed and waved it off, then I turned and screamed at him for not warning me. He responded, ""You should have known there could be spiders under there. Aren't you trying to become less afraid of them anyway? I figured you knew it was there."" I saw red in this moment.

Nothing bad happened, but I don't understand why he would allow something to touch me that knowing that it will make me afraid. Why not tell me to move my hand to protect my feelings, if not my actual body from getting bitten? I’m hurt because I felt like he got some weird satisfaction from it because he was angry,  He said I'm horrible for making that accusation. AITA?

  After divorcing my mother 10 years ago, while my siblings and I were teenagers, he moved out of the house to live a bachelors life and travel/party. He left my mother because he was not happy coming home to her for years and never told her he was unhappy. My younger sibling and I were left at home with our mother as he pretty much became hands off, causing a lot of resentment from her as well as my older sibling. 

   He met his new girlfriend about 3-4 years after the split when she caught him walking out of a bar and asked him for directions. She is a divorced single mother, with children slightly younger than my siblings and I, who divorced her husband because he was apparently “low effort” and “lazy”(my father informs me). He likes her because he can go to dinners and to parties and travel with her, and that she makes good money(which my mother didn’t because she was full time stay at home). For years he was saying he would never get married again up until about 2 years ago. He has broken up with this woman on several occasions but they’ve gotten back together each time. The last time they broke up was last summer when she was pestering him about marriage and he didn’t want to. They fought about it until he finally agreed and then he proposed to her last fall during a trip to Italy. I genuinely don’t feel love or any meaningful connection from these two as all they do together is have superficial conversations and drink together. My father has planned a big wedding spectacle with anyone he knows attending and all her friends (he boasts how she has a lot of friends). 
   
   The whole situation has just perturbed me and the longer I’ve gotten to know this woman the less I like about her. My father knows all of this and my reasonings but says he can “do whatever he wants” and “no one can tell him what to do”. I just don’t think these two make each other happy and they both pursue pleasure to fill this sadness, now they just do it together.

No more laughing & joking around, and all the sudden her texting became formal - almost as if I was texting a coworker. I want to make it clear to readers that my habits and actions towards her did not change at all once I started talking to my boyfriend and I barely talk about him to her, it’s not like I started talking to him and started ignoring her. When it came time for my first date with my boyfriend, I received no text or anything from Kimmy which kind of upset me  as I thought she’d be happy/excited for me. From then on whenever Kimmy and I hung out she seemed pretty disinterested in anything I had to say including anything about my boyfriend so I stopped brining him up around her. Eventually she said “I never tell her about him” and I told her it’s because she doesn’t seem to care. I continually tried asking her what’s going on and why she started acting so cold/weird to me and she basically said she’s not acting any type of way and that “people change” or “friends grow apart” which confused me because I didn’t think anything changed except for how she was acting. For about 3 months I would cry to her weekly asking her what I did and how we can get back to how we were before. This would result in her feeling bad, acting “normal” for a few days, then ultimately returning back to her apathetic state.

She ignored my text and I have not head from her since. She ended our 600 day Snapchat streak and I’ve seen her around and she gave me a tight lipped smile and cordial wave. 

I endured her behavior for 3 months and never gave up on our friendship but I decided to do what’s best for myself and not go to the festival and she decides the friendship is over due to a rift that she caused. It doesn’t seem fair to me but am I the asshole?",0.0,0.0499909035861492,0,1
27,1fofu7n,"AITA for taking my neighbours cat to the vet, thinking she was an abuse case, when in fact she is just ""old""?","Im having a big wave of guilt about this, im autistic and feel emotions very strongly and worry ive made a huge mistake. 

So story is, this morning a cat that looked like a ruffled skeleton appeared in my garden. Gooey eyes, missing fur, bones sticking out everywhere. Horrific. I went outside to greet her and she was friendly and nice enough, walked right up, wanted in the house etc. When i bent down to pet her, she was skin and bone and her fur was full of mats and tangles and etc. She looked very poorly, so my mum and i decided to take her to the vet to see if she was lost or a stray. 

An hour after we came home, an angry facebook post appeared on our local towns group saying that the cat is just old, has hyperthyroidism , is under ver supervision and is very well cared for. The owner was annoyed that she got taken to the vet and seemed incredibly upset that the cat was being fed and cared for outside of their home.

Should a cat in her condition, skin and bone, matted and missing fur etc be kept indoors? Like obviously people are going to think something is wrong when a cat looking like that just appears in their home. She looks like she has been either abused or is lost, but the owners insist she is loved. 

The owner themselves is upset and is stating that the cat is quite distressed from going to the vet. I feel like i caused a big problem over nothing and theyre going to be really angry at me if they find out i essentially kidnapped their cat temporarily.

The issue I don't know how to prepare for a large family so I'll either make too little or too much and they won't eat leftovers or I make something they never had /tried and only us 3 adults eat it so I'm stuck eating it for like 3 days. 

Last night I made spaghetti and meatballs. I didn't make enough pasta so instead of making more noodles they just left the food out uncovered and made cup of noodles (ramen) wasting the meatballs which I could have eaten off for atleat 2 days.

I didn’t really think I was in the wrong because I’ve had to tell him so,
so many times prior to talk louder, and i did not mean to come off as aggressive as I did. he is mad at me for not really seeing a problem in me snapping, when I did not really believe i truly snapped at him nor did it in a way that was unprompted. I have apologized for coming off aggressive as I did not intend it, but I’ve emphasized so many times how much it bothered me that he mumbles given that i am practically deaf. 

so am i the asshole for chewing him out? if so, how can i apologize or make it right? i’d still like to use this as a reason to be a better partner to him. 


UPDATE 1: thanks for the feedback. did not like hearing it but i DO appreciate it. i should have specified that i have set an appointment to get it checked out: i have been meaning to earlier but my parents are going through a wacky divorce and my dad kicked me and my siblings off our medical insurance and my mom had to figure out a way to get me on her company’s insurance otherwise i would not get student loans from my college. overall stressful situation on her end and i did not want to burden her w my health problem, so i dismissed i, especially when it comes to money. 

my boyfriend is still in class and I have a therapy appointment at 5, HOWEVER- i absolutely do intend on apologizing and admitting i was in the wrong for snapping and i hope to communicate a solution with him. again, thank you all for the feedback and i’ll update you on how that goes.

Over the years though, I've seen her buy cars, redo her whole house and I never really questioned it because I wanted her to be happy now that she had the funds to do what she wanted.

Once we visited a few places, she became more and more disinterested and finally said ""I need an updated 2 bedroom 2 bath apartment, en-suite laundry, with updated appliances, all these apartments are for poor people"".

That morning I woke up to her kissing my face and licking it knowing full well that I'm extremely uncomfortable with anything with people other than a significant other kissing my face after I've told her many times. That day I had tried to be away from her explaining that she had made me uncomfortable. She started saying how I was being selfish and a jerk and she was in the wrong. I've been thinking about this for the past few days and I'm starting to think I was being an asshole she doesn't see me much as I live in Japan and she lives in the States so I should just let her do whatever her shitty antics are in the moment.

My best friend (also 22F) and I have basically grown up together, so you’d think we’d have each other’s backs no matter what. We met in kindergarten in polish school and have been inseparable ever since, and because of this our families have also gotten really close. But when I started dating my ex (24M), I introduced them, and they started getting weirdly close throughout our relationship. I even mentioned to both of them multiple times that it made me uncomfortable, but they brushed it off, saying they were just friends.

Things really came to a head when he started telling her personal things about us *before* telling me. When I confronted them about it, they both insisted that they have a “sibling relationship” and made me feel like I was being dramatic for suggesting otherwise. I broke up with him a few months ago, and I expected her to maybe distance herself from him at least a little bit. But nope—if anything, they talk even more now, almost every day.

I've been slowly pulling away from her because honestly, it just feels like a huge betrayal, but now our mutual friends are saying that I’m blowing things out of proportion. They keep telling me I shouldn’t let a guy get between us, especially since I was the one who broke up with him. But am I really overreacting here? I just feel like a real friend would take my feelings into consideration, right?

I don’t know what to do anymore. Should I talk to her again? Or am I justified in creating some distance?

I'm 17(ftm) and live in my parents house, we have a decently sized home but my personal room is really large. Full bedroom, bathroom, kitchenette, and a living room area. I love it! I am so greatful to have such a large room.

Since my family have moved into this house my parents will occasionally allow struggling family or friends to stay over in the living room area and use the downstairs amenities. We recently had to have my downstairs room fully redone due to my cousin's living down their for about 3 years. Pee soaked carpet, holes in walls, laminate flooring torn up, gum on the walls. My parents paid thousands to have my downstairs area fixed up urgently, mostly because we rent and don't own the house, but because I desperately wanted my downstairs room back. 

Because of the money spent on redoing the whole downstairs area my parents are very stern on keeping downstairs clean understandably. But now one of my cousins is back due to being kicked out for not getting a job or going to school and running away to new york?! Because my cousin (20 m) is older than me, I don't like being downstairs in my room while he's awake and doing things, it feels invasive, so I now spend most of my time upstairs in our spare office room with my boyfriend. I do my school work, sewing, play pc games all within this office. Hell I'll even get a pillow and blanket and we'll sleep on the bare floor just because!

Here's where I might be the asshole.

I dont go downstairs for much of anything anymore. Besides sleeping, brushing my teeth, and showering I'm never downstairs. l spend all of my time in the office, yet somehow, I'm being blamed for the cleanliness of the downstairs room. Dishes in the sink, Dried toothpaste all over the bathoom, Not cleaning my dad's PS5 table set up, Floor unvacuumed?

All my cousin does is dwell in my basement room. Nothing else. I have tried to stress that as the adult man living in MY ROOM he could pick up the slack and maybe wash his dishes, vacuum, clean up after himself but I'm the one being constantly yelled at. And the best part is I'm paying for almost ALL cleaning supplies. Soaps, toilet paper, cleaning chemicals, it all comes from my pocket or my partners.

I want to just take all my belongings from downstairs. All of it. I cannot take being yelled at for the cleanliness of an area I don't even stay in anymore!

I tell her that it's her body and she can do whatever she likes, but I think that I prefer the amount of tattoos she has currently and that I don't think I would like the tattoo.

41,1focq9j,AITA for telling my mother she can't bring my Dad when she visits? ,"My father is a narcissist and for 20 years we haven't had a relationship.  I moved out at 17 and to another state at 19 and would come back 6-10x a year to visit my mother and other family members. 

3 years ago my first child was born and I haven't been able to travel much since.  I have only been back to my home state 2x.  Part of this is that it's hard to travel with a toddler and the other part is that I don't want my son around my father. 


My mom visits my family about 2x/yr for short visits of a few days.   We invite her constantly and have even offered to pay her flights.  She always asks about bringing my Dad and I always tell her that I don't want him to come.

After her asking many times to bring my dad and her only visiting once this year for less than a week I finally agreed that my Dad could come with her for a visit.   It just felt like if I didn't agree that she wouldn't come and I want my son to know her.  I find my dad to be insufferable and the 1 week visit was truly exhausting.  My father is a very combative and aggressive person and I don't like my son seeing how my father treats me and others and I really don't like my son seeing how frustrated and upset he makes me.  

Yesterday was the last full day of my parents visit and I had a private chat with my mom that I really want her to be a bigger part of my sons life. I hate that in 3 years she has only seen him a handful of times.  She said that my Dad doesn't like her coming without him because he wants to go and that he blames her and is mad at her for visiting me without him.  I told her that he isn't going to be invited back so if she wants to see us she will have to be willing to come without him and that she should just blame me when he gets upset.   She kind of ignored everything I said and responded with ""he's 78 and not going to change now""

The conversation was left without resolution and I just have the feeling that nothing will change and I will see her less and less. I can tell that she thinks it's unfair that my dad won't be invited back. 

I absolutely adore my mother and I want my son to get to know her. In some ways I feel like a jerk that my decisions about not wanting my father around are keeping my mother from having a relationship with my son.  But I also feel betrayed by her in a way that she isnt very willing to come on her own.  Am I being unreasonable?

She kind of ignored everything I said and responded with ""he's 78 and not going to change now""

The conversation was left without resolution and I just have the feeling that nothing will change and I will see her less and less. I can tell that she thinks it's unfair that my dad won't be invited back. 

I absolutely adore my mother and I want my son to get to know her. In some ways I feel like a jerk that my decisions about not wanting my father around are keeping my mother from having a relationship with my son.  But I also feel betrayed by her in a way that she isnt very willing to come on her own.  Am I being unreasonable? ",0.0,0.005617749877274,0,1
42,1focejw,AITA for Not Spending as Much Time with My Best Friend Because I’m Focused on My Relationship?,"I (34F) have been with my boyfriend (34M) for two years, and things are finally progressing toward the marriage and kids phase. We live two hours apart, so I spend most of my time at his house (I have an apartment). I work a hybrid corporate job where my apartment is located (in office 2x a week), he works a labor job with no flexibility, so I spend quite a bit of time at is place during most weeks. He's even renovating his house to make it girlfriend ready lol, less like a bachelor pad for us to live together, and we’ve talked about me eventually finding a fully remote job so we can settle down in one place.

Before this relationship, I was in a long-term relationship where we tried to conceive but had a hard time. The situation was incredibly painful—it took a toll on me emotionally, and the relationship eventually turned abusive. Now that I’m in a healthy, supportive relationship, it feels amazing to talk about the future, including starting a family. But instead of being happy for me, my best friend of 20 years seems more upset that I’m not spending as much time with her and my god children.

She and her high school sweetheart live together with their two kids (13 and 4). They never married (though she wanted that at some point). We used to hang out all the time when I was more local. But now, between my stressful job, job hunting, traveling, spending time with my family and his, and commuting between my place and my boyfriend’s, I don’t have the same amount of free time. Right now, we see each other maybe once a month or two. Lately, she’s been making comments like, “Don’t move in with him until he puts a ring on it,” an “You never have time for us anymore. (meaning her and the kids)”, or ""I see the only time we see you is if we come over"" (she has drove to my boyfriends or my apartment and we've just caught up for a few hours). We went to Puerto Rico this last July with our boyfriends for a week. I can also say that part of the problem is she wants to hangout, but the visits never really feel planned. She may text that on Monday that she wants to hangout Friday, Friday rolls around and I don’t hear from her until 6-7pm, and by then I’m already either settled in or doing something else. 

It’s starting to feel like she’s not supporting me or may be jealous (though I hate to think that). I understand my last relationship ended badly, but I’m in a much better place now. Plus, she didn’t wait for marriage before moving in with her husband or having kids, so it feels a bit hypocritical. It’s like she doesn’t understand that my life has changed, and I'm trying to build something that she already has.

I (30f) have a coworker (50sf) who I'd worked with for a couple years on the same team and was friendly with, saying good morning, asking about each other's weekends, etc. That was normal for everyone we worked with.

Six months ago she got assigned to train me and 6 other people on a program she'd worked for about a year.

45,1fo9bpx,AITA for expecting my partner to stick to timings for events / spending time together?,"Hi,

Have been with my partner for over 1 years now. We work different shift patterns - as a result of that, it can be very difficult to plan anything in advance.

This past Friday I wanted to have a lazy evening at home whilst he wanted to go out and drink with his friends. He said he would be back at a certain time and when it was getting close to that time he messaged saying his friend bought him another drink. I told him “Babe it’s really fine we’re not doing anything” so he could be there as long as he wanted. I was staying at home so it didn’t bother me at all.

Last night I’d managed to leave work earlier than usual. I told him this and he said he was going to meet one of his friends. We agreed he’d be back by 8:00 so we could then spend the rest of the evening together.

At 7:40 he says he’s finishing his glass and on his way. Our home is a 15 minute walk from where he was. It gets to 8:20 and I ask if he’s on he way and he say no he’s still there. I ask if he’s coming soon as we’d agreed to meet at 8:00 tonight. This goes back and forth for a while with me trying to explain how I think it’s rude and disrespectful to move arrangements like that without asking the partner and him saying it is not a big deal that he wants to spend a few more hours enjoying with his friends. He eventually comes home at 9:30.

I think if this was a once off occurrence then I could agree. Plans changes and things move. However, since we have met this has always been an issue. If we have agreed a time on doing something as a couple but he has gone out drinking with his friends before we’re supposed to meet, most of the time I will be the one whose made to wait until he’s finished and decides to come see me.

Other examples: during the day I will suggest we go to the gym together as a couple. He will agree to it in the afternoon. Once he is off work, he’ll go drinking with his friends and then say to me “no I don’t want to go now I’m too tired”. I feel if you agreed to go with me, you should stick by that and not cancel on your partner because you’ve been drinking with friends.

He mentions that I have done this to him as well. Last time I did this was c. 6 months ago. He says that is the same. Whilst I agree I should’ve gotten home sooner that night, I don’t agree that it is comparable given he does this every week at minimum and on occasion, multiple times a week. Yet he will use that one time to justify it every time he does it to me.

I’ve tried explaining to him that I feel like he is putting me as second best when he moves our plans to spend more time with his friends. It makes me feel as though I’m the dispensable. He says that “what I hate is that you make it an attack against you and that I don’t love you or respect you, rather than oh my boyfriend is enjoying his night”.

So Reddit, am I the asshole?

47,1fo8uur,AITA for pointing out someone's lack of English fluency in an argument?,"A fellow gym-goer (25) and myself (30) were part of a University lifting club, and since the club was going to be closed for the holidays, we decided to seek out a new gym to train at.

I volunteered to rent a car to drive to the gym (around 30 minutes) after our weekly club lifting session to sign a small group of about 7 other lifters all from the club as I had contacted the gym before to see this was possible. The renting was done through an app, but as they had just updated the software, there were quite a lot of issues and I ended up not being able to drive to the gym in time as it had closed.

I told other what happened and the other gym goer responded, ""Why didn't you take the bus?"". This was a simple question, but I took major offense to this. Not only was I tired from lifting for 2.5 hours, I volunteered my own time and money to organize and plan the whole thing myself. I have organized other trips for our club before, going to competitions and other gyms. Basically afterwards, an argument then ensued where he reiterated and defended his stance of that I should've just taken public transportation or even an Uber, while I said that it was never the plan to do so as it was quite far, and renting was cheaper than taking an Uber.

I went back to the gym and bumped into the other guy in the locker room and basically the argument continued in person. At that point, I had expended all of my points, and I felt that he was arguing for arguments sake as we were arguing over semantics. He did not relent, and in response to something he had said, I responded ""You didn't understand because your first language isn't English"". He didn't like that I said this, but the argument didn't escalate any further.

He is Southeast Asian and I myself am East Asian, and we were studying at a university in the UK, though I grew up in the West and he didn't. English isn't my first language, though I am most fluent in it, and I don't communicate to my family and partner in English.

We eventually return to the gym where his partner and his close buddy was and told them that I had ""...insulted his ethnicity, his race"". We eventually started out our own individual workouts, and I was physically and mentally tired from the ordeal. I had a defeated look on my face as I was laying on a bench during my rest. He makes eye contact with me, makes a pretend crying face with his fists, and starts laughing. His partner and buddy just look at me but don't say anything.

We haven't spoken nor seen each other since. There's another lifter in the University lifting group who is also from the same region as him, and after the argument, he's ignored all of my messages on social media, which makes me think the other guy told him something.

He says that if I were in his position, I would want him to take the flight with me (I'm not sure what I would do in his position). But we won't be sitting together on the flight. So I don't understand why he's so angry that I'm spending ""so much more money"" on the train. AITA, if I decide to take the train now?",4.0,0.0852315425872802,0,0
49,1fo869b,AITA - am i in the wrong?,"I 30F & my best friend 27F (Lucy) have recently had an argument over something which i find extremely childish. But she still believes i’m in the ‘wrong’.

For context there is another person involved in this story (31M Karl) & will give a small background. 
I met my best friend Lucy online gaming a good 3/4 years ago, & i’ve known Karl since i was 14/15 through mutual friends. 

Most evenings when i unwind for the night i’ll spend it gaming. 99% of the time i will always message Lucy to see if shes online or wants to game, OR i’ll see if she’s online and jump straight into a party with her.

On friday night (20/9) i had come back home from a wedding reception to Karl asking if i want to play some games & have a few drinks as we game. I was telling Lucy that we were going to play some games & drink but as it was late (she never stays up late) i didn’t think to invite her. (She also had a friend over who she’d been getting drunk with so another reason why i didnt think she’d want to join.) 
She messaged to ask if she could join us which i responded “of course you can!” 
Me & Karl were sat in a lobby waiting to hear back from Lucy before we readied up. After 10 minutes she messaged to say she was going to bed after throwing up. 

The following morning i came online to Karl inviting me to a party & asking if i’d like to play a souls game. I messaged Lucy asking if she’d like to join us & she said no. 
Fast forward to the evening i had come back online & loaded up the souls game with Karl. I said i was going to message Lucy asking if she’d like to join after i’d been to the bathroom. 
As i opened my phone to message her to ask if she would like to join, i had received a very arsey message saying “Wow, thanks for the invite then.” It hadn’t even been 5 minutes since i loaded up and went to the bathroom. 

Her issue is that she had to ask me to join us gaming on the 20/9 at about 11pm (god forbid i dont ask her if she wants to join considering i always ask 99% of the time) & how we loaded up the souls game in the evening THEN i asked if she wanted to join. She’s popping off because i “didnt give her the option to decide what we’re all playing together”. Even after i asked in the morning & SHE said no, i still even went to ask that evening if she wanted to join us but i didn’t get a chance within the 5 minutes of loading up and going to the bathroom. 
I just find all of this EXTREMELY childish. It feels like unless i’m gaming with solely her or ask her first before anyone else, she’ll go in a mood. But the one time SHE asks ME if she can join or the fact i loaded up THEN asked her if she wants to play with us is a massive issue. 
I’m lost. I’m really failing to see what in all of that is ‘wrong’ ?!? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-24,"AITA - am i in the wrong? I 30F & my best friend 27F (Lucy) have recently had an argument over something which i find extremely childish. But she still believes i’m in the ‘wrong’.

Couple weeks after the break up, she met a guy and she was hesitant to introduce him to us, so we let her be and let her do what she wants and thats when we started to drift apart. (Situation where she didn’t even talk to us anymore or just message us when she needs something)

Fast Forward, I could see her Facebook and she looked so happy with her new boyfriend, but as a concern friend that time, I warned her since she only met this guy weeks ago.

52,1fo6xzt,AITAH for not reaching out to my friend more? ,"
I (28M) have a best friend we'll call Erin (26F) who I've known for 13 years. We met online and spent most of our relationship long distance, but have always stayed close despite it. We both have heavy mental health problems and support each other where we can.  

About a year ago, I was leaving a failing marriage and needed to decide where to go next. Erin encouraged me to move to the city she lived in, and as I have family in the state I agreed. I got an apartment a few blocks from her.

At first we saw each other once or twice a week. Erin and her fiance would let me cover to do laundry. They'd even let me use their detergent as well as bring my dog with me. In return I'd make dinner for them. Since their finances were always shaky I tried to make big enough meals that they'd have some leftovers to keep. That lasted for a few months, but after two trips where I was turned away at the door because Erin forgot I was coming over and was asleep or hadnt cleared it with her fiance, I stopped. That drastically reduced how often we saw each other so we moved more to text but still hung out from time to time. It was common for Erin to cancel our plans and I'll admit that after the laundry incidents I was feeling rejected.

About a month and a half ago I invited her to go drinking with some coworkers and I. She agreed and wanted to bring some of her other friends too. In my excitement I might have been too demanding though. I asked Erin to pick the bar since I'm not familiar with the city, then asked if I could come over before so we could get ready together, and would she please help me with an outfit and my hair? Maybe it was too much or maybe her mental health tanked, I'm not sure. But she never got back to me about a bar, and day of was radio silence. I went out but most of my coworkers cancelled too and I hung out with just one of them. It was fun but I can admit I was in my feelings about it all. I decided I wasn't going to just change the subject and text Erin like nothing had happened, that I'd wait to see if she had anything to say for herself. 

I waited a month and caved. I asked her if she was doing okay and she replied saying she wasn't, that things were overwhelming, and she didn't want to get into it over text. I said okay and asked if she'd like to meet up so I could offer a shoulder to cry on. We agreed on a time for her to come over and I said I'd make dinner for her and that she could hang out as long as she needed. She didn't show and didn't text me. I sent her a message telling her when I was free in the next week and that she could come over whenever. Again nothing.

I could text her more or even swing by her place but I haven't done either. I miss and am worried about her, especially since some of the things she said were a bit scary as far as her safety is concerned. But I also still feel hurt and haven't done more than send a few short 'hey you good?' texts. AITAH? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-24,"AITAH for not reaching out to my friend more?

We always offer advice and encourage her to stand up for herself (either by reporting inappropriate behavior to higher ups or even suggesting she quit and we'd help her look for another job) but she always just shrugs it off and says that she knows she needs to find a new job but it's a lot of work and she's tired.

55,1fo5zqi,AITA: my roommate wants me to move out so his girlfriend can move in,"Me (29 M) and my roommate (27 M) have been best friends for almost 15 years. We grew up together in the prairies of Canada and had planned on moving to the west coast for quite some time.

He moved to the west coast about 7 years ago, then I moved here 4 years ago when I finished college. I moved in to the two bedroom basement suite he has been renting for about 5 years.

Lots of our other friends have lived here and moved out but currently it is just us two, and has been since I moved here. It may be worth noting there is no formal lease, we just pay cash to the family that lives upstairs.

It is worth noting that our place is well below the average price of the city. Known as one of the most expensive places to live, we are getting a great deal.

He has been dating his current girlfriend for just over a year now and just mentioned that they are starting to talk about moving in together. She lives in a studio apartment alone currently. He mentioned that they have been thinking about doing the move in about a year from now in August 2025, before she goes back to school. And that they have been looking at places here and there but are thinking that if she just moves in to our place, he wants me to move out so they can be alone.

This seems like a bit of an inconsiderate suggestion, when moving out would easily quadruple my rent payments. I understand he gave a lot of notice, and he has been at this place longer. But if they shared a one bedroom apartment, his rent would double (still somewhat affordable) and hers would be cut in half. I am completely open to her moving in with us, but that wasn't even mentioned.

I just have no reference it this is a normal suggestion, to me the normal options are to ask if it's cool if she moves in with us, or they move into their own place.
So, am I the asshole for thinking this is a strange suggestion?

TLDR: My roommate suggested that he might want his girlfriend to move in to our place, but he would want me to move out.

——————

edit:
The place we live in is cheap enough where either of us can afford it on our own, but a one bedroom alone is almost out of reach at either of our income.

But a 2x increase if he moved out or if I moved out and left him alone would be welcome given the extra space. This situation has been talked about in the past as he considered moving abroad a couple of years ago.

A feat which is basically impossible to do at the average rent costs in our city. (A very highly talked about topic locally)",Not the A-hole,2024-09-24,"AITA: my roommate wants me to move out so his girlfriend can move in Me (29 M) and my roommate (27 M) have been best friends for almost 15 years. We grew up together in the prairies of Canada and had planned on moving to the west coast for quite some time.

He moved to the west coast about 7 years ago, then I moved here 4 years ago when I finished college. I moved in to the two bedroom basement suite he has been renting for about 5 years.

Lots of our other friends have lived here and moved out but currently it is just us two, and has been since I moved here. It may be worth noting there is no formal lease, we just pay cash to the family that lives upstairs.

It is worth noting that our place is well below the average price of the city. Known as one of the most expensive places to live, we are getting a great deal.

He has been dating his current girlfriend for just over a year now and just mentioned that they are starting to talk about moving in together. She lives in a studio apartment alone currently. He mentioned that they have been thinking about doing the move in about a year from now in August 2025, before she goes back to school. And that they have been looking at places here and there but are thinking that if she just moves in to our place, he wants me to move out so they can be alone.

This seems like a bit of an inconsiderate suggestion, when moving out would easily quadruple my rent payments. I understand he gave a lot of notice, and he has been at this place longer. But if they shared a one bedroom apartment, his rent would double (still somewhat affordable) and hers would be cut in half. I am completely open to her moving in with us, but that wasn't even mentioned.

I just have no reference it this is a normal suggestion, to me the normal options are to ask if it's cool if she moves in with us, or they move into their own place.
So, am I the asshole for thinking this is a strange suggestion?

TLDR: My roommate suggested that he might want his girlfriend to move in to our place, but he would want me to move out.

——————

edit:
The place we live in is cheap enough where either of us can afford it on our own, but a one bedroom alone is almost out of reach at either of our income.

To really break it down, moving away from this place would 4x or 5x rent payments.

56,1fo5orq,AITA for refusing to take my ex’s nephews out after finding out my ex is dating someone new.,"I , 33 female, had a nasty breakup with my ex, 33 male. We met in high school and dated from ages 20-28. Long story short we broke up many times and among the reasons was cheating and STDs. He being the cheater. When we first started dating he was highly involved in his nephews lives. They were 3 and 1 at the time, now 16 and 14. In 2022, my ex and I started hanging out as friends again. I know bad idea. 

This lasted about a year and ended with him leaving me alone at night while on a trip in Boston. We had a small disagreement and he walked off with room keys, subway passes and credit cards. I had 10% battery on my phone and was able to hail an Uber to the hotel where I begged the front desk to give me access to the room. It’s been a year and a half and I still have no contact. His nephews lovingly refer to me as an aunt since they grew up very close to me. I’ve taken them out several times throughout the past year. We avoid discussing their uncle and when we do it’s them that initiates it. I politely change the subject. Times they have discussed him, they say he’s really let himself go, he’s a recluse and alone. 

We had always discussed if he ever dated anyone my access to the kids would stop out of respect for his partner. Call me weird but I think it’s weird having an ex hang out with your family. So last week I noticed on Facebook a name keeps popping up in my recommended friends. Curious I looked at the page and it’s his current girlfriend who he’s been for 5 months. He also hasn’t been a recluse. All the times I’ve taken them out have been bc he was with her. Essentially pawning off his nephews on me bc he was too busy. Now I don’t care that he’s dating someone. My feelings are long gone. My question is, do I discuss with his nephews? Halloween is coming up and I know they like me taking them to the events. Am I wrong for no longer doing so? Do I need to discuss with him? I prefer no contact but if I need to set a boundary I will.

57,1fo5jg6,AITAH for telling my boyfriend’s girl best friend to stop posting him? ,"
I (f 18) have been dating my boyfriend (m 18) for 2.5 years. He's become close a girl (f 18) because he'd help her with her mental health. This girl that l'll call Pam is bipolar and has other mental health issues. My boyfriend, that I'll call Dan, would sometimes go over to her house alone (with my permission) to help her with mental episodes. I eventually didn't like him going over alone and asked him to stop and he did. Pam didn't take this lightly and had a mental breakdown over it.
That calmed down after a while.

Recently Dan has gone to military boot camp and has not been able to text, is limited calls, and has barely anytime to write letters. Pam has been so upset over his absence and has been posting about him. She posted a video of her sobbing over him. This bothers me because it comes off as if she obsessed with him. And I doubt they have ever had any feelings to each other, but still.

Today I had enough and told her that she's been pushing my boundaries and asked her to stop posting so much about him. She just asked how I could have taken it the wrong way and I should have known better. She doesn't see how it could have bothered me. She claims she just misses her best friend. And that's fine, but I don't see the reason for posting about him so much. And some of my other friends have said it seemed like too much. 

Now I feel like a terrible person and that I should have never brought it up. All I wanted to do was set boundaries, but she took it as me trying to make her not be friends with my boyfriend anymore. And I told her I didn't care it they were friends. And now I feel like she'll tell mutual friends and they'll all turn on me. What’s your perspective on this?

Edit: many people are seeing the word permission and saying I’m controlling for giving it. I’ll explain. All I asked was for him to tell me when he was going there and he insisted that he’d ask to make sure it was okay. It was his decision to want that. Permission was a bad word to use and that’s my fault. Was just trying to shorten in up. If the roles were switched then this would still be the same and we’re both okay with that lol. 

And maybe people are saying it’s not my business what she posts. And I agree to an extent. I’ve had a couple people reach out to me and say her posts come off a little strong and anyone who doesn’t know the situation would think Pam and Dan are dating. And maybe I’m just jealous and crazy, but I didn’t like the thought of people thinking that’s true. And I didn’t like force Pam to not post, I asked her to tone her posts about him down. Like not as frequent and such. And again I was hesitant to even bring this up to her because I know she has bad mental health. This has been going on for a year and I haven’t said anything besides the house issue. Dan knows she bothers me and was texting her less frequently before boot camp because of that. I don’t believe anyone is right and I didn’t want to stress Dan out. I tried my best to have an adult ish conversation and tried to hear her out. It didn’t seem like she was understanding my pov, but I told her to take it into consideration. I know she’s attached to him, but I feel she needs to find another person for this comfort. And maybe that’s selfish of me and that I don’t understand her enough, but I felt my relationship with Dan will go south if I didn’t speak up. And Dan is very important to me and I trust him. My only issue with everything happening is the posts. I’ve been taking everyone’s POV into consideration and this is a complex situation so I don’t believe everyone is getting the full picture but I’m trying. I won’t bring this up to her anymore and I’ll have a conversation with Dan when he gets settled after boot camp. Thanks guys!

58,1fo5exx,AITA for just wanting an apology? ,"
I'm in a big fight with my two sisters (20F, 18F) after accidentally discovering they were talking shit about me. 

Context: I graduated college in May and asked my sisters for help cleaning out my dorm, which was a mess due to my close friend's sudden passing over the summer.

While they were there, my youngest sister, Eliza, vaped in the hallway on a dry campus. I panicked and asked her if she was an idiot. I was worried about people seeing on the cameras since I was an RA and knew what would happen if she was caught. My family thought I overreacted, but I apologized later. on, Eliza accepted, and I thought we moved past it. 

Later, while using Eliza's phone to call an RA, I accidentally opened a Snapchat conversation between her and my other sister, Elly. The reason I opened snapchat is because she told me I could use her phone. So I went to send a friend a video and I knew they were also friends on there. It automatically opened up to her and Ellys text convo and I saw messages about me, including mean comments like ""All she does is use people."" This hurt, especially since Eliza and I are so close. I confided in my mom, who was also surprised by Eliza's comments. 

After not speaking to Eliza for a while, she learned from my mom that I saw the messages and got upset for invading her privacy. Now, it’s been over a month without communication, and I just wanted an apology.

I’ve done a lot for Eliza, buying her concert tickets for her 18th and doing her school assignments to ensure she graduated. I admit I’ve treated Elly poorly in the past due to her own hurtful behavior towards me. Recently, my mom kept asking if I’d take Eliza to the concert next Saturday, but I told her I wanted an apology first.

Eliza texted me Saturday saying she was sorry and asked if I was done being mad, it escalated into another fight. I wanted a genuine apology for her comments about me, while she wanted me to apologize for ""invading her privacy."" 

Elly then messaged me seperately
saying more hurtful things about how I supposedly use people. I left her on read because I didn’t want to respond out of anger.

Today, Eliza texted, calling my message ""insane"" and accusing me of being immature. I’m feeling overwhelmed and decided not to respond to either of them. My mom thinks we should sit down and talk it out, but I dont think it will help. 

My mom's attempts at mediation have backfired, as she’s also talked negatively about me with them. Overall shes just instigating everything.


There are probably some things i'm missing, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

I met this online friend like around 10 years ago. I've never met her in real life. And it's not like we talk to each other every day. She was just an acquaintance. We became friends through this online community where we shared similar interests. But that was that. After that we were just following each other on Instagram but never spoke to each other.
During COVID she started an online business and I even purchased a few of her products because i really loved it and I was so crazily in awe of her talent and brain. I did talk to her at that time when I purchased her product and congratulated her for the business and wished her luck and told her I'll purchase more. But after the COVID I kind of lost interest in my job and wanted to try something else. I started a new business which was slightly different from hers. She even followed my business account and enquired about making a purchase but she didn't. After a few days she blocked my business insta account from her business insta account. I found this really weird. But I thought maybe she didn't like me starting something on my own which was kinda similar to hers. I didn't think much about it and continued doing mine. But unfortunately my business did not take off as expected.
People only wanted my products like hers. They were literally texting me and asking me to make it like hers since that was the one trending at that time. This was really getting out of hand and i had no other go but to do what the customers wanted.
So I did some research and by chance found the supplier from whom she had purchased the equipments for her business and I got them too and got into that business. I swear I did not feel good about this at all. I spoke to my family and friends and they suggested that I shouldn't feel all this guilt when it comes to business. After putting so much thought into this I started making the same products and sold them. During this whole time, I really wanted to reach out to her and let her know and have a good feeling about it. But I never did because i did not know how to have such a conversation. Months and months have passed now.
And today I got to know that she has removed me from her personal Instagram😅 I feel extremely horrible and feeling so down about it and I wish had had that conversation long back. Now I'm afraid that she thinks I'm an asshole to have copied her business.

61,1fo4u75,AITA is for bragging?,"I’ve been learning a new and difficult water sport lately and been picking it up pretty fast. Not insanely fast, but pretty fast. I don’t normally pick up sports this fast, so I was getting really excited about it. Making jokes like “this is my destiny” or “I’m going pro soon.” I also did make some more real comments like “I killed it today” or “man I’m just good at this sport.” That’s probably as braggy as it got.

Now for context tho, I brag about everyone. I dated a bro a while back whose motto was “heck ya.” He was so supportive, and it was honestly really nice. I since then have taken the same approach and always said “heck ya” when I saw someone killing it.

I have a good friend of 10 years, let’s name her Sally, who said I’ve been bragging too much. She called it exhausting. Ouch :/ Sally has an incredible life, lovely inside and out, a loving fiancé, beautiful community, and is a SHREDDER at her own respective sport. Like way better than me at my sports. I’ve literally taken my phone out in front of Sally and shown pics of how cool she is to other people.

I was surprised. I asked 5/6 other friends I’ve been talking with recently. None of them think I brag, but that I “get excited.” I don’t know if they’re being nice or not.

So I’m not really wondering if I’m the asshole… I AM wondering where people think the line is with bragging. When is it too much or too far? I’ve always thought it was a little self absorbed to be self-deprecating, versus just saying when you’re good at something--if it’s true. But maybe she has a point, and I don’t need to be talking about my own accomplishments too often.

When my sister let me know she wasn’t comfortable I offered that since we are getting ready in a two bedroom suite she can have one of the rooms to herself and just come out for hair and makeup. For context my step mom and step sister who she gets along with as well as a handful of other people will also be there and can hang out with her in the room and I am also willing to pop in and out. I want to be able to hang out and celebrate the day with everyone that I love. She proceeded to tell me that she will show up hours late and that is all that she is willing to do and that I am not respecting her boundary by asking her to just sit in the other room and not interact with our mom at all. I want to clarify that she told me when she would show up there was no conversation around what time will work (which could effect everyone getting ready since we have a larger group) and she would not give me a straight answer if she was coming or not. I had to keep asking, I would have dropped it but I needed to know for numbers sake and to preorder lunch for the day. This is not the first time she has dictated to me since getting engaged how an event she, my sister, was involved in was going to go, regardless if our mom was present or not. She has also dictated what pictures I am allowed to take as well as stated her friend gets to come early without asking me. I am hurt she cannot be there for me after saying she will and I am also frustrated that this is not a conversation but her dictating to me what I will be doing for my wedding since she is involved. I have tried to get to a middle ground but there is none unless she gets her way. She can’t be near our mom unless it’s to get her hair and make up done, not to be there for me on my wedding day but so she can have her hair and make up done professionally. So my question is would I be the asshole if I tell my sister she either shows up for majority of getting ready or she can find her own hair and makeup and meet us at the venue at the starting time?

For context I (F/25) and my husband (M/ 28) have been having several problems and arguments in our relationship. This is the most recent one. My mother in law has a total of 4 kids, my husband being one of them. Her youngest however, is eighteen and is special needs. And while I want to help my MIL and my brother in law, I can not all the time and neither can my husband. Lately, my MIL has been springing this on us, that when her son (M/18) is done with school that he can just walk to our house and stay there until she gets off of work. Again, let me express that I have no problem helping my MIL and BIL as they are family. That being said however, my MIL does not give us even 24 hours that she is doing this. She works full time and her schedule does rotate. However, she gets her schedule at least two weeks in advance, and never notifies us when she would like him to come over to our house. Instead, she waits until the day before to ask my husband if he can come by. My husband always says yes and doesn’t consider how I feel about it. He doesn’t consider if we already have company coming over that day, if our house has food or is a mess (we have a baby) or if I’m home at that time and just want to be home alone in my underwear with the baby. My MIL also has a habit of not asking my husband’s other two siblings (who also live extremely close by ) if he can stay with them when she can’t pick him up or if they can pick him up) because my husband always says ‘yes.’ He never says ‘no.’ I also feel upset by this because my MIL and BIL have a key to our house where as, my husband has told me he doesn’t want my father to have a key to our house because he doesn’t want my dad to just show up unexpectedly. This situation bothers me. It also bothers me because as a mother, my husband and I have to work around other people’s schedules as well as our own with the our baby and it just seems like my MIL has so sense of awareness of her responsibilities as a mother when it comes to her last child. As a parent, I feel that she should be making travel arrangements and stuff for him ahead of time not the night before. I understand things happen from time to time, but she does this EVERY time.

67,1fo4c1z,AITA for not giving my mum £100?,"My mum recently asked me for £100 from my student loan.

Last year, I started university but decided to live at home because my grandmother had passed away, and I wanted to stay close to my dad. In hindsight, I regret that decision. Since I’m no longer eligible for child benefits, my presence has become a financial burden for my mum.

Although I offered to contribute financially, she would refuse and only ask for the occasional £40 towards gas and electric. However, this often led to arguments about how I wasn’t contributing enough. She would demand rent, but when I asked for her bank details to transfer the money, she’d change her mind and revert to her original request.

Eventually, her car broke down. She decided to replace it rather than repair it, as both options cost roughly the same. At the time, I had already received my final student loan for the academic year and had budgeted just enough to cover my phone bill, food, and other necessities for the summer. My mum then asked me to lend her £300, promising to pay it back in £50 monthly installments.

After giving her the £300, she changed her mind and said that I owed her the money as “my keep” and that she wouldn’t be paying it back. I had to get by on whatever I had left, and my friends occasionally helped out. Because I had no money left, I ended up asking her to cover my phone bill a few times. My phone bill is £30 per month, and she paid for it three times, totaling £90.

Now that I’ve received my student loan again, she’s asking for the £90 back, rounded up to £100.

For context: I don’t know much about my mum’s finances. Whenever I’ve asked for details (like for school surveys), she gets offended. She works, but I know she also relies on benefits. I highly doubt she’s in severe financial hardship, as she’s able to buy new consoles, a VR headset for my brother, and other luxuries. She also has a new boyfriend who’s currently unemployed. She’s been spending money on food and beer for him, which might be adding to her financial strain.

I feel conflicted. Part of me feels like I should just be mature and give her the £100 since I’m an adult now. But my friends insist that I shouldn’t, especially since I’m struggling to find a job and can’t afford it right now.

I don’t know if I’m just straight up being selfish and ungrateful, or if I’m justified in feeling mugged off.

70,1fo3r6g,AITA for not telling my mom I talk to my bio dad after 27 yrs of lies?,"The night before I 27(F) graduated, my presumed dad’s (Joe 44) cousins and my aunt Amanda (mom’s sister (37)) were all over. Joe’s cousin AJ gives a speech congratulating me but then gives Joe a toast saying “it takes a strong man to step up and raise someone else’s child”. I let him finish then went to cry. My mom (42) came and said “AJ was away at college so he doesn’t know anything. Joe is your dad”. I believe her and things are fine until I get to college. I came home for a game and saw Joe’s cousin Ty who was with a woman and introduced me as Joe’s stepdaughter. I took it to the chin then called my mom crying after.. She said “Ty is a drunk”. He is a drunk so I believed her again. My mom and Joe ended up divorcing during my jr year of college. Eventually at 26 I couldn’t take not knowing so I went to see Joe and this is where it starts going off the hinges. I get to Joe’s house and start telling him everything above finally ending with “are you my biological father”. He says “no and I thought you knew this whole time”. Joe then says he met my mom when I was one. She never told him who my father was, only that he wasn’t in the picture. --Joe stepped up for me and I truly appreciate him for that.-- When I confronted my mom about it I initially left out speaking to Joe. She insisted he was my father until I told her. She then concocted multiple lies ultimately going with idk. This is all happening February ‘24. July ‘24 I see aTikTok video of a girl did a genealogy test and found her father. I bought an ancestry kit. Fast forward to August ‘24. My estimated results date said 9/2. I end up getting my results early. About 12pm on my 27th birthday I check my email and results are in. The results show I’m related to my Uncle John on my dad’s side. This is weird because Uncle John is my Grandfather’s (mom’s stepdad) brother so we aren’t actually supposed to be related by blood. I call my Amanda and talk to her. She wants to go with me due to my mom and I are more big sis/lil sis thanks to our age gap (15 years) if you get my drift. We get to my mom and she still tries to lie when I ask her who my dad is. I withheld the genealogy tidbit to see if she’d be honest. I tell her about the test. She then tells me that she and Adam (her stepbrother aka Grandfather’s son) use to be bed buddies. 27 years I’ve thought my biological father was my uncle. My mom told me Adam wanted nothing to do with me so she felt it was best for me to think of Joe as my dad. Upon talking to Adam he DID in fact want me but my mom told him I was better off without him every time he reached out. I know she said those things. She is now pretending that this was all for me when she was ashamed to admit she was knocking boots with Adam. She doesn't know I've talked to Adam. AITA for not telling her and seeing how far she'll take it?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-24,"AITA for not telling my mom I talk to my bio dad after 27 yrs of lies? The night before I 27(F) graduated, my presumed dad’s (Joe 44) cousins and my aunt Amanda (mom’s sister (37)) were all over. Joe’s cousin AJ gives a speech congratulating me but then gives Joe a toast saying “it takes a strong man to step up and raise someone else’s child”. I let him finish then went to cry. My mom (42) came and said “AJ was away at college so he doesn’t know anything. Joe is your dad”. I believe her and things are fine until I get to college. I came home for a game and saw Joe’s cousin Ty who was with a woman and introduced me as Joe’s stepdaughter. I took it to the chin then called my mom crying after.. She said “Ty is a drunk”. He is a drunk so I believed her again. My mom and Joe ended up divorcing during my jr year of college. Eventually at 26 I couldn’t take not knowing so I went to see Joe and this is where it starts going off the hinges. I get to Joe’s house and start telling him everything above finally ending with “are you my biological father”. He says “no and I thought you knew this whole time”. Joe then says he met my mom when I was one. She never told him who my father was, only that he wasn’t in the picture. --Joe stepped up for me and I truly appreciate him for that.-- When I confronted my mom about it I initially left out speaking to Joe. She insisted he was my father until I told her. She then concocted multiple lies ultimately going with idk. This is all happening February ‘24. July ‘24 I see aTikTok video of a girl did a genealogy test and found her father. I bought an ancestry kit. Fast forward to August ‘24. My estimated results date said 9/2.

71,1fo3pk2,AITA for calling my stepsister a b*tch after she complained about my wedding?,"  
I (24F) have never had a great relationship with my mother or my stepsister (25F). My parents divorced when I was just a few months old and my dad had primary custody when I was young. Both of my parents remarried very quickly after the divorce and both of my stepparents and my stepsister have been in my life for as long as I can remember. My dad is pretty wealthy while my mother and stepfather are not, so growing up I always had a lot of things that my stepsister couldn't afford. 

My stepsister was always jealous of me and constantly tried to one up me at everything. We were in the same grade in school so we were always competing in everything. Now that I'm older I understand it wasn't her fault when we were kids but she has continued to be awful to me. I can’t say too much because of the word limit, but she has done things to me that I can’t forgive. My mother has enabled her throughout all this. She has always resented me for being closer to my dad and stepmom.

My stepsister and I are both getting married next year. My wedding is in March and hers is in February. We both got engaged around the same time. In our culture, we usually have really big, long weddings. My dad is paying for mine and it’s gonna be pretty extravagant. My mother and stepfather are not able to give my stepsister as much money for her wedding. She’s been complaining about it ever since we started wedding planning. 

She’s been mad that my wedding is so soon after hers and she thinks that people are going to forget about her wedding and she’s going to be overshadowed. I went to my mother’s house on Saturday to meet my grandma. I was talking to her in her bedroom and showing her pictures of my outfits and other wedding stuff when my stepsister came in and joined the conversation. She was being really nice at first. She asked to see the stuff I was showing grandma so I showed her. She started asking about how much everything cost and I tried to avoid those questions but she kept asking so I told her. She got really mad after I told her everything. 

Apparently, a lot of the things I’m having at my wedding were things she wanted to but couldn’t afford. She yelled at me and said that I’m rude and insensitive for having her dream wedding so soon after her smaller wedding. My grandma tried to calm her down but she would not stop. She said I always try to upstage her at everything and was screaming at me. I told her to shut up and called her a bitch and told her that she cannot call me rude after almost ruining my life multiple times. 

My mom and stepfather weren’t home at the time and stepsister told them about the fight first so they believed her version of the story, where I was bragging about everything instead of just answering her questions and taunting her about being poor. My mom has been mad at me since then and said she’s not coming to my wedding. I kind of feel bad too because my stepsister probably felt bad seeing me have the wedding she also wanted and I was mean to her.

72,1fo3lwu,AITAH: for laughing and going on a new account after a girl was lying about me?,"So a little back story before I start.
I’m on this volleyball team, there’s about 18 people on the team. We are sorted into teams A, B, and C. Mind you team A being the best and C being kinda bad. Like bad. Never won a game. 
I’m not naming names or pointing fingers, so im calling her B instead of her name.

About a week ago I was finally moved up from C team and was placed on B team to sub for a girl. After that practice, B came up to me and told me “you played really good with me and the rest of the C team… obviously you aren’t a permanent member of B team since you don’t really fit in well, and some of us don’t like you! But normally when you’re on C team, you just let free balls drop!”
More back story. Nobody liked this girl, only boys. Everyone complained to the coach and said me or (another girl) should replace B and her her spot on B team.
Earlier today, she came up to me while we were setting up for our vball game, and said “if your gonna talk shtt about me, you can say it to my face.” 
Me: “sorry.. what?”
B: “you heard me. Next time you wanna talk shht, say it to me instead of your goofy ahh little friends”
I start laughing, because mind you, i do not like this girl and don’t want her name in my mouth.
Me: “ur thinking of a different (my name), cuz I don’t talk about you. I don’t even wanna talk about you”
B: “you think this is funny, huh?”
Me: “yeah u really do. You’re making up all ts for what? Attention?”
B: “well I know my worth and it’s a lot more than what you are and what you’re making me look like”
Me: “ur really full of yourself..”
B: “I am not!! Now stop talking shht about me and I’ll ignore ur ass”
Me: “can u tell me what “i said””
B: “you said that I think im better than everyone and I am so thanks”
I glance over to this other girl and I start laughing, and she does too.
B: “this isn’t funny!! You’re a bitch and probably have no money at home”
I’m still laughing, surprised and what she thinking of herself. Like yes, confidence is key. But know your limits.
B: “it’s sad that all your friends are fake asf and all came to me and said you talked bad about me”
Me: “bitch none of my friends even like you.. whatever ur on, gimmie some of that”
then B rolled her eyes and jumped at me, and yeah. I walked away.

Once the game started, the coach put B on the C team and I took her spot on the better team. She was pissed and flipped me off maybe 5 times while she was on the court. She asked the coach when she will get back into the B (better team) team and the coach responded with “you’ll have to prove that you are worthy of playing with B team. Now stop talking bad and go sit in the bench.

So yeah. am I the asshole?

74,1fo33nr,AITA for asking my husband what his second WhatsApp account is for?,"Our kids have just started school and they had a class WhatsApp group that the parents can join so we could see pictures of our kids at school. The link to join was sent to my husband via text but he didn’t know how it worked so I tried helping him out. 

As soon I clicked the link, it went to something called WhatsApp business and it asked for a code. I didn’t think anything of it first but then he refused to put the password in and got defensive when I asked him why he didn’t want to and what’s on there. He said it was business between him and his brother and that they don’t want anyone to know. 

I immediately got upset and told him wtf could be on there that you can’t show me? He ended up putting in the passcode after I kept questioning quickly and showing me for a split second and then getting out of the app right away so basically I didn’t get to really see anything. He told me that I shouldn’t be getting mad if I don’t tell him everything that he does and that it’s not my business. 

Honestly it really bothers me that he keeps secrets like that because what else is he keeping a secret? 

Anyway I let it go for a few weeks and then I brought it up again to see if maybe he’d be more open to tell me what that’s all about. But boy was I wrong. He almost instantly got mad and defensive and said that I’m always thinking he’s doing something wrong. 

Btw I never brought up infidelity or anything close to that, not even the first time when I found out about the other account. He yelled that’s it’s none of my business like 5 time in my face. I just stayed quiet after that and didn’t fight more because the more I talked or asked anything the angrier he got. 

Of course I was hurt after that so I didn’t say a word to him and then he said that I ruined the mood and that he’s going to sleep because he doesn’t have time for this.

75,1fo2uie,AITA in this situation regarding a group project?,"I don’t get sick often, but when I do, it’s serious.I was in a group for a college project and was supposed to set up a group chat at the start of January, but I got sick and forgot to do it.When I felt better, I saw a message from a teammate saying we needed to choose a topic quickly.I made the chat, apologized for being late, and explained I was sick.

By then, the group had already picked a topic while I was sick.As weeks went by, no one talked about the project.In the chat, they discussed missing classes and exam stress, but I didn’t reply since it wasn’t about the project.

A few days before the presentation was due, they decided to start working on it.I told them I would start my research that week.That weekend, both I and another group member were 
busy, and we informed our third partner.On Sunday night, I received many texts asking when I would start since the presentation was due Tuesday. 

I said I would finish it Monday, but they changed my part to something smaller without telling me.When I saw the messages, I was confused.They accused me of leaving them, even though they knew I was busy. On Monday morning, I finished my new part before both of them.One teammate who complained the most didn’t do most of her work, and the other girl did it for her.

When we worked on the paper, one girl was rude to me, so I responded because she was being disrespectful, which caused more issues.They set up a Zoom meeting, but I had a scholarship event then.When I asked for an earlier date, they couldn’t do it because they were busy.I added some information to the paper and tried not to let their complaints bother me.

In April, we had a presentation on a Thursday.They set up a Zoom meeting for Wednesday, and I planned to attend.However, I woke up sick that morning.I still joined the Zoom, coughing, and told them I might not come to class the next day due to being sick.It wasn’t a definite no.I tested and found out I had covid.They seemed to understand and support me.

The next morning, I felt awful, so I emailed my professor and my teammates to say I couldn’t make it.Two hours later, I got a rude message saying I was kicked out of the group because they thought I was trying to get a grade without doing work.They told the professor I hadn’t done anything, even though I did my work, just not a lot since they changed my part without telling me.One teammate was professional, but the other made mean comments like ""good luck passing without the PowerPoint because you can't present"" and ""you abandoned us.""

76,1fo2nia,WIBTA if I exposed all of my family to each other?,"So hey this is my first post so bear with me. I female 18 have kind of a lot of mess going on with my family. I have two cousins (f18 Lexi) and (f14 Danica) and I used to be really close with them. After graduating from high school and moving forward things changed and I guess that’s life. But they started acting weird towards me and my sister (f12 Camille) towards the middle/end of the summer. 

We ended up going little to no contact after my cousin (f18) asked for us. We started having some weird interactions again and she completely stopped talking to just me. When we were all just hanging out she told her mom she didn’t like me and didn’t want to be around me, why? Still trying to figure that part out myself. But that was the last thing I needed to fully cut them off completely. I don’t like being around people who only tolerate me. 

But a couple weeks ago we were celebrating our younger cousins birthday when everything really came to a head. My aunt (f25 Natalie)started to do the same things they were and complained about me asking her questions, and me texting her, but then tried to corner me outside the room and ask why I wasn’t talking to her. I kinda brushed her off because It’s all getting a bit outta hand and I don’t do all that childish nonsense. In the middle of the night her boyfriend came to stay in the hotel ( a man she met online and only met the family once) he stayed in the room with (f12 & f12 are Camille and Josie) (f18 & f14) then (f25) no one knew about this until the next morning I told my other aunt about because (f25) said she already told her anyways, but it turns out she didn’t. 

So we all got ready to leave and as we’re packing in the cars she catches an attitude because we’re riding with her (her mother is driving and she offered us a ride since we live five minutes away doesn’t make sense for us to get into the other car that’s going in the complete opposite direction). But my sister and I ignored it because no big deal as long as we all getting home. 

We get home and tell our mom everything and she’s upset about how all of it played out but mostly about the fact that she had a random man sleeping in the room with her daughter. She ends up getting my grandmother involved (we’re all usually pretty close) and they both agree that was wrong and my mom ends up calling her to tell her that. They ended up getting into an argument and blocking was done on a lot of parts. 

Fast forward to this passing weekend more drama happens because (f25) talks crap about my mother to me and I told my mother because that’s y’all drama and I’m not gonna sit here and let anyone talk about my mom. My mom ends up getting on her again and she texts me saying this is why she only talks to her other sister and her other niece and that she’s done with us because we’re messy and whatnot. Now said niece and aunt have talked the most about her than I can count of and I have screenshots to prove so.

I kinda brushed her off because It’s all getting a bit outta hand and I don’t do all that childish nonsense. In the middle of the night her boyfriend came to stay in the hotel ( a man she met online and only met the family once) he stayed in the room with (f12 & f12 are Camille and Josie) (f18 & f14) then (f25) no one knew about this until the next morning I told my other aunt about because (f25) said she already told her anyways, but it turns out she didn’t. 

So we all got ready to leave and as we’re packing in the cars she catches an attitude because we’re riding with her (her mother is driving and she offered us a ride since we live five minutes away doesn’t make sense for us to get into the other car that’s going in the complete opposite direction). But my sister and I ignored it because no big deal as long as we all getting home. 

We get home and tell our mom everything and she’s upset about how all of it played out but mostly about the fact that she had a random man sleeping in the room with her daughter. She ends up getting my grandmother involved (we’re all usually pretty close) and they both agree that was wrong and my mom ends up calling her to tell her that. They ended up getting into an argument and blocking was done on a lot of parts. 

Fast forward to this passing weekend more drama happens because (f25) talks crap about my mother to me and I told my mother because that’s y’all drama and I’m not gonna sit here and let anyone talk about my mom. My mom ends up getting on her again and she texts me saying this is why she only talks to her other sister and her other niece and that she’s done with us because we’re messy and whatnot. Now said niece and aunt have talked the most about her than I can count of and I have screenshots to prove so. Would It be petty to send screenshots on all parts since they keep bringing me into crap or should I just remain quiet still?",1.0,1.0039182901382446,1,1

My mother is very uppity about keeping the house in an un-lived-in state, nothing on the table, nothing on the counters, tea towels must be folded exactly right, bathmat must be placed exactly right etc. etc. When these rules are broken her only way of expressing that is by yelling. as a kid I thought this was the norm and I've never cared to fight it, I just fixed my mistake and moved on.

Since moving back, and having experienced keeping a house for myself (I lived alone) and having met people and their families, I've come to find that this isn't really usual. Most people's parents (that I've talked to) were capable of talking to them like people, and I've gained a real resentment for how she treats to me over these infractions.

I'm not going to bring up the other points of resentment unless its asked but there's been a lot of behavior that I've been told is odd.

Since moving back I've gotten quieter and quieter towards her, I give one word answers, I clock extra hours at work when she's home, I keep everything I own in my own room (including pots and pans, excluding food.) to avoid issues with where/how I store it. finally she asked me if there was something I wanted to talk about, and I told her I don't appreciate her yelling. She downright denies doing so and has since (2 weeks now) given me the silent treatment.

81,1fo13j3,AITA for giving a customer a senior discount without telling him?,"Until last month, I (23m) was working as a cashier at a thrift shop. On Thursdays, we offered a 10% discount for uni students/staff and seniors 55+. We had multiple signs up throughout the store advertising it.

On my last Thursday working there, I returned from a break and noticed a power scooter by the door that hadn't been there previously. I made a mental note to ask the SM who had been covering for me about it later if it was still there. Shortly thereafter, an older man walked up to me and said, “Some charity organization you guys are. Your managers take all the good stuff straight from the back and put it on hold for themselves”. I responded saying “Oh, well actually our store policy is that items do need to be priced and hit the sales floor before employees can put them on ho-"" he then cut me off saying ""NO THEY DON'T!"". I, taken aback, said “Uh..okay?”. The guy  then stormed away.

I was peeved with how he cut me off, seeing as I had worked there for over 2 years, and I had never seen this guy there ever, and he was acting like he knew what he was talking about and I didn't. About 10 min later, he came back to the register with a few items. As I was ringing him, I paged the SM who was covering me to come up front, who arrived shortly and confirmed the scooter belonged to a customer who asked him to hold it behind the counter while they shopped. I didn't call the older guy out overtly, but he heard the whole convo with my SM. As I finished ringing him, I put in a 10% senior discount. I offered him a receipt, but I don't recall if he accepted.

He returned the next day and approached me at the register with a few items and said“You didn't give me my senior discount yesterday. You were too busy talking to your manager about a scooter that I didn't even ask about. Your priorities are fucked"".

I was annoyed because while he didn't technically ""ask"" about the scooter, he was the one who made it an issue. I responded saying""I actually gave you a discount, on discount days I sometimes just give it to people auto-"" he then cut me off saying ""WELL YOU DIDN'T!"". I froze up, and started awkwardly ringing him up. As I did, he continued his critique. ""You're a disingenuous cashier, huh?"". I didn’t respond. He then said “You’re a piece of work you know that?”.

After I finished ringing him, he asked""What's yer name bud?"". I nervously told him I’d rather not say, to which he said ""Aight, I'll ask your coworker over there.""

He then approached my coworker and asked for my name, which they gave him. On his way out said to me, sarcastically, ""Thanks a bunch, DGW7601.""

I feel like he was way standoffish, however if he didn't take a receipt then he really had no way of knowing that I gave him a discount, and on my end it may have been worth apologizing offering a discount for that day, just to keep the peace. So, reddit, AITA for how I handled this situation?

I had a set of rules that everyone had issues with, such as: seatbelts (at the back too), no eating/drinking (water excepted), no distracting me (they would often try shoving their phones to me), and no blocking my blind spot by sitting weirdly (I don’t care if my car has blind spot monitoring; I prefer to check manually).

Everyone constantly grilled me for my rules and made fun of me for following the law. Yes, I admit I miss my exit a quarter of the time, but I won’t cut off other drivers or reverse just to save few minutes (an actual suggestion from them). One of my friends even said, “If I had a car, I wouldn’t drive like a grandma like you. You suck at driving.”

Suffice to say, I was relieved when one of my friends finally got a car and could be the group driver. At first, everyone roasted me in group chats and in real life, raving about how much more fun it was now that I wasn’t driving.

Five months after getting his license and car, my friend told everyone in the group chat that he’d been in a car crash and his car was totaled. He shared the dashcam footage and genuinely thought he wasn’t at fault, calling the other driver a “dumb typical female driver.” The footage showed him going 75 km/h in a 50 km/h zone on a blind curve. The other driver was turning right, and he hit her at full speed. Instead of braking, he honked. For some reason, neither he nor the other driver got a ticket.

I told him in the group chat that he was probably at fault, considering he was going 50% over the speed limit, on a blind curve, and just 100 meters from a 40 km/h school zone. Even if he had the right of way, insurance would deem him at fault due to his speed and slow reaction time. I told him not to send the footage to his insurance company. Of course, everyone in the chat called me a dumbass, and one of them said, “Bro, I live near that neighbourhood. My brother goes 80 on that street; everyone does. That lady was the idiot.” Since the cop didn’t ticket him and the group chat supported him, he sent the footage to his insurance company.

He was so confident that he started asking for suggestions on what new car to get once he received a “fat paycheck.” Everyone got hyped and started browsing Auto Trader. A week later, he got the verdict from his provider: he was deemed 100% at fault. He also had the cheapest insurance plan, so his insurance company paid nothing to him and only covered the other driver. Even if they had paid him something, he wouldn’t be able to afford insurance with his record as a young male.

83,1fo0dik,WIBTA for choosing not to go to the wedding of one of my closest friends?,"I (\~30F) have a friend, Jason (\~30M), who I met through work when we both moved to a new city for our jobs. He was one of the first people I met here, and we've been friends ever since. He supported me when I was going through a difficult time in my life. In general, we've always tried to be there for each other, in good times and in bad. Recently, however, some things have happened that have me reconsidering my friendship with Jason.

Jason started dating Natalia a couple of years ago. Without going into too much detail, I was optimistic at first, but as time went on, I grew less and less enthused about the match. I've had some bad interactions with Natalia where she's made off-putting comments towards me. Plus, whenever I've chatted with Jason about how things are going, he has mostly just shared arguments between them and/or contemplated breaking up. On top of that, according to Jason, Natalia has been pushing for him to propose since early on in their relationship, and he's always expressed reservations about that.

My husband and I try to avoid gossip, but we discussed it amongst ourselves and then eventually within our friend group. We realized that many of us share similar experiences and concerns. And while I think it's natural for Jason to talk to his friends about his relationship struggles, it seems like many of us have only ever heard (and experienced) the negative aspects.

Recently, Jason disclosed to me that he ""almost cheated"" with someone he met on a night out. I was floored, and I let Jason know that while I understood he had his doubts, I thought he was being disrespectful to Natalia. Jason agreed and said that he would ""likely break things off"". So, naturally, I was pretty shocked when they announced a few months later that they were getting engaged.

For context, Natalia immigrated to the US from a different country. At first, Jason said they'd be getting married in the US in late 2025. Then, out of the blue, Jason texted our friend group to let us know they're getting married in Natalia's home country in a few months. According to him, Natalia's family want them to get married soon, so they went ahead and planned the whole wedding for them. It's worth mentioning that Natalia has shared that her own family is pretty traditional and has been pressuring Natalia to get married for a long time.

I'm at a loss for what to do. On the one hand, I want to support my friend of many years, and I don't think my opinions should get in the way of that. On the other, it's been a roller coaster lately, and I'm concerned about Jason's behavior.

86,1fo01zu,AITA for not being able to financially support my Mother?,"I, (M18), live at home with my sister, mother and my mother's boyfriend. He is happy to give her money if she ever needs financial support as he has an **incredibly** good job, but understandably she doesn't like going to him because she says she 'wants to look after herself' and not have to rely on him. I work, but this year my hours were slashed and I've been actively looking for a new job that pays me well enough. 

My mum gets 25% of my paycheck every week as rent, and almost every month I end up giving her more, because I'll come home and she'll just stare at me with this anger in her eyes and say something like 'I only have x amount of money left to live on this month' - and so I ended up sending her more. She still tells me that I need to get a better job and 'sort things out' so that she can be financially supported by me. Here's my problem: 

My mum has a job, she just doesn't go in anymore, and relies on benefits from the government. Her job is happy to have her back, they even promoted her last time she had a period like this and went back, she's still allowed to go back, but it's as if she relies on me to give her my money. 

She sometimes snaps at me, especially if I spend any of my money on myself, like going out for food with friends last week, I got home and she went crazy about how I can only afford to pay her so little, but I could afford going to a fast-food restaurant. 

I understand where she comes from, because I agree as a working man I should be contributing to the household, but I feel like she doesn't treat me like her son anymore and I'm just someone who needs to make money for her. 

I would understand her more if she didn't go out so much, she goes out multiple times a week, often getting me to send her rent early so she has money to spend when she goes out for drinks and etc.

87,1fnzydo,AITA for ranting about my gf’s roommate/best friend to my friends? ,"Hey guys so l've (22F) been with my girlfriend (21F) for one year and half now. Since the beginning of our relationship it's always been a thing for us to spend as many nights sleeping together as possible. For us, this fulfills the needs we like in a relationship we switch on and off between sleeping at mine and hers. Her roommate is also her best friend and this year is their senior year of college and they previously lived with another girl but she moved so this is their first year living alone. That other girl was toxic and cause a lot of problems so they asked her to leave. 

During the summer my gf and I were long distance because of her internship. So with us both in the same city again we've been trying to spend every night together and her best friend told her today that she's not comfortable with me being over often because it feels like having a guest over. I thought we had gotten closer over time but I guessed wrong? She had previously brought up to my girlfriend that she missed spending one on one time with her at some point in the beginning of our relationship. My gf has seriously tried to make an effort but she’s a very busy student. Now she’s saying she also doesn’t want me over because it feels like I’m taking away the little moments she could be having with my gf as roommates. 

She said she was excited and looking forward to it just being finally them in the apt with no extra roommate. The thing is she knew that my gf likes having me over to share a bed for sleeping. Her best friend said this wasn’t a problem before when the other toxic roommate lives there because at least she wouldn’t feel like she was third wheeling or alone but the thing is my gf and I don’t even do PDA in font of her and everyone else we hangout with says they love us and haven’t expressed feeling like a third wheel.

I understand that in her eyes I’m intruding and it was never my intention so I am respecting her wishes and will be going over a lot less. I just always feel like she has something to complain about with us. She had asked us to not do PDA in front of her about 6 months ago and that was the first time we’ve had that request. I know my best friend would’ve said something if we’re too much cause she’s very honest with me but she hasn’t so this is only my gf’s best friend.  Now she has a new bf and she’s all over him too and it’s uncomfortable to watch and it seems hypocritical that she wanted us to change that. 

I feel conflicted because I don’t think she’s a bad person and she’s my gf’s best friend but I guess I didn’t expect her to feel like I’m almost taking away my gf when my gf is a great friend and really tries her best to hangout with them.

For context: Lori is a sweet girl but has this issue of having both self esteem issues while also viewing herself the center of the universe; especially if men are involved. Think Carrie Bradshaw from Sex and the City. It wasn’t the worst when life was less complicated but as post-grad life does get: it became complicated. There’s many examples of this but my biggest one was that my mother was chronically ill for years and it eventually became terminal. She passed away and I was devastated and it was traumatic experience all around. Kayla came to the funeral and was a rock for me, but Lori had to miss it because she got COVID. That I wasn’t mad about because obviously that is out of her control. But I was mad that the entirety of the funeral she was texting me how this was the worst thing ever because she couldn’t go to a party a guy she was hooking up with that weekend following the funeral. That I was mad about but I failed to say anything because well, I had much bigger things to stress about. 

Well, now Kayla is in the same boat. A very close family member of her is dying of the same illness and Kayla is devastated and Kayla had reached out to Lori for support and to break the news, and Lori (who now has a bf) said something along the lines of “Yeah I’m really upset too.

92,1for34p,AITA- Son lied for months then left,"My ex and I share custody of my 18 year old son.
Side note:(She is very much a social media, vanity parent. )He was supposed to start college this August. Ever since middle school he has talked about wanting to go away for college to get the full experience. Around March after spending months researching colleges, grants, scholarships etc with him, he out of the blue, announced he decided to go to a local community college, which is just about equal distance between both parents houses, and continue living at home.
Cue disappointment and I could tell he wasn't 100% on board with this either. (His mother has never liked the idea of him not being in arms reach. So I can take an experienced guess where this new plan hatched.) I helped him open a bank account and He worked all summer to save up for his first semester tuition. His choice. I told him I would pay for it the whole time. He ended up only needing help for books. No problem. I sent him a couple hundred to cover those and extra. In late June I saved a decent down payment and financed a $2000 laptop for him with the stipulation that it was for school. I am aware he will play games and watch movies or whatever as well but it was not to be used solely for entertainment. His specific courses would require really good laptop. About a week later he tells me he isnt going to class at all but doing online courses instead. This kid almost failed every class during Covid. He does not do well online. I later find out his mother told him she wouldn't drive him to school, so he has no choice.
Plus, he had apparently signed up for online back in May and been lying to me the whole time. (I would have picked up and dropped him off every day if I had to. My schedule is very flexible) Here's where the AH part comes into play. A few weeks later, the week before school was set to start he tells me he wants to live full time with his mother. Claims he can focus better at her house because he's always alone. I don't like it and 100% don't agree but he's 18 and I can't force him to stay.

AITA if I tell him he knew the laptop was for school and he made the choice to not attend voiding tr reason for my purchase.",Asshole,2024-09-24,"AITA- Son lied for months then left My ex and I share custody of my 18 year old son.
Side note:(She is very much a social media, vanity parent. )He was supposed to start college this August. Ever since middle school he has talked about wanting to go away for college to get the full experience. Around March after spending months researching colleges, grants, scholarships etc with him, he out of the blue, announced he decided to go to a local community college, which is just about equal distance between both parents houses, and continue living at home.
Cue disappointment and I could tell he wasn't 100% on board with this either. (His mother has never liked the idea of him not being in arms reach. So I can take an experienced guess where this new plan hatched.) I helped him open a bank account and He worked all summer to save up for his first semester tuition. His choice. I told him I would pay for it the whole time. He ended up only needing help for books. No problem. I sent him a couple hundred to cover those and extra. In late June I saved a decent down payment and financed a $2000 laptop for him with the stipulation that it was for school. I am aware he will play games and watch movies or whatever as well but it was not to be used solely for entertainment. His specific courses would require really good laptop. About a week later he tells me he isnt going to class at all but doing online courses instead. This kid almost failed every class during Covid. He does not do well online. I later find out his mother told him she wouldn't drive him to school, so he has no choice.
Plus, he had apparently signed up for online back in May and been lying to me the whole time. (I would have picked up and dropped him off every day if I had to. My schedule is very flexible) Here's where the AH part comes into play. A few weeks later, the week before school was set to start he tells me he wants to live full time with his mother. Claims he can focus better at her house because he's always alone. I don't like it and 100% don't agree but he's 18 and I can't force him to stay.

94,1foq7pi,AITA for moving to the US?,"I (33M) am currently planning to move to the US with my wife ‘Kat’ (30F) and baby from the UK. 

Kat is from the US and her parents still live there, and we are planning to move to her hometown to be closer to them. 

Kat’s mom has always been very involved in Kat’s life but not always in a helpful way. Eg she insisted that we had a child free wedding, although Kat’s best friend (one of the bridesmaids) had a very young baby. Kat didn’t want to argue with her mom about anything else (there had already been a lot of disagreement over stuff like venue), her family did pay for a lot of the wedding, and Kat didn’t want me to argue with her mom either so we ended up agreeing although it caused her friend significant trouble. 

We decided that Kat would move to the UK after our wedding in 2022 because it was where we met (at university) and spent 7 years together, Kat and I both love the area we live in, and our work is well remunerated here. My family are here but are a few hours away from where we live, and we’ve got a big group of friends including my three best friends I grew up with who we see regularly and enjoy hanging out with. 

Her family don’t like the UK. They make comments like how small the houses are and how far away she is from them etc. it puts a lot of pressure on kat and therefore me - eg we ended up upgrading our car to make their last visit better (so we could take them on road trips). 

We rent a place near my work but her parents wanted her to live somewhere nice so we ended up going for somewhere on the top end of our budget. Unfortunately Kat lost her job shortly after we married and hasn’t worked for almost 2 yrs. Since she stopped working her parents cover her rent but finances are tight.

I always wanted kids so when our baby was born I wanted to work less hours to look after her but haven’t been able to. Kat finds childcare quite stressful so I tend to do a lot of it. I love looking after her but it is making me tired and I haven’t seen my friends or family much and feel like I have no energy for my usual activities. I’ve gained some weight, don’t sleep well etc. 

After our daughter was born, Kat’s parents have been much more vocal about how they dislike the UK and wish we would move to the US. They’ve said they can help with childcare, finances and Kat’s job. Kat has started saying that she’s missing her family and how easy things would be there etc. I don’t personally want to live in the US but with all the pressure I decided that we should move.

When I told my friends and family I wanted to move they were shocked (because I always said I didn’t want to) and are upset because pretty much my entire support network can’t afford to visit us there. (Kat’s are very wealthy and can and have been visiting us at least twice a year) so they’re saying it feels like we’re leaving them completely and I’ll be at the mercy of Kat’s family.

95,1foq7g3,AITA for not telling my friend I used to hook up with her husband?,"Throwaway bc I don’t really use Reddit.

Anyway, I (32f) and my best friend “Bob” (47m) used to hookup 7yrs ago when we were both single. I’d just moved to town and we clicked instantly. I thought he was hot and really needed the stress relief at the time, so I asked if he’d be interested in a FWB thing and he was down. We hooked up a few times a week for about 3 months before I was asked out by my now husband, “Vic” (43m) and we stopped. 

Bob and I have never had any sort of romantic feelings for each other at any point. In fact, the entire time we were hooking up, he had feelings for “Linda” (41f), who he finally asked out about a year after I started dating Vic.

It’s a pretty small town so everyone knows everyone, and Linda and I were friendly but we weren’t really friends until after Bob and I stopped having sex. I’d go to the diner she owns and we’d chat and I’d subtly talk Bob up. Linda’s really sweet and I’m glad she and Bob got together. I helped pay for her wedding dress, build the chuppah (Linda is Jewish), set up and clean up the reception, etc. I have done everything to support their relationship because they are genuinely an amazing couple. Linda and I have been really good friends.

Well last week, Linda found out me and Bob used to hookup and now she’s not talking to anyone. I kind of assumed she already knew, I guess I expected Bob to mention it at some point, but apparently he hadn’t. He, like me, didn’t see what the big deal is supposed to be because we were never in a ”relationship”, we just had sex sometimes. It was never romantic, we never had candlelit dinners or walks on the beach, we’d just hang out and sometimes we’d have sex. It kind of felt like sharing a hobby, as far as intimacy goes, but every time I try to talk to her, she yells at me about “sleeping with her husband”.

The way I see it, I didn’t sleep with her husband, I slept with her neighbor. That she decided to later make him her husband is not my fault, and the fact that he didn’t tell her is also not my fault. I feel like if this is the type of information she wanted to have, it’s more his responsibility to share it, not mine. I genuinely don’t see the issue, so I came here hoping for another perspective.

throughout the rest of the day i tried to make it up to her by getting everyone to sing happy birthday, giving her lollies and making little gifts for her. but she was still acting weird towards me.

i understand her reaction but at the same time earlier in the year she came to my birthday party and still didn't know when my birthday was, didn't say happy birthday and didn't make me a card or anything. she even brought up that she didn't know when my birthday was and when i said she was at my party she just laughed and said 'well i don't remember that stuff'

102,1fonvkq,AITA for calling my friend fat?,"So, I just had this weird fight with my best friend yesterday and it's bugging me.

We were drinking a few beers and everything was fine, we were bantering and talking shit like we always do. Then, his buddy arrived and we all hanged out while they did some Molly. For some reason, he started acting like a tough guy and talking as if I'm some nerdy loser. They got into a conversation were it was like ""damn, from the outside it looks like we're setting up to rob (insert my name). Besides, I didn't like how he spilled some beer on my floor and then laughed to his buddy saying ""glad it's not my floor anyway"".

What the actual fuck. We've been friends for 12 years now. I love this idiot like he's my brother, we're privy to each other's problems and struggles in life, we help each other out and shit. I felt like he was making me feel like I'm less than they are. He was always there for me when I needed him the most, and suddenly he starts acting like he doesn't give two shits? Fuck off.

Anyhow, I started ""joking"" that he was getting way too fat to ""rob"" me or anything. Told him I'd probably run faster. He sarcastically asked ""oh, so you're some super fast athlete now?"" I just told him I was ""fast enough"".

This is so fucking stupid. What a stupid, immature fucking fight. I just told them I was going home and so I did.

I texted him earlier today saying I felt bad with the things he was saying and I took it to heart, but that I also didn't mean to hurt his feelings. He seemed very upset when I mentioned his body. I sincerely apologized and now I'm waiting for a response. He's probably not gonna answer right now, since he works the entire day in the service industry and it's very fast paced. 

He hasn't blocked me or removed me from anything, so I don't think he means to cut me off or anything. I'm pissed with his attitude once he took molly over here, as if he was some super tough guy and not an adopted brother to me.

Like I said, I explained how I perceived his comments and apologized. Hurts a lot, since we never actually fight and we've been friends from middle school to university. It would be a shame to end this over some immature bullshit, which is why I apologized for my comments too. I'd hate to lose my relationship over this stupid shit, I regret my part in escalating it and my heart is just heavy right now. Was I the asshole?

103,1fonp7m,AITA for telling my parents I don’t need them,"Hi my (18f) parents (52f) and (50m) have constantly been telling me I need to be better at keeping in touch with them. I currently have been living on my own for the past 3 months and I have been enjoying my solitude. I’m the kind of person who enjoys doing things I love whether it is by myself or with friends. I’m comfortable doing things alone. 

The issues started when after I moved out. My parents constantly are calling/texting me. I understand from their point of view they just want to talk to me and show support. My issue is, it feels a bit too much for me. I’ve always been the kind to do things myself and if I want help I will ask. They have been trying to give me tips and pointers on how to live on my own but it’s getting really annoying to me. I want to figure it out on my own and I don’t like extra commentary on things I already know/am going through; it’s just stating the obvious.

Last Sunday, they called and I decided to answer. At first it was just some small talk here and there but then they asked ‘why don’t you ever call us? We are always reaching out but it feels like you don’t want to talk to us?’ I kinda already knew that this is what they would’ve thought so I decided to just tell them honestly. I told them how I don’t feel homesick, I’ve settled in just fine, and I don’t feel like it’s necessary to keep them updated on my life. They took offense to all of this (expected) and told me how they need to know how I’m doing.

My parents will always ask if I’m homesick yet or if I want to come back home. I’m really happy in my apartment living independently. It’s getting frustrating for me because I am a very private person. I don’t really like sharing a lot about myself. After that phone call they are texting me saying how I need to keep in contact with them and I need to try reaching out more. They tell me I need to keep going to church (they’re Mormon I was raised that way but I don’t go and they don’t know that). I just feel like the reason I moved out was so I didn’t have to listen to them anymore on how I need to live and yet it feels like they want to keep telling me how to live. Some part of me knows they’re just my parents and they care about me, but the other part is so annoyed having them still be breathing down my neck on how I should be living outside of their home, so AITA?

Edit: some people say I should add this note about my parents and Mormonism. For anyone unaware there is an app for Mormons who put in their information to be able to find other Mormons around them. I have never used this app and never plan too. The thing is anyone can put you in it. My parents being the Mormon people they are (out of their hearts) put my information into the app. This all includes my name, date of birth and my address. So anyone who is Mormon would be able to find me and contact me. They also contacted the bishop of my area and are talking to him about me and if I’m going to church/how I am doing in the church. And the calling/texting is not happening every other day, it is EVERY DAY.

I feel like I should clarify what kind of calls I’m getting from them. These call are not the ‘hi how are you doing’ ‘are you doing ok?’ ‘I love you’ kinda calls. Most of the time they are asking things like ‘have you done your dishes?’ ‘Did you do your laundry? Make sure you’re doing your laundry.’ ‘Did you make your bed?’ ‘Did you clean your room?’ ‘Have you met any cute boys?’ ‘Remember, only returned missionaries for you.’ ‘Did you go to church? You need to always go to church.’ ‘Make sure to say your prayers and read the scriptures.’ It’s exhausting sometimes.

Also I am one of the youngest of the children in my family (second to last) so I definitely have felt like me trying to be independent is almost like a joke.

104,1fon7y9,AITA for moving out before 2 years on a co-owned house? ,"I (26M) and my brother (22M) bought a house together in July 2023 and took out a construction loan for renovations. I have a full-time job, so I couldn’t get to the house until around 3-4pm most days, but my brother, who works part-time for our dad, had more flexibility. I would work on the house every evening until 8pm, while my brother handled more of the daytime work. Despite my efforts, he later accused me of not helping enough.

From the start, I made it clear I didn’t want to live in the house with him for 2 years, especially since I’m in a relationship. He was the one who suggested my girlfriend move in, which I had planned to discuss but he brought up first. Once we finished the renovation and moved in, things went downhill. My brother was a terrible roommate, acting like a typical 21-year-old, but the disrespect was out of control. I avoided confronting him to keep the peace, but at a family event, he blindsided me. He accused me of being lazy, saying I didn’t contribute enough to the renovation, and even suggested I shouldn’t be part of the deal anymore, wanting to buy me out. He also criticized the work I did on smaller projects, like painting trim, while he handled cutting the boards (poorly, I might add). Ironically, he refused to let me help with the tasks he now holds against me.

What really stung was that I fronted most of the money to keep the project going. My brother ran out of funds a few days in, and I had to cover almost everything after that. He only contributed to one part of the renovation, which ended up being a disaster, forcing me to hire someone else to fix it. If I hadn’t stepped in financially, we’d still be working on the house.

During the renovation, my brother and dad (who both work in construction) would often argue while I continued working on smaller tasks or cleaning up. They never involved me in those discussions because they didn’t value my input, even though I’ve worked in electrical for a few years.

When it came time to discuss moving out, I brought up the idea with my brother. Surprisingly, he was on board and talked about moving his friends and girlfriend in. I confirmed with others that he was fine with it. However, I later found out he had been lying the whole time—he didn’t want me to stay involved at all, just out completely. My mom even advised me to move out for the sake of our relationship.

What really bothers me is that I feel completely taken advantage of. I gave my brother an opportunity at 21 that I never had, and now he’s painting me as lazy and trying to cut me out. He’s using our dad to cosign a new deal, while I’m left dealing with taxes and the stigma of being seen as the person who didn’t contribute.

105,1fomyp1,AITA for asking another mom if I could help with her daughter's hair?,"My daughter (9) recently made a new friend. The friend is adopted, she's black and her parents are white. We've had her around our house a lot the last few months and we've noticed that her parent's don't really know how to look after her hair.

I'm white and my husband is mixed. His black grandmother lives with us and she has pointed out the girl's hair and even tried to give her some haircare advice. 

I decided to bring up with the mom about her daughter's hair and that my husband's grandma was happy to give some advice or even wash/detangle and braid her hair.

The mom was really upset that I would suggest she couldn't take care of her daughter properly and that I was overstepping boundaries. I told her that my grandma-in-law just wanted to help her to help her daughter. She told me I was being rude and undermining her parenting. She also told me I wasn't the first person to bring this up.

I'm worried now because I really didn't think she would react like that. I'm worried I've ruined my daughter's new friendship. I understand why she's upset at thinking I'm trying to suggests she's not looking after her daughter properly.

I'm a 20 year old disabled student in a program made to teach disabled people how to get and keep a job. I had to quit my recent job due to some personal issues that I won't get into. When I went to turn in my letter, we began to talk and I casually told her that I was moving over the summer. Not a big deal right? Wrong apparently because today I got a text from my mother saying that I shouldn't have told her because she hasn't told her job yet about her quitting. She got mad and said I was being lazy. (I have depression, ADHD and autism, which make phone calls a pain) I sent her screenshots as proof that I texted her  and she stated that she wasn't ready to tell anyone yet, which I find a bit odd because 

1. This is a plan that has been set for at least two school years 

2. She didn't think to tell me that she wanted it a secret. I had no idea at all.

I honestly wouldn't have been so mad about it if she didn't drop the bomb of her wanting it a secret. I felt honestly really bad and apologized. (I'm also terrified of my mom being angry but that's common) I even unloaded the dishwasher and scrubbed down this pan that didn't get washed properly today dispuite staying home and being sick to avoid any wrath. 

I honestly don't know what to do or if I'll need to do any damage control.

107,1fomosb,AITA for not responding to my mom?,"I (28f) have a very difficult relationship with my mother and haven’t seen her for years. She struggles with addictive behaviors with strong medication. I have accepted that she isn’t going to be my description of a caring mother and she has a disease that is not easily curable. 

I haven’t seen her for years but will answer her phone calls and try to call her occasionally. Every time I talk to her, she tells me about how her new medication makes her feel wonderful. Doesn’t matter why we were chatting in the first place, it ALWAYS comes back to how wonderful she feels only for her to have more and more issues/hospitalizations later. She doesn’t know much about my life and hasn’t met my bf of 3 years because her behavior is so unpredictable and I don’t want to put my significant other in a scary situation.

She called me the other morning and I let the call go to voicemail because I was getting ready for work and I figured I didn’t have time to discuss her meds yet again (she swears she doesn’t remember our precious conversations at all). 

She texted me immediately after leaving a voicemail and she said, “I want to give you my grandma silver. I know it would mean a lot to you.”

I was very close with my late great-grandmother and my mom is right.. it actually would mean a lot to me to have something of hers to pass on through my future kids/family. However, I didn’t respond.

I feel like I could be TA for not responding but in my defense, this feels like a manipulation tactic on her end. She keeps asking me to see her and I haven’t due to her unsafe/addict behavior. She doesn’t normally offer me anything. My grandfather (her dad) and I are very close. He understands where I’m coming from but doesn’t see it my way. He’s very much so “Talk to your mother because she’s the only one you have” mindset. My dad and her divorced when I was a teen due to her toxicity and even he would be telling me that she’s just trying to be nice.

108,1fom8cl,AITA for having ago at my partner for pouring my milk away? ,"This happened a few days ago, but I (28F) can't seem to stop thinking about how my partner (31M) throw away my milk, after buying new. (Also, apologies for any grammar/spelling mistakes, typing at work and have dyslexia)

So a little background on me, I was raised with if something has a Use By date, throw away when it's gone pasted that date. If it has a Best Before date, keep checking before use and throw away when bad. Also, my partner and I don't live together, he comes round mine as he has roommates and my roommate is my cat.

On to the event, it started when I asked my partner to please not use too much milk as it's been an expensive month and I'm wait for pay day to do a big shop. I know he likes having a few teas in the morning about two or three and I had about a pint and half left. The milk in my fridge was a couple days out of date but didn't smell and no lumps, so still good!

We were planning on going out to eat, so I asked if I can get my car beforehand to get that task out the way, which he agreed. On the way back from collecting my car, he asked to stop at the shop to grad a few bits and noticed he picked up some milk for me. Which was very sweet of him and did say he didn't have too. After getting back to mine, he went in to drop the shopping off while sorted my car, as he wasn't going to take that long. 

As we were walking to the pub to get something to eat, he noticed I unsent a message and asked about it. It was just me asking where to meet back up, as he took longer than I thought, but then saw him walking towards me, so deleted the message. That's when he said he had poured the milk away as I now have a new one, like what?! He soon started explaining himself after he saw my face, but I was just shocked and upset. When he was done explaining, I told him that yes the milk was pasted the date but it's best before if kept right you can make it last longer and if I was round his I wouldn't have throw anything away without asking first. He apologised and I did as well for having ago, but I could tell he still didn't understand why his action annoyed me.  

I do feel silly for having ago, but at the same time I feel like he wasted money by pouring it away and doing it without asking me first. I know he brought a replacement and meant well, so AITA for having ago at him?

Side note: we do laugh about it and he promised not to throw/pour anything away without asking me first, unless it has gone bad (mouldy/lumpy)!",Asshole,2024-09-24,"AITA for having ago at my partner for pouring my milk away?

109,1foeyrw,WIBTA if I walk away from helping my family?,"I, 47f, am completely fed up with my family's bullshit.  I am divorced, and almost done raising my kids, the youngest turns 18 next month.  My mother is disabled, but lives alone, she is terrible with money (this plays into the overall issue).  My sister, Liza, 42f, has recently been divorced and has moved home from out of state.  Liza has over the past few years been consistently getting worse in her overall mental health.  She attacked her ex husband which ulitmately ended the marriage, he has full custody of her 3 kids.  She has become a hermit, doesnt bathe, her house is filthy (garbage stacked 2 ft high on countertops) and she refuses to work.  She is having ""episodes"" of delusions (she believes she is a CIA operative, was kidnapped from the royal family and is a true princess).  The money she received from her divorce is gone.  And next week the last of her inheritance from my father is gone.  She refuses to let mom help her, as that is the person she claims has ""kidnapped"" her. Mom is not finacially able to help her.  I help pay my mothers bills because she is so terrible at money.  Now my sister will lose her home, the one I helped her get (she paid, I did paperwork).  She will be losing her car and her light bill is due. 

 Everyone in my family expects me to help her and mom. I am the only one who in a financial shape to help (I took my part of the inheritance and purchased 2 rentals, plus paid off my home and car).  I draw a decent amount of pay from my job, but I am by no means rich.  If I didn't pay out to help my mom and my sister so much, I would be decently comfortable financially.  From the back story, you should see my overall issues with my family.  I am expected to clean my sisters home, I have been asked to pay for the car and the light bill, plus all groceries for her home, after next month, her lot rent is due.  If I added it all up, its about $1200 a month.  We have called crisis team out twice on my sister and they can't legally make her go into an institution because the law states that she must be harming herself or others.  I am trying to get my sister on disability, but she refuses to cooperate.  She claims she isn't crazy and that the bible states the government must give her money to live. 

 So WIBTA if I just walked away from everyone?  I am at my wits end, I have no peace in my life, I have no life outside of what mom and Liza need.
