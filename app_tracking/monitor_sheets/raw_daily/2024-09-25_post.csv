0,1fozb0l,AITA for not paying attention in my geography class anymore?,"First off to start I am not a homophobic person, I have a cousin who is bi and we stay close. 
My geography teacher is gender fluid I think and for the past 5 classes we have been taking notes on Ted talk videos of trans people and their experiences and learning what different terms different parts of the world use to describe LGBT people.

1,1foz6e9,WIBTA if i ask my cousin to be hygienic and wear formal clothes I‚Äôm buying for my wedding ,"My (F37) wedding is a formal affair to be held at Christmastime at our country‚Äôs largest and grandest cathedral. Despite this, the wedding is a small-ish family affair with some friends and obligatory work people (my boss) invited. 

Our theme is the formal national dress of our country. This means a shirt called barong for the men, and conservative long dress for the women. There is no color prescribed, and the ladies could wear white/offwhite if their formal wear is that color because the national dress for women often comes in those colors. 

I have a cousin who identifies as nonbinary. They are 19, and very deeply introverted. I asked them if it will be ok if they will not be part of the bridal party since our cathedral rites are very conservative. They said no sure they would not rather be and besides, the last time they were asked to be in the bridal party for another relative‚Äôs church wedding, they did not enjoy it. So I said cool, they will be my honored guest. 

I asked what they are comfortable wearing, since this is a formal event, and they answered, anything that is not a girly girl dress. I understood and I offered a very nice pair of dressy trousers and that we will look online for nice loose blouses/shirts that will be dressy enough. We are still looking right now.

I am also buying some of my other male relatives‚Äô formal top wear but budget is so limited at this point so they have to take care of the bottom part since I cannot buy that too. They all agreed that that is fair, because they get to keep the top. 

Now my nonbinary cousin does not have the best hygiene. During our grandmother‚Äôs 80th birthday at another formal event, they‚Ä¶.. neglected to comb their hair or brush their teeth to the point that I could see the remnants of her breakfast, let alone smell it. 

I want to tell them that gender expression and identity is one thing that one can freely decide on. But events are another thing. One has to brush one‚Äôs teeth, iron clothes or at least make sure they are presentable, and for the love of everything holy please take a bath and wear deodorant. 

They have problems at home, everything from financial to self-esteem issues to basically their parents giving up on them because they refuse to talk. I don‚Äôt know how deep the problems are. But I know their house has two showers and that despite being poor their father and mother regularly buy soap and other essentials. The enforcement is the one that is lacking I think.

I‚Äôve purchased most of my cousins/entourage‚Äôs clothes, and some are still pending shipping. Once they are all there, I plan to put them in nice bags and add a thank you card.  

Would I be the asshole/how can I avoid being the asshole if I tell my cousin to please use the hygiene kit included in their clothes? Is it a good idea to sneak in some deodorant and an array of soaps in the wedding clothes pack? 

For reference I am F37, identify as semi-religious. My future husband (M40) and I chose the great cathedral as our wedding venue because that place is significant to us both when we were both in college long aho, and it looks prettiest at Christmastime.

3,1fpdcgn,AITA for telling my best friend she can be bitchy and mean?,"So I (26F) have been best friends with ‚ÄúEmily‚Äù (26F) since childhood. We‚Äôve had a long-distance friendship for the past 8-10 years, so we only get to spend a couple of days together each year. Recently, we‚Äôve been staying together in our hometown, and I‚Äôve had the chance to observe her behavior more closely. She often says hurtful things to her family members and doesn‚Äôt really pay attention to conversations. She‚Äôll pull out her phone in the middle of me telling her a story and start watching or reading something. She also subtly criticizes my interests and often finds something negative about everything I share with her. She‚Äôs very judgmental and critical of other people but expects everyone to accept her as she is.

Emily has mentioned in the past that her boyfriend feels she can be mean to him and that he‚Äôs often ‚Äúafraid‚Äù to say the wrong thing around her. I‚Äôve never really seen them interact for long periods, so I wasn‚Äôt sure how their relationship actually worked.

Today, we were having coffee, and out of nowhere, she asked me how I see her as a person. Naturally, I was curious about the context of her question. She explained that her boyfriend and some male friends have told her that she‚Äôs ‚Äúbitchy, mean, and aggressive.‚Äù She wanted to know if I felt the same way because that‚Äôs not how she sees herself. 

I hesitated but eventually told her that she can be mean and hurtful at times, and it often seems like she doesn‚Äôt consider other people‚Äôs feelings. Of course, she asked for examples, and I gave her one (which I won‚Äôt include here as it‚Äôs quite personal). Her response was that she believes her comments are fair and that her perception of herself is different; she sees herself as sensitive, sentimental and someone who treats people the way they deserve.

I suggested that if she acted more in line with that perception, she might feel more comfortable showing her softer side. She fell silent and looked upset, so I asked if she was hurt by what people were saying. She said she didn‚Äôt care about people‚Äôs opinions and wouldn‚Äôt change anything about her behaviour but wanted honesty from those close to her. I pointed out that if she doesn‚Äôt feel the need to change, then there‚Äôs little reason for people to open up about their feelings and show vulnerability, especially if it won‚Äôt lead to any change.

Then she hit me with, ‚ÄúBut you haven‚Äôt shown any vulnerability.‚Äù I replied that I wasn‚Äôt talking about myself and it wasn‚Äôt about me expressing my feelings. After a long silence, I asked if she was sad about our conversation, to which she replied, ‚ÄúNo, but even if I am, so what?‚Äù. I suggested we talk about it, but she said no.

Since then, things have been awkward. She‚Äôs been distant all evening, and we haven‚Äôt talked much. I‚Äôm hesitant to bring it up again, especially since she hasn‚Äôt initiated any conversation.

Before moving I had lined up a 6 figure job but lost the job fairly quickly after relocating for various reasons. Primarily due to budget cuts.

As a result of losing my job our home went from one sustainable income to two unsustainable incomes and our finances have continued to be strained. In order to offset some of the financial burden, we decided to add a roommate to our lease in our two bedroom apartment. In order to make room for a new roommate, we cleaned out the space, sold the various pieces of office furniture we had and thoroughly cleaned the room and disinfected all areas. 

The problems started soon after move in. They started complaining about the bug situation which we explained was not due to our cleanliness standards but because we live in an apartment complex where we cannot control how other people live or what kinds of pests they allow in their homes. Fast forward two weeks when our rent in due on September 1st and we hear from our roommate that we will be receiving their portion of the rent on the 6th. This is a problem for us because our management company is extremely litigious and will file an eviction notice after the 8th of the month. My wife and I cannot afford to have this on our record considering we want to buy a house in the next three years. On the 6th, we texted them asking for the rent money only to hear that they spent their portion of the rent on a down payment on a new apartment without telling us and would be moving out this month. They said they would now be paying on the 23rd or 24th but promise to pay for the remainder of the time their things are here. The problem is, my wife and I spent our entire savings on paying that month's rent half of which is her responsibility being on the lease.
When the 23rd came and went, we followed up looking for our reimbursement and they gave a new move out a payment date of the following week. We have now been stiffed on the rent payment twice and are effectively storing a bunch of this persons belongings and relying on their word that the move out date is coming soon. We can't list the room or get new prospective tenants until their stuff is gone and we are incredibly concerned about actually getting the amount we are owed. We've looked into it and as co-tenants we can't legally evict them or put their stuff out so it feels like a hellish waiting game to see if they keep their promise for the first time this month.

I'm going to preface this by saying that Pus barely got any love, the most they did was feed her and let her outside. Her ""owner"" was boyfriend's sister, (13F) let's call her Mia. Mia literally never touched this cat, pet her, fed her, nothing. Nobody played with her, she was barely even their cat and spent 90% of her time outside, so I'm going to say that this cat was more boyfriend's mother despite my boyfriend being the one to take care of her whilst being allergic.

I didn't have an issue with them letting her be an outdoor cat until I took into consideration that she had lived so close to very busy roads, which was unsafe for the cat and they should consider making her an indoor cat. Boyfriend's mother, (let's call her Anne) was extremely angry at me for this. I took it no further because despite my best efforts this was just ruining my relationship with my boyfriend's family.

The cat, sadly, ended up passing away after being ran over on the highway. This was absolutely tragic, and I was very upset by it because I loved that cat and she had many years of life ahead of her. But when I saw that Anne was planning to get a new cat the exact day Pus passed away, I couldn't help but feel she didn't care at all.

The next day, they got a new kitten. I was quite upset with this as they didn't leave time to mourn at all, and I took issue with Anne, telling her that I'm not calling her a bad owner, or saying she shouldn't have cats, but to please take proper care of this kitten as he will live his entire life with her and I don't want the same for him as what happened to Pus. 

She was enraged, telling me that I can't tell her whether she care about her cat or not, which she is right, I can't, but I never did. I told her that this kitten has needs, the same Pus did that weren't accounted for. I didn't want that future for the kitten. The fact that they did not even mourn her death doesn't indicate they cared about her in any way. All I wanted was for this kitten to have a better life, but Anne is treating me like I'm completely evil.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-25,"AITA for telling my boyfriend's mother how to take care of her cat?

10,1fpcj4e,AITA for leaving when family was late to meet me for breakfast on my birthday?,"I want to start this by saying I love my family more than anything. Even though they piss me off sometimes, they're my people, be nice to them or I will hunt you down. 

So today is my birthday. About a week ago my mother and sisters made plans to meet me at a little brunch spot in the city near her house; only a short drive away. We agreed to meet at 0700. My mom was driving my younger sisters who still live with her. I was driving in from out of town. 

Something to know about me is that I can't stand being late. It makes me feel sick in a literal sense, so I plan to be places early. So despite getting stuck waiting on a train I still showed up to the dinner at 0650. 

Something to know about my Mom (who i love dearly) is that she is always late, no matter the occasion. Both of my sisters get truancy notices every year because they get dropped off late regularly. I think the only reason my mother hasn't been fired is because she has a government job. 

Well I hurry up and start waiting. At 0720 I get a text from my sister saying ""sorry brother, mom slept in today. We're running late"". I'm pretty upset at this point. I think to myself this is just her showing no respect for my time, or really me. I cant help but think of all the other times people have taken advantage of my patience. At this point I don't want to have breakfast anymore. I call my mom but she doesn't answer. I wait another 3 minutes, before texting her saying ""I'm leaving"". Then I leave. 

Well almost immediately after I left mom calls me and asks where I am. I tell her I left. She starts talking about all the things she's done for me, and that's it's wrong I couldn't even give her a 10 minute grace period. I say ""oh I see, *I'M* the asshole here"" and I hang up. I know arguments are pointless because nobody changes their minds. 

Well I haven't heard from my mother, but my little sisters are upset with me. I do feel bad about that. They're truly innocent, just in a bad position. I wish I was stronger for them, we all could've had a good morning.

11,1fpci1c,AITA for telling my longtime friend I don't want to take an international trip with her because we have very different vacationing styles?,"TL;DR I told my friend of 14 years that I think our vacationing styles are too different, and that I can't share a hotel room with her when she shared a travel deal, she came across and she hasn't responded. AITA?

¬†

Apologies, this will be a little longwinded, but there is a lot of context I feel I need to share.

My friend and I (both F and in our early 30s) have known each other for almost 14 years. We met in university and became fast friends. We shared the same social circle and hung out a lot, but never lived together. Since graduating we have visited one another in our respective cities probably close to a dozen times. We even took a whirlwind 4-day trip to Amsterdam together back in 2019---it was then I realized that we are not good travel companions.

I am a prepared one-bag traveler, whereas she texted me the morning of our flight to ask if she should bring a scarf because she had just started packing. She showed up to the airport without a wallet (she had loose cards in her pocket, I had a second wallet that I gave her which she still uses to this day) or wall adapter for her phone charger.

During the actual trip, we just didn't have compatible ""vacationing styles"". She was absolutely determined to find ""the best"" of everything and wanted to have a jampacked itinerary. Whereas I wanted to maybe have one or two things to check out each day and leave some room for spontaneity. The first day/night was rough for me with jetlag (I had to take one additional flight to meet her), but we hit the ground running. We finally got to our hotel room to sleep for the night and her snoring was AWFUL, like medically concerning levels of awful. She also talked in her sleep in full sentences, to the point where I actually thought she was awake and trying to ask me a question. I barely slept that first night and all subsequent nights were rough. I even mentioned to her over breakfast our first morning ""I need to get some earplugs at some point today because you snore really loudly"" and she said, ""I don't think I snore...?"" I assured her that she indeed does.

There was also a point in the trip where I realized she has a huge problem accepting that she is wrong, even with the most inconsequential things. IIRC, we were talking about a movie/show and I said, ""Oh I think so-and-so actor is in that"" and she said ""No, he's definitely not"". So, I looked it up on IMDB and said ""Yeah he was, look here"" and she just ignored me.

The trip ended and I had decided in my mind I didn't want to any big international excursions with her again. Did I express this at the time? No.

We still maintained contact/ the friendship and saw each other a decent amount (considering we live two states apart). When we visited each other, we each had our own sleeping quarters. In 2021 we took a short domestic trip with a couple other friends from university and overall, that went pretty well. We each had our own rooms and didn't accompany each other while we traveled to the destination. In 2022, our friends invited us to meet their newborn around the holidays. I booked a hotel room independently. She texted me the day before to ask if she could piggyback of my preparedness...because COVID was still a concern and it was the holidays, I obliged. It was a mistake. The snoring/sleep talking was still raging. I made a comment in the morning that I hadn't slept well because of the snoring and she just kinda shrugged it off and didn't say anything.

A few days ago, she sent me a link to a crazy good flight/hotel deal for a 6 day trip to Spain. I had a sinking feeling in my stomach. While it does sound incredible, I just can't bring myself to do it. I sent her a response a few hours later saying:

""I think we have very different travel styles/preferences that would make it hard to do a 6-day trip together and not get on each other‚Äôs nerves. And I love you, but I cannot share a hotel/bedroom with you. When we've shared before you've snored and talked in your sleep at a level that makes it hard for me to fall/stay asleep""

It has been over 5 days, and she hasn't responded to it, but has been active in a group chat we're both part of.¬† I did my best to be kind and express why I find it hard to travel with her and still spare her feelings. I understand she can't control her snoring, the only reason I brought it up was because the pricing tier she sent me was for a shared hotel room with twin beds. I know I'm not totally blameless, I could have been more direct a lot earlier than this. But the fact she's just letting my message hang there without any kind of acknowledgement is kind of upsetting, given we've known and supported each other in other capacities for 14 years. I'm not sure what to do at this point, or if I should just let it go and wash my hands of all of it.

12,1fpc2b7,AITA for refusing to pay for my niece‚Äôs wedding after promising to cover it?,"So, I'm a 35-year-old guy, and I‚Äôve always been close with my older sister, *Emily* (38F), and her daughter, *Lily* (22F). Emily had Lily when she was young (16), and since she was a single mom for most of it, I‚Äôve always tried to help out where I could. Over the years, I‚Äôve paid for Lily‚Äôs summer camps, her college applications, and even her first car. I did this because I love them both and always wanted to support them.

A year ago, Lily got engaged to her long-term boyfriend. When they announced the engagement at a family dinner, I said I‚Äôd be happy to help with wedding expenses. I never said I‚Äôd pay for *everything*, but apparently, my offer was interpreted as me footing the bill for the whole wedding. It became clear when Lily and Emily started planning a big, extravagant affair‚Äîdestination wedding, 200+ guests, you name it.

I sat them down and said I‚Äôd contribute $15,000, which I thought was a pretty generous amount. But they both seemed really upset. Lily said I ‚Äúpromised‚Äù to pay for the wedding, and Emily backed her up, saying I ‚Äúalways supported them‚Äù and this was the least I could do. Apparently, they were expecting I‚Äôd cover a $50,000+ wedding. I told them that wasn‚Äôt happening. $15,000 was all I could give.

Now, here‚Äôs where things get worse. Lily and Emily stopped including me in the wedding planning entirely. I didn‚Äôt hear much from them for a while, and it turns out they booked everything for the wedding thinking I‚Äôd *eventually* cave and cover it. Now they‚Äôre in over their heads, and the wedding is just three months away. Emily called me, crying, saying they were going to lose deposits and that I ‚Äúruined‚Äù the wedding by not coming through. Lily isn‚Äôt speaking to me.

Here‚Äôs the kicker: Emily and Lily are now saying I‚Äôm being manipulative, offering to help and then taking it away at the last second, making them look bad in front of the groom‚Äôs family. They claim they never would‚Äôve planned something so extravagant if I hadn‚Äôt promised to cover it all.

But I never said that. I said I‚Äôd *help*. I feel like I‚Äôve done more than enough over the years, but now I‚Äôm being treated like the villain for not paying for this giant wedding.

My fianc√©e, Sarah, and I have been planning this wedding for over a year, and we‚Äôre both excited. It‚Äôs going to be a relatively small event with close family and friends, very intimate. We‚Äôre having it at this beautiful outdoor venue with a lovely garden, something we‚Äôve dreamed of for a long time.

Here‚Äôs the issue: my sister-in-law, Emily, has this dog. And by ""this dog,"" I mean a tiny, yappy Pomeranian that she takes everywhere. I‚Äôm talking everywhere‚Äîfamily dinners, grocery shopping, you name it. Emily‚Äôs super attached to her dog, and she assumes that wherever she goes, the dog goes too. It‚Äôs basically like her emotional support animal, though not officially.

A couple of weeks ago, she casually mentioned that she couldn‚Äôt wait for the wedding and joked about what the dog would wear. I laughed, thinking she was kidding. Then it hit me: she wasn‚Äôt. She fully intends to bring her dog to our wedding.

I told her flat-out, ‚ÄúSorry, no dogs at the wedding.‚Äù Emily got really upset and told me that her dog is like family. She claimed it would be cruel to leave him behind for an entire day, and that she couldn‚Äôt enjoy the wedding if she was worrying about him the whole time. She even said, ""Well, you know dogs can sense love, right? What‚Äôs more loving than a wedding?""

Sarah and I talked about it, and we both agree that a wedding is not the place for a dog, especially one that barks at random and can be a bit of a handful. Not to mention, my aunt is allergic to dogs, and the venue has a strict no-pets policy. I explained all of this to Emily, but she insists that I‚Äôm being unreasonable and that everyone knows how much her dog means to her.

Now, my future mother-in-law is involved, and she‚Äôs siding with Emily, saying that ‚Äúfamily is family,‚Äù and I should just let her bring the dog to keep the peace. But Sarah‚Äôs standing by me, and we don‚Äôt want to compromise the atmosphere of our wedding for one guest‚Äôs dog.

15,1fpbpgn,AITA for supporting my sister after she decided not to invite our parents to her private gender reveal announcement?,"My (18F) sister (33F) is currently 3 months into her pregnancy. She was very secretive about the entire thing and didn‚Äôt tell anybody in her life about it until a few weeks ago. Last week, my sister got the results for her baby‚Äôs gender in the mail. She told my mother about receiving the results and how she hadn‚Äôt opened it yet and my mother began to flood her with questions about if she was going to do a gender reveal party, if she could help out with the gender reveal party, how she should come to our house to talk about the baby, etc. My sister brushed a lot of it off by saying she simply didn‚Äôt know what she wanted to do yet. 

Well, this week, my sister added everyone in our immediate family to a WhatsApp group chat. She said nothing, just sent a video of her and her fianc√© popping small party poppers as a gender reveal celebration. There was no crowd‚Äî no friends, no family‚Äî just them and a cameraman to document the entire thing. They had decided on doing a private gender reveal just for the two of them. 

My mom was absolutely livid upon seeing the video. She instantly stormed downstairs to talk (see: yell) to my father about how my sister was a snake who didn‚Äôt see the value in family, how she couldn‚Äôt believe that her own daughter would betray her like this, how she was a horrible role model to her younger siblings, etc. My dad echoed her sentiments. They are furious that my sister decided that she wanted a private moment to celebrate HER pregnancy that didn‚Äôt involve anybody else except HERSELF. They called her selfish for it. They said she was going down the wrong path with this pregnancy all because she didn‚Äôt want the moment to be about anybody other than herself. They sent her a very long, nasty message about how they felt about her gender reveal celebration not involving them.

Now, this is where I may be the asshole, but I truly do not see the issue with any of my sister‚Äôs actions. She has had a pretty tough relationship with my parents in recent years due to them wanting to exert a lot of control over her when she was well into her twenties, and her relationship with our mother is EXTRA strained because she feels our mother is a very self-centered, egotistical, manipulative woman that can‚Äôt handle criticism well. I can completely understand why my sister feels the way she does and why she wanted a private gender reveal party. I sympathize with her wanting to keep it between her and her fianc√©, and I let her know that.

I‚Äôm super lost on how to feel about everything. I don‚Äôt want my sister to feel like everyone in our family is against her because of how harsh my family is being, but at the same time, I‚Äôm still young and don‚Äôt know everything.

It was a complete surprise, and it meant the world to me since I‚Äôd been feeling lonely with everyone starting Uni/college.

What I didn‚Äôt realize was there had been some drama in planning it. Two friends were unclear about coming, showing up briefly to say hi and drop a gift before leaving. I noticed some of my other friends giving them looks, but I brushed it off. Later, in the Discord server they used for planning (which they invited me to share pictures), I saw one of them getting defensive about why they couldn‚Äôt stay.

My best friend, who planned it all, was still understandably annoyed at how they couldn't take things seriously and almost spoiled it. She was stressed the entire time, thinking the surprise would get ruined because the two friends didn‚Äôt cooperate. She also didn't feel like her perspective wasn't shared enough or supportive because everyone seemed to move on so quickly before she could have a say

It‚Äôs been a few days, and while most all the others agreed to apologize and have moved on, but she‚Äôs still mad. I told her it wasn‚Äôt worth fussing over since the situation seemed small, and the two guys would probably realize they messed up later.

I told her that most often than not we don't get a proper response or conclusion to arguments (at least not right away) and it happens, that its better to cool off on both sides and she should drop it since the surprise wasn't ruined and I have a fun time anyways.

We have been messaging back and forth and now she's giving me the silent treatment and I feel like a shitty friend for not backing her up on this enough especially when she put in all that effort for me, now I feel like I basically told her to get over it and her opinion doesn't matter

My daughters school only starts at 9:00 am and our school is nearby so she usually gets up by 7:30-7:45.

I get it but my niece has to get up early and it's important for her to get good sleep as she's under a lot of pressure in school right now. So I just told her no and to just adjust for a bit.

My daughter got really angry and said I'm prioritizing her and that I'm spoiling my niece and i shouldn't be depriving her of video games.

I told her she can play before and has plenty of time but she refuses to budge and she's now upset.

21,1fpadnn,AITA for arguing with my friend that her sports team also has good/bad fans like its rival and then not talking with her since?,"Edit: I certainly didn't go to work desiring to fight about her sports team. What started as a conversation suddenly went into her accusations of team 2 being ""the worst"". I wanted a middle ground but her crazy insistence about an over-generalization was what frustrated me. I didn't bring up my family/friends--just used as my experience. 

I have worked with my friend at this company for 6 years. (Her dad is the boss but I‚Äôve never noticed any favoritism, he‚Äôs a great boss and all employees like him). We would hang out outside the office often and then would help each of with our similar responsibilities.
Tuesday is our only in-office work day and Boss has encouraged us to chat/socialize in addition to our work. 
My friend is 100% all about her sports teams. She went to a University with the best football team in the state and that team (team 1) has a huge rivalry with another team (team 2) in the state. It‚Äôs a big deal. 
Now, I could care less about sports and rivalries. But my family has always supported team 1 since it‚Äôs my father‚Äôs Alma mater. 

The issue comes when she says that team 2 has ‚Äúthe worst fans of all time‚Äù.
I have many extended family members and friends who went to the school of team 2 and they‚Äôre nice and respectful. I‚Äôve been to games at both schools and enjoyed it.
But she was absolutely adamant that team 2 has the worst fans.
So, wanting to bring a middle ground I said: well, team 1 has great fans and I‚Äôm sure they have bad fans too. And team 2 has good/bad fans just the same.
She wasn‚Äôt having it because this one time there was a family (fans of team 2) who didn‚Äôt like that she was a fan of team 1.
This ridiculous, over-generalized, and completely subjective assumption, argued as a statement of fact, started to really frustrate me. 

In the end, I said that she really pissed me off and I haven‚Äôt talked with her since. 
Now, I get that I have a passive/aggressive issue. I had been depressed the month before and hadn‚Äôt been talking much at all which she seemed to only think was directed at her so she wouldn‚Äôt talk to me or include me. It wasn‚Äôt directed at her. I didn‚Äôt chat with anyone. But I had to apologize to her in order for her to talk to me again.
So come to this experience, she doesn‚Äôt talk to me but chats all the time with everyone else. I will talk with someone if they instigate a conversation but she ignores me while chatting with everyone else. So now I look like a jerk and she‚Äôs the happy friendly one.
She also won‚Äôt communicate with me on work and I know that she has taken a few of my projects and though it‚Äôs not a huge deal because of how our jobs work it still bothers me. 

I have a strong feeling she will never apologize or even just talk with me unless I apologize for disrespecting her team. And that really frustrates me because I don‚Äôt think I was wrong in saying that both team 1 & team 2 have both good and bad fans.

What should I do?

It is at an Apple Orchard about 45 minutes from our house and she plans on taking our one year old Daughter with her as she commonly does for these events.

Of course I want to spend time with them but I figured I have four days off, they can go do the Craft Fair Saturday and Sunday, I'll drop them off, help them unload, then go home to relax and then Monday and Tuesday I'm all theirs. That is until last night when my Wife asked me if since I have had so little time with them lately if I would stay and hang out with them at the Craft Fair.

I tried to explain that it's not that I don't want to spend time with them because I do, I'm just exhausted and needed some down time. She tried to say it wasn't like we'd be walking all around the orchard, we'd be sitting behind a table but to me that's still being out and surrounded by people which isn't restful. 



I really stressed to her that aside from an hour I had to take care of a work thing Monday I was all theirs Monday and Tuesday and couldn't wait to spend the day with them but by the end of our short conversation it was clear she felt like I'd rather lay about at home watching tv and playing video games then spend time with them even if she didn't say it.

23,1fp9vbc,AITA for arguing with my best friend after she said i can‚Äôt get a cat in our apartment? ,"
I (F20) am soon to be living with my roommate and best friend (F20) in our apartment. I have already lived here for about a week and she moves in next week. I have recently moved out of my parents house due to some deep issues and have decided to go NC for a while. I come from a big family, so it‚Äôs a huge change. I have been mentioning to her that i have wanted a cat for a while and when we began talks of moving in i constantly talked about it and she just said if i get one it‚Äôs mine and mine only. I didn‚Äôt see an issue. Do keep in mind that she previously had a cat who ran away, and she loved him dearly.

Now i‚Äôve moved in, i‚Äôve told her that i‚Äôm most likely going to get one, and now she‚Äôs saying that she will move out if i do, and that she never wants to see it. It made me feel really weird, considering when she had a cat i made myself very comfortable around him, and even pet sit him multiple times. I kept reminding her that she doesn‚Äôt have to deal with my cat, ever look after him/her and she will stay in my side of the apartment, but she is still annoyed. I mentioned that she loves going home (hence why she‚Äôs waiting until the very last moment to move in) and she won‚Äôt be here for christmas and a few months next year, so i want to have a little company whilst i live here. I understand if she is still hurt about her cat running away, however i don‚Äôt feel like i should have to suffer and never get a cat because of this. I also am hurt she threatened to move out because she constantly talks about moving out and she hasn‚Äôt even moved in yet. I have done everything i can to make her move in smooth, i even found this place for us and i can‚Äôt even have one thing i want, in order to pander for her emotions. 

I honestly am really upset and i told her i don‚Äôt want to talk about this anymore. I don‚Äôt plan on getting the cat anymore because i know it will cause tensions, however i still really want one. I hate being alone and love having things to look after and love.

26,1fp8xo9,WIBTA for asking my husband to disable his location sharing with his parents?,"Will provide some context to this story. My husband is 28 years old, I'm 27. We've been married 2 years and together over 7. I've known that his parents, two brothers, and himself all share each others locations on Find My Friends. They have had this setting on since they were minors and use it actively.

My husband doesn't share his location with anyone else, and he and I have never used that setting before. Its none of my business what he does with his live location and if he shares it with family, but something happened recently that made me quite uncomfortable.

He and I had a long weekend away planned together in Maine. He mentioned to his parents a week or so ago that we had plans to go to Maine and stay near Portland. While we are driving into Portland we get a *surprise* call from my husband's parents saying that they wanted to surprise us but they were ""not far"" from Portland and figured we could meet up. They don't live anywhere near us so the odds of them being in Maine as well was really a one in a million sort of situation. Turns out they were going to be in Boston for the weekend (we weren't aware of this) and were inspired when we mentioned Maine and wanted to see it for themselves.

So they call and say ""surprise! we're here too!"" My husband offered that we could maybe see each other after dinner or find a way to say hello. His parents seemed amendable to meeting for a nightcap.

Turns out that they then used his location tracker to surprise us as we were driving to our dinner reservation. My husband was startled but still happy to see his parents so they just joined us in the end.

I found it very unsettling that they used the location tracker to find us and then surprise us outside of the restaurant we were going to. The only way they'd have been able to do that is if they were watching our location live and were very close by to us. My husband didn't think to open the app and check where his parents were because we'd agreed on meeting at our hotel for a nightcap later in the evening. The deduction is they must have been *very* close by and also timed it that they were nearby enough that they'd be the first ones. We didn't tell them which restaurant we were going to and had booked reservations a while in advance.

I'm very much thinking of asking my husband to disable this setting or have a stern talk with his parents about boundaries pertaining to ""surprises"" like this. I appreciate surprises but this feels like an invasion of privacy. I don't want to be controlling though and ultimately it is *his* location / location tracker so it isn't up to me. Would I be the AH if I ask him to do it? I think this level of monitoring is controlling and honestly hinges on stalkery behavior (though I want to be cautious using this term) This isn't the first time they've ""surprised us"" by showing up unannoucned - though in the past it hasn't been this eggregious. I know that him turning it off would likely cause confusion in his family

Something else is that I do worry this behavior is a little stalkery but Idk if that's something I can / should bring up to my husband as it would likely hurt his feelings. His folks are well-meaning and kind people otherwise but they definitely don't mind ""surprising"" us like this

edit: the issue is I anticipate very strongly that his parents/family would pushback if he just stopped sharing his location/told them they couldn't do this. Husband has hinted that his family ""really enjoys"" these sorts of impromptu things and its very normal for people to join dinners / be added kind of like this left and right. So I know that this would cause trouble if he did... thats why I'm wondering if its an AH move for me to pretty much instigate drama.

Turns out they were going to be in Boston for the weekend (we weren't aware of this) and were inspired when we mentioned Maine and wanted to see it for themselves.

So they call and say ""surprise! we're here too!"" My husband offered that we could maybe see each other after dinner or find a way to say hello. His parents seemed amendable to meeting for a nightcap.

Turns out that they then used his location tracker to surprise us as we were driving to our dinner reservation. My husband was startled but still happy to see his parents so they just joined us in the end.

I found it very unsettling that they used the location tracker to find us and then surprise us outside of the restaurant we were going to. The only way they'd have been able to do that is if they were watching our location live and were very close by to us. My husband didn't think to open the app and check where his parents were because we'd agreed on meeting at our hotel for a nightcap later in the evening. The deduction is they must have been *very* close by and also timed it that they were nearby enough that they'd be the first ones. We didn't tell them which restaurant we were going to and had booked reservations a while in advance.

I'm very much thinking of asking my husband to disable this setting or have a stern talk with his parents about boundaries pertaining to ""surprises"" like this. I appreciate surprises but this feels like an invasion of privacy. I don't want to be controlling though and ultimately it is *his* location / location tracker so it isn't up to me. Would I be the AH if I ask him to do it? I think this level of monitoring is controlling and honestly hinges on stalkery behavior (though I want to be cautious using this term) This isn't the first time they've ""surprised us"" by showing up unannoucned - though in the past it hasn't been this eggregious. I know that him turning it off would likely cause confusion in his family

Something else is that I do worry this behavior is a little stalkery but Idk if that's something I can / should bring up to my husband as it would likely hurt his feelings. His folks are well-meaning and kind people otherwise but they definitely don't mind ""surprising"" us like this

edit: the issue is I anticipate very strongly that his parents/family would pushback if he just stopped sharing his location/told them they couldn't do this. Husband has hinted that his family ""really enjoys"" these sorts of impromptu things and its very normal for people to join dinners / be added kind of like this left and right. So I know that this would cause trouble if he did... thats why I'm wondering if its an AH move for me to pretty much instigate drama. ",0.0,0.9772376418113708,1,0
27,1fp8p4r,AITA for chewing out a drone guy?,"Yesterday my husband and I were in our fenced backyard prepping to paint our house when a drone buzzed overhead. Fucking HATE drones but sometimes they fly by, whatever. This one, however, stopped about 20 feet directly over our house and hovered for a minute or two before zipping off. 

I pointed it out and wondered who in our remote rural neighborhood had one and why would they be taking pix of us. He thought it might be the underwriter for our new insurance company so we went out the gate to see. There was a dude parked on the street, clearly operating it.

DH called out to the guy, asking if he was insurance. The guy just turned his back to us. So I i hollered (still a distance away) asking who he was. He finally answered that he was taking pix for a real estate listing. I informed him, not particularly kindly, that this was my house and it wasn't being listed. He then pointed at our neighbors' house. But that didn't explain why he was hovering over our house, and when I said so he replied with ""Incorrect!"" and ""Wrong!"" I demanded to see the footage because I quite literally watched him fly it over our house but ofc he wouldn't show it to us. 

It ended with him saying he didn't see what the problem was and us pointing out the people don't like it when strange men fly drones over their fenced backyards, where they had a reasonable expectation of privacy. 

In the moment I was too heated to, well, think, and as we stomped back to our house, it became clear that he was over our house to get an aerial shot of the neighbor's house. So why didn't he just say that, instead of calling me a liar and saying he never flew the drone over our house?That in itself is sketch to me. 

No threats were made, no cops were called, but we felt pretty justified in our pissed offness, especially his lying and gaslighting me about it. Our neighbor otoh texted and said we were lunatics for confronting the guy and that it was no big deal. I asked him how he'd feel if some strange man flew a drone over his house while his kids were outside. He refused to answer that and just kept implying we were out of line. So Reddit, were we?

For a few weeks she had such a hard time coping with the fact she was expecting our first child after losing her dad, and the fact he would never get to meet his grandkids or live to be a living, breathing grandfather. She ended up seeking therapy because it was a struggle for her to get back on track. I was doing everything I could to support her.

In that time MIL was around a lot. My wife was their only child so MIL leaned on her and sought out the comfort of having family. They grew closer than ever before and slowly MIL started spending less time with us. But she'd still stop by and they wanted MIL to be there for a 3d/4d ultrasound my wife was booked in for. I was also there, of course.

On the day of MIL showed up with a man and introduced him as her boyfriend. She said she wanted to include him in such a special moment. My wife said he was not coming into the room with us and they argued before my wife told MIL to leave.

MIL and my wife fought more afterward because my wife didn't say hi or anything to MILs boyfriend. And because MIL felt my wife should have been more open to including him.

Then my wife left the room and went to cry. She wanted some space so I gave it to her and told MIL she needed to leave.

Josie's different from Jane. She's got this proper creative vibe like she's always thinking about something deeper.

34,1fp6y7h,WIBTA if I uninvited my sister to my wedding?,"Throwaway account.

I (28F) got engaged to my fianc√© (35M) three months ago. Since then, we've started planning our wedding but as it's only been a couple of months, we haven't gotten too far into the process. So far, we've decided to get legally married in my hometown (where we don't live) and a couple weeks later, have an intimate symbolic wedding abroad. We want to get married in September 2025 but would settle on sometime in 2026 if availability for the venue we end up moving forward with requires more notice. As of late, we‚Äôve been contacting venues, but this is a work in progress due to some language barriers and being in different time zones. 

Anyway, my fianc√© and I have decided to rent a villa that we will get married at but it has to have space to accommodate both of our immediate families for a week. We decided to do this because we want to 1. ensure our families have fewer costs to attend and 2. extend our wedding celebrations to be longer than a single day since we'll be abroad. 

A month ago, I sent a message to my immediate family to let them know this was what we wanted (September 2025, legally get married back at home, wedding abroad, villa rental, etc) and asked if they were available and on board with coming. Everybody was thrilled. Including all of my siblings partners. 

This past weekend, my fianc√© and I hosted an engagement celebration party and while there, my sister‚Äôs (30F, my MOH) boyfriend (33M) started talking to me about how he's planning to get a ring to propose. He expressed that 'all of his friends are starting to get married so it's about that time and he's been with my sister for so long that he should do it'. I shared the nicer parts of this conversation with my sister and since then, I guess she's decided to start planning her wedding before he even proposes. 

She texted me yesterday to let me know that the two of them love September 2025 for their wedding. She went on further to say that she would like to get married just before me, and use my wedding abroad as the start of her honeymoon.

I‚Äôm beyond disappointed and upset with her. I‚Äôm really struggling to come to terms with the fact that she would even consider this because it makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt view me with the same regard or respect that I view her.

When I told her this wasn‚Äôt exciting news for me and asked for time to process, she told me I was overthinking it and getting upset over nothing. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Im stressed enough planning the wedding without having to explain to her how she‚Äôs being inconsiderate of me. And tbh, I don‚Äôt really feel like I should have to explain that. 

WIBTA if I decided I didn‚Äôt want her to come anymore? ",TL;DR,2024-09-25,"WIBTA if I uninvited my sister to my wedding? Throwaway account.

I (28F) got engaged to my fianc√© (35M) three months ago. Since then, we've started planning our wedding but as it's only been a couple of months, we haven't gotten too far into the process. So far, we've decided to get legally married in my hometown (where we don't live) and a couple weeks later, have an intimate symbolic wedding abroad. We want to get married in September 2025 but would settle on sometime in 2026 if availability for the venue we end up moving forward with requires more notice. As of late, we‚Äôve been contacting venues, but this is a work in progress due to some language barriers and being in different time zones. 

Anyway, my fianc√© and I have decided to rent a villa that we will get married at but it has to have space to accommodate both of our immediate families for a week. We decided to do this because we want to 1. ensure our families have fewer costs to attend and 2. extend our wedding celebrations to be longer than a single day since we'll be abroad. 

A month ago, I sent a message to my immediate family to let them know this was what we wanted (September 2025, legally get married back at home, wedding abroad, villa rental, etc) and asked if they were available and on board with coming. Everybody was thrilled. Including all of my siblings partners. 

This past weekend, my fianc√© and I hosted an engagement celebration party and while there, my sister‚Äôs (30F, my MOH) boyfriend (33M) started talking to me about how he's planning to get a ring to propose. He expressed that 'all of his friends are starting to get married so it's about that time and he's been with my sister for so long that he should do it'. I shared the nicer parts of this conversation with my sister and since then, I guess she's decided to start planning her wedding before he even proposes. 

She texted me yesterday to let me know that the two of them love September 2025 for their wedding. She went on further to say that she would like to get married just before me, and use my wedding abroad as the start of her honeymoon.

I‚Äôm beyond disappointed and upset with her. I‚Äôm really struggling to come to terms with the fact that she would even consider this because it makes me feel like she doesn‚Äôt view me with the same regard or respect that I view her. I‚Äôm not even sure how the logistics of what she‚Äôs suggesting would work given the time contraints involved with my legal marriage & then my wedding abroad.

35,1fp6xvm,WIBTA if I told my mom I can‚Äôt take care of grandma anymore?,"My (25F) grandma (87F) started living with us full time. Now it wouldn‚Äôt be a big deal normally, but within the last year grandma has developed pretty severe dementia and mobility problems. She doesn‚Äôt know who we are most of the time (on top of several other issues), and she‚Äôs pretty much chained to a walker/cane. Sometimes she can‚Äôt even walk. I want to spare some of the details but she needs 24/7 care basically.

36,1fp6tob,AITA for Yelling at My Husband's Cousin to Take Care of Her Dad Instead of Expecting Us to Do It?,"My mother-in-law Ann (77) and her brother Jim (80) have lived together in Ann's house for about 12 years. He is broke and has no lease/rent; she is sole owner and still pays the mortgage. Jim‚Äôs daughter Sue (60) lives 5 hours away and is a retired healthcare worker. My husband and I live 45 minutes away, work full time, and visit 1-3 times a week. 1-2 years ago, Jim and Ann's health started to deteriorate. Jim falls frequently, can‚Äôt prepare food or walk more than 20 feet at a time, and can‚Äôt hear. He has backed his car into the closed garage door and left the gas stove on multiple times. He struggles with the stairs to his bedroom (pulled out the banister twice) and breaks things.

Jim has asked us to help him with a plan because being in the house is too hard. For months, we‚Äôve asked Sue to find a safe place for him to go eventually. Sue visits twice a year, stays with us, and sees Jim a total of three days per year. She says things are fine and when Jim gets hurt/sick, Medicaid will ‚Äúput him someplace.‚Äù In June, Jim was hospitalized for two weeks. Sue didn't come because she had an adults-only Disney trip. (She goes 3-6 times per year.) We picked up the slack, Jim was discharged, and things resumed.

Now, Ann has a health crisis. Sue stayed with Jim because we needed help. I‚Äôm the point person for Sue and other family members, because it‚Äôs too much for my husband while he‚Äôs at the hospital with his mom.

She said she didn‚Äôt want to and didn‚Äôt know how, so I suggested he move in with her temporarily. We can‚Äôt care for both of them anymore because of the time, cost, and level of care.

Here's what happened, so I was in internship when this all happened. One day while I was coming back to my home from internship(Friday) when my best friend no 1 called and told me that she was coming to my city tomorrow and will be staying for a day or 2.

I was very happy, then the day when she was coming came (Saturday) and j called her and she said, unfortunately she won't be able to make it and she was going on a tour with my best friend no 2 that day for 3-4 days. 

(I knew about this tour, and because my best friends boyfriends where also going I declined the tour offer) so I was like okay cool and I made plans with my university friends for Saturday and Sunday.

Then after about 7-8 hours, best friend no 2 called and said, babe can you like let best friend no 1 stay with you in your flat. I am very sick and I won't be able to attend the tour, and now she is coming and I can't even attend her. And I was like yeah yeah sure I'll just cancel my plans.

And she goes like yeah and please can you like let her stay and go out with her. I was like yeah no problem and then she was like it would be awesome if you skipped your internship on monday too as she will be staying on that day tooo.

I thought she is asking too much but I was like she Is sick so I should help her. Then my best friend no 1 called me and we were talking when she revealed the truth to me that my best friend no 2 was going on a couple tour with her boyfriend so that's why she won't be able to attend her.

I was heart broken, so I after an hour or two decided to cancel all plans with my 'best friends' and have fun with University friends. Due to which they are not talking with me.

46,1fp1vnt,"AITA for ""playing favorites"" and excluding my son from our girls night?","I (41f) have two children, Layla (17f) and Jacob (15m). I want to clarify that I love them both equally and have always tried to make sure that none of my children felt like I had a favorite child. 

My husband (43m) on the other hand very clearly prefers our son. He was very happy to have a daughter, and a really great dad to her, but it's clear that he gets along with Jacob more, mainly because they're both boys and enjoy the same things. They both love football and baseball, and often go see a match together, or spend weekend playing, or talk about it together etc. This became more important when Jacob got older and started getting into sports more. I get that it's easier for my husband to talk to our son about things they both love, but it's been making me sad to see our daughter excluded from their conversations or activities together. 

My husband doesn't do a lot of things with Layla. They sometimes watch movies together, but most of the time it's either my husband and Jacob doing something just the two of them, or the four of us together. For that reason, I recently decided to start doing things with my daughter, just the two of us. These past 2-3 months we've gone to the movies, to the mall, had girls night, went to a bowling alley and many more things. I can see that it makes my daughter happy, so I thought it was a great thing. 

My husband never complained about it, mainly because we mostly did this when the boys were doing something together. A week ago there was an open air projection of Tangled, which has been Layla's favorite movie since she was maybe 6 or 7, and I had planned on going for weeks. The problem is, my husband found out 4 days prior that he had to go away for work that same night. He asked me to stay home and said that we could just watch another movie together the three of us. I said no because this night was important to me and my daughter, and our son also said that he was completely fine staying home alone, and would play video games with his friends. My husband didn't say anything but I could tell it bothered him. 

When he came back from his work trip, he got really mad at me and told me he ""didn't believe we actually went and excluded Jacob"" and that I was ""playing favorites"" because I decided to have a night with only Layla.

In fact, when I messaged her asking which restaurant she recommended, she simply said 'it's somewhere in town' When I asked specifically for name of restaurant so I can book, she got annoyed, saying 'it's in town, who cares, we'll decide what to do when we get there'.



She said she's busy with uni and bf. We went back and forth through text(she refuses to call me to discuss), and I admittedly escalated the argument, using some hurtful swearing, saying she doesn't give a f\*ck about anyone & can go f\*ck herself.

My sister messaged me saying we need to talk about our relationship, and to tell friends to wait an hour for us to talk.

She said I either give her my time to have a serious talk, or she's not coming, and I can find another place to stay the weekend. I felt really hurt here & told her I won't submit to an emotional threat like that and I'll find a place to stay. The next day, I didn't have time to talk, she didn't show up for restaurant, but on the way back to my friends house, I offered to wake up at 6am and meet her for a one-to-one before my flight, i wanted to salvage our relationship.



We met at 7am, she brought her bf, which is annoying since he isn't involved. We start talking, she said I don't acknowledge her emotional vulnerability, and keep disregarding her feelings, this will be the end of our relationship.

I (31M) and my wife (26F) have been married for 3 years and have a boy who is 2 years.
She is kind and generous and i love her very much and she loves me too.  
We both work from 9-5 and our son is taken care of by a nanny. We both make good money. Since my wife is working i dint want to burden her and I hired a cook who does all the cooking. My wife doesn't like doing household chores and is very messy. I clean up the house and do all the chores myself with little help from her. But i do it nevertheless because i like a neat house.

The other day she asked me to help her with some office work she had to do and i said okay. I got busy with the household chores and had to go to the market for some stuff. I thought i would help her after completing the chores and putting our son to bed. By the time i had finished up it was a little late. When i went up to her and tried to help her she pushed me away saying it was too late and i should have started helping her out earlier. She said i dint care for her and i did not prioritise helping her and instead  chose to do household chores. She dint let me help her and did it all by herself staying up late.

51,1fp0jf4,AITA for making an insensitive comment and suggesting therapy to my family?,"When I (16f) was a baby my dad died. I have three older siblings (all in their 20s now) and a half brother who was my dad's son from a different relationship. After dad died his ex moved with their son and we never saw him. I don't remember him. My siblings all remember and miss him and so does mom. Mom tried to fight for our rights to see him through the courts when dad's ex wouldn't agree but she apparently never wanted him to be a part of our family so she said no and the courts didn't grand visitation rights to us for sibling visits. This really upset my mom and siblings and for years I've heard about my half brother and seen videos and photos of them and how happy they used to be. When he would have turned 18 mom tried to find him on social media but couldn't and she had no other contact info for him so she waited and hoped he'd reach out.

That didn't happen and my siblings all tried finding him on social media and eventually they decided to do Ancestry or something to find him, but he wasn't there. Then he asked social media to help them find him. And eventually they found an account from him and they rushed to friend him and DM him but he never replied. They looked a while after and he had made his account private and never replied to them. They saw the message they sent had been seen. So they know he was aware they reached out.

Last week my siblings and mom were talking about what they should do next and how could they make contact to make sure he's aware they want him back in our lives. This is when I spoke up and said it's pretty clear he doesn't want to have us in his life. I said he saw the message, he made his one account private and didn't accept their requests so it sends a pretty clear message. They asked why I was being so insensitive and that they're trying to reunite after being apart for too long. They brought up how close they were before and how if his mom hadn't taken him away we'd still be close. I said if his mom was that unhappy with us being in his life that she might have kept saying negative stuff to him after they left and so now he doesn't want to know us. I said maybe therapy could help them because he might not like if they keep pushing.

They told me I sounded like I had a problem with them loving and missing him and wanting him back and was trying to therapy the wish away. Mom said my grandparents (her parents) really missed him too and might not be around forever so finding him and reuniting is important. They've been off since around me.

Edit: Forgot to add that a third party firm will be the one that would manage the estate and wellbeing of my brother. My wife has the option to take part if she does desire but overall even if she does take part I did make it clear the objective would be to keep my brother engaged and part a community for as long as humanly possible. Their fee's will be drawn from the estate at a set rate, and I trust them completely. So overall she can have input but final say does not fall in lines with her. Also in the event when my brother does pass the order it will fall to is my wife if she is no longer alive then it goes to my children.

So I have been married for 22 years, unfortunately I was recently diagnosed with cancer, we caught it early and my prognosis is good, but you never know so I am getting things in order just in case. Now my wife and I have two beautiful children, and I have made sure they will be well taken care of. They have a decent amount saved for college, we a well funded savings, and both my wife and I have well paying careers.

My younger brother is non verbal on the spectrum. I have been supporting him since I started to work, and being as our parents are gone--covid and breast cancer--I am all he has. My logic is as follows my wife has a stable career that makes good money, and she has everything we amassed together such as the house, my retirement plan and stuff.

One of my hobbies is real-estate so I do own a modest amount of property and rental units. I wish to leave all of that in a trust with my younger brother as the sole beneficiary, I also wish to leave him my portfolio. With all of that he will be well taken care of. My wife is not exactly pleased with this idea. I have done my best to explain my reasoning, and told her God forbid if anything where to happen to me I want all the people I love to be well taken care of.

Yes, in the grand scheme my brother will make out better in terms of monthly income, but my wife and kids 100% will be getting my life insurance policy which is not a small amount either, enough for her in theory to live very comfortably while also giving a large sum to each of our children.

So am I the asshole in this case? My wife said some harsh things, which got me thinking not sure if she meant them or not given the possibility of the situation but yeah.

Last year during the same holidays, I invited M and our mutual friend P (16F) away with me and we had the best time. I was allowed to invite both friends at the same time because we had room and the space to accommodate both of them. 

This time round, some of my parents friends and my brother (20M) are also coming down at the same time as M and I so we don‚Äôt have the room to accommodate P

M has messaged me asking if P can come as well. I replied with unfortunately no i dont think we have the room. 

This is where i might be the asshole, I struggle with social cues so i dont know when people are jealous of me. Today M and I were talking about going away and that we were very excited and P was there but talking to another person so they probably overheard the entire conversation. I don‚Äôt have any classes with M or P so i didn‚Äôt see them very much today. 

Another thing is that when someone says I made them sad or something similar, it affects and i over think it because i have an issue where i think everything is my fault even if it's not. I need strangers to tell me that i am not the asshole and just overthinking this like normal.

She knew her husband for almost 3 years before marrying him and I met him and his kids two months before they got married. From the time they moved in with us (day before they got married) my mom has changed and has neglected to give me 1:1 time. Whenever we plan anything now she brings her stepkids (10, 8 and 7). She's always trying to force me to join her and them for grocery shopping or ""fun shopping dates"". We already have time we spend all together; family dinners at the table each night, family movie nights, family days out. But she insists on including them even when I have asked or told her I wanted it to be just us. Sometimes she'll agree to it being just us and then gets them ready to come with us and acts like it's oh so great and exciting.

I have tried three different times to advocate for us to have 1:1 time. She'll take her stepkids out just them. They get 1:1 time with their dad and 3:1 time as their sibling group. But I can't get the 1:1 time with my mom. I pointed this out and she told me how much they love spending time with us and how they want to spend more time with me because they look up to me. I asked her about what I want and what I'd love. She told me I can't say I don't enjoy the time we spend with them and I said I can say that because it's true. I said occasionally is fine.

I told her she doesn't get to say no. That I am sick and tired of her including them in everything. That I am sick of her prioritizing their feelings and their wants over mine. I told her I am done. That she doesn't need to try including me anymore. And I'm not going to let her ruin more of my time with this shit. Her stepkids heard everything.

On top of all this he's jobless. he doesn't earn and recently spent all his savings. I'm not asking my sister to date a rich guy and become a gold digger but man come on. She has her own needs.

I have 8 periods total every two days of school that alternate each time. All of those periods are filled with classes, I have no study halls. I also am in all advanced classes because academics is a big thing for me and I try to do well. 

The other thing is when I was young, I moved a lot! Eventually, around 4ish years ago I ended up in Maine, where I currently live. The week after we moved my dad set me up for this after school program thing that the community had. It was a positive youth development program and I really liked it. Everything was going well. I was getting more and more into it and school was going ok until about a month ago. 

School was starting back up and I got really busy, really fast.

It's our first home on our own. My mom came over to visit and we started discussing our plans for Christmas, as usually we try to get her side and my dads side of the family together. We talked about doing Christmas at my place this year since I will have a 6 month old who will likely be mobile by that time and it would be easier to have an already baby-proofed house.

It was at this point she asked me if her boyfriend could come. I was hesitant because even though they have been together for about 3.5 years, she's told me before they have a casual relationship, they are not exclusive. In the past he has made family gatherings awkward especially when my dad is there. I also feel like when he's there I don't get any time with my mom.

So I told her no I don't want him to come, but she started getting upset and arguing with me saying I don't understand their relationship. She also said I don't see him as a human since he doesn't celebrate Christmas with his family and would just be alone and because of me he would be alone on Christmas day.

I told her she could always come another day around or come by herself at a different time if she wanted to spend some time with him before or after coming to my place. But at the end I just told her she would have to choose and decide who she wanted to be with for Christmas day. 

After that she said no one accepts her in her family and no one understands her polyamorous relationship. I told her I don't mind her doing what she does, it's not my business. At the same time I don't agree with it and it does make things awkward at family events especially when my dad and his family are around.

63,1foyz4p,AITA for selling on a gift from my mum?,"I (24f) meet up every Sunday afternoon for dinner with my brother (20M) and mum (52f). A few weeks ago, she brought her partner (29M (yes, the age gap is weird and uncomfortable)). The two of them had spent the afternoon charity shopping, and mum said she‚Äôd brought me a gift. I was really grateful, and excited to see what she‚Äôd gotten me.

When she revealed a kids Harry Potter backpack, I put on the best ‚Äúit‚Äôs so cute, thank you!‚Äù That I could and the conversation moved on.

Over lockdown, I had a big Harry Potter phase, like a lot of young adults, but quickly grew back out of it. I haven‚Äôt watched or even talked about the movies in well over 2 years. Not only that, but the backpack was for Gryffindor, and when I was super into it, I was a Slyrherin. 

When I got home, I talked about it with my partner (23f) and decided to quietly list it on Vinted, because I need the money more than the bag. I don‚Äôt have the space for extra clutter as I‚Äôm now moving into my partners house. I felt guilty at the idea of trying to make a profit from it, so I only listed it for ¬£2.50, as I figured that would be around what she paid for it in a charity shop.

A couple of weeks later, I‚Äôm showing mum something on my phone, and she sees the bag listed on Vinted. All hell breaks loose. ‚ÄúI got that as a gift for you! How could you get rid of it? Did you even use it? How much are you selling it for? I should have just kept it.‚Äù

And I understand why she‚Äôs upset. I tried to reassure her that I was grateful she thought of me and wanted to get me a gift, but that it wasn‚Äôt really suited to me. She said she was really upset that her daughter could do that. She spent my whole life playing the victim and when she said that I got really annoyed, and I said I was upset that she didn‚Äôt even know what house I was in. I said that she didn‚Äôt know me well at all.

She said she thought I‚Äôd like it anyway because it‚Äôs Harry Potter. She‚Äôs heard me absolutely rant about how much I hate JK Rowling, she knows the shows and movies that I am currently into that would make better gifts. And again, this was a kids backpack. I‚Äôm 24.

She said she thought I‚Äôd like it anyway because it‚Äôs Harry Potter. She‚Äôs heard me absolutely rant about how much I hate JK Rowling, she knows the shows and movies that I am currently into that would make better gifts. And again, this was a kids backpack. I‚Äôm 24.

I really, truly appreciate that my mum wanted to get me a gift, and I know that she did it with the best intentions, but AITA for trying to sell it? 

It should also be noted that I have social issues related to ASD and I don‚Äôt always know the best way to react to a situation. If there‚Äôs something I should have done differently when she first gave it to me, I‚Äôd really appreciate someone telling me.",0.0,0.038720645010471344,0,1
64,1foyxrx,AITA for embarrassing a kid infront of his friends?,"Context: I work at a small ice cream shop where we also sell off-brand Pokemon card packs. The packs are displayed next to our cashier so customers can just pick a pack and pay. Our shop is next to a lakeside park and a school so most of our customers are kids.  
  
Now, what happened? A couple days ago, there was a kid (give or take like 11-12 yrs old) that stole a couple booster packs from the shop, we knew who it was because this is the third time he has tried to steal those cards. The previous times, we would catch him, he would play it off as a joke and run off, but this time he did it during a lunch rush and one of our customers just told us they saw a kid run with some booster packs. We checked our cctv footage and saw it was the same kid as the previous couple times.

The next day, I went to the park saw the kid that stole the cards playing with some other kids. I didn't approach them yet because I knew a grown adult approaching a bunch of kids would look weird no matter what the circumstance, so I just sat on one of the benches looking at the lake. Fortunately (or unfortunately depending on the circumstance) one of the kids had jumped into the lake and couldn't get back up and the kids had asked for my help pulling him back up. Then they asked me to stick around so I can help them in case someone else couldn't get back up again. Now, I wasn't a complete stranger cause the kids knew that I was ""the guy that works at the ice cream shop"" so some of them were asking if I was going to the shop after hanging out with them.

Now here's the problem, I told them that I got fired from the shop because my boss saw that I had let someone steal a bunch of cards from the shop. I said that maybe they could help me look for the kid that stole the cards so I could get my job back. The kids then said that I could leave it to them and they'll look for the thief. The kid that stole the cards then said that he knew who stole them because he saw a kid from the neighborhood walking around with a bunch of cards. Of course I knew it was a lie and I didn't want to get a random kid get lynched, so I said I have the cctv footage saved on my phone and they can see if it was the same kid he was referring to. And it was obvious that it was the kid that did it because he was wearing the same clothes as the previous day, this was when the other kids pointed out that it was him and was calling him a thief and tried to blame some one else. He confessed and I told him I wasn't angry and he just needed to pay for the cards he stole and i'll talk to my boss about it. I thought all is well but the problem is, yesterday the kids went to the shop and I could see them pointing at the cards while calling the kid a thief but they were all laughing about it (including the kid that stole the cards).

65,1foyw71,WIBTA if I took back a tip from the petsitting company owner?,"I have been overseas for 2 weeks and have a local company taking care of my cat while I‚Äôm gone. Idk how big the company is but I believe that it‚Äôs just the owner Dana and one employee Becca. They take great care of my girl, administer her meds (a few pills and an eyedrop), send me long updates with pictures and videos, and visit twice a day. My boyfriend is also home, he‚Äôs not on the trip with me. So my cat isn‚Äôt alone, I just want a professional to visit and give her 100% attention for 30 mins twice a day. 

During my current trip, Dana visited my cat 4 times and Becca visited 23 times. (Two visits per day for 13 days + 1 visit on day 14.) 

I sent my bf a text yesterday asking him to put the envelope out that says ‚ÄúThank you Becca!‚Äù this morning before Becca‚Äôs second-to-last and last visits. I‚Äôll be home tonight so Dana has already visited my cat for the last time. 

My text exchange with bf: 

Me: Hi hun can you do me a favor when you get home? See if there is an envelope in my office that says thank you Becca on it. And if you can find it, please keep $80 in the envelope and leave it out for her tomorrow morning.

BF: Yeah will do! Is she coming tomorrow morning/evening?

Me: I think so, since her report last night said Dana is doing the visits today. I figured if Dana was also coming tomorrow, Becca would have said Dana is doing the next 2 days and she had a great time with Harley.

Well I just got an update text from Dana who did last night‚Äôs visit which included: ‚ÄúThank you for the generous tip. I‚Äôll be sure to split it between Becca and myself.‚Äù

So my bf made a mistake and put the tip out early and maybe only left the cash out on its own, not in the envelope? Otherwise if it was in the envelope that said, ‚ÄúThank you Becca!‚Äù I would have expected that Dana would not take the tip. 

I‚Äôve worked at a mom & pop (one location) kids‚Äô birthday party place before where some parents would tip after the party, and the owners would 1. Split the tip evenly/proportionally between the employees who worked the party, so for example if it normally takes 4 employees to work the three different stations, and one employee just happens to be scheduled to follow the party to each station, they would get 75% of the tip and the other employee would get 25%. And 2. The owners never took any portion of any tips even if they were covering for an employee at one of the party stations. 

My bf can‚Äôt do anything about it now, but I am tempted to message Dana back and clarify that the tip was meant for Becca only. Or is Dana going to split it proportionally, which by my math would work out to approximately $68 to Becca and $12 to Dana? The total for the petsitting was $810. $30/visit for 27 visits.

66,1foymyo,AITA - Sister knowingly chose my preferred baby name after agreeing not to,"

Before I start, I understand you can't claim ownership of a name, and it's only a minor issue - just wanted to get opinions.

Long story short, my sister is 8 months pregnant. For the last several years, my fiance and I were open about wanting to use the name ""Julian"" with a view to calling them ""Jules"" for short when we eventually had a kid, which we plan to in the next year or so. We had mentioned this, and the desire to use ""Jules"" for short to my sister and her husband several times in conversations over the last few years, and even (jokingly, but seriously) mentioned that name was off limits and we had dibs. They said multiple times that totally understood and had dozens of other names in mind for their unborn, which they told us about. As silly as it sounds, I really dont ask much of my family, this was just always a name I loved and wanted for my son, and they knew that. It was one of the only times I can think of that I actually had said I'd really appreciate they accept my request. 

Today, as she grows closer to birth, she said ""oh, I know you want Julian, but we've settled on Jules for our child"". She tried to say that they were different names so didn't see the issue. I was a bit taken a back, like I say, of course I don't have ownership of the name, nor even have a child to name it (yet) but had specifically said and asked that they leave me with this name, and they had agreed they wouldn't consider it. 

AITA for being really disappointed and a bit hurt by this? The name holds no significance to them other than liking the sound of it. I find it really inconsiderate that despite their dozen or more names they had shortlisted, they disregarded them all, and instead took essentially the exact name I had asked they not. I know its only a small issue, but I feel like they almost went out of their way to disregard my small request because it worked out better for them. Obviously it's only a name, not the end of the world, but that she would knowingly disregard one of the only things I'd semi put my foot down on and just decide to do what she wanted instead sort of hurt a bit.

Okay. I‚Äôm shocked by the number of ppl I‚Äôve seen litter in a city that has better recycling and compost access than most. But today I hit my limit and I got the craziest reaction. 

I was walking my dog and a man in a car pulled into a red zone(facing the wrong direction) rolled down his window and threw an empty water bottle out of it. 
My first thought was ‚Äúmaybe that wasn‚Äôt him‚Äù or it was already on the ground and got thrown by the wind. But then I see him open the door and throw a can in the gutter‚Ä¶. So I decided to say something. It was a Karen like move but I called out ‚Äúhey is that your trash‚Äù and he quickly closed the door and tried to roll up the window.. So I walked up to the window and said it again‚Ä¶he saw red üòÇ He was practically foaming at the mouth and called me a ‚Äústupid fing b‚Äù while he hysterical tried to make a fast u-turn off the street. 
I just honestly looked at him like he was so dumb,called him a loser for littering and picked up his trash. But that was so dramatic of him frfr like his sudden and deep anger is what makes it funny to me. 

I get that ppl don‚Äôt want to be called out but come onnnn it‚Äôs broad daylight and you‚Äôre a grown man throwing trash on the street in 2024.You‚Äôd think you‚Äôd be bold enough to handle being called out right?

But I (29f)‚Äôve been living with my roommate (25f) since the beginning of 2024 and she‚Äôs been in the same situationship for the past 2, going on 3, years. 

And that‚Äôs legit all she fucking talks about. He (26m) keeps flipping on whether or not he wants to commit to her. 

And it‚Äôs starting to actually drive ME crazy. Roommate and I both live and work together, (I know that‚Äôs a mistake but we‚Äôre in too deep now) so I hear about their drama on the fucking daily, during the commute, during our downtime at work, and then again when we get home.

I have asked for some boundaries and for her to please stop updating me, but if it‚Äôs not about him then we legit don‚Äôt talk. Which sucks bc we were friends before they‚Äôve even met. 

I have tried to be empathetic, and give her space to vent. Sometimes I get over protective of my friends, but I‚Äôm done being the one who picks up the pieces every time Boyfriend divests himself of her. 

I‚Äôve told her, begged really, to leave this man, she says ‚Äúshe‚Äôs not looking for advice.‚Äù And while I know I have no idea what happens behind the curtain of their relationship, however I reached a breaking point when he dumped her before her birthday, and she got so drunk she locked herself in her room and called him (basically bailing on her own bday party she hosted at our house. Leaving me to entertain her other friends I don‚Äôt really know.) 

Now whenever he‚Äôs around I‚Äôve started to get genuinely upset to the point of disgust. And it‚Äôs making me not want to be her friend anymore. Maybe I overstepped but I‚Äôve asked Roommate to stop bringing him to our place for the sake of OUR friendship but she‚Äôs said this is her home too and it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot fair.‚Äù 

The worst fucking part of it all though, is that we have REALLY thin walls that divide our bedrooms and I‚Äôve had to use earplugs if I hear so much as a laugh. 

I‚Äôve fully strayed in Kendrick territory when it comes to this man. ‚ÄúI hate the way that you walk‚Ä¶ & etc.‚Äù That‚Äôs how much it‚Äôs grates on me.

74,1fow3uc,AITA for considering my colleague a friend and having expectations from her ,"Today I had a fight with my colleague over speakers. We are good friends and we‚Äôre comfortable enough to roast each other and have a friendly banter. When I joined the office 6 months ago, she had speaker attached to her pc and she would play songs for everyone.  As we got comfortable I asked her to change her playlist a bit cause the speakers would go on for 7 hours straights and I could listen to repetitive songs, she did but our music taste is very different so she didn‚Äôt like my songs and I didn‚Äôt like hers. So I sometimes teased her for her music taste to which she took jokingly at least on my face. I wasn‚Äôt aware that she held a grudge about that. 

 When some other colleague also started asking her to change she music she passed the speakers to the girl who sits next to me. We played for a few days but now I have to prepare for an entrance exam and I have permission to study in office hours if I am free. Since speakers were on for the whole day (We can‚Äôt stop playing music cause our team leader demands so)  I requested her to take back the speakers, to which she denied saying that she now listens to podcasts and doesn‚Äôt want speaker close to her, but the thing is previously she had told me that it doesn‚Äôt bother her much. But now she‚Äôs straight up denied taking back the speakers, we had an argument and since she was my close friend I was expecting her to understand my situation cause I need to study and can‚Äôt have speakers playing next to me but she asked me request the person next to her instead and I did so but that person also denied. I thought she was my friend and will consider taking back the speakers since they were with her all the time before. 

While arguing I told her that if I were at her place then I would‚Äôve done it for her (it was not to guilt trip her tbh I would‚Äôve genuinely did that for her) to which she rudely replied saying don‚Äôt tell me all that. I thought we had nice bond and I was deeply affected by the argument and couldn‚Äôt control myself so I started crying. She ignored me and kept talking to other people normally.

After that lesson, I get in the car with her, and my parents don't even tell me good job after I reminded them of what I did, genuinely excited.

 I brush it off then but later on I go to them and ask why they don't seem to care.

Last night she did her habit again, and while I had not done it in years, I had an urge to do it. Lets say that my parents and sister did not like it, as when I squeezed her cheeks she spat out the water at my dad who was sitting in front of her. 

Everyone got upset at me, and we left the restaurant early since my dad was soaking wet. Later at home, my family was really upset at me and told me to grow up and that I humiliated the family in public, and they have kind of been cold to me since. AITA?

My parents are both very aware of this. However, one night at dinner, when I spoke about my religion at the dinner table, Dad complained that my religion involved ""idol worship"" and that the 2nd commandment prohibited that. I was highly aggravated for 2 reasons:

1. Dad has been aware that I am NOT a Christian and have not been since 2017, and I have made it abundantly obvious by complaining about being in a Christian school when I was in high school (2016-2021). 
2. Dad himself is not a Christian; he just has an interest in Christianity.

I told him off severely, saying he should be well aware that since I am NOT a Christian, and under a different religious system, I do not need to follow those rules. Still, he retorted that he uses the Bible as a basis for life, while not believing in God. 

Mom, who is a Christian, said that ""when Jesus came to Earth, he only gave one commandment; love one another"", and that is the only commandment that is relevant today.

Still, I was angry and bitter for having beliefs that I do NOT follow shoved in my face.

82,1fot3gk,AITA for dropping off my friend's dog at a doggy daycare when I was supposed to be watching him,"My friend (25F) asked me(24F) if I could watch her dog, Cody, for a two weeks while she went back to her home state to deal with some family issues. She told me he was potty-trained, good with people, and good with other animals (I have a cat, Tawny).

I had been to her house a few times, and, at least during the times I've been there, he's usually a sweetheart. I said yes, and when it came time for her to leave, she dropped Cody and his things off.

First thing I realized is that Cody wasn't as house trained as she claimed. Maybe he knew it was wrong to pee in *his* house, but he clearly thought it would be perfectly okay to do it in mine. It happened on the first day, and when I told her, she said she had let him outside rather than walking him like she usually would, so maybe he had just sat outside and did nothing rather than do his business.

It had been on the vinyl wood floor and I caught it immediately, so I just let it slide, cleaned it up, and took him for a walk right after. But as the days went by and it happened more than once, it became clear to me that he just wasn't that well potty trained at all.

Second thing I realized is that, yes, he's friendly with other animals, but that doesn't mean good with other animals. Tawny had no problem with him when he was calm, but when he was hyperactive and getting all up in her space, she would get hissy and swipe at him.

I ended up banishing him from the upstairs. But that led to another problem: Cody hated to be alone at night. He absolutely hated it, and made sure everyone knew about it by whining and barking until he would tire himself out.

I finally ended up calling my friend and telling her that her dog isn't as well-behaved as she claimed, and that she needed to tell me another friend of her's she felt comfortable enough to hand him off to or that I was just going to end up sticking him in a doggy daycare that she'd either have to pay for or pay me back for.

She got upset and asked why I had agreed to dog sit if I was just going to dump him, but I agreed to dog sit a dog who was painted as not having behavioral issues. She couldn't find someone she could trust to take care of Cody, so I found a non-expensive but still decently reviewed doggy daycare to drop him off at. She said she'd pay me back since I ended up paying up front, but that she was really cross with me and wasn't sure if she could depend on me for things anymore. I felt totally justified originally, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I could totally understand why she'd be upset that I essentially went back on my word and also made her pay for a service she hadn't planned on using (I hadn't asked her to pay me to watch her dog). AITA?

Extra Info based on things I'm seeing commonly asked about and brought up: 

1. I know how to care for a dog. Before I moved out of my parent's house, I was the main caretaker for the family dog, Prince. One of the reasons I was convinced she hadn't trained Cody as well as she claimed was because Prince never had accidents no matter where he was once I had him potty-trained. He understood that if he's inside, he shouldn't do it. 
2. The daycare wasn't something I just chose on my own haphazardly. I looked through the places near me and she agreed on one for me to take him to according to reviews and pricing. 
3. I followed the instructions of Cody's care given to me. 4 walks a day with 4 hour intervals starting at 8 with a last call to the backyard before bed. As for attention, I¬†*like*¬†to think I gave him plenty. I played with him indoors and outdoors and he'd sit with me on the couch during downtime. He didn't really beg for attention during the daytime, and he didn't beg for attention during night until he got permabanned.
4. I wouldn't say Tawny is socialized with dogs per say, but Cody isn't the first dog she's been around. She's been around Prince, but we had him trained not to rush at people or jump at people and that translated to other animals as well by default, so she never had a problem with him. When my friend had told me ""good with people and other animals"", I had assumed that meant he probably had similar training. 

Honestly, based on the mixed answers so far, I'll probably end up just splitting the costs with her. It seems both of us didn't think this through during her rush to leave. I had a standard for what I considered a trained dog to be based off of Prince without considering that not every dog is going to be like Prince, and she didn't think about how Cody might be in a new environment he's never been before and assumed he'd behave as well as he did at home.

83,1fosshp,AITA: I (27M) fought with my girlfriend (24F) during my birthday due to ED and her insistence I take Cialis,"Here's the background:

We've been having problems with my ED for the past 6 months. 60% of the time, I get ED and 40% of the time it actually works. I'm actually convinced it's just all in the mind and sometimes it really doesn't want to get up. My girlfriend feels hurt because she believes that I should already get a boner when I see a naked girl beside me. We've been having fights already every week mainly due to sex and the fights would last till early morning 5 am even on weekdays where I have work.

Here's the story:

The day prior to my birthday, she said that since she has a lot of exams, she would just go out for dinner with me on my birthday and I would drop her off home immediately. I said okay. On the day of my birthday, she also got her period (we had a pregnancy scare because I wasn't able to pull out in time maybe due to the pressures of sex) so we were elated to know that she wasn't pregnant. She was complaining that her period was very painful and irritating and she was also on Plan B, so that could have contributed to the worsening period condition.

When we got to her place, she gave me her gifts for me and we had a moment because I found the gifts were touching and sentimental. We then started to try to have sex, and that's when I couldn't get it up. I'm not totally sure what's the reason but I think her having her period affected me which isn't normally the case. We would always do it on her period in prior months as well. Anyways, because I got her feeling horny already, she forced me to go home to take Cialis which I have been telling her already that I don't want to take it because of negative side effects to my body and I wish I would not take it on my actual birthday. Nevertheless, I still took it furiously. I then blamed her for her insistence that I took Cialis that I said I don't even like period sex and I don't even need to be turned on because since I'm on Cialis I could just get hard if I stimulate myself. Idk what happened to me, but I was just so enraged that she was so inconsiderate during my birthday. She's also in the medical industry field so she would say I know that Cialis won't harm you or affect you, so it's okay to take since the doctor prescribed it. Anyways, she felt that I lied to her because I kept on saying that I enjoy period sex during the start of our relationship to which I rebut that people actually change and I realized I'm not overly fond of it because of its messy nature. She also felt degraded because she felt that from what I said, she's just a sex addict who just needs to get it.

From that point on, she was so furious threatening to break up over 100 times and from our previous fights we promised not to say the word break-up. By then, I was already calm and trying to repent and say sorry to her but she was just so angry and mad. The only way to calm her down was I started to punch my head a lot of times and that's when she started to calm down. I even got a wound from punching myself. We ultimately resolve to stay in this relationship but I already know it's a toxic relationship. I don't know what to do because I can't talk to my friends about this :( Could people give advice? I really love her and I want us to work but I feel like the pain is also too much now.

87,1forx98,AITA For Waiting For A GOOD Apology From My Brother,"

Two months ago my brother and I got into an argument in a group chat with some mutual friends and truthfully I can't even remember at this point what it specifically was. But I know I didn't agree with it. I asked for them to explain what they said and my brother (24) got upset. Specifically my brother said in the group chat ""that's a dumb question and you know it"". Rather than make a scene I texted him directly asking him why he said my question was dumb when I wanted clarification on what our friend said.

This is when it devolved, he accused me of trying to cause problems about things nobody cares about. I told him that wasn't fair because I was just trying understand what they were saying better before I responded to them. He said I was lying. I told him he was misunderstanding what I said. At this point I think he realized that he did misunderstand what I said. However, instead of apologizing for misunderstanding me he apologizes like this: ""I'm sorry you didn't say what you meant to say.""

Now I know that I meant what I said. I asked for them to clarify what they were trying to say. Did they mean a or did they mean b? And I got angry and started being harsh with my own language. I know this is where I messed up. I started calling him an a-hole and more. And when I told him that was a really terrible apology he gave me, I realized I messed up with being harsh and I apologized as such: ""you know I'm sorry because I shouldn't be calling you harsh words. Also I don't want you to apologize for me saying the wrong things because I didn't. You misunderstood me. I want you to apologize for that.""

Well he left the group chat and told me I was being the a-hole. I told him he could call me when he wants to talk to me again and that I wasn't going to communicate through writing with him anymore. 

It's been two months and I actually really hate this situation so I messaged my brother the following: ""You know *brother*. I don't like this situation. I'm still waiting for you to apologize for the way that you've acted towards me man. I'm tired of this. I've been feeling kinda hurt for a while since you insisted that I mispoke when you misunderstood me. And honestly I feel bad, but dude. I just want an apology for you misunderstanding me and getting upset at me. And honestly, I want you to just call me already so we can act like actual fucking adults over this.""

His reply was ""I've tried to act nice to you but you have me muted on xbox and that's pretty mean""

I told him I don't want to act like nothing happened I want to work things out. 

I haven't heard back from him and it's been over 12 hours. And at this point I'm feeling nervous and full of anxiety. I've been off medication and out of therapy for about seven months now and I thought I had a grasp on things but I'm not sure anymore. 

So, AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-25,"AITA For Waiting For A GOOD Apology From My Brother 

Two months ago my brother and I got into an argument in a group chat with some mutual friends and truthfully I can't even remember at this point what it specifically was. But I know I didn't agree with it. I asked for them to explain what they said and my brother (24) got upset. Specifically my brother said in the group chat ""that's a dumb question and you know it"". Rather than make a scene I texted him directly asking him why he said my question was dumb when I wanted clarification on what our friend said.

This is when it devolved, he accused me of trying to cause problems about things nobody cares about. I told him that wasn't fair because I was just trying understand what they were saying better before I responded to them. He said I was lying. I told him he was misunderstanding what I said. At this point I think he realized that he did misunderstand what I said. However, instead of apologizing for misunderstanding me he apologizes like this: ""I'm sorry you didn't say what you meant to say.""

Now I know that I meant what I said. I asked for them to clarify what they were trying to say. Did they mean a or did they mean b? And I got angry and started being harsh with my own language. I know this is where I messed up. I started calling him an a-hole and more. And when I told him that was a really terrible apology he gave me, I realized I messed up with being harsh and I apologized as such: ""you know I'm sorry because I shouldn't be calling you harsh words. Also I don't want you to apologize for me saying the wrong things because I didn't. You misunderstood me. I want you to apologize for that.""

Well he left the group chat and told me I was being the a-hole. I told him he could call me when he wants to talk to me again and that I wasn't going to communicate through writing with him anymore.

88,1forq8u,AITA for playing trading card games once a week and on weekends every few months?,"When I was younger I used to love going to local game shops and playing trading card games. I also liked to travel and play at the larger weekend tournaments and considered myself fairly competitive. Over time and a couple moves across country I stopped playing them just because I didn't have a group to play with. Now my wife \[F32\] and I have 3 kids aged 2, 4, and 5. I work from home and she is stay at home as well.

About a year ago I made a friend who has started to invite me to play trading card games at a local shop again. We play almost every week on Monday and I leave the house at 4:30ish and get back anytime between 10-12. Every 3 months they have competitive events that take place month-long on the weekends at different shops so if I have the day free I will go play those which takes about 6-7 hours, ending around 5PM. For instance, in July I was able to attend 5 of the 8 weekend days (I missed the other 3 due to birthday parties and other family events). Also roughly once a year there is a major convention nearby for the game where you can go play in a large scale tournament. I attended the last one and was gone Friday morning and came home late Sunday.

Recently my wife has been saying that I play too much and that my family isn't a priority to me anymore. I don't feel like me asking to play once a week, every three months on weekends (schedule permitting), and once a year when a large scale tournament is close is too much. The game is the only thing I leave the house to go do with anyone and is my only real hobby that takes up time outside the house away from the family.

I feel like part of the issue is my wife never goes out to do anything. I always tell her to please go out with friends and do something fun but she never arranges any plans. I am more than happy to watch the kids and feed them and put them to bed if she wants to go out and do something. The only thing she will do on occasion is go shopping with her mom. I've even told her she could plan a weekend trip to get away with friends if she wanted. In the past, as a surprise I have canceled my plans and planned something for her to do without the kids so she could go have a fun night while I stayed home with the kids.

Is it unreasonable for me to ask to play my trading card game as much as I have been? In my mind, I don't think it is because if roles were reversed and she was going out with friends or doing her hobbies as often as I have been I would be fine with it. I feel like her main issue with it is that she never goes to do anything outside of the house for a break and I am not sure what else I can do to prompt her to do that. I want us to both be able to have outings and hobbies that we enjoy and love whereas I feel like she would rather us both just stay home all the time.",No A-holes here,2024-09-25,"AITA for playing trading card games once a week and on weekends every few months?
