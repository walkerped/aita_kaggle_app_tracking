0,1fozb0l,AITA for not paying attention in my geography class anymore?,"First off to start I am not a homophobic person, I have a cousin who is bi and we stay close. 
My geography teacher is gender fluid I think and for the past 5 classes we have been taking notes on Ted talk videos of trans people and their experiences and learning what different terms different parts of the world use to describe LGBT people. She has said that there will be a rally on September 20th called ‚Äúprotect our kids‚Äù in all cities of Canada funded by a ‚Äúwhite supremacist christian hate organization‚Äù (their words not mine). I was walking around that day after school with my friends and I didn‚Äôt notice any of that. I thought I might have maybe missed the part of town it was in but I searched it up later that night and couldn‚Äôt find any information on it. Anyways I have about 5 pages of notes now about what to call LGBTQ people from different countries and the correct terms so at this point I just stopped paying attention.

1,1foz6e9,WIBTA if i ask my cousin to be hygienic and wear formal clothes I‚Äôm buying for my wedding ,"My (F37) wedding is a formal affair to be held at Christmastime at our country‚Äôs largest and grandest cathedral. Despite this, the wedding is a small-ish family affair with some friends and obligatory work people (my boss) invited. 

Our theme is the formal national dress of our country. This means a shirt called barong for the men, and conservative long dress for the women. There is no color prescribed, and the ladies could wear white/offwhite if their formal wear is that color because the national dress for women often comes in those colors. 

I have a cousin who identifies as nonbinary. They are 19, and very deeply introverted. I asked them if it will be ok if they will not be part of the bridal party since our cathedral rites are very conservative. They said no sure they would not rather be and besides, the last time they were asked to be in the bridal party for another relative‚Äôs church wedding, they did not enjoy it. So I said cool, they will be my honored guest. 

I asked what they are comfortable wearing, since this is a formal event, and they answered, anything that is not a girly girl dress. I understood and I offered a very nice pair of dressy trousers and that we will look online for nice loose blouses/shirts that will be dressy enough. We are still looking right now.

I am also buying some of my other male relatives‚Äô formal top wear but budget is so limited at this point so they have to take care of the bottom part since I cannot buy that too. They all agreed that that is fair, because they get to keep the top. 

Now my nonbinary cousin does not have the best hygiene. During our grandmother‚Äôs 80th birthday at another formal event, they‚Ä¶.. neglected to comb their hair or brush their teeth to the point that I could see the remnants of her breakfast, let alone smell it. 

I want to tell them that gender expression and identity is one thing that one can freely decide on. But events are another thing. One has to brush one‚Äôs teeth, iron clothes or at least make sure they are presentable, and for the love of everything holy please take a bath and wear deodorant. 

They have problems at home, everything from financial to self-esteem issues to basically their parents giving up on them because they refuse to talk. I don‚Äôt know how deep the problems are. But I know their house has two showers and that despite being poor their father and mother regularly buy soap and other essentials. The enforcement is the one that is lacking I think.

I‚Äôve purchased most of my cousins/entourage‚Äôs clothes, and some are still pending shipping. Once they are all there, I plan to put them in nice bags and add a thank you card.  

Would I be the asshole/how can I avoid being the asshole if I tell my cousin to please use the hygiene kit included in their clothes? Is it a good idea to sneak in some deodorant and an array of soaps in the wedding clothes pack? 

For reference I am F37, identify as semi-religious. My future husband (M40) and I chose the great cathedral as our wedding venue because that place is significant to us both when we were both in college long aho, and it looks prettiest at Christmastime.
