2,1fq5b7p,"AITA for confronting my dad about his lifestyle choices?
","I (31F) have been staying with my grandparents to help them out while I figure out my next steps. My dad (50s) has always been coddled by my grandma, who is in her late 70s and has a history of favoring him as her firstborn. Many people have told her to stop coddling him, but if you bring any of this up to either of them, she gets mad, and he literally stomps away like a child. He’s struggled with addiction, neglects his health, and leaves a mess everywhere. Recently, he was hospitalized for an infection related to his diabetes, and I had to care for his puppy during that time.

  


He’s been given clear medical advice to stop doing drugs, manage his diet, and limit his activity due to his condition, but he continues to ignore it. I’m really frustrated because he often complains about feeling terrible and being alone, yet he refuses to take responsibility for his life.

  


Recently, my grandpa snapped after finding drugs on him, and when they got back home, I pointed out how my dad doesn’t take care of himself. I told my grandma that he needs to be treated like the grown man he is, but she just got upset and defended him. It’s almost disturbing to see how much she treats him like a child—at this point, all she needs to do is wipe his ass and tuck him in. When I expressed my feelings, my dad agreed that I don’t love him, and to be honest, I don’t feel much for him—he’s more of a burden to me at this point. He’s played the victim for so long that he realizes it can benefit him, and my grandma’s way of twisting the situation has started to make me feel like I’m overreacting.

This friend got into a house in the spring, we as a couple reached out a few times to get the dog back to him and we had had no response for a while.
 My ex and I broke up in June.
 I ended up contacting the friend a couple months ago and he had said he was gonna get the dog, we set up for him to come 3 weekends after the contact. Then he ended up not getting the dog and dropped off from messaging.

Today she is getting spayed. 
He contacted me outta the blue saying that he was gonna wanna pick her up within the next week or so. I said that he would have to pay for her procedure and money for me watching her. He said he'd pay for her getting spayed but he doesn't think that he should have to pay me for me watching her.
She is part of my fur family. I don't wanna just give her up. I think if he wants the dog that bad that I should be compensated like I was a boarding facility.
He's trying to say that she is his property. 
He's trying to bring the law into the matter.
I know legally own her now that she has been spayed under my name.

Would I be the asshole if I keep the dog?

Edit to add: It was agreed in the beginning that he was supposed to pay for her food and necessities. He paid for the first few months last year. Then he couldn't afford it so I took over. I was under the impression that I was gonna be reimbursed.

4,1fq4k5y,AITA for Questioning My Husband's Friendship with Someone Who Disrespects Our Marriage?,"My husband and I got married in July, and since then, I’ve had ongoing issues with a mutual friend, “A.” While my husband thinks her behavior is fine, I feel disrespected and uncomfortable, leading to several arguments between us.

A is someone my husband met through his D&D group. I didn’t know her well initially, but I got weird vibes during our first hangout. At a BBQ we hosted, I gave her a tour of our apartment, and she made strange comments about our possessions, asking how we could afford certain things and what my husband thought of them. I initially brushed it off, thinking she was just being curious, but as time went on, her behavior started to feel invasive.

To give her a fair chance, I invited her to dinner and a play, and we seemed to bond. Eventually, A became one of my bridesmaids, which I now regret. As we spent more time together, her behavior toward my husband became increasingly inappropriate. For example, she often made comments about how attractive she found him and even said she would sleep with him if given the chance. On three occasions, she said this directly to me. She also asked who in our friend group I found most attractive and then answered herself by saying my husband’s name.

A’s manipulation extended to another friend, ""C."" She told us she and C were fighting, implying we shouldn’t invite her to our wedding. After the event, when A and C reconciled, A told C different stories about why she wasn’t invited, suggesting that my husband and I didn’t like her, which created unnecessary drama.

During the wedding, A’s behavior was noted by friends. They mentioned she frequently touched my husband’s velvet suit and hugged him. Later, she told a friend she didn’t bring a gag wedding gift (a Ghostface mask) because it would “ruin my husband’s wedding night,” which felt incredibly disrespectful.

After the wedding, A spread rumors about our relationship, saying I was “financially abusive” because my husband and I keep separate finances. She also implied we weren’t sexually compatible and shouldn’t have gotten married. These comments were hurtful, especially since I tried to include her in my life.

Despite everything, my husband brushes off her behavior, saying, “That’s just how A is,” and insists he won’t confront her unless she makes a blatant move. I’ve told him her comments make me feel disrespected, but he doesn’t see it as serious because they weren’t made directly to him.

The final straw came when my husband wanted to help A move because she didn’t have a car. I couldn’t join them due to work, so I told him I wasn’t comfortable with them being alone together, especially given her history. While I trust my husband not to cheat, A’s behavior makes me uneasy. I don’t want them spending time one-on-one without clear boundaries. I’m fine with group settings, but am I being unreasonable for wanting to protect my marriage?

5,1fq4g61,AITA for wanting my GF to get her own car?,"I (31M) have been dating my GF (27F) for six years. We live together.

She has been using my car almost daily to get to work every day. Her work is far enough away that it would not be practical to get there by other means. I've owned the car since before we dated, since she got this new job we've split the insurance on it since I've added her as a driver.

However this is beginning to present issues in that she uses it almost every day for work, or if she wants to go out in the evening with non-mutual friends, that means I am more or less stranded and only have Uber as an option. If I have a medical appointment, want to hang out with friends, or want to use my car in general, I don't always have it. 

It hasn't been much of an issue lately, but I've wanted to get out in the world a bit more and do things and I feel as though this is starting to restrict me as I have to be always mindful of when she needs it and run everything past her when it's my car.

Her mother was supposed to give her her car, but she's really been dragging her heels for months and months now. In theory, the date I was told was next month, but I haven't heard a whisper of it, and given her behavior so far it seems like it won't happen until the start of next year or later.  
  
I have a good amount of money saved up, in theory, I could buy another car or give her this car, but I don't want to get rid of this car. It additionally seems a bit pointless when in theory she's getting another car from her Mom. I am very frugal, and I planned to drive it into the ground and then purchase another used car at some point in the future.  
  
Currently, my girlfriend probably has enough to buy another car - but doesn't want to deplete all of her savings, but I am kinda close to calling it tough shit.

Recently I asked another one of my friends to join us and wanted to lend her the extra harness because it is more comfortable than the rentable ones. I did not ask for this because I felt uncomfortable and unsure how to broach the situation. So my other friend just used the rentable one.

She also claimed my friend would only call her when she needed something from her. To add some context we’re both in our schools marching band, so we’re constantly busy. So I tried to explain that when the season starts we have little to no free time, and she seemed to shrug it off.

Later that day at practice I felt off about not telling my friend so I just told her during a break that I heard she and her friend were having issues, and she seemed confused by this. So I just told her flat out what i had been told, which I get can come off as not my place, but I ended it at that. I didn’t tell her to talk to her friend or anything and she ended up confronting her on her own terms. Which then spiraled later in the night into her friend and her blocking each other. I then heard from my other friend, that yesterday my art teacher said I was causing drama, I didn’t really think about it too much, just assumed that my friends friend said something to the teacher  and ignore it. 

However today, my art teacher came in to help my ceramics teacher. When she came in she didn’t say anything right away but suddenly called out to me and said it wasn’t my place to tell. After that she finished helping my ceramics teacher and left the room.

She then went on to tell me that she and my friend had been in an off and on friendship right now and that it felt one side. She also claimed my friend would only call her when she needed something from her. To add some context we’re both in our schools marching band, so we’re constantly busy. So I tried to explain that when the season starts we have little to no free time, and she seemed to shrug it off.

Later that day at practice I felt off about not telling my friend so I just told her during a break that I heard she and her friend were having issues, and she seemed confused by this. So I just told her flat out what i had been told, which I get can come off as not my place, but I ended it at that. I didn’t tell her to talk to her friend or anything and she ended up confronting her on her own terms. Which then spiraled later in the night into her friend and her blocking each other. I then heard from my other friend, that yesterday my art teacher said I was causing drama, I didn’t really think about it too much, just assumed that my friends friend said something to the teacher  and ignore it. 

However today, my art teacher came in to help my ceramics teacher. When she came in she didn’t say anything right away but suddenly called out to me and said it wasn’t my place to tell. After that she finished helping my ceramics teacher and left the room. Close to the end of the class my ceramics teacher apologized and said sorry if she made you feel bad, and that she didn’t know what it was about. So I just explained to her what happened and she apologized again to me.

He is not the babies father! The baby is his step grand daughter. His wife is around 40. 

Imagine my surprise when I discover that when his soon to be second ex wife left for a few days again (to get away from the mental and verbal abuse he’s been handing to her). He decides that my kid is going to babysit so he can go to work. Responsible parenting right?

He decided to call our child out of school under false pretenses so she could baby sit her step sister’s baby instead. She’s 13(our kid) and the baby is 1. He works over an hour away not including traffic btw. The babies mother(17) was at school in case you were wondering about that. I got called at 10:30 am my time and he’s an hour behind. He never notified me so of course I panic knowing my child is alone. I called for a welfare check just to make sure my kid was okay. Got confirmation from a cop that she was in fact all alone with the baby but ex husband lied and said the babies mom was just out for a few minutes so of course they believe him. He then messaged me to mind my business as if my child and her safety aren’t my business. Every time I ask to see the doctor note he changed the subject. First he claims the baby wasn’t even at the house. When I told him the cop told me the truth and to stop lying he lied yet again and said the babies mother had probably been out temporarily. This isn’t the first time he’s done this either. Did I overreact? Am I a shit mother? I have the texts too but it won’t let me post them.

12,1fq3k5x,AITA for calling my grandma and aunt weird and controlling and saying I won't help them bully my dad?,"Got into a fight with my grandma and aunt last week and I need to know if I'm TA or not. Since I was young my grandma and aunt have been pressuring my dad to date and find someone to marry. He was married to my (20f) and my brother's (22m) mom but she died when we were 8 months and almost 3 years old. Mom was only 23 and dad was only 24. He still considers them married in a personal sense. He loves her. He still wears his wedding ring. And he never wanted to date or went on a date with anyone since. That's what he says and he says he doesn't want to date again or fall in love again. He's good with being single.

I'm not sure when this started but I remember it came up from time to time in front of me and my brother. A few times my aunt would ask us if we wouldn't like a mom in the house or if we didn't want to have a bigger family. She'd always use her house as an example because she has 5 kids and a husband. She'd tell us we should talk to dad about it. But we didn't want those things so we never asked him to find us a new mom. Come to think of it I'm not sure we ever told dad about that stuff.

But anyway, dad's been an empty nester for two years now. And because of that my grandma and aunt are worse than ever. Grandpa died 4 years ago so grandma's a widow now too and still doesn't get dad's feelings. I heard them argue about it and she said it's different because she's old and had a long marriage but dad's still so young and was a baby when he lost mom and has only been with one person in his life.

Last week my grandma and aunt visited me at college and they wanted to talk to me about dad. They said they had tried to set dad up with someone and he was adamant he wasn't interested. So they were asking me to try and talk him into dating or find someone I thought he'd be interested in. My grandma said to think of it as picking out a grandma for my future kids and future nieces and nephews. They said my brother laughed in their faces when they brought it up to him so they wanted to bring it up to me instead. I told them I was pretty close. This led to a long defence of what they were asking and wanting to know if I didn't want dad happy and in love. They said men live longer when a woman takes care of them. I told them they were so weird for obsessing over this and really controlling with how far they're willing to go to make it happen. I told them to stop doing this and leave me out of it because I won't join them in bullying my dad. I walked away from them but they were trying to follow and yell at me for talking to them like that. They eventually left when they realized I wasn't going to hear them out more.

My sister (15f) and I (19m) are both doing online school at the moment (her attending a online institute and me doing university online) and my father (44m) works from home where my mother (39f) goes to work everyday, which is about a 45 minute drive from our home. So my mother asks us to do certain chores at home. Between me and my sister, I get more time to do the chores so I often help her with her chores when she's busy.

However, my mother sometimes gets frustrated over the quality of the chores. When she gets to the point of frustration that she cannot take it anymore (we have no idea when this happens) and bursts into our rooms in the morning to yell at us about said chores. This happens after she and my dad have had an argument.

She makes good points, in context of the chores. She also tends to go off topic and berate me, and have often referred to me as ""lazy"" or ""wanting to get at her"", when I am not actively doing so. This morning is blurry, but it is an example I can use here, and she pointed out how my room has been in a messy state and how I can't expect the cleaning lady to ""constantly clean up after me"" (I rarely let her clean my room) and that both my sister and I expect to be cleaned up after, which she then refers to me spilling water a couple of days ago and forgetting to clean up.

She got home tonight with a defeated look on her face and said ""I give up, help if you want, help if you don't want to."" I eventually went up to her and explained that I don't feel like she should get to do what she did today. She didn't offer the place for me to respond to her in the mornings, and it was rather a one-sided shouting match.

She explained to me her side, is that she realised that she shouldn't make her issues other peoples problems, and should correct these things herself, essentially. I don't agree with that line of thinking and have always been up to help her, even if I don't feel up to it.

My dad spends his whole day on a computer, he hardly helps. He rarely does things that aren't exactly what he's been told by her.

So 2 years ago this guy let’s call him Joe joined our school and began hanging out with us. So he was a little wierd and would get mad very easily which made others think it was fun to bully and mess with him. 

So another person in our group let’s call him Richard was friends with me and a couple others but was also friends with the people who would bully Joe. So they decided to catfish him by acting as a 15 year old girl ( he was 15 at the time) they messaged him and he would continuously message the account back and Richard would show us these messages.  

So at first I thought it was funny because it wasn’t harming anyone and me and Richard had done something similar to our other friends and we told them the next day and we all laughed about it. But the group who was bullying Joe took it to the next level and didn’t tell him it was them and within a day of them making the account Joe  had confessed his love to the account and began making lewd comments. Joe then sent a d pic to the account and when Richard told me I was disgusted. I wanted to tell Joe but it also ruined my view of him as he had sent a d pic to a girl he had talked to for only a day.

Now I began slowly distancing myself from him and eventually me and a couple of other guys in the group began hanging out with Richard and a couple of other guys from his group. This made us stop inviting Joe out and he began realizing this. So whenever we would post about something we did he would act like he was there with us and whenever we were talking about making a plan he would act like he was also invited and try and go with us. Now this caused us to start avoiding making plans with him as he began annoying people in our friend group and would cuss at them for not inviting him.

So recently we were going out and we didn’t invite him when he found out where we were going and when he went there and sat next to us. This made me mad because we told him that we wanted to go out with close friends so I shouted at him and told him that no one likes him and that we weren’t friends

I wanted to tell Joe but it also ruined my view of him as he had sent a d pic to a girl he had talked to for only a day.

Now I began slowly distancing myself from him and eventually me and a couple of other guys in the group began hanging out with Richard and a couple of other guys from his group. This made us stop inviting Joe out and he began realizing this. So whenever we would post about something we did he would act like he was there with us and whenever we were talking about making a plan he would act like he was also invited and try and go with us. Now this caused us to start avoiding making plans with him as he began annoying people in our friend group and would cuss at them for not inviting him.

So recently we were going out and we didn’t invite him when he found out where we were going and when he went there and sat next to us. This made me mad because we told him that we wanted to go out with close friends so I shouted at him and told him that no one likes him and that we weren’t friends

18,1fq1s0i,AITA for asking my mom to move in with me after graduation?,"Hello internet strangers! This was a sort of strange incident that happened a few weeks ago and it’s been weighing on my mind so I’d like to get some other opinions.

I (22F) am a senior in college and (fingers crossed) will be graduating next May. I am in a long term relationship and we are planning on getting engaged after graduation. My partner and I would like to move to New York after graduation. Obviously New York is a very expensive place to rent so we were looking for a roommate to help with expenses. Here’s the tricky part, when I told my mom that we were looking for a roommate she offered to move with us! 

This seemed like the perfect solution as my mom works remotely, she can afford NY rent, and we both LOVE having her around. We’re also planning on trying for a baby in a year or two and she is very happy to help us raise him/her. I’ve always thought multigenerational households are good for kids so this worked out perfectly. 

I am very close to both of my parents however they got divorced this past summer. My mom asked for the divorce and my dad is devastated, as one would expect. When he heard that my mom was planning on moving to NY from their current home in California he got super angry. He says he feels betrayed and that he would also have moved in if I’d just asked him. He says it feels I’m choosing sides. 

The truth is I love my dad but he is very difficult to live with. I think our relationship is better when we live apart. He also, admittedly, has no interest in babies and “only changed three diapers” despite having two kids. I’m not trying to bash him he’s a lovely man but we’re better off not being roommates.

I do understand why he’d be upset though and how it could feel like his family is abandoning him. to move across the country. I’m just really torn about the whole situation. AITA?

19,1fq1pg8,AITA for living with my dad?,"Okay, so I (f 15) have decided to live with my dad instead of my mom. 

For a bit of backstory, I've always been switching between my mom and dad every other week and it's not been much of a problem up until a few years ago. Now, it's not like anyone is abusive physically but I have the feeling that my mom is trying to manipulate and guilt trip me (which is another reason I prefer being at my dad's). 

So, ever since my mom and I moved into a new house last year I've felt like I'm always under surveillance; like I can't leave my room without being questioned about what I'm doing. My mom doesn't work because of her PTSD so she's always home, which makes me feel like I can't be independent. My dad works quite a lot and has a life outside of being a dad, which is nice because I get the daytime hours to do my own thing like school, baking, gaming, etcetera.

Now that you've got an idea of what the situation looks like, let's get into it.

A few days ago I woke up (at my dad's) and I broke down, having held in my feelings about being at my mom's for a while, finally deciding to take care of myself. Now, here is where I admit that I'm probably in the wrong, I got my dad to call my mom and tell her that I'd stay with him for a while, I admit that it's childish but I couldn't get myself to do it. But I feel like my mom overreacted about it, getting super pissed and falling into the victim role, ""So I'm never gonna see my child again?""  ""I'm just a terrible mom then?""  ""You and your dad always make me out to be evil"" (we don't lmao) stuff like this which I feel is very manipulating considering the circumstances. She also always makes drama about little things like which house I keep what clothes at and she always goes to money ""Well if you're not gonna be here I won't pay your allowance"" which, fair, but why use it as a threat?

My sister is one of those people who has no common sense, and somehow manages to mess up the most simple task. She is currently staying with our parents to avoid catching my germs. 

She asked me this morning if I needed anything dropping off from the shop. I sent her a list of 6 items. They were specific items. Items I liked, items my stomach could tolerate. She asked where to leave them, I told her to leave them in the front porch, as the house is a mess currently and is still a biohazard. Of course as soon as I am better I realise it’s my job to thoroughly disinfect the place and replace any damaged items.

So my sister arrives at the house this afternoon, with a *deliveroo bag*. Only one item is what I wanted, everything else was either; plain wrong (had been substituted to a different item), not the brand I wanted, or something she had added in (on my dime) ‘because she thought I would need it’. To make matters worse, she lets herself in *touching all the surfaces* as she does so, and starts putting it away.

I go downstairs and go ballistic. I tell her why tf is she in the house when she knows it’s a fucking biohazard and why did she get a deliveroo order when I could have just done that myself? I told her the whole point of asking to pick up items was to PICK THEM UP personally to ensure it’s what the person asked for. She started muttering about ‘feeling under the weather herself’ (for something else) in which case I told her that in that case she shouldn’t have offered.

When she was 15 and he was 19. I've been best friends with her since we were little kids. She had a rough life. Her mom doesn't give a shit about her and older men picked up on that.

In Dylan's defence, Cris lied on the dating app at first and said she was 18. Then once they met, she told him she was not. He felt weird at first, but said ""age is just a number""

Dylan thought he was a good guy because he didn't sleep with her until she turned 18. But yet it was fine for her to go down on him. I never liked him but he's not a horrible guy like some people I've met.

They've kept in contact on and off and she's always been in love with him. But he was a lost person trying to find his way. They stayed in touch. But he was always unavailable. He said he morally didn't feel correct and didn't want to hurt her.

They seemed to reach each other at the same time of year. All these ""weird coincidences"" that shed tell me. She would dream about him and hes in distress. Then he would reach out to her randomly being in distress. So she takes that as something more.

Then 6 months ago, she tells me they reconnected for the first time in over two years. They met up. He confessed his love to her.

24,1fq10gg,AITA for trying to evict my family home’s elderly caretaker?,"TLDR: entitled family vacation home caretaker of 20 years is not caretaking the home despite living there rent free. Grandfather wants to let her stay, mom and I want to evict her. 

My grandparents bought a vacation home in a small mountain town back in the early 2000s and found P, an older retired woman, to be a tenant and caretaker. 

P is expected to do basic things like periodically dust, drip faucets in the winter and run dehumidifiers during the summer, coordinate with landscapers, and notify us if the house needs any repairs (which my family pays to have fixed). **Importantly, P does not and has never paid rent or utilities. She lives in the home for free. My grandfather is a bleeding heart, and she’s friends with some of my grandparents closest friends.**

Over the past decade P has become increasingly difficult and has let the house fall into disrepair. My partner and I unknowingly moved there in 2022 and stayed for a year. In that time we discovered leaks in the roof and windows, rotting siding and porches, mold, etc. Tens of thousands of dollars of repairs. 

When we tried to find a contractor P fought us. She insisted that the work didn’t need to be done. She told that everything was fine. She lied about when major appliances (eg hot water heater) were serviced. She told us we weren’t allowed to have contractors come into her part of the house, despite giving multiple heads up over multiple days prior. 

She is emotionally combative towards my family and is generally one of these “woe is me, the world owes me” type of people. 

We don’t see any signs of dementia or altered sense of reality (I work in the mental health field and am familiar with what these look like) that would explain the behavior, although I suspect a personality disorder. My partner and I now avoid staying there because dealing with her is exhausting. 

My mom and I want my grandfather to evict her. We feel that she is going to continue to damage the house. My grandfather was initially on board, but now is hedging and saying he feels bad and just wants to wait for things to “naturally take their course”. 

AITA for continuing to pressure my grandfather to evict her? She is financially supporting a disabled sister on only SSI. She likely would not be able to find other housing in the area. I believe housing is a basic human right…but I don’t think that means we need to provide that housing. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-26,"AITA for trying to evict my family home’s elderly caretaker? TLDR: entitled family vacation home caretaker of 20 years is not caretaking the home despite living there rent free. Grandfather wants to let her stay, mom and I want to evict her. 

My grandparents bought a vacation home in a small mountain town back in the early 2000s and found P, an older retired woman, to be a tenant and caretaker. 

P is expected to do basic things like periodically dust, drip faucets in the winter and run dehumidifiers during the summer, coordinate with landscapers, and notify us if the house needs any repairs (which my family pays to have fixed). **Importantly, P does not and has never paid rent or utilities. She lives in the home for free. My grandfather is a bleeding heart, and she’s friends with some of my grandparents closest friends.**

Over the past decade P has become increasingly difficult and has let the house fall into disrepair. My partner and I unknowingly moved there in 2022 and stayed for a year. In that time we discovered leaks in the roof and windows, rotting siding and porches, mold, etc. Tens of thousands of dollars of repairs. 

When we tried to find a contractor P fought us. She insisted that the work didn’t need to be done. She told that everything was fine. She lied about when major appliances (eg hot water heater) were serviced. She told us we weren’t allowed to have contractors come into her part of the house, despite giving multiple heads up over multiple days prior. 

She is emotionally combative towards my family and is generally one of these “woe is me, the world owes me” type of people. 

We don’t see any signs of dementia or altered sense of reality (I work in the mental health field and am familiar with what these look like) that would explain the behavior, although I suspect a personality disorder. My partner and I now avoid staying there because dealing with her is exhausting. 

My mom and I want my grandfather to evict her. We feel that she is going to continue to damage the house. My grandfather was initially on board, but now is hedging and saying he feels bad and just wants to wait for things to “naturally take their course”.

25,1fq0oym,AITA for telling a woman she shouldn’t bring her aggressive dog to a coffee shop? ,"TLDR: I confronted a woman who brings her aggressive dog to a coffee shop we both frequent. 

I have been frequenting this coffee shop for months and I love it. It’s dog friendly and there’s a large open terrace where people enjoy coffee while they working on laptops, enjoy one another’s company, or just sit in peace. Until… this woman started coming with her dog a few weeks ago….

First of all, she lets her dog roam around. It has a leash on, but she doesn’t hold it, nor does she pay attention. The dog barks loudly at any other dog that is near and the woman either ignores it, or even worse, has the audacity to tell people to “stay away” or not sit near her. I’ve heard her say it’s only small dogs or it’s only brown dogs etc etc that triggers her dog. And that he’s great otherwise. 
 
Today I had enough… the only seat was across from her, so I sat down and her dog became disgruntled - mind you, my dog doesn’t bark at other dogs or show any signs of aggression or provoking of any kind. She asked if I could find somewhere else to sit because her dog would BITE mine…. Why in the WORLD would you bring a dog in public regularly that has behavioral issues and a potential safety risk …and expect everyone else to cater to your issue. 

I tried not to cause a scene, but I lost it. I told her she’s being a rude b**** and  is disrespectful for bringing her dog to a public establishment. Everyone else shouldn’t be hindered to enjoy a wonderful environment so she can bring her unhinged dog. No wonder the dog is unhinged - she is. 

Anyway.. I was so upset with myself for losing it that I left today, but I still want to gob back. I just couldn’t tolerate being near that woman today. I’ve expressed my concerns with the shop manager, but they haven’t done anything about it.

27,1fq0ga7,AITA for telling my mom she's punishing me and my brother more than our grandparents and extended family?,"My mom had this big, huge even, fight with my (dad's side) grandparents a few months ago. She decided she doesn't want to have anything to do with them going forward and she has decided to punish them by keeping me (17f) and my brother (14m) from them. She can't stop me for long because I'll be 18 in a few months but my brother's only 14. She already took our phones and deleted their contacts on our phones. So she means serious business.

Some bg/context for this stuff before I go into what I said. My dad died when I was 7 and my brother was 4. It was a work related accident and mom got money because of it. She had my grandparents help her set up some accounts for our future with the money. Nobody can touch those except for me and my brother when we each turn 18. So we stayed close to our dad's side after this and mom got married again when I was 10. She had a baby a few weeks after the wedding. Mom and dad's side had discussed things going forward. They agreed to include mom's husband and any half siblings we'd have. But they said it wouldn't be the same and they'd still want time with just me and my brother without our half siblings. My mom agreed. And so we'd all see them and spend time with them. My half siblings were never treated like grandkids or anything by dad's side but more like family friends.

My mom and her husband got the wrong idea over time though that my dad's side had grown to love and consider our half siblings their family/grandkids. So a while back, my brother and I had gone to stay at dad's best friends house with his family and my mom and her husband wanted a night off. Mom called my grandparents and asked if they wanted a grandkid sleepover. My grandparents were like of course. But then it became clear that it was our half siblings and not me and my brother. It pissed mom off that they weren't as excited and when my grandparents asked how long my half siblings would be there. My mom ended up getting really angry about it. When we got home she was already so pissed. It only got worse when she learned my grandparents had money saved for me and my brother like their other grandkids but not my half siblings. This is what led to, well, this shit.

My brother and I haven't been allowed to see them and we missed them like crazy. Mom told us we shouldn't stand for their favoritism and she told us we should stand by our half siblings. She gets annoyed whenever we talk about missing our dad's side. And she told my brother it was really sad to her that he wasn't more angry on their behalf and that he'd miss people like that.

31,1fpzr1j,AITA for telling my father that it was his fault he missed my son's first birthday party?,"My son turned one this past weekend. On Sunday, my husband and I threw a birthday party for him at a local kids venue. We confirmed the date, with both the venue and our guests, a few months ago. One of those guests was my father. Back when I informed him of the date, he told me he'd come. 

A few days before the party, he asked if there was any way for me to reschedule it. I said no, as we'd already confirmed everything with the venue. My father then told me he'd be late to the party because there was an event at his girlfriend's church on the same day, and she wanted him to attend.

I should say that my immediate family, including my father, is technically catholic, but none of us practice it. However, my father's girlfriend is VERY religious. Like, Jesus as her phone wallpaper religious. Since they started dating (a little over a year ago), my father has been attending church with her on a semi-regular basis. He has explicitly told me he doesn't like it, but does it to make her happy.

I told my father I was fine with him being late, as long as he came to the party at some point. He said he'd show up as soon as the church event was done.

A few hours before the party ended, my father texted me the event was still going, and he thought ""it would be in poor taste"" for him to leave early, so he probably wouldn't be able to come. I didn't hear from him again that day.

On Monday, my father called me to explain that the event went on for longer than he expected. He didn't apologize, but asked if I was angry at him, and I said yes.

He said he had no way of knowing the event would last as long as it did, but that's not what I'm upset about. I told him he still chose to prioritize an event he didn't even want to attend over his grandson's first birthday party, made several other choices that led him to completely miss the latter, and didn't inform me about any of that until the last minute. All of those decisions were his, so the fact he ultimately didn't come to the party was his fault.

My father is still refusing to apologize, and insists I have no right to be angry over something he had ""no control over.""

I'm starting to feel odd about this. My husband is on my side, but my sister told me I'm being dramatic.

33,1fpzbc3,AITA for snapping at my girlfriend and telling her to het hold of herself during a hike?,"I (M29) and my girlfriend ""Maya"" (F30) both enjoy hiking in the mountains. We're not very experienced hikers (we only hike on easy or intermediate level trails), but we always have adequate boots, clothing, first aid kits and water and food supplies. We're also both healthy and have quite good physical condition. So, overall we are not stupid tourists who go on a difficult trail in flip-flops.

Our last hike turned out to be a bit more difficult than we expected and while we continued through the planned route, we were both tired and not in the best moods. Additionally, it turned out to be an unlucky day for Maya, as she slipped and fell - twice - on a fairly short section of the route. Just to be clear, I am very sure that it wasn't caused by her lack of preparation or inexperience - the route was really tricky and slippery there and she got unlucky. She didn't hurt her legs, but she bruised one of her hands pretty badly and had some difficulity to move it (later it turned out that it was just badly bruised, but for a moment it looked somewhat serious).

After her first fall Maya was somewhat shocked and hurt but we continued our hike, though she was crying a bit. After her second fall, when she further damaged her already bruised arm, she sat on the ground, told me that she's in shock, scared and she has to wait a while to calm herself. She put some anti-swelling ointment on her arm and bandaged it a bit and drank some water (fair enough), but then even though she did everything she was supposed to, she still sat there and cried hard, hysterically even.

I told her that if she'd finished, we have to continue walking. She answered that her legs are wobbling due to stress and she has to calm herself a bit more before continuing, or she'll fall yet again. At that point we were sitting for a quarter of hour or so - more than enough time to rest.

I got upset and snapped at her that she has to get hold of herself and that we don't have a whole day, but we need to reach our car before dusk. (It would take about an hour for us to walk the rest of the way, and there were only two hours left before it would be dark.) I also told her that I hate when she's panicking because it makes her unstable (she really HAS tendency to panic whenever she hurts herself more seriously).

She listened to me and we reached our car in time. However, Maya was crying most of the time and wasn't talking to me. Later she told me that I didn't respect her wish to calm and I put us both in danger, as she was unsteady on her feet, because she couldn't calm herself. According to her, we could wait additional fifteen minutes and still be in our car before darkness. She called me a self-absorbed jerk. I only wanted to make sure that we won't have to go through the mountain forest in the dark, which IMO would be even more dangerous.

First some background information that will explain the story and why I am the way that I am. We have to go back 4 years. Back in 2020 at the beginning of COVID, I lived with my mom. We was very close. She was my rock. She got sick with Covid and passed 1 month later. After her service, I went numb and blacked out for about 5 or 6 months. During this time, my dad was not in my life. He walked out 4 years before. Things were bad and my family fell apart in front of my eyes within 2 years after mom died. I was forced to live with my grandmother who would not look at me or really try to reconnect with me since mom died. My grandmother was actively gaslighting me and making me feel crazy because of the grief and survivors guilt I had. She would also make me feel bad because I put myself in Thearpy.

38,1fpywbi,AITAH for refusing to take my sister’s kids to school after they’ve been bullying my son?,"A bit of background: My sister (Sarah) and her two kids (Jake 14M and Mia 12F) recently moved in with us after Sarah went through a rough divorce. She’s been staying with us for about six months now, and we’ve tried to be as accommodating as possible. My wife (Laura) and I have one son, Ethan (13M). At first, everything was fine, and the kids got along okay.

Over the last few months, however, Jake and Mia have been making Ethan’s life miserable. They’ve been teasing him constantly, calling him names, and even going through his things when we’re not around. It’s been especially bad for Ethan because he’s more introverted and quiet. He’s come to us multiple times, upset about things they’ve said or done, and I’ve tried addressing it with Sarah. Her response has been pretty dismissive, saying, “It’s just normal sibling stuff. They’ll grow out of it.”

The tipping point came last week when Ethan told me that Jake had taken his school project – something he’d spent days working on – and ruined it by drawing all over it. Ethan was in tears. When I confronted Jake, he laughed it off like it was a joke. Sarah didn’t seem to think it was a big deal and said Ethan was being too sensitive. Laura was furious but tried to stay calm.

I finally had enough and told Sarah that if she couldn’t keep her kids in check, I wasn’t going to keep doing favors like driving them to school every day. I’ve been taking all the kids to school since Sarah moved in because her car broke down and she hasn’t been able to get it fixed. It’s about a 20-minute detour for me, and I was happy to do it at first, but after all this, I told her it was too much, and she needed to figure it out on her own.

Now, Sarah is upset, saying I’m punishing her and her kids over something small, and it’s not fair for me to leave her stranded. She even went as far as to say I was being petty and holding a grudge against the kids. She thinks I’m overreacting and should just let it go for the sake of family harmony.

My wife is 100% on my side and thinks Sarah’s kids have been out of line for months. But now Sarah’s giving me the cold shoulder and telling other family members that I’m being unreasonable.

I was 2 months from graduating college and my boyfriend just got an amazing job offer that would be 900 miles away from our home. We went back and forth for a few days deciding on whether to keep the child. It was very emotional for us. We didn’t feel comfortable bringing a child into a world where both parents are not financially situated, we live in a small apartment and it just wasn’t the right timing for us. We got an abortion at planned parenthood and i was emotional that day and weeks after. I made the mistake of telling my mother I was pregnant (we tell each other everything) her first response, “So you’re getting an abortion right?” Her bluntness and matter-of-factness was off putting given that my younger brother (21) and teenage girlfriend (19) just announced their pregnancy and my mom was ecstatic. She said I am not ready to be a mother and it’s not the right time. I told her how emotional this was for my bf and I and she confessed she’s had one as well in her 20s but the difference with us, it didn’t bother her and she was happy at the time and now that she got her abortion. I asked her not to tell my father and kept my secret.

Since then she makes BAD jokes about my abortion after telling her several times how uncomfortable and upset it makes me.

42,1fpxdy5,AITA for calling out lazy shopper with their abandoned cart?,"Hello, new account so this doesn't connect to my regular lurking. 

Late last night, I (35F) went to my local grocery store to grab a few things for my kid's class the next morning. It was dark and very slightly raining as I was walking back to my car, and I saw the passenger (woman wearing pajama bottoms) get in the car next to mine, leaving their shopping cart in the middle of a parking space. Literally 1 parking space from the cart return corral and since the corral was in the closest parking space to the store, they had walked right past it to get to their car. 
In the dark, I assumed the driver was the adult (woman, already in the car) and the passenger was the young adult/teen, so I thought maybe the kid was just being lazy and the parent didn't know they'd left the cart.
Now we live in a relatively small town, 10k population, so it's pretty rare to see an abandoned cart. 

Here is where I might be an AH. I loudly asked if they were going to leave the cart there. The driver popped open her door to hear better so I repeated myself. Immediately the passenger popped out and said ""Yes, I am. Do you have a problem with that?"" 

I replied that it seemed kinda rude. 
She then yells at me that it's rude to confront a teenager (I think she might have said young person) and to not parent her child. 

Well, I guess the adult did know. I said that this was about being a good community member and that it's rude to leave the cart. 
She just scoffed, got back in, and they left. 

I'm probably the AH. But as my penance, I did put their cart away with my own. Since apparently, it was too far for mom to walk. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-26,"AITA for calling out lazy shopper with their abandoned cart? Hello, new account so this doesn't connect to my regular lurking.

43,1fpxbwk,AITAH for not going to my niece's pageant?,"My (45f) niece, Emily (16), has always been a dancer. This year, she's an officer for her school's dance team, so I called my sister, Anna (43) to ask about a good home game to attend to watch her perform. I live about an hour and a half away, and I don't usually drive at night. We decided that I'd go to the homecoming game, and I made arrangements with my kids to go, and my son will drive.

Our hometown also has a festival every year (a different weekend) that includes a parade, vendors, and a pageant, which Emily is also doing. 

Yesterday, I was talking to my mom, and she said ""I'll see you Saturday!"" Thinking I had my dates wrong about the homecoming game, I asked, ""Is homecoming this weekend? I thought it was later this month?"" She said, ""It's Western Days. Anna bought your ticket for Miss Western Days because Emily is in it.""
The way we usually do these events is that Anna buys my ticket, and I pay her back and make arrangements to be there. Anna knows I don't feel comfortable driving at night and my sons are my ride.

So, I messaged Anna and explained that my sons are working and I don't have money to pay her back for the ticket, and I specifically wanted to go to the homecoming game to see Emily dance and meet up with old friends. The pageant is basically a 3 hour show of 55 seniors parading around in pretty dresses, and a local semi-celebrity giving a concert (he's a country singer who used to tour with big names, but he hasn't produced new music in 30 years.)

Anyway, Anna got huffy and said, ""Well, if you don't want to be there to support Emily, that's on you. She'll be hurt, but she knows you don't support her.""

I lost my job about three months ago, and while I’ve found part-time work, it doesn’t pay nearly as much as before. We’ve had to cut back on a lot of things, but it feels like no matter what we do, we’re still living paycheck to paycheck and even pulling from savings.

Recently, my mom (65F) came over to visit, and she noticed how stressed I was about the money situation. She offered some advice on how we could save money—things like cutting down on takeout, meal prepping to avoid buying groceries multiple times a week, and switching to cheaper brands. My mom has always been frugal, especially when she was raising me and my siblings on a tight budget. I thought it made sense, especially since we’re really trying to save wherever we can. I asked if she was willing to go through our spending and show where we could cut down. My wife agreed with this.

She made a whole spreadsheet about our spending, and we are spending wayyyyy to much on fun stuff. We don’t need Starbucks everyday and so on. It also became apparent that most of the fun spending was my wifes

Tbh my wife didn’t take the breakdown well and started arguing with my mom that her spreadsheet was wrong. She said that my mom’s way of doing things is “outdated” and doesn’t work for us. She doesn’t want to give up buying organic produce, and she likes having variety in what we eat each week. I tried to explain that we need to make some sacrifices if we want to get out of this financial hole, but she kept insisting that things weren’t as bad as I was making them out to be and that we just needed to “ride it out.”

My mom left at this point and we were still arguing, and she told me she can’t give up her takeout . She also went on about my mom being wrong.

45,1fpwy27,AITA for not keeping the floors cleaner? ,"My wife is angry with me for not doing a better job keeping the floors clean. This has come up before and she says some women would divorce their husbands for repeatedly not improving in this regard.

This refers to tasks that are not typically part of how our common household chores are divided. 

For context, here are things I regularly do: almost every single wake up overnight with the kids for the past 3 years, every diaper change (she does maybe one a week), bathe two kids every other night, brush their teeth, manage the trash & recycles, do most with the dishwasher, keep water bottles in fridge, get kids breakfast and lunch almost daily, feed baby his bottle every time, place most of the online grocery orders and it varies who puts orders away. 

We both work. I wfh full time. She works roughly 32 hours a week across three different employers. She is out of the home 4 days a week, & 3-4 hours a week dedicated to wfh. She cooks 5-6x/week with me doing crockpot etc. once a week. She does maybe 2x loads of laundry a week & does most folding, coordinates medical & dental appointments, and activities the family does. I coordinate the bills, we both look at the budget. She does bedtime with the girls, I do with the boys. She is usually in bed by 9. I am sometimes done around 9, but sometimes much later when our youngest (under 1yo) is still awake. I exclusively take care of him until he’s asleep, sometimes juggling the baby and studying. I recently got certified and am continuing to work towards a better job (currently making a bit north of $80k). 

We both clean, with me tidying up toys, trash and dishes, and her always being the one to mop, use cleaning products etc. My wife has had health issues limiting her for most of the last couple years (back, kidney stone, pregnancy complications and so on). 

Not to mention, she leaves the house at 7am each morning, and I get up with her at 6am to prepare her bag, give her some snacks, a sandwich or two for lunch, laptop and I direct our oldest to get ready. Until recently my wife always prepared our oldest’s school lunch, but I’ve started getting involved with that as well. I also mow the front lawn every other week but a lot of landscaping goes neglected due to time limitations. My wife takes our oldest to her weekly extracurricular, and she hates commuting, so it’s another hour in the car on top.

47,1fpwsdw,AITA for having a problem with my dad removing pictures of my dead mum to please his girlfriend?,"So my mum died 5 and a half years ago after a short battle with cancer, leaving behind me (28F) my dad and my sister (26F). 2 years ago, my dad started dating someone new. Since they have started getting more serious, she has started to express some discomfort with having pictures of my mum around the house. My dad wants to respect her wishes (and has also said that he is ok with it as he wants to ""move into a new phase""), but the problem is that my sister and I feel differently about this. From my perspective, I don't see why someone my dad is dating should be able to remove pictures of my mum from my family home. He has conveyed essentially that she will never be comfortable with having pictures of her on the walls. I can have them in my room if I want but not in the public spaces.

Where I see where she and my dad may have some  ground for this is that she spends more and more time at ours, and I am at my boyfriend's house for half the week. I have also temporarily moved back home after living overseas for a while, and will probably move out next year.
My response to that would be that it is my family home, I grew up here, my mum died here, and I have a lot of memories here. I think it's crossing a boundary for her to remove pictures of my mum in my house, and I also think it's just symptomatic of her own insecurity and won't actually solve anything in the long run. I have expressed all of these feelings to dad and he just thinks that I don't want him to have a relationship and move on. AITA?

EDIT:

Thank you everyone for your comments.

As some have asked, I would like to provide a little more context about the housing situation:

I don't have any sort of legal ownership of the house. My mum's share went to my dad when she passed so yes, he is the sole owner. The mortgage is paid off, so while I do not pay rent, I contribute equally to bills and groceries. I would like to buy my own place next year, but realistically the housing market in Australia is near impossible to enter for people my age without some parental help.

I've been extremely lucky that both my mum and my dad have always made sure that my sister and I know that this is our house too, and will always be a safe place to come back to. My dad has never made me feel like an imposition in my house. I understand why people might say I have no say in this because it's not my house, but we've always been the sort of family where our house has always been ours, rather than just our parents'.

And here's a little more background on where and how the issue started: 

When mum died, dad redid the whole house, renovated every room, got rid of a lot of old furniture. He removed a lot of family photos and every trace of mum. We also never talked about grief - he started dating six months after she died because he was so committed to moving on. Last year my sister put the photo of mum up to aid her in her grief. It's this one photo that has caused the issue with dad's gf, no one's built a shrine.

There are also photos of my dad and his new gf on the mantlepiece as well, which we never had a problem with. However, only one photo of my mum is apparently too much for my dad's gf to handle.

My dad has never made me feel like an imposition in my house. I understand why people might say I have no say in this because it's not my house, but we've always been the sort of family where our house has always been ours, rather than just our parents'.

And here's a little more background on where and how the issue started: 

When mum died, dad redid the whole house, renovated every room, got rid of a lot of old furniture. He removed a lot of family photos and every trace of mum. We also never talked about grief - he started dating six months after she died because he was so committed to moving on. Last year my sister put the photo of mum up to aid her in her grief. It's this one photo that has caused the issue with dad's gf, no one's built a shrine.

There are also photos of my dad and his new gf on the mantlepiece as well, which we never had a problem with. However, only one photo of my mum is apparently too much for my dad's gf to handle.

48,1fpwiz2,AITA for I kicking my grandmother out of my birthday dinner?,"(I would like to apologize for possible grammar mistakes and awkward sentences, English is not my first language.)

I (25f), have great relationship with my family, except for my paternal grandmother (82f). 

A little background. She is something me and my mother call ""religious fanatic"". When I was younger, around 12, I cut my finger really deep with a knife while I was preparing some snack for myself. She was only one at home, my parents had to run some errands in town. Instead of administering first aid, or rushing me to the emergency room, she started praying over my wound, and didn't let me get the aid kit myself. My only luck is that my parents came home earlier than expected. As you can imagine, my mother was furious, and didn't let her watch over me, or my younger brother again. She also blames me for my visual impairment, saying that I wouldn't need glasses if I believed in God more.

You can imagine I'm not overly found of her. Our relationship got even more strained when she moved to our house. Me and my mom try our hardest to be respectful and tolerant of her, but she is making it extremely hard. Everytime I happen to be in same room as her, she tells me to drop out (I'm in my final year of MA, no way I'm doing that), that I should just find myself a husband and have kids. Now, that wouldn't be such a big deal for most, but this comment of hers is really grinding my nerves. A, I'm openly AroAce, and B, I'm medically infertile. She knows this, but still believes that God will heal my infertility.

Now, getting to the point. For my 25 birthday I invited my family to our favorite restaurant for a dinner. And, of course, I had to invite her too. As soon as we sat down, she immediately started hounding me about marriage and kids. For hour straight. My mom tried to make her stop, so did my maternal grandmother and my father. Not only She didn't stop, she even got staff involved with her comments. I told her if she doesn't stop, I will have her kicked out. She didn't. So I kicked her out. I had my father drive her home and then return to us in the restaurant.

So, AITA for kicking my grandmother out, and not talking to her unless I absolutely need to?

Edit: A little cultural background. In Slavic culture, family values are basically ""put on the pedestal"". Especially in rural regions. Multigenerational houses are not uncommon outside of bigger cities, and most families prefer to take care of their elders instead of putting them in retirement houses.

52,1fpvuha,AITA For not waking my partner up for their work-event today?,"Context: My partner (27F) and I (28M) live together; this week as a whole has been stressful for both of us. Event happened this morning. Throwaway since Reddit Household.

I've been with my partner for almost 3 years. It's had ups and downs, but we both love each-other dearly. Earlier this week, she was dealing with some medical issues that caused her to be late to work. When we talked about it further, she addressed that her not waking up in a timely manner caused a lot of time-strife on her side. She was able to be excused for her morning activities with a doctor's note; this is a frequent occurrence in our home. She'll have something that she, critically, needs to be there early for.

My work requires I'm up early to handle items that come up through the day, so I'm happy to pack her lunch/make breakfast (if she's in the mood) and ensure her items are packed for the day. This week has been stressful - a lot of events/plans that I had to commit to for work. Since I have today off (still doing a small amount of work, but not going to the office), I wanted to sleep in a bit.

Last night, her and I discussed her plans for today - she had to go to a work function and leave very early in the morning. I told her that I would try to make sure she was good to go.

This morning, I tried to wake her up twice. Gently at first, then again with a bit more of a push (nothing like ripping bed-covers off or anything. More just a firmer shoulder rub and a few ""good morning; you awake?"")

After the 2nd attempt, I flipped back over - wanting to get a bit of sleep before trying again. Before that, she flipped to me and told me that ""You suck at doing this"" and ""Why didn't you get me up earlier"". All in, she had about 30ish minutes to get ready and head out.

Since I was tired, I chose to just not engage. I've learned that sometimes, me just shutting up solves some displaced frustrations. After getting up and thinking on it a bit, I feel a bit like an ass. We had discussed me making she was up - at the same time, just yesterday, she told me that her sleeping in was becoming problematic for her work-involvement.

I plan to talk with her today about it, when she gets back, to see where she feels the wrong happened.

Shortly after moving in it was clear she had a lot of issues and was constantly bringing drama and negativity into my life and i knew i needed to move out as soon as I could. It resulted in me eventually leaving our joint tenancy which she was not happy about at first but after lots of negotiation with our landlords we figured out a way for me to leave without it financially affecting her. we both shared some words in frustration but as far as i was concerned things ended on a civil note. 

When my bf and I got a place, about a month in he surprised me with a calico kitten. He had seen one that reminded him of my calico that i’ve had since childhood which lives at home with my parents. I posted a picture of her on my ig and Ashley responded saying “she’s literally (her cats name) lol”. I didn’t know how to interpret that so i said “haha right”. 

Flash forward about a month to last night when I wake up around 12:30am to a paragraph from Ashley saying she was thinking about me recently and hopes i’ve been settling in to my new apartment and to my new job. she goes on to say she thinks its “very weird” that i bought a cat similar to hers after moving out. I responded clarifying that it was a gift and i had no say in the breed & that I already own a calico which lives at my parent house. her response was that by me getting defensive it proves i know its strange.

Can someone please tell me if they would be offended if someone did that to them. I genuinely never saw a problem with it and I never thought to reach out to her and “check” if that would be ok or how she would feel.

56,1fpv5qw,WIBTA if I took 5 dollars out of my exes account every day,"Edit: before you comment, please understand that the bank WILL NOT ALLOW me to make changes to the joint account without him signing off on it. I cant just take myself off the account. They won't let me. It's what ive been trying to do for a week now. I understand some banks do things differently, i don't know why. I also have no control over the restrictions the bank decides to enforce.
  
  
Situation is; we had a joint account together, then we broke up. He paid me out, and we agreed the account would be his but he needed to either;
   
A: Take me off the account.
  
   
Or
  
  
B: Close the account and open a new one so my name was not on it.
  
  
But here's the thing; my ex is painfully lazy. Like, leaves dirty dishes in the sink for weeks until there are no more dishes to eat off of then puts the dishes away with dried food stuck to them after i beg him to help me clean lazy. So naturally he hasn't done anything about getting my name off the account. It's been a month now. So, I (as usual) had to take initiative and do it myself. At the beginning of the week I got a banker to send an email to him notifying him to go into his bank account and sign a secure document to take me off the account. Literally did all the work for him (one big whopping phone call), and the rest is so easy.
  
  
He has ignored it and done nothing. I've followed up with him twice now with no response. So the only thing I can think to do at this point would be to start making having my name on this account have negative consequences for him. Since I still have access to the account I was thinking of taking out some unsubstantial amount of money  every day until he removes my name from the account, then venmo it back to him once it's done. I'm thinking like somewhere between 1-5 dollars. If i do this I'll probabbly wait til after his rent is paid so he doesn't suffer any serious consequences.
  
  
I don't know how legal this is, but I'm sick to death of dealing with him and I'm at the end of my rope. I also seriously don't want my finances connected with him anymore.

  
  
So, WIBTA?
  
  
Edit: to clarify a few points...
  
-the goal is not to take his money and keep it, it's to scare him a bit and make him realize that both of us are in a tenuous position; not just me, then give him his money back. 
  
  
-Yes, I've communicated with him about this extensively both verbally and through text. He's just ignoring me now. 
  
  
-My biggest concern is that he will overdraft the account due to his online shopping problems and that will impact my personal checking account which is currently attached to it. 
  
  
-Yes I've communicated with the bank about trying to take myself off the account without his involvement. Originally they were going to require us to both be physically present in the bank at the same time to do this, and I had to explain that we live hundreds of miles apart before they would agree to do this electronically.

I'd probabbly still have to take all the money out and give it to him the same way I would by doing this, though. I'm not trying to spite him, I'm just trying to look out for myself.",Not enough info,2024-09-26,"WIBTA if I took 5 dollars out of my exes account every day Edit: before you comment, please understand that the bank WILL NOT ALLOW me to make changes to the joint account without him signing off on it. I cant just take myself off the account. They won't let me. It's what ive been trying to do for a week now. I understand some banks do things differently, i don't know why. I also have no control over the restrictions the bank decides to enforce.
  
  
Situation is; we had a joint account together, then we broke up. He paid me out, and we agreed the account would be his but he needed to either;
   
A: Take me off the account.
  
   
Or
  
  
B: Close the account and open a new one so my name was not on it.
  
  
But here's the thing; my ex is painfully lazy. Like, leaves dirty dishes in the sink for weeks until there are no more dishes to eat off of then puts the dishes away with dried food stuck to them after i beg him to help me clean lazy. So naturally he hasn't done anything about getting my name off the account. It's been a month now. So, I (as usual) had to take initiative and do it myself. At the beginning of the week I got a banker to send an email to him notifying him to go into his bank account and sign a secure document to take me off the account. Literally did all the work for him (one big whopping phone call), and the rest is so easy.
  
  
He has ignored it and done nothing. I've followed up with him twice now with no response. So the only thing I can think to do at this point would be to start making having my name on this account have negative consequences for him. Since I still have access to the account I was thinking of taking out some unsubstantial amount of money  every day until he removes my name from the account, then venmo it back to him once it's done. I'm thinking like somewhere between 1-5 dollars. If i do this I'll probabbly wait til after his rent is paid so he doesn't suffer any serious consequences.
  
  
I don't know how legal this is, but I'm sick to death of dealing with him and I'm at the end of my rope. I also seriously don't want my finances connected with him anymore.

  
  
So, WIBTA?
  
  
Edit: to clarify a few points...
  
-the goal is not to take his money and keep it, it's to scare him a bit and make him realize that both of us are in a tenuous position; not just me, then give him his money back. 
  
  
-Yes, I've communicated with him about this extensively both verbally and through text. He's just ignoring me now. 
  
  
-My biggest concern is that he will overdraft the account due to his online shopping problems and that will impact my personal checking account which is currently attached to it. 
  
  
-Yes I've communicated with the bank about trying to take myself off the account without his involvement. Originally they were going to require us to both be physically present in the bank at the same time to do this, and I had to explain that we live hundreds of miles apart before they would agree to do this electronically.

57,1fpv0oa,AITA for intervening in confrontation my partner started with Uber driver?,"My [32F] new fiancé [33M] went out for a lovely dinner last night. My fiancé is a wonderful man, but does get a little hot headed, especially after a few drinks. 

When we finished our meal, I called an Uber and from the beginning, he and the driver didn’t like each other. I accidentally kicked over something on the floor of the car while getting in, which the driver reached behind his to fix. He happened to reach near the box we had from the restaurant to fix it, which prompted my fiancé to demand “what are you doing?” in a clearly agitated voice. The driver explained what had happened, and I apologized for kicked over the item. 

When we got back to the house, my fiancé told me that he was going to let the driver know that his GPS directions were too loud. Knowing the tense interaction between them earlier, I insisted that he not do this, and that we just go home. But as the driver parked, he started saying this anyway, not getting out of the car. At this point, I am aware that he’s drunk, so I walk around to his side and pull him out of the car. He’s still arguing with the driver. He and the driver, who has rolled down his window, keep yelling at each other. I ask the driver to please leave and apologize for my fiance’s behavior — he truly was the instigator in the situation. Finally, the driver pulls off.

When we get inside, my fiancé confronts me, angry that I hadn’t just let him “talk it out” with the driver. I felt it was my responsibility to de-escalate the situation since he was clearly drunk and not making the best decisions, but he thinks this was a situation between men that he wanted to handle and that by intervening, I disrespected him. He told a friend who agrees with him, accusing me of acting more like his mom than partner. Also, this incident happened on my account, so if the driver gives us a low passenger rating, it will affect only me!

I was feeling under the weather (I moved to a high-altitude city, and I am getting winded very easily, and the dry air is also making me cough. I am waiting for my new humidifier to arrive). My mom has a habit of being very well-meaning but also very... insistent that if she feels something should be done, it not only needs to be done, but needs to happen immediately. Once, I changed eye doctors, and she yelled at me for taking too long to find a new one because ""you could go blind! You're gambling with your vision!""

So I told her, look mom, I feel under the weather, but not dangerously ill right now, and I also don't have insurance. If I feel worse or if it isn't better after a few days, I'll go to the doctor. But this wasn't good enough for her, and she kept telling me I never listen to her and go to the doctor when she tells me to.

About a month ago he asked me about being a reference for all his police interviews and I told him I’d have no problem providing a reference, as I’ve always known him as the hardest worker I ever knew. I thought he would be a great fit for the job personally, as he grew up (and still is) and athlete, was highly achieving in his sports, and always took on a leadership role. He was similar to me in the sense that he was very confident, and wasn’t afraid of voicing his opinions to whoever, whenever. (He is still the most confident, and hardest worker I still know and I have nothing but respect for him).
Not long ago I got a call from the Police interview team about my friend and I answer their questions as truthfully as I can, seeing as they have all my background info too, and they must’ve talked a bunch with my friend, I figure honesty is the best policy because I have full trust he’ll get the job anyway. During the convo I’m asked about his high school days in sports and if he was vocal or not.

64,1fpsg2m,AITA for telling a friend I don’t need Ozempic?,"UPDATE:
After reading through a ton of these comments I reached out to Hannah and asked to call. We spoke on the phone and I apologized for hurting her feelings and explained that I was not trying to call her fat and simply don’t feel comfortable discussing weight loss in that way. I also reminded her that I am in recovery from anorexia so I am meant to be gaining weight per my recovery program. Before I could go on she broke down crying and apologized for how she reacted. She said that her boyfriend (known douchebag) had been making a lot of not nice comments about her weight and had compared her to me, saying that I had “the ideal body type.” I encouraged her strongly to breakup with him. She said she really wants to. I then said while I can’t go on a weight loss journey with her I am definitely happy to be her hiking/yoga/spin buddy and she was really into the idea. Like I thought, she didn’t know how serious Ozempic is and how expensive it is. We both agreed that her weight gain is mostly due to the stress of her relationship and I think she is moving forward in a positive direction. Thank you for all the kind comments 💖

This is a fight between me (23F) and my friend Hannah (23F). For context I am quite short and skinny. Like if I lost 5 - 10 more pounds I would look sickly. Hannah is about a foot taller than me and has gained some weight in recent years.

Hannah and I regularly go out to eat together. I know that she is unhappy with her weight but I have never made a comment about it because it’s none of my business and because I don’t like to encourage diet talk as someone with a former eating disorder.

Last week the two of us were getting dinner and Hannah was super jazzed up because she had just discovered what Ozempic is (don’t ask me how she hadn’t heard about it before). She was talking about it and jokingly said, “We could do it together, it’d be like a fun bonding activity!”

I responded, not jokingly because I don’t like to make jokes about weight, “I’m okay, I’m already quite slender as is.” I didn’t think much about it but later Hannah texted me saying that she was mad about the comment and that I was a dick for calling her fat. From my perspective I was trying to state a fact and just get out of talking about weight loss. AITAH?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-26,"AITA for telling a friend I don’t need Ozempic? UPDATE:

We spoke on the phone and I apologized for hurting her feelings and explained that I was not trying to call her fat and simply don’t feel comfortable discussing weight loss in that way. I also reminded her that I am in recovery from anorexia so I am meant to be gaining weight per my recovery program. Before I could go on she broke down crying and apologized for how she reacted. She said that her boyfriend (known douchebag) had been making a lot of not nice comments about her weight and had compared her to me, saying that I had “the ideal body type.” I encouraged her strongly to breakup with him. She said she really wants to. I then said while I can’t go on a weight loss journey with her I am definitely happy to be her hiking/yoga/spin buddy and she was really into the idea. Like I thought, she didn’t know how serious Ozempic is and how expensive it is. We both agreed that her weight gain is mostly due to the stress of her relationship and I think she is moving forward in a positive direction. Thank you for all the kind comments 💖

This is a fight between me (23F) and my friend Hannah (23F). For context I am quite short and skinny. Like if I lost 5 - 10 more pounds I would look sickly. Hannah is about a foot taller than me and has gained some weight in recent years.

Hannah and I regularly go out to eat together. I know that she is unhappy with her weight but I have never made a comment about it because it’s none of my business and because I don’t like to encourage diet talk as someone with a former eating disorder.

Last week the two of us were getting dinner and Hannah was super jazzed up because she had just discovered what Ozempic is (don’t ask me how she hadn’t heard about it before). She was talking about it and jokingly said, “We could do it together, it’d be like a fun bonding activity!”

I responded, not jokingly because I don’t like to make jokes about weight, “I’m okay, I’m already quite slender as is.” I didn’t think much about it but later Hannah texted me saying that she was mad about the comment and that I was a dick for calling her fat.

65,1fpsetl,AITA for calling my fiancé out for interrupting me ALL THE TIME,"I'm on my phone so apologies if something is weird.

 But basically as the title says, my fiancé has a REALLY bad habit of interrupting people, not just me but mostly me because it seems he's the most comfortable with it, and he tries to be the ""model husband"" when guest are around. That's not speculation, he's said it himself, that he'll act differently because he ""doesn't want my family to see him in a negative light"". My mom just visited and I can honestly say it was one of the VERY few times in our relationship that he didn't interrupt me, because(in his paraphrased words) ""Your mom is different than my mom, I have to be on my best behavior for your mom so she's sure I treat you right"" 

But I went on vacation yesterday to see my brother's retirement ceremony(20+ years in the Army/whole family came) and I want to be VERY clear that I wanted him to come and tried my damnest to do so. He couldn't. He still tries to guilt me with the whole ""You're abandoning me! How will i live for a week? You should've had the cermeony here."" He said these were jokes but he was the only one laughing. It would've been his first time meeting my whole family(it's large) and our first actual vacation together. Needless to say, I really wanted him to come and am disappointed he couldn't but that's adult life. I called him today to talk and vent a lil about the family issues. And my biggest problem is that he'll ask me a question, and then interrupt when I'm halfway through answering. And it's not always topic related, sometimes(tho not this time) he'll bring up something random after asking me a question and it just feels like he doesn't actually care about my answer. But when I bring it up he gives me ""oh my god, I can't even talk to you without you getting upset"" when I feel like I'm just trying to speak uninterrupted, especially when he asked me a question. So when I said something on the phone today he got pissed and was like ""I've wasted an hour of my life talking about interrupting, I get it, you should go to bed""(he always says he gets it and then interrupts me again) and I was a little snippy when I said ""I'm sorry that talking to your fiancée about something you continuously do that bothers her makes you feel like you wasted an hour of your life"" And he did his whole ""omg I can't"" thing again and I'm left feeling like the bad guy when I can't even talk to my fiancé about things that bother me without him telling me I'm overreacting or being dramatic.

","My bf (M23) and I (F22) are a part of a common group of friends, and one person in this group has put me down since the day that I’ve met her. Let’s call her Regina, for obvious reasons. Regina is always mean to me and it’s always uncalled for. Examples include casually saying “you disgust me” when I laugh too loud, or “shut the fuck up” when I wasn’t even talking to her in particular. So whenever we are in a group setting I avoid engaging too much with her. I say hello and smile but spend the rest of my time being with others. This hasn’t made her stop though. She still inserts herself into my conversations with others and degrades me. Nobody ever asks her to stop. She says these are ""jokes"" but they're always directed only at me.

Usually I ignore this stuff just like everyone else but today she crossed the line. I’ve recently lost a lot of weight (in a good way) but that’s caused my breast size to go down by a lot. While I was talking in a group chat about a new dress I bought to another friend, Regina said “it won’t look good because of your deflated tits ”. It just shattered me. I had to say something because I was seething. I don’t like to appearance-shame anyone but Regina is objectively the most unattractive person in the group (collective opinion, not just mine). So I said “Who gave you the right to comment on my body? No wonder you’ve always been single. Your personality is uglier than you are”. She kept throwing insults at me after this.

Nobody else replied in the group chat. I was expecting my boyfriend to say something to her about how this is not okay. When I called him and asked him to defend me on the group he said i was being unfair by dragging him into this and that I “should be brave enough” to fight my own battles. I said “you’re okay with me getting bullied?” And his reply was “cmon you know it’s all in good fun. If you don’t like it then handle it yourself”. I was stunned. We’ve been together for 3 years now and it’s not like he’s good friends with Regina. I said I don’t want to talk to him anymore unless he decides to defend me.

68,1fps3x3,AITA for not keeping my flat extremely clean?,"I moved into a flat share 6 months ago. The flat was already pretty gross looking when I moved in, a bit old and run down, not so clean looking walls, etc. But I needed a place, and the housing market is very competitive where I live so I just went for it. 

The landlord keeps popping in unannounced at random times with new potential tenants, to make repairs, etc. He doesn’t tell us he’s coming in. It’s just me and another tenant right now and we’re both extremely busy so while we try to keep the common areas pretty clean, sometimes a bit of mess piles up and it doesn’t look spotless. To add to that, it’s not a very nice renovated flat so even at its cleanest, it doesn’t look very clean. 

I try to clean the kitchen every two, three days for reference. My flatmate doesn’t clean much at all, it seems, so add that for context. 

A few weeks ago, the landlord came in unannounced again and complained that our flat was messy. He paid for a cleaner to come and she did a very surface level clean for us. He said to make sure we keep it that way. Now he’s come in again and complained that it was back to its original state. I tried to explain that I work 6/7 days a week and am doing my best but if he needs to do something like bring in a potential client he can give us a 24 hour notice and we’ll deep clean. I just haven’t had time for that in the last few weeks to be thorough. 

AITA? I find it a bit strange that he can waltz in here at any time.

She needs to talk all the time and the thing is when she talks, she always interrupts people, she nods all the time and she also copies what you just said. Another thing is that our teacher is going for a run early every morning. He asked if anyone would like to join him and she obviosly said yes, because she’s also a massive teachers pet. So she’s probably going to get up so early in the mornings. And neither my friend and I have a good mood in the morning. 

The problem is that we don’t know any other people on this trip. We don’t have any other friends in this group that we can say we want to share the room with instead. We have no good excuses at all for this. The teachers need to know a reason why we don’t want to share a room with her but we obviosly don’t have one. Please help us, we are desperate!",1.0,1.0601516,1,1

So far it has been small disagreements that are frustrating, but nothing big, not until last week.

 All of our friends have a class together, so we all had the same paper due at the same time, so Vee and I were in our room working on the paper and Cea went to a different friend's room (Tea). After a while of working on our papers we took a break and took the trash out, while we were walking back we remarked on how close Tea's window was. We completely forgot that Cea was in Tea's room, so we went and knocked on Tea's window to scare him a little, think ding dong ditching but the window. It was supposed to be a funny little joke that we would tell him in the morning and would all laugh about it. 

Once we got done with the papers, we went and knocked on the window again, but this time we were going to feign ignorance and ask him about it and pretend it was happening to us too. When we went to talk to Tea about it we realized that Cea was in there and she was freaking out about it. She was talking about going to our campus safety about the situation because (we didn't know about this) last year there was someone who was peeping into windows that had to be dealt with by the campus safety. 

Obviously, we didn't want to be reported, so we confessed. Cea did not take this well. She got pissed at us immediately, saying how we are terrible people and how fucked up what we did was. We didn't even realize she was still in the room. We apologized that she wasn't meant to get caught up in it and we never meant anything mean-spirited by it. By the way, Tea didn't care, once he found out it was us he thought it was super funny. 

After we were done apologizing we mentioned how if she were there with us to scare him, she would have found it as funny as we did. She hated that we would even think that of her (she would have ate that up). After she left the room in anger we talked to Tea and some other friends who all agreed that she would have been fine with doing that to him with us, despite her protestations. Anyways, she has been hating us since and we think she might report us, even though we didn't mean to have her mixed up in this prank. So AITA for unintentionally scaring the crap out of our roommate?

EDIT: To clear some things up, Cea did not go here when the creep incident happened. She only found out about last year after we knocked on Tea’s window.

Or at least they have tried/wanted to. But it hasn't worked out that way. My sister's daughter had a pretty awful father and he died when she was a baby. My sister's defended a lot from him until she'd had enough 5 months into her pregnancy and left. So she's not known for making the best decisions all the time, even with support and she had a lot of it. Her husband's kids don't know their mom but she's alive and out there somewhere but doesn't want to know them.

I'm not entirely sure how long my sister and her husband were together before they got married but around 2 years would be my guess.

Anyway, it was pretty clear pre-wedding that her husband's kids were not happy at the idea of blending families. They always seemed so hostile when talking to my sister or any of us (me, parents, other siblings). They would glare at my sister's daughter for no reason other than she was in their line of sight. At the wedding they kept moving away from everyone and were saying mean things to my sister's daughter when they were asked to sit or stand together. When corrected they would tell whoever to shut up. They also never want to play with the other kids in our family, even the kids the same age as them.

In the time my sister and her husband have been married, my niece has heard that nobody wants her, that the kids would rather die than sit next to her at dinner, that she's not their sibling and they hate her, that her stepsiblings would rather be grounded than be in the car at the same time as her, that they'd rather be punished than pass her something (say she wants the salt or whatever). It happens when they're out too. I was with them once and the oldest said he was not sitting next to her. Looked very disgusted at the very idea of it. They also try to say she smells bad. They act like the other is being punished when sitting next to her. They'll even turn their backs to her and shut her out that way.

I started asking my sister if her daughter could come to play with my friends and my wife and I have loved having her. She comes once or twice a week now and she always wants to come more. My sister is starting to get annoyed by it. And she asked me yesterday why her daughter is always so eager to be at my house and why she'd rather be at my house than home. I told her it's because her household is dysfunctional and she has been repeatedly reminded two people don't want her there and actively go out of their way to hurt her feelings. I said no kid wants that. She asked me how I could judge and then told me it's really none of my business to comment like that. I reminded her that she asked. She shut down and stormed off.

He asked me who someone was in my DMs, and I told him, even explaining what the conversation was about. He asked me to block that person, and I did.

This morning (he was staying at my place), we woke up with his alarm, and while we were cuddling in bed, he opened Instagram. He has notifications turned off only for Instagram, so when he opened it, a DM popped up on the screen. He immediately swiped the DM away, so I asked him who it was. He said, ""I don’t know,"" and locked his phone. I told him he could check, but he said he didn’t want to. I asked again because, at that point, it felt weird to me, and then he got up and started packing his stuff to leave, even though we still had some time before he needed to go.

I told him that his reaction seemed odd, and then he started calling me a freak and a weirdo. I know this is more of a personal issue I need to work on, about feeling insecure with my partner. But what really threw me off was his reaction. If he wanted to set boundaries, he could have just talked about it in a mature way, and I would have understood. I wasn’t asking to see the conversation; I was just asking, “Who is it?”—which shouldn’t be a big deal in a relationship, right?

He ended up leaving and later texted me that he won’t talk to me until I apologize and admit it’s 100% my fault.

So he blew up and proceeded to insult the burgers (even tho they were just meat and cheese and he's the kinda guy who orders fried rice with no veggies....) and insult me by calling me white (I'm not) and then randomly went on a rant about how I'm too much of a liberal? He claimed I never invite him to things but literally every time I tried he was either at work or his wife wouldn't let him (and that's an entire other topic...). So he decided then and there to end a 13 year long friendship and hasn't responded to the ground chat and left out discord server. On one hand I miss my friend a bunch but on the other hand if he has the emotional intelligence of a toddler and this is how he truly feels then I guess there's really nothing I can do about it? Idk. John and I feel like we did nothing wrong but Ray and obviously Jay think I'm absolute scum. ",0.0,0.981243,1,0
81,1fpqdks,AITA for telling my sister she’s an ableist b?,"So I, 16M and my sister, 19F normally got along, but recently we’ve been having more fights about useless things. 
like one day my sister asked if i ate her popsicles in a very annoyed and accusing tone. i didn’t eat them but she kept going on about how they’re missing and i’m the only other person who likes them. i didn’t eat them, but i felt like i needed to defend myself since she was accusing me. 
anyway, a few days ago, me and my sister were playing games together when she noticed i was drinking a juice box. she asked where i got it, and i told her that mom gave it to me.

 she said that those were her juice boxes when they weren’t. she keeps hers in her room and on her section of the food cabinet, and i watched my mom get the juice boxes from HER room. but my sister didn’t like that answer and started accusing me of taking her juice boxes since my mom wouldn’t have any in her room. i told her that if she was unsure, she should call her snd ask her, instead of accusing me. she then said that i should be defensive if i didn’t take them, but again, shes accusing me so ofc i’m gonna defend myself. 

she then starts calling me names and saying i’m stupid. i told her i’m not stupid. 
she says quote; “oh yeah? if you’re not stupid then why do you have to go to a special school with special kids?” 

that really hurt me since i have autism and severe agoraphobia and generalized anxiety disorder so much so i cant go to a regular school. i also have other challenges such as memory issues and Dyscalculia. (math disability) i told her that she shouldn’t say that and it isn’t my fault that my anxiety is so bad that i physically cant go. 

she then tells me that i’m stupid once again and that since shes in collage, and taking psychology, that anxiety cant physically stop me from going in, because its mental not physical.
I told her yes it can because i’ve had many anxiety / panic attacks with shaking, hyperventilating and nausea unless those were “in my head.”

she glared at me and said “you’re so stupid, you don’t know anything, you don’t even get grades and barely know anything since you’re so “special.”
thats when i lost it and told her shes being ableist and a bitch all because she believes i took her stupid juice box. i called my mom and told her what happened, but all she got was a slight talking to about only the juice box and nothing else she said about me. 
we currently are ignoring each other.

and just to clarify, she said all of this in a very accusatory and annoyed tone, so that’s why i also felt threatened.
so, AITA?

82,1fpqct7,AITA for never lending my friend money again?,"This is a long one, my apologies.



So, I have a friend, his fake name is John. John and I have been friends for a long, long time, since the early days of school.  Life happened and we moved away from each other, but kept in sporadic contact over FB.

I hear eventually that John is not doing great. He's gotten some really bad habits. I try to support him by being there as much as he allows me, and eventually he started getting a bit better, getting out of his habits, as far as I could see.



Last year, he asks to borrow some cash. I have a simple rule: if you don't pay me back, you can't borrow money again until you do. I lend him money and tell him to give back when he can. He does, all is well. He asks another time to borrow money, and I tell him the same thing. 

Several months goes by and he pops up again, asking for money. I tell him he still hasn't paid me back from last time. He's surprised to hear that, having apparently forgotten, and then tells me ""why didn't you remind me?""

""Because you're an adult, John, I figured you could keep track of your own finances.""

He goes silent and doesn't bring it up again. He does pay me back eventually for that, so no issue.



Here's the issue:



Last week, Wednesday, he asks to borrow money. It's a sizeable amount but not alarmingly so. He tells me he'll give it back Thursday. Okay, a bit strange he'll give it back that fast but he's made strange excuses and stories before about his money lending needs (and I'm sure I don't want to know more, ignorance is bliss), so I lend him the money.



Thursday comes... and goes. No John. No money.

I poke him and prod him Friday morning, and he answers eventually with a dumb excuse about being sick, having to attend a birthday party the next day (despite being sick, as one does), and even fishes for sympathy. I tell him to pay me back and keep his promise. He promises to give me the cash next Thursday.



I was not happy. I don't care whether you borrow 5 bucks or 500, if you make a promise, you keep it and you don't run circles around me.

I find out soon after that John asked the same of my mother. Now, she's older and smarter than me, so she only lent him a small amount, but an amount no less.

That means, unless he blew a significant amount of money on the most expensive antibiotics known to man, he would've had enough cash to pay me back on the promised day, according to the information he has given me.



Credit where it's due, he paid me the other day, the full amount, before the deadline but only because my mother poked him about the cash he owed her.



I have decided to never lend him a bent dime ever again, because he broke his promise. I talked about this to a few friends, just letting out steam to some people who don't know John, but several of them are telling me I'm being too harsh, that it was just a one-time screw-up and I should give him the benefit of the doubt.

He lives about 90 miles away and travels to me exclusively. I can’t stay with him for several reasons. I work full-time from home and have one child I’m solely responsible for.

I was raised to be a good host, and so when people are in my home I tend to cook for them and clean up after them, and have done so for him for most of our relationship so far.

When he comes to my house he usually stays for 1-2 weeks at a time and then only goes to his home for a few days to a week at most.

When he’s at my home, I provide almost all of the food he eats and prepare almost all of his meals. He has chipped in here and there in the past, and he does usually bring a jar of peanut butter and a loaf of bread for himself to snack on (neither me nor my child eat it). He also will occasionally microwave something or throw something into the air fryer from the freezer if I ask him to.

I told him a few months ago I’d like for him to help out more while he’s at my home because with the frequency that he stays it’s practically like he lives with me and only visits his hometown. 

He’s pretty good about helping out when I specifically ask, but otherwise is content to walk past messes (whether he contributed to them or not) unless I say something.

I work 10 hr days and will often cook a full dinner while juggling work. I buy mostly organic foods, and prepare almost everything we eat from scratch.

I said that with the amount of money and time I spend on the meals he eats the least he can do is load my kids dishes into the dishwasher and run it, and that’s if I have to ask him to do every task then I might as well just ask him to leave.

87,1fppqqa,"AITA for pulling a ""prank"" on my now ex-best friend?","I (17F) & my ex-best friend who we'll call Amy (16F), have not spoken to each other for three months. Idk why. Some things happened over the last three years that I should have picked up on, like how she would leave me on delivered for 3 or more hours , or cancel the day we were supposed to hang out. The worst thing she had done was text me an hour before I was supposed to walk the stage at my highschool graduation; she wasn't able to come because she didn't have a ride, even though I had offered her one since I had gotten her a ticket & she lived 5 minutes away from my house. 

After my grad, we ended up only sending snaps and not talking. Any time I wanted to hang out over the summer she would respond to me with a Snap of her shoulder or wall, only once told me she was busy with summer school (3 hours) & driving school (2 hours). I only know how long they were because she had done summer school last year & I had done driving school. Eventually out of anger I blocked her phone number, unfollowed her Instagram account, & deleted all photos of her. I did not block her snap because our streak was really close to 1,000 & I thought maybe by then we would have communicated & resolved the issue, I was wrong. 

I also have a friend who we'll call Bianca (16F), who I had introduced Amy to 2 years ago. I told Bianca about my situation with Amy & later found out Amy was doing the same thing to her. We were confused because nothing had changed in our relationship. School started 3 weeks ago, I'm a freshman in uni & Bianca/Amy are juniors in hs &, now Amy started snapping me like everything is fine & normal and the three months didn't count.I told Bianca & asked her if Amy is doing the same. She said yes, but didn't answer cuz she doesn't like people being fake like that, very understandable. Two weeks ago I get a snap text from Amy- which I halfswipe her cuz I no longer care- & asked me if I blocked her phone number. I don't want to lie, so I say ""yes, you haven't spoken to me in 3 months."" How does Amy respond? She doesn't.

 The following Sunday, Bianca and I decide to hang out, & after eating we went for a drive, so we head to my neighbourhood since I know those roads well. Bianca & I thought it would be funny if we went in front of Amy's house & just blasted some music, see if she would come out, maybe say hi. We end up in front of her house, playing the best song known to man... Temperature by Sean Paul- which also is an inside joke- & Amy's sister & dad walk out of their open garage so we wave 'hi' to Amy's sister & nothing... After 2 circles around her house, we go our separate ways & head home. Once I got home I get a text from Amy on Snap, I half-swipe, & she said (verbatim) ""hey can you like get a hobby"". A day goes by & she blocked me. This happened 4 days ago, so it's still super fresh, & I want to know if what I did was super bad.

I (17F) & my ex-best friend who we'll call Amy (16F), have not spoken to each other for three months. Idk why. Some things happened over the last three years that I should have picked up on, like how she would leave me on delivered for 3 or more hours , or cancel the day we were supposed to hang out. The worst thing she had done was text me an hour before I was supposed to walk the stage at my highschool graduation; she wasn't able to come because she didn't have a ride, even though I had offered her one since I had gotten her a ticket & she lived 5 minutes away from my house. 

After my grad, we ended up only sending snaps and not talking. Any time I wanted to hang out over the summer she would respond to me with a Snap of her shoulder or wall, only once told me she was busy with summer school (3 hours) & driving school (2 hours). I only know how long they were because she had done summer school last year & I had done driving school. Eventually out of anger I blocked her phone number, unfollowed her Instagram account, & deleted all photos of her. I did not block her snap because our streak was really close to 1,000 & I thought maybe by then we would have communicated & resolved the issue, I was wrong. 

I also have a friend who we'll call Bianca (16F), who I had introduced Amy to 2 years ago. I told Bianca about my situation with Amy & later found out Amy was doing the same thing to her. We were confused because nothing had changed in our relationship. School started 3 weeks ago, I'm a freshman in uni & Bianca/Amy are juniors in hs &, now Amy started snapping me like everything is fine & normal and the three months didn't count.I told Bianca & asked her if Amy is doing the same. She said yes, but didn't answer cuz she doesn't like people being fake like that, very understandable. Two weeks ago I get a snap text from Amy- which I halfswipe her cuz I no longer care- & asked me if I blocked her phone number. I don't want to lie, so I say ""yes, you haven't spoken to me in 3 months."" How does Amy respond? She doesn't.

 The following Sunday, Bianca and I decide to hang out, & after eating we went for a drive, so we head to my neighbourhood since I know those roads well. Bianca & I thought it would be funny if we went in front of Amy's house & just blasted some music, see if she would come out, maybe say hi. We end up in front of her house, playing the best song known to man... Temperature by Sean Paul- which also is an inside joke- & Amy's sister & dad walk out of their open garage so we wave 'hi' to Amy's sister & nothing... After 2 circles around her house, we go our separate ways & head home. Once I got home I get a text from Amy on Snap, I half-swipe, & she said (verbatim) ""hey can you like get a hobby"". A day goes by & she blocked me. This happened 4 days ago, so it's still super fresh, & I want to know if what I did was super bad. 

So, AITA?

88,1fppq5u,AITA for insisting my partner helps clean for an event at my place?,"AITA for insisting my partner helps clean for an event at my place?

A chef, who’s a friend of my partner, is organizing events where she cooks and entertains around 25 people. My partner has been helping her set this up, and the next event is happening at my apartment terrace in two days.

The chef is paying my partner a percentage of her earnings for using the terrace, but I’m not receiving anything for providing the space. In fact, if I want to join the dinner, I have to pay for my own food. I’m only supporting my partner’s projects because I want her to succeed.

This apartment isn’t well-maintained as it's merely used to sleep, and the terrace is rarely used if at all, so it needs a lot of cleaning.  
  
There was a prior event where I suggested my partner helps clean, and she got upset, saying that since it's my place, it's my responsibility and she's not a cleaning lady. I did a rough cleaning, then received complaints that it wasn't good, and she had to clean again. After the event, the chef proposed to hire a cleaning person and I declined since it would have taken money out of my partner's profits. I expected some help but didn't receive any.

Now, with the next event coming up, I plan to tell my partner I won’t clean unless she helps this time. I expect this will lead to another argument, but I feel it’s fair. I’m offering my space and support; I think we should share the workload.

So, basically, to give some background: My parents have always been sorta weirdly against me ever moving or just going somewhere away from home. Due to a variety of past events, I basically maintain zero trust in any of them now, if they hear anything from me it’s probably because I was impulsive and dying to tell someone.

Secondly, they have a major issue of somehow considering promises or vows or anything made by _me_ a gospel of truth, but backtracking on their own promises, vows, declarations, in like less than a second. I, for the love of god, can never trust myself to make a commitment as long as they are involved in my life: you never know when she’ll backtrack or cancel on something and _forbid_ me from doing it, or suddenly force me into doing something she wants me to do.

My parents, the last time I talked to them, were visibly uncomfortable at the prospect of my going to college to another country (if you think the international travel was the problem, they wouldn’t let me out of state either despite the fact my sisters have been allowed basically everywhere). My dad was like, I don’t even know how to explain it, weird. The deflection was insane, infuriating at times. You’re calling _Harvard_, a unnamed and unknown college? And even though I managed to convince them it was real- My parents trust strangers more than family, atleast more than me and my siblings. 

Harvard, in fact, has 100% financial aid for the income group that my family falls in. I admit, we aren’t rich by any means. But the financial aid: it basically means I can work as a TA part time at the university and college is completely free for me, housing and everything included. Yet he persisted, so I suggested that _I_ can pay for college myself: I have been building a pretty strong fund for myself since 6th-7th grade, which has grown to a reasonable size, because I _knew_ this would happen. Foresight, people. But as soon as I suggested it, every single adult in the room turned into a fucking angry zombie. Holy shit. And it felt like I had just suggested something taboo, like- Now, I’m not really a confident person who can stand up to everyone. I kinda crumble down easily, I can’t handle my emotions, I’m still learning. So like, I exited the room before I would implode into a sobbing mess (I kind of did, like my tear ducts do betray me at times).

For the past week, it’s been extremely weird doing anything involving my parents, that includes talking. I’ll be going back to school (which, thankfully, is located out-of-state, I’m only allowed to stay there because my cousin, same grade, also opted to go there. Big opportunity. Just wishing he doesn’t drop out or something), but I’m like, did I do something bad? Is it bad to suggest that to an adult as an effective child?

94,1fpodr8,AITAH for not helping my mom?,"Ok, so for starters i’m a 22M currently active duty military and i’m set to separate here shortly in 2 weeks. 

Throughout my time in, (4 years) I have helped my family back home. Family meaning my mother, my sister and my 3 younger brothers. By help, I mean I forked over thousands and thousands of dollars (I know it sounds bad.) The reason being that every time she asked me for help (money) was bc she was on the verge of being evicted multiple times or food was running out and she needed help to cover the cost of some groceries or wtv. Most recent being I gave her $3k to cover her late payments. She tells me she’s gonna pay me back and this and that but over the years I lent her money and i haven’t seen a single dime. In 2022, I took her car bc I was being stationed somewhere else in which that loan was in her name and I was making payments on it and she took another loan out for herself (ik dumb. I didn’t know how all this shit worked but i learned now). Well that car got fucked in an accident while i was deployed back in April so all the money i poured into it was for nothing. The insurance claims payed for it and GAP insurance saved my ass and payed off the rest of it. Recently they issued a backpay check to me for around $1500-$1600. I was going to use that to put toward my new car that I have now but my mom indirectly asked for it! Asked for that along with another $1500 to cover the late payments on her apt! 

Of course I gave it her. I hesitated so much, but the only thing I could think of was my siblings. If I had the money to help even though it would leave me with scraps and I get to eat at the chow hall here and have a roof over my head, but they don’t? I can’t live with that shit on my conscience bc they’re so young and they don’t understand and do not fucking deserve to be thrown on the street. I ask my friends here and my gf and they tell me the same thing. That I eventually have to put my foot down. My mom told me eventually she knows I won’t/can’t give anymore. I can’t even remember how much money i have lent her so far. Like i don’t even fucking live there and I’m paying her shit? That’s not fair. My sister doesn’t want to quit her dumbass waitress job and get another where she can collect a check and not depend on tips not to add that she doesn’t even help out according to my mom. Now that i type all this fucking shit out i realize im like a cow being milked for what i have. So there’s that. I don’t want to live back home. I don’t want to lend money out other than for myself anymore. I’m done. I feel so terrible that i think this way. All i can think of is my brothers. I don’t want them on the street but i can’t just give my money out when i have my own bills to worry about. I lose sleep over this everynight. I don’t wanna do this anymore. It doesn’t help im fucking depressed instead of excited that im separating (military guys/gals know) Im so lost. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-26,"AITAH for not helping my mom? Ok, so for starters i’m a 22M currently active duty military and i’m set to separate here shortly in 2 weeks. 

Throughout my time in, (4 years) I have helped my family back home. Family meaning my mother, my sister and my 3 younger brothers. By help, I mean I forked over thousands and thousands of dollars (I know it sounds bad.) The reason being that every time she asked me for help (money) was bc she was on the verge of being evicted multiple times or food was running out and she needed help to cover the cost of some groceries or wtv. Most recent being I gave her $3k to cover her late payments. She tells me she’s gonna pay me back and this and that but over the years I lent her money and i haven’t seen a single dime. In 2022, I took her car bc I was being stationed somewhere else in which that loan was in her name and I was making payments on it and she took another loan out for herself (ik dumb. I didn’t know how all this shit worked but i learned now). Well that car got fucked in an accident while i was deployed back in April so all the money i poured into it was for nothing. The insurance claims payed for it and GAP insurance saved my ass and payed off the rest of it. Recently they issued a backpay check to me for around $1500-$1600. I was going to use that to put toward my new car that I have now but my mom indirectly asked for it! Asked for that along with another $1500 to cover the late payments on her apt! 

Of course I gave it her. I hesitated so much, but the only thing I could think of was my siblings. If I had the money to help even though it would leave me with scraps and I get to eat at the chow hall here and have a roof over my head, but they don’t? I can’t live with that shit on my conscience bc they’re so young and they don’t understand and do not fucking deserve to be thrown on the street. I ask my friends here and my gf and they tell me the same thing. That I eventually have to put my foot down. My mom told me eventually she knows I won’t/can’t give anymore. I can’t even remember how much money i have lent her so far. Like i don’t even fucking live there and I’m paying her shit? That’s not fair. My sister doesn’t want to quit her dumbass waitress job and get another where she can collect a check and not depend on tips not to add that she doesn’t even help out according to my mom. Now that i type all this fucking shit out i realize im like a cow being milked for what i have. So there’s that. I don’t want to live back home. I don’t want to lend money out other than for myself anymore. I’m done. I feel so terrible that i think this way. All i can think of is my brothers. I don’t want them on the street but i can’t just give my money out when i have my own bills to worry about. I lose sleep over this everynight. I don’t wanna do this anymore. It doesn’t help im fucking depressed instead of excited that im separating (military guys/gals know) Im so lost. ",0.0,-0.0032178245,0,1

99,1fpnear,WIBTA for not going out with my friend anymore?,"I’ve (24f) have been friends with Heather (23f + fake name) for about 10 years. We’ve not argued about much, no major betrayals, and I would consider us close! 
Recently, I’ve been feeling a bit of awkwardness in the relationship and I’m not sure if I should confront it, ignore it, or a secret third option I can’t think of right now.
Heather doesn’t have a great deal of friends, she is more into having a few friends she’s close to whereas I have a large friend group throughout our city area. Heather is a chill girl who would prefer to be at home cozy with tea.
On the other hand, I’m a social butterfly. I work as a model in a major city and I spend a lot of time mingling and going to events.

Heather expressed interest in wanting to go out to clubs and bars more and I was more than happy to oblige. So within the last year, we’ve been visiting more events. Heather also expressed interest in finding a lover. I did tell her that a club or swanky industry event isn’t always the best place to look for romance but I’d keep my eyes peeled for cute guys. I have a boyfriend so I go out to see friends or something my agent sends me to, not for dating.

We’ve gone to a few events and at each one I’ve noticed her begin to act differently towards me. I’d see her far away from me in the club, and I’d walk up to her confused not knowing where she had went. Other times she looks frustrated. I thought the environment may be overwhelming and didn’t take it personal. I returned to mostly hanging with her in the daytime for brunch or nails but she asked me to go out again. I say yes, hoping that the last few times were just a fluke. 
I was wrong. The next few outings she acted like she wanted to go home, then finally blurted one night “why do all the guys walk up to you?” after I turned a guys drink offer down.
She tried to giggle it off but it was very obvious (to me at least) that she somewhat meant it. Or for example, after a group of guys walked passed me whistling and yelling for me (something that made me so uncomfortable) she said “oh please, don’t pretend you didn’t like it”. 
I wasn’t pretending.
The guys walking up to me are not men im interested in, and sometimes it boarders harassment. I cannot control when/if they walk up to me, If I could, I’d stop it personally. I’m not flattered by it. 
But I did sit back and think about the times I went out and how the guys were approaching me but not necessarily approaching her. I guess I did not notice because they read as CREEPS to me and inhibitors of my fun, I didn’t think it was a positive thing. I don’t even think HEATHER would like these guys even if they did approach her. 

I realized in that moment that it wasn’t about the quality of man speaking to me but it was that they were speaking to me at all. I understand what it’s like to feel ignored, overlooked, etc.. I empathize with heather.

100,1fpn6my,WIBTA if I gave my bf an ultimatum between me and his brother ,"
WIBTA by telling my boyfriend either his brother leaves or the baby and I stay somewhere else until his brother gets his shit together?   

Let me start by first explaining the living arrangements. We live in a two bedroom apartment, my partner (25M) and I (22F) sleep in one room with our 3month old baby. In the second room, is my partner’s brother. (23M) Said brother has had issues with xanax, lean, weed,etc in the past. It recently started up again and it’s gotten to the point where he’s missed work multiple times and he always comes up with some sort of excuse. We definitely don’t want that around our child and we definitely don’t need the stress of coming up with his portion of the rent because he decides to not show up for work. Mind you, he doesn’t own a car and literally has no bills except rent. When I was on maternity leave we asked him to pitch in for groceries which he agreed to but has yet to happen. With this being said, we HAVE had to deal with months where he doesn’t have rent but doesn’t tell us until the day we want to turn in the money order. My partner and I both agreed this is not something we want to stress about now that our baby is here.

In the past my partner has told him to quit it, to seek therapy, etc. but has never really held him accountable. That is up until this week. He sent him a text basically saying to stop acting like a little kid, to start acting his age and stop bringing drugs home especially when we’re home with the baby. He threatened to kick him out if he didn’t. At first, it seemed like he got through to him but we just found out he has started inhaling nitrous. My partner and I are just stuck on how to go about kicking him out. I feel like I don’t have much say since it’s not my brother but I really worry about the safety of my baby and don’t need this added stress. I’m so close to telling him he either tells him he already warned him and he clearly ignored it so it was time to go, or that the baby and I will stay elsewhere until his brother figures his shit out.

I of course dont want to cause any trouble in my relationship but I’ve literally been in the system before (CPS) and don’t want to even risk having our baby taken away cause boundaries aren’t being set. I’m just stuck and don’t know what to do. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-26,"WIBTA if I gave my bf an ultimatum between me and his brother

102,1fpn2ip,AITA for Moving Away from Toxic Family Members?,"TLDR: I moved away from toxic family members to live with my Dad.

I (18F), moved out of my mothers apartment to live with my Dad two states away.

My Dad divorced my mother when I was in Elementary School, the reason for their divorce was because my mother had been cheating on my Dad since the year I was born.

I lived with my mother, with pretty regular visits to my Dad's house on the weekends until he got married to my amazing Stepmother and moved a couple states away. I couldn't live with my Dad because of his job, and he had no support system as his family were at least 5+ hours away. He definitely tried his best to change this, especially when my mother began to date a drug addicted felon.

Anyway, Sometime in late July, I received news that my mother had filed for Child Support against my Dad. We didn't exactly need it for the past few years, we'd been sailing pretty smoothly with what we had. I had turned 18 before she filed, and she ""forgot"" to tell me that she was trying to take him to court.

My mother had used the excuse of sending graduation invites to get my Dad's address, or she really was going to send invites and decided to take him to court as well. Either way, she didn't send those invites to anyone in my family.

So, I made plans to move in with him and began to go behind my mothers back with my BFF, (Also 18F), to get storage tubs and travel items for the move. This isn't the only reason I made the decision to move, I'd been thinking about leaving my home state for years because I felt that I was being majorly mistreated and used by my mother and some of her family.​

My mother found out about this, and I told her why I was leaving. She responded by telling everyone on her FB and my maternal side of the family, letting everyone and their mother know what's going on.

I was messaged constantly by them for the rest of the day, telling me I had made a horrible decision and that I needed to come back. They insulted my Dad, they insulted my Stepmother, and by doing so insulted me.

Even my older sibling was messaging me about my ""horrible decision"" even though he was living with my mother and I for a few years after the divorce. He is a whole other story, which I can make another post about if you guys want me to.

I do not regret my choice, I have never been happier despite having moved away from everything I knew. I do however, miss the people I grew up with, I cannot express how much I miss my friends and the family who supported me no matter what. But I am starting new and can't wait to make new friends and new memories.

So AITA?

Please be nice, as my mother and her family are still my family.

104,1fpmj6x,WIBTA if I move out?,"Hi everyone! 

Long time lurking, first time posting.

English is not my first language and I’m not in the US, so I would like to say sorry in advance for any mistakes and I hope that I can be clear enough.

I (28F) am currently sharing an apartment with my best friend (also 28F).

I moved in at the beginning of this year, she used to live with her boyfriend but they broke up. 

At first, everything was ok, we get along really well (still do, that’s not the issue). But recently some things have been bothering me:

- Money. I admit I’m not good with money at all, I’m still paying for college, the rent + utility bills are expensive, I have some credit card debt that I’m paying monthly, and recently I discovered that I have an autoimmune disease (it’s nothing serious, it’s a skin problem to put it simply) that will cost me $300 per month with medicines. Sometimes when things that are not in our control happens, if something breaks for example and we have to split the cost to replace it, I don’t even have money left to eat.

- She has a dog that I absolutely love, but he’s annoying as hell. He opens the doors of our rooms, steals our food, ruins my clothes and my sheets. I had to replace all of my underwear and trousers since I moved because he ruined all of it.

I have the feeling that I can’t relax in my own home. I understand that none of this is her fault, but I’m not happy with the set up anymore and I think that I could save money and live more comfortably if I moved back with my parents (it’s common in my culture to live with family until marriage).

WIBTA the asshole if I move out? I don’t think that she would have enough money to pay for the bills on her own, which is why I’m having second thoughts about going forward with this. 

ETA:

She mentioned before that she wouldn’t want another roommate besides me, so I don’t know what she would do if I move, because she wouldn’t be able to afford the bills alone.",Not enough info,2024-09-26,"WIBTA if I move out? Hi everyone!

He’s been in daycare for two years and has never had an issue besides not being very good at using the toilet.
It’s been a few weeks since daycare and they started numbers, the teacher I assume used this connected blocks to teach them. My son loves number blocks, the toy he took resembles number blocks. When I went to my mother’s who picked him up at the bus stop I noticed he has three yellow blocks in his hand. I asked him where he got it and he said “From a man at the grocery store”. I asked my mother if she knew anything about it and she began to yell at him saying “DONT TAKE THINGS FROM STRANGERS”. I knew that was true cause I’m the only person he goes grocery shopping with. 
I then kneeled eye level down to him and said “You can tell mommy the truth I won’t be mad” and he nervously said he got it from school. I told him it’s okay and I thanked him for being honest. I said we will have to return it to the school. I am not with his dad and haven’t been since my pregnancy but we coparent well. I told him about the incident and he immediately said I should take our son to the school and have him apologize in front of the whole class and teacher….
Now that’s where I may have been a little bit upset, I recall when I was babysitting my cousins and it was my aunts 8 hour shift. I was getting hungry and my aunt had a rule that I was not allowed to eat anything there. So I stole 4 Pringle’s, one of the kids told on me (I was 13) and my aunt told my mom and my mom had me apologized in front of my aunt, her husband and her kids. For years they labelled me “the thief” and would laugh or mock me. So I disagreed with his idea of punishment. That memory still brings back tears to my eyes. 
Now, I did tell my son it is not okay to ever take something that does not belong to you and if you ever wanted something you saw you can just ask and I can see if I can get it for you. After I said that he said he wanted a Peppa Pig toy, he’s been asking for it for weeks. So I said yes, took him to Walmart and bought it.
Now my mother and his dad think I’m being the AH parent by not publicly humiliating my four year old son for taking a toy from school. 
I’m conflicted on whether I’m a bad parent soft or I was breaking generation curses…
To add, my sons father has another son that is known for stealing but his approach on it is literally what he wants to do to our son and I refuse to use his method because clearly it showed no results.
After I bought the toy for my son, he was so happy. I got lots of kisses, hand kisses, shoulder kisses and hugs. Lots of “I love you’s”.

Last Saturday sam and I went to the movies and ofc it was her bday so I paid for it. (Around $30-ish plus her presents so I spent $95 dollars on her in total) after the movie she thanked me and said she was extremely thankful for what I got her.

110,1fpl7lp,AITA for keeping dog ,"AITA for not wanting my grandmother in law close to the dog

my partner (20M) and I (19F) are at a loss. So my partners mother passed unfortunately early last year the dog belonged to her and my partner she lived with them for 10-11 years, after she passed my partner + her moved with his grandmother. That year she also had her son (partners uncle) who is severely addicted to m3th. (He’s a story for another day ) during this time grandma refused to buy dog food because she “didn’t like it” and when she did buy food it would always go moldy. She forgot to give her water constantly she would yell at the dog and throw her toys at her as well when she got upset. She would never walk her and leave the house doors open so she would run off (even after telling her countless times not to). And the cherry on top was the fact that because her son lived there in that year this poor dog ended up getting h!gh 4 separate times (on m3th) AND SHE REFUSED TO TAKE HER TO THE VET!! Or even acknowledge that she was h!gh cuz she was completely blind to her sons us!ng and is the biggest enabler I’ve ever met. We moved out of her house around February since we were trying to stay sober ourselves (my partner is currently just under a year clean and I’ve been since October 16th 2023 which is why we were able to help as much financially for the dog) after leaving her place she tried non stop to cause issues. Her son ended up moving in with us again (we live with my partners grandfather and had no choice in the matter) it took us 8 months to get him out after he once again got the dog h!gh and had the balls to blame ME saying I CAUSED HER LEG CRAMP! So this brings us to now. The dog is finally healthy again, she’s eating good quality dog food, has access to clean drinking water constantly, is walked 2x a day, she’s lost weight and is clearly happy again, rolling around, playing, cuddling the normal happy dog signs. We pay for almost all her things (grandfather helps with vet check ups) and have only had the grandmother out of our lives since July (officially gone completely no contact and it’s heaven) now she texted the grandfather (they are divorced) and is saying she wants to come and take the dog for a walk on Sunday because she misses her and the dog “belongs  to the family”. I think it’s a terrible idea but the grandfather has already agreed and says we should “be kind and the bigger person since she has no one and nothing left” I think she lost her rights to be around this dog!

my partner (20M) and I (19F) are at a loss. So my partners mother passed unfortunately early last year the dog belonged to her and my partner she lived with them for 10-11 years, after she passed my partner + her moved with his grandmother. That year she also had her son (partners uncle) who is severely addicted to m3th. (He’s a story for another day ) during this time grandma refused to buy dog food because she “didn’t like it” and when she did buy food it would always go moldy. She forgot to give her water constantly she would yell at the dog and throw her toys at her as well when she got upset. She would never walk her and leave the house doors open so she would run off (even after telling her countless times not to). And the cherry on top was the fact that because her son lived there in that year this poor dog ended up getting h!gh 4 separate times (on m3th) AND SHE REFUSED TO TAKE HER TO THE VET!! Or even acknowledge that she was h!gh cuz she was completely blind to her sons us!ng and is the biggest enabler I’ve ever met. We moved out of her house around February since we were trying to stay sober ourselves (my partner is currently just under a year clean and I’ve been since October 16th 2023 which is why we were able to help as much financially for the dog) after leaving her place she tried non stop to cause issues. Her son ended up moving in with us again (we live with my partners grandfather and had no choice in the matter) it took us 8 months to get him out after he once again got the dog h!gh and had the balls to blame ME saying I CAUSED HER LEG CRAMP! So this brings us to now. The dog is finally healthy again, she’s eating good quality dog food, has access to clean drinking water constantly, is walked 2x a day, she’s lost weight and is clearly happy again, rolling around, playing, cuddling the normal happy dog signs. We pay for almost all her things (grandfather helps with vet check ups) and have only had the grandmother out of our lives since July (officially gone completely no contact and it’s heaven) now she texted the grandfather (they are divorced) and is saying she wants to come and take the dog for a walk on Sunday because she misses her and the dog “belongs  to the family”. I think it’s a terrible idea but the grandfather has already agreed and says we should “be kind and the bigger person since she has no one and nothing left” I think she lost her rights to be around this dog!

112,1fpl2na,AITA for putting a hidden security camera on my driveway without explicitly telling my roommates?,"TLDR: I suspect that my GF has cheated on me, and I suspect that our roommate (her friend) is breaching our roommate agreement. 

My GF (34F) and I have been dating for 5 years. Last February, I saw a “good morning” text on her phone from a guy I don’t know. When I asked her about this, she said that 1. It was platonic 2. They never dated and 3. He liked her “a really long time ago”. When I asked her if I could see her phone, I learned that this thread had been going on for months (somewhat irregularly), that he had confessed his romantic feelings a couple months ago, and that he had asked her to come over. After her initial response, my trust is broken. 

Going forward, she says she wants to be with me and I want to give her the opportunity to earn back my trust. I’ll never know if her relationship with the guy went beyond text, but I do know that she lied to me about it. Since then, I get lots of affection but that doesn’t help me trust again. She hasn’t yet found a way to show me that she is transparent.

So I put up a camera because I want to be sure no one is coming over while Im away at work 3 nights per week. I also put up a sign.

I discovered something else, however. We have a “part-time” roommate, who asked for a discounted portion of the rent to stay for only x nights of the month with us. If she wants to stay more nights in a month, we agreed that she would pay an additional nightly fee for every night after x. Turns out she’s staying more often than she agreed and isn’t paying for the extra. 

Not only is our roommate being dishonest, but my girlfriend hasn’t told me about it either. It’s possible that she doesn’t pay attention to the number of days the roommate stays, but again my trust has been compromised. That being said, it could be said that Im “spying”. To me, it feels like self defense.

113,1fpl0hm,AITA for asking someone to turn off their music while hiking?,"I was recently hiking in Yosemite when I passed a group of hikers blasting music and I asked them to turn it off. I know they're assholes for playing loud music on a hike, that's not really up for debate here (and no, they definitely weren't playing music to scare off bears). But am I an asshole for saying something?

I was taking in the majestic view that is Half Dome and the Yosemite Valley when I heard a faint, mysterious noise in the distance. They rounded the corner and the unmistakable fiddle from Dexys Midnight Runners' 1982 classic ""Come On Eileen"" began to ring through my ears. A phenomenal song of course (also not up for debate), but not really what anybody wants to hear while on a hike. It kind of ruined the moment, but ultimately I was in awe with what nature had put in front of me so I just gave them the classic hiker nod and moved on. 

I soon reached the viewpoint and spent about 45 minutes resting and taking pictures. For reference, this is a viewpoint overlooking the valley that has a parking lot and trails going in several directions, so people can do short out and backs on different trails. 

A bit after continuing my hike I heard music coming from below me; this time the distinct bass line of a reggaeton song. I then saw the source and realized it was the same people as before, and they must have been doing a couple of hikes from the viewpoint trailheads and gone on this hike while I was taking pictures.

I couldn't really help but say something as we were passing, particularly since this was the second time they were actively impacting my ability to soak in nature's glory. The interaction went something like this: 

**Me**: ""Hey guys, could you please turn off your music?""

**Them**: ""What?"" (presumably because there was music in their ears rather than listening to birds and wind through the trees and a babbling brook and all of the things people go into nature for)

**Me**: ""Please turn off your music, it's poor trail etiquette.""

**Them**: \*proceed to turn the music up and respond in a passive aggressive and sarcasm-soaked tone\* ""Have a nice day man, enjoy the rest of your hike!""

**Me**: \*Impressed with their audacity to crank the music but shocked they don't seem to realize how much everybody else on the trail hates them, I stopped and stared as they rounded the switchback and got closer to me again\* 

""Just so you know, that's extremely rude to other people trying to enjoy their hikes.""

**Them**: ""It's all in your head man, it's all in your head. Enjoy your hike and have a GREAT day!!!!""

About 100 yards down there was a group of hikers resting in the shade who were talking about how much they hated it when people play music on the trail, so I knew I wasn't alone in this fight. But when I got back to camp, someone said that they were likely inexperienced hikers out having fun and I probably should have just kept my mouth shut.

Their son’s new home sits about 30’ off the gravel road and across from my property. The mother asked me if we could slow down while riding on the trail on our property closest to the gravel road to keep the dust down.

116,1fpk6y7,"WIBTA for buying a phone in secret as a 16 year old, when my parents do not allow me to have one","Hi Reddit, I have been wrestling with this for a bit and thought you all could help me with this situation. I just turned 16, and am now going to a school after being homeschooled for 8 years. It is honestly really great for me, I am enjoying the extra challenge and most of all, the new people. For you all to better understand this post, I need to give some extra context. When I was homeschooled, I often snuck on my parent's electronics because I was lonely, and wanted connection. I had no irl friends, so I decided to talk to people online. The problem was that I could not tell my parents that, they were/are really strict. So what I did was pretend I was addicted to video games, which gave me an excuse as to why I was up at 2 am (fun fact, one time when they caught me playing a video game at 2 am they took the locks off my bathroom, and the door off my bedroom. ok off-topic) 

To further enhance the act I had going on, I bought some phones with the money I had saved up from a small part-time job, installed mobile games on them, and kept them hidden as long as possible till my parents found them. When my parents found them, they took them, smashed foresaid phone with a hammer, then for good measure set the whole thing on fire. Their justification was since I disobeyed them, they could do whatever they wanted with the phone. This happened 6 or so times, over the past two years, and made my relationship with them, and I assume their relationship with me really really painful. Well after my money ran out, our relationship got better as I could not buy phones lol, and after a year of persuading they finally let me enroll in a school. The one issue is that some of the clubs and sports I do have information through text/social media, plus I just wish I could talk to my friends after school. As a sophomore, I am legit the only person without a phone in my grade, and aside from it being annoying not to be able to plan any outings and stuff for fun, is also complicating my school life. My question to you all is would it be wrong for me to buy another hidden phone and hide it better, so I could do what I previously said, or should I listen to my parents and not buy the phone?

Oh, here are the 5 reasons my parents gave me if this helps make yall's decision.

1. It is not necessary for a teenager to have a phone, I can buy one when I leave the house

2. I could watch ""immoral content"" online. 

3. They do not trust me based on past experience.

4. We do not make our decisions based on the current culture.

I have my own room, which still has some unpacked boxes, junk, and clothes, since I am not finished moving in. It has been a few months since i moved, but i took essentially 14 years worth of junk over because my mother forcefully packed everything and had me take it all over. So I am still going through my things and deciding what I want to keep and donate. Another story for another day.

I still go to my parents house every other weekend for work purposes, since me and my mom work the same shifts. I stay for Friday and Saturday, and then come back to my grandparents house on Sunday once my morning shift is over. We also get my little sister over on those same weekends.

This weekend is different. My dad has an event out of town, and will be gone all day Saturday. So my little sister will be staying at my grandmother's house Friday night, and will come over Saturday when we're done working. So she will be sleeping in my bed with my cat. My bed is made and finished, mainly because I started sleeping in that room once my cat was brought over. It's also because a few weeks ago, a relative came over and needed my bed, so it had to be made.

The room and bed have been mine for months now, ever since I moved in. And yet, people will sleep in that room without me being notified or asked beforehand.

I've always have issues with privacy. I never got much of it growing up due to school issues and abusive mothers. There was a point in time where I couldnt even close my door without getting in trouble, and my mother even threatened to take it off. This rule stopped only because a cat got locked in there for 2 days without me noticing since he hid under my cluttered bed. Guess who got in trouble for that. People always enter my room without asking. Even if they knock, they dont wait for me to answer before opening the door. I've had to set up multiple boundaries with family members because they dont seem to understand that I want privacy.

Back to the current situation.

My grandmother said my sister is going to, quote, ""stay in her bed with her cat."" I said I was uncomfortable with this, since my sister always tends to leave things messy. I dont want her breaking something or messing something up. My grandmother asked ""why not?"" I explained it to her and she responded with ""shes your sister, she can use your bed. I shouldnt have to ask you since you havent even unpacked all of your things.""

I got mad and argued with her, saying I only brought it up because I wasnt asked and it happened without me being involved despite it being my room. She argued back, calling me selfish and controlling.

My bed is made and finished, mainly because I started sleeping in that room once my cat was brought over. It's also because a few weeks ago, a relative came over and needed my bed, so it had to be made.

The room and bed have been mine for months now, ever since I moved in. And yet, people will sleep in that room without me being notified or asked beforehand.

I've always have issues with privacy. I never got much of it growing up due to school issues and abusive mothers. There was a point in time where I couldnt even close my door without getting in trouble, and my mother even threatened to take it off. This rule stopped only because a cat got locked in there for 2 days without me noticing since he hid under my cluttered bed. Guess who got in trouble for that. People always enter my room without asking. Even if they knock, they dont wait for me to answer before opening the door. I've had to set up multiple boundaries with family members because they dont seem to understand that I want privacy.

Back to the current situation.

My grandmother said my sister is going to, quote, ""stay in her bed with her cat."" I said I was uncomfortable with this, since my sister always tends to leave things messy. I dont want her breaking something or messing something up. My grandmother asked ""why not?"" I explained it to her and she responded with ""shes your sister, she can use your bed. I shouldnt have to ask you since you havent even unpacked all of your things.""

I got mad and argued with her, saying I only brought it up because I wasnt asked and it happened without me being involved despite it being my room. She argued back, calling me selfish and controlling.
