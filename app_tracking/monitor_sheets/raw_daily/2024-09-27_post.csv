0,1fqwms5,AITA for not apologizing to my mom?,"My Mom (42 F) told Me (22 NB) to apologize after I had asked her to be nicer to me about my illness. 

I will not go into specifics on my disease but it’s causing fainting and I can’t drive or work. 

This all started when I had a fainting spell that sent me to the ER about a month ago, yet everything went smoothly and I was sent home with some papers to schedule follow up appointments.

I decided to spend the rest of the day resting considering I had just gone through so many tests and I was still experiencing headaches and pain.

The same morning I got out of the hospital my mom called asking if I had scheduled my appointments yet. I explained my plan to her I’ll start calling the next day because I needed at least some time to recover.

She proceeded to scream at me over the phone about how I needed to do it that very moment.

Given my people pleasing tendencies I folded and made the appointment.

She called me again that day. It shocked me because she didn’t say hello or ask me how I was doing. 

She called to ask me if I was leaving the house or going anywhere. I told her I couldn’t drive and she didn’t say goodbye or that she loved me, she simply just hung up.

I felt disappointed, so I wrote a text expressing how her actions have hurt me, that I understand where it’s coming from, but for the sake of my health I can’t have that kind of unneeded stress. 

She proceeded to tell me that she didn’t want anything to do with me or my life. Leaving me in a tight situation given she was the only family I had that lived under an hour away. 

This last month she has done the following to try and punish me or get my attention.

-Invite me over for dinner last minute so I wouldn’t be able to get a ride or attend

-Calling me to come pick up my clothing she left outside her place, yet when I get there the clothing is not there.

This is what prompted me to make this. Despite saying she absolutely did not want a dog, she adopted a large pit bull.

She sent me a picture of the new dog with the caption 

“You just got a new sibling”

I don’t know if I should be hurt by that or not, but despite our fights I started to ask about the dog saying she was cute, instead of telling me about the dog she responds with “shouldn’t matter to you” passive aggressively. 

I’m very autistic and have a hard time with social situations but I have a feeling she wanted me to respond back just so she could be mean.

I ignored it until I got this response today.

(Warning: cursing)

“You know you just keep shooting yourself in the fucking foot with me. I give you a chance and you fuck it off. Maybe we should just stick to the not talking going forward. I have given you ample time to apologize and not some have assed full of fucking excuses apology and quite frankly (Deadname) I’m done giving you chances.”

(Sorry for the grammar, im not a native English speaker/writer)

I (29f) have been friend with her (34f) for 3 years, we meet at work, and now both are in different places working. We have a average friendship, we meet ones or twice a month for coffee or dinner. She knows my husband and his family, including my BIL for almost 1.5 years. 

BIL (28m) it’s a very good persona little bit shy and reserved, he’s my husband best friend. Very respectful and supportive dude, with the family and specially with my MIL, her mother. 

Like 5 months ago, my husband and I were just chatting and came with the idea this two would maybe be a cool match, she’s also really calm and a shy sometimes. But both of them have similar values, similar interests and good looking. 

So, like two months ago we talked with BIL if he maybe wanted me to make the connection or ask her if she was interested in just getting some coffee or dinner. And he ask me to please don’t ask her because it made him anxious, so after  a few days insisting (my husband was the most enthusiastic of the idea) I gave in and sent him her number so he can make the first move and she didn’t answer. 

Since then I been noticing she stop replying to me on IG (very strange) and I started feeling bad, so yesterday I apologized for putting her in this position that she clearly felt awkward, and that I really missed her. And nothing again. 

Now I feel like a bad friend, for breaking her trust, every minute Im checking my phone to see if she had replied. At lest to tell me that indeed I messed up that bad. 

Ps: they both are attracted to the opposite gender, they’ve met each other a few times, they’ve talked, in different events (birthdays, gatherings, etc.) that we have had in my house, every time very casual and like just been nice to each other, friendly.

So please reddit, AITH for giving my friend’s number to my BIL whiteout asking her firsthand?

2,1fqw1al,WIBTA if I made my disabled aunt pay me back for getting her cats fixed? ,"About 6 months ago I paid to have my aunt's 2 cats sprayed/neutered as well as brought them to and home from the vet appointment. My aunt is older and struggles with several disabilities that prevent her from driving and cause mobility issues and she doesn't have a lot of money. So when I had the extra money I offered to get the two stray cats she's taken in over the last couple of years fixed, I did this on the condition that the cats would be strictly indoor cats from the point forward. 

She was letting the cats outside every day because she's one of those people who think cats should be allowed to run free outdoors, one of the cats came home full of airsoft bullets one time and my mom paid for her vet care, the other was badly injured likely from being hit by a car and had to have surgery which my mom and I paid for as well.
They're also constantly bringing home injured wildlife which I then have to take to the vet if necessary and try to nurse back to health. I used to be a vet tech so I do know how to do this correctly but it's still a major burden on me to constantly have some bird/small animal/lizard I have to care for because my aunt refuses to be responsible. 

Over the past year my mom and I have spent over $4000 dollars on her cats because we felt sorry for them and the wildlife they were hurting and killing. 

My aunt finally agreed that if we got the male neutered she'd keep them in the house and stop letting them be outdoor cats, so we did. We got both cats fixed and all was well for a while until I got a call from her asking if I could pick up a lizard the cats mauled and she admitted she'd let them out again. She completely went back on our deal.

Would I be the asshole if I demanded she pay me back for getting the cats fixed and start paying me back for all the other vet bills? She doesn't have a lot of money but neither do I and I'm so sick of her behavior. 

Update: after speaking to my other aunt this evening about this situation and some of my aunts behavior with past pets, such as receiving tickets for animals at large when she was younger and had a German Shepherd dog she refused to keep home I'm likely going to give her an ultimatum that either she pays me back every dime of the $4k we've spent helping the cats or that she surrenders the cats to me where they will be kept safety indoors and she can still come see them and spend time with them whenever she wants. 
I had no idea she had a history of irresponsible pet ownership and the cats deserve better than this.

4,1fqvq0a,AITA for pretending my best friend died?,"Context: It’s not uncommon for me (18F) or my friend Jane (17F) to make jokes about people dying, but we do this in a very obvious and sarcastic way. Mark (18M) has also made similar jokes about death and has laughed at our jokes. 4 days prior to this incident Mark made a your mom joke to Jane, to which Jane responded very convincingly that her mom was dead and that the joke wasn’t funny (her mom isn’t dead). Mark, not knowing Jane's mother, laughed at this. Keep that in mind when reading the following. 

About 5hrs after having a normaI text conversation with Mark I randomly message him saying “Jane died”, which again isn’t very uncommon of me to say, and I feel that if she had actually died I would have called or sent a longer message, especially considering I’m known to say things like this. He replied saying “what you mean” followed by a deleted message. I responded asking what the deleted message was which ended up just being a spelling error. (I feel that things like me focusing on random details should have been an indicator that this wasn’t serious?) 

The conversation continued with him asking questions and me just placing no significance on the death related questions (which weren’t very many as it was a short conversation) and rather asking about how his day was going. He went along with my random questions and so I assumed he understood it was a joke as he didn’t seem at all stressed in his messages. 

Eventually he sent a message asking if I was ok so I thought he might not be getting the joke and I didn't want him to actually think she was dead so I sent a photo of Jane covered in a blanket in our bedroom, with a witty caption (this should have been an indication that I was joking.) He still seemed concerned so I took another photo of Jane sitting up clearly alive. He then said he was going to block me and that “that's not something to joke about”. 

Normally I would agree as death is very serious and I would understand if he didn’t know my humor or if he didn’t make jokes like this but that's not the case. Also it’s not like I called him crying telling him my friend died, my intention was never to make him believe that she was actually dead but maybe I didn’t make it obvious enough?

After this conversation we found out that he and his friends had told some of our mutual friends about Jane’s “death”. Two of our friends were distraught although two other friends, even without seeing the messages, could sense that this was most probably a joke (one of them even messaged Jane and laughed about the situation). 

All of our friends except Mark are unbothered by all this and understand that I never meant for Mark to actually think Jane was dead. I do feel bad as I never meant for it to go this far and I think the fact that it was over text didn’t help as he couldn't sense my tone of voice. 

Am I the asshole?

6,1fqv8yt,"AITA for resenting my dad for ""stealing"" my inheritance?","A few years ago my (M26) grandfather passed away from this terrible muscle wasting disease called polymyositis.  He and I were very close when I was growing up.  I would come home from school every day and come visit him on his property (he owned a 300-acre cow pasture).  He was an engineer by trade, with a colorful and prestigious career including designing the avionics used on the Apollo lunar landers, teaching for several years at a major university, and working on the RAH-66 Commanche and AH-64 Apache helicopters.

I owe my own interest in STEM to him.  He helped me so much in school and somehow managed to make even the driest math chapter interesting.  We did so much together, from watching Star Trek episodes after school to deep-sea fishing on his boat in the summers.

This relationship with me stood in stark contrast to how he felt about his wife and my dad (he's not my bio grandfather).  They were in a loveless marriage where he felt obligated to provide her with a comfortable place to live even if he resented her.  On the other hand, he absolutely despised my dad, and with good reason - he's a horrible human being who's been married 4 times, been convicted of child abuse (beat my brother until he was badly bruised), and has been divorced at least twice, including my mom, for cheating.

On his death bed, he instructed my mom to go and retrieve a will he had personally drafted, from his office at his home.  This will contained instructions stating that the 300-acre estate was to go to me, along with all of his financial assets, and that my grandmother was permitted to live in the house for the rest of her life and receive social security benefits.

The problem was, as far as I can tell, was that the will was not signed with witnesses, and was therefore not legally binding.  And by the time the will was found tucked away in his office and brought to him at the hospital, he was drifting in and out of consciousness and no longer considered capable of signing it properly. 

So when he passed, everything essentially defaulted to my grandmother, who promptly sold the property (valued at $2.5 million), liquidated all of his remaining assets including his prized gun collection and personal mementos along with $2 million in stocks, and gave all of the proceeds to my dad, who then set up a trust fund.  

Since then, I have not seen a single cent of this, despite drowning in college debt and medical bills.  They never helped me.  So much stress, so much turmoil could have been avoided if I had access to even a fraction of what he intended for me.  Meanwhile my dad is out buying $200K campers and $100K boats.  

Am I wrong to be absolutely disgusted with my dad, to the point where I don't even want to see him at family outings like Thanksgiving and Christmas?  Our last conversation was him criticizing me for wasting my money on mental healthcare instead of saving up to move out of my mom's house - he doesn't believe in mental healthcare.   ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-27,"AITA for resenting my dad for ""stealing"" my inheritance? A few years ago my (M26) grandfather passed away from this terrible muscle wasting disease called polymyositis.  He and I were very close when I was growing up.  I would come home from school every day and come visit him on his property (he owned a 300-acre cow pasture).  He was an engineer by trade, with a colorful and prestigious career including designing the avionics used on the Apollo lunar landers, teaching for several years at a major university, and working on the RAH-66 Commanche and AH-64 Apache helicopters.

I owe my own interest in STEM to him.  He helped me so much in school and somehow managed to make even the driest math chapter interesting.  We did so much together, from watching Star Trek episodes after school to deep-sea fishing on his boat in the summers.

This relationship with me stood in stark contrast to how he felt about his wife and my dad (he's not my bio grandfather).  They were in a loveless marriage where he felt obligated to provide her with a comfortable place to live even if he resented her.  On the other hand, he absolutely despised my dad, and with good reason - he's a horrible human being who's been married 4 times, been convicted of child abuse (beat my brother until he was badly bruised), and has been divorced at least twice, including my mom, for cheating.

On his death bed, he instructed my mom to go and retrieve a will he had personally drafted, from his office at his home.  This will contained instructions stating that the 300-acre estate was to go to me, along with all of his financial assets, and that my grandmother was permitted to live in the house for the rest of her life and receive social security benefits.

The problem was, as far as I can tell, was that the will was not signed with witnesses, and was therefore not legally binding.  And by the time the will was found tucked away in his office and brought to him at the hospital, he was drifting in and out of consciousness and no longer considered capable of signing it properly.

7,1fqv6r7,UPDATE: AITA for snapping at my parents for treating me more like a second mom than their daughter?,"Thanks to everyone who commented and offered support. It really meant a lot. I wanted to give an update on what’s happened since.

Two days ago my dad called and said he was going to visit but then changed his mind and asked if we could meet somewhere instead. When I showed up my mom was with him (not sure why he didn’t mention that) My dad actually tried to listen and understand me but my mom didn’t really let me get my point across. It was so hard to explain how I’ve been feeling recently and how it’s been like this for years. I was only 9 when my first sibling was born (he's 14 now) and I honestly can’t remember if I’ve been able to act like their daughter since then.

Every time I tried to explain how draining this has been. My mom would jump in with ""It was just a brownie"" I mean for God’s sake it’s not about the dessert. Eventually I just excused myself and went home. After that conversation I think I’ve made up my mind to go lo contact with my mom. It’s going to be incredibly hard. More than I can even explain. I’ve always said ""yes"" and put my family first but with my own little family on the way. I don’t want to bring these problems into everything. My fiancé has been really supportive and said he’s with me no matter what I decide.

To answer some of the comments. My fiancé and I don’t live with my parents. We have our own apartment and are working on building our first house. As for how I’m pregnant with my fiancé.

9,1fqv23k,AITA for kicking my friend out of my birthday party?,"I (20F) have celebrated my birthday a few days ago. I’ve had the house to myself and I wanted to celebrate with as many friends as possible.

I have a friend group from my work place and we all became pretty close, that’s how I met with Ellie (20F). I feel like Ellie has some confidence issues that lead her to crave attention. For an example, the same day our mutual friend Emily (21F) got a promotion Ellie had to make a scene and cry (literally cry) about how our boss isn’t appreciating her and got into an argument with Emily after Emily told her it made her uncomfortable she made the day all about herself.

Another good example is when we all were hanging out at a bar and the bartender hit on one of us asking for her instagram and Ellie immediately told her afterwards “he’s a bartender, he’s probably going after who seems the easiest to get with don’t get too excited.”

I’ve been trying to talk to her about her behaviour because even tho she had some issues I didn’t want her to have no one to talk to at work or to be left out. 

Then my birthday arrived, and I wanted to have a big party at my house and I invited all of my friends so I could also introduce them all to my boyfriend (24M).

The party was fun we all got drunk and everyone got along with my boyfriend and at some point Ellie disappeared from the party, we looked everywhere for her until I heard some shoutings from my parent’s bedroom.

When I got there I saw Ellie and her boyfriend under the covers of my parents bed. (The shoutings were from Ellie and her boyfriend after Emily opened the door, apparently it was not even all the way closed) When I got there I was shocked and I acted out of emotion. I told them both to get dressed and get out of my house as quickly as possible. 

I closed the door so no one sees them getting dressed. When they finished Ellie didn’t even look ashamed, just casually walked hand in hand with her boyfriend out the door. 

I feel like I might be the asshole because I can’t imagine how embarrassing it must be to be caught in this position and not only that but to be kicked out infront of everyone and she probably did it because she has some issues with herself, but everyone told me it was the right thing to do.

I had surgery over the summer and took out a big loan, I have 15k to pay back right now but I received a cheque for 5k because I went abroad for surgery (a reimbursement type scheme). Mom offered to pay half of the loan repayment per month to help, I declined, she insists. She hasn’t been able to pay it the past 2 months tho which is fine as I didn’t ask her to help me out. 

My bills cost about 1.4K a month (without food). I pay for our TV + WiFi, Netflix, both mine & my mom’s Spotify, rent (we don’t own our home) and my car + health loan repayment. I’m really stuck for money right now to be honest. I haven’t bought any new clothes this year. My shoes are wearing down and I’m running out of skincare. I don’t drink and don’t socialise much anymore. 

Mom constantly complains about money and feels I should be handing her cash every month. I told her I can if she pays for the bills I pay for so she said no. When the cheque cleared I asked if she needed some money and if 200 might help, she wanted 500. I got annoyed because I don’t plan on keeping any of the reimbursement myself and plan to put it back into the loan to pay it off quicker.

She brought up birthday gifts she bought me too. I got sooo pissed and shouted at her and called her some names. I went to the bank and took out 500 in cash and gave it to her and she’s still mad.

I (23F) and my boyfriend (32M) live in a one bedroom basement apartment in the bottom of a duplex. I’ve been living here for over a year and he moved in early December. We never had any issues with the previous neighbours but since May of this year, the new neighbours moved in. They’re honestly really nice, a young family with a young child. But here’s the thing…I feel like they have no regard for us, living below them, especially early in the morning (I’m talking 6am). We’ve ignored it for months and haven’t said anything until I was woken up at 615 by their child running at full speed right above our room. Maybe I wasn’t the nicest in the moment, but I texted the neighbours “hi can you guys please keep it down. Your son running at full force at 619AM has woken me up. Please be mindful”.

I (23F) and my boyfriend (32M) live in a one bedroom basement apartment in the bottom of a duplex. I’ve been living here for over a year and he moved in early December. We never had any issues with the previous neighbours but since May of this year, the new neighbours moved in. They’re honestly really nice, a young family with a young child. But here’s the thing…I feel like they have no regard for us, living below them, especially early in the morning (I’m talking 6am). We’ve ignored it for months and haven’t said anything until I was woken up at 615 by their child running at full speed right above our room.

15,1fqtdei,AITA For Not Inviting My Friend To My Birthday Celebration?,"Throwaway because I don't really wanna be found

I (18f) have a tradition with my bestie Jane (18f) that every year we go to the fair to celebrate my birthday. Because of where it falls, the fair is usually happening a week or two before my birthday, and it's one of my favorite celebration spots. I take Jane and we go have fun; ride a few rides, eat some fair food, and check out the booths. We usually have a vague game plan of what we're gonna do (this becomes important later). Last year, we decided it would be a fun idea to invite our friend group, consisting of Tony (18m) and Shelia (18f). From the start, it was clear that Shelia was going to cause problems. She made a fuss about everything, including me not paying for her ride ticket fast pass that my parents always pay for Jane and I to have. She didn't like that Jane and I had a plan of what to do and complained all the time while we were there. It was overall not a great experience at the fair for me. This year, to celebrate my 18th, I sat down with Jane and told her flat out that I didn't want to invite ANYONE to the celebration. It was the big year, and I only wanted my bestie part of the full celebration. Keep in mind, I didn't care if someone else came to the fair and we ran into them, I minded that somebody came to the fair exclusively to stick with Jane and I the entire day. Without talking to Jane or I, Shelia thought the plan was going to be the same as last year: we go with the friend group and have fun to celebrate my birthday. She started taking days off work and talking about all the fun stuff we were gonna do at the fair together. Here's where i feel like I might be TA. I basically told Shelia off, not really explaining what she did but in no nicer terms telling her exactly what I wanted to do on my birthday. I told her that is NOT happening, that I'm only inviting Jane and if she wanted to go to the fair, she could! She could totally bring a friend and we eat lunch together, maybe ride a few rides. But she couldn't tag along with me and Jane (which I KNOW she would do). Shelia got really upset and started crying, telling Tony that I was deliberately excluding both of them and saying they couldn't go to the fair when I was there (which was false). Now she's cut contact with me, and another friend took her side. Both now think I'm a jerk, and I do kinda feel that way now because I maybe could've kept the peace and went to the fair with them, instead of arguing with her and making her cry.

   He threatened to tell my mom side of the family that I want to get married and no longer want to go to school. I Begged him for days he didn't, tell anyone at least too my knowledge.  

   Couple months go bye I sat for qualification exams to go into college and I passed the first one the second one out of every thing I got a D in my Physics and an E in my additional mathematics. Which are my core for the course  I want to study.

  The youngest one(8) passed and the two older one (10) and (12) didn't pass. She had promised to deal them if they failed days before.

 She stone walled us because she was angry. I mean all of us including my dad after saying she couldn't be bothered about the school affairs anymore. He had always threatened to change us from our current school since I was 11 but didn't. 

 The second day of stone walling us I was sent on an errand into the room she was staying and out of fear of how she would react when she saw me after Saying we should avoid anything that would make us come in contact, I forgot to greet her. 

 Then she was like is it that I am too small or not enough to be your mother, she said a couple of other hurtful things like comparing me to my cousins who were doing excellently in their med programs, but the one that stuck to me was it was because of your poor performance and that boyfriend of yours, your father is changing their schools.

And I already know when he'll be born because I have a c-section scheduled for medical reasons so this is set in stone. We chose to name him after my husband's dad who died when he was a baby. This was something very important to him and therefore was important to me. This was decided early in my pregnancy but didn't get announced until my baby shower some weeks ago. We only let people know then because some wanted to personalize their gifts to us or add additional gifts with the name.

My oldest sister (36F) is due late December/early January. This is also her first child after 12 years of infertility and struggling to conceive. Our middle sister (34F) was the first to have kids and has five now. She's also done having kids. For my oldest sister, watching our middle sister have kids so easily really hurt her and I know their relationship struggled because my middle sister ""joked"" that she would carry a baby for my oldest sister and her husband and she didn't say it as a joke at first. It was really hurtful to her. So there's some family tension there. I was disgusted by what our middle sister did too. They were always closest since they were only 2 years apart. I was never very close to either because of the bigger age gap.

My oldest sister and I grew closer with our pregnancies and she had told me she had a boy name picked out but not a girl one yet because they had changed their mind about the girl name they'd chosen. She asked if she could tell me when they decided on a girl name. I said of course. They found out they were having a boy a few days before my shower but she decided to wait to tell me the name until after because she didn't want to take the focus off me. But then my son's name was announced... and it was the same name as the one they had chosen.

She asked me afterward if we could find another name. She said she really wants her son to have his own special name and they've had this name chosen for 10 years. I told her this is my late FILs name and means so much to my husband. She told me she really doesn't want the cousins sharing a name. I said it could be worse. She left in tears and she went quiet for a while. But after a couple of weeks she asked me again to please consider another name. I let my husband know what was going on and we worked out something to say together... and then I communicated that we would not change the name. When she pushed I pointed out my son would be born first so it wasn't me stealing the name. She made it very clear how hurt she is and how she feels like both me and our middle sister fail to understand all she's been through and lack compassion for her.

22,1fqs93y,"AITA for demanding that my niece, or her parents, pay me back for the hundreds of dollars of perfume she stole from me?","(**Note: I’m not involving the police, suing anyone, etc. Please don't try to argue with me about this or ""convince"" me why I should.**)

I have a perfume collection that I started when I was a teenager slinging burritos as my first job. I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I’m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc. 

What I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn’t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her “private” Instagram wasn’t “friends only” or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had.

I tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the “Tiktok famous” perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn’t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc. 

Petty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she’d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers.

She is lucky that I have no interest in involving the police, small claims, or any of that. But AITA, because she IS a teenager?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-27,"AITA for demanding that my niece, or her parents, pay me back for the hundreds of dollars of perfume she stole from me? (**Note: I’m not involving the police, suing anyone, etc. Please don't try to argue with me about this or ""convince"" me why I should.**)

I have a perfume collection that I started when I was a teenager slinging burritos as my first job. I have over 400 bottles at this point, I take great pride in my collection, and I use it. I’m also happy to give people decants (samples) of most of my bottles, let them sample a spray or two, give some bottles as gifts, etc. 

What I have a HUGE fucking issue with is my 17 year old niece coming into my home under the guise of walking my dog, decanting bottles on her own and SELLING THE SAMPLES to her little friends. She thinks that because I have so many bottles, I wouldn’t notice some missing or getting massive dents in them. Well little miss entrepreneur failed to realize that her “private” Instagram wasn’t “friends only” or whatever and I saw each and every fucking story with each price and sample she had.

I tallied that shit up and got a pretty good estimate based on cost per ounce. Thankfully she mostly picked the “Tiktok famous” perfumes like Bianco Latte and Escapade Gourmand and didn’t go for the most rare, niche perfumes. She did snatch an entire 2.5 oz bottle of Baccarat Rouge, though, which runs $300+ at most retailers, as well as full bottles of perfumes you can get at Sephora. Like Marc Jacobs Daisy, Burberry Her Elixir, Flowerbomb, etc. 

Petty or not, I printed out the entire list of what she’d taken, price estimate, and handed it off to my sister (her mom). I said that I expect to be paid back, in full. And of course her fucking sneaky little ass is never allowed in my home again. My sister got super pissy with me going on about how my niece is just a kid, kids make mistakes, etc. I said yes, kids make mistakes, and this is a GREAT way for my niece to learn from hers.

So, I live in Scandina and most people keep to themselves but are kind if you talk to them on the bus and stuff like that.

I recently moved back to my hometown,  and close to where I learned to play drums. It was a fantastic experience for me to learn music and have an outlet for my energy. Which brings me to today. I saw my drum teacher again, let's call him Jim. We are waiting on the bus, I said: please excuse me, do you mind if I ask where you work? I realized how insane that sounds and started explaining that he doesn't have to tell me of course, but it's just that I was his student. Of course Jim did not hear the last part but just started to scream at me to get away and that he didn't know me. Jim walks away, I walk away. Jim walks by me again and starts to run(?) And I just ignore him, I don't even look up. Unfortunately, we take the same bus. I just let Jim board first and sit far away from him. And that was it.

Please keep in mind that I have a cane so I'm very slow even when walking normally. I also have a photographic memory. It felt weird for him to be screaming at me especially because I focus on being polite. And yes I know the introduction line was terrible and I should have said something else.

34,1fqorjr,AITA for refusing to pay a neighborhoood kid for cutting my lawn when I didn't ask him to?,"I (29M) recently bought my first house. I'm settling in and like the neighborhood, and a few neighbors even came by to say hello. They included a woman (43F) and her 13 year old son.

Not long after, I was on my couch one afternoon and saw the son outside, mowing my front lawn. I was confused, since I'd never asked him to and he'd never offered. I went out and politely asked him why he was doing it - he said he did it for lots of neighbors, and quickly added they give him $5 for it. I found it really weird,  so thanked him for the partial work he'd done, before explaining that since I hadn't asked or wanted him to do it, I wasn't going to be paying him. He said OK, and quietly left my lawn. 

I figured that might be the end of it - just a kid trying to make some money, resolved with no harm done, end of story. But the next day his mom arrived on my doorstep and angrily asked me why I hadn't paid her son. I basically repeated what I'd said to her son, but she wouldn't accept it. She just kept saying that it was a kind gesture, and that he does it for all the other neighbors. She also said $5 isn't a lot of money and I could have just gave it to him. I kept trying to explain that an agreement like that needs to be set up ahead of time otherwise it's nothing more than a random demand for money, but she basically tuned me out and ended up walking away as I was talking. I was amazed the adult in the situation was handling it worse than the literal child was. I'm wondering how much longer this will go on for.

That was last week. Every time I've seen her since, she's stared daggers at me or made a show of crossing the street to avoid me. I'm not instigating anything further - I really have no desire to speak to her - but I'm thinking she might try to send her poor kid back to collect the money, or even mow the lawn again.

I've vented about this to family and friends, and while most seemed to agree with me, some said I should have been grateful and paid the boy, and just told them from then on not to mow the lawn. I can't tell if I've been an ass here, or if my reaction to the whole thing was entirely justified.",Not the A-hole,2024-09-27,"AITA for refusing to pay a neighborhoood kid for cutting my lawn when I didn't ask him to?

35,1fqokp0,AITA for telling my sister I wouldn’t look for earring I “lost”,"For a little backround, me (17F) and my sister (21F) have small arguments, one point that she preaches as we steal eachother things regularly, is to return something where you found it after borrowing or stealing it. Keeping that in mind, she has lost my hockey stick( I have a different one but I sometimes would use that one) for over 6 months with me always asking her to look for it and find it. When my other sister (16F) found it in a hockey bag in our storage room instead of apologising for not looking for it properly, my sister said “oh well I looked there so” and walked away. This made me mad because she always said she looked everywhere in the house and didn’t have any time to look for the hockey stick.  
                                                        A week after finding my hockey stick I lend her my keys that have a keychain I got in a country we went to so I can’t replace it. She also lost these and said she would look for them but took her a month to find them in one of her hoodie pockets. During the time in which she lost them if she asked me “is that my hoodie” or asking if i took her clothes I would say “find my keys and then I’ll return/look for it”. Remember this and the keys later on in the story.

I did just the thing with the following day I replaced her earrings back exactly where I found them, on her messy wardrobe drawer top. A week later (my keys were still missing), my sister (F21) asked me through my closed door while I was watching something “where is my other earring”. Not even knowing which earrings she was talking about and wanting to motivate her to find my keys I said “I’ll look for them once you find my keys”. That was forgotten about until yesterday, a day after she had found my keys (finally). She stormed into my room and asked me to find her earring as I only returned one. Now knowing which earring she was talking about I told her that I had already returned them and that she lost them.

Lately, though, I’ve been really worried about her boyfriend, Jake (30M). Honestly, he’s so toxic. He always makes these snarky comments that put her down, and it’s just not cool. Sarah always laughs it off and says he’s just joking, but I can tell it’s messing with her head.

Last weekend, I decided to throw a little get-together at my place, thinking it would be a fun night for everyone. But as soon as Jake showed up, he was back at it, making fun of Sarah’s outfit and rolling his eyes whenever she spoke. I could literally see her getting smaller and smaller in her seat, and I just couldn’t hold it in anymore.

I ended up saying something in the heat of the moment. I called him out right there in front of everyone, saying he was treating her like garbage and she deserves way better. I thought I was being a good friend, trying to make her see how messed up he is. But then I totally crossed a line and brought up some personal stuff Sarah had shared with me, thinking it would wake her up.

As soon as I said it, everything went silent. Sarah looked stunned, and I could see tears welling up in her eyes. Jake went off, calling me a backstabber and saying I was ruining their relationship. Everyone was just staring, and I felt like I was in some crazy drama.

Sarah ended up storming out, and I tried to follow her, but she wouldn’t even look at me. Now I’ve been trying to reach out, but she’s ghosting me. I feel awful because I never meant to hurt her, but I thought I was standing up for her.

38,1fqocd3,AITA for not noticing I was making people uncomfortable?,"I (16F) and my four friends (16F) have known each other for about five years, since middle school. I've always been the quiet one, which led to people talking over me. In 2020, I decided to match their energy and told them to be blunt with me about any issues in our friendship. I’m not great at picking up social cues, so I made it clear that I needed open communication. They all agreed to this separately.

This summer, there was a serious incident involving one of them and the police on a school trip. I had to call my mom and teacher to help them get released. Afterward, I heard nothing from any of them all summer, even though I’d gone to Europe with one of their brothers for a week. 

Two weeks into this school year, out of the blue, all four texted me separately, saying they didn’t want to be friends anymore. Their reasons included: “you make us uncomfortable with your jokes,” “you talk over people,” and “you’re very rude.” These would be valid reasons, except for two things:

1. I’ve been matching their energy for years. They often made the same types of jokes, so I joined in. They talked over each other, so I did too. That’s how our group dynamic worked.
2. I specifically told them to communicate openly if I ever crossed a line. 

They said they’d been ""talking for a while"" about how to tell me. How long is “a while?” The whole summer? The last two years? I’ll probably never know, and maybe it’s better that way.

One of them lives just a street away, and we used to hang out often, talking about things like comics and D&D. They could’ve easily come over and spoken to me in person. I tried texting them all over the summer, but none of them responded. 

Lastly, the one who lives near me and another friend used to talk behind people's backs. I saw it happen once after a party, and even though I found it weird, I didn’t say anything. I thought maybe that was just how high school friendships worked. Now, I’m not so sure. I trusted them to be honest with me, but now it feels like they were probably talking about me behind my back for a while.

41,1fqmbam,AITA for not babysitting for my parents so they can have time together for the first time in over a year?,"My parents have me (16m) and my siblings Kacen (12) and Melody (10). Kacen and Melody are on the autism spectrum and Melody has medical problems and gets food through a tube in her stomach instead of eating (she's had it since she was really young). So my siblings take up a lot of my parents time and resources. They dedicate a lot of time to caring for my siblings and providing for us. I never minded not having a lot because I know money needs to go on medical expenses and all kinds of things like that. But I always hated whenever I'd miss out on experiences because of my siblings. Even if it was just going to the park or my parents finding something fun that I could do with friends that they could afford. It made me feel a little like I had to give up everything fun for my siblings.

My parents told me months ago that they really wanted to reward me for being so good about everything. And they have always been good at praising me for behaving well and for understanding. My best friends parents own a cabin and had offered to let me go with them and some of our other friends for a week. All they asked was $100 to go toward food because it would help them afford to bring us all. My parents said of course. Since we never go on vacations because of my siblings they knew how much it meant to me. They worked it out with my best friends parents but at the last minute they said they didn't have the money and told my best friends parents it could be next year before they could give it to them. So I couldn't go. They told me after they told my best friends parents. They apologized but said Kacen needed some sensory toy or whatever and that it was more of a need than the vacation. This was the latest in a string of them letting me down. Dad and mom both I should say. Not just one of them. But both of them. Since Covid they have been especially bad at it.

I've been angry at them ever since. I know they saw it as a need for my brother but it always sucks coming in last to my siblings. My parents have tried apologizing but I told them they won't make it up to me so they can save their apologies. And lately they've been feeling really burnt out and wanted a date night. I babysat before so they could have those but not in over a year. I told them I won't babysit for them since they can prioritize that for themselves but they couldn't find a way to make the first thing in four years work for me. They asked me to please reconsider and we went over it a lot. They really wanted a few hours off but I told them they'd need to pay a sitter. They said it was disappointing that I was showing no understanding for this.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-27,"AITA for not babysitting for my parents so they can have time together for the first time in over a year? My parents have me (16m) and my siblings Kacen (12) and Melody (10). Kacen and Melody are on the autism spectrum and Melody has medical problems and gets food through a tube in her stomach instead of eating (she's had it since she was really young). So my siblings take up a lot of my parents time and resources. They dedicate a lot of time to caring for my siblings and providing for us. I never minded not having a lot because I know money needs to go on medical expenses and all kinds of things like that. But I always hated whenever I'd miss out on experiences because of my siblings. Even if it was just going to the park or my parents finding something fun that I could do with friends that they could afford. It made me feel a little like I had to give up everything fun for my siblings.

My parents told me months ago that they really wanted to reward me for being so good about everything. And they have always been good at praising me for behaving well and for understanding. My best friends parents own a cabin and had offered to let me go with them and some of our other friends for a week. All they asked was $100 to go toward food because it would help them afford to bring us all. My parents said of course. Since we never go on vacations because of my siblings they knew how much it meant to me. They worked it out with my best friends parents but at the last minute they said they didn't have the money and told my best friends parents it could be next year before they could give it to them.

42,1fql36a,AITA for not selling an expensive laptop I was given so my parents can afford for my sister to go to an autism program?,"My 12 year old sister has autism. The older she gets the more trouble she has interacting with people and calming herself. When she was younger she could self sooth and other things so much better than now. Her behavior is way worse than before too. She cries a lot more, screams a lot more and she breaks stuff more often. Not to mention she spits out food way more often than before too because food can be sensory overload for her. My parents have spent a lot of time and money trying to get her all the help she needs and trying to make life more comfortable and accessible for her. This comes at my expense a lot. I don't get to go out with friends very much unless a friend can pay for me, my stuff is all second hand including my school laptop (which I needed for high school) that can do so little because it's so old and slow and takes forever to use. I don't get new clothes. I don't get nice gifts from my parents for birthdays and Christmas. They try to still spend some time with me or their treat for me is occasionally letting me get a dessert somewhere because we don't buy those anymore since they see it as money that can be saved and put to helping my sister.

A few months ago my parents learned about this program for autistic tweens and teens. It's expensive to join and they don't offer any financial aid with it. But a lot of people swear it's a great resource for kids who could use help socializing, making new friends and even learning how to handle emotional control again. They have therapists, psychologists and adults with autism who have experience with this stuff to help kids. On top of activities and stuff. They started saving but it's such an expensive program. It happens after school and weekends and you can choose when your kid joins.

Three weeks ago I was given a gaming laptop by someone close to me. This laptop costs more than 1k and was the nicest thing anyone ever gave me and really blew me away. I asked someone to keep it safe for me, because I was worried my sister would break it. When my parents learned about it through another person they suggested it would be better sold and the money used for the program for my sister. I said no. They asked me why I need something so expensive when it could be put to way better use. I told them I want the laptop and I can look forward to using it in a couple of years. They said it's selfish to think of wants over needs. I told them it was a gift for me and not my sister. They said I already have a laptop and I brought up how it's basically a sloth. They said it still cost them $70 which is a lot for them. Then they told me I already have a job so I could save and buy a laptop in a few years. But to think of how much that money would benefit my sister. I kept saying no and my parent think I'm TA.

43,1fqkwa6,AITA for expecting more from sibling when my parents are satisfied as is?,"My brother Joe (25) lives with my parents. I (36) do not live at home. I live far and don't visit too often. I talk to my parents daily and I talk to Joe maybe once every two weeks. Usually I contact him first and sometimes he contacts me to ask for help or advice, which I appreciate. I believe he has some mental health issues. He's not social. Covid played a big role as it happened right when he was entering college, so he didn't get to go to college in person. He is studying online. I try my best to help him, encourage him and suggest different ways he can improve his social life, he listens and agrees, but doesn't act on it. I can't force him to act on it and I can't keep going on about the same. I put a lot of time into connecting him with people, organisations, and clubs, but he doesn't act on it.

My parents are loving, but they think it's just his personality and nothing is wrong. I talked to them about it a few times and it went nowhere. There were a couple of times when I pushed it and it got a little heated and emotional, so I haven't raised it again since. They support him in whatever he wants to do, but he doesn't want to do much, and so they support him on that.

The problem I have is that he doesn't participate in the family. It's like he doesn't understand his role in the family. A particular example that annoys me: he never gets celebration gifts or even cards for anyone. When I became an adult, I started gifting to my parents and I gift to Joe, my parents gift to him and to each other. So he can see what happens around celebrations and yet he never thinks that he should also try to do the same.

A more recent incident. I am staying at the family house next month as I will be working in their city. I am bringing my dog. I mentioned to Joe that he could take the dog for a walk so I don't have to visit on my lunch break to do it. I even offered money for it. He was totally against the idea, he didn't really say anything, just made a really dissatisfied face (context: sometimes he acts like a teenager. Sarcasm, making faces, rolls his eyes, the kind of behaviour I expect from a 16 yo). I didn't push the request with him, as I appreciate it is not his responsibility and it isn't necessary. But it's the principle of the situation that annoys me. I feel like we are all there for him, but he is not there for us (I say us, but I am the only one who feels this). It's as if he doesn't 'get' how families or friendships work, but I feel there is no reason for him not to understand as he is a witness to these dynamics every day. 

I tried to talk about this to my parents, but they think it's just about the dog, which it's not. The obvious thing is to talk to Joe, but I also feel like he will think it's about the dog and may feel pressured to walk the dog. I could bring in other examples to convey the overall situation, but I also don't want him to suddenly feel like he has been doing everything wrong all this time.

I (25M) Yesterday I was in my socials when I stumble upon the ending scene for Joker 2. Now me and my friends have talked about how dry superheroes movies feel this year with the only big ones we are/where interested in being Deadpool and wolverine and me personally Venom 3. My friend group has shown absolutely no interest in seeing Joker 2, so as I stumbled upon the ending scene being hilariously bad. I decided to share a spoiler for it in our chat. Now the spoiler was a screenshot with little words that you HAVE to open the screenshot to see the spoiler. But never the less one of my friends, lets call him steve (26M) got mad at me for this. Granted Steve has said before he doesn’t really care about spoilers. He’s the type of person who would look up plot summaries in wikipedia BEFORE watching the movie. 

Now after I posted about the spoiler, I was talking about this drug I found online that seems to be effective for people with alopecia. I have severe alopecia and am suffering from it emotionally. Everyone close to me knows this is a very sensitive topic for me. While I was asking my other friend if he knew about the drug, steve out of nowhere said “Well since you spoiled joker for me I hope you go fully bald for your wedding”.

Im getting married in November and have been dealing with the fact that in my photos of my very special and long awaited day, I will appear with paches of missing hair, which is one of the things I did not wanted. 

We’re a close bunch, but I just felt this message very hateful and just unnecesarry for no reason.

45,1fqksne,AITAH For doing nothing during my parents divorce?,"Hello, i am 20M my parents got divorced 2 years ago. Because my dad tried to cheat on my mom with my mom’s mom (grandma). It didn’t happen but my mom was so upset (rightfully). They got in fights a lot my mom sometimes hit my dad and was encouraging me to hit my dad too. I never did it. And she was so mad because I didn’t hit my dad and said i never defended her in her life. and after 3 months of constant fighting thy decided to chill down and try to work through it. But my mom start to talking to other guys. Like she talked and I suspect some times went on a date with them. And after my dad found out they got divorced. Now where was I during all these mess? I was trying to study for my first year in university. First i was so mad at my dad but after a while he said sorry and I accepted his apology. ( i love my parents so much). And sometimes after when my mom was talking to other guys she tried to ask what i thought about those guys. I tried to play it cool for sometime but i got irritated and told her please stop asking for my opinion on those guys (she got mad at me).

And after they got divorced I stayed where i was (at my father’s house). And i had some reasons:
1. I knew my mom would continue to date guys (I didn’t like it but I never said anything)
2. I didn’t want to be a burden for her while she was moving out to a new home

After she left, she start to date a guy and she was happy so i wasn’t too mad about it.
But after a while the guy MOVED IN with my mom. So I wasn’t comfortable going to my moms home. And mostly she came to visit me. But she was still mad at my dad so one day when i was at university she came to my father’s house and tried to steal his money. He found out and got mad at her at said she can’t come to his house any more. So i tried to visit my mom once or twice a week but it was my first year of university and it was hard. But after a while my dad said she can come and visit and its ok.

For the record here is what happened. They got divorced. My mom found a boyfriend and the boyfriend moved in. I don’t like boyfriend so i dont go there.

After the boyfriend broke up with my mom, she got so depressed and she called me multiple times that she is so depressed and needs help. And for sure i went there and helped her. Since the boyfriend left i stay at my moms house weekly. Like out of a month i stay at my moms home for 2 weeks.

But here is the problem:
She always telling me that I chose my father and i don’t like her. 
I chose my father for money. 
That im a bad person because I didn’t tell her to break up with her boyfriend.
And once she kicked me out of her home and broke my phone, and she made me wait in street for my dad to pick me up and meanwhile she was telling me super bad things.

When she gets mad she call me names, makes fun of how i talk, she says i talk like a gay man

48,1fqk5ff,AITAH for liking my coworkers Instagram story,"Okay, so I(25M) just got into a fight with my girlfriend(23F) about her trust issues and my role in causing them from our past arguments. To preface, I had previously hidden messages from 3 female coworkers. I did this a couple months ago due to some bad reactions she had to my previous conversations in group chats that involved those 3 female coworkers, and I didn’t want her to get upset if she found anything wrong with the way I interacted with my female coworkers. So eventually we had a fight and that concluded with me agreeing to not hide messages. She constantly brings this up and mentions how she feels insecure because I’ve hidden messages and that she doesn’t trust me because of that. 

 Recently, we had a fight about the trust issues again, and today I noticed that she was sad and down so I decided to talk to her about it. We were in an argument for a while, but wanted to make up in the end, but just before we could settle down, she brings up that she saw that I liked my coworkers instagram story. Now, we have previously discussed what her boundaries are to liking stories of people and that she didn’t like that. I apologized for that, and I told her that I was willing to block the coworker if that would make her more comfortable. I was also very upset, however, that she didn’t tell me that she went through my phone and blocked my coworker and several other people behind my back without telling me. I told her that I felt like there is no trust and that she doesn’t trust me at all, but she also says that I am not trust worthy and don’t deserve her trust. 

Now I want to know, AITAH for liking the story and am I unworthy of trust from her, or do I deserve the trust and that it’s not okay for her to go through my phone behind my back. I did apologize to her for liking it and that she was valid for her feelings, but I also feel like she hasn’t given me much trust throughout the relationship.

To preface, I had previously hidden messages from 3 female coworkers. I did this a couple months ago due to some bad reactions she had to my previous conversations in group chats that involved those 3 female coworkers, and I didn’t want her to get upset if she found anything wrong with the way I interacted with my female coworkers. So eventually we had a fight and that concluded with me agreeing to not hide messages. She constantly brings this up and mentions how she feels insecure because I’ve hidden messages and that she doesn’t trust me because of that.

49,1fqk46j,AITA for not letting my friend borrow money,"
Back story my best friend and I have known each other since high school. I’ve let her borrow money and she’s always paid me back. I’ve borrowed money from her too and I’ve paid it back as well. Today she calls me while me and my husband are getting tattoos and mind you my husband put in like 30 hours of overtime at work. He legitimately works more than his bosses. They even tell him he puts in more hours than them. My daughter is disabled and I had to because of the state have some type of special certified babysitter. Due to this my husband has allowed me to to work part time and normally works just 10 hours of overtime. Solely to make sure we have two full time incomes. When my best friend called for money she said “can I borrow $75 because this person is talking 💩 about me. Work just informed me they making me wait till next week to fix my check they messed up on” I asked why this person was talking poorly of her and why did she owe them money. I was informed she got a smoke front from said person. I specifically said “let me make sure all my bills are taken care of and let me talk to my husband.” We budgeted for our tattoos and we made sure the car note, phone bill, and insurance was accounted for before getting tattoos. My friend also recently asked if I’d purchase her daughter a cake for her birthday because her job shorted her two days of pay which did put her in a bind. I agreed to do the cake for her daughter. I even apple paid my friend $10 for food because she said “I’m at work one of my coworkers gave me some crackers because I was going to pass out from hunger” I never asked her to pay me back ether because I understand how uncomfortable it is to be hungry at work. Literally right after I get off the phone with my best friend she send me a snarky text saying “sorry I even asked” I was busy so I didn’t reply then about an hour of so later she texts again telling on Saturday which is pussoed to be the day of her daughter birthday party to get my crap from her house. So she’s mad? Mad? Just because I said let me handle my business first. She seems to think because I’m married and I can work part time and have family support with my child that life is buttery smooth for me. Don’t get me wrong we love comfortably but I still also louvre pay check to pay check too! Just like her. So I told my husband about all this.

This appointment was on Wednesday and I took the day off work to go with her. On the morning before I went to see my mum I was sat with my girlfriend who was working from home.

She started talking about going on holiday at the beginning of next year. I asked if we could not talk about it yet since I didn't know if I'd be wanting to go away early next year as I don't know the outcome of the hospital appointment.

I also pointed out I can't really think about anything else atm. She didn't listen and kept on trying to show me holidays and asking me to choose dates. I told her again that I don't want to look at holidays yet and we can look another time.

She continued trying to show me trips and I just got angry at this point and told her to start listening to me and stop showing me holidays when I'm getting sorted to find out how seriously ill my mum is. I asked if her mum had cancer if she'd be so obsessed with going away.

I told her that she can see I'm worried and don't ant to talk about holidays so why does she think her desire to go away is more important than what I'm going through.

She said I was being cruel and shouldn't be getting angry at her but I just pointed out she should have listened to me the first two times I asked her to stop then.

I applied for a role about a month ago and my mum suggested to me that I didn’t immediately mention it to her. I let myself grow there for a bit and slipped it in into conversation and see what happened. 

Well as soon as I mentioned it, my friend immediately applied for a role working at the same company. (It’s volunteer). 

I decided after this that I didn’t want to mention things anymore. It might sound selfish and stupid but I feel like I don’t have anything to myself. It might sound like I’m trying to get ahead but I promise it’s not that.

53,1fqj9nu,AITA for not helping my mom raise my sister's child when she could be taken into foster care?,"My sister died last year. We were estranged and I had nothing to do with her in the final years of her life because her child who is now 4 years old and might even be 5 now, was the result of an affair between my sister and my now ex-husband, but he was my husband at the time. I told my sister once she did that to me she was dead to me and I would never forgive her or want to see her again. I never forgave her and still don't. I have zero regrets now that she's gone either.

I never met her child. I have no interest in being a part of their life even now. Which means I don't see my mom as much now because she has custody of my sister's child. My ex isn't in the picture and he is supposed to be paying child support but evades it currently.

My mom is struggling. She's not in the best shape after years of physical issues. Money is getting tighter between one thing and another. She has asked me for help several times. Her fear is the child will be taken into foster care if she can no longer cope doing it alone. But I refuse to offer any help.

I told my mom I love her. But I can't be selfless enough to want to help the child. I told her I can't even imagine stepping up given what their birth symbolizes to me. I told her I know that's hard for her to hear but a part of me will always hate her parents. There will always be a level of disgust I feel toward both my sister (even now she's dead) and my ex for fucking around on me and making a kid together. I have a problem that leads to infertility to it was an especially big betrayal for me. And I could never be fair or look beyond that to love the child in question. It wouldn't be fair to them.

And yes, I had therapy and I'm still in therapy. I have done a lot of work on myself where I could move forward. But some things will never be moving forward with me. Like the idea of forgiving them or wanting their child in my life.

My mom can't understand. She can't really understand me not forgiving my sister now that she's dead at the very least. But she can't understand me not wanting anything to do with her child. My mom said she would have loved nieces and nephews. She's also angry that I would rather see her grandchild go than help. She can't understand how I could live with myself or how I could tell her I'd sleep better with that than having them in my life.

My older sister (28) recently got engaged to her partner of a few years (idk his age but close to hers). He and I (26f) have always been on good terms but we don't really talk to each other on our own. Recently, though, he's been sending me selfies on snapchat. There is nothing glaringly wrong with them, but in every one he's doing what I can only describe as a ""smolder"" face. There's never a message to accompany them, and it's not like he has his shirt off, but something about it just feels really weird to me. Am I overreacting to think it's inappropriate to send your soon to be sister in law selfies like this? He's done it at least four times and I have yet to acknowledge anything he's sent me beyond opening them. I am intending to tell my sister, but for some reason I am nervous that I will be blowing things out of proportion or cause a needless problem.

UPDATE: I feel silly now. I took the advice to bring it up jokingly and also jokingly acknowledge it to him in reference to it being weird. She told me he sends it to everyone for streaks. In my defense I had no idea people did that until some of yall brought it up. But yes - all is well. She doesn't seem concerned whatsoever. Personally, I still find it weird, but I did my part. I'm just going to ignore his snaps and not open them from now on. Thank you to everyone for your advice! Yall really helped me get out of my own head.

My older sister (28) recently got engaged to her partner of a few years (idk his age but close to hers). He and I (26f) have always been on good terms but we don't really talk to each other on our own. Recently, though, he's been sending me selfies on snapchat. There is nothing glaringly wrong with them, but in every one he's doing what I can only describe as a ""smolder"" face. There's never a message to accompany them, and it's not like he has his shirt off, but something about it just feels really weird to me. Am I overreacting to think it's inappropriate to send your soon to be sister in law selfies like this? He's done it at least four times and I have yet to acknowledge anything he's sent me beyond opening them. I am intending to tell my sister, but for some reason I am nervous that I will be blowing things out of proportion or cause a needless problem. I've even had a nightmare that he made a move and when I demanded he tell my sister or I will, they ended up calling off the engagement.

Me and my friends are all 16-17-year-old girls attending a private high school that offers various scholarships. I am on an academic scholarship, and a few of my closest friends are amazing singers on singing scholarships. Namely Kate, who has always been on a singing scholarship and often gets the lead roles in out school musicals. I am not exaggerating when I say she could easily go professional. Sarah (not her real name) is not on any scholarships, though she is incredibly wealthy. Despite Sarah being in many choirs, her singing level would probably get a few cheers in a public karaoke bar but not much more than that.

Recently, my school held auditions for a small, selected choir that would tour internationally and represent out school. I didn't audition, but my friends all did. Unsurprisingly, Kate and the other scholarship singers made it in, while Sarah did not.

During a musical rehearsal, Sarah was obviously pissed, constantly making passive-aggressive remarks about how the ""poor kids"" got in because the school wanted to look good and accusing the teachers of favoritism, especially towards Kate. She had been making these comments since Friday afternoon, and I didn't say anything since I thought it would die down, but it just seemed to get worse as no one agreed with her. This afternoon, Sarah approached me and continued insulting Kate and the other students who got in. I was pretty pissed and said ""You are not a good enough singer to be saying this shit. When was the last time you got casted for ANY role? You didn't even make callbacks for this musical, and you think you can get into a select choir. You're delusional"". Sarah left in tears, calling me a ""bitch.""

Afterward, Sarah sent me a text accusing me of embarrassing her publicly, and Kate messaged in out group chat that while she appreciated that someone stopped Sarah's behaviour, it wasn’t the my place to insult her in return as it'll cause future problems.

60,1fqhg24,AITA for making my gf between me or the cat?,"Me (20m) and my gf (21f) are moved in together. 

For some context. 

We have been dating for about a year. We moved in together really early (around 7 months in) I wanted to move her out of her abusive household and have her essentially start fresh. I bought her a car and drove her around when she didn’t have a car. (It’s about an hour drive from my house to hers) 

When we moved in together we talked about all aspects of everything 

Chores 
How we gonna pay for things 
All that 

When we we started living together she didn’t originally pay for a lot of stuff. Then we agreed that I would take her whole check and then I would give her the rest of what’s left over (she was ok with this since she said she isn’t good with managing money) cool.

Then some pushy things happened 

We both agreed to have cats but I wanted them at a later date so I can establish myself with having bills and such. But about a week in she pressured me to get 2 cats. I caved in fine as long as she’s happy. Then I noticed more and more things. Due to this character limit thing I’ll be brief.
 
- she would not talk to me if she didn’t get her way in the store buying something I have a strict budget and continued to nag me about buying stuff we don’t need 

- she really wanted nails and put that over paying her phone and then me paying that phone

- she got 2 more cats even though I didn’t want more cats and then after some pushing and pulling she gave one of them to a shelter she got attached to the female cat 

Now fun part -

The female cat ran away and she was sad about it. My gf managed to grab the cat but the cat scratched her and went back into the woods. I told her since she ran away no more cats they are expensive and that female cat exhausted my savings on vet bills. THE NEXT DAY she brought home a stray. And I was annoyed. I got home from work then started eating. I asked how long is it staying she said idk and I said u know how I feel about the cat being here. She was quiet. The I put it out for her either it goes or I go. She got upset and started getting flustered that I didn’t want the cat. I basically told her I have compromised on every aspect of this relationship and u can’t compromise on this one thing? Now’s she’s in the living room. Talking to her friend about the situation too.

We used to live in the same city, but I moved due to my parents' job 5 years ago. We stayed friends, and I recently moved back for college. I live in student accommodation with a strict curfew, where my parents are informed if I'm not back on time.

One Saturday night, Emma got drunk for the first time with two college friends. She drunk-dialed me to tell me she loved me. I was out running errands but quickly returned to pack my backpack and accompany her home. I called her friends several times, asking for their contact info, Emma’s live location, and their address so I could pick her up. They said they’d send the details but kept hanging up. After 3-4 tries, I yelled at them to send the info. They eventually did, but Emma’s live location turned off shortly after, and I only had half of their address. It would take me an hour to reach that part of the city, but my roommates stopped me, saying it wasn’t safe for me to travel as it would be midnight by the time I returned.

Worried Emma might have been drugged, I called her friends again. They said they’d call an Uber for her but wouldn’t accompany her home, which worried me more since Emma was very drunk. I decided to call her mom, telling her Emma was drunk and that her friends wouldn’t drop her off. I sent her the friends' contact numbers. I hesitated to call her parents because they are strict about alcohol, but I didn’t have her cousins’ contact information.

I live with my friends, a girl (22F) called K is dating a guy (21M) called R. I was friends with K and R before they started dating. They got together 4m ago and it was a bit awkward, they both talk to me about their dating life and that's always been fine until now, coso it's about each other. It makes me feel uncomfortable at times knowing so much and I feel like I should ask for some boundaries but I also don't want them to feel like they can't talk to me if they need. 

my group are planning arranging accom for next year, K won't be joining us cos she's moving to Japan, I asked R if he wanted to join us as there was still room flat. He said yes and I booked a second viewing for 2pm next day, he asked if I wanted to get lunch with him before as he had an hour spare before, K was free at this time but he didnt invite her, which I thought was wierd as he's been busy recently and they havnt had chance to see each other much. ( I did ask him why he did invite her and he said , he assumed she'd be busy, again this was wierd to me)

next day i wait at bus stop. I get a text of K that my other friend need to go to ane and she's taking her, its not serious and not to worry. I ask to keep be updated.

R arrives, we go to a cafe. we talk a little, then he started talking about his relationship with K, he felt bad for not having time to see her (this made me feel awkward cos he was spending time with me, im still confused why he didnt ask her to lunch originally). While we were talking K texted me, asking what we were doing and talking about. 

Later on: My other friend told me that at ane that K was talking about R and how he wasn't spending time with her and other friend was annoyed because K was ignoring her in pain

K asked me to ask R if he was angry or sommat, is that why she dindt get invited. both were talking to me about the other one and I had a panic attack. R noticed and he was sorry for stressing me, that I won't be in the midle again and said that I should tell K that he's just been busy and she shouldnt be messaging me so much about just getting lunch with him. she kept messaging me all lunch

We went to the viewing. After I said I needed to go shopping and he joined me to get some stuff too, we shop at different stores but he came with me and then i went to his with him. We walked back to the bus stop outside my house, the was in 3mins, he would have come in to say hi to K if it wasnt gonna be there so soon. 

when I got in she asked me how it went, i said good and that we went shop after, i think it made her more pissed.

I felt like an awful person for hanging out with my friend. should i have asked if it was OK to get lunch with him alone? They could have lunch together so she has a right to be annoyed at him? Should I have told him to not come shop with me? I feel I've messed up here, I need opinions from non friends

I live with my friends, a girl (22F) called K is dating a guy (21M) called R. I was friends with K and R before they started dating. They got together 4m ago and it was a bit awkward, they both talk to me about their dating life and that's always been fine until now, coso it's about each other. It makes me feel uncomfortable at times knowing so much and I feel like I should ask for some boundaries but I also don't want them to feel like they can't talk to me if they need. 

my group are planning arranging accom for next year, K won't be joining us cos she's moving to Japan, I asked R if he wanted to join us as there was still room flat. He said yes and I booked a second viewing for 2pm next day, he asked if I wanted to get lunch with him before as he had an hour spare before, K was free at this time but he didnt invite her, which I thought was wierd as he's been busy recently and they havnt had chance to see each other much. ( I did ask him why he did invite her and he said , he assumed she'd be busy, again this was wierd to me)

next day i wait at bus stop. I get a text of K that my other friend need to go to ane and she's taking her, its not serious and not to worry. I ask to keep be updated.

R arrives, we go to a cafe. we talk a little, then he started talking about his relationship with K, he felt bad for not having time to see her (this made me feel awkward cos he was spending time with me, im still confused why he didnt ask her to lunch originally). While we were talking K texted me, asking what we were doing and talking about.

67,1fqg2er,AITA Problematic encounter with a guest,"Hi
So I had a problematic encounter with a guest at work today and wanted to know if I was the AH in the end.

So, a group of guests had drinks at the restaurant I work at. 
I didn’t take their first orders because I was doing something else. My colleague did, and they were happy.
Later on, one of the group members came up to the bar and made a new order with me. He ordered a few drinks and a wine.
My colleague told me she would pour the wine, so I took care of the rest.
As I finished the order, the men had already paid but also mentioned that the wine that was given to his table was the wrong color. I checked and he was right.
I apologized and he still wanted the previous wine.
So I brought it to the table and asked about the wrong wine. He said that his friend had already sipped it.
My answer was just okay, and I went back. (They were busy talking and drunk, plus that was just awkward.)

The reason my colleague poured the wrong wine was because he had previously kept ordering the same one.
Anyway, that was our mistake, and I do not deny that. He paid for the wrong one, which was a bit cheaper too.
But in our minds, it was also obvious that he needed to pay for the second wine since they were drinking both in the end. (And we can't just give out drinks for free.)

Before the closing, I approached them and asked if there was anything else they would like to order, but they were fine, so I informed them that they needed to pay for the second wine. He adamantly refused, arguing that it was our mistake and that since this is a finer restaurant and they were the guests, they should not have to pay for it.
I argued back that he wouldn't have to pay for it if the first wine came back to us, but they drank both.
We argued back and forth for a minute. He wanted to give me his number so my manager could call him the next day and they could talk about it(or even now in the middle of the night) , as he absolutely wouldn't pay. Otherwise, he told me to call the police on him.

We argued calmly but were also both annoyed when he said that when I came to ask about the wine, I, with ""apologetic"" movements, just okayed the wine situation and shouldn't come back after they drank it all, expecting them to pay when it was our mistake.
I did partly agree, so I gave up. It wasn't a bottle, just a glass.
So my colleague and I paid for it.

The more I think about it, I can see how I could have handled it better. First, when I brought the wine, I could have directly mentioned that he would have to pay for it, or even before that, just so we are all on the same page.

I'm also a non-confrontational person, and this was the one time I tried.....and hated it.

69,1fqf3lx,AITA for telling my friend’s bf that he is the worst?,"I (22M) have this solid group of friends. We’ve been tight since we were literal kids, we were always together and we played at our school’s soccer team. One of the guys (let’s call him Steve) came out to us in our last year of school and it was heavy. He was literally sobbing like a wreck, and we had no idea what to do at first. First time I ever saw my dude cry like that, and it was intense. But whatever, it’s our friend right? So we just kinda took it in stride. We were shocked for like a minute but after that nothing changed. He’s our bro.

Fast forward a few years, we’re all in different colleges now but we make it a point to keep in touch. We play soccer when we can, plan trips, the etc. But things have been... complicated recently. Steve’s got his first actual boyfriend now (he dated girls before but obviously it wasn’t like real). At first we were all happy for him specially after all the stress he had to endure coming out. But man, this guy is the WORST (We’ll call him Chad). He’s super possessive, like on another level. Dude is practically glued to Steve, all jealous and toxic. He’s also constantly talking shit about me and the other guys, saying we’re bad influences, can’t be trusted, blah blah. It’s seriously starting to mess with Steve’s head, like he’s always anxious or walking on eggshells when Chad’s around.

The guys and I have been planning this sick trip for December, we’re going skiing to Canada. It’s been months in the works cause we barely get to hang out with each other nowadays. So outta nowhere Chad texts me directly, doesn’t even go through Steve, and says Steve can’t come on the trip. Apparently Chad’s super paranoid about Steve staying in the same hotel room as us. He straight up said he doesn’t allow his boyfriends to have male friends and that he’s been “making an exception” for Steve but now it’s gone on too long.

Dude was acting like we’re out here tryna fuck with Steve. What the actual fuck bro? I got so pissed. It felt like he was implying that just cause Steve came out we’re all secretly trying to get with him. As if we’re supposed to stop being bros with him just because he likes dudes now?? No man, it’s not like that.

So I snapped. I told Chad he’s a controlling insecure piece of shit and that Steve deserves way better. I might’ve said something along the lines of him being the worst thing that’s happened to our friend group in years. But seriously, who the hell does this guy think he is, trying to pull Steve away from us like that? He’s acting like being gay means Steve has to only hang with girls now or some bs.

Now Steve’s all quiet and hasn’t said much to me since the blow up. I don’t want to lose my bro but this guy is literally toxic as fuck and I can’t just let it slide.

70,1fqeiom,AITA for not allowing my mother to be involved in planning my grandmother's memorial?,"My (46f) maternal grandmother passed away a couple weeks ago. It wasn't a shock, she was very sick with Alzheimer's for years.  I was very close with my grandma we were friends and I loved her very much.

For a little background, my grandmother had really rough life and needed intense therapy to even function when my mother was little.  As such she developed a cleaning obsession, it was extreme, but everyone else managed to deal, but my mom held deep resentment.  She ended up emailing a horrible letter to my grandmother making a lot of, unfounded, accusations.  She completely blew up what little relationship she had with my grandmother, and it never recovered.

When my grandmother passed, there was a little inheritance left to be split between my mother and her siblings, after funeral costs.  My mother and 2 of her siblings started planning her arrangements, though a lot of things were already in place, I wanted to be included in the planning because of how close we were, my aunt and uncle had no issues with it but my mother said, we were only going to have small graveside ceremony, which included throwing my grandma's ashes in the already paid for plot by my grandpa and that's it.  She had convinced my Aunt and Uncle that no one would show up except us anyway.

I'll be honest, I lost it.  I told my aunt that I had already posted about her passing on facebook and have had few people asking about the funeral already.  Long story short my aunt and uncle put me in charge of setting up a memorial, which I am happy to do.  

When my mom found out she first tried to convince me that we could do a ceremony graveside, I said ""No, I am doing a proper memorial for MY grandmother.""  She didn't say anything to that except ""Fine""  The next day I find out from my aunt that she and my dad are trying to book buildings for the memorial and discussing the food we'd bring for the luncheon I decided to do.  My aunt said I was in charge and I told my parent's I already had a building booked and I will think about her suggestions, but if I need help I'll let her know.  She is pissed.  She claims she was never against a memorial, the graveside was just a 'suggestion'.  I agreed to put a hymn my mother wanted which is fine but otherwise have sidelined my mother.

I don't think I'm in the wrong because she did not want the memorial and didn't even like my grandmother, but this is my mother's mother. AITA?

Edit; just a quick edit because people are getting hung up on the cleaning thing.  I'm sorry if it sounded like I was dismissing  my mother's feelings around it.  I have never read the infamous letter, I refuse.  I only know that it hurt my grandmother very much and that people that were actually there when said events happened dispute what my mother says happened.

I did not side line my mother because she didn't have a good relationship with my grandmother, I only included that to illustrate WHY she didn't get along with my grandmother and why she, probably, didn't want a memorial. I side lined her because she got petty and mad when my aunt and uncle agreed we could do a memorial and put me in charge.  She went behind EVERYONE'S back and tried to do her own memorial.

72,1fqdrp6,AITA for giving a classmate my Instagram without asking my parents permission ,"I (20F) currently live at home with my parents. I’m in college, unemployed, and they cover all my expenses—food, phone, tuition, everything. I’m genuinely grateful because I know I’m in a fortunate position, but there’s a downside: I don’t have much say over a lot of decisions in my life.

Since they’re paying for everything, my parents are involved in most aspects of what I do. For example, I can’t choose my own classes without their approval since they’re covering college. I’m not allowed to download apps without permission because they pay for the internet. And I can’t just hand out my phone number or talk to new people without their say-so because, well, they pay for the phone.

That brings me to the current issue: I recently shared my Instagram with a classmate without really thinking about it. I haven’t been hiding it either; I’ve been messaging her in the living room because, honestly, at twenty years old, I should be able to give my Instagram to whoever I want.

However, based on my past experiences, I’m anticipating a blow-up. Two years ago, I gave my phone number to a classmate, and my dad absolutely lost it. I was 18 and thought I didn’t need to ask for permission anymore, but my dad disagreed. He lectured me for over an hour about it. now, I’m just waiting for a repeat of that blow-up when they find out I’ve been messaging this new classmate on Instagram.

I’m frustrated because I know their rules are overbearing, but they’re paying for everything. I know that since they are paying they have the right to make rules, but i feel like I’ll never get to make decisions for myself if I don’t start pushing back. My friends called me an idiot for going against my parents, saying I should appreciate my circumstances because they would kill to be in my position.

A bit of extra context:
I don’t think my parents are strict—they’re just very involved. As for being unemployed, it’s not by choice. I’ve wanted to get a job for years, but my dad’s convinced me not to. Also, I want to add that im not lounging around doing nothing. Keeping the house clean is pretty much my responsibility. I do everyone’s laundry but my older sisters. We have four dogs and three cats, and taking care of them is mostly on me too. 

So, AITA for not asking my parents’ permission to message a classmate? Should I just accept their control because they’re paying for everything, or is it fair to push back a bit?

Since they’re paying for everything, my parents are involved in most aspects of what I do. For example, I can’t choose my own classes without their approval since they’re covering college. I’m not allowed to download apps without permission because they pay for the internet. And I can’t just hand out my phone number or talk to new people without their say-so because, well, they pay for the phone.

That brings me to the current issue: I recently shared my Instagram with a classmate without really thinking about it. I haven’t been hiding it either; I’ve been messaging her in the living room because, honestly, at twenty years old, I should be able to give my Instagram to whoever I want.

However, based on my past experiences, I’m anticipating a blow-up. Two years ago, I gave my phone number to a classmate, and my dad absolutely lost it. I was 18 and thought I didn’t need to ask for permission anymore, but my dad disagreed. He lectured me for over an hour about it. now, I’m just waiting for a repeat of that blow-up when they find out I’ve been messaging this new classmate on Instagram.

I’m frustrated because I know their rules are overbearing, but they’re paying for everything. I know that since they are paying they have the right to make rules, but i feel like I’ll never get to make decisions for myself if I don’t start pushing back. My friends called me an idiot for going against my parents, saying I should appreciate my circumstances because they would kill to be in my position.

A bit of extra context:
I don’t think my parents are strict—they’re just very involved. As for being unemployed, it’s not by choice. I’ve wanted to get a job for years, but my dad’s convinced me not to. Also, I want to add that im not lounging around doing nothing. Keeping the house clean is pretty much my responsibility. I do everyone’s laundry but my older sisters. We have four dogs and three cats, and taking care of them is mostly on me too. 

So, AITA for not asking my parents’ permission to message a classmate? Should I just accept their control because they’re paying for everything, or is it fair to push back a bit? I’m really torn.",0.0,1.0256425,1,0

These neighbors boys, high school age, who I know from other younger neighbor children to be bullies and trouble makers, are down there with their bikes and bags. Right next to us they are talking to this younger boy who walks up, he says he’s 11, and the older boys are like “oh I hear you’re the newest member…” and then they are having this kid go steal alcohol for them at our local corner store. He was protesting like “nah, they don’t let bags in at all, blah blah blah” but the three older boys push him into it, tell him to go right now and do it, and he does. Im trying to get out of there n mind my business, but my son is screaming to stay in the puddle and play more. I scoop him and start to leave but have to pass back through on my way home and at that point the kid is back with the stuff he stole and the older boys are giving the younger kid one of their bikes with orders to rob a different local store for them. Talking about how they could use some twisted teas. These are locally owned, small family bodega style corner stores already barely staying afloat. I was still gonna mind my business because I dont want beef with these neighborhood kids… but, as im leaving, these kids start making gross comments about me and the fact that Im in a wheelchair behind my back. I look back and them and make hard eye contact and, at this point, I’m just pissed. So they know I’m onto them. 

As in passing by the corner store they had the little boy rob first, the women who works there happens to be sitting on the steps and starts a convo with my son and I. At that point, I was pissed off by these boys behavior and so I told the employee “those older white boys with the bikes are trouble. They’re sending the little kids to steal” and I know she went back in, found the alcohol gone and called the cops. 

Now I’m paranoid these boys are gonna target me and my son. I’m concerned they will know I snitched and that now I made enemies (who are bullies) in my neighborhood… it makes me anxious to take my son out, but this is all literally on our street… and my son deserved to play outside.

Basically the president of a club I am in told me at the beginning of the semester about a bunch of events she plans to do. I am graduating this semester and am a student teacher (f24). I told her I’d try to help but not to count on me because my busy schedule. 

However last week I messaged her asking if she needed a performer or assistance for her event next week. If she did I’d be willing to provide either services. She never responded. Then the night before the event Leah, (former president and my friend) asked if I was going to the event tomorrow. I said I likely would and can help but the new president isn’t responding to me so I’m not sure. She then said they needed someone to livestream and the new president was probably busy so I should message or call again. I said I would reach out again. 

I didn’t get a response until the day of the event. Her first message was her basically saying if I came she’d likely have something for me to do, then she next text (3 hours before the event) she asked if I could not only livestream but record it all. 

Now I could’ve still gone but 1. I truly was occupied by the time I got her message and 2. I just didn’t want to go or help anymore especially after she didn’t respond to my offer last week or last night. So I told her: “Hey, I’m actually going to be busy, I was unsure if my assistance was needed and I got occupied with a different engagement. Sorry for any inconvenience”

Now Leah is mad at me and says I am an unreliable person. She also said that she “vouched” for me to the president and said that I sounded like I was going to the event and seemed willing to help. I told her I did until I got a response the day of, but she thinks her calling me last night should’ve been enough.

I was president of the club last year and Leah inserts herself into club matters even though she’s not an active member anymore. Last year when I was president Leah would get upset that I wasn’t doing enough with the club but it was because none of the members, including the current president, would ever show up.

81,1fqaymy,WIBTA if I stopped walking my elderly neighbors dog?,"So, I’ve been helping out my elderly neighbor by walking his dog for a few months now. He’s old and has trouble getting around, so I figured I’d help out since I’m already walking my own dog anyway. At first, it was pretty manageable because it was on my own schedule, and I didn’t mind doing it when I took my dog out.

But lately, it’s starting to feel like a bit much. I work from home and sometimes walk around my complex during business calls. When my neighbor sees me, he’ll ask if I can walk his dog, even when I’m not walking mine. On top of that, he’s started texting more and more asking me to walk the dog at random times, and it’s just becoming a little demanding.

To be honest, I just don’t feel like walking the dog anymore. It’s not the best on a leash, and it’s way more hyper than my dog, which makes it a lot less enjoyable. I feel bad, because I know he needs the help, but I’m also feeling taken advantage of and don’t want to be responsible for someone else’s pet anymore.

I hate not being able to be 100% sure that I’m selecting the right meet up place because I’m not physically there. I hate having to deal with someone else’s money. I just don’t like the idea of doing this. I’m in the spectrum if that helps anyone understand me.
The reason for her to ask me to call an Uber for her is because many times her account is in debt with Uber (using the “pay later” option) and she doesn’t have the money to pay it and still go home after work. So she calls me and asks me to do it. 
I have paid her debt once so she wouldn’t have this problem but she just went into debt again. So I messaged her and told her to please stop asking me to do this. I explained that I understood that was strange the way I felt but that I really felt like dying everytime she called me to ask this.

We met in college and were both nursing students in our final year. Kate has been extremely helpful with my academics and of course I help her out whenever I can with what she lacks.

As great of a student Kate is, she has a notorious reputation for never coming to class. I totally understand that sometimes professors are not helpful with their teaching style, however, Kate has missed several of our clinical placements citing either mental health crisis or physical health. I really do try to understand but it’s week after week that she’s either sick or going through something and I’ve been having a tough time believing if it’s even true.

She’s also missed EVERY single presentation we’ve have the whole 4 years of nursing school. Because of this, her friends and myself included would rather not have her in our group presentations as we know that the day of, she will bail citing a fever or something.

So exactly how do these all affect me? Well she texts and calls me all the time about how fellow students and school staff are targeting her about her attendance. It’s always an excuse of “I got sick” or “I have anxiety”. And for it to happen every week, of course people start to doubt her reasoning. 

Her most recent rant set me off. We’re in the same placement group and so far she has not attended any placements. School admin has contacted her and informed her that she cannot make it to the next semester with inadequate hours. She ranted to me that it’s not fair, she has problems, blah blah blah.

It may not be a big deal, but this is YEARS of hearing this dialogue from her. I’m so tired at this point. Her calls would last 2-3 hours and would eat my study time or my sleep. I’ve tried telling her to keep it short but she keeps me on the phone regardless of my time constraints. Even at work, she calls my office phone. I’ve tried to establish clear boundaries that she could not respect. Ultimately, I decided to cut her out.

I’ve already had a conversation with her regarding these issues but she called me the asshole for abandoning her in her time of need. Nursing school is hard and I need to focus on myself. AITA for doing this? Should I have approached it differently?",TL;DR,2024-09-27,"AITAH I cut my friend off after 4 years of friendship.

93,1fqzz9q,AITA for ruining the birthday party of my friend because of a fight with my boyfriend,"So, me (26M) and my boyfriend (32M) went to one of my friends birthday party, it was the first night I was seeing them in months. They all know and like my boyfriend.
At some point me, my boyfriend and a friend were chatting, and the subject of being gay came up.
My boyfriend made a comment around the lines of “since I grew up without my dad and my grandma raised me, maybe that’s why I’m gay”
At the beginning I just felt like it was a joke, but still debated to him that it couldn’t be the case, that being gay is not a cause of trauma. I was calm at the beginning.
My boyfriend grew up a bit more traditional than me, and I felt like it was his internalized homophobia speaking out.
He stuck to his statement and little by little the conversation got more heated. The friend that was also having the conversation with us sided with my boyfriend, saying that he has the right to his opinion. To which I agreed. But I kept saying that if that is his opinion, he needs to understand the implications of it, that if being gay is a a cause of trauma, 1. You are seeing being gay as something negative, and 2. You are suggesting that being gay can be ‘solved’.
Anyways, I was visibly angry, but wasn’t raising my voice or insulting anybody, yet I am sure you could see it in my face.
My boyfriend got upset because he said that he feels like he can’t say anything without me getting angry.
The discussion lasted more than an hour, and everyone at the party noticed that we were fighting.
At some point we were just silent and not speaking to each other, and it felt like it was going to get resolved, but once I tried to explain myself again, he kept to his version, saying that he felt attacked by my mood. And that even if he knows I’m right, that he wants to be able to share his thoughts without it being a big deal.
I felt like the fight had already ruined my mood and every one else’s, so I told him I wanted to leave. That the night was ruined.
We’re live in the same house but still are not speaking to each other.
I understand that i maybe got too defensive, but I feel like I am right, and the fact that I corrected him, even if he wasn’t serious, made him feel like I attacked him.
But he doesn’t understand that him and my friend being on the same side, over something so stupid, made me feel like I had to defend my point of view.

94,1fqznau,AITA For wanting a gift I gave my mother back instead of her giving it away.,"I'm posting this for my mother.

Years ago she gave her mother a stuffed camel that my father had bought while he was deployed to Turkey a good 20 years ago. Now that she is getting older my grandmother has been giving away quite a bit of her things. She originally tried to give the camel away to her neighbors kid, but he didn't want it. 

So my mom told her she would like it back to give to either one of my kids or my brother's kids.My grandmother stated that she would probably just give it away to one of my mother's sisters that live in another state than all of us. 

So my mom wants to know would she be the asshole if she presses the issue and continues to ask for it back since it is kinda sentimental to her. Or because it was a gift my grandmother can just give it away to whoever she wants to.",Not enough info,2024-09-27,"AITA For wanting a gift I gave my mother back instead of her giving it away.

95,1fqzlq5,WIBTA if I returned my parents grad gift to them?,"I (22F) graduated from college last May and received a $25 Starbucks gift card from my parents (both 60) as a graduation gift. Now, I'm not someone who needs a huge gift or anything, but this hurt my feelings for other reasons.

Firstly, though my parents don't care about this, I've been participating in the Starbucks boycott for months now (this has been incredibly easy for me for reasons that will become obvious). Secondly, even if I wasn't boycotting, I still wouldn't use the gift card. I don't like coffee or tea. I have never liked coffee or tea. This is something my parents know as I repeat it often when they ask if I want anything or to try their drink. I know that Starbucks sells food, but I honestly don't even like their food offerings that much, either. Especially not enough to go out of my way to get them. Lastly, my dad bought a bunch of gift cards from Starbucks for his company this past winter as part of a little raffle thing. I'm almost certain my parents gave me this gift card not because they went out of their way to get me something, but because they had it lying around. To be honest, that almost hurts more because it shows it wasn't even ""special"", it was just convenient.

It's now been over four months and I still haven't used the gift card and have no plans to. Here's where I venture in AH territory. They don't even know how I feel about this. They sent it to me in a card and technically don't even have confirmation I received it. If I give it back to them (my dad goes to Starbucks like every other day so he would certainly use it), I know they'll ask where I got it. I see no point in lying to them, and I'd just tell them it was their graduation gift to me. As far as I can remember, and I've racked my brain, this was their only grad gift to me so it wasn't a part of something larger. I want to reiterate again that I don't expect a lavish gift, but it hurt my feelings to see how little thought my parents put into something for me. A selfish part of me wants them to know it hurt me and wants to hurt them back. WITBA if I gave it back to them?

EDIT FOR CLARITY: I’ve gotten a few comments about this so I wanna address it in the post! My parents paid for my tuition and I paid for rent, groceries, etc. I did NOT expect ANY graduation gift. I would’ve been happy with nothing more than my tuition paid. The part that hurt me was that they gave me a gift without thinking about if it was actually something I’d want or just because they felt obligated to gift me something. It made me feel more like an obligation than a daughter. I mentioned it wasn’t part of something larger in reference to it wasn‘t like a part one of two gifts or something in case people asked. Clearly I anticipated the wrong question haha! I’ll add more information as people request it and I’ve appreciated everyone’s inputs, regardless if they’ve called me ungrateful or if they know what it’s like to have parents who just don’t care as much as you wished they did. Thanks all!

2ND EDIT: This isn't about the gift and whether it was a ""good one"" but how to deal with the fact that it shows my parents don't know me as a person and don't seem to care to learn. I'll reiterate that I never expected a gift, but the gift card symbolizes to me that they just have no clue who their kid is.

96,1fqzjlz,AITA for kicking out my sick dad?,"I(26F) recently moved my dad(62M) in with me after a huge health crisis. He had a seizure while out at lunch and it turns out he had a massive meningioma/tumor in his brain, which was removed along with a piece of his skull. He has surgery next week to put the skull bone back in.

He was never very active in my life. He had another family before getting my mom pregnant when she was young and impressionable. He’d leave us for them and vice versa. He was always financially irresponsible, leaving my mom to borrow money from relatives to make rent. She eventually left him and he faded away.

I always adored my dad. When he was around he was the only person in my household that was kind to me. He picked on my brothers and they picked on me in return. My mom resented me for loving him so much because of all the suffering he caused.

After my mom left him, I defended him. I was so naive. Eventually, I tried moving in with him. He dropped me off at an uncles house and I lived with him and other family for a while. He never got his shit together enough to have his own place. He doesn’t like to work consistently. He is reckless and I’m sure has mountains of debt unpaid because he runs from his responsibilities. He got me a debit card when I was 16 and when I got my own bank account he started using my account and regularly runs it into the negatives and it’s under my name. I moved back in with my mom after becoming a  homeless teen because of him. 

I left home as soon as I could. When I became a single mom, I got my own place. A one bedroom duplex. I work my ass off to have my tiny house for my son and I and for the first time in my life I feel happy in a living space. I’ve decorated it how I like and my son has his own nook for reading and for all his toys. My lease is a month to month and my rent is cheap. If the landlords found out I moved him in I am positive they would kick me out. 

When my dad had the tumor removed, he had nowhere to go. I decided to take him in. I put all of his hospital bills under my address because he’s homeless. I helped him more than anyone else. His kids from his first marriage want no part of it.

He’s been with me for almost two months now and I can’t take it anymore. He stays in my living room. He never leaves the house. I am stuck in my room with my son when I come home from work. My son is miserable. My dad tries to step in and parent him and parent me and police me and I can’t fucking stand it anymore. I was going to let him stay with me until he recovers from his next surgery but I can’t do it anymore. I’m his youngest of 9 kids. I’m a struggling single mom. 

Tomorrow, I am making him take me off of the bank account. When he goes into surgery I am telling the hospital he is homeless and needs to be placed in a nursing home. I am consumed with guilt but he’s never respected my boundaries. I love him deeply and I fear he will never speak to me again.

97,1fqzjbx,AITAH for telling my friend universities will think she's cheating?,"I (16F) have been with the same friend group since I started high school. We've clicked really well, but one of my friends has always been a bit salty and sarcastic around me. I figured this was nothing special since she is like this with some of the rest of our group (not all of us), but recently, she's really been getting on my nerves (won't respond to important texts I send her, didn't even write when I invited her to my cousin's bat mitzvah). I'm not one to hold onto grudges or past annoyances, but these little things have started piling up and have made me pretty.

Recently, we had a class together and were talking about grades. My friend is one of ""those"" people who gets high nineties in all her classes and brags about her lack of sleep, which I've always found a bit annoying, but kind of looked past it because we are friends. So we were in class and she was bragging about getting a perfect 100 in her summer chemistry course (compared to my 85, which I was actually proud of) and I made a comment along the lines of ""Well, universities are going to think you hacked your mark if you don't apply to Ivies"" in response to her saying she was planning on only applying to small universities from around our area. I only meant this as a joke, and sort of as a compliment as well, saying she was only suited for Ivies.

Well, I guess this really ticked her off because for the rest of the class, she ignored me, and when we left, she said something like ""Don't make comments about me cheating."" I told her it was a joke and I was sorry, and she responded with ""You really piss me off, don't talk to me"" and stormed away. Since then, she's been really cold towards me, which I've found strange, as the joke I made towards her is definitely something she would say to someone else (she makes a lot of snarky comments about my grades and ethnicity which I've chosen to look past).

I've been thinking a lot about this and I don't know if I'm being a jerk or if she's being overly sensitive.

I was obviously suprised at this, though I thought it was because my aunt was busy the next day (my cousin and aunt live with my grandmother), but my mom decided to confront ME, for not offering my bed, my grandmother apparently didn’t want to sleep on the bed like couch and was to uncomfortable, she could have spoke and told me so I could offer it, but she decided to talk to me, not my other siblings, me, the only one with a head injury, as I didn’t want to argue with my dear mother, I told her off and ignored her insults. She eventually said and I quote: “I will force all four of you in a room so I can make space for my family, I am apparently an idiot for not caring about my family before you”

I was obviously suprised at this, though I thought it was because my aunt was busy the next day (my cousin and aunt live with my grandmother), but my mom decided to confront ME, for not offering my bed, my grandmother apparently didn’t want to sleep on the bed like couch and was to uncomfortable, she could have spoke and told me so I could offer it, but she decided to talk to me, not my other siblings, me, the only one with a head injury, as I didn’t want to argue with my dear mother, I told her off and ignored her insults.

99,1fqygxr,AITA for not agreeing to a new rent split with roommate?,"My roommate and I live in Canada, our total rent is 2800. We recently moved into a two bedroom apartment, one bedroom is slightly smaller and doesn't have a window. The other room has a window but it leads to a sunroom - it gets OK natural light/airflow.  All other factors are shared and the common spaces account to about \~80% of the rest of the apartment. Neither room is very big.

Prior to moving in, we had a showing together and agreed I can get the larger room for a premium because he wanted to save money anyways and was grateful that I found the place since we both struggled to find housing. We agreed I would pay 150 more than him and could talk again if needed. The other day he asked how much more id be willing to pay and I said I can do 250 more than him so 1525/1275  since I think that's fair.He is now insisting we do 1650/1150 instead...

I find this number to be fucking stupid, he constantly complains and throws tantrums about his room getting too hot and I sympathize with that. However, hes never tried getting a fan, or properly explain why he thinks that rent split is fair besides the fact hes now realized he hates the lack of a window (airflow, light etc). I'm willing to work on how much I pay but I'm not willing to meet his every demand. He's now saying he would be willing to pay that much for my room which would've been fine by me if he wanted to discuss this further before we moved in (I planned my room accordingly and bought stuff for it based on layout).Instead of communicating with me, he went on a trip with his girlfriend right after we signed the lease so it seems he kinda just agreed without thinking about anything and now that hes back and fully moved in these issues are arising.

At one point they messed around and he was completely honest about it with me. As of right now, I’m working 2 jobs to pay bills as his position was eliminated and it’s been tough finding a job where he has experience. 

I met Melissa one time and we talked and everything was fine. This past week, he’s been to her house 6 times. Twice in one day. To me this is weird and really not something that would be considered normal when in a serious relationship. 

My last relationship was hell after being with a narcissist for 2 1/2 years so I’m still trying to recover from that. I’ve made my feelings known and had conversations with him that this isn’t something I’m comfortable with at the moment. We’ve had multiple conversations about it.

He constantly tells me that I have nothing to worry about and that he’s not cheating on me, that he helps her with “man tasks” that she can’t do and her kids are there most of the time. 

Today was the 5th day he’s been to her house and I lost it. I told him that I’ve repeatedly mentioned that this isn’t something I’m comfortable with at the moment and that I need time to get there. I also mentioned that going to another females house, regardless of if it’s your best friend or not, 5 days out of the week isn’t something that really any female would be okay with. If I was doing the same thing, he sure as hell wouldn’t be okay with it. 

He tried to guilt trip me by saying fine, I’ll just tell her we can’t hang out anymore and that I can only come over when she needs me to do something. I told him nope! Go over there. I don’t care anymore because I’m not being listened to anyway.

107,1fqx387,AITA because I want my gf to stop getting tattoos? ,"I (32M) met my girlfriend (28F) close to a year ago. She has since moved into my house and things are going pretty well overall.

When I met her, she was pretty heavily tattooed; almost a complete sleeve on one side covering her hand, more on the other arm, and knuckles done on both hands. She once told me that she wanted a lot more, and while I'm fine with the tattoos she has, I really don't want her to get any more. She hasn't gotten any since we've been together, fortunately.

All of her tattoos are well done, but 95% of them are not meaningful. Just a bunch of random stuff all over. It's pretty unnecessary, and I really like being able to still see some of her natural skin.

Since expressing my opinion about this, she has told me she would be fine with not going to the extent of sleeving out her arms and legs (thank god) but she still wants to get her other hand tattooed because ""it looks bad with only the knuckles done,"" which is such a stupid reason. It looks fine.

I told her she can do whatever she wants, but that I can also do what I want, and I don't have to stay with her if I don't like it. She started crying about it, asking how I could say such a thing. But I'm not stopping her from doing what she wants; I'm just saying I don't have to stick around if I don't like it.

When I met her, she was pretty heavily tattooed; almost a complete sleeve on one side covering her hand, more on the other arm, and knuckles done on both hands. She once told me that she wanted a lot more, and while I'm fine with the tattoos she has, I really don't want her to get any more. She hasn't gotten any since we've been together, fortunately.

All of her tattoos are well done, but 95% of them are not meaningful. Just a bunch of random stuff all over. It's pretty unnecessary, and I really like being able to still see some of her natural skin.

Since expressing my opinion about this, she has told me she would be fine with not going to the extent of sleeving out her arms and legs (thank god) but she still wants to get her other hand tattooed because ""it looks bad with only the knuckles done,"" which is such a stupid reason. It looks fine.

I told her she can do whatever she wants, but that I can also do what I want, and I don't have to stay with her if I don't like it. She started crying about it, asking how I could say such a thing. But I'm not stopping her from doing what she wants; I'm just saying I don't have to stick around if I don't like it. I might end up liking it, but I just really wish she would stop or get smaller, less visible ones.",1.0,1.064393401145935,1,1

My mom filed for divorce against my dad. He discovered she’s been unfaithful to him for years. It’s already enough on me and my siblings as is dealing with this. 
He doesn’t think she deserves half of what he has, since he has a good amount of money. 
He wants me to offer a settlement outside of court to her and explain why she doesn’t deserve half of his money, I am already mentally physically and emotionally very drained and don’t want to get involved. I explained to him that it’s too much on me and if a lawyer do this on his behalf. He doesn’t agree with me and says “You guys (my siblings and I) aren’t worth it to him” and he’s better off just leaving us with no support just because we don’t want to partake in the messy divorce. I told him I can simply ask her if she’s willing to take an offer but he insists that i give her a whole “presentation” on exactly why she doesn’t deserve anything, her wrong doings, things like that.

109,1fqwyu9,AITA for asking my bf not to yell at the dogs while I’m sleeping? ,"My bf works on the road all week and comes home on weekends. We have three dogs who get really excited when he comes home, and I get that it’s overwhelming; they irritate me sometimes too. However, he has a habit of overreacting to their excitement by yelling at them instead of remaining calm, which is how you get dogs to calm down. 

Last weekend, he came home while I was napping and freaked out at them, startling me awake and putting me in a pretty sour mood. I have trauma from being startled often as a child and so it takes a long time for the cortisol rush to leave my body, and I hate that because my time with him is already short as it is, and I never want to spend my already-limited time with him feeling frustrated with him. He knew I was napping, and if I ever screamed while he was asleep, it would be a HUGE problem for him. 

I texted him a few mins ago to tell him I was gonna take a nap and, pretty respectfully, asked him to please not yell at the dogs when he comes in. I told him I was excited to see him, etc. He responds by saying he will yell at them if he needs to and I don’t need to text him that. I was like ummm, you wouldn’t appreciate me yelling at them while you’re sleeping, and I don’t appreciate it either, so I’m giving you a heads up that I will likely be asleep when you get home.

110,1fqwvl9,AITA for not letting my mother live with me?,"I am a 29F that recently moved away and bought a house with my husband and little son. A little backstory about my mother and my life growing up. Since around 8 years old, my mother would leave my sister and I alone at home. She would go work or just go out clubbing with her friends. At around 15 years old, my sister started rebelling against me. Whenever I would inform my mother about something bad she would do, my mother would yell at me instead. Growing up, I knew I couldn't speak to my mother because she would just lash out. I grew up somewhat depressed because we also lived in a filthy home with other family members. My sister, mother, and I shared a bed and room while living together. She met an abusive man and moved him in. She forced my sister and I to leave the room and sleep in the living room. About 12 years ago, she met her current partner that is a married man. His family knows about my mother. I do not agree with the relationship, but its her problem. Fast forward to 2 years ago, I had my son. She started showing up to my doorstep unannounced at whatever time she wanted even after telling her to please call beforehand. Right before I moved across the state, she was involved in a car accident. My sister was now living with her and took the burden of the financial situation. After my mother recovered, she still did not go out and look for a job. My sister got engaged and told my mother she was moving out. My mother spends all day in bed, scrolling on her phone endlessly, and pretends to be dumb. While living with my sister, she would give her sister (my aunt) groceries because my aunt is another one that likes to rely on people for everything. While my mom was working before, she would prefer to not have enough money for rent and give money to her sister. This caused my sister to pay rent in full every month. My mother is homeless now because she did not think my sister was actually moving out. My sister would get home from work and my mother would wait on her to apply for jobs for her. My mother knows how to use technology, she even knows how to make tiktok videos. Not even me. She has been traveling allover the US basically crashing in people's homes. Instead of looking for jobs, she prefers to stay in bed all day. She once mentioned to me that my life is easier because I have a husband and she's single. I then told her that she's been with a married man for years and it's her fault. I have been sending her money every month to help with her bills. Unfortunately, its been over a year and I see no change. I am in a tough situation because I care about her, but I also do not want to live with her. I do not want to cause issues in my current peaceful life by having to bring her in. Many years of my life were spent thinking of the day i was able to leave that home away from her.

111,1fqt98r,AITA for not giving back a gift that my ex-best friend gave me?,"A few months ago, my friend gifted me a spare pair of noise-cancelling earplugs, as I'm autistic and I get very irritated/distressed when I hear other people chewing. One of my other friends and many of my family members are pretty loud chewers, so to stop me from being constantly exposed to distressing sounds, she gave them to me. 

I experience a lot of issues with my memory and often forget to bring objects with me when at school. For some two weeks, I would often forget to bring in the earplugs. However, this soon stopped and I ended up using them religiously for several months. They bought extreme satisfaction and amazing results. However, during August, my friend accused me of never using the earplugs and abandoning them, because she 'never saw me use them' and demanded I give my gift back to her. I understand her point, as I usually keep my hair over my ears and tried to put on the earplugs discreetly, as I've had many confrontations in the past where my distress for somebody's loud eating had offended them, so I tried to hide when I was putting them in to avoid that. I've also witnessed many autistic people in my school get harassed/bullied for using noise cancelling objects, so that also drove me to keep them hidden. But to say I never used them was pretty unreasonable, as I had openly used them in front of her outside of school, and struggled to hear her talking with them in to a noticeable amount. Now it's September and for this reason and several others, me and my ex-friend have stopped being friends and we don't talk to each other. Now she and all of her friends are asking me to hand the headphones back to her.

During P.E, I remembered that my earplugswl were in my bag and I was ready to give them back, even if my ex-friend had two other pairs and they stopped me from distress during school lunches. However, the earbuds had gone missing from my bag, and I suspected them to have been stolen. I wait until today to tell this to her girlfriend, who tells it to her. Now my ex-friend is demanding that I find the stolen earbuds by Monday, or I owe her £20. Should I still pay her the £20, even though she has spares and she gave it to me, meaning it was my property, or so I tell her that I don't owe her anything? And if so, how do I say this without causing conflict? 

EDIT: I looked around my bag a bit and found the earplugs case, but without the earplugs?
