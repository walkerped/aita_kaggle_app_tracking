0,1frbma4,AITA I said no to a weekend away and my friend is being difficult about it ,"This weekend, a beloved friend is having a birthday party in the countryside, about 40 people there, 5-6 hours from where we live. I was looking forward to it & confirmed my attendance months ago. 

About three weeks ago, my estranged brother decided to attend. Instead of telling her directly, his girlfriend reached out to the birthday girl. I haven‚Äôt seen my brother in over two years. Our relationship has always been strained.

With the help of a therapist, I‚Äôve recognised my brother was socially-sexually dominant. He had sex with many of my close friends (at least 8), including once in front of me on holiday, in the bed I was supposed to sleep in that night. Also, I am trans & he refuses to use my pronouns. Since the estrangement I am able to be happy in ways I didn‚Äôt think possible. 

When I discovered he would be there, I panicked. I know the weekend is about the birthday person, not me. Context: I am sober (nearly two years from drugs, 18 months alcohol!), & the party would be boozy & lots of drugs. I feared that without a physical escape (it‚Äôs in the middle of the countryside), I might turn to drugs/alcohol for a ‚Äòpsychic‚Äô escape. I made the difficult decision not to go & sent my apologies to her, promising we‚Äôd celebrate together later.
I made my peace with not being there & planned fun activities. Also, I had a deadline on the Friday.

At 11 a.m. on Friday, 1st day of the party, I received a text from a friend‚Äînot the birthday girl‚Äîtelling me my brother had dropped out & asking could I come? I explained that it was difficult to make changes at such short notice: hundreds of pounds on a train ticket, further half hour taxi from the station.

She suggested I skip the fare; I said I couldn‚Äôt risk the fine. She said I could catch a lift with someone else; I declined again, she accused me of being ‚Äúspiky‚Äù & a bad friend for not ‚Äúmaking an effort‚Äù for the birthday girl. I asked please can we stop talking about this, it‚Äôs bringing panic. She only decided to go 2 weeks ago, after breaking up with a partner who she otherwise was going on holiday with. This is also the same friend who had sex with my brother in front of me, they dated for a few years & we repaired our friendship after they broke up.

I had a panic attack, home alone (all housemates at the party). When another friend came to pick me up for our evening plans, she found me crying & shaking. She soothed me (I am so grateful), but the texts didn‚Äôt stop, insisting that if I truly wanted to be there, I would have made the effort.

I previously asked people to discuss the weekend elsewhere, said I was muting social media, which other friends respected. I haven‚Äôt heard from the birthday girl or anyone else at the party. I said this morning ‚Äúplease stop‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoy your weekend, stop thinking about me‚Äù.

It would have been a strange mindset had I decided to go at the very last minute. It is a house in the middle of nowhere. Am I a bad friend for not doing so? AITA for repeating my no?
