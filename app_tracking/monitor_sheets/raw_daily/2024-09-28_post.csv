0,1frbma4,AITA I said no to a weekend away and my friend is being difficult about it ,"This weekend, a beloved friend is having a birthday party in the countryside, about 40 people there, 5-6 hours from where we live. I was looking forward to it & confirmed my attendance months ago. 

About three weeks ago, my estranged brother decided to attend. Instead of telling her directly, his girlfriend reached out to the birthday girl. I haven‚Äôt seen my brother in over two years. Our relationship has always been strained.

With the help of a therapist, I‚Äôve recognised my brother was socially-sexually dominant. He had sex with many of my close friends (at least 8), including once in front of me on holiday, in the bed I was supposed to sleep in that night. Also, I am trans & he refuses to use my pronouns. Since the estrangement I am able to be happy in ways I didn‚Äôt think possible. 

When I discovered he would be there, I panicked. I know the weekend is about the birthday person, not me. Context: I am sober (nearly two years from drugs, 18 months alcohol!), & the party would be boozy & lots of drugs. I feared that without a physical escape (it‚Äôs in the middle of the countryside), I might turn to drugs/alcohol for a ‚Äòpsychic‚Äô escape. I made the difficult decision not to go & sent my apologies to her, promising we‚Äôd celebrate together later.
I made my peace with not being there & planned fun activities. Also, I had a deadline on the Friday.

At 11 a.m. on Friday, 1st day of the party, I received a text from a friend‚Äînot the birthday girl‚Äîtelling me my brother had dropped out & asking could I come? I explained that it was difficult to make changes at such short notice: hundreds of pounds on a train ticket, further half hour taxi from the station.

She suggested I skip the fare; I said I couldn‚Äôt risk the fine. She said I could catch a lift with someone else; I declined again, she accused me of being ‚Äúspiky‚Äù & a bad friend for not ‚Äúmaking an effort‚Äù for the birthday girl. I asked please can we stop talking about this, it‚Äôs bringing panic. She only decided to go 2 weeks ago, after breaking up with a partner who she otherwise was going on holiday with. This is also the same friend who had sex with my brother in front of me, they dated for a few years & we repaired our friendship after they broke up.

I had a panic attack, home alone (all housemates at the party). When another friend came to pick me up for our evening plans, she found me crying & shaking. She soothed me (I am so grateful), but the texts didn‚Äôt stop, insisting that if I truly wanted to be there, I would have made the effort.

I previously asked people to discuss the weekend elsewhere, said I was muting social media, which other friends respected. I haven‚Äôt heard from the birthday girl or anyone else at the party. I said this morning ‚Äúplease stop‚Äù and ‚Äúenjoy your weekend, stop thinking about me‚Äù.

It would have been a strange mindset had I decided to go at the very last minute. It is a house in the middle of nowhere. Am I a bad friend for not doing so? AITA for repeating my no?

1,1frm51w,AITA for telling my mom what her husband said to me?,"My (16F) mom got married a few months ago. She's been dating her husband for 3 years before that. My dad died 6 years ago. My mom and I had a talk a couple of weeks ago. She told me she noticed I'd been a bit more distant and she wanted to check in with me because I was never that way. She also mentioned how uncomfortable I look sometimes and how she hates it. She wanted me to tell her anything and said it would mean a lot to her if I could be honest, no matter what. So I was honest with her and admitted that it made me a little sad to see her with her husband. That I'm glad she's happy, and I want that for her. But I can't help feeling sad it's not dad making her smile and thinking it should be him. I told her it's not a big deal but it's still an adjustment for me seeing them being all couple vibes.

Mom hugged me and told me she was sorry she hadn't checked in with me better on how I was doing with that. I told her it was okay and I loved her. She seemed a little upset and I reassured her the best I could so I got another hug.

A few days later my mom's husband approached me and asked me why I had to say that to mom and whether I was trying to break them up or make mom feel like she couldn't be affectionate with him around me. He said on top of everything I made her feel like a bad mom. Then he said I was old enough to know there are things you keep to yourself no matter what. He told me he'd tried to step in as a dad but I clearly hadn't wanted that. So he stepped back. But for me to have an issue with him loving his wife was too much. I could see he was pissed.

I sort of knew mom wouldn't have liked that but she asked me after noticing some tension in the air so I told her what he said to me. My mom was so mad at him. They got into a fight. And later my mom's parents got involved and both of them and my mom's husband told me I shouldn't have told mom what he said. That it really looked like I was trying to stir up trouble.

2,1frm4au,AITAH for thinking my sister is jealous of me? ,"So me (18F) and my sister (21F) have never had a great relationship, when we were younger she went through a really bad depression which made us grow apart for a really long time, I started distancing myself from her cause she would often hurt my feelings with comments and jokes about my appearance or personality traits.
So recently we started going to the gym together and in order to actually make some progress I started bulking, toh I used to be incredibly skinny so l've gained quite a lot of weight at this point and I still wouldn't consider myself bulky, but my sis and my mother haven't stopped making comments on the fact that l've been eating a lot more, and to be completely honest they didn't really affect me since l'm used to receive those type of comments but recently I've been growing insecure on the fact that maybe I've started to actually look fat (even though l'm making a lot of progress at the gym) because of all these comments and looks. As a note here, my sister quit the gym and isn't disciplined at all when it comes to good habits.
When it comes to comments and stuff like this she criticizes me a lot which makes me really insecure on the way I dress, talk, express myself etc. Another example is the way I like cutting my hair, I'm really into grunge music so I try dressing alt, I've cut my hair many times and I really love having a wolfcut. Whenever I change anything in my appearance I immediately feel insecure and seen by her (and my family in general).

We've had intense arguments and she only tells me what she really thinks about me when she is upset, she has said things such as claiming I try excusing myself from being a bitch by saying l'm ""too sensitive"" (1 include this cause I have an open mind about this, I admit this might be an actual possibility). I consider myself very tolerant with abusive people, I often remain silent when someone is rude to me. For some reason my family thinks l'm rude and often aggressive with people, I don't see this at all and other people beside my family view me in a completely different way. I also think I am indeed quite sensitive, friends have told me it's a big flaw in me and toh this really breaks me down (ironically).
Its been this way my entire life and the more I grow the more I feel attacked and undermined by her which has led me to think she is jealous or angry at me in some twisted way.
Anyways, please feel free to comment, I have an open mind about me actually being the asshole, if you have any questions please ask them.

4,1frltp8,AITA for wanting to kick my roommate out before he may need knee surgery?,"Late last year I (36m) went on a date with this guy whom I quickly realized I was not compatible with, but I was open to friendship. He was going through a rough patch because he was an immigrant from Turkey (we live in the United States) and had injured his knee at work. He was stressing out because he was worried he'd have to go back to Turkey (his whole family was there and he didn‚Äôt have anyone here to help him) and could be separated from his dog whom he really loves. I felt bad for him because I could imagine how I'd feel in that situation. I'm also a huge animal lover so I understand the fear of having to give up a pet and not knowing if they're going to a home that will give them the love they're accustomed to for the rest of their days. He was also stressing because he had whittled down his savings account while the United States dragged their feet on renewing his work visa. I figured I have a spare room in my home and since it'd only be for a few months while he recovered from knee surgery, I'd be a good person and pay forward all the great things I have in my life.

When we first moved in he was on crutches. He wasn't making up the story about his knee. I saw the x-rays and took him to surgery. I haven't told him this, but the several weeks post op were pretty difficult for me. I took him to his appointment and brought him back. It was an hour drive each way and I had to take the day off of work. His knee was in this thing which locked it in place while it healed and he had to wear it for an uncomfortable amount of time. I have an 85"" TV in my living room so we rotated my couch so he could lay on it and watch TV, play video games, etc while he recovered. I hated it because usually I like my house to be in order, and during this period it was in complete disarray but I kept telling myself, ""It'll only be for a few months and then he'll be on his way. Just a few months."" Also, because he had to avoid putting weight on his knee, he couldn't shower so the smell started to get intense and hasn't fully dissipated all these months later. I understood at that time, he couldn't help contribute to the chores because of his recovery and I knew he couldn't afford to help with the bills‚Ä¶ but it was supposed to only be for a few months. Eventually he healed enough to begin going back to the gym and taking his dog for a walk. So finally I figured, ""Oh good, since he's not helping with the bills, maybe he can start helping with the chores."" But boy, was I wrong. He'd wash his own dishes, but if I had left a plate in the sink, he would just move it out of the way. His dog‚Äôs hair also started fully coating the bath mats and I would ask him to clean them and he would‚Ä¶ only when I asked. I started just throwing them to the side because I hated getting out of the shower and getting dog hair stuck to the bottom of my foot (I‚Äôm a cat person). He‚Äôd cook and not wipe down the counters or stovetop. I‚Äôd find droplets on the floor in the kitchen, and my Roomba would wedge itself under the couch (he still spends a lot of time in the living room) and be there for DAYS. I‚Äôd be leaving for work, starting to feel claustrophobic because the house is getting so dirty and he‚Äôd be in the living room watching TV. I‚Äôd get home and nothing would be done. Granted, some of this was my mess too, but since he was living rent free in my home and it would only take maybe 30m out of his day, I had hoped he‚Äôd be gracious enough to help me out.

Finally, earlier this week, he sent me a picture of a note from his doctor saying he may need a revision on the surgery because there is still a tear and I lost it (politely). I explained that the electricity bill was $800 the previous month (I live in California and the state just lets PG&E charge whatever they want), his dog screeches and howls when I‚Äôm trying to sleep, and I work two jobs so I can‚Äôt keep up with the housework. He started guilting me that he only has a little bit of money that he needs but he can try to scrape some together. Then I told him that it wasn‚Äôt about the money. It‚Äôs about the fact that he‚Äôs home all day and doesn‚Äôt do enough to keep the house clean. He then gets indignant and claims he does clean my dishes (he‚Äôs done it a handful of times, I‚Äôve cleaned his more often), that he‚Äôs the only one who cleans the bathroom (I legit just scrubbed the ring off the toilet and sink with a pumice stone and bleach the other day and I regularly sweep the floor/bleach the toilet bowl), and then he acted like me never wanting to hang out anymore is a talking point. This was over text message and after that I just stopped responding. I was at work anyways.

He moved in in December of 2023, it is almost October of 2024. He did pay for a cleaning service to come twice, but that was it. He sent $100 to me in February for gas/lunch while he was in surgery. He cleans his own dishes and when I‚Äôve asked him to clean he has, but never of his own accord. I‚Äôm not a neat freak, but I do like a base level of cleanliness.

HIS DOG: His dog is pretty well natured and not super destructive that I have seen. I haven‚Äôt seen the inside of his room since he first moved in but his dog spends a lot of time in there. It has zero obedience training or impulse control. 100% of the time when he sees me he wants to tackle me and lick me. He doesn‚Äôt like being alone, even for a minute so when he is left alone in the room, he HOWLS and SCREAMS. It sounds like the dog is being tortured (he isn't, he is just spoiled).

And yes, I‚Äôm aware my people pleasing/conflict avoiding ways are partially to blame here. But I worry if I tell him to leave that he‚Äôll end up having to surrender his dog and go back to Turkey. I don‚Äôt want that for him. I actually wish the best for him, but I feel like I‚Äôm being taken advantage of at this point and just want my home back.

5,1frlo1c,AITA for being ‚Äúrude‚Äù to my cousin?  ,"I (27f) do not live in the same city as my parents due to my job. But I try to visit once every couple of months or so. My cousin (32f) still lives at my uncle‚Äôs which is next door to my parents thus she‚Äôs always there almost every day, they‚Äôll meet one way or another. 

Usually when I visit my parents it‚Äôs only for 2 to 3 days and I would like to spend that time with my parents mostly by ourselves or with my siblings if they‚Äôre there. I‚Äôm a very introverted person and I don‚Äôt like to share my news with anyone aside from my close family and my bestie. Sometimes I would like to discuss my news and personal things with my parents (taking their advise/ briefing them of things etc) but my cousin seems to be always coming all of a sudden unannounced, we‚Äôre having lunch she comes by, we‚Äôre watching tv she comes by, we‚Äôre having a conversation she comes by, sometimes for more than 5 times a day. 

It‚Äôs honestly very stressing at times especially that she doesn‚Äôt seem to have any understanding of personal space and privacy, I be cooking and she just barges in checking pots and things without permission, checking my clothes, asking if she could borrow them (I always say no, I don‚Äôt like sharing clothes and she knows) but she always seems to just ask anyway. And a lot of other very annoying things. 

Today I was very irritated as I was trying to have a private conversation with my mom but she kept coming in to roam around the room even tho I kept trying to tell her we‚Äôre busy so I ended up kinda yelling at her that I really would like to spend some private time with my parents without any ‚Äústranger‚Äù with us. 
I kinda feel bad but as I said before these visits to my parents are my only way to communicate with them as I said previously I‚Äôm very introverted and struggle with phone calls and mainly don‚Äôt like them.

6,1frlk51,"AITA for ""forcing"" my stepdad to drive me to the train station every morning?","I (19f) live with my mom (46f) and my stepdad (37f). I attend a university in a nearby city, and for my first year I stayed in the university owned dorms. For my second year, we all decided it would be a good idea for me to commute from the local train station into the city. The station is about a 10 minute drive from my house, too far to walk. There is no other method of public transport I can use to get to the train station. 

Over the summer, my mom was admitted to hospital and she will be staying in there for the near future. The hospital is about a 40 minute drive from my house, but only a 5 minute drive from my grandparent's house (stepdad's parents). My stepdad has been staying some nights at my grandparent's house, and some nights at home. 

I start uni again pretty soon, and still have no other way to get to the station other than being driven, as I can't drive yet. This means my stepdad has to take me to the station in the morning before driving to the hospital in the morning, so will have to stay at our house most of the week. 

Earlier today, his parents picked me up to take me to work (something they have offered to do), and they started hinting that I was an AH for ""making"" my stepdad drive me. They said ""I was going to kill him"" by forcing him to do this every morning, and that he was ""not allowed"" to stay at their house anymore. I was extremely hurt, upset and angry about this. I have not forced him to do anything, and have mentioned a million times how appreciative I am of him. It just felt like they blamed me for my stepdad being exhausted, and it made me wonder if I might be an AH. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. 

Extra facts:

-my stepdad sleeps on the sofa at our house (his choice)

- we have recently remodeled my bedroom at home, setting me back financially so I can't afford to look for an apartment nearer/in the city

-my stepdad is at the hospital with my mom around 8am-10pm, but sometimes leaves in the afternoon to take some time for himself. 

-he has willingly agreed to help me and take me to the station.

EDIT/UPDATE:

okay, from some of the comments I've made it seem like I'm not helping him out at all. I didn't include it in the original post because I didn't think it was relevant, but I'm doing everything I can to help him out around the house, and I go and see mom often, which gives him a break. He wouldn't be there if he didn't want to be. I feel absolutely awful for him, I do, and if it could be me there instead of him I would be there 24/7. 

My mom has severe arthritis, where all the cartilage between her bones has degraded, specifically in her knees. She's in hospital right now working to regain her mobility. Aside from being completely fed up of being there, she is fine in her self. She has her own inputs on the situation, even though she can't control anything, and is against pretty much every potential option instead of my stepdad taking me. She doesn't even want me to drive and leave the car in the station, and as much as I don't want to upset her and go against her wishes in the situation she's in, I dont think it's fair to still make my stepdad take me when I'm able to drive and have a car. I'm in Europe, where driving is expensive, I've been having lessons for just over a year and have a test booked in for november. I'll be using my stepdad's old car as well, so I won't have to buy one just yet. I'm hoping driving will help everyone out and ease the situation. 

I have chatted to stepdad and he doesn't agree with his parent's viewpoints which I am happy about. I've told him a million times how grateful I am for his help, he seems to be okay with taking me but I know he's stressed. he goes in a morning to help her get dressed and stuff, ready for doctors and/or visitors, then from about 1-5 he comes home either to his parents and grandpa or to our house. he'll head back to have tea, but usually ends up staying later than they'd planned. Thank you to whoever commented about making him a coffee or something in a morning as a thank you, I'll definitely do that. He's been bringing food in from home for my mom to eat at the hospital (she hates their food) so I have also been the one cooking it. 

unfortunately we are low income, I can't afford to buy a bike or scooter to ride, my loan has decreased so I can no longer afford to rent. my grandparents don't have room for me to stay at their house and I also can't get to the city from there. The same goes for my bio dad. It sounds like a bunch of excuses, but I am explaining why the situation is a lot less than ideal. 

Yes I am not as independent as I would like to be for 19 years old. I know I am incredibly sheltered, I didn't know how to do my own laundry until this all happened. I'm trying to be as independent and responsible as I can. I'm getting a lift home from a friend who works in the area.

I live with my mom (60F), and as the wedding has been getting closer and closer, she‚Äôs been becoming more and more difficult towards certain situations. My parents have been divorced for over 15 years, and my mom absolutely despises my dad and his side of the family (for context). 

My sister‚Äôs wedding is relatively small, less than 90 people, with only around 8 or so tables. She only has one family table, with both my Dads and Mom‚Äôs side sitting at the table. Originally, she had my Mom sitting at a completely different table than everyone because she was worried my mom was going to be upset about sitting with my Dad. I kind of let her know that I thought that would make things so much worse, especially because my Dad was going to be sitting with my Mom‚Äôs side of the family and my Mom wouldn‚Äôt be, which would‚Äôve been a disaster. SO, she switched it, so that everyone was at the same table, because it‚Äôs for one night, and it shouldn‚Äôt be a big deal, especially when it‚Äôs for their daughter‚Äôs wedding, right?

Wrong. 

I stupidly told my Mom who she would be sitting with, because I have access to the guest list, and she LOST it. Threw her dress in the garbage, said she wouldn‚Äôt be wearing it, and that she had never been ‚Äòso humiliated in her life‚Äô and that she couldn‚Äôt imagine sitting with those lowlifes (aka my Dad‚Äôs side of the family).  During the entire planning of the wedding, my Mom has threatened to not show up to the wedding for multiple reasons: if her sister was invited, if she had to wear a certain colour dress, among other things. My sister has been incredibly accommodating to this, and has tried to cater to our Mom‚Äôs desires, because of course, she wants her at the wedding.

After the situation today, I kind of exploded on my mom, and called her selfish, and told her she may as well not bother showing up to the wedding if this is how she‚Äôs going to behave. I also said she‚Äôs acting like it‚Äôs her wedding and she‚Äôs going to ruin my sister‚Äôs special day, because everything has to be about her. My mom‚Äôs response was ‚Äòyou only had to tell me once, I won‚Äôt bother to be there then‚Äô. I feel like such an ahole, I had no right to say that to her, with it not being my wedding, I just don‚Äôt want my sister stressed and embarrassed by whatever hissy fit my mom is going to create on the day of the wedding now. 

AITA? Should I start grovelling? I don‚Äôt want my sister‚Äôs wedding ruined, but I think it‚Äôs inevitable now and I think it‚Äôs all my fault. I‚Äôve talked to some people about it and they all say my Mom‚Äôs acting insane and being selfish, but I just feel so guilty and don‚Äôt want my sister to have to deal with this. 

Update:

Just a small update, I have spoken to my sister about the situation. She‚Äôs upset with my mom and her behaviour throughout the last few months, but has been trying to accommodate her as best as she can. She‚Äôs not going to approach my mom, or beg her to come. She has affirmed if my mom makes the choice to not attend, the relationship is over and irreparable; all she was asking for was one night of civility for the first time in 15 years.

10,1frk191,AITA for asking my mother to share money?,"I grew up in a housing association house with my mother and two sisters. The house is near central London and it is a 3 bed semi. After I started Uni, my mother re-married and moved away with her new husband, leaving my adult older sister the house.

¬†The total rent and bills for the house is only ¬£1,400, because it is housing association. My sister (37) has rented out the other two rooms in the house ever since, and uses the money she charges to cover the full cost of the rent. She meanwhile has never worked a full time job, but is a part time yoga instructor and sells yoga mats. Her main job is teaching yoga at the company I used to work at (guess who got her that job). She goes on half a dozen holidays a year and treats herself to plastic surgery and other frivolous (imo) expenses.

My other sister (30) has just qualified as a nurse associate. The two of them rent out the other rooms, sharing one room themself to maximise the Airbnb yield so they don't have to pay any of their own rent. They do not pay a penny of rent themselves, and this has now been going on for 15 years. I am now married with two small children, and have managed to buy a very run down bungalow with money I have somehow saved while renting, working full time and holding a second part time job as an online teacher.

For the last two years, my mother said she was going to move to be closer to me and my children, and promised she would help us with school runs etc. She took my daughter (4) on house viewings with her when I asked her to come down and spend time with us. She told her she would be closer and see her more often. She put us through this for *two years*.¬† She decided to move near my sisters instead.

¬†My sisters told me they helped convince her to move near them because we would get more money as inheritance if she bought in the city, and she had to live near them because one day she would need care and they didn't want to have to travel outside zone 3 to do that.

¬†Anyway, the dust has settled a little. But while they were all off on their various holidays this summer, and I could only take my children for a two-day UK break, I started to feel quite bitter and question why, if I'm not going to get grandparent support, I shouldn't at least share in some of the wealth the other two have enjoyed for *15 years*.

¬†So I looked at the market rate which is ¬£3,400 - a full ¬£2,000 saving on what my sisters enjoy (and this is without bills -theirs are included). I told her if this was split evenly, we should each get ¬£666m and if she didn't want to pay it to me directly she could pay into the children's JISAs, as this sort of money could make a difference in their lives. After a week of thinking she basically just said no.

¬†So Reddit: AITA for asking my mother to share the wealth she is granting my other sisters?",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-28,"AITA for asking my mother to share money? I grew up in a housing association house with my mother and two sisters. The house is near central London and it is a 3 bed semi. After I started Uni, my mother re-married and moved away with her new husband, leaving my adult older sister the house.

¬†The total rent and bills for the house is only ¬£1,400, because it is housing association. My sister (37) has rented out the other two rooms in the house ever since, and uses the money she charges to cover the full cost of the rent. She meanwhile has never worked a full time job, but is a part time yoga instructor and sells yoga mats. Her main job is teaching yoga at the company I used to work at (guess who got her that job). She goes on half a dozen holidays a year and treats herself to plastic surgery and other frivolous (imo) expenses.

My other sister (30) has just qualified as a nurse associate. The two of them rent out the other rooms, sharing one room themself to maximise the Airbnb yield so they don't have to pay any of their own rent. They do not pay a penny of rent themselves, and this has now been going on for 15 years. I am now married with two small children, and have managed to buy a very run down bungalow with money I have somehow saved while renting, working full time and holding a second part time job as an online teacher.

For the last two years, my mother said she was going to move to be closer to me and my children, and promised she would help us with school runs etc. She took my daughter (4) on house viewings with her when I asked her to come down and spend time with us. She told her she would be closer and see her more often. She put us through this for *two years*.¬† She decided to move near my sisters instead.

¬†My sisters told me they helped convince her to move near them because we would get more money as inheritance if she bought in the city, and she had to live near them because one day she would need care and they didn't want to have to travel outside zone 3 to do that. And they didn't want her to end up living with them because then they¬† would have to pay a portion of their own rent. And a bunch of other disgusting entitled things.

My cousin (28M) just turned 28 yesterday and still hasn't moved out of my mom's house, he's been living here for 6-7 years now. He moved into my room 2 years ago 6 months after my 15 birthday. I only had the glory of owning my own room for a year and 6 months, I have always shared a room with my sister so I was so happy to finally get my own room. But now I'm thinking of getting my room back.

A quick background on my cousin, he has a daughter, 4, and he used to sleep in the living room for a year or two. He has my niece every two weeks on the weekends. Also here is the thing, my cousin has this mentality of how women are. He says all women are the same they just try to ruin a man's joy and take all of his money.

So my cousin keeps on saying that he'll move out soon enough. He told my mom that hopefully he moves out by December, but here's the thing about my cousin he hasn't paid rent in over than 6 months to my parents and doesn't really composate in food money for the week, we're a family of 4, 5 with my cousin.

He has also put me down because I don't buy him anything when I go out, my parents give me money to go out because I still don't work, he says, *gasp* wow you didn't get me anything I see I see, like hello your putting down a 17 year old while in your late 20's that's just weird.

So where I might be the asshole is just telling him bluntly and not reason with him on any terms even if he brings in my 4 year old niece as an excuse. And now since its my last year in high school I'm gonna start going to a university I need my own room for my studies and privacy, I'm not gonna share a room with my sister for the rest of her high school years on a bunk bed while I am going to university.

So I'm asking if I should tell my mom to kick him out the first two weeks of June because that's when I graduate high school and in the following month, July, is my birthday.

I appreciate all the feedback and the YTAs judgements. I'm posting because on some level I knew I could have handled it better and been a more supportive husband. I'm doing this to try and take stock of myself and things that need adjustment. Also beginning therapy soon, so maybe this was a preemptive strike on my part to open the floodgates to some behavior that needed to be checked. Thank you all.


My (45F) wife woke up this am and smelled something in the house. When I (42M) got up, I smelled it too, it smelled like vinegar, old food, and nail polish... I wasn't too concerned, because we have two kids that spill stuff and leave food in random places; And nobody had any headaches, nausea or dizziness. Wife and aunt talk and they proceed to call the gas company to come out to check the smell. I'm always a proponent of ""better safe than sorry,"" but I was 100% sure this was not gas from my experience. I was pretty irritated that she was calling them and I felt it was a waste of resources. 

We got into a bit of an argument where I was accused of not being protective of our family and generally too lackadaisical with my responses. My response to that was to call one of our contractors, just not the gas company since it's not gas! Apparently I'm the AH for that according to her. 

We have an attached single family, her aunt lives on the other side and she decided to call the fire department also. Now we have a gas truck, an ambulance, and a firetruck outside of the house, and neighbors are texting me asking if we are ok. Both the gas company and fire department seemed to look a bit irritated, I was embarrassed. 

Wife and aunt eventually called one of the contractors to come anyway, and he said ""just call me first next time if it's not gas"" which is exactly what I was saying. Again, there wasn't any dizziness, nausea or headaches so I wasn't concerned about anything serious. 

So, am I the asshole for being upset at their defcon 4 reaction to something I knew wasn't gas and wasn't causing us discomfort?

He‚Äôs also pretty vocal about having issues because of his albinism (stuff like vision issues and sensitive skin and things like that) I think those are genuine complaints. But his attention seeking behavior is what‚Äôs getting to me. Especially when he does this around girls and they tell him not to worry and he‚Äôs cute, it gives me second hand embarrassment.  


Yesterday we were out together, we were all chatting  and then he told us this one girl kept looking at him. We laughed and asked him if she was cute.

so my chest was growing and i was dragging a wagon while she still had her elementary school body. naturally, i started getting attention from boys in our grade, and older ppl too, and ig she didn‚Äôt like tht. 

fast forward to last month, ive had a couple talking stages here and there , and ive dated like 3 people since 7th grade (that‚Äôs important, remember that). so clarissa meets this boy named kj and they hit it off, like im talking they‚Äôre adorable tg , i loved them tg (for the most part) but kj was kinda weird.. everytime id be around he‚Äôd look at me like i was a piece of meat but suck his teeth after everything i said. 

one day i facetimed rissa to let her know i was coming over, (we‚Äôre juniors and i drive) and she said it was fine but what i didnt know was tht kj was also going over and we were both going to spend the night. once i got there i didnt have a problem with kj being over bc like thats my hgs bfn why should i care! but then kj starts being just mean like

when he went out to smoke , me and rissa made a couple tiktoks and i put on my pjs that i left there (unfortunately they‚Äôre super short and my wagon peeks through the bottom) so then kj came back and started laughing.. he asked rissa wtf i had on and asked me was i tryna steal him from her which i told him no and no one wanted him. he didnt like that and he told me that i was nothing but a slutty bitch and he wouldn‚Äôt let me turn his girlfriend into ‚Äúsomeone like you‚Äù (what does tht even meannnnn!) so then i called him a disgusting pig and a jerk and i told him tht he was weird for commenting on me despite not even knowing me , i then turned to clarissa and asked wasn‚Äôt she gonna say something, ANYTHING ? but she stayed silent so i just grabbed my things and left, right then and there.

I first met my husband when my son was only 2. I was a single parent with no help or involvment from my previous partner. When I got together with my husaband he respected my boundaries and my parenting choices. There were a few times that he questioned me but never anything serious.

When our daughter was an infant I would get up with her in the night, tend to her then put her back to bed. However when my husband got up with her I would wake up in the morning to find them both sleeping in the bed. I expressed to him my concerns about it, such as he couuld accidently roll over onto her and she was going to get used to it then we will never get her out of our bed, but he just said ""its alright, shes not hurting anything"". 

Now our daughter is 4. The week ago I was putting our daughter to bed and have been trying to get her off her cup at night because its bad for her teeth and because we are working on potty training overnight. Well she was fussing a little but I was talking to her and calming her down when my husband came in. He told me I should just give her a cup with milk in it because he wasn't going to listen to her cry. I tried to explain what was going on but he just kept on yelling at me. I told him that me, her doctor and her dentist have discussed that she no longer can have the cup and the possible damage it could do to her teeth.

Our parents picked us up from our dorm and on the drive home, Mom mentioned that we should visit our older brother's new place which is 3 hours drive from our home.

My little brother agreed but I had to say no because I have a practice exam for my preparation for board exam, so I need to go back to my dorm immediately, but I suggested my little brother can stay to come with our parents to visit our big brother and he could have more time with mom‚Äîit sounded like a great plan.

For some context, my little brother had asked our parents before if his girlfriend could sleep over, but they had said no. My mom also revealed she was okay with the girl coming over to hangout but not staying at my brothers room all alone for a sleepover.

Once we got home, Mom decided before we visit big brother she will first threw a small party to celebrate my little brother‚Äôs belated birthday and my graduation.

My little brother invited his girlfriend, but unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt really get to know her. Since she seems shy and she left early. 

After the party, my little brother surprised Mom by saying he wanted to stay home instead of joining our parents to the trip.

I couldn‚Äôt help but ask my brother why he changed his mind. He said he promised his friends he‚Äôd play basketball with them. I found it hard to believe that was really the only reason, so I pushed back and persuaded Mom to say no too.

My little brother and I ended up in a bit of a heated argument. He tried to convince me to let him stay, but I stood my ground and pointed out that if he stayed, he‚Äôd have to pay the bus fare by himself because Mom was planning to drop me off for free.

After a long back-and-forth, he admitted defeat and mentioned he‚Äôd have to tell his girlfriend their plans were off, which means it wasn't really about his friends playing basketball but more wanting to be alone with his girlfriend, but I got mom to agree with me for him not stay home alone and make him choose whether he comes with them or go back to the dorm with me, and now he is sulking and making it sound like I am against with his girlfriend.

When I was 15, my mom dated someone who was pretty toxic from the start, love bombed her and convinced her to buy a huge house together 5 months into the relationship.

I wasn‚Äôt there for it because I was stupidly privileged and got a scholarship to attend a really good boarding school, and only came back for breaks. So I met this guy at Christmas the first time and told my mom he seemed bitter and he made me nervous. She called me in the spring to say they‚Äôd bought the house, and I came home to live with him in the summer.

When I looked at him, he‚Äôd give me this twisted smile and slowly walk away. I was afraid to be around him. If I ran into him in a hallway, he made me squeeze around him and would snort or sigh angrily. I was spooked because I didn‚Äôt know him much, and I assumed he was doing way worse things to my mom, our dog, and my two little brothers (12M and 14M at the time) while I was away at school.

I talked with my brothers and we decided we had to leave the house so we wouldn‚Äôt be there when he came home, and we both told her we were terrified and couldn‚Äôt stay. Eventually she agreed to pack up and we stayed at a family friend‚Äôs.

The breakup was hard. He broke our bikes and home appliances, pissed on our clothes, out sugar in the lawn mower and stole things. He dragged my mom through court for her part of the house sale (which was way above her budget) and made her go into debt. Through it all, I was away again to boarding school and would come home to news and my mom feeling very upset. I supported her when I could and never really talked about it with my mom for years.

I also told her it broke my trust for her to buy the house and she said I shouldn‚Äôt believe parents need to make their decisions based on what kids think, that she regretted her choice but that at the time it wouldn‚Äôt have mattered what any of us said or felt.

I wanted an apology and most of all her just listening and seeing my reality of it, and recognizing that even though I wasn‚Äôt home much (which I feel terrible about) I was also his victim, and I just wanted my mom to stand up for us and protect us, and she wasn‚Äôt able to. 

Am I the asshole for wanting my mom (a survivor) to make space for my memories of living with her ex? ",,1.0114418268203735,1,0
24,1frgx0u,AITA for leaving my roommates?,"**AITA for wanting to leave my roommates after finding out one of them was planning to give me an ultimatum about our dog?**

So, I (24M) recently found out through a mutual friend/manager that one of my roommates (21F) has been talking about giving me an ultimatum for *over a month* now, but has never said anything to me directly. The ultimatum? She wants me to either give up our dog or move out. I was shocked when I heard this because she never once brought up any issues to my face, and now I feel completely blindsided. Mind you, we are a month at this point of having to move to a new apartment in NYC.

Here‚Äôs some background: A few months after moving into our apartment, my two roommates, who are a couple I met through work over a year ago (21F) and (25M) decided to get a puppy together. We all agreed that the responsibilities would be shared equally. But once the dog started getting bigger and needed more attention, *one* of my roommates (21F) just completely stopped helping. She acted like she wanted nothing to do with him, and even started showing signs of aggravation whenever the dog was around. I noticed this, but I brushed it off and took over most of the care because I love the dog.

Fast forward to now, I find out she‚Äôs been telling our mutual friend/manager that she‚Äôs planning to force me to either give up the dog or move out, but she‚Äôs never spoken a word to me about her frustrations. I feel like this was a fake and passive-aggressive move on her part‚Äîwhy not just be honest with me? I have a bad habit of giving too much grace but fear of being manipulated about why she did or didn‚Äôt tell me so hence why I‚Äôm here. 

I‚Äôm now seriously considering moving out because this feels like a huge breach of trust. I feel disrespected, and if she couldn't communicate about something this important, it makes me question if I want to live with someone like that. Regardless of this situation, I feel weird living with someone who would rather build resentment other than open communication. But part of me wonders if I‚Äôm overreacting.

26,1frgnyw,AITA for no longer inviting my friend when I go to the dog shelter?,"I 21F like going to the local dog shelter to help out. The shelter has a daily schedule when you can come take a dog for a few hours to hang out in the park near the shelter. The pups have time to run around and play and the people coming to walk the dogs have a good time too. I mentioned doing this to my friends (27F and 28F) and 28F became very attached to the idea, always asking when were finally gonna go. 

This weekend the three of us went to the shelter. From the very start 28F seemed to be in a negative energy. She decided she isn't gonna take a dog and will just walk with me and my dog and my friend 27F and hers. 

These dogs spend most of their days in cages so of course when we take them out they want to run around and sniff and pee everywhere. Of course they will occasionally pull the leash in the direction they wanna go and be a bit crazy running around, especially since the dogs we had this time were teenagers (approx 2yo). 28F was complaining the whole time that the dogs ""weren't well behaved"" because they weren't just calmly sitting there looking cute and were trying to lick her (which is basically kisses),etc. She was on her phone the whole time. Then she took some pics with the dogs and posted a ton of stories on Instagram saying she ""had so much fun helping the poor dogs at the shelter, playing with them"" etc. After that outing she texted us ""thanks for today, turns out walking dogs isn't much fun"". 

Its not supposed to be? I get that dogs makes everything seem like it should be loads of fun, but you don't go to a shelter to be entertained by dogs, you go to entertain and give love to the poor fluffy babes who don't have a family. 

Since 28F didn't enjoy the first time we went, the next time it was just me and my other friend 27F and afterwards we got some drinks and food. 27F posted to her story that we were hanging out. When 28F saw he story she said she was offended that we went out and didn't invite her. We explained that we didn't bring her because she didn't enjoy the experience, but she's still mad that we didn't bring her. AITA? or rather are we the AH?

27,1frg4wq,AITAH for telling my wife to back off caring for her step grandma? ,"So I, M40, told my wife, F39, that she needed to cool off caring for her step-grandma(SG), F92.

SG has been in her life since her teens.

My wife started out by just helping out here and there about 10 years ago after SG's husband died however SG's health, both physical and mental has declined a lot in the last 2 years. It's gone from my wife helping once or twice week to going every single day. We don't live locally so it's a 90 mile round trip.

SG has 2 sons, both live within an hour, one living just 10mins away yet do as little as possible

It's now got to the stage where SG needs residential care, she's been declared unsafe to stay in her own home due to physical & cognitive breakdown (dementia) by medical and social services.

Now in the UK if you have assets/savings over ¬£100,000 then you have to fund your own care. SG has assets/savings totalling north of ¬£650,000 so she's liable for her own care costs.

Both the sons are insisting that she doesn't need residential care, that she can manage on her own despite all evidence to the contrary.

Now I have a few reasons why I have said she needs to step back:

1. If the sons are so insistent then they should be the ones to care for her 
2. We have a child with SEN & I feel the amount of time she's at SG's, it's impacting on him 
3. It does have an impact on home life. My wife doesn't work as I earn enough for her not to but we agreed when she gave up work to have our kids that she would take the traditional housewife role, although I would still do my fair share. Because she's always out, her share of the household duties are getting done. When I do it all, on my days off work, I go to work and 2 days later, nothing been done again. This has happened since her care duties increased.

I personally feel that she's being taken advantage of and that the sons are not wanting to pay for the care because it means significantly less inheritance. Care facilities currently run around ¬£1200 per week. As things deteriorate then SG will need further care, upping the price. I estimate that should she live another 2 years, with the rate of decline then it'll wipe ¬£250k from the assets/savings

I also, and the bit that might make me the AH, think that myself and our kids are being neglected because of the time spent at SG's. I'm fed up of not getting much time to spend with my kids or her because on my days off I'm doing all the chores that have piled up in the week.

28,1frf7x2,WIBTA for not paying for my friends‚Äôs flight home? ,"**Group Roadtrip Logistics Drama**

Hiiiiiiii ! My (25F) friends and I are roadtripping to Northern California soon for a long weekend. The road trip will be about a 10.5 hour drive. 12 of us are attending the trip, all around the same age. Two couples, including myself and my boyfriend.

We‚Äôre all driving together from the same city except for 3 people who are getting themselves there. Only myself and one of my other friends have a car. I‚Äôm taking 5 people (Car A) and my friend is taking 4 people (Car B).

**CAR A (5 people):**

1. Myself
2. My boyfriend
3. My friend, who has met everyone else once or twice but is mainly my friend and second to that, is closest to my roommates.
4. & 5. My two roommates. 

**CAR B (4 people):**

1. The driver ‚ÄúBecky‚Äù who doesn‚Äôt live in the same city as us but is driving to our city to pick us up and drive to FL, as part of a longer travel period she‚Äôs taking.
2. My friend ‚ÄúLisa‚Äù who is very close with Becky
3. & 4. Our friends ‚ÄúBen‚Äù and ‚ÄúDaisy,‚Äù the other couple. Daisy is roommates with Lisa.

The cars our divided pretty logically, by household + the people we‚Äôre closest to. We‚Äôre all agreed on how we‚Äôre going to split gas, so no drama there.

HOWEVER‚ÄîBecky and Lisa, after our trip, plan to go on a second vacation of their own. Meaning, Becky‚Äôs car will not be returning to our city, and her passengers that need to go home (Ben and Daisy) will be stranded.

Becky is willing to drive them halfway home to an airport, where flights will cost \~$100-$150 to get home. I told them, while I can‚Äôt fit them in my car on the way back because it only has 5 seats, I‚Äôm happy to take their luggage so they don‚Äôt have to incur any extra fees.

Daisy is upset, feeling like the situation is shitty for her and Ben‚Äîjust because they happened to be placed in Becky‚Äôs car, they now have to take on extra costs. We‚Äôre going to discuss it this week, but possible solutions have been either splitting the flight tickets and across everyone going back or doing some sort of drawing early of who gets to go back in the car vs who is flying.

I personally don‚Äôt think myself/my passengers should be responsible for the cost of the flights. My passengers are coming with my due to their closeness to me, and they‚Äôre the people I want to spend the long drive with. Note, I was also invited to the trip with Becky and Lisa, but I felt too guilty to strand my four passengers.

Daisy is getting increasingly upset about the situation over text, so I know it‚Äôs going be a tense situation. She is quick to anger and blame others, and has already been butting heads with Lisa recently over roommate problems. Daisy is the kind of person to hold a grudge, and if we made them pay for the flight, she may make snide comments about it throughout the trip. As her roommate, Lisa feels a lot of anxiety about it and is trying to appease her--but I want to stand my ground and protect my passengers.

Just not sure the best way to fairly split the costs/logistics of returning home, while maintaining the peace.

* Background: We need the cars while we‚Äôre there, due to the activities we‚Äôre planning. I don‚Äôt want to rent a car, and I‚Äôm more than happy to drive. Again, myself and Becky are the only ones with cars and we happily volunteered to use our cars for this trip.

Grammar Edits: Please ignore the incorrect ‚Äú‚Äòs‚Äù in the title lol

EDIT FOR CLARITY: We have a shared Notes app Note for planning, and whilst making it, I was the one who divided the cars into these two groups. Again, it made the most logical sense due to the household + people we're closest to, but Ben and Daisy did not make the decision themselves to ride in Becky's car. It was a decision that for all intents and purposes, was made for them. So they feel they did't have any ageny and are being forced to pay extra due to something out of their control. I still feel like the cars are divided logically though and the current division makes the most sense. No one is going to volunteer to fly home.

Re: Becky and Lisa: They knew it was a good possibility that they would go on the second trip/not return home, but it was not officially confirmed until this past week. And the Airbnb was secured and paid for about a month ago. 

It would be far worse if Ben and Daisy didn't come--for the friendships and also cost, as we've all already split the airbnb. I would not ask them not to come, especially for this situation.

30,1frenqm,AITA for insisting my wife needs to watch our kids while I do chores?,"I (30M) and my wife (34F) have two young children, ages 1 and 2. They're a handful, as you can imagine. I believe that when chores need to be done, it's more efficient for one parent to do a chore while the other watches the kids. I'm always open to discussing and switching roles based on preferences and moods.

The issue is that my wife often gets upset with me for not being more productive while I'm watching the kids. For example, she'll cook dinner and expect me to clean the house while watching the children. I've explained that watching the kids is a full-time job, but she insists I should be able to multitask.

The frustrating part is that when I do chores, she doesn't watch the kids. Instead, she'll start another task like cleaning a room or doing laundry - things I'm willing to do if she'd just supervise the children. Without supervision, the kids naturally get into trouble.

This came to a head today when my wife burst into the kids' room where I was playing with them, upset that she was doing all the chores alone. I offered to do all the chores if she'd watch the kids, emphasizing that someone needs to supervise them. She didn't respond, so I went to clean the kitchen. While I was doing this, our 2-year-old climbed an exercise bike, got stuck, and had a meltdown.

I expressed my frustration about how she seems to never want to just watch the kids, yet gets mad if I do. There have been worse incidents in the past when the kids were left unsupervised. She accused me of attacking her.

AITA for insisting that watching our young kids is a full-time job and that we need to take turns doing chores and supervising the children?

Edit: I have no problem multi tasking. I just have a problem with my wife being unable to and thus giving me a more stressful time when we do chores. 

Also, we have a playpen. The two year old can get out of it and the baby cries when it‚Äôs left behind. 

Also I do have a carrier and I do simple chores hands on with the kids. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-28,"AITA for insisting my wife needs to watch our kids while I do chores?

31,1fref4c,AITA for not agreeing that I like a certain fictional character and would defend them with my life?,"Now, I know the title of this post is ridiculous (I agree, I never thought I would have to try and defend myself because of a personal opinion, but here we are.)

I (22F) am an avid gamer when I'm not working and my friends (21-25Fs) are as well, and we get together one or twice every week if schedules align to play video games together and just hang out. This past week we were playing Resident Evil 4 (Remake) and one of my friends (23F) started talking about characters we like and would defend with our lives besides Leon, and I didn't have to think much of it to answer, I said Chris Redfield, I didn't even notice I did anything wrong, until my friend who asked the question sneered and said that Ada was the right answer. I was so confused, I thought it was in OUR OWN opinion, so I said exactly that.

Suddenly, this friend got so worked up, she started crying about how I knew she was talking about Ada and how I was being mean and not choosing Ada when I know she needs to be protected, one of my other friends (21F), the youngest one there started comforting her and said that I was just joking. I had no clue what was going on, the friend crying hardly even wanted to play Ada's story, she always made one of us do it, she never mentioned Ada really unless it was while we were playing Ada's story, I had no clue she had such a strong opinion on her. One of my other friends (25F), the oldest out of us 4, voiced her confusion and said that this whole situation was ridiculous and this only caused the friend crying to start crying louder.

Somehow this entire thing turned into 2 vs 2 and now the friend who was crying and the youngest think the oldest and I are assholes and mean because we disregarded our friend's feelings when we didn't agree to her opinion on a fictional character we didn't even know she liked.

32,1frdmy2,AITA for not going to father/daughter dances with my stepdad?,"Out of 6 kids in my house me (16f) and my younger brother (10m) and my stepbrothers (15, 14, 13 and 11), I'm the only girl. My mom and stepdad got married when I was 9 which was 2 years after our dad died. Being the only girl and with my mom and stepdad not having any kids together, there was a lot of pressure on me to let my stepdad step into the full role of dad and what I mean by that is. I was expected to open up to loving him the same, treating him the same, and being the daddy's girl to him that I was to my dad before he died. And I was a real daddy's girl. He'd let me dress him up as a princess, do his makeup, he'd join me for tea parties, he'd pretend to be a ballerina with me, we'd do little shows together for mom and extended family. He was my favorite person in the world. My mom and I were never as close. Sometimes I think she wanted to be a boy mom and she has that energy sometimes. But dad and I were super close. 

So with my stepdad, I was supposed to basically let the same thing happen again. But I never wanted to. The difference is he always wanted a daughter, something he does talk about. I never wanted \*a\* dad. I wanted *my* dad and my stepdad just isn't.

I'm not his little girl, he's not my dad, I don't call him dad, I don't have his last name and I'm the only person who doesn't because my brother's last name changed to his. I don't ever ask for time with my stepdad or seek him out like I used to my dad. He's looked for me though and taken me places and done things with me and he's invited me to father/daughter dances with him or to take part in dad's and daughter activities. I never accept the dad/daughter stuff. I also never participate in anything Father's Day related that happens in my extra curricular's.

It kills him that all five boys are super close to him but I treat him more like the spouse of my mom than how he wants me to treat him which is like my dad. We did some therapy sessions a year ago (about 10 max) and I told him then that I wasn't looking for a new dad or to be his daughter. He told me it saddened him to hear that because he would be so honored if I'd accept him.

Our town is hosting this big dad/daughter charity dance and my stepdad pinned the flyer to the fridge and my mom told me how badly he wants to go and she said I should make him happy once and do it. I told her if I do, he'd get his hopes up that I'm coming around or they'd use it as an excuse for me to do it more with him. Mom said so what and I don't have dad anymore so why not accept the man who wants me. I told her it's because I don't want anyone but my dad for the role of my dad. She said I was being selfish and he's too good a man to do this to.

But actually the sheep does not live on the land because after I rented the land, she grows tomatoes and other vegetables there so the sheep doesn't go there.

She recently bought a designer bag for herself that is worth about 150-300$ when she was traveling, and when she came back to our country I started using the bag as well for my university. 
Now the thing is she didn‚Äôt like that and would say that she doesn‚Äôt want me to use her bag, which I totally do understand, but I have mentioned multiple times that I don‚Äôt have another bag that I can use since my last one is totally trashed. I asked her to give me some time so I can wait for the restock of a bag I‚Äôve found and that I would order myself one. 
Today, we were talking and she told me that she asked dad for money to buy me a new bag(which I repeatedly told her not to do, I have my own savings) and she showed me the same bag she has in different color. Now, I asked her that it is suspiciously cheap and it is probably just a fake and she said it was. I don‚Äôt like the fakes of the brands because I just don‚Äôt, even if it is 1 to 1 replica, I hate buying fake things knowing that I can save for a while and afford the real one. Anyway, I was like okay, I don‚Äôt care, because i thought it was at least 1 to 1 replica. 
They have just delivered it and it‚Äôs not. As a person that knows nothing about fakes and real ones most of the time, even i could see that this is an obvious fake.
Now a couple of things I want to clarify, I‚Äôm studying in a private university and people get shamed for using fake brands. I‚Äôve once been through this in school and i don‚Äôt want to go through this again. And also it was about 30-40 dollars and I wouldn‚Äôt mind if she bought just a random bag that I could use, but not a fake designer brand. I don‚Äôt know why but it makes me want to cry.


EDIT: thank you everyone for your replies, I decided to talk to her, mostly I was worried that she didn‚Äôt understand where I was coming from.

We sorted things out and she explained to me that she didn‚Äôt mean any harm which i understand. Now we have decided that I‚Äôm going to use this bag until I save for a new one, and hopefully people won‚Äôt notice anything about this one.

My choice is to leave the car in the road or park behind one of the existing cars. Drop-off is usually a 1 minute procedure and I'm not sure if the cars are another customer OR a staff vehicle. I choose a car without an owner at random and park directly behind it. I'm standing by my car with my dog waiting for a member of staff to come and collect him. A man appears and says ""ah, that's my car and I'm leaving in a few minutes"", this is a pain because I'm going to have to put the dog back in the car etc so I ask ""would you mind holding on whilst I drop him off?"" - genuine enquiry. He replies with ""yeah no problem"". I say thank you.

A minute or so later he returns with his dogs puts them in the car and starts going to town.

I'm selfish, I'm entitled, I'm a sub-par human, I'm arrogant etc etc - He's raging.

I said, I'm sorry, I didn't know it was a customer car, there was nowhere else to park, I'm standing right here and I asked you a couple of minutes ago if you'd mind waiting and you said it was no problem.

He replies - Do you need your ears cleaning out, do you understand, I said I don't mind waiting if you're an inconsiderate arsehole who thinks he's better than everyone else.

I said I'm sorry I didn't hear that, I heard you say ""you didn't mind"" - he then starts looking at my car and saying it's nice and shiny and new (it's nothing special, it's a corolla) and he had a piece of crap and he didn't care but wouldn't it be a shame if he damaged it whilst getting out (it was literally impossible for him to get out, so the implication was he'd back into it). I said (probably childish) why don't you give that a go and see. I was annoyed by his bully behaviour so figured I'd be stubborn.

He gets in his car and backs into mine. He does it gingerly but I hear the crunch of towbar on paintwork.

I go and take some photos of the damage, it's not immediately obvious so I'm down on the ground trying to work out if anything has happened, a scuff on the paint - not really an issue but I was more concerned that the bumper had pushed back or snapped a clip or whatever. As I do this he comes and starts filming me, pushing the camera in my face (not sure why it definitely wouldn't have been in focus) shouting about the damage on my precious car.

I stand-up and (I'm still calm) - Why have you done that for no reason, why didn't you just say you'd like me to move it as you had to go, I would have done so no issue. He remonstrates that he shouldn't have to do that as nobody should be as entitled to block someone in. It goes backwards and forwards a bit, I move my car. He leaves without providing his insurance details.

One night when my aunt needed to work late I offered to look after her kids (who are all much younger than me 5,6 and 8) and my sister wanted to come, so we went to her house and as soon as we step in the house my sister gives the house a once over and says ‚Äúthe house is so small, how can the children survive here?‚Äù I didn‚Äôt think she said it in a rude way just maybe not used to smaller houses so I reply ‚Äúthey have a roof over there heads, that‚Äôs all that matters‚Äù

After that we just sat down in the living room and helped the kids when necessary when it turned later I made dinner and we all sat around the dining table eating it was relatively quiet until my sister asked the kids ‚Äúhow does it feel having such a small house?

Hi guys, it‚Äôs only been a few hours but I already have an update, firstly thanks for all your opinions on this because I think I needed it. I have informed my parents + my aunt who were all appalled by my sisters actions and told me we are all going to have a ‚Äúchat‚Äù about everything tomorrow.

A few things that need to be said, after my sister left I knew I should‚Äôve handled it better and apologised to the kids for swearing in front of them and told them not to listen to my sister, they were confused on why she had left,for a little while but finished their food before beginning to play again like before.

My sister has always been a little spoiled but never this rude so it came as a shock to me, she‚Äôs also been in the house before (multiple times actually) and has never said anything about the size at all so confusing aswell. My mother is talking to her in her room as I type this so hopefully she will understand what she did was wrong and be able to apologise to our aunt tomorrow.

However, her reaction was‚Ä¶extremely distressing.

42,1fr9uru,WIBTA if I tell my new work friend she can't hit my vape anymore? ," I, 21F started a new job a few months ago where I made a good friend 27F and we immediately became work besties. But from day 1 she is always asking for my vape, going on all my sm\*ke breaks with me, etc. 

At first I was fine with it, I certainly don't mind sharing, but its become a constant thing and it's starting to get annoying. When I do have those few minutes on break to sm\*ke I want to enjoy them (yes i am addicted, i know its a nasty habit, please don't judge haha). Nearly every time I get up from my desk (to go on my sm\*ke break, to the rest room, to go for a meeting, to go to another department) she will immediately start looking at me like ""oh are you going to sm\*ke?"". Sometimes I even try and ""sneak away"" just so I can have those few minutes of peace from work by myself outside. And sometimes she legit asks me why I didn't tell her if I was going to outside and didn't bring her, she's even asked to borrow my vape and I have let her on a few occasions. 

It's started to become quite annoying and I went from jokingly saying ""oh u should get yourself one if you're sm\*king so much"" to quite seriously suggesting it, offering to help her pick one out, or mentioning we should get one for her when we walk past a vape shop etc.   She always says no because she ""doesn't sm\*ke"" and ""doesn't need it"" or ""doesn't want to spend money on that stuff"". But since she's been around I've quite literally noticed that I am going through my vape juice faster and needing to buy more more often which is becoming more costly for me. 

I love that I've made a good friend at work and I feel like I've mentioned that she's hogging my vape and that I'm going through more juice to her enough for a ""normal person"" to understand that they should stop or not ask so frequently or actually consider getting themselves one. But she still keeps doing the same thing and blowing it off with ""oh i just wanna take a few puffs"".

44,1fr92dq,AITA for not going to my best friend‚Äôs (27F) birthday party?,"Sorry in advance for any grammar mistakes, English is not my first language.

So, calling it a ‚Äúbirthday party‚Äù is kind of a stretch, but here‚Äôs what happened:

My best friend‚Äôs birthday was on a Monday, but on Friday she told me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make any plans for tomorrow because if I do something for my birthday, it‚Äôll be tomorrow. Of course, you can bring your boyfriend.‚Äù So I didn‚Äôt make any plans for Saturday.

The next day (Saturday), I asked her around noon if there were any updates on the plans. She told me she was having a really stressful day at work. So I assumed she wasn‚Äôt going to do anything, but I still checked in again around 3:30 pm. She responded saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired, all I want to do is sleep,‚Äù and mentioned more about how her day had been crappy.

By around 6 pm, I was at my boyfriend‚Äôs new house, which we‚Äôve been cleaning and organizing since he moved in a few days ago. For context, this is supposed to be our future home. My boyfriend asked if my friend had said anything about plans, and when I told him no, he suggested inviting his friends over to see the house. I was fine with it because I honestly wasn‚Äôt in the mood to go out anyway.

Then, 30 minutes later, my friend messaged me saying one of her friends was having a cookout at his place and she expected me to come.

I also apologized and explained that since she hadn‚Äôt mentioned plans earlier, I assumed there weren‚Äôt any.

So, calling it a ‚Äúbirthday party‚Äù is kind of a stretch, but here‚Äôs what happened:

My best friend‚Äôs birthday was on a Monday, but on Friday she told me, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt make any plans for tomorrow because if I do something for my birthday, it‚Äôll be tomorrow. Of course, you can bring your boyfriend.‚Äù So I didn‚Äôt make any plans for Saturday.

The next day (Saturday), I asked her around noon if there were any updates on the plans. She told me she was having a really stressful day at work. So I assumed she wasn‚Äôt going to do anything, but I still checked in again around 3:30 pm. She responded saying, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so tired, all I want to do is sleep,‚Äù and mentioned more about how her day had been crappy.

By around 6 pm, I was at my boyfriend‚Äôs new house, which we‚Äôve been cleaning and organizing since he moved in a few days ago. For context, this is supposed to be our future home. My boyfriend asked if my friend had said anything about plans, and when I told him no, he suggested inviting his friends over to see the house. I was fine with it because I honestly wasn‚Äôt in the mood to go out anyway.

Then, 30 minutes later, my friend messaged me saying one of her friends was having a cookout at his place and she expected me to come. I told her that I didn‚Äôt think I could make it because my boyfriend had invited a couple of his friends over, and it felt rude to leave them. I also apologized and explained that since she hadn‚Äôt mentioned plans earlier, I assumed there weren‚Äôt any.

46,1fr8hpa,WIBTA for uninviting a toxic person to our weekly DnD sessions?,"Hey all, some coworkers and I are about to be playing DnD together. I (f 21) will be Dming cause no one else wants to.

Initially, I approached 2 other female coworkers and asked if they would like to play DnD and start a group. It was a resounding yes. So I ordered the game. 

Well one of the two other women, I will call her Lee for anonymity sake, before we started, made it very clear that she wanted it to be a girls only group. To which I asked why (I had also invited my boyfriend and a few other male coworkers of ours who expressed interest). Her response was that she ""hates men."" I was like ""okay, I am sorry to hear that, just so you know DnD is going to be a mixed group because others have also expressed interest so I hope that'll wont be a problem!"" To which she sort of rolled her eyes and walked away. 

A few weeks later, she starts beefing with the other female coworker I had initially invited, lets call her Jane. Jane isnt a drama queen or anything but for some reason Lee decided one day that she had a problem with her and started picking fights. She then went to our manager and talked badly about Jane behind her back for at least an hour.

Its gotten to the point that Jane doesnt want to play with Lee. To make matters worse, when I made a grp chat initially and added all the interested parties, Lee saw there were men in it and ""jokingly"" said: ""This is girls only lmao bye (boys).""

It was awkward to be sure and not the vibe I wanted. Then the next week at work, she brought in some friends to dinner. I was serving them. She told me in front of these other girls that they are interested. In the moment to be nice I was like ""Oh great! The more the merrier!"" But deep down I knew I wasnt comfortable with hosting more than the people I had invited.

Now I am a first time player/ DM. I do not feel comfortable Dming for more than a small grp.

I made sure I told Lee that sentiment the next day when she was working. I said that ""I would like to figure out how to DM before inviting other people but eventually I would be more than hapoy to expand the group."" She gave me the nastiest look and was like ""alright."" 

We have our first session coming up but no one really wants to play with her and I would like to make a nice fun lighthearted environment for everyone. Would I be an asshole to uninvite/ exclude her for the good of the group?

49,1fr7tfz,AITA for reducing my cleaning lady's pay? ,"

I live on my own in a 3 level house.  For the last five years, I have used the same cleaning lady on the same schedule.  She followed me from my condo to my house when I moved two years ago.  She doubled the price she charged for cleaning a house vs condo, which of course makes perfect sense.  She is good and reliable, and I value her services.  I also know that I am one of her best clients.  I hardly ever make a mess and the house is pretty easy to clean once every two weeks at $200 a pop, very regular.  I think the rate is reasonable.  

However, I have recently been gifted a top of the line robot vacuum.  I had a robot vacuum 10 years ago when they just came out and wasn't impressed.  I never bothered with it afterwards.  Well, the new robot was amazing.  It vacuums, it mops, it auto washes and dries itself, it auto empties and it can clean under beds and furniture, something the cleaning lady cannot do.  In fact, I like it so much that I went and bought two more identical robots for each one of my floors.  So now I have an app on my phone that controls a fleet of those gleaming cleaning beasts that are worth 3K.  I run the bots almost everyday just for fun and you can imagine that my floors are pretty clean.  The cleaning lady still vacuum and mop my floor when she is here for her biweekly cleaning, and that takes up a really good chunk of her time.  I do feel that her cleaning the floor is a bit wasted at this point.  Don't get me wrong, I still need her for other stuff, like wipe down the counters, cleaning the bathroom, change the linens, etc. and it would be nice to have the floors hand cleaned once in a while, but I really feel her cleaning the already super clean floors on a regular basis is kinda pointless.  I was thinking of telling her to ignore the floors going forward except for maybe once every couple of month, but then I will be paying her the same for doing less work which doesn't seem right to me either.  

I wonder if I would be the asshole if I approached her about reducing the cleaning frequency (to once a month, perhaps) or just asked pay her less for doing less for each cleaning.  I do feel somewhat bad though, I am obviously a whole lot better off than the cleaning lady, but I also think I am kind of wasting my money here if I don't speak up.  I like her, but she is not impossible to replace.  If she doesn't accept the reduction proposal, I could easily find someone else to clean everything except the floor at a lower rate but that someone may not be as satisfactory in other ways.

I'm a 22-year-old female who two months ago, was starting to make positive changes in my life and financials through budgeting. My best friend, Pen (21), and I have been best friends for nine years. We've supported each other through our darkest times.

About two months ago, my car broke down again. It was a Friday morning, and I had a ten-hour shift ahead. Before dropping my car off at the shop, I called Pen to ask if I could stay at her and her dad's place for the night. I needed somewhere to crash after my late shift and before my early shift the next day. Pen agreed, saying she had no plans.

I‚Äôm a situational extrovert and usually have high energy after work due to the adrenaline rush of my fast-food job. So, when Pen and her childhood friend, Cindy, picked me up after my shift, I was initially excited to go out. Cindy, however, was my high school bully. Though I‚Äôve moved past that, I wasn‚Äôt eager to spend time with her.

As we drove around, Cindy started smoking weed and driving recklessly. Pen knows I hate being driven around, especially by someone under the influence, so I was already uncomfortable. It was around 11:30 PM, and they were discussing plans to go out drinking. I only had $25 and was under the impression I wouldn‚Äôt need to spend much, especially since I had been cutting back on alcohol for health reasons.

By midnight, I was exhausted and hungry. I ended up spending all my money (25) on food for everyone, with the promise that I‚Äôd be paid back the next day. That $25 was suppose to last me 4 days and in this economy it's hard.  I felt unwelcome the whole night. Cindy and Pen kept saying that I could leave if I was too tired or not wanting to be out but I had nowhere to go. The next morning, Pen called me a buzzkill and dropped me off at my workplace. I was hurt and ended up sobbing because of everything.

A week later, I confronted Pen, explaining that I didn‚Äôt want to be seen as a buzzkill and that I didn‚Äôt appreciate being made to feel uncomfortable or pressured into spending money I didn‚Äôt have. She got angry, saying I should have spoken up to Cindy directly, even though both of them had been dismissive and rude all night. I also never received my 25 back.

It took me a week to approach Pen because I was genuinely hurt and wanted to make sure I wasn‚Äôt speaking out of anger. I admit I initially wanted to go out, but by 11 PM, I changed my mind. They insisted we go out anyway or find somewhere else to hang out.

54,1fr7huc,AITA for refusing to lend my friend more money after she hasn't paid me back?,"I am (f27), and I have one close friend, Sarah (f28), whom I have been friends with since high school. We used to support each other always and never differentiated between what we had or what we didn't, be it our emotional support or materialistic goods. About six months ago, Sarah was under some financial stress, following some rather unexpected medical bills; she asked if she could borrow $400 to help cover rent. I didn't think twice and lent her the money, and she promised to pay me back once things stabilized.  
  
About a few months later, Sarah landed a better-paying job, and I decided to let her have it for some time before bringing out that loan. But she hasn't even brought up the subject of how to begin repaying me, and I haven't offered because I was afraid of the rebuff. Last week, though, Sarah asked if she could borrow another $200 to use with her car repairs. That really surprised me because she hadn't repaid the first loan yet.  
  
I mentioned that $400 she still owes me, and Sarah defended herself saying, ""I have had various expenses these past few months and haven't been able to save at all."" I said I understand where she's coming from but it's not easy lending her money again until she pays back the money she owes. It got hot in there with Sarah because she feels that I am money-minded and know she is still suffering. She promises to pay me back someday, but she is starting to really take advantage of me.  
  
Some of our friends feel I am being very reasonable and others say, ""What's the big deal? She has had a bad year; she just needs some help."" Then again, I might be too strict or maybe asking her to pay back the first loan would not be too much to ask before she starts with me again.

We had a long discussion about it and she once again, fully agreed to the 10pm on school nights limit. However, last night I watched him sneak in at around 11 and he did not leave until early this morning.

","I've been friends with Skylar (26M) for years. Our friendship has been slightly rocky, he hasn't always been the best friend to me, but I haven't been perfect either. We live in the same city now with several other people in the same friend group so we've tried to rebuild our friendship.

Skylar has been historically stubborn and refuses to take advice. Recently he's been diagnosed with bipolar disorder after a bad manic episode. Since then, he has made a series of bad decisions.

1. He took paid time off work for medical reasons, despite our friend who did the same thing telling him that he won't get that money for over a month and he can't afford it
2. He decided to go back to school and start working part time at his job, meaning he will be working 4 days a week and go to school the other 3 days with no breaks.
3. He had stopped paying earlier school loans because he believed if he enrolled in school it would be defered. It's a private loan, it wasn't, and he had to settle and now owes thousands of dollars he doesn't have by the end of october.
4. He tried to go back to school so late there's no space in his major and he has to take really hard classes to qualify for financial aid.
5. He did so little research on his school financial aid he thought he'd be getting thousands more than he really would, what he's getting will cover less than half the loan he owes.
6. He can't make rent because of the PTO.
7. His roommate is trying to be nice but he isn't cleaning, and he has three cats. His house is a mess and covered in litter, he has broken glass in his room.

We spent hours and hours warning him against each step of this (except for the loan, we didn't know he wasn't paying it). He kept insisting he was ready for no reasons other than vibes and ""feeling refreshed"" and ignored our other bipolar friend who said this was a symptom. We begged him to wait just a quarter to be more ready. We know he's doing bad but at this point we are sick of trying to dig him out of this hole. My friend/roommate has given him hundreds of dollars for rent over the years. I went over to his house to clean it for him because I don't want his roommate to move out and leave him in a bad spot.

He knows we are mad at him for ignoring our advice and now feeling sorry for himself due to the situation he created, so he has started to emphasize his bad mental state and beg for sympathy. He came over because I was feeling bad and wanted to casually hang out, and he threw another pity party for himself. I said to him ""honestly man, it's a really bad look that you made all the decisions we warned you against and now you want us to pat your ass now that you have to deal with the consequences.""

59,1fr6x01,AITA for telling my friend to shut up/ F off?,"I (18F) turned 18 a few weeks ago and for my birthday my parents bought me a sapphire jewelry set consisting of matching earrings, a necklace, and ring. 

Due to my lunch schedule, I eat lunch with a lot of underclassmen, so I started sitting with an old friend/ acquaintance (17F) and some of her friends. I like her but I admit she has flaws where she talks bad about people she calls her ‚Äúsisters.‚Äù (Close friends of hers) random emotional outbursts (randomly crying/ explosive anger) and cheating on boyfriends. 

So for the past few weeks I‚Äôve been wearing my jewelry set every day and I‚Äôm really happy to have this set, so I like to hold the ring up to the sun and admire it. 

I was doing this today at lunch and my friend made a comment how it was funny I kept bragging about my jewelry. I said I wasn‚Äôt bragging because I hadn‚Äôt said anything, and was just sitting.

I felt a little offended because I was minding my business, and I said I didn‚Äôt care about the size of the ring, I got what I wanted and I was grateful for it.

63,1fr5sdv,AITA for refusing to contact my estranged father?,"I (36F) have a long and complicated history with my father. To give some context, I wasn‚Äôt even his first family. Before he married my mom, he was married to someone else and had two kids with her. He left them, married my mom, and had my sister and me. Then, when I was 6, he divorced my mom, too.

After the divorce, he stayed in my life, but I was more of a prop for him to show off that he was a ""family man"" rather than actually being a parent. It felt like he used my sister and me to attract his next wife, whom he married not long after. That woman was incredibly mentally abusive towards me. It got so bad that I stopped living with my dad part-time and only saw him occasionally.

That marriage ended when I turned 18, and since then, my father has gotten married three more times. I eventually cut him off entirely because he‚Äôs always been a self-centered, manipulative person who made my life miserable. I needed to distance myself for my own mental well-being.

Recently, I was contacted by his current wife. Apparently, my father left her and her 5-year-old son (I'm not related to the child) to move to Thailand, where he‚Äôs now living with another person. His wife has been pleading with me to get in touch with him and convince him to come back. She‚Äôs clearly struggling and in a rough spot.

I‚Äôve already explained to her that this is what he does‚Äîhe leaves families behind and moves on. I told her he‚Äôs not worth her time, but there‚Äôs an added complication. He brought her and her son over from China, and I think her citizenship might be tied to their marriage. This makes me feel even worse because she‚Äôs in a vulnerable position and likely terrified about what could happen to her and her son.

While I do sympathize with her situation, I just can‚Äôt bring myself to get involved. My father has left multiple families in his wake, and I don‚Äôt see how contacting him would make any difference. He‚Äôs shown time and time again that he‚Äôs not capable of being a decent person.

Warning for Minor spelling errors 

I M20 live with my mom and step dad (M and SD) both 48 and my sister F16. I want to make it Verry clear other than school and my phone They pay the bills Sience I'm in collage.  

At 7:30pm on Monday My dad asked me to move some rocks by my window because he replaced the window screens and they cost a lot of money 580 USD to be exact because, 5 years ago our previous cat broke the screen trying to get into my room. Our current cat wouldn't do that and doesn't even use that window witch I told him. He said he didn't care, I ask if I was going to get paid I was told no I asked If I could get a ride to the store as I cannot drive and I was told ""I'm too tired"". I told him it would take me a few days as it was already dark and I had work/class the next few days so it wouldn't be done until Friday the earliest.

Now for the next three days at the Low end I'm out of the house for 13 hours but it can get up to 17 hours When I get home witch is normally walking and bussing I have to do laundry, clean dishes, my own room cook my own food

He does Nothing in the House expect feed his stupid dogs and pay bills he doesn't even cook for himself his Mother, My mom or My Sister cook for him. 

So now it's Friday and I start doing this stupid task. And there are a Lot of spiders. I am very allergic to spiders If I get bitten even by a non venomous spider my boady will start swelling Last time this happened I needed an emergency allergy shot because my entire arm was swollen. And THANKS TO HIM CALLING PEOPLE SLURS he lost his old job for ""gross misconduct"" and so we don't have insurance anymore. 

When he got home he was pissed but I needed to leave to get my check and get some groceries. When I got home I made my dinner and tried to talk to him half way through he stopped me saying ""Are you 80% done with this conversation too?' I strommed off and he started screaming about how he ""Gave me time"" I saw Red and Started to scream that he gave me the ""Three days I'm not home"" but he wouldn't listen and started to make that mocking voice. So I said fuck it and just started to pick up where I left off

when I was finished and outside I don't know why I just broke down and stared to sob on my hands and knees outside. I think I was just looking for anyone to ask me if I was ok. And you know what I hear He was Mocking me and laughing. I just went into my room and started screaming and not saying words screaming just screaming and laughing until I couldn't. I don't know why I did it but it just felt right. I did some others things that are common in ""Destructive self soothing"" that autistic children do it's something I only did it because That Fucker telling me to do it and I didn't even get so much as a thank you.

68,1fr512o,AITA for asking for a reimbursement?,"Sorry if my redaction is not the best; my main language is not English and I‚Äôm kinda mad at the time lol.

Hello everyone! Long story short, I (28F) started a postgraduate diploma last year at a well-known university in my town. 

From the very beginning, things were a mess. Before the program even started, I asked for a reimbursement because of how disorganized everything was. However, the coordinator convinced me that things would improve and that the issues I encountered were isolated incidents.

Fast forward to the end, we were required to submit a final project to receive our certificate.

It‚Äôs now been 150 days since I submitted my work, and I haven‚Äôt received any feedback. I‚Äôm frustrated! She ignored my emails, so I had to message her directly. When she finally responded, she rudely claimed that ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù had given me feedback two months ago, which is completely false. I told her that directly.

At this point, I‚Äôm beyond frustrated. I‚Äôve been patient and polite, even when she wasn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm desperate now. So, I just sent her a new email and CC‚Äôd the rector and provost. In my email, I stated that if I wasn‚Äôt going to receive any feedback, I‚Äôd like to know so I can request a reimbursement.

AITA for asking for a reimbursement and CC‚Äôing the rector and provost?

**Additional Info:**
- I visited her once before submitting my final project, but since I work in a remote area, visiting her office in person again is difficult for me.

Hello everyone! Long story short, I (28F) started a postgraduate diploma last year at a well-known university in my town. 

From the very beginning, things were a mess. Before the program even started, I asked for a reimbursement because of how disorganized everything was. However, the coordinator convinced me that things would improve and that the issues I encountered were isolated incidents.

Fast forward to the end, we were required to submit a final project to receive our certificate.

It‚Äôs now been 150 days since I submitted my work, and I haven‚Äôt received any feedback. I‚Äôm frustrated! She ignored my emails, so I had to message her directly. When she finally responded, she rudely claimed that ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù had given me feedback two months ago, which is completely false. I told her that directly.

At this point, I‚Äôm beyond frustrated. I‚Äôve been patient and polite, even when she wasn‚Äôt, but I‚Äôm desperate now. So, I just sent her a new email and CC‚Äôd the rector and provost. In my email, I stated that if I wasn‚Äôt going to receive any feedback, I‚Äôd like to know so I can request a reimbursement.

AITA for asking for a reimbursement and CC‚Äôing the rector and provost?

**Additional Info:**
- I visited her once before submitting my final project, but since I work in a remote area, visiting her office in person again is difficult for me.
- I called the rector once and explained the situation. He said he would speak to her, but it‚Äôs been almost four weeks with no response.

69,1fr503s,AITA for moving out of my college dorm room? ,"Hi, I'm currently a sophomore at college and I've been living with my roommates for less than three weeks.. I have been stressed with the question, AITA for moving out / wanting to move out?

Note: I already have put in the room change request.

A little backstory, I've been living with my freshman roommate since the (my second, her first) semester of college. We had some conflicts that we ended up discussing; her being loud, being a drunk-liability, and failing her classes (which isn't my responsibility, but as a friend, I did feel a little bit of responsibility since I care for her) and she has shown some effort in change since then and now. My second roommate is my best friend of 2-3 years, I love them to death and it's one of the biggest reasons why I feel like an asshole for moving out; I feel like I'm being selfish for leaving them behind.

It's been three weeks since the fall semester of college began and I have had non-stop discomfort. I've been going through a lot of medical and mental problems, so I've been simply a nervous wreck. My roommates, however, have not been as accommodating to my stress as I would have hoped. I have spoken to them before about how scared I am for my health and how I simply need them to support me but they have been drinking, playing video games, and raging; not picking up trash which I have had to do the chores they had stated that they would do. It would pile up so badly and now we have fruit flies in the room... This, combined with my school work and my well-being has NOT mixed well. Now, before you ask, 'Oh well just talk to them', I have tried. I try to put in the effort but I simply do not get what I put in returned to me. They are all either too busy or simply disregard my texts when I wish to talk to them to schedule a time to discuss our dynamic in our dorm. I already spoke with my other roommate, who is an RA, about moving out and she has been more than kind to accommodating me. 

My good friend on the other side of the dorm hall has offered to let me in the vacant spot of her room, which I have taken. I am planning on sending out a text to the suite group chat tonight to tell them that my accommodations do not mix with their life style; which isn't a bad thing. Sometimes, people aren't meant to live with each other. Which is okay.

My partners' sister (25f; let's call her Jane) lives in a different house (still owned by the parents) but comes to the main house everyday. She comes here at around 7am before her current partner goes to work, and leaves at around 6-7pm after her partner comes home. 

Now the part where I may be the AH is that I don't do ALL the dishes. I will wash some, but I don't wash the plates used by Jane and her family, which is kind of a lot considering she has 3 kids. I only wash what my in-laws and my family used.

The dishes in the sink piled up when the parents were gone for the past few days, and i had to leave for a few hours each day to process some documents. I still come home during lunch to feed my kids and I immediately wash the dishes we used. Jane comes, eats then leaves the dishes ON THE TABLE. She doesn't even bother to put them in the sink sometimes.

The parents came home and started to berate me after seeing the sink. I feel guilty because maybe I could've done more, I guess? And I really don't like being a burden to them. But I feel like it's not my fault the dishes piled up.

75,1fr3y56,AITA for asking my sister to put money on the laundry card?,"I (23F) was long overdue to do my laundry. I had a lot of homework this week, and i work late, so i wasn't able to do it earlier in the week. Our apartment complex doesn't have an in-unit washer and dryer; we have to put money on a card in order to use the communal washers & dryers.

I went down to the basement to do my laundry, and was already annoyed that most of the washers were being used. Thankfully, some of the machines were done and someone quickly came by to pick up their stuff. I put my laundry in one of the dryers, and went to put the card in, only to find out it didn't have any money on it, because I'd grabbed the wrong one (don't ask why we have two). I go back to the apartment, grab the correct card, go back downstairs, only for *that* card to also have no money on it despite mom saying there was (not her fault, she misremembered). Knowing how many people will want to use these machines on a friday night, i went back upstairs to ask my sister (18f) to do me a solid and go to the other building to refill it.

But if course, when I go back upstairs to ask my sister (who, mind you, does not work and isn't in school, literally been doing nothing all day), for this one, small favor, she hits me with the exact same response she *always* gives whenever I ask her to do something: ""Why can't you do it?""

Even more annoyed now, I explain that it's really busy down there and I want to guard my territory. She says, and I quote: ""I highly doubt someone is going to steal a machine while you're gone.""

Extremely frustrated at this point, I say ""Can you please just fucking do it?"" To which she reluctantly agrees.

And just *guess* what happened when I went back downstairs. Yep - somebody else started using one of the washers! Thankfully, there was one washer free that I hadn't already put my clothes in, so i staked my claim on that one while i waited for her to get back.

When she got back with the card, I told her that somebody took one of the washers while i'd been gone trying to argue with her to do me this small favor. Now admittedly, I did flip her off in anger, which was wrong of me. 

Once I got back from putting my laundry in, I yelled at her that i was sick of her ""wHy DoN't YoU dO iT"" attitude, and then when i ask her for small favors, it's for a reason.

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-28,"AITA for planning something for a friends birthday that‚Äôs in 3 months with her cousin who i still haven‚Äôt seen for her birthday?  Okay so I (18F) want to plan something for my friend (18F) and her bdays in 3 months but i wanna do something big for her bday. I impulsively made a group chat with her cousins (20F and 17F) who i grew up with and have been friends with for a while. 

For backstory, my bday was a couple of months ago and they were at my bday party and helped set up everything and got me nice gifts.  So the cousin who is 20, let‚Äôs call her Lianne, her bday was 2 weeks ago and i couldn‚Äôt see her last week bc i had exams all week and we planned something on this past monday but i couldn‚Äôt go because i was really really sick and then we planned something yesterday but couldn‚Äôt go bc it didn‚Äôt work out for all of us. 

Back to the main point, i made a group chat and planned something for my friends (18F) birthday that‚Äôs in 3 months.

I saw that my brother‚Äôs favorite music artist is preforming in our city and I wanted to surprise him with tickets, coincidentally, it‚Äôs on my wife‚Äôs birthday. My brother has never seen this artist perform in fact this would be his first concert ever. I told my wife the plan I have to hang out with my brother that day, and she got upset. Even though we agreed to celebrate her birthday the day before the concert ( because all her friends can only make it on that day) she‚Äôs still upset that I won‚Äôt be with her on her actual birth date. 

I understand the importance of being with her on her birthday, but I told her since we are celebrating the day before that it should be ok for me to go to the concert. The artist that is performing is a pretty big artist and has never been to our city before so it‚Äôs an opportunity that I don‚Äôt want to pass up on. I also told her that we can spend most of the day together because the concert starts at 7pm, so until then we can do whatever she would like, I can even plan a super fun day for her. 

I don‚Äôt think me going is that big of a deal, I feel like the most important thing is that we celebrate and she gets a party with all her friends. She thinks it‚Äôs a big deal and doesn‚Äôt want to go to the concert at all. I have plenty of nice gifts that I plan to give to her. But I don‚Äôt want to but my brother another gift because I know he‚Äôll love the one I have planned. AITA?

Here‚Äôs the context:

We both moved into a 2 bedroom, 2.5 bathroom condo about 5ish years ago. The bedrooms are dual masters, same size, amenities, and layouts except flipped. 

The first floor is a split level. The first level has the entryway and a small family room (?) that is used as an office space. The second level contains the kitchen and living room. 

For the first three years my roommate contributed more to rent so he could have sole use of the office. He furnished  the room with a desk, bookcase, filing cabinets, etc. and paid for 100% for it all.

Sometime during year 3, in the midst of COVID, he offered to let me use the space as I was now fully remote while he opted to work out of his office at work for the majority of the week. He continued to pay more in rent, despite me now using the space and furniture. 

Year 4, we changed the rent contribution to be equal. He had unfortunately lost his job, and I continued to work from the home office because I was and still am 100% remote. 

Cut to now, he unfortunately hasn‚Äôt been able to maintain a stable job and as a result, not contributed his portion of rent in ~1.5 (?) years. I have continued to work from the home office and have essentially taken over the space for my sole use.

I am not against washing up now and then and generally helping out but what i am against is being forced to do it because of this house rule that doesn't seem to be evenly applied

A house rule ever since i can remember it being a factor ( teenager) was "" if you don't work or cook you wash up after dinner"" in summary, but now both parents are retired (60s) and i (late 20s) just got a job and my brother ( early 20s) works as well so by the house rule it is up to my mother to clean/wash up, as my dad cooks for the 4 of us.

However she is now actively thinking of reasons why i should keep doing it because i think she doesn't like doing it, i am adamant i shouldn't do it because my brother who got a job before me (6 months )doesn't and still isn't expected to it so for me to get a job and then immediately expect to keep washing up is unfair given how they said and do try to treat us the same and given the scenario are very close with the difference of work time, he is more 9-5 where as i am more shift, ie could be 10-7 one day then 1-10pm the next day for example.

My dad is saying i should just  help her but i explain the house rule which he dismiss of never being a rule  and i should do it to keep her happy but disregards my feeling/ frustrations about the sudden change of a house rule

I have explain why to my mother but because she is very easily to explode in anger at me, as have Asperger's/autism so i likely say things that annoyed her in conversations just ends in her shouting at me so not a lot of productive communication can happen.

I am not against washing up on weekends/ days off but because of my brother who has set the precedent i don't think it is right that i am following the house rules that everyone else did but now because it is solely effecting my mother it should change for her sole benefit when it has been the case for a decade +

While i am willing to discuss it with my parents but because it would effect my brother as well i cant see a fair new rule that wont impact me negatively the worse given how any new rule wouldn't address the 6month of it i have done and my brother hasn't plus all the extra benefits he got as well.

(everything below is extra info l that might help with judgement but not relevant to the scenario)

I cant simply move out given how where i live currently is the best for my job for travel and i shouldn't live alone due to some mental health things

Afaik my mother is not diagnosed with any mental condition that would explain her explosive temper but does act autisticially but refuses to get tested because "" i am old so i doesnt matter"" and we just have to deal with it where as i feel like i have to hide/supress my autism to keep things normal

My brother seems to get more favor in similar but not 1:1 cases like i the past i could only have my friends around for 3 hours with notice but my brother can ring home on the day and have his friends over with no time limit.

She is not from my country and after 10 months has run out of money and has to move home. The possibility of her moving home has been on the table since she lost her job but she would not commit to telling me when this would happen. In my country tenants must serve 2 months notice when they are leaving a rental and I think I‚Äôve been pretty nice by not demanding she serve this notice and pay the rent for this time. I have organised for my partner to move in but we have been waiting on the green light from her for this the entire 10 months which is stressful as we don‚Äôt know when exactly this can happen making it impossible to plan and organise for. 

To add to this, I‚Äôm sitting professional exams to become a lawyer and have been preparing for them for months. She is well aware of this and I have asked her regularly to please consider the stress I‚Äôm under when she‚Äôs considering her timeline for moving home. Well of course when my exams are next week she tells me that she will be moving out the week of my exams. She has a tonne of furniture to sell and 5 years of a life in this country to pack up so the place isn‚Äôt exactly going to be an ideal place to study and sit these extremely difficult exams. 

Now having lived with her this long I know her habits and how messy she is and honestly how incredibly lazy she is.

I also know she won‚Äôt thoroughly clean her room the way it would be expected to be handed over if she was giving the place back to the landlord or to new tenants she doesn‚Äôt know. 

So I‚Äôm left wondering WIBTA if I demand she pays for a cleaner to come in and do the work or if she doesn‚Äôt, the bills are currently in her name and linked to her account so if she refuses to have it cleaned I‚Äôm thinking I just refuse to pay my share of the bills for the final bill as that‚Äôs around the cost of a cleaner coming in.

I also know she won‚Äôt thoroughly clean her room the way it would be expected to be handed over if she was giving the place back to the landlord or to new tenants she doesn‚Äôt know. 

So I‚Äôm left wondering WIBTA if I demand she pays for a cleaner to come in and do the work or if she doesn‚Äôt, the bills are currently in her name and linked to her account so if she refuses to have it cleaned I‚Äôm thinking I just refuse to pay my share of the bills for the final bill as that‚Äôs around the cost of a cleaner coming in.

88,1frra6r,AITAH for giving gluten to my gluten free mother without telling her,"So my mother and I don't have a great relationship. I recently moved to a new place in a really nice area because I just got a really nice new  job. Suddenly my mom really wants to come and visit and see me. I do my best to make up excuses, but she pushes so hard that eventually I cave.
  
  
I've been cooking a lot since I got here because I have a nice big kitchen all to myself. Recently I started making latiao. I love it.
  
  
Well, my mom and dad got here yesterday afternoon/evening and settle in and we start talking about dinner. As usual, mom has to pick after looking at online menus for a couple hours to make sure they fit with her dietary requirements. She ends up picking a vegan restaurant that's accross town, but she's just *so tired* from the drive up she can't fathom getting back in the car. So dad and I agree to go pick it up while she rests.

Driving accross my new city is a long process (which I told her ahead of time), and it's a little over an hour later when we get home with the vegan/gluten free food she wanted (she's not vegan, but she is adamantly gluten free and has been for a few years now). We get inside and as I am opening the food in the kitchen I notice the pyrex snapware container of Latiao that was in my fridge is now empty in my sink. She even dumped out the sauce that I'd been soaking them in.
  
  
I asked her if she'd eaten something out of my fridge while we were gone and she said that yes she had eaten some chicken because she was getting light headed from hunger, but it was terrible and she was so ready for some 'real food'. Now this is where I might have been the asshole; instead of telling her what she had actually eaten, I just rolled my eyes and dished up the food for everyone and we ate. She continued to remark about how bad and oily the ""chicken"" was all night. 
  
  
I finally snapped when she brought it up again first thing this morning when I was picking them up from their hotel. My mom made a joke about not wanting me to cook them breakfast because she didn't want more oily chicken or something to that effect.
  
  
I finally said ""mom, that was homemade latiao, and I don't understand why you ate ALL of it if you hated it so much."" She asked me what latiao is and I explained that it's essentially 100% gluten. I watched as her face dropped, and sure enough within 30 minutes her stomach was ""killing her"" and she was having difficulty breathing and needed to go to the emergency room.
  
  
The whole time we were there she went on and on to the nurses and doctors about how I'd fed her gluten and not told her until it was too late for her to take her medicine and crying because now the whole trip was ruined. Mind you, this is the hospital WHERE I WORK. My dad essentially told me to go home and think about my actions and give my mother some space, and now I'm just sitting here alone in my cool new place feeling like a dick and super anxious about what work is going to be like next week.

90,1frq5w5,AITA - Wet feet v. Squirrel life,"AITA? 
I am a new mom and have a new perspective on life now that I‚Äôve created life. My husband is also a new dad. 
While preparing lunch, we heard a horrific screeching in our back yard, as our dog caught a squirrel. I immediately screamed for my husband to go help. My husband refused. Instead, my elderly mother went outside to try to get the dog to release the squirrel, that was still screeching. 

I was holding the other dogs back, in the middle of a work assignment otherwise I would have run out myself. As I started crying asking my husband why he wouldn‚Äôt help, he said he didn‚Äôt have shoes on and didn‚Äôt want to get his feet wet. I told him to just take his socks off and that his feet are washable. I understand it‚Äôs just a squirrel but it was being tortured and could have also injured our dog, or transmitted a disease. 

I also know if I had gone out there, my husband would have been mad because he does not like when I put myself in ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù situations. 

He ended up going to help my mom and they got the dogs away from the squirrel. The squirrel was alert but having trouble moving so we took it to a wildlife vet. 

I was still upset with my husband after the ‚Äúrescue‚Äù because he chose to protect his feet over saving a life. I will add that we have been together for 11 years, I am a vegetarian, and very nature loving. He knows I am over caring about anything and everything. Again, I get how this is just a squirrel to him, but to me it was someone suffering and he did not do everything he could to help.

I haven't responded because I have no idea what to say. Any help over advice on what I should say is wanted!",4.0,1.0356732606887817,1,0
94,1frphk3,AITA for not letting my kids stay with their grandparents as their uncle caused them to have nightmares due to scary stories?,"I (M40) and my partner (M42) have 2 children both under 4 years old. As a family we are close to both sides of the family. It's not unusual for us to leave the kids with their grandparents so we can get nights for ourselves be it work or social reasons. However after a recent visit to my in-laws both of the kids started having nightmares about scary things that were coming to get them etc. After a few nights and conversations between me and my partner trying to work out if they'd watched anything scary or we'd watched anything that might trigger this we drew a blank. After talking to our eldest we managed to piece together that my brother in law, who is 29, had told them scary stories.

My brother in law lives with his parents and has done for the past few years since his last serious relationship broke down. He's always been amazing with the kids and they love him. I decided to call him and see what he had to say as I believe my child but also wanted to hear his side. Long story short he said he'd told them about scarecrows that will walk at night and kidnap children from their beds etc. For the record we live beside a field and yes there are scarecrows in it.

The conflict started as I asked him to tell the kids he was making up these stories and even suggested we go a walk into the field and show that the scarecrows are just straw people wearing human clothes. He laughed and said there was no way he's going to do that as kids being scared is a part of growing up. I obviously said he'd upset the kids and I expected him to put it right. Well he again refused and we ended the call.

When I ended the call I told my partner there was no way the kids were going to stay at his parents until this was resolved. My partner was, and rightly so, pissed at me and said I shouldn't take it out on them that his brother is a tool. So I told him to call his brother to fix it and he got the same result. As a result of this his parents were told the situation and explained due to my BiL not willing to tell the kids he was making stuff up to scare them the kids wouldn't be left on their own at their house if he was there.

My FiL is amazing and has told him to basically tell the truth as he wants to see the kids but my mother in law claims I'm overreacting and my BiL will tell the truth in time but doesn't like being told to do things.

My kids don't want to see their uncle just now (actually the more time passes the less they want to see him) and don't want to go their grandparents as he is there. This has been explained to my mother in law who vehemently defends their uncle. My in laws visit my house to see the kids and we still go out and about so it's not like the kids are being withheld from their grandparents. I just won't budge until he apologises or tells the kids the truth but really don't want him being left with the kids now.

I am going to have another conversation with her about this issue and try to be less confrontational. For those accusing me of making this up, I wish I was. I can‚Äôt say I blame you though, if I read a post this insane I would probably think the same thing. Unfortunately, This is something very real that I am dealing with and I was simply looking for some guidance.


To give some backstory, I (19F, white) have been living with my college roommate (19F, Hispanic) for the past two years. Last year, our dorm building only had community bathrooms, so I was completely unaware of her bathroom habits as we did not share this space.

Fast forward to the current school year, we now have our own apartment where the two of us share a bathroom. After about a week and a half of living together, I started to notice a foul odor coming from our bathroom. I spent hours scrubbing the shower, sink, toilet, floor, and counters, but the smell did not go away. I convinced myself that it must have been the sink releasing some trapped gas from the pipes or something. I submitted a work order to have the drain looked at and called it a day. 

Another week goes by and the smell is almost unbearable. Maintenance still hasn‚Äôt come, so I open the cupboard underneath the sink to try and have a look for myself. When I open the door, my nose is violated by an odor one can only describe as a porta-potty that has been sitting in full sun on the hottest day in July. I now realize where the stench is coming from as my eyes fall onto the trash can underneath the sink that is completely overflown with brown and yellow stained toilet paper. I walk directly over to my roommate‚Äôs bedroom and confront her about this. 

I ask why she has been throwing her used toilet paper into our trash can rather than flushing it down the toilet. She tells me that it is ‚ÄúMexican culture‚Äù and I wouldn‚Äôt understand. I have never heard of this in my life so I continue to question her about it. She tells me that everyone in Mexico throws their used toilet paper in the trash because the septic systems there aren‚Äôt designed to withstand toilet paper being flushed down them. 

I believe myself to be a very understanding person but this is just completely bizarre to me because my roommate has lived in the USA her entire life and has never even been to Mexico. I asked her if she wouldn‚Äôt mind flushing her toilet paper in our apartment due to the horrific stench that had built up over the first few weeks.

It was in beautiful condition considering it was a used bag but the buyer claimed there were ""markings"" on the bag, that it didn't look ""Like New"" as I had marketed it & saying he either wanted a partial refund or that he'll send it back for a full refund. 

I do agree I shouldn't have marketed it Like New but it really was in excellent condition, I assumed the markings he was talking abt were some slight creases that were evident on the bag since it was a very soft leather.  Looking back, I do think my messages came off as unprofessional and rude but I told him that any used bag he gets is gonna have some kind of evidence of being used & that if he wanted a bag that looks new he should just buy a brand new bag. Then I agreed that he should send the bag back if he was unhappy w it & I would give him the full refund.

He didn't contact me again until a month later saying he had proof the bag was fake & that he would report me if I didn't give him a refund. I apologized for the bag being fake bc I genuinely didn't know & told him again that I'd be fine giving the full refund as long as he sends pictures of the item in the condition he received it & proof he was sending it back. I ended up giving him the refund that day bc I felt bad abt all the hassle & just wanted the whole thing to be over with. Plus I trusted he would actually send the bag back since he was so unhappy with it. & He assured me he was working on getting a label and that ""there'd be no issues""

Except he never sent it back & blocked my account. I've gotten in contact w him recently through a second account and asked why he hasn't and he's basically demanding that I pay for the return bc I'm the one who tried to scam him. I don't think that's fair since I've alr done my part with giving him the full refund, before he ever sent proof of anything against my better judgement bc I felt bad & it's not like I was intentionally trying to scam him or anyone.

I've alr contacted Depop support to get it sorted so I'm not worried about that but I'm wondering if morally I even have a right to feel jolted by this or if it's just what I deserve for the attitude I had.

Would love to hear others perspectives on this bc I'm afraid if I talk to my friends it'll just become an echo chamber and they'll just validate my anger.

I planned to come see them, then they cancelled the day before. We rescheduled, but then I had to cancel for work. They recently messaged me that they were in my city for an event (think con/festival) and they 3 hours to kill and would love to see me. 


So I took the train 35 min to see him, and I find him waiting in line for something for this event with his friends. I asked if he invited me just to stand in line IN THE RAIN with him and his friends, and he stammered ‚ÄúI‚Äôm probably going to grab food also, you can come for that if you want‚Äù 


I said nope, I‚Äôm going home, and I would not have come if I knew you were inviting me to stand in line in the rain for an event I don‚Äôt even have an interest in or tickets to. 


He says he just wanted to see me and spend time  with me. AITA?

102,1frmllb,AITA for not forcing my daughter to be friends with a girl in her class?,"I'm looking for some other perspectivs on this situation involving my daughter and her friend, whom I'll call Emily. They have been friends since daycare, and I know Emily's mom well. Emily is a quiet girl who seems to be high-functioning. While she‚Äôs not in a special education class, her communication style is quite selective; she often prefers parallel play, and their interactions have mostly consisted of them being together but engaging in different activities but they do watch movies sometimes and converse.

Recently, my daughter expressed frustration with Emily, feeling that she is selfish. An incident occurred where my daughter asked to use a ruler, and Emily said no. My daughter was scolded by the teacher, which upset her further. She shared that she often helps Emily and stands up for her when others say negative things, yet during disagreements, Emily tends to remain silent. After this, my daughter announced that she no longer wanted to be friends with Emily.

I understood her feelings and suggested she talk to Emily about them, as Emily might not realize how my daughter felt. However, the next day, my daughter came home in tears, reiterating that she didn‚Äôt want to be friends anymore and didn‚Äôt want to discuss it. I reached out to the class teacher, who noted that my daughter had been emotional (on the verge of tears) since lunch but was unsure what had happened.

After observing my daughter‚Äôs distress, my husband and I decided not to force her to maintain a friendship she didn‚Äôt want. We reassured her that she didn‚Äôt have to be friends with someone if it made her uncomfortable. I kept the teacher informed, and she arranged for my daughter to sit away from Emily.

Last week, Emily‚Äôs mom contacted me, expressing concern about her daughter feeling isolated and suggesting a playdate to address the issues between the girls. I respectfully declined, explaining that my daughter no longer felt comfortable being friends with Emily. Emily‚Äôs mom reacted strongly, accusing my daughter of bullying and isolating Emily. She insisted I should teach my daughter that not all friendships look the same. She explained that just because Emily isn't good at expressing herself doesn't mean she's emotionless she has noticed that her daughter has been anxious in school and this ordeal has caused her so much more meltdowns. 

AITA for making this decision? Should I have handled this differently.
Edit - they are 9 yr olds and I am absolutely sure there is no bullying involved. ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-28,"AITA for not forcing my daughter to be friends with a girl in her class?

During covid I introduced my friends to alcohol for the first time, and now every time they drink they remind me I was the one that made them ‚Äúlike this‚Äù. 

My gf does not like to drink or smoke, and me being the D1 athlete of the friend group, I never drank during High school except for our graduation. 2/9 of my friends like to smoke and drink and they get really annoying cause they use me as their Designated Driver and act stupidly in public. So most of the times when they hang out they end up drunk or high and I honestly do not like it. 

The problem is that on friday my friend (Mark) texted me 2 hours after a hard workout to meet at Henry‚Äôs house to surprise him cause he was flying from Kansas Community College and staying for the weekend. The plan was to meet up at 10pm. I fell asleep as soon as I touched my bed and forgot about the surprise. Later in the day my gf surprised me by bringing me snacks and staying over for a bit. We watched movies and fell asleep and with her and when I woke up it was 11:30pm. I soon realized I missed the surprise, and my friends sent videos of them at his house having a bit of drinks and eating. I felt terrible. 

This morning I texted the chat with a funny reel, which was about making any excuse to drink. I tagged the heaviest drinkers (Mark and Abel) in our group and they replied with ‚Äúat least I‚Äôm not on a leash‚Äù ‚ÄúYou dont even make time for us, I blame ur gf‚Äù ‚Äú Everyday I see your gf‚Äôs car outside your house‚Äù.
