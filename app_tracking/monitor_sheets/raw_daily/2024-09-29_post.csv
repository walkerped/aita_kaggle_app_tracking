0,1frz1il,"AITA for telling my mom there's ""something wrong with me""?","I'm closeted nonbinary (AFAB), and I often forget to do simple things that my mom asks me to do, getting distracted by stupid things or not reading a situation correctly and embarrassing/upsetting her. I always tried to explain that I didn't mean to, and even though I was sorry, and I would try harder in the future it really wasn't my intention to disrespect her. Of course, she never listens and seems to believe I'm lying to keep myself out of trouble. 

Several months ago I did some research on autism, but couldn't find anything really fit me, even though I strongly identified with certain things. I kinda forgot about it for a while, and this conversation occurred in the midst of that. Since I hadn't really figured it out, I went bare-bones when trying to explain to my mom why I didn't listen to her in our most recent fight. I simply told her ""there's something wrong with me""  
She told me she'd look into it.

Post-fight I've been re-researching autism, especially in not-cis-men. I've come to the conclusion that I am likely on the spectrum. Since I'm good at masking, subtly stim and am generally pretty social within my small friend group, I doubt that anyone would ever suspect that I'm autistic, even me (except maybe my extensive knowledge of the batfam would be a bit weird). However, I think my mom would believe that I'm simply using it as an excuse, wouldn't get me diagnosed, and do the barest research from studies linked to cis men with autism in order to ""prove me wrong."" 

My mom isn't very responsive to rationality, unfortunately, so the most effective way to help her understand what I'm feeling fully at any given moment is to make her relive my journey. Now that I've shared with her the most fundamental feeling of wrongness/otherness that led me to wonder if I was autistic, I can sort of guide(?) the way she'll find out and hopefully influence her perceptions.

My plan from here, even if I don't feel quite right about it, is to let her do some research on her own for a bit. She'll hopefully come to me with it eventually, and if she's started looking into autism then I'll listen, maybe say that I thought of that too and it seems to fit, and everything will be dandy. If not, I'll hear her out, then tell her that actually I've been doing some research and I've been wondering if I might have autism. Obviously since she knows very little about autism it'll take a bit to clear away the misconceptions surrounding it, but I don't see how it would have gone better by just bringing it up right off the bat. 

Of course, in some horrible way I still feel like there \*is\* something wrong, but I know now that it's likely just my lovely autistic self, doing my thing. I feel a bad for making her think that I would ever think so horribly about myself (even if I honestly do) and worrying her. So, AITA for telling her there's something wrong with me? More importantly, AITA for taking my sort-of-slip-up and using it to sort of manipulate her?",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-09-29,"AITA for telling my mom there's ""something wrong with me""?
