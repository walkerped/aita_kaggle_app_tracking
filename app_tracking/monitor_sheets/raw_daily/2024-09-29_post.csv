0,1frz1il,"AITA for telling my mom there's ""something wrong with me""?","I'm closeted nonbinary (AFAB), and I often forget to do simple things that my mom asks me to do, getting distracted by stupid things or not reading a situation correctly and embarrassing/upsetting her. I always tried to explain that I didn't mean to, and even though I was sorry, and I would try harder in the future it really wasn't my intention to disrespect her. Of course, she never listens and seems to believe I'm lying to keep myself out of trouble. 

Several months ago I did some research on autism, but couldn't find anything really fit me, even though I strongly identified with certain things. I kinda forgot about it for a while, and this conversation occurred in the midst of that. Since I hadn't really figured it out, I went bare-bones when trying to explain to my mom why I didn't listen to her in our most recent fight. I simply told her ""there's something wrong with me""  
She told me she'd look into it.

Post-fight I've been re-researching autism, especially in not-cis-men. I've come to the conclusion that I am likely on the spectrum. Since I'm good at masking, subtly stim and am generally pretty social within my small friend group, I doubt that anyone would ever suspect that I'm autistic, even me (except maybe my extensive knowledge of the batfam would be a bit weird). However, I think my mom would believe that I'm simply using it as an excuse, wouldn't get me diagnosed, and do the barest research from studies linked to cis men with autism in order to ""prove me wrong."" 

My mom isn't very responsive to rationality, unfortunately, so the most effective way to help her understand what I'm feeling fully at any given moment is to make her relive my journey. Now that I've shared with her the most fundamental feeling of wrongness/otherness that led me to wonder if I was autistic, I can sort of guide(?) the way she'll find out and hopefully influence her perceptions.

My plan from here, even if I don't feel quite right about it, is to let her do some research on her own for a bit. She'll hopefully come to me with it eventually, and if she's started looking into autism then I'll listen, maybe say that I thought of that too and it seems to fit, and everything will be dandy. If not, I'll hear her out, then tell her that actually I've been doing some research and I've been wondering if I might have autism. Obviously since she knows very little about autism it'll take a bit to clear away the misconceptions surrounding it, but I don't see how it would have gone better by just bringing it up right off the bat. 

Of course, in some horrible way I still feel like there \*is\* something wrong, but I know now that it's likely just my lovely autistic self, doing my thing. I feel a bad for making her think that I would ever think so horribly about myself (even if I honestly do) and worrying her. So, AITA for telling her there's something wrong with me?

2,1fsc692,WIBTA for calling out my bestfriend for refusing to hang out after I broke up with my boyfriend?,"Yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend. Not going to get into detail but while I love him, I found we were incompatible in several ways and ultimately decided to break up with him. 

As I anticipated I am feeling sad and lost, we had been together for almost 3 years. Yesterday (Saturday) at night I asked my bff to hang out today in the evening/night. She told me that she had plans to meet her boyfriend but could change them if I needed to talk. I answered that I would appreciate seeing her but that we could also meet a different day (tomorrow Monday) if it worked better for her. 

Her answer was that she had mentioned our meet up to her boyfriend but he had gotten mad over us hanging out today, and so it worked better for her to meet on Monday. I know I was the first one to suggest meeting on Monday but the fact that her boyfriend got mad at her because of us meeting after my breakup made me kinda angry. My friend also told me that her and her boyfriend were meeting for lunch and were spending the afternoon together so us meeting in the evening/night wasn’t totally incompatible. She apologized for her boyfriends reaction and not being able to see me today. 

I can of course wait until tomorrow to talk to her but the fact that the reason to change days was her bf’s angry reaction kinda hurt me. They have issues in the relationship (he is dependent and a bit manipulative) and she is trying to work on them. 

So I want to call her out, not cause a scene but tell her that I don’t appreciate the fact that her bf’s issues affected our relationship specially when I was feeling vulnerable and that I hope it does not happen again.

3,1fsc4el,AITA for closing the front door while my boyfriend sprayed a can of raid at a wasps nest?,"Today we noticed a wasps nest growing on our front porch right to the left of our front door. I told my boyfriend about it and he agreed to spray it with raid. I’m standing by the front door while he sprays it and I noticed the screen door and regular door were wide open. He had his foot propping the screen door open so I closed the front door because holy shit I do not want those wasps flying at me right into the house and then use having to chase the wasps around in our house. 

My boyfriend then burst into the house screaming at me for stranding him out there and “locking the door”, which I didn’t do, I just closed it (and it didn’t lock automatically or anything).  It all happened so fast but my reasoning was at least he’s outside and has somewhere to you know back up or run to plus he has a weapon and I don’t and if they fly at me I’ll have way less room to escape to. Whenever my dad would kill wasps nest as a kid he would spray it and stand at a distance and make sure they’re dead maybe spray it again etc.

Either way I felt terrible and started apologizing profusely but that wasn’t enough. He keeps screaming at me tells me I betrayed him and then called me a selfish bitch. Not to mentionI have a wedding shower to be at in 40 minutes, he knows this, and now I’m crying. I said I was sorry so many times and that I didn’t realize he wanted to just spray them and hop back into the house. I truly didn’t think I was doing something mean, just preventing the wasps from flying into the house.

I feel very hurt by his words because he just wouldn’t stop insulting me even after I was apologizing and pleading with him that I didn’t mean to hurt him or put him in a dangerous situation. Idk, part of me feels like if you really love someone you would never call them a bitch like that. My dad never did that to my mom or vice versa even when my dad fell and accidentally stepped on my mom’s foot and broke it. I get that I fucked up here but he didn’t even get stung and it was truly just a mistake. Idk, I’m not sure if I should put this all on me, or rethink the relationship. AITA?

TL;DR boyfriend was spraying a wasps nest with both front doors ajar and I closed one. He lost his mind and called me a selfish bitch. AITA?

5,1fsc1tw,WIBTA if I don't comfort my friend about her dying grandmother?,"Warning: this is pretty immature.

So I'm a college student and so is my friend, R. We had to work in pairs for a class project, making a poster of sorts; and I chose to work with R.

Unfortunately, I hadn't realised that as good a friend R is, she's not the best teammate to have. R has a bunch of extracurriculars as well as familial responsibilities so she's usually very busy and tired.

Prior to this, though, I hadn't really realised the extent of it-- we barely got to discuss the project in person because she always had something else to do. So I decided to do most of the work. All R had to do was write up a few paragraphs, copy them on some pieces of paper and then bring them with her on the day of the submission so we could stick them on the poster. It wasn't a tough project so I didn't really mind.

Now, R was also in another group project for a different class, and another friend of mine, M, is part of that group. M and R don't get along. The day of their presentation, R kept complaining to me that the other group members had made a mistake and weren't listening to her when she said it was wrong. Afterwards I talked to M and the other group members who not only defended their stance but also confided to me that R apparently hadn't contributed at all and had simply sat around while the others did everything. I was surprised but I just told them that I didn't want to talk badly about my friend behind her back, that they should just talk it out with her. 

I thought that was the end of it. But the weekend before R and my project was due, I asked R to send me what she would be writing in case it needed some edits. She sends over her work, the day before the project is due... And it's clearly AI-generated. Completely garbled and unusable. I asked her if it was AI and she said ""Most definitely"", saying the guidelines didn't ban AI so she just used it. I wasn't in the mood to argue so I just said I would do the writing for her, just copy it onto a few pieces of paper like we'd discussed. 

At 11:30 PM the day before the project is due, R messages me saying her grandmother's on her deathbed and she probably wouldn't be making it to class.

Like I said, it wasn't a very tough project, and most of the work I had already dealt with, so doing the tiny bit entrusted to R wasn't hard. I finished it a little after midnight.

But I was very, very frustrated. Because I did it solo, I had to cut corners and the project didn't turn out as well as I think it might have. I'm sorry to say when I read R's message my first instinct wasn't to comfort her, but to get mad, to the point where I began doubting if her grandmother really WAS dying, which is a supremely fucked up thing to think. But at the same time I can't help but feel sorry for myself cause I did 100% of this project and now both of us will get the credit for it. I won't get her in trouble with the professor or anything, but the last thing I want to do right now is comfort her.

8,1fsbjbf,AITA if I ask my parents if I can invite my bf over for Christmas?,"I (21F) have been seeing my boyfriend (25M) for almost a year. I'm sure everyone says this and this will come across as naive while still in the early relationship stage but I do genuinely believe he is my person. I knew from the moment I met him that he is. We've already discussed moving in together, marriage, kids, not that we're in any rush but we've both made it clear that we're sticking together for life.

Within 2 weeks of dating I invited him on holiday with my family as I had a spare ticket (asked if they were okay with that first) and my family adore him. Both my family and my bf had a great time. They said this is the happiest they've seen me in years. And his friends have said the same thing about him. 

Now to the present, I've been discussing Christmas plans with my boyfriend and I am desperate to spend it together. He has been working it the last few years as his family live abroad, so he's requested it off this year. The problem is, I thought my family didn't mind him staying over until recently (I still live with them, and I always ask and wait for them to confirm it's okay) but my mum has said she feels she doesn't see much of me anymore because I stay at his for days at a time (again, always in the loop, will message throughout the time I'm there) and she feels when I do he invades our family time. She said she does like him and she's glad he gets along so well with us all, but she misses having conversations just us two. I still live with my parents and two siblings.  My brother recently went through a breakup so gets a bit upset when he sees me in a relationship, but recently really bonded with him. 

AITA if I ask them if my bf can spend Christmas day with us?

9,1fsbfk9,AITA for yelling at my players for being in the restricted practice room without their team captain ,"My college has an esports team and I'm the captain for the Overwatch 2 team. We also have an esports room that is only accessible through a code that all team captains get along with coaches and officers of the club. We were told not to give the code out to anyone or else we could be removed from the team. The heads are worried about thieves and try to limit it this way. 

Friday night we were supposed to have practice but two of our players couldn't make it so I had cancelled it a few days before practice. It's homecoming week on top of it so it's just busy for everyone. That Friday I got a message asking if we can still practice just the three of us and I said sure I'll be there at the scheduled time. As I'm getting ready one of the players, who is also a good friend of mine, messaged me saying they are already inside and have been practicing the past two hours with another player. They are just waiting on me. 

It's important at this time to note that the doorpad is finicky and I struggle to use it often so my friend and this player is stronger than me and knows how to use it so he helps me. He knows the code just by helping and I thought I could trust him with it. He is also aware that if it's found out I shared it I could get kicked off the team. 

I was incredibly upset that they've been in there the past two hours. If anyone walked in and saw them without me I could get removed from the club. I told them to get out of the room until I could come but they just kept asking me why and fighting me on it over text. My calls weren't going through to them either so I cancelled practice because at that point I'm not okay and I'm incredibly upset. My friend, the player that knew the code, told me that I won't get in trouble and he will just tell the coach, if caught, that he sneaked a peek of the code while I was messing with it. I couldn't get him to see how bad of an idea this was and how it could still fall back on me. He said that I'm being too emotional and kind of an asshole and I'm overreacting. I don't think so but I'm also on my period so maybe I am as it's hard to judge. Am I being the asshole in this situation? 

For more context we are all in our early twenties to late teens. I'm also meant to have a meeting with him about this upcoming on our next practice and if I'm in the wrong I'd like some ideas of what to say.

He's about 95 lbs. There were plenty of other dogs there as well. We were walking through the craft areas and unfortunately his tail swish knocked over a purse rack. (Not the whole rack mind you, just a couple purses from the bottom) I handled the leash over to my husband and I picked up every purse and put them back where they were. The lady at the table said I needed to pay for the purses. I refused to buy the 5 or 6 purses that touched the floor for a few seconds, but in good faith would purchase a purse from her. I selected one, paid and she kept ranting about my dog being allowed in here. I told her it's specifically states it's a dog friendly event (and the location is in general during other times too). She told me he damaged her stuff. (I checked, they are crocheted purses and there wasn't a spec of dirt or grass on them). I told her if she didn't like dogs maybe she should setup at other locations. She told me if I wasn't going to buy anything else to keep walking. I rolled my eyes and walked away.

 My husband is on my side on this but I can't stop thinking about the interaction. If he had knocked over something and it broke I would have 100% paid for it! He is very good in public spaces and we've never had a problem. He waits for people to approach him, doesn't jump, and never barks! (Disclaimer: we are NOT those people. He goes to dog friendly places only as he is not a service dog!) But maybe I should have just bought them....AITA?


Edit to add: I've brought it up in the comments but I'd like to add some context. The event was not crowded, this was a very large event at our county park sponsored by a local animal rescue. There was a dog beauty pageant during the event (and a chicken one too!). This was 100% a dog friendly place and there were tons of dogs, some even bigger than mine. My dog was fully under control, but yes his tail wags! I didn't think this was going to be the thing everyone would focus on. I was requesting judgement on the purse incident. If an item doesn't break or get damaged when it falls, does it need to be purchased? Should I have bought them? I will fully accept the judgement that I'm an AH about how I handled the vendor situation, but my dog being there is not up for judgement.

She then proceeded to scoff at me and tell me it was no big deal and that car crashes happen all the time. And that all that matters is that she almost crashed, but she didn't.

I screamed at her for that, which, yeah, probably wasn't the best thing to do, but I was just trying to get her to understand that the fact that she almost crashed is still fucked and we almost died and I have a right to be freaked the fuck out.

Am I the asshole for flipping out on her like that?

17,1fsa643,AITA for wanting a bridal shower? ,"I’m getting married soon and my MOH has been having some issues with my bridal party. She decided she could not handle my bridal shower about 2 months ago because I wasn’t helping her plan it and she became very stressed. Then, she dropped out of my wedding, after a spat about my other bridesmaids not being able to afford or get time off for a 4 to 5 day cruise bachelorette party she wanted to do. I ended up going to Houston, Texas with the other girls, because one of my bridesmaids lives there and we had a great time, although it’s not what I had originally planned. Around the time of this, my MOH decided she wanted to be friends again and be in the wedding. I forgave her and told her she could. We went to Disneyland for a weekend, just the two of us, as our “bachelorette trip” and had a good time. Flash forward to now. I asked someone to plan my bridal shower because I feel like this is a once in a lifetime thing. I only get to be a bride once, so I want to do everything to the fullest. So I hired someone to plan the party and she created a group chat with all of my bridesmaids and MOH. MOH texts me separately asking “what is this” I told her I had hired someone to do the party and she said “umm okay. I attempted to do that months ago.” I said “yes but you then told me you were no longer going to do it, before you dropped out of the wedding. So I have someone else planning it.” She then got offended and said it made her look bad as a MOH and I told her that I’m just asking for the bare minimum as a bride and that I want all the bridal things because I only get to do this once. She then blocked me. I guess she is out of the wedding again. So, am I the asshole for wanting a bridal shower? 

Edit: so I think some people are getting confused so I’d like to clear up a couple of things. 
1. I did not ask her to plan a second bachelorette for just us. She did that of her own volition. I only asked her to plan the original bachelorette party she ended up not coming to. And even that I ended up planning myself because of her fighting with the other bridesmaids and cancelling. 
2. Bachelorette party and Bridal shower are 2 separate events and both are normal to have as a soon to be bride. She agreed to plan both of these as my MOH. 

I hope this clears up some confusion. 

Edit #2: okay I need to clear something else up which is that the MOH quit the wedding the first time because my bridesmaids were unable to attend a 4-5 day long bachelorette party, which I completely understood but she did not and said they were not being good friends and should just show up regardless of cost or time off. I told her it was ridiculous to ask that of them and she disagreed and said I was settling for a less than satisfactory bachelorette party (I never said was unhappy with anything) and quit the wedding. I never asked anyone to pay for or attend a 4-5 day long bachelorette party. My MOH did and everyone told her no (including me). Hope that clears up the confusion surrounding the first bachelorette trip.

19,1fsa233,AITA for breaking up with my queerplatonic partner for a romantic relationship?,"Okay just for some context, I found what I honestly thought was my soulmate back in February. Let's call them Ashe. Ashe is aroace but we just clicked so well we ended up agreeing on a queerplatonic relationship. (Just look it up if you don't know what it means.)

We had been dating for five months happily when I started having feelings again for an ex (let's call her Marlene). For reference, at the time I was seeing her every day at my work but not Ashe since they had been busy during summer. Turned out, Marlene (who was friends with Ashe) had been texting Ashe about how she had feelings for *me.* But I was committed to Ashe and so when they swatted away the idea, I did as well.

Flash forwards to July and these feelings haven't gone away. Not only that, but they've exponentially multiplied over that month when I didn't really either Marlene or Ashe. Obviously I went to Ashe to make sure that if I tried to start this it would be okay with them. They said yes, if not a little tentatively.

So for all of August Ashe was navigating being jealous of me and Marlene's blooming relationship, while I was enjoying my first real romantic relationship. Apparently during all of this Marlene didn't know me and Ashe were still dating (which baffles me) but at some point when me and Ashe are doing queerplatonic affection things (just like holding hands), she became jealous.

One thing lead to another and then in two weeks Marlene was asking me to choose between her and Ashe. Now I have been a people pleaser all my life. Even in this situation I was trying to reassure Ashe that I didn't care about Marlene more because obviously we had been together for longer and they were *so* special to me. (That was totally a subconscious thing that was really bad in retrospect, but I'll use it here as an example.) So I went back and forth a few times but in the end chose Marlene because I couldn't deny that romance just had more depth than queerplatonic love, and I wanted to be a little selfish with a decision like this.

This whole choice thing completely destroyed me, I was depressed for a full week. But now I've committed to Marlene, dumping Ashe for once and for all. Ashe is not taking this well (obviously) but I know they're trying their best because we STILL TALK LIKE EVERY DAY. What makes all this worse is that we're still in school and sit together so Ashe has to see me and Marlene being a couple every day.

At this point Marlene hates Ashe for trying to break us up and Ashe is just trying to get out of the rat's nest. All of that in mind, Ashe still clearly feels betrayed and it stings even worse because they're aroace.

The morning she was supposed to get back, I realized I had eaten pretty much all her food in the apartment and panicked. A few hours before she got back, I texted her and said the big storm we just had over the weekend cut our power and flooded a small portion next to the back door (close to where she stores her snacks), and therefore I had to toss all of her food she had in the house.

She lives about 2 hours away from our college campus apartment so she was gone almost 2 full days. I stayed in on the Friday night and got hungry. I finished off my snacks pretty quick into the night but wanted more. Because of a bad storm, I couldn’t go out and get more food or DoorDash something, so I ate some of my roommate’s food (ice cream, frozen pizza, cereal, a bag of chips etc). Since I ran out of most of my food that night, I continued eating her food throughout the weekend. The morning she was supposed to get back, I realized I had eaten pretty much all her food in the apartment and panicked. A few hours before she got back, I texted her and said the big storm we just had over the weekend cut our power and flooded a small portion next to the back door (close to where she stores her snacks), and therefore I had to toss all of her food she had in the house. She came back that night with new groceries totaling $100+ but doesn’t suspect a thing. I’m conflicted on what to do now cause I don’t want to pay her back for the food but if she finds out somehow, it could ruin our friendship.

They lost power this week due to the hurricane and won't get it back until next Saturday. My sister asked my mom if she can bring my niece and nephew to stay with her this week and she agreed. She is going to meet my sister halfway now to get them.

We are supposed to be going to a wedding this week in another state, but my husband and son (5) were staying home because it is too expensive for flights and it is my cousin's wedding anyway who he doesn't know well. It is also a child free wedding. My sister was going to take her kids and they were coming to the rehearsal party but staying with another relative in the same city for the wedding night.

My mom just called me and asked if my husband would watch the kids instead. My husband is hesitant because he has to work, has to get my son to school everyday, and they would just be here. He is just uncomfortable doing it himself. I told my mother I can stay home and help him but she is adamant I go. She doesn't see the big deal because they are teenagers that don't do anything but that is not true. They always complain that they are bored constantly. I know it will be hard for him to handle all 3 for 3 days plus the pets.

My mother is pissed now because she doesn't understand why we are pushing back. She also got angry because I asked her if my sister knew she was calling me and why won't she call me herself to ask, to which she replied of course she does, what is the big deal?!!

My sister has enough money to change their flights to come out of our city instead so I don't understand why we aren't keeping that plan.

26,1fs92k9,AITA for going to my grandma-in-law’s funeral?,"The long and short is I (32m) was married to my ex wife ""Vivian"" for about 9 years. We separated a year and a half ago due to her infidelity and were in the process of divorcing when she tragically and suddenly passed away from a heart condition. 

Most of her family didn't know the circumstances of our separation because we were trying to keep things as civil as possible to coparent our son (3m), but Vivian's parents did.

I met my current wife ""Allison"" (32f) when I was in college and we became friends. She and my ex were close as well, and when Vivian and I used to live with her parents Allison would visit us frequently and my in-laws always welcomed her.

After everything went down with Vivian both with the cheating and her death, Allison and I got a lot closer and we started dating. My ex's parents and her brother were understandably devastated by her death but they took the news of Allison and I dating very coldly. 

About six months after we started dating Vivian's grandma passed, who I had been rather close with as well. Allison and I made plans to attend the funeral with my son, but Vivian's parents all but barred us at the door and said only my son should be there, and made it pointedly clear that Allison was not welcome. They offered to watch my son so he could attend if I wanted to drop him off. I didn't want him to miss it so Allison and I left my son with them and we went to a bar. 

I'll admit I drank a bit more than I should have, and Allison and I commiserated most of the time about how they had treated her when we thought neither of us had done anything wrong. 

Here's where I might be the AH: there was a celebration of life after the funeral at my in-laws' house, and they said they would meet us in the driveway to send my son back. When we got there I tried to get in touch but no one answered their phone. We could clearly see people in the yard, so Allison and I got out and started mingling. I was also very hurt that I wasn't able to be there at the funeral to honor Nanna, so part of me wanting to join everyone in the yard was to be part of her celebration of life.

She recently has been trying to get more into A's interests so she has been there for our games. She doesn't play with us, just kind of watches and plays on her phone, which is fine of course.



A has a table he set up specifically for the game, one with a recessed middle so we don't have to put away our stuff at the end he just puts a leaf over the top to protect it.

The problem is that when I lean forward to move my character my breasts squish against the side of the table and after awhile it gets uncomfortable and painful.

About 8 months into our relationship, I found out that she was vaping with one of her friends (who by the way, is a really really bad influence, especially when my gf already has an addictive personality). It made me really uncomfortable and I was very fair with her - by telling her that as long as she didn’t do it around me, I wouldn’t care - but then it kept getting worse.

now i’m feeling guilty because i didn’t want to throw him under the bus, but at the same time, i didn’t want to face detention for something i didn’t do. my other friends are kind of split on it, with some saying i did the right thing and others saying i should’ve kept my mouth shut.

With my father we don't have a bad relationship, he is a good man and very loved by his friends. 
I know that he loves me and i know that I'm breaking his heart not answering or telling him that i will fly tomorrow and staying one month in my country.
 But the thing is that I really really really don't want to see him, its makes me sad, but. only stress me so much
My father is a man that doesn't recognise that in a grown woman (34) he talks to me as a baby and wants to cuddle with me as if I'm 5 years old,  when I rejected him , makes as he doesn't listen and doesn't changed his attitude towards me, it makes me sick, also because visiting him means that i have to travel almost 10 hours by bus to his house where i don't know if there will be a room for me in a separate place, and ask him to come to meet me in my birth city is also complicated because he has no place to stay and I m at my mom's.
 the last time i was there was also because my older brother died and i wanted to spend some time with my father, i arranged everything and i couldn't feel empathy towards him and  he wanted me to hug him but I couldn't... during all my life my father hasn't been a person that i could trust, many times he forgot about me and didn't arrive to our meeting or fallen asleep and not hearing the doorbell and leave me waiting for Hours outside his house, and when he opens the door he didn't have anything prepared so i had to cook for us... he was always late at my school events, graduation or competitions
I habe been feeling so heartbroken so many time by him, and he doesn't even say sorry, his attitude is like uff its already in the past, nothing to do about it.
Later I knew from my mom that he was spending my mom's money and never returned it saying that they where a marriage and they share everything.
Of course he had never returned my mom's money wish makes me super angry at him, he scam her.
can pass more than 6 months and he doesn't reach to me, but when I do his always shaming me for not taking contact.

 he even got married and didn't told me.

I ordered a meal in advance for her family, thinking some could be shared with her friends too. When they arrived, no one brought any food, and some had small kids with them. We ended up sharing what I brought.

Two of her friends later went to get chips and drinks, but I noticed there wasn’t enough for everyone, especially the kids. So, I ordered pizza online, thinking it would be better than nothing. One of her friends even mentioned that she assumed I’d be ordering food since her kid would be eating rice.

I also learned that one friend brings in only $13 a week, another is out of work, and the third just returned from working in the Middle East and doesn’t make much. Meanwhile, my partner and I combined make $10,000 a month. I thought sharing would be considerate, especially since I was meeting some of them for the first time. I’m all about being thoughtful and often offer to share or pitch in.

When I got home, my partner called me “controlling” and said I shouldn’t have ordered anything. I’m confused because I only wanted to ensure there was enough food for everyone. Why do I look like the bad person here?

The kids were great, and I didn’t mind helping out. But the next weekend, they asked again. Then again the next.

What started as one Saturday has now turned into me babysitting both Saturday and Sunday, every weekend. They drop the kids off at 9 AM and pick them up around 7 PM. That’s two full days of childcare—no pay, no food brought for the kids, no consideration for my time. I work full-time during the week, so my weekends are my only time to relax, hang out with friends, or get things done.

I finally told Hannah I couldn’t babysit one weekend because I had made plans with friends. She got upset, saying that I didn’t understand how hard it was for her and Jake to maintain their relationship and that their marriage was struggling. She implied that my refusal to help could make things worse between them, which made me feel really guilty. She said I was being selfish and that I should step up as family.

I tried to compromise by offering to babysit once or twice a month, but Hannah said that wasn’t enough. She said since I don’t have kids, I don’t understand the stress they’re under and that they need this time for their relationship to survive. Now, both Hannah and Jake are upset with me, and even my parents are weighing in, saying I should just help out “for the sake of family.”

She moved when I was 7 because her husband got a new job and wanted a better life for his kids. Mom wanted to take me. She and dad battled it out in court. I was asked what I wanted by a judge. It was a really bad time for me. I told the judge I wanted my mom but didn't want to leave my dad, my friends or my family. I told him I really didn't want to go. She was really kind to me. I don't remember everything she said. But I do remember her apologizing for me being in that position. She decided to give dad custody of me and gave mom summer parenting time and weekly calls to me. I begged mom not to leave. She told me she had to but wanted me to come with them. I told her I didn't want to leave dad behind but I didn't want to be left behind. She left and told me nothing much would change.

For a while the calls were great and all. But then she started putting her her stepkids (who were under 5 when mom and her husband moved) on the phone after 2 minutes of us talking. The calls were meant to be for her and me. But she wanted me to ""keep the bond"" with her stepkids. I never had a bond with them so the calls sucked and I started ending the calls when she would pass the phone to everyone else. Mom never came back on the phone so I didn't need to stay on the phone. She'd correct me for it and I'd tell her I wanted to talk to her and not them. The calls stayed on the court order but they were at most 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes. 

Summers I spent 5-7 weeks with mom. She'd act so excited to see me but we never really got time for just us. Her stepkids were always added on because her husband would be at work and when he'd get home he'd join us. I asked for time with just my mom and she'd ignore me. I grew more resentful of it all.

My dad died right before I was due to fly out to mom's. I don't want to live with her so I asked my grandparents if they could file for custody quickly. There was an emergency hearing because of the situation and mom had to fly out for it. She wanted custody. She told the judge. But the judge said I could temporarily stay with my grandparents until a formal court date. Court is a little over a week away.

My mom has tried to convince me to move in with her. She told me I should be with my family and my parents. I told her she's my only parent left but she chose her husband and his kids over me before so why should I choose her now. She told me I should understand that she didn't want to end her marriage over a good opportunity and how I could have gone with them. She told me she couldn't let his kids down after she became mom to them. I told her she could separate me from one of my parents. Then I pointed out she prioritized them over me.

she arrived at the buffet about half an hour later than us, but we still had an hour left. this is where i was the asshole; me and my other friends had began to eat already. she sat down, didn’t eat anything, before throwing my birthday presents from friends at school, (it’d been my birthday a few days previously,) shouted ‘here’s your fucking present, i’m going home.’ she hadn’t bought a birthday present for friend 1, who was the actual birthday person, and had tried calling her to offer to pick her up from the train station after her panicked phone call but had been hung up on.

now, here’s my issue—i may be the asshole. i know she has stricter parents who would be worried if they knew she had walked to and from on her own. we couldn’t have pushed the bookings back, and i could’ve always waited for her, but i feel like since i told her that i wasn’t going to that made matters okay. our friendship as of recent hasn’t been very steady, so i was rather begrudging about matters and didn’t apologize immediately when she arrived at the buffet, and instead carried on eating. although this may have made me an asshole, she handled it poorly and all the people i’ve recounted the story to so far have told me i was in the right, but that is because many have had bad experiences with her previously. however, i would like some unbiased opinions, because thinking about it now my reluctance to apologize for the misunderstanding made me seem immature. no matter how she handled it, i was definitely not being the bigger person.

43,1fs3qh4,AITA for choosing to do something last minute so I won't have to do something for my dad and step-mom?,"I (15F) have divorced parents with split custody. My dad and his wife have four kids (10M, 7F, 3F, and an under 1-year-old). My dad and wife tend to get stressed easily so they go out a few times a month and I'm always asked to watch my step/half-sibs.

I love my step/half-siblings and I've watched them a few times but it's overwhelming. The baby is fussy and needs to be held 24/7, 3F is destructive, 7F always wants to do something with me and I just can't so she throw fits and screams. Then, 10M is sweet, but he gets away with a lot of things but he's always excused of being a boy so when I'm watching, he thinks he can do whatever he wants.

My dad's house is perpetually messy and I'm expected to clean it. There's been times where they haven't kept much food in the fridge so I'm expected to pay for pizza with my own money too. I'm also supposed to be watching them for 1-2 hours but it always turns to more and I have missed events because of it.

I've come up with ways to deal with it. I've joined a lot of clubs/stay to study for my ap classes so they aren't able to leave the kids home alone until I get home from school to watch them anymore. I can always do volunteering over the weekend too, so they can't just leave the house unannounced anymore.

I'm on my dad's time this week and friday they asked me to watch the kids yesterday because they were overwhelmed and needed a night to themsleves.

I didn't get a response from one of them regarding whether his girlfriend was coming or not, so I ended up asking her directly. She told me that she was not aware of this and that that weekend they had planned a romantic trip. We looked at the dates of the discussions together and in fact it had been a month that my ''friend'' continued to say that he was coming to my birthday when he was in the process of planning this trip. When his girlfriend tried to confront him about it, he claimed that he had never confirmed that he was coming, we were able to show him in the discussion that this was false. Yet I have always been there for this friend, even going so far as to host him for 3 months during a difficult period for him. Besides the fact that he didn't come to my birthday, what shocks me the most is his behavior afterwards. At no time did he tell me that he wasn't coming, I discovered it by chance. He lied to me and wanted to make people believe that he had never confirmed. He is someone I am very close to, this situation is completely beyond me. Since then, I have not been able to talk to him.

Hello, here's the story: I planned my birthday so that my three best friends would be there, so I asked them about their availability, if they had any specific wishes or ideas for that evening, etc. I had clearly indicated that I was choosing the date based on them to make sure they would be there. I didn't get a response from one of them regarding whether his girlfriend was coming or not, so I ended up asking her directly. She told me that she was not aware of this and that that weekend they had planned a romantic trip. We looked at the dates of the discussions together and in fact it had been a month that my ''friend'' continued to say that he was coming to my birthday when he was in the process of planning this trip. When his girlfriend tried to confront him about it, he claimed that he had never confirmed that he was coming, we were able to show him in the discussion that this was false. Yet I have always been there for this friend, even going so far as to host him for 3 months during a difficult period for him. Besides the fact that he didn't come to my birthday, what shocks me the most is his behavior afterwards. At no time did he tell me that he wasn't coming, I discovered it by chance. He lied to me and wanted to make people believe that he had never confirmed. He is someone I am very close to, this situation is completely beyond me. Since then, I have not been able to talk to him.

51,1fs264d,AITA for refusing to babysit my brother after school?,"I'm 17 and in my final year of highschool. I have a little brother who we'll call James (age 5), who is in the process of getting an autism and adhd diagnosis.

I love James, he's a really sweet kid. Since he isn't able to keep many friends with his social difficulties, I'm the only person he really talks to on a daily basis. We're really close, but that's kind of the problem.

The problem arose when I started my final year of highschool, and my workload increased. I'm planning on getting into medical school after high school, and I'm in gifted education, so my study schedule is very rigorous. My brother has no understanding of this of course, so he's been very upset for the past few months that I've been studying so much.

My brother is always ecstatic when I get home, rambling about what games we should play, and planning hours of stuff for us to do. And every day I have to remind him, ""Sorry buddy, I have study / homework/ assignments. Maybe later?"" So instead, he sits in my room with me and plays with toys or his iPad.

 Problem is, it's *impossible* to study when he's in my room. Due to his audhd, he's constantly jumping, making noise, rolling around, muttering to himself ect. He can't control it, I don't blame him, but it's **very** distracting. 

I'm not talking about regular kid babbling. He **never** stops making noise.

And more recently, since he's alone for so many hours, he's started to get upset to the point of tears if I don't play with him for at least an hour after school each day. He's even started hiding my stuff for attention. He hid my phone for a week before I found it in his laundry.

I can't always play with him, and my parents don't understand that.

Any time he makes noise, runs around, or plays with toys too loud, my parents will yell at me. They believe that since I'm the oldest sibling, and they have full time jobs, that it's my responsibility to make sure that he's eating healthy, not making any mess and not making too much noise (which if you've ever met a 5 year old you know is impossible, especially James).

It's really hard for me to keep up with my studies like this. I failed a calculus test recently, and my other class grades are slipping too. My parents don't seem to be worried, but I am. 

So I made a plan that I'd stay two hours after school every second day, so i could study in peace in the library. Then, when i came home I could give my undivided attention to my brother until he fell asleep, then continue my work after his bedtime. My parents already pick up my brother from school, so he could be taken care of by them until i came back at 5:30pm.

After the week of this, my mum confronted me. She told me that my brother was too distracting and hard to take care of while she had to do emails for work. She was also upset that he wouldn't eat the food she made, because I always prepare his after school snacks.

I told her that if he was too distracting for her, how was I expected to study with him?

She told me that I was being disrespectful, and that I was prioritising myself over the family's needs. She also said that since my dad has had a bad injury for the past few months, that I was putting unfair pressure on her to take care of the whole family.

That was never my intention. I never wanted to disrespect her, or harm the family. I just don't have enough time in the day to keep my grades up, complete my assignments and babysit my brother. i already work from 10am to 11pm every saturday and sunday, and i give all the money to my parents to help out. I offered to quit my job instead so I could study on the weekends, but they told me that was a bad decision. I tried to arrange for James to have playdates and after school activities, but his behaviour is too ""unmanageable"" for most parents and instructors (usually just stimming too much, or constantly speaking).

 I don't know what else to do, but something has to give. So far, it's just been my mental health. I've literally been shaking every day for the past three weeks, because I'm so worried about all of my due assignments. Sometimes I find that even when I do have time to study, I just sit there paralysed with anxiety because I don't know how long it will be until I'm interrupted, or my brother draws on my work again, or my parents need me, or my boss calls me in for an unexpected shift I can't say no to, or.... and by the time I realise I'm doing it it's 11pm and there's no time left. My parents have been supportive with that, but the main issue still stays. (If anyone has advice for anxiety i will sell you my kidneys in trade for it).

I can't keep babysitting my brother, and i'm not going to stop going to the library.

52,1fs1xv0,AITA for calling my SIL a jealous stick in the mud?,"

I (36M) have been married to my wife (37F) for 15 years now. My wife absolutely loves the SNL Totino’s sketches; and by love I mean: watches them at least twice a month, and dies laughing every time. She’s weird, but I love her.

So, during quarantine, I got into 3D printing, and my wife even got me my own 3D printer for Christmas 2020. In 2021, before football season started, I got the idea of making her her own Totino’s Super Bowl Activity Pack (it’s from the sketches), and she absolutely loved it, couldn’t stop talking about it even months later. And because of that, I always make her a new one every year.

This year, my brother finally proposed to his long term girlfriend (late 20s), and they moved closer to us, so we invited them to watch the first game of the season with us. They were there when I gave my wife her activity pack of the year, and I said (verbatim BTW): I was going to give you a different Totino’s experience this year, but arranging a life changing lesbian experience with my friend’s hot sister was a bit hard to swing; so, here’s another activity pack to pass the time while we watch the game.

It was a joke, it was *very obviously* a joke, she laughed so hard she had tears in her eyes, until my SIL went and ruined the mood. She got upset about me: infantilising my wife, oversexualising lesbian relationships, being a misogynistic prick… it was a long rant, that’s what I remember off the top of my head.

We were all surprised and shocked, my wife looked at me, I looked back, then we both turned to my brother. He was just standing there not knowing what to do. And here’s where I might be the AH. instead of just explaining that it is an inside joke, offering to show the source material of said joke, or just deescalating; I went and said: You must be really fun in parties, it’s a joke, and the person that was meant to get it (pointing at my wife) seems to like it, so what’s your problem?

She doubled down, my brother finally unfroze and showed her the videos, but she still said that she stood by what she said.

So I just asked her to leave, and told her that I don’t want a jealous stick in the mud to ruin a funny tradition I have with my wife.

She left in a huff, my brother followed her, and now both of them, as well as my parents are asking me to apologise for my comments and saying that I behaved like an AH. so AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-29,"AITA for calling my SIL a jealous stick in the mud?

While Jordyn lives with my sister and has nothing to do with his dad, per his dad's own choice.

My sister and Jamie's dad were not on good terms. My sister cheated on Jamie's dad with Jordyn's dad. She also admitted to cheating on Jamie's dad before Jamie was born and Jamie's dad had to do a DNA test to be sure Jamie was his bio son. It was a mess. She really jerked him around. When Jordyn's dad left her, my sister liked to the woman Jamie's dad was dating at the time and claimed Jordyn was his. This broke them up and even though he isn't the father, my sister expected him to ""do the right thing"" for both of her children. Her expectation for Jamie's dad to step up for Jordyn never ended.

Jordyn was naturally upset, jealous and had a lot of feelings from a young age about Jamie having what he didn't and because Jamie had a lot more and did a lot more because his dad could afford that. Jamie's life was very different to Jordyn's. And Jamie never wanted to invite Jordyn to his dad's house or to places his dad would take him. Eventually Jordyn started saying negative things about Jamie's dad and Jamie would defend his dad. Their relationship had never been close before this but once those fights became very common, it was very nasty between them. My sister blames Jamie's dad for this even though she never explained things to Jordyn correctly. I tried a couple of times but my sister had made him feel like he had a right to expect more from Jamie's dad.

The last time Jamie was in the house, he told Jordyn they weren't brothers and they weren't family. And Jordyn wished Jamie's dad dead. They have not spoken since. I still see and speak to both boys. My sister doesn't like this. She doesn't like that Jamie has been to my house since he moved out of hers. So she came over the other day and confronted me about touch with Jamie and keep him a part of my family even though he refuses to be a part of theirs. She complained for about 20 minutes about this and it came across very childish to me. Almost like when kids are like you can't be friends with her because I'm not. I told her to grow up and act like the mother she's meant to be and not like a middle grader. She told me I should be more understanding and less shitty to her.

Jamie's life was very different to Jordyn's. And Jamie never wanted to invite Jordyn to his dad's house or to places his dad would take him. Eventually Jordyn started saying negative things about Jamie's dad and Jamie would defend his dad. Their relationship had never been close before this but once those fights became very common, it was very nasty between them. My sister blames Jamie's dad for this even though she never explained things to Jordyn correctly. I tried a couple of times but my sister had made him feel like he had a right to expect more from Jamie's dad.

The last time Jamie was in the house, he told Jordyn they weren't brothers and they weren't family. And Jordyn wished Jamie's dad dead. They have not spoken since. I still see and speak to both boys. My sister doesn't like this. She doesn't like that Jamie has been to my house since he moved out of hers. So she came over the other day and confronted me about touch with Jamie and keep him a part of my family even though he refuses to be a part of theirs. She complained for about 20 minutes about this and it came across very childish to me. Almost like when kids are like you can't be friends with her because I'm not. I told her to grow up and act like the mother she's meant to be and not like a middle grader. She told me I should be more understanding and less shitty to her.

57,1fs04ss,AITA for going to a Coldplay concert without my friend who really wanted to go?,"So, here’s the situation: my friends and I (we're all Indian) were super excited about Coldplay coming to India. One of my friends, let's call him Ash, is a *huge* fan and was the one who first asked me to go. Initially, it was going to be Ash, Dom, me, and another friend, Ashley. We were all hyped to go together.

When the tickets went on sale, it was chaos with the queue system, and none of us managed to get tickets—except for Dom’s friend, who ended up getting 4 tickets. So now, Dom, his friend, his friend's girlfriend, and I are going, but that leaves Ash and Ashley without tickets.

I’m really torn here. I love Coldplay too, but Ash was the one who was so excited and invited me first. I asked him if it was okay for me to go without him, and he said yes, but I can’t help but feel like I’m ditching him and Ashley, and that he might be hurt even though he said it’s fine.

AITA for going to the concert and leaving Ash and Ashley behind, even though they were part of the original plan? Should I skip it out of solidarity?

We used to date a bit, but nothing exclusive or too serious and we stopped a few days ago. She always had a tendency to cut me off to correct me on the type of language I use. Sometimes because I'm being too vulgar for her taste, other times because she feels like I'm imposing my opinion when I'm just expressing it. (For instance, one time, I said I liked the architecture of the neighborhood we were in, and thought it'd be nice if the city I live in had a more diverse architecture. She corrected me, telling me I should not want to change the world to fit with my personal tastes). 

She invited me to her friend's birthday. I did not know anyone but her there, and I was excited to meet new people. I arrive and I start chatting with the person around me. I overhear the guy in front of me commenting about how ridiculous one of his coworker is for wanting to quit her job, which requires 9 years of school, to become an hairdresser instead. The type of degree she would have to get is the one my brother got (he's not an hairdresser, it's just the same type of formation), he was not good in school, and a lot of people around us looked on him for that very reason. 

My friend is aware that this is the kind of things I take seriously.

I start feeling myself get angry, and I can see he's enjoying it, which pisses me off even more.

65,1fry0gn,AITA for not agreeing I set off an alarm because I'm white,"
We have a home security system that includes a motion detector 
It arms automatically at a set time.
Last night, I was upstairs in bed when my husband texted me and said the alarm had not auto armed.  Sometimes, he opens windows, and in that case, the system will show an ""error zone open"" message.   I checked, and from the app, the system looked like it was armed. 
A side note here the system can be armed from a hub and a key pad. Both downstairs.
This to me ment there was some other problem so I went to investigate. As I reached the halfway point down the stairs, the motion detector caught me, and the alarm sounded.
My husband is now angry with me and is calling the system racist.  He isn't white. He thinks the motion detector didn't catch him because of this. 
Forget that he's set off the alarm before when forgetting to disarm before going downstairs after it armed.  No, it's racism. And I'm a whole string of derogatory words for not seeing this and being on his side.

Maybe   I used a tone I didn't intend to or that I somehow managed to make the motion detector not detect him that one time. Maybe I even armed it before walking down.  But to defend myself there If I armed it, it counts down for 2 minutes and beeps the whole time. It would be hard to miss if I armed it.   Anyway. Feel free to assume I'm also wrong. Because he certainly thinks I am.

The conversation went something like this

Me ""Seems to be working""
Husband  ""This alarm is a racist pos."" 
M ""What? What does race have to do with it?""
H ""You never support me! It went off because it can see you. ""
M ""it detects motion""
H ""No, it didn't work. I was down here it should go off. I was walking around everywhere,""
M ""Okay, but it went off now. So clearly, it worked this time. "" 
 And then he started calling me names and repeating, ""we have to cancel the system  it won't go off. it's because it can't see me."" 

M ""but you set it off before"" 
H "" You are stupid.""

I went back upstairs


To sum up, the armed system didn't go off when he was walking around downstairs.
However, it did catch me.  He thinks I'm a horrible person for setting off the alarm and not agreeing that the security system is racist.

",Not the A-hole,2024-09-29,"AITA for not agreeing I set off an alarm because I'm white 
We have a home security system that includes a motion detector 
It arms automatically at a set time.
Last night, I was upstairs in bed when my husband texted me and said the alarm had not auto armed.  Sometimes, he opens windows, and in that case, the system will show an ""error zone open"" message.   I checked, and from the app, the system looked like it was armed. 
A side note here the system can be armed from a hub and a key pad. Both downstairs.
This to me ment there was some other problem so I went to investigate. As I reached the halfway point down the stairs, the motion detector caught me, and the alarm sounded.
My husband is now angry with me and is calling the system racist.  He isn't white. He thinks the motion detector didn't catch him because of this. 
Forget that he's set off the alarm before when forgetting to disarm before going downstairs after it armed.  No, it's racism. And I'm a whole string of derogatory words for not seeing this and being on his side.

Maybe   I used a tone I didn't intend to or that I somehow managed to make the motion detector not detect him that one time. Maybe I even armed it before walking down.  But to defend myself there If I armed it, it counts down for 2 minutes and beeps the whole time. It would be hard to miss if I armed it.   Anyway. Feel free to assume I'm also wrong. Because he certainly thinks I am.

The conversation went something like this

Me ""Seems to be working""
Husband  ""This alarm is a racist pos."" 
M ""What? What does race have to do with it?""
H ""You never support me! It went off because it can see you. ""
M ""it detects motion""
H ""No, it didn't work. I was down here it should go off. I was walking around everywhere,""
M ""Okay, but it went off now. So clearly, it worked this time. "" 
 And then he started calling me names and repeating, ""we have to cancel the system  it won't go off. it's because it can't see me."" 

M ""but you set it off before"" 
H "" You are stupid.""

I went back upstairs


To sum up, the armed system didn't go off when he was walking around downstairs.
However, it did catch me.  He thinks I'm a horrible person for setting off the alarm and not agreeing that the security system is racist. 

So aita?  Should I agree that the motion detector didn't activate the alarm because he isn't light skinned enough?  It's become an issue he's pretty upset that I don't think that was the problem.

Thanks

66,1frxvan,AITAH because I didn’t invite two of my friends to my birthday get together?,"I know how the title might seem, but it’s different than what you might think. a few weeks before my birthday, I wanted to throw just a small party with some of my friends, if I wanted to invite everyone it would be 7 people which means I would have to do it at my house, making it extremely crowded forcing my family to have to deal with that too. But that wasn’t the problem at all, the problems started when two of my friends, let’s call them Lilly and Abigail started complaining to me about Sam because Sam started a problem between them. Now both of my groups were talking about each other in front of me. And I am much closer to Lilly and Abigail because they talk to me outside of school, we hang out frequently etc, Sam and the other girl, Amanda don’t talk to me at all outside of school. Because of their argument, I thought maybe I should just do separate things even though it would be very expensive, but I just didn’t want anybody to be upset because I know i would be upset if that happened to me. One day, I was having lunch with Amanda and Sam when they started complaining about Abigail and Lilly,  she was telling me how she doesn’t really like them anymore and then Sam agreed and said they were bothering her stuff and like that. Then I brought up how I was going to do two separate things for my birthday and Sam said “yeah please don’t invite them”  So I decided to do something on Friday and then on Saturday, but, I ended up getting sick my entire birthday week (keep in mind Sam didn’t ask me where I was or how I was doing at all). I was thinking of cancelling both parties, but I decided to pull through for my birthday on Saturday instead of Friday because it would be further away which gave me more time, and was bigger so it would be harder to cancel, doing this ment I couldn’t do what I wanted to with Sam and Amanda but honestly I wasn’t thinking about that because I was sick and trying to setup everything for Saturday. The 4 people I ended up inviting, I’m really close with, we talk every day, we hang out frequently, etc. Lilly posted us with my cake on instagram and they saw it and they were texting each other and then Sam sent me a message showing me the screenshot of the story, then she unadded me before I could say anything back and explain to her, and on Snapchat if you unadd somebody they can’t text you, so what I did was I texted her in an old group chat we had together with nobody in it, and I texted her explaining everything. I told her I wanted to do some thing with her and Amanda  but I couldn’t because I got sick, and I didn’t want to put them all in a room together if they were arguing because it would be awkward, and honestly if she wanted to handle it this way then I don’t know what to say to her, she then left the group chat and she removed me on every social media.

67,1frxsx5,AITA I told him I would never again bake him something ,"My husband is lactose intolerant but he likes banana cake.

For his birthday, I baked a two layer banana cake and made the recipe of a vegan frosting and a vegan toffee sauce that was really good!

When we were going to sing the usual Happy Birthday song, he stood up and was walking over the cake table while I was saying that I had baked a banana cake for him with vegan frosting and sauce.

His answer, in front of everyone, was that he didn’t know why I had baked him some cake if I already knew he didn’t like them because he has not eaten in so many years that he doesn’t even like it anymore.

I felt hurt and didn’t say a thing there. I thought that he would appreciate me baking a cake for his birthday because that’s what his mom used to do when he was a kid and he always makes a comment about me not baking the kids’ cakes. 

Every time I go to the local bakery, I get him a banana cake and he eats it and says how much he likes it.

The rest of the celebration, I was trying to act normal, but he noticed and when everyone left, he asked if I was ok. I said I was never going to bake him something. His answer was, thank you and that I was being unfair with him because I should have already know.

Worst of all of this was that, my birthday is the same day as his. So I baked another cake for me because I wanted a chocolate cake, but this is just venting.

69,1frxdaj,AITA for refusing to watch my parents dogs while they go on family vacation without me?,"My family is going on a cruise in a couple months and I am not going. My sister organized this cruise with her boyfriends family and invited my parents to join. Then after they all made their cruise plans and decided what time/destination/price was best for them, she invited me and some of our other extended family, thinking the more the merrier. I spent a lot of time thinking this through and deciding if I could go or not, and ultimately I decided I'm not able to comfortably afford this trip-- The cruise is on school vacation week, it's a full week long, it leaves from Miami so flights are insane, and it's just not in my budget right now. Not to mention I am the only single person in the entire group, which meant I would have to pay for both spots in my room, so it's twice as expensive for me. And, a cruise would not ever be my first choice on how to spend my money, a full week at sea does not appeal to me at all-- the only reason I would have considered it is because it breaks my heart to miss out of a family trip, something we haven’t done since 2006. This trip has unfortunately turned into a full family vacation that was just not planned with me in mind, and I can't make it work. When I told my parents I couldn't go, they then offered to pay for my room, which at that point felt like an afterthought and like pity so I declined-- especially where they weren't paying for my little sisters room.

I have been really sad and frustrated about the entire situation, but I've accepted that the trip wasn't planned for me and I can join in on the next one hopefully. 

Fast forward to today where my parents asked me to drive 3.5 hours home to stay with their dogs for the week while they go on this trip. This stings! I know I was invited and I am choosing not to go, but the idea of sitting home with their dogs while they all enjoy a vacation feels so bad.

Because of that, my mom tried her best to be both a father figure and mother figure for me (which i respect and love her wholeheartedly).

72,1frwnff,"AITA for leaving a friend of a decade ""unread""?","Me and my friend are both females and we're the same age (20y), I'll call my friend Eve. We met in middle school and I wasn't a friendly kind of girl, I was the quiet one, so she approached me first and I'd always push her away 'till I made her cry, so I tried to change and be more open to her.

After almost 10 years being through ups and downs, we finally found our partners. I've been in a healthy relationship for 2 years and she's been in a relationship with her girlfriend for a year.

So when she came talking about this girl I was happy for her and told her to go for it, later on she told me the girl's name was Kay, and she told me that even though they were only starting to know each other they promised to not get with anybody else at that time. BUT one day Kay was out partying, and Eve was with us at a friend's house, later on she left Eve for day's 'till she confessed cheating on Eve that night. Eve was devastated and told me, and I told her that she didn't deserve it, and if Kay really hurt her they shouldn't be together, and she agreed.

Months passed and Eve came to me talking about a girl named Mira, and told me she's amazing, and I was happy for her, seeing her move on. Turns out Kay and Mira were the SAME PERSON, and she told her girlfriend that I said all that, so the girl never wanted to be in the same place as I, and I didn't know why, until Eve told me what happened. Why would she tell her how I felt when she hurt my friend when in fact she changed and I acknowledged it?

Months later I wasn't even hanging out with Eve 'cause of that situation, so I told Eve my concerns about our friendship, how I felt ashamed of what I did in the past, how I wanted to be in her life, how I was before and about our future with our partners. Eve completely shut off the possibility of me going to their new house, said that it was 'cause Mira didn't like me being there, unlike the other friends, mostly Mira's. I asked if it wasn't a bit harsh of her but Eve said that she didn't want to fight with me 'bout it, so I just sent an ""okay"" and never talked to her again.

I texted her girlfriend, asked for her forgiveness, told her 'bout everything, and that I should've never judged her. She's straight up rude, attacked me, calling me a horrible person and an even awful friend and that I shouldn't be in Eve's life. In the end I just said that it was funny how Eve just deliberately called her different names, almost as if she wanted to pass her off as a different person. Although she didn't accept my apology, I tried to end the conversation on good terms.

Since then I didn't text them both on anything. A few days ago Eve sent me an ""Hi, how are u?"" text and I didn't even visualize it.

We met in middle school and I wasn't a friendly kind of girl, I was the quiet one, so she approached me first and I'd always push her away 'till I made her cry, so I tried to change and be more open to her.

After almost 10 years being through ups and downs, we finally found our partners. I've been in a healthy relationship for 2 years and she's been in a relationship with her girlfriend for a year.

So when she came talking about this girl I was happy for her and told her to go for it, later on she told me the girl's name was Kay, and she told me that even though they were only starting to know each other they promised to not get with anybody else at that time. BUT one day Kay was out partying, and Eve was with us at a friend's house, later on she left Eve for day's 'till she confessed cheating on Eve that night. Eve was devastated and told me, and I told her that she didn't deserve it, and if Kay really hurt her they shouldn't be together, and she agreed.

Months passed and Eve came to me talking about a girl named Mira, and told me she's amazing, and I was happy for her, seeing her move on. Turns out Kay and Mira were the SAME PERSON, and she told her girlfriend that I said all that, so the girl never wanted to be in the same place as I, and I didn't know why, until Eve told me what happened. Why would she tell her how I felt when she hurt my friend when in fact she changed and I acknowledged it?

Months later I wasn't even hanging out with Eve 'cause of that situation, so I told Eve my concerns about our friendship, how I felt ashamed of what I did in the past, how I wanted to be in her life, how I was before and about our future with our partners. Eve completely shut off the possibility of me going to their new house, said that it was 'cause Mira didn't like me being there, unlike the other friends, mostly Mira's. I asked if it wasn't a bit harsh of her but Eve said that she didn't want to fight with me 'bout it, so I just sent an ""okay"" and never talked to her again.

I texted her girlfriend, asked for her forgiveness, told her 'bout everything, and that I should've never judged her. She's straight up rude, attacked me, calling me a horrible person and an even awful friend and that I shouldn't be in Eve's life. In the end I just said that it was funny how Eve just deliberately called her different names, almost as if she wanted to pass her off as a different person. Although she didn't accept my apology, I tried to end the conversation on good terms.

Since then I didn't text them both on anything. A few days ago Eve sent me an ""Hi, how are u?"" text and I didn't even visualize it.

73,1frwisf,AITA for not giving toilet paper to my roommate,"I (F25) and my roommate (F23) have been roommates for the past year in a 2 bed 1 bath. While living in our past apartment she would never help pay for household items such as paper towels, toilet paper, toothpaste etc. she would also use my shower stuff such as shampoo and conditioner. I’m not the confronting type so I never said much expect “since I bought toilet paper last time can you get it next” every now and then but not often. It’s something that’s always annoyed me about her but we just moved into a new apartment that is 2 bed 2 bath, so I figured I can hold off until we move into our new place since we wouldn’t have shared bathroom it wouldn’t be an issue anymore. We moved this week and today we went to Walmart to get some stuff. I picked up some toilet paper and said “you probably need some too” and she said she’ll get some at another store. I was a little confused because she doesn’t drive and we didn’t talk about going to a different store. After Walmart we get home and she asks to have a roll of toilet paper. I say no, since she has her own bathroom it doesn’t make sense for me to be buying her toilet paper. She got mad at me and said she is buying some tomorrow and it’s just one roll. I just told her she should have bought some at Walmart and went to my room. I was ranting about it to some other friends and they are spilt. Some think I should have just gave her a roll and others agree with me. I understand toilet paper is relatively cheap and giving her one roll wouldn’t have broke the bank, but I’ve been buying her toilet paper and other household items for the past year. We both make the same annually and she has less bills than me so I know it’s not a money issue for her. But I’m starting to feel a little bad for not giving her a roll lol. Am I the asshole for not giving my roommate toilet paper?

Edit: with past roommates I have done one of three things for house hold items 
1. We both buy our own household stuff and use our own stuff 
2. We can buy stuff together and just spilt the cost 50/50
3. We take turns buying stuff, ex: I buy it this time and you get it next time 

I asked her before she moved in which would she’d prefer because I don’t mind doing any of them. She said she would prefer the flip flop one 

For the first 2ish months of us living together we did that fine but over the months it just slowly became me buying everything. Other than the small reminders of “I bought it last time you get it this time” every now and then we haven’t had a conversation about it because I thought it would of been common sense she’d be buying stuff for her own bathroom. After reading some comments I can see how it might not of been so clear on her side so I’ll have a conversation with her tomorrow to make sure we are on the same page!

Long story short, he ended up going, and felt terrible about it. He said it felt dirty and also felt like he’s cheating, even though he’s was not in a relationship (he’s extremely emotional and gets attached easily).

75,1frwbmj,AITA for telling my brother to F**k off ?,"I (14F) know I am pretty young to be confiding in random people online, but I feel as if I have nobody else to share this with. I am the middle child ,and the only girl out of my two brothers (16 and 12) And as the only girl I was normally excluded a lot and grew up alone. So naturally I never wanted to share anything with any of my family. There's a reason for this, anytime i tried to explain my feelings to my mother she would tell me “shut the f\*\* up, i don’t care” or “i don’t wanna hear this right now” and if i ever did get her to listen enough for me to start explaining my feelings she would call me mental and tell me shes gonna take me to get a mental evaluation so i just never tried to speak to her anymore. I know some of you wonder how I grew up ‘alone’ with 2 brothers. Well my brother technically didn’t like me either. Anytime i tried to do anything with them they would call me “f\*\*king annoying” or tell me to “leave them alone” so i stopped trying. But that's not why I chose to write this post. Today my brothers were getting ready to go on a walk to a nearby pond so they could fish. I asked them if I could come with them. They told me “nobody wants you to come” I asked them why and they said “your annoying” i told them i was coming anyway” and they said “ if your coming along were not going anymore” and they told me to go “k\*ll myself, nobody cares about you””. I don’t know why I still tried to bond with them despite how they treat me. I guess I still care to have a relationship with them. But hearing them say that, just broke something in me. I went silent and walked away. I tried to not think about what he said but it stuck with me. I cried, A lot. And in that moment I chose to stop trying to bond with them. I chose to honor my peace and my feelings. I guess my brother heard me crying because 15 minutes later he asked me if I was ok. I told him to “f\*\*k off” and he called me a “b\*tch” and told me he was just trying to see if i was ok. I told him I didn't need him to check on me. He had just told me to k\*ll myself i didn’t want him to check if i was ok or not. Now I'm getting yelled at by my mother and grandparents telling me to stop being so mean to my brothers. I feel so neglected, I’m really starting to think I might be mental. I’m not sure if something is wrong with me , but the mind games they are playing are really making me feel so isolated. I feel like I have nobody. I’m not sure if I should just forgive my brother and move on. So AITA? P.s Sorry if this post seems rushed. I’m not trying to write a novel, I just wanted to vent.

77,1frw6j9,AITAH For leaving my kids with my ex wife and backpacking on the Appalachian Trail?,"The past few years have been the hardest of my (45m) life.  My marriage, which was never in good shape, took a bad turn about 6 years ago, but improved and we stayed together.  4 years ago my favorite aunt passed away from cancer.  3 years ago my closest friend and mentor passed away, also from cancer. 2 years ago my ex wife and I separated for the final time and I moved into a friend’s spare bedroom.  1 year ago, I was divorced, sold the house I’d lived in longer than anywhere ever, and 6 weeks later lost my job. A week after that I lost my uncle after a shockingly short battle with cancer.  

My uncle was one of my closest family members and also a sort of mentor to me that I really looked up to.  I took his death very hard.  

During most of my career, I worked a frustrating office job with high stress, because my ex wife had asked me to change my career path after I was deployed to Iraq in the Marine Corps.  I was in the first artillery battery into Iraq, was in firefights for days at a time, and returned home with PTSD. I had planned to be a police officer before enlisting largely because I hated the idea of being in a cube for 40 years. When I came home from overseas my wife begged me to do something safe.  I obliged, got out and went to school for business, and got the job I never wanted.  

I dreamed of being outside, and for the last few years have been dreaming of doing the Appalachian Trail. I could never figure out how to balance family, work, marriage and get the months off that it would take to do the whole thing.

My last 18 months at my job was tough.  My boss would pit us against each other to see who sank and who swam.  It was cut throat and fast paced. They changed my responsibilities multiple times to the point where I was no longer doing what I’d been hired to do and wasn’t in line with my skills at all. 

So I wasn’t bothered about losing that job, and frankly as I’d done it to appease the wife I no longer had I wasn’t sure that I wanted to go back to another job doing the same thing any way.  

I asked my parents to stay with my kids during the times I would have custody of them, and went backpacking for 5 1/2 weeks to clear my head and think about the next chapter.  My ex wife had agreed to swap one of the weekends of custody with me so I could go too.  

With everything that happened in the past 6 (but really 20+) years, I didn’t see how I could go on. I’ve been fighting so much for so long (more than described here) that life just didn’t seem worth living any more.   

Well, it turns out that my ex is irate that I’d get to go do something I enjoyed instead of plunging right back into another job.  I started looking for a job a few days after losing mine and kept it up while gone but my heart wasn’t in it. When I got home I decided I’m too old to change careers and don’t want to throw away the experience I’ve fought for, so I increased my search and have applied to hundreds and hundreds of jobs. I still haven’t found a job, but I’m at the final stage of interviews for a company I’m excited about. 

My family and many past friends blame my trip for me not having a job yet, and my ex wife is still pretty livid about it.

79,1frw29n,AITA for not letting my brother attend our family’s holiday because of his fiancée’s cultural beliefs?,"I (30F) any my brother (28M) has been dating his fiancée (26F) for about two years. She’s a great person - kind, smart, and loves him, but our families couldn’t be more different. Our family is laid back and loud, and our holiday celebration is the highlight of the year. It’s a big deal for us, with lots of food, drinks, dancing, and games. We go all out, and it’s the one time we all come together to have fun without judgment. But my brother’s fiancée comes from a conservative religious background with strict dietary and cultural rules. She doesn’t eat pork, shellfish, or anything non-halal. She also doesn’t drink alcohol or participate in dancing or games, which are core parts of our celebration.

Last year, she joined us for the first time, and it was uncomfortable. My mom made separate dishes without pork or shellfish, and we toned down the drinking, but she still seemed out of place. She didn’t eat much, didn’t engage in conversation, and spent most of the evening sitting quietly while we celebrated. My brother looked tense the entire time, and the vibe felt off, like we were walking on eggshells.

This year, my brother called me asking for more changes. He wants us to have a completely dry holiday—no alcohol, no pork, no shellfish, and to make the atmosphere “more respectful” by skipping the loud music and dancing. He said it’s about making her feel comfortable and included, and that it’s just one day, so why can’t we make the sacrifice? I told him while I respect her beliefs, this is our family tradition, and changing everything for one person isn’t fair to the rest of us. This holiday has been the same for decades, and it means a lot to us too.

He got upset, saying that by refusing, I was excluding them and being disrespectful. I reminded him that we already made compromises last year, but she still didn’t seem happy, so how far are we expected to go? I even suggested they do their own thing this year and we could catch up after, but he blew up, accusing me of pushing them out of the family. Now he’s threatening not to come at all, and it’s causing a major rift.

Some of our family members think we should just go along with the changes to keep the peace, while others agree with me that it’s unreasonable to ask everyone to completely overhaul our traditions for one person, especially when she doesn’t seem to want to meet us halfway. My mom is caught in the middle and just wants everyone to get along, but no matter what, someone is going to be upset.

Honestly, I don’t want to exclude my brother, but I also don’t want our holiday to feel like something it’s not. Why should we have to change our entire tradition? They knew what our family was like when they got together, and while I’m all for respecting different cultures, I think there has to be some compromise on both sides. My brother is making it seem like I’m being stubborn, but I think I’m just trying to protect something that’s important to us. So now tell me AITAH or NTA?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-29,"AITA for not letting my brother attend our family’s holiday because of his fiancée’s cultural beliefs? I (30F) any my brother (28M) has been dating his fiancée (26F) for about two years. She’s a great person - kind, smart, and loves him, but our families couldn’t be more different. Our family is laid back and loud, and our holiday celebration is the highlight of the year. It’s a big deal for us, with lots of food, drinks, dancing, and games. We go all out, and it’s the one time we all come together to have fun without judgment. But my brother’s fiancée comes from a conservative religious background with strict dietary and cultural rules. She doesn’t eat pork, shellfish, or anything non-halal. She also doesn’t drink alcohol or participate in dancing or games, which are core parts of our celebration.

Last year, she joined us for the first time, and it was uncomfortable. My mom made separate dishes without pork or shellfish, and we toned down the drinking, but she still seemed out of place. She didn’t eat much, didn’t engage in conversation, and spent most of the evening sitting quietly while we celebrated. My brother looked tense the entire time, and the vibe felt off, like we were walking on eggshells.

This year, my brother called me asking for more changes. He wants us to have a completely dry holiday—no alcohol, no pork, no shellfish, and to make the atmosphere “more respectful” by skipping the loud music and dancing. He said it’s about making her feel comfortable and included, and that it’s just one day, so why can’t we make the sacrifice? I told him while I respect her beliefs, this is our family tradition, and changing everything for one person isn’t fair to the rest of us. This holiday has been the same for decades, and it means a lot to us too.

He got upset, saying that by refusing, I was excluding them and being disrespectful. I reminded him that we already made compromises last year, but she still didn’t seem happy, so how far are we expected to go? I even suggested they do their own thing this year and we could catch up after, but he blew up, accusing me of pushing them out of the family. Now he’s threatening not to come at all, and it’s causing a major rift.

Some of our family members think we should just go along with the changes to keep the peace, while others agree with me that it’s unreasonable to ask everyone to completely overhaul our traditions for one person, especially when she doesn’t seem to want to meet us halfway. My mom is caught in the middle and just wants everyone to get along, but no matter what, someone is going to be upset.

Honestly, I don’t want to exclude my brother, but I also don’t want our holiday to feel like something it’s not. Why should we have to change our entire tradition?

80,1frvx43,AITA for not “just taking it” from my fiancee?,"hi everyone. so i (21f) have been engaged to my fiancee for two months now, dating for four years. I love her beyond anything else in this world, and a part of me feels guilty for writing this because I have the natural urge to want to defend her, but i need someone to give me their feedback. i feel so depressed, sad, lost. i’m really going through it and i don’t have anyone else to talk to about this. 

For starters, my fiancee and I have always had our “seasons”, which is what I like to call it. We’ll go a few weeks without hardly any arguing, it’s like we’re on absolute cloud nine with each other. and then something happens overnight and we switch to arguing everyday / every other day for a few weeks. and it’ll just keep flipping and flopping and it’s been that way for our entire relationship. I’ve asked her several times to either a) maybe she seeks out therapy, even if just for a few times. or b) we go to couples therapy TOGETHER. she gets absolutely offended by it, telling me “that’s fucking stupid” and that i’m so rude for even saying that. But, i myself see a therapist every once in a while for my own personal health reasons; and during arguments, she’ll frequently throw at my face “you need help. you should seriously start seeing your therapist again because you are not okay.” even though the entire argument started because of her treating me horrible and all i did was react. 

fast forward to a few weeks *before* she proposes to me: we’re doing really good, like REALLY good. there’s been no arguments besides your occasional getting annoyed w each other. she was putting in EXTRA effort to give me love (i’m a *huge* physical touch person, that’s something that i just need to feel loved), she was doing all the right things… and I had a feeling that she was going to propose soon and I wanted to do the right thing by sitting her down and having a pretty serious talk; I basically said that, just out of doing what’s best for both of us, i don’t think she should propose until she’s absolutely sure we’re headed a good direction and she can provide me with the treatment i deserve PERMANENTLY, not something that’s conditional and comes and goes with the weather. so, im not sure if she was just faking it until she put the ring on my finger or if she was genuinely just trying to be better, but it was great in the moment. and then she proposes and literally, everything just plummets. It’s like our entire relationship flatlines. Her love is gone, her affection is gone, her touch is gone. she’s getting mad at me for EVERY little thing. our arguments are never small, always big and always so damn hurtful. and to make things worse, she **never** apologizes. she **never** takes accountability. ever. 

Just for an example, we’ve been arguing all week this week. Mostly because she’s getting upset with me for the smallest reasons and blowing it completely out of proportion. she wakes up before me for work and USUALLY she would give me kisses and hugs and lay with me for a bit before she got up and left for work, it’s our little routine that does a LOT to make me feel loved and cared for. this week? nothing. she gets up, gets ready for work and just… leaves. no “goodbye”, no kiss, not even a look my way. i’ve woken up alone everyday this week. And at night, she’s been either sleeping on the floor of our bedroom OR she’s shoving a pillow between us on the bed. it breaks my heart. tonight, i got in bed after doing my own thing because she’s pissed at me AGAIN, and she tugged her pillow at a weird angle and had it somewhat shoved between us. i thought she was trying to put it between us again (because she’s been doing it all week), so i was trying to be helpful and tried pulling it further down as to avoid her getting even more mad. she yells at me “dude you are so fucking annoying”, in which i told her i thought she was trying to put it between us. she gives me the dirtiest look like im the worst thing ever, yanks the pillow and slams it onto the floor, yanks the blanket off the bed and lies on the floor. i don’t say anything, i don’t make any faces, i just try to keep quiet to avoid escalation. 5 mins later, she sits up and says “are you gonna stop being fucking childish”, i say “i’d like to just be left alone right now please”, and then she laughs and says “you know, if you don’t want to fucking be with me, you can just tell me.”. And now here i am, crying and writing this. she also started breaking me down for being in the shower for 45 mins, saying i “clearly just want to keep arguing” and “i don’t love her”, when in reality, i was sitting in the shower sobbing, having a full on anxiety attack. 

I feel stuck between “i love her. we have our good moments and when it’s good, it’s great. she proposed to me and we’re so close to getting our first home together.” and “i don’t deserve this. it’s been four years and she still hasn’t changed. i can’t take this anymore”. i don’t know what the right choice to make is.

An acquaintance of mine started a small ladies group.  Purpose of group is basically social: we get together and go out to a restaurant to eat  and ” catch up”.    I  am ok with this and have been participating, however, we keep going to the same place every  month.  Ironically, this is the acquaintances favorite place, because they like to eat a particular dessert item on the menu there.

82,1frvvrr,AITA for telling my daughter her dreams aren’t real and making her cry?,"Over the past couple months, my (49M) daughter (16F) has been getting bad dreams. This happens to everybody, but she will wake up and be visibly upset, and if the dream is about us there will be a discussion.

For example, last week she had a bad dream that involved my wife and I. Her dream was supposedly us yelling at her. Initially we told her that it’s just a dream and not to worry, as we have never yelled at her. She then started going on about childhood trauma and expressing emotions. I didn’t argue, but instead just sat there and listened. I assured her that we are always there for her and she doesn’t need to hesistate if she needs to let us know about something, no matter what it is (this is what I always have said during each of these discussions). 

Before that, apparently she had a dream that her boyfriend was cheating on her, which led her to yell at her boyfriend the next day, and another discussion. I asked if there was any reason that would lead her to believe he was cheating, to which she said no but is feeling paranoid. She later apologized to us and her boyfriend.

Most of the time, there will be a lenghty discussion and then she will apologize later that day. However, today was a bit of a tipping point for me. Perhaps I didn’t need to be so blunt, but she had another bad dream, and this time I told her that her dreams mean nothing, and each time she wakes up she needs to move on.

83,1frvqzn,AITA for wanting to go no communication with my soon to be ex-roommate? ,"So me, a 25m who is autistic adhd, and my roommate, who is a 25f, have been living together for just over a year now. Everything started out great. We had a 3rd roommate, and we all worked the same job and had similar hours, so it fit perfectly, as the 2nd one doesn't have a car. This went well for about a month. The 3rd roommate lost their job, and then lied about trying to find one for a month and a half and ended up leaving without saying anything or helping with rent. We dealt with that as the apartment itself started breaking down. The shower flooded, the kitchen sink/dishwasher stopped working snd backedup. Our heatingac went out downstairs. Me and the roommate then spent months going back and forth with the apartment complex over the repairs needed. They never got fixed and got to the poijt we had no hot water, no working kitchen/bathroom, and our backdoor was falling off. We ended up leaving and partners parents took us in as we had nowhere else to go. All our finances went to bills and apartments applications. I lost my job, and so my partner has been helping with my car.

Now, me and this roommate have been best friends through it all. They've met my siblings, my partner, my best friend. Even came for my dnd game a few times. We worked together in an environment that had very rough nights. We had each other through it. We've even helped each other through bad nights at our house. 

The problem i have with my roommate now is that she has stopped talking to me completely and has made plans to move out without even talking to me. This started slowly. She had closed off a bit when we moved in, we both had. We were both uncomfortable being in my partners parents house. Not that we didn't appreciate it or didn't love them, but it wasn't our home, we were guests. I kept up with asking if i can help with anything, i talked to her every day, like we usually do, but things started to change. Her responses became smaller, dryer, and just not as really interested. She stopped going to work, and just became reclusive in her room.I tried talking to her about this, and she had told me that depression has really taken a hold. I asked if there was anything i can do, and offered to help eith some things. I thought this would at least help get out of the funk we were both in. At least thats how it felt. She said she'd try but just wanted a day or two to kind of adjust and sleep. But it didn't stop.

We've now been at my partners parents house for 2.5 months. Throughout these past 2 months, she only went to work about a handful of times. Maybe a week in total. My partners parents knew something was up, but didn't want to pry because were all adults and they dont want to baby anyone. Me and my partner tried talking to her, helping her with things likd cooking, laundry, i even left my car here for her every day because i didn't want to leave her without a way around while i only went anywhere with my partner. She ended up being fired for not going to work, the litter has begun to smell and she now has been going out during the day and soending the night places, leaving the cats here alone all night and some of the day, ahe hasn't spoken to me in like a week, and when she does speak to me its short, sometimes passive aggressive, and just not caring. Throughout the first month and a half i tried talking to her everyday, tried inviting her to join us in the house or even in outings we had. She declined every time and started responding with short ""im fine"" or ""im alright"". This became mentally taxing. 

She hasn't spoken to the parents hardly since moving in, she doesnt clean anything, doesn't come out to eat anymore.

84,1frvq8s,AITA for trading in my mom’s phone? ,"I (24 girl) recently got the newest iPhone because well, I get a new phone every 5 years. Before that, I previously had the iPhone 11 which my mom gave to me after I broke my old one. I opted for the trade in because well save money but there is WAAAAY more context to this so do sit tight.

My mom hasn’t spoken to me in months for literally bc I forgot to tell her I was coming home late. The night it happened, I literally called saying I’m sorry I forgot to text you, I didn’t plan on being out late, but I’m on my way home. I think it was like 11? 

Anyways, she locked me out of the house and  told me that I intentionally forgot because I remembered last time and then just hasn’t spoken to me since. This is basically the dynamic of our relationship because I don’t have the energy to fight her anymore as my mom is generally an asshole to me. 

Examples:
- sold my childhood memories on eBay

- kicked me out once because my dad forgot to tell her I had a friend over
- made me drink vinegar and eat raw garlic as a kid
- screamed at me for talking to my now ex outside bc my dog was barking

My mom’s also made a bunch of empty promises to me. When I started college we had a deal that she would reimburse me for my semester every time I passed (she had no hope for me). Come the end of my freshman year, I had apparently won a scholarship. She opened my mail without telling me. And said that because I won, she wouldn’t give me money for that year because that’s double dipping. 

I’m honestly still upset about this because that was like $2k and I busted my ass off both in school and picking up extra shifts to make sure I could pay for everything. I’m still upset about this, the childhood memories being sold (she never replaced anything, apologized, or gave me the profits she made out of my few happy memories)

I only got upset about it all over again because she talked through my dad to ask for her phone back if I’m not using it. But I’m very over her bullshit and yes, I know this is petty of me, but every now and then I get really tired of being the adult and parenting my own parents.

I would move out if I could, but I live in Cali and well, average rent is like 2,500 in my area and my moving out plans got fucked when my ex and I ended things. ",Asshole,2024-09-29,"AITA for trading in my mom’s phone?  I (24 girl) recently got the newest iPhone because well, I get a new phone every 5 years. Before that, I previously had the iPhone 11 which my mom gave to me after I broke my old one. I opted for the trade in because well save money but there is WAAAAY more context to this so do sit tight.

My mom hasn’t spoken to me in months for literally bc I forgot to tell her I was coming home late. The night it happened, I literally called saying I’m sorry I forgot to text you, I didn’t plan on being out late, but I’m on my way home. I think it was like 11? 

Anyways, she locked me out of the house and  told me that I intentionally forgot because I remembered last time and then just hasn’t spoken to me since. This is basically the dynamic of our relationship because I don’t have the energy to fight her anymore as my mom is generally an asshole to me.

- sold my childhood memories on eBay 
- cut up my old jerseys and used them as kitchen rags without telling me

85,1frvq58,AITA for planning to serve alcohol at my wedding?,"I (30F) and my fiance (33M) are getting married in about three months. We have been together for 4 years. I am ex-Mormon. I was born into the church and participated until I was 25. There was a big blow up with my family when I left. My older brother was supportive, but my sister and my mom were very unhappy and blamed me for ruining their “eternal families.” My dad died when I was a teenager, so who knows what he thinks about it lol.

When we were planning the wedding, we were really thoughtful about the issue of alcohol, since most of our friends and my fiance’s family like to drink and my entire family does not drink at all. We decided on a bar with personalized cocktails for both of us, with fun mocktails for nondrinkers or designated drivers. The bar also has sodas, sparkling waters, and nonalcoholic beer and wine. Each attendee gets two free drink tokens. My family (and the other nondrinkers) can still have a fun drink while not having alcohol, and everyone who wants to drink will be able to. With the drink tokens, we avoid the ""open bar"" overindulgence.

So two days ago, my mom decided to call our venue about the menu. She did not tell me she was doing this and I still don't know why. Anyway, she found out that we were serving alcohol at the wedding and called me absolutely freaking out. She wouldn’t stop saying that we were encouraging ""wickedness"" and it was ""against her morals."" I told her that there were nonalcoholic options for anyone who wanted them, but she countered that I was planning on “corrupting” my nieces and nephews by having them around “drunks.” I was trying *so hard* to stay calm. She kept interrupting me and yelling, and I finally snapped and told her that if this was such a problem for her, then she should not come to the wedding. She hung up on me and now I’m getting texts from two of my aunts and my sister saying that I am a huge jerk for serving alcohol and I should have told them so they could have declined their invitations. 

I talked to my brother, and while he thinks they are overreacting, he does say that I should have warned them about the alcohol, since they probably haven’t been to a non-Mormon wedding before and didn’t know that alcohol would probably be served. He said that he was fine with his kids coming to the wedding and that he and his family would be there, but my mom, sister and her family, aunts and uncles, and grandparents are all saying they won’t attend now.

I honestly thought that the options we provided were suitable for my family's morals. My fiance is totally on my side and says that if this is the thing that’s going to stop them from coming to the wedding, then they didn’t care about it that much anyway, so good riddance. He means well and is trying to be supportive and has been a great shoulder to cry on while this has been happening.

86,1frvh9w,WIBTAH if I give my dad a time out after what he did at my wedding ,"I (47f) have never been married (until two weeks ago).  My parents have been divorced since I was 17.

At that time my younger sibling and I lived with my dad.  I did everything but cook dinner to make things easier for him.  He has always trash talked my mom, sometimes I felt like I was the adult and my parents were the children.
In the early years of the divorce I was responsible beyond my years, but wanted everyone to be okay.

I moved to the city at 24 and took care of myself, while always giving grace to both of my parents for things over the years that were selfish.

I’ve always tried to be a good daughter, although I’ve also had my moments where I could have done better.

Fast forward a lot of years… I start dating someone from my hometown that I have known since grade one, and our families all know each other.  He is the sweetest man ever and we get engaged…. Then plan a wedding.  Knowing my parents are not friends I plan everything so they have buffer space except for the ceremony.  

Since my dad is walking me down the aisle him and my stepmom need to be seats 1&2 on my side and then I want my mom and stepdad to be 3&4.  Remember this is only for the ceremony, the reception they are across the room from each other.  And for more context at this point they are divorced for 30 yrs and both have been remarried for 25 and 18.

The problem comes when my mom isn’t sitting where she should be.  
I found out this week my now MIL (she is the best and i know i am blessed) tried to correct the problem and tell my uncle and cousin they were sitting in my mom’s seat.  Turns out my dad told them to sit there because he didn’t want to be next to my mom.  Really WTF for 30 minutes and his wife would be next to my mom and there isn’t small talk expected during the ceremony.

I feel like his distaste for my mom was more important than me and my feelings.  I wasn’t asking for much and why didn’t he move down the row if it bothered him?  He didn’t have the right to move my mom’s seat.  Again I am grown and we paid for the wedding ourselves… so I feel it was inappropriate for him to change things without even talking to me about it.

Would I be the asshole if I need space from my dad?  I still haven’t figured out how I feel about the future, but right now I am so disappointed and upset that he did that on a once in a lifetime day that I can’t even think about talking to him, because I know it will be a pile of excuses and how I should have known or some other bullshit.

87,1frvgry,AITA for asking my friend to tell me if there's gonna be alcohol at the function?,"On mobile sry. Also throwaway since some of these people are on reddit.

I (24f) do not drink, I have a lot of trauma from my alcoholic father and I know addiction runs in my family so I don't drink.

I have some issues being around alcohol, mostly if its with people I don't know or if I'm not aware of it. Usually this is fine, I usually ask beforehand if there will be alcohol/what is the expected outcome of consuming the alcohol? Like if people are there to get sloshed, I don't want to be there and I will exclude myself, I never want to try to control my friends, I just prefer if they're going to be super drunk, that I don't participate in the activity.

Tonight, my best friend's (24m) friend (30m) hosted a game night. We had done game nights before, but he hadn't hosted but every other game night had been sober so I assumed this one would be too.

I got there late because of work, and there were way more people than I expected and they were all drinking. The host kept offering me alcohol throughout the night and I kept politely saying ""no thank you, I don't drink."" 

The games went well for a while, until my friend started feeling sick and then game night ended. I drove my friend home and he threw up on the sidewalk outside his house.

I texted my friend after I got home telling him I hope he felt better and that if I could do anything to let me know, but also if next time he could let me know if there is going to be that much alcohol consumed at an event. 

He texted back saying that theyre all adults and adults drink and just because Im sober doesnt mean everyone else has to be. And I tried to explain that I just felt uncomfortable walking into an environment where I didn't know the people and I didnt know there'd be that much drinking. And I said I really didnt like how his friend kept asking me if I wanted a drink no matter how many times I said no.

He said that he likes hanging out with me and that his friend's friends all found me cool but he wished I could ""loosen up"" and stop ""worrying so much"" about stuff like this and that sometimes I can be a real buzzkill. He also said that his friend was just trying to be a good host so that's why he kept asking me if I wanted a drink.

Previously, he has told me when alcohol is involved or if he'll check to see if nonalcoholic options are available for me, he is aware of my history with alcohol and usually accommodates me so I dont know why tonight was so different.

Maybe I am the asshole and hes now just realizing he doesn't need to accommodate my feelings? Im worried that since this is the drunkest I have seen my friend that thats why he is responding so aggressively and that he does find me annoying that I don't drink.

I dont know. I feel like Im not being unreasonable but adults do drink and I should probably get used to it.

In the same text I asked my friend if his other friend still wanted to go and if so that I would add the amount for the ticket on splitser (expenses app) and he could figure it out with his friend. He replied with ‘yeah’. And I sent over all the tickets in the group chat.

I went to bed early that night given that I was ill and the next morning I saw a text in our groupchat sent at 12:30 am ‘lol my friend apparently does not want to go. He already had other plans’

From this text in the groupchat he felt it was my responsibility to sell the ticket, whereas I felt like it was his fault he had bad communication with his friend.

Even worse was the fact that on Friday when I texted to confirm tickets were wanted and were sold for 130, original price 100 and I sold it to his friend for 100 and the morning after (due to bad weather) ticket were only sold for 60.

93,1fruhti,AITA for not expecting elves to suffer from male pattern baldness? ,"Sorry in advance because this is kind of a weird one, and not very high stakes. Also English is my second language so sorry if there are any mistakes. 

Me 22F and a few friends (all early 20s M/F) were chatting the other day and I forget why, but the conversation topic went to Tolkien and Lord of the Rings — which we are all fans of to various levels. 

Necessary trivia: elves in Tolkien are generally ""aesthetically perfect"", ethereally beautiful, you know the deal.. 

Now, if you haven't seen the LOTR movies, there's this elf who has a really noticeably receding hairline, like widows peak in reverse, and its very noticeable becsuse LOTR elves hairstyle is long swept back hair, and the camera zooms in wide on the guy's face a lot so there's no missing it. And I mentioned during the conversation that when I first watched the movies years ago I found it really funny that they let this elf keep his crazy hairline because you'd not expect an elf to suffer from male pattern baldness. I didn't say he was ugly or anything, just that it was unexpected/amusing. 

A guy in the group, Jake has the beginnings of male pattern baldness, very slight BTW. Not really noticeable at all unless you look for it, but I of course understand he may be feeling insecure about it. Anyway Jake lashed out at me for this comment, called me shallow and ""vapid"" and that judgemental people like me are the reason for male loneliness. I told him it wasn't that I thought a receding hairline was a horrible nightmarish thing, but that it was an unexpected choice when it came to casting a species that's meant to be the pinnacle of human perfection, not because I hate balding people but because that specific elf's specific hairline isn't what you'd call conventionally attractive. Didn't say it's good or bad, just that I found it funny at the time. 

Jake blocked me off everything and is posting a ton of subtweets about not making fun of things people can't change. I repeat I said this about the elf, and not a comment on baldness itself. I meant well but he's so annoyed that I am not questioning whether I'm in the wrong and don't realise because I am not a man or balding myself. 

 I did apologize, BTW and said I only intended to say it about the elf but he's just not having it. AITA?

Two days ago I was in my room and I heard a commotion in the bathroom. Both my house mates were in there and one of them sounded like they were in great distress. The door opened and one of them yelled for me to call an ambulance which I immediately did. 

The ambulance arrived within five minutes and one of them was stretchered out and the other was going to the hospital with her to provide support. I still did not know what was going on.

After they had gone I went into the empty bathroom and  realised the nature of the problem. There was a large amount of blood in and around the the toilet, on floor and even some on the wall and around the sink and bathtub.

Thinking I was doing a good thing I flushed the toilet and proceeded to bleach and clean everything until the bathroom was spotless.

The housemate that went in support came home late at night. She then told me that our other housemate had had a miscarriage and was okay, but was being kept overnight for observation. She noticed I had cleaned the bathroom and thanked me as she assumed it was something she would have to do when she got home.

Yesterday afternoon the other housemate came home and immediately went to the bathroom. She began screaming and yelling, asking who had flushed the toilet.

One of my friends suggested I post here to see if AITA and I didn't see any harm in it, so here's my situation. Ps. Please keep in mind that the majority of my siblings are half siblings, which is why some are very close in age. 

For starters, I (18m) was raised in a fucked up household. My parents constantly fought, are heavy drinkers and smokers to this day, and both have many affair kids and counting. We weren't beaten but were verbally, emotionally, and financially abused. It sucked. Everyone walked on eggshells around our parents, and the house always felt tense. 

Anyway, since I could remember, my older brothers and sisters had a tradition of leaving and never looking back. 

The fates of my siblings are a mixed bunch. My 33f sister is a druggie, my 31f sister is a married nurse, my 30m brother is in the Navy, my 29f sister is in jail, and my 27m brother is in the Army. As for my 24f sister and 21m brother, I don't know. They both completely cut contact after they left home. 

Last year, my 19m brother left for Marine Boot camp just a few weeks after his 18th birthday, and I plan to do the same. I want out, I'm currently the eldest kid at home, and I hate it. Most of the cooking and cleaning are left to me, I drop-off/pick-up my younger siblings from school every day as my parents won't take them. I have a part-time job, but my parents take about 70% of my paycheck for 'rent' and constantly threaten to kick me out. 

I'm done, I can't stand living here anymore. I'm surprised I stayed for as long as I did. The only thing I feel bad about is leaving my younger siblings, 16m&f twins, 14m, 10f, 6f, and 3m.

My dad didn't even care when I told him I'm leaving for boot camp, but my mom screamed, berated, and even threw a lamp at me, but I managed to move out of the way just in time. I don't really care about my parents. They can rot in hell. But I feel guilty that I'm about to leave my siblings to deal with them on their own.

I voted for her to be nominated then we went back to class. 10 mi later two other girls and I found out we got nominated for homecoming queen and she wasn't one of them. About 2 hours later at the end of class she came in and said ""Hey can we talk?"" and I said ""Yeah."" Then we went out the door to talk to her and she was just going on and on about how she wanted it. Then when she stopped I said then said, “ I voted for you there's nothing I can do.” she said  ""Well, someone needs to drop out or something."" and stormed off. Then she left the second class period she left and went home. Like 2 days later she was talking about me and the other two girls that got nominated saying “They didn’t vote me in because they knew I would win.” Then at the end of that week, I find out she asked my crush to homecoming. I was so upset. Then I texted her and said ""This shouldn't be just a break."" and she agreed and we started arguing and she started saying that I should have dropped out of the running for homecoming queen so she could have it. Then she admitted that she only asked my crush to homecoming because ""It would hurt me just as much as ​I hurt her"" then I just stopped texting her and I unadded her. We haven't talked since.

102,1frsq88,AITA for asking my ex to pay the movers?,"I (32f) and my ex (28m) just split. We were together for a year and a half and had some real highs and lows. Recently, our conflicts seemed nonstop- I was miserable and I'm sure he was too. Our breakup was mutual. We agreed to break our lease, split the penalty evenly, etc.

When we discussed the move, he said his friends and family would help him. I said I was hiring movers for my stuff. He offered to help carry things downstairs for me so I could save money. That didn't seem fair to him, so I declined. He planned to move in the morning and be gone by the time the movers arrived. However, when I arrived with the movers, he wasn’t there but some of his stuff was including a big couch.

Earlier that week, I moved all my small stuff out and only left the big stuff for the movers since they cost $185 per hour. They load everything, I lock the door, and we are all on the street about to leave when my ex shows up. He asks if the movers will move his couch downstairs. At first, I said no and explained that we were finished and about to leave. But then I saw he didn’t have friends with him and his dad has a broken collarbone.

So, I immediately changed my mind and asked the movers if they would move the couch, and I said that I’d make sure it was reflected in the tip. My ex walked away and didn’t hear this. The movers said yes (reluctantly) and moved it.

107,1frry1d,AITA for not giving my flatmate any lasagne?,"I(21F) have lived with my flatmates Sage(21F), Garret(20M) and Lewis(22M) in our uni flat for a year now.

Garret recently called a flat meeting. Well, he told Lewis he wanted one, Lewis told me and then out of fear and anxiety, I initiated it. It was about last year. The unequal chores, the ""rift"" between us, and the hypocrisy.

Within our tenancy last year, Sage and I did all the work around the flat. Sage meal planned, I cooked, and we did all the cleaning. At the beginning of the year, we agreed to share the chores and cook together when we could. Once in a blue moon, they would clean or wash up. If Garret washed up, it would have to be done again because of a greasy layer every time. It became expected of us to do the work. We did the shopping because they refused. Both ended up owing around £50 each to Sage and I. 

Sage fell ill and couldn't eat most foods. I stopped cooking because she was the only one helping me. When she could eat more after five months, we began cooking together but not for the others. Occasionally we'd offer a portion to them. We were still the only ones cleaning. I reached my lowest from the mental load of uni work and flat upkeep and just stopped doing what wasn't mine or Sage's

We attempted to communicate but were met with attitude. We didn't try harder because I'm scared of Garret. Once, he banged on the wall and stomped to his door because I asked him to be quieter after 23:00. I ran to lock my door. He banged on it saying he was joking.

In the flat meeting, Garret apologised for making conversations about himself. There was nothing about the banging on walls or the lack of help. Sage and I were called hypocrites for not asking for help cleaning/cooking. I mentioned that we had a chat for meal planning/recipes. They said it was a pain to access/they would forget about it. Garret blamed his attitude and actions on his suspected ADHD. He said he's changed and self-reflecting. Sage and I were made to feel guilty for our actions last year. I proposed we cook together again, to start the ""new year"" off well. I suggested lasagne and everyone agreed.  

Lewis chopped veg with me, I cooked the rest and Sage washed up during/after cooking. Garret said he was sick. I served up to Sage and Lewis. Garret messaged saying he'd pick up a portion later. I told him that because he didn't help/pay he didn't have a portion to pick up. He apologised for the misunderstanding and was quiet until I bumped into him in the kitchen later. I could feel the tension so I said hoped he wasn't upset about the lasagne. He snapped that it wasn't fair that if someone is sick they don't get to eat with everyone. I argued that when Sage was sick, no one cooked for her. That when I cooked last year I got no help and I wanted to set boundaries. He has been cold and short with me ever since.

I could be blowing this out of proportion. I could have done the good thing and given him a portion because he was sick.

He said the game was about to start, and I said “I asked you if we could watch this 2hrs ago and you said we could ‘in a bit’ and then didn’t bring it up?” He kinda dismissed me and said “it’s fine” but I knew it wasn’t fine. I pressed him to talk to me because that passive attitude just really triggers me. 

He said something along the lines of “I know that as the husband to a pregnant wife, when my wants get usurped I have to just deal with it” and THAT really set me off. At that point my tone got aggressive and I said something to the effect of “you had two hours to tell me we could watch the show, said nothing, and NOW when I want to watch it you’re gonna have this shitty attitude with me? Because YOU forgot? And I have to sit through a 4hr football game now??” (I don’t know how long  football game actually is but it feels that long). 

After that we watched the entire episode (it was a season finale) and he was silent the entire time. I was getting more and more mad as I was trying to act normal but he was just sitting there like a wet blanket. When it was over he said nothing and I was so mad I just went upstairs and it’s been 4hrs now. I expected him to come upstairs at some point to make up, nothing. 

So I’ve just gone downstairs now to try to makeup, I’ve asked him if he’s going to ignore me all day, and he’s said “do you want to talk?” To which I replied “well, I’m down here and I’m talking to you.” To which he replied “what do you want to talk about?” And that just got me so mad all over again. I feel like he’s being completely dismissive and apathetic. It really REALLY irks me. But I don’t know if it’s hormones either. AITA?


Edit: wow.  Well first off, no I did not purposely wait until 10min before the game to ask about the show. I asked 2hrs before, he said “in a bit” and then said nothing. 

Secondly, I can’t believe the amount of comments mentioning divorce and being single. You guys are really miserable if you think this little tiff with my husband is indicative of either of us becoming unfit parents or divorcing. Jesus Christ. I knew this sub was brutal, but WOW!

I have a pretty good relationship with my dad, he always calls me and checks in on my, asks me how i'm doing or how school is going (i am 16). I can talk to my dad about anything. 

However it is not like that with my mom. Whenever i try and talk to my mom about how I'm feeling she flips out on me, threatens to take all my stuff, and guilt trips me. She always says things like ""Why are you doing this to me"" ""Where did i go wrong as a mom"" just stuff like that. I got diagnosed with depression when i was 13 (my mom also has depression + bipolar disorder) but my depression is why sometimes I just need someone to talk to about how I am feeling. But my mom just doesn't listen and has a complete outburst just when i try to tell her how i'm feeling mentally. Whenever she threatens to take my stuff, she claims that the reason i am upset is because of ""my phone"" (like all parents do) However i'm not on my phone a lot, and it has no correlation. She'll threaten to smash my phone, or get rid of it. I've explained to her that it is not because of my phone. 

Since i got diagnosed with depression, whenever i have depressive episodes i tend to isolate myself in my room and not really talk to anyone. Whenever she notices this she flips out and does the exact same things. I've told her it's because of my depression multiple times and she still continues to yell and do those things. Instead of coming in and having a talk with me about it. I feel like she doesn't even care. I can't go to her when i'm feeling sad, and i can't even stay in my comfort place without her having an outburst either. Whenever my dad notices i'm in my room a lot he comes in and we have a talk about it, he listens and helps me. 

Whenever i try to do things to cheer myself up like chat with a friend for a little or maybe play a game, she says ""if you're upset you shouldn't be doing those things"" So even when i try and make myself happy by doing things i once enjoyed, she still gets mad. It's so exhausting and I really don't know what i am doing wrong, i just want to be able to talk to my mom, i just want her to care. I know parents get mad over dumb stuff sometimes and blame it on phones and all that but it is constantly, she screams at me for it, she guilt trips me and just threatens me all because i want to talk to her about how im doing. I can't even talk to her about how im feeling. I'm so tired of having everything i do make her mad. I don't understand. If she would just come in and talk with me about why i'm in my room or stuff like that I would be able to feel comfortable not isolating myself so much. but she doesn't do that's.

112,1fsgwnj,AITA for not inviting my friend for a drink on my birthday ,"Far less intense than other posts on here but i seriously need a outsider opinion on if im actually in the wrong here 

About a month out from my birthday i had asked my group of friends to see me on my birthday go to out clubbing, nothing was ever mentioned of it again, about a week out i had told everyone not to worry about it because i was too busy over the weekend to actually do that and not to worry about it as i had told everyone much going on 

Day of my birthday i saw a friend for (2) hours helped her get ready then we went for 1 drink which i also invited her boyfriend too ( me and her boyfriend are already friends and it was polite to ask as opposed to us leaving and him staying home alone ) 

A girl from the group saw we were together and sent me a paragraph about her being upset that she wasn’t invited, i let her know that it was 1 drink and also my friend had planned to do this with me and it was also only maybe about 45 minutes of us actually out and about, it wasn’t a “ lets not invite her “ situation it was just a simple “ lets go get a drink because its my birthday “ 

She has since gone on to berate me about being weird and dismissive of her feelings as i told her its actually not that big of a deal that she wasn’t invited to 1 drink on my birthday, i also told her that her initial paragraph she went me complaining about not being invited was passive aggressive, a bit entitled and overall not very necessary to send to me on my birthday ( which i already struggle to enjoy )

I feel like its important to note that the friend complaining about not being invited doesn’t regularly talk to me / see me, often spends time withe everyone else but me ( which i have no problem in ) and whenever we do see each other she is often hours late / forgets entirety 

She tried to arrange to see me another day which i let her know would be difficult as a work 6 days a week, i wake up early and get home late, and the 1 day i have off i usually have to do all my errands so time is tight for me at the moment 
( she works as a influencer as opposed to me working at a clock in/clock out job ) 

Someone let me know if im in the wrong because i really do not think it is as serious as she is making it out to be

113,1fsgus1,WIBTA if I called my brother in-law a hypocrite?,"I, 17M live with my two sisters. One of them are married and her husband also lives with us.

Since my parents went abroad for work last year, I took on a lot of responsibilities that most kids my age do not really have to worry about. I cook my own meals, do my own laundry, commute to school.

Sometimes I slack a bit. I forget to wash a tray or a pan here or there and I forget to move my laundry from the washer to the drier or from the drier back to my room. Most of the time, I like to think that I stay on top of things. 

When I do forget to do one of the chores listed above though, my brother in-law gets mad. He once lost it at me because I was washing some meat before cooking and apparently, a tiny piece of fat fell off it and got caught in the drain. When he yelled at me to come down and see, I saw it was so small so to me, it seemed reasonable why I never noticed it. Later that day, I was washing the dog when water came up the drain. Washing the dog isn’t a chore I usually do so I wasn’t aware of this but the reason the water flowed up is because they have a routine of removing the drain every few weeks and removing any clumps of dog fur. When this happened and I was oblivious to the fact I needed to remove the drain, brother in-law stormed in, barged past me and swore. This happened when I was sixteen. I am eighteen in a week. I would also like to preface he isn’t exactly a saint either. Sometimes he forgets to clean after himself and when he leaves dishes in the sink, sometimes they still have food on which clogs the drain. I have cleaned up after him and never complained and he’s older than me. He hasn’t behaved like that much since then but recently, he’s been acting up again. I’ve had a cold since last Wednesday. In that time, I’ve forgotten to clean out the air frier. Whenever I use it, I always clean it but just because I was sick, I genuinely didn’t have the energy to do more than essentials like eating or sleeping, like one does when they’re poorly. He made a comment about how ‘Every time’ he wants to use it, it’s dirty even though I know I never forget to clean that particular appliance. The next day, I used the air frier to make food. I’d just sat down to eat and even though I was sick, I planned to clean it after eating. He made a comment about me being lazy and not wanting to clean up after myself and continued so I just decided to stop eating to clean it just so he’d shush. Today, I went to make food in the oven. I opened it to take out a tray to see they were all dirty. I know I didn’t leave them dirty as I’ve not used it to cook in a while. I cleaned one to eat but because I’m sick, I didn’t want to clean up for others. Brother in-law got mad, saying I still should’ve cleaned it up since he’s always doing things for everyone else.

I'm studying in Europe, and I'm coursing an optional career about electricity and maintenance. I started studying in a different school than last year, but I know 7/25 of my classmates. For context, I don't have a good relation with any of them. They didn't bully me, but I know for a fact that I was nobody's first option, neither second or third. I like anime, videogames, and reading light novels, and I'm not going to change because of what other people think about me. 

The problem started this Thursday in class. The teacher told us that we have to do a summary of the first unit. Then, I pulled out a summary that I have done before, and all of my classmates started making fun of me, telling me that I should try to go outside and touch some grass, some of them even told me in the middle of class that I should try alcohol and other substances. I ignored them, and handed the summary to the teacher. He said that it was okay. 

Fast forward to last hour on the same day, I have another teacher, and after class, she tells me that she wants to speak with me. 

She basically tells me that I should try to socially with my classmates and that eventually, when I'm working, I will have to work in a team.

117,1fsfyk7,WIBTA for asking my mother to pay for my apartment (shared with other students even though we are on a budget and she lives in the same city?,"So first year undergrad and pretty much a big change for me moving to another city and country. I had found and signed myself an apartment for students and I am sooo excited for this.

Thing is she is also looking to move there and looking for apartment for BOTH of us. I keep hinting that I am okay to live alone (and prefer it) because I am pushing her to find an apartment further away from me but she doesnt seem to  read between the lines. 

I want this because I'd like to be independent, to know myself alone, how capable/resourceful I can be. To be young stupid adult. To be responsible and irresponsible. Normal things people my age do. 

I am soaked in guilt and limitations because of her disapprovement or worries about me as a mother which I understand but it really has stopped me to venture further in life because of this guilt and consideration.

She continues to find apartment so close to my uni, and insists for me to not even show up/continue for the apartment I signed and gave deposit (her money) and just find 1 apartment for 2 of us. 

She pays for everything. I dont have my own money and we do not have currently anything incoming. 

Tonight I was annoyed when she told me she found a good apartment 15 min from uni and she is thinking to finalised it. She saw how my mood changed and stopped talking to me.

My dad wasn’t the easiest person to live with : he was so strict with us growing up and was always comparing us to his friend’s children. Nothing ever pleased him and there was always something to complain about. Every reason was good for him to start an argument. He would get mad and say really harsh things to us .He even once told my then 8 yo brother during an argument and i quote :  ’’ what did i do for god to send me a child like you.‘’ Then he would give us the silent treatment for days ( he could spend 5days ignoring me just because i didn’t play well on the last soccer match for exemple ).This was part of our daily routine as we couldn’t go longer than 5 or 6 days without an unnecessary fight.

This ultimately had an impact on our relationship with him. As soon as he’s home from work wewould go to our respective rooms to avoid any contact .We didn’t enjoy family gatherings because we knew anything could lead to a fight and he could humiliate us in front of everyone. I couldn’t consider myself close to him because anytime i try and tell him something that is personal he would go ahead and mention it the next time he’s mad and make me vulnerable about it. I was always finding excuses to avoid going with my parents on vacation because i know it would be a torture.

125,1fse9kv,WIBTA for telling my relative that they're adopted?,"I'm using an alt account and will try to keep things vague in case they lurk this sub, but the details are so specific I wouldn't doubt my friends and family would be able to identify me from this post. That being said, I need to know if I would be an asshole in this situation. Sorry in advance for not being specific with genders or relationships - trying to do my due diligence.

My brother had a baby at a young age (both parents were in their teens). The mom's mother wanted to press charges against my brother and condemned them from having the baby. Nevertheless, my relative was born - let's call them Alex so it's non-gender specific. To prevent Alex from going to a foster home or anything of that sort, my uncle and aunt offered to adopt them so they would stay in the family. Hopefully that all makes sense.

I myself am adopted in a similar way, and so is my brother. Our grandmother and grandfather adopted us for similar reasons when our birth-mother essentially abandoned us. Not once did anyone in our family pretend otherwise; they always told us were adopted, why were were adopted, and what it meant for our grandparents to do that for us. I've never complained and have always been thankful for that.

Fast forward, and Alex has since turned 21. Throughout Alex's life, my uncle and aunt have constantly told me they would tell Alex at various points in their life that they were adopted. At ages 14, 18, etc. Still nothing. Now Alex is in college and is doing better than just about anyone else in our family has ever done. On their way to a master's degree. I couldn't be prouder.

Here's where it gets to be a problem. Our family is all essentially the same race and ethnicity - except my aunt. And because Alex believes that is their birth mother, they are telling everyone that their ""mother's"" ethnicity is theirs, including on social media. And Alex is so clearly not that ethnicity (it's not this scenario, but think of an Egyptian telling everyone they are actually Cambodian). Alex is smart, but I don't know how they can't see this.

In today's climate, I don't want something like that to ruin Alex's life, especially after all the hard work they've done and how well they've stayed out of trouble. I told my uncle and aunt that Alex was doing this and how it could really destroy their potential career. None of them seem to care, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing, and assure me they'll tell Alex eventually.

I know it's not my place to tell Alex, but would I be the asshole if I do? I honestly find it insane they haven't looked at their birth certificate, completed a 23 and Me, asked for photos/stories of how they were born, etc. Alex is also pretty close with their biological mother too as she is still relatively involved in our family and they look almost identical.

**EDIT: Thanks for everyone's comments. I hear you all loud and clear, and it's honestly similar to how I feel too.

Nevertheless, I'll keep biting my tongue.**",Asshole,2024-09-29,"WIBTA for telling my relative that they're adopted? I'm using an alt account and will try to keep things vague in case they lurk this sub, but the details are so specific I wouldn't doubt my friends and family would be able to identify me from this post. That being said, I need to know if I would be an asshole in this situation. Sorry in advance for not being specific with genders or relationships - trying to do my due diligence.

My brother had a baby at a young age (both parents were in their teens). The mom's mother wanted to press charges against my brother and condemned them from having the baby. Nevertheless, my relative was born - let's call them Alex so it's non-gender specific. To prevent Alex from going to a foster home or anything of that sort, my uncle and aunt offered to adopt them so they would stay in the family. Hopefully that all makes sense.

I myself am adopted in a similar way, and so is my brother. Our grandmother and grandfather adopted us for similar reasons when our birth-mother essentially abandoned us. Not once did anyone in our family pretend otherwise; they always told us were adopted, why were were adopted, and what it meant for our grandparents to do that for us. I've never complained and have always been thankful for that.

Fast forward, and Alex has since turned 21. Throughout Alex's life, my uncle and aunt have constantly told me they would tell Alex at various points in their life that they were adopted. At ages 14, 18, etc. Still nothing. Now Alex is in college and is doing better than just about anyone else in our family has ever done. On their way to a master's degree. I couldn't be prouder.

Here's where it gets to be a problem. Our family is all essentially the same race and ethnicity - except my aunt. And because Alex believes that is their birth mother, they are telling everyone that their ""mother's"" ethnicity is theirs, including on social media. And Alex is so clearly not that ethnicity (it's not this scenario, but think of an Egyptian telling everyone they are actually Cambodian). Alex is smart, but I don't know how they can't see this.

In today's climate, I don't want something like that to ruin Alex's life, especially after all the hard work they've done and how well they've stayed out of trouble. I told my uncle and aunt that Alex was doing this and how it could really destroy their potential career. None of them seem to care, that I'm making a big deal out of nothing, and assure me they'll tell Alex eventually.

I know it's not my place to tell Alex, but would I be the asshole if I do? I honestly find it insane they haven't looked at their birth certificate, completed a 23 and Me, asked for photos/stories of how they were born, etc. Alex is also pretty close with their biological mother too as she is still relatively involved in our family and they look almost identical.

**EDIT: Thanks for everyone's comments. I hear you all loud and clear, and it's honestly similar to how I feel too. The potential for bad things as a consequence of Alex unknowingly saying or doing something that is not true has worried me for years. They have confided in me that I am the only one in our family they like and trust, so if something were to happen, I would feel devastated knowing I could have potentially prevented it.

126,1fsdybc,AITA for showing up to my son’s soccer game during my ex-wife’s visitation weekend?,"So, my ex-wife and I have been divorced for 3 years. She lives out of state and I have sole custody of our two sons. She has monthly weekend visitations and this past weekend was her visitation weekend. She works remotely and could move back nearby, which would let her see the kids more regularly, but has chosen not to, and for now this is the arrangement.

Our younger son is in first grade and plays soccer. I’ve been supporting him by attending all of his games this season. It was his 5th out of 6 games, and since my ex-wife was with him for her weekend, I gave her all the information she needed for the game and packed his soccer gear to make it easier for her.

I decided to show up at the game because I wanted to support my son like I always do. I decided to sit near my ex-wife and older son to show that we can be amicable and put our son first. At some point during the game, she noticed that my younger son was giving 50/50 attention between her and me and seemed to get upset. She approached me and aggressively told me, “You need to move down the field because I want this to be a special moment between me and my son,” and said, “You move or I will,” right in front of both our sons. Not wanting to escalate things, I moved further down the field and cheered him on from there for the rest of the game.

After the game, I approached my younger son to give him a hug and tell him he did a great job. I then walked to my car, which was parked two spots down from my ex-wife’s. She followed me there to confront me and said, “Thank you for moving, but that was extremely inappropriate! You know what you were doing, and it will not happen again!” She said this loudly enough for our sons, who were in her car with the door open, to hear. I stayed calm and simply told her to go be with our sons and that I would see them tomorrow when I pick them up. She replied, “You’ll be hearing from me about this!” I just quietly got into my car and drove away. This was yesterday and I have not heard from her yet. Clearly, she was upset and in the future I will not be sitting near her to avoid any more confrontations.

My mom (79F) was very sick for a long time with dementia, alzheimer’s, heart conditions, etc. and unfortunately passed back in July before I could see her.

In the beginning of August I learned that my parents were separated for years and only got back together when they adopted me, but had a lot of resentment towards each other which my dad now tells me about whenever we talk about her. Then there’s his friend Jen (60F). Jen is a widow and befriended my father around February and they’ve been friends since, often hanging out and talking on the phone.

My dad is a pretty lonely guy, he’s old and doesn’t leave the house much (we live \~20 min. outside of town) so I’m happy that he has someone to talk to and lean on and all that, I’m just getting frustrated with everything involving Jen. I haven’t met her, I don’t have a problem with her as a person (she seems really nice) but I feel upset that he’s always with Jen and making plans with her when he never did that kind of stuff with me and mom back when I was growing up.

He always tells me about what he and Jen are going to do together and has invited me to go out to plays and movies with them, but I always decline.

He came over to my house to do the video but we didn’t finish it that day so we have to do it in front of the class.

In Spanish class (friday) I was trying to get him to focus all class. After we finally finished I figured we could go out into the hallway and practice the song. We were near the locker bay (not a chaning room jst lockers) and he was kinda bothering other people there. After a while he sat on the lockers and I asked him to get down.

So, for a little background information, Jane has never been in a relationship and this is her first relationship. Although she is my friend, I have to admit that she acts very desperate with guys and she is always interested in multiple guys at once which further pushes the guys who really like her away. 

Although this happens she met a guy who I believe was in a relationship at that type let's just call him George. When they met, they started flirting but she hid his name and face from us and then later on she told us when they broke up which as you can imagine was surprising to us because she did not tell us when she decided to date him not that we are entitled to know anyways. 

She told us they broke up because she broke it off which was not true at all because every day she would come with stories of how he posted kissing another girl, bad mouthing her to his friends and this made me really feel bad for him because I was once in an abusive relationship and I know what that feels like. We advised her that the best decision she can make is to break off all contact with him to focus on herself and she said she will. 

We stayed for about a week talking about other things and being supportive as we can to her. Only to be told by Mary that Jane has gotten back with George. I was very disappointed by that and I asked Jane on the gc if that was true and she laughed saying that she was just pranking us and that it was a ""stunt"" I asked her what she meant and she refused to explain further. 

We asked her if it was a stunt then why did he kiss another girl and also posted it she did not reply that's when I knew she forgave him for everything but was trying to come up with excuses to make him look less bad and I called her out for it of which she got upset.

Now here is where I may be the AH.. I told her to never discuss her relationship on the gc if she is always going to lie to us and ask for our help but treat it as unimportant and she got pretty upset of which I acknowledged buh still held my ground on how we look at her boyfriend..

Last year at pride, he asked me for help with his and his bf's makeup. He showed up 2 hours late with no word, then ditched me when I finished making up his boyfriend. He then called me hours later, asking me to save him. I showed up and helped him get to a water foundain and bathroom, all the while his abusive friend Lily verbally attacking me, Bob, and my new husband. Then they all ditched me again when I was in the bathroom.

After this, I had a sit down with him and told him I didn't feel respected and felt taken advantage of. I also said that I'd rather he not bring Lily around.

A few weeks later, I invited him to a show I was performing at, and he brought Lily. I found it a little weird that he hadn't even given me a heads up that he was going to bring her. She got drunk and accosted some of the other performers. This is my place of work.

Last week, he said he wanted to do bi-weekly dinners with me. We made plans for 6pm at my place. I checked in with him the day before, making sure the time was good. Next day, food was ready at 6pm. I waited and waited, until finally texting him at 6:45. Then I called at 7pm. Finally at 7:15pm he texted the standard, ""I'm running late."" This time I was like, ""I can see that. Would have liked a head's up ahead of time."" He showed up finally at 7:30, but he did apologize this time.

A few days later, I sent him a long heartfelt text message along the lines of, ""I know you don't mean to, but it hurts me when you don'tgive me a heads up."" I also reiterated that I didn't want him to bring Lily around and told him what had happened at the show.

His response:

""I'm blindsided. This is months of lack of communication. I had no idea... Why is there a lapse in communication?

Do you no longer feel comfortable expressing yourself with me? Do you no longer feel safe to communicate your feelings to me?""

I felt like I had been clear this whole time. I reiterated that I had said what I needed to say and that he was welcome to tell me how he is feeling. This was the response. 

""Thank you for sharing this with me. I work very hard to better myself, I make bad choices, and I learn from them. I'm.sorry I'm.a bad friend.""

I apologized to him that he felt blindsided and that I would try to be more upfront in the future. I can't help but feel like he's punishing me for telling him how I feel. Other times I set boundaries, he flat out ignored me or would get defensive.

I have to wonder whether I'm doing a bad job relaying my feelings or whether he just doesn't want to know. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-09-29,"AITA for setting boundaries with my cousin?
