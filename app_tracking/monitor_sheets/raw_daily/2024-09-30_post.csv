0,1ft5lpq,AITA for refusing to let my dyslexic cousin copy my test?,"I (17F) have a cousin, “Lily” (17F), who’s dyslexic. We’re both in the same WHAP (ap world history) class. Lily has always struggled with school because of her dyslexia, but she gets accommodations like extra time for assignments and tests. Our teacher is aware of her situation and has been pretty understanding.

Last week, we had a big test in the class, and it was really important for our grade. During the test, Lily kept trying to get my attention and quietly asked if she could copy my answers. She said she didn’t understand some of the questions because they were too difficult for her to read, even with the accommodations she had.

I felt bad, but I didn’t want to risk getting both of us in trouble. Our teacher is strict about cheating, and I’ve been working really hard this year because I need good grades for a scholarship. I whispered back that I couldn’t help her and that she should ask the teacher for more help. She got upset and kept glaring at me for the rest of the test.

Later, Lily didn’t do well on the test and got a low grade. Now she’s mad at me, saying I should have helped her because I know she has a hard time with reading. My aunt called me and said I should’ve been more understanding because of Lily’s dyslexia, and that I made her feel humiliated by not helping.

I explained that I didn’t want to cheat and get us both in trouble, but my aunt said I should’ve found a way to help, even if it was just a few answers. Some of my family agrees with her, but I still think it wasn’t my responsibility to break the rules, even though I understand Lily has extra challenges.

1,1ft5k5d,AITAH for putting away my neighbors bike from my spot?,"For context:
We (Husband 28 and me f27) live in a German city where riding by bike to work or school is very VERY common.

We live in an 10 Appartement complex. The Appartement has a garden so we have a 3qm garden shed, the Appartementcomplex also has a shared bicycle shed with reserved and numbered spots with personal outlets for e-bike batteries.

The shared shed is very small for the amount of bikes owned in the complex, some neighbors have 3 or 4 bike per Appartement and only 4 Appartements have their own small sheds because of the gardens. 

6 weeks ago I got an e-bike and started to use our spot in the shared shed to park my bike because I want to load my e-bike and it does not fit in our shed next to our garden equipment and our 2 bikes. Also the garden shed has no outlet. Hence us living in Appartement 1 we have the most convenient spot, right in front of the door. It’s easy to move in and out of the shed.

Onto the issue:
Since day 1 someone moved my e-bike away from our spot, squeezed it in some corner or in an open space and put their own bike in our spot. The first 2 or 3 times I was scared and thought my e-bike got stolen! It is annoying that I need to look for my bike, and that every time I want to go to work, grocery shopping or doing something else. 

After 5 weeks I had enough and taped a paper on my bike that said „do not move it, this is my reserved spot“. I know it sounds petty but I used 20-30 minutes per day looking for my bike and then getting it out of the last corner available, then when coming home I need to move other bikes to be able to get to my outlet and load my bike. 

Today I saw the neighbor moving my bike when I wanted to go grocery shopping. I confronted him and said I don’t want him to move it and that it is my reserved spot. He yelled at me that I did not use this spot for 3 years and now I am not entitled to it and to put it somewhere else, for example my own garden shed. Another neighbor chimed in and said my neighbor is right. They both called me an AH for putting away other bikes to use my spot. 

So my question is, AITAH for putting away bikes and disrupting the order that formed the last 3 years to use my spot? Am I not longer entitled to that spot because I did not use it the years before? ",Not the A-hole,2024-09-30,"AITAH for putting away my neighbors bike from my spot? For context:

2,1ft54p3,AITA for knowingly making my best friend upset?,"my best friend is part of a DID system. for those of you who don't know, DID is the renamed version of multiple personality disorder. it's hard and sucks for him and i do everything i can to support him because i love him dearly and i have mental health issues of my own so i understand how hard it can be at times.

however, in my time with my psychiatrist, ive found a few things i didn't know i had. i already knew i was autistic, but i got diagnosed schizoaffective bipolar and adhd inattentive type. while researching disorders so that i can better understand them because i want to study psychology in the near future, i realized that my understanding of OSDD was inaccurate. ive begun to think that i may very well have it or at least some other type of depersonalization/derealization disorder. i tick an awful lot of boxes on the OSDD symptoms and have found that it's a spectrum so i could have it even if there are boxes i don't tick. i plan to talk to my psychiatrist about this and get a referral to a specialist on wednesday.

the problem with all of this is that my best friend gets really defensive and dismissive when someone points out that they might have something he has or something similar. he did it when i got diagnosed with autism, with schizoaffective, AND with adhd, and i understand what he's coming from that i should consider more options of what these symptoms might be. i do consider more, but my wording is terrible so it sounds like im just focusing on one possibility. 

knowing very well that it would set him off but wanting to talk to at least someone about what i found, i told him what it might be anyway. he didn't yell or get angry, but he admitted that i had made him uncomfortable since dissociation disorders are so personal to him and implied both that i was lying about it (im not, it's a genuine fear of mine that i might be right) and that i was a hypochondriac for thinking this, as well as implying that i didn't have trauma bad enough to have a dissociation disorder (i know i have bad trauma, but i don't remember any of it, so in my opinion it could go either way).

3,1ft50b6,AITA for calling out my brother-in-law and his wife  at dinner?,"Need some help here folks.

So, I live in Latin America where helping your family members in times of financial distress is totally normal. I 100% believe however, that my brother-in-law is basically stealing from my father-in-law. My brother-in-law and his wife own a business where they provide flowers for events such as weddings and baby showers. They're actually quite good at what they do but it's a stretch to say that they're super successful. The wife in particular is extremely materialistic and the family often lives beyond their means in order to appear richer and more successful than they actually are.

Last year, my brother-in-law enrolled his daughter into a very prestigious, private and Catholic preschool that costs a crazy amount a month (around $2000 USD a month which is A LOT in my country). They couldn't afford it and eventually ended up owing the school a ton of money. The school kicked their daughter out which led to the situation this story is about. My brother-in-law went to my father-in-law (his father) and asked him to pay off the debt to the school and to pay for the kid's education as they couldn't afford it. My father-in-law became angry and said that he would pay for his granddaughter's education on the condition that she attend a school of his choice with much cheaper tuition . My brother-in-law's wife became furious and said that if my father-in-law cared about his granddaughter he would send her to the best school possible. My father-in-law refused until they badgered him enough that he gave them the money.

A mere week after this argument, they announced at a family dinner that they were going on an all-inclusive, super expensive trip to Cancun for six days where the resort alone costed the same amount as a monthly payment of their daughter's school tuition. Everyone went dead silent and my father-in-law looked crushed. I exploded on them and demanded to know where the money my father-in-law gave them went. Admittedly, I could have been a bit more diplomatic in what I said but I basically called them out for spending money on a luxury vacation while having the balls to ask family members for money. They glared at me and accused me of coming from a culture where families don't care about one another (I come from immigrant parents). They also told me the money transaction had nothing to do with me and that they didn't owe me an explanation.  They haven't spoken to me or my husband since. What do you all think?

5,1ft4khj,AITAH For not letting my girlfriend sister to sleep at our apartment 2x a week?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for over two and a half years. I'm 28, she's 23. We've moved around a lot—first in a shared flat with her friends for a year, then in a small apartment for six months, and after that, in another shared flat abroad for six months. Now we’re back in her home country. I’ve been staying in a shared flat, and she’s been with her family while we searched for a place of our own.

We finally found our dream apartment—it’s the perfect size, in a great location, and reasonably priced. We’ve spent the last month furnishing and cleaning it, and now it’s almost ready. We’re excited to have our own space.

For context, I live abroad, but we’re currently in her country, where her small family—just her mom and 20-year-old sister—live. Her sister studies in the capital and commutes about two hours each way. A few months ago, we said she could stay with us occasionally after staying out late, which seemed reasonable at the time.

Two weeks ago, my girlfriend told me her mom and sister asked if her sister could stay with us once a week, on Wednesdays, because her classes end at 8 p.m., and she has an early start at 9 a.m. the next day. I wasn’t thrilled since we don’t have a spare room, and she’d have to sleep in the living room where our TV and my PC are. I’d been looking forward to having some privacy. Also, I commuted for years, so I didn’t see it as a big issue for her sister to continue.

But my girlfriend was upset, and her family pressured her, so I eventually agreed, even though I wasn’t happy. I figured one night a week was a reasonable compromise.

A week passed, her sister stayed over, and everything seemed fine. My girlfriend went home for the weekend, as she often does, but when she came back, she told me her mom now wanted her sister to stay twice a week—on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Her Tuesday classes also finish at 8 p.m., and her Wednesday classes start at 11 a.m. When my girlfriend pushed back, saying that it wasn’t just her decision and that I should have a say, her mom became critical. She accused my girlfriend of not caring about her sister, said she should have given her sister money instead, threatened to cancel a holiday they had planned, and even told her she should have found a boyfriend who liked her family more. It felt like emotional blackmail.

Now, my girlfriend is feeling pressured and wants me to agree to her sister staying twice a week to avoid more conflict with her family. I, however, feel like I’ve already compromised by allowing her to stay once a week. While I understand the importance of maintaining good relations with her family, I think it’s unfair that her mom is manipulating the situation to get what she wants, and I’m expected to just go along with it. I feel I should have a say in my own home and the right to privacy, especially since my girlfriend is only here five days a week, and her sister would be here two of those days.

6,1ft3ret,AITAH for calling my dad on his disrespectful behavior?,"Hey everyone. Yesterday, during a family gathering, me, my wife (33F), my aunt, and my parents were involved in an open discussion about sports figures. It was a regular conversation, except for a few moments which I will expound on.
A little about my dad—we get along great but sometimes he has a tendency to talk over people an/or interrupt to get his viewpoint across, even if it is during the most importune time. 
During the conversation, he did this not once, but twice to my wife. As she tried to state her point after the last interruption, my dad talks over her and says, “I know what your point is” and continues on with speaking. 
 My blood ran hot. I briefly wondered if I was overacting. My dad finished his statement and my wife responded, “Like I was trying to say,” with visible aggravation and finishes her point. So, I knew I wasn’t overreacting.
My dad was obviously upset by the reaction, said something else concerning the conversation and went to the den to watch football. My mom and my aunt sat there at the table, quiet. I announced that we were leaving, and we gathered up our things, packed up the baby, said our goodbyes and left.,

I spent the ride home gauging my wife’s mood, and assessed that she definitely was upset. After we arrived home. I told her she did the right thing and the reason we left was because that was rude and uncalled for. Also, I needed to leave before addressing the infraction with him in the wrong way.

After I cooled off, I called my dad and asked if he was busy. He said no, and I brought up what happened earlier and how disrespected I felt and how disrespected my wife felt for his actions at the gathering. 

He claimed he didn’t remember doing anything that was disrespectful, and wanted me to walk back through the conversation. I told him that how the conversation unfolded wasn’t the issue so much as what he did was. His tone as we spoke was aggressive, disagreeable. He offered a backhanded apology, something along the lines of “I’m sorry you feel that way. If I disrespected you, I’m sorry…” etc etc. When he mentioned again not recalling what was disrespectful, I reiterated the problem, and how it would be an issue no matter who it was said to generally. He then accused me of calling him to scold him. I told him that wasn’t the case at all, and if he understood the perspective in which I was coming. He said he did, and offered more of the same, even going as far as to say he would apologize to my wife himself. I didn’t put her on the phone, as I didn’t want the same backhanded apology given to her too. I even told him that I do forgive him, and accept his apology, but I wanted to know if he understood why we were hurt the way we were.  After trying once more to get through to him, he cut me off several more times before repeating his stance and saying that this was the end of it before ending the phone call.

My S/O has been struggling with being in our geographical area because he feels he’s “exhausted” the area. He’s bounced around from job to job and his family has stayed in the area for generations so he wants to move. I have shut this down other times because he is always trying to do it on a whim. Recently - he brought up the idea of travelling. 

I am open to discussing travel which could even one day lead to relocation. He is upset that I am open to one part and not the other. 

The issue is we are not financially stable - we are living pay check to pay check and I am the only one with a stable job & pay. We don’t have passports to travel and can’t really afford them at this point. 

He is always talking about relocation with a sense of urgency. Like he wants to move tomorrow. He has no jobs lined up. He has no housing lined up. He wants to just go and “figure it out”. I can’t do that. I need a plan. We need to have savings in case we can’t find jobs right away. He isn’t understanding or willing to listen to any of my concerns - he just says I’m holding him back and want to be stuck here forever. 

I currently am not wanting to talk about any major life changes as my grandmother passed yesterday afternoon. I am just trying to grieve her and I asked him to table this discussion for a week to allow me to grieve before we start arguing. He just left for his mother’s house and was refusing to speak with me because I won’t have this conversation immediately.

8,1ft3iah,AITA for catching a homeless cat in my neighbourhood? ,"I (24F) live in a neighbourhood in Sweden with my family(mom, dad & brother)where everybody lives super close to each other so usually when something unusual happens, everybody close by notices. Back in the beginning of March a black cat showed up to my garden and at first I though it was a neighbours cat, but after a few weeks it was obvious that it wasn't anybody cat. I started to feed it every night when it showed up and in a way adopt it as my own cat since I was taking care of it. 

After 2 months it started to lose a lot of weight, getting a lot of ticks etc not doing well so I contacted 5 cat shelters looking to see if someone could help me catch it to see if it was someone's cat that was missing and eventually take it to the vet to get the proper care. One cat shelter responded and came by the next day with a trap that closes on its own when the cat steps on a trigger inside. But the cat was either very smart or just scared so it never went inside. The staff from the shelter came back after 1 month to try another trap that also didn't work. Me and my family then went on a 2 week vacation and wouldn't be home but the staff promised me to catch the cat before we got back and they did just that and caught it 4 days before we got back home. 

They took the cat for check ups etc and it was not neutered or had any chip so it was feral 4 year old male cat. I was so happy they caught it so it can be taken cared of and get into a good home. The issue is one of my neighbourhood thinks I was cruel into stressing and catching the cat as it should be free and do whatever it wants, even though they KNOW that the cat was getting sick and not doing well anymore in the wild. I understand their point that animals should be free and not be locked in a home but on the other hand it wasn't doing well....

11,1ft3387,AITAH for agreeing to help a friend’s family member after a hurricane ,"My (51f) husband (50m) is not speaking to me because I’ve agreed to have a family member of a friend stay at our extra house after she lost everything in a hurricane. My husband says I should never have agreed to it without running it by him but I honestly didn’t think there was anything to be concerned about. Let me explain some critical points. We’ve been married just over a year. We have a marital home we bought together. 

My husband doesn’t work but does take care of our shared home including overseeing some remodeling work. I have a home that was mine prior to our marriage. My son (17) still lives in this house (his childhood home) and I split my time between the 2 houses. 

I made it clear when we got married and bought a house (which we did sooner than I normally would have because my husband was losing his job) that I would keep my extra house until my son was 18. My son’s best friend’s grandmother had flooding at her house. 

My son asked me over the weekend if she could stay at the extra house. I said yes. Initially it was only a day or two. She’s stayed at the house before — actually was a pet and house sitter for me in the past so I didn’t think twice about it. When I mentioned it to my husband, he got very angry. He said I never should have agreed without running it by him and that he feels like I don’t care enough about him to bring this to him before just agreeing. I told him I was sorry. I wasn’t trying to hide anything. I just didn’t see the big deal. 

Fast forward 24 hours and they asked if she could stay with us 4 more days while she figures out what to do. I went to my husband and asked his opinion. He said absolutely not. I tried to ask him why he felt that way and he basically said it was because he was still mad at me. I said that’s not a fair reason to throw an elderly woman on the street and he just said well you did that by not talking to me in the first place. 

I told him he was being unreasonable and irrational. I finally just said my heart tells me to help because I see no downside or risk. He basically said “do what you want — you will anyway”. And he hasn’t spoken to me since and is refusing to let me at our shared house. So AITAH for letting her stay at the extra house?

12,1ft2nyn,AITA for telling my parents I'm not changing my name because of their name regret?,"I'm (16m) my parents youngest kid and the only kid the name based on what they liked vs what the family wanted them to name us. My siblings were all named after family members like both my dad's and mom's families prefer. By the time they got around to having me they were live fuck this shit and told their family they were choosing a name based on what they liked and not based on family. So they named me Sunny. Yeah, the ""girl version"" of Sonny. I don't care. I don't think Sunny is girly because it has a u vs an o. But anyway.

My parents started to regret my name when I was maybe 10? I don't remember exactly when but I can remember being about 10 and my parents started sometimes calling me by my middle name and only stopping when I told them it was weird and I liked my first name. When I was 13 they asked me if I ever went by a nickname and I said no.

Last year they said some kids change their names before graduating high school because they want something more grown up and they want to save the added expense of changing the name on their degree. I was like oh, I guess if people want that it makes sense. Then I said it must suck to hate your name.

Six months ago my parents said I look like a James nicknamed Jamie. I asked them why they thought that and they said I just had that look. They asked what I thought of the name and I said I like Jamie but prefer Sunny. Then they asked if I liked the name Luke and I said no.

In June they asked me if I would consider letting them change my name to something different. They said they feel like they named me as a big fuck you to their families but felt bad that I had such an unserious name for a man. I told them I didn't want to change my name and I always loved the way they talked about finding my name. They said their feelings had changed and they felt like the name being cute and light and full of hope wasn't great for going into my adult years. They said they deeply regretted it. I told them I was glad they made the choice they did and they shouldn't stress it. But last week they got the paperwork for a legal name change and presented me with like three name choices and asked me to pick. They said they really didn't want to live with the guilt. I told them I'm not changing my name because of their name regret. I told them how I feel about my name is more important now. They told me I should at least think of their feelings and that I should consider the future and whether I'll be taken seriously.

14,1ft24bv,AITA for telling my dad that mom deserves better than him?,"I’ve been dealing with some stuff at home. My mom's pregnant with her fourth kid after a 10 year marriage, and now they’re trying to fix things while dating again. Honestly, I kinda like my dad less around my mom. I’d prefer if he spent more time away from me. 

He’s always worked a ton, but since last year, he’s been cutting back. It’s cool when I only see him on weekends. 

Last week, he stayed the whole week to help my mom with stuff before going back to his place. But he’s been bossing me around nonstop! I know I mess up sometimes, but I’d rather my mom be the one to call me out. It’s the little things: taking out the trash, setting the table, asking if I did my homework, cleaning my room. He never gives me props it’s like I’m always in trouble or doing something wrong. My mom is way better, she reminds me of stuff without being harsh and thanks me when I help out. She even checks if I need school help, even if I haven’t asked in a while. My dad just acts like he’s the boss.

Lately, my mom’s been super distracted. She has ADHD and sometimes her focus just vanishes. This week has been one of those times, she forgot food on the stove 3 times. She said she can’t handle everything sometimes and needs help, so my dad came over, which is weird since she usually asks my stepgrandma.

All this is driving me crazy. On Saturday, my mom was on a work trip, and my dad had to work, so my siblings had a babysitter. In the afternoon I went out with friends, and when I got home, my dad was cleaning the house with a mad face. I just went to my room to play games with my friends. 

About five minutes in, my sister asked me to set the table since it was my turn, and I said I’d finish my game. Twenty minutes later, my dad knocked and told me to set the table. I said, ‘I’ll be there in a sec; it’s a competitive match.’ He sighed and said I had five minutes. I told him it was twenty minutes left. He just stood there in silence, staring at me. When the game ended, he turned off my setup, unplugged everything, and took my PC out of my room. 

We yelled at each other. The last straw for him was when I said my mom deserves better than a workaholic dad who doesn’t know anything about his kids. He just sighed and said he’d rather not talk to me right now and sent me to my room. 

He looked really frustrated, and I felt like a jerk. But my friend said my dad is a total jerk and deserved to hear it. Now my dad isn’t talking to me and I’m not talking with him, but he’s acting normal with my siblings. My mom’s coming home tomorrow, and I don’t want to add to her stress. Aita? 

Edit:

To be clear:I always help out! My mom sets up a task system that me and my siblings are responsible for. But my dad wants me to do things right when he asks, and my mom isn't like that. But when I forget, my mother reminds us, or we still have to deal with the consequences. While my father is more Controlling.

15,1ft23ly,AITA For yelling at my guy best friends fiancée? ,"Hey everyone! My name is Morgan. I have a guy best friend named Josh that I met online a few years ago. I want to clear the air immediately that we have only ever been friends, I have a fiancé and a baby. 

Josh was a shell when I met him. His girlfriend of 5 years ghosted him, he hated his job, and was in general in a really bad place. We met playing an online video game, and shortly after became friends. He and I would often game together, and I tried to help him slowly build his life back up. He quit his job and pursued his dream career, got back into old hobbies and even joined dating sites. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago, Josh and I had been friends for 2 years, when he met Parker. Parker is absolutely stunning, and he became enamoured quickly. I was so beyond happy for him when they became official. Josh tried introducing Parker and I, but she was super closed off and a little snippy. Josh said she must’ve just been shy

Parker never came around to me, purposely ruins our once a week game nights and even planned a surprise vacation the week of my baby’s party, (that she was also invited to) so Josh wouldn’t come. I should add that I’m from New York, and Josh is from Vancouver. 

Josh proposed to Parker about a week or so ago, and she said yes. I am STOKED that she said yes. However, Josh let me know that Parker and him got into a fight because she doesn’t want my fiancé and I to come to the wedding. 

I can’t lie that it definitely upset me, I’ve tried really hard to stay on Parker’s good side but I will always understand her point of view bc I have been burned by a girl best friend. 

Last night Parker called me and said that I wasn’t welcome at her wedding no matter what Josh says, and that I should just back off because once they’re married she’s going to make sure I’m  out of his life forever. I tried to explain to her that while I understand her concerns, Josh and I have only ever been friends, and I tried really hard to be nice to her. She called me some names and I lost it. 

I told her she needs to grow up, that it’s insane she can’t respect Josh’s feelings. I told her I’ve never been anything but nice to her despite everything she’s ever said and done. I told her we are adults and the fact that she acts like a teenager is sad. 

She hung up and now Josh is mad at me because he says I am making things difficult. I told him that I’ve spent 2 years taking abuse from her, and that he should’ve just let me go no contact when I offered, to save myself from all this stress. 

My fiancé is on my side, but a few of my other friends say I had no place being his friend after he found a girlfriend, and that me yelling at her makes me TA. 

So, AITA? 

TlL:DR Guy best friends fiancé hates me , doesn’t want me at their wedding , berates me on the phone and I call her immature ",Everyone Sucks,2024-09-30,"AITA For yelling at my guy best friends fiancée?  Hey everyone! My name is Morgan. I have a guy best friend named Josh that I met online a few years ago. I want to clear the air immediately that we have only ever been friends, I have a fiancé and a baby. 

Josh was a shell when I met him. His girlfriend of 5 years ghosted him, he hated his job, and was in general in a really bad place. We met playing an online video game, and shortly after became friends. He and I would often game together, and I tried to help him slowly build his life back up. He quit his job and pursued his dream career, got back into old hobbies and even joined dating sites. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago, Josh and I had been friends for 2 years, when he met Parker. Parker is absolutely stunning, and he became enamoured quickly. I was so beyond happy for him when they became official. Josh tried introducing Parker and I, but she was super closed off and a little snippy. Josh said she must’ve just been shy

16,1ft1zyr,AITA for not getting fully dressed to go to the bathroom?,"I (18F) live with my 2 roommates (19F) and  (28F)
I moved in with my first roommate (19F) about 3 months ago  we will call her Luna. Me and Luna are really good friends and have been for awhile. it was nothing unusual to see each other change or be ""indecent"" we lived together for about 2 months before our other roommate (28F) moved in we will call her summer. Summer is also one of our close friends but not as close as me and luna. Luna never had a problem with changing in front of me or vice versa until summer moved in and was uncomfortable with us being ""indecent"" around the house which I have respected.

Summers idea of indecent is anything less then shorts going to your knees and a T-shirt (tank top if it's really hot) I understand this and 9 time out of 10 have decent clothes on. Recently I have started working 3rd shift im gone from 10pm to around 8am when I get home summer is gone for work and Luna is still sleeping till about 1pm. When I get home I get ready for bed usually just in boxers and a sports bra typical bedtime clothes, when I have to go to the bathroom I just go, I don't put on a shirt or pants if I'm going back to bed because my bedroom is about 5 feet away from the bathroom door. So I will just get up go to the bathroom and go back to bed.

Today I woke up around 12:30 got up went to the bathroom and said hi to Luna on the way back to bed she was in the living room, which I have to pass to get back to my bedroom, note the couch isn't facing the hallway, I just leaned in said hi and went to go back to bed but Luna started talking to me so I waited because leaving while she's talking would be rude.

Well it just so happened that summer was on the phone for her lunch break and was talking to Luna. When Luna was done with what she was telling me she looked back and said ""why are you n4ked!?"" I was not I had boxers and a sports bra on. Luna has never had an issue with this before or even up till now unless summer is on the phone with her then it's a huge deal. Today summer made a smart comment about me being indecent and she wasn't even home. AITA for not wanting to put on clothes to go 5 feet out and back? 

Note. If Luna's uncomfortable with this and would tell me I would respect it but she literally does not care unless summer is on the phone, I also do put at least a shirt on most of the time but sometimes I'm going straight back to bed so I don't feel the need. 
    Another note. My room is basically a hallway you have to go through the back door into the mudroom/laundry room and through my room to get into the house so Luna sees me in my sleeping clothes quite often because thats how she gets to her car, Summer parks around front but still goes through my room often, I try to put it in the group chat when I'm sleeping in the day and will be in my sleeping clothes, I don't always sleep like this but my room gets hot so it is often.
Sorry for bad spelling and punctuation! :')

EDIT: so for the room situation I am planing on moving into the garage as we only use it for minimal storage and this should help with some of the problems.

EDIT 2: they are genuinely some of the nicest and helpful people I have ever met they've helped me through a lot and been there for me. to help with some confusion we are all religious so we do have a standard for decency but when your in your own home some things are different we don't see eye to eye on this one unfortunately.

Obligatory “on mobile,” looking to hear mostly from Brits here

So I’m American, so I’m generally used to my cultural norm being assholery abroad and I generally try to avoid this. The other night I saw a performance of Alice in Wonderland by the Royal Ballet on opening night and when the performance was over and the curtain came down, my group gave a standing ovation when the performers came out. I am aware that standing ovations are reserved for exceptional performances, but I flew in from a different continent to see this show, it was opening night,  and I had the opportunity to see a dancer I’ve followed for a while give his all and really wow me.

The gentleman behind us tapped me once and told me to sit down, I ignored him and he then yelled at me that he couldn’t see and demanded I sit down. It was the second bow and he was insistent, so I complied, but it really irked me. I wasn’t disruptive during the actual performance and only got up during the bow. I’m a former pre-professional ballet dancer myself and while I wouldn’t expect a standing ovation, it’s always deeply appreciated as a performer. These people worked INCREDIBLY hard while I sat on my ass and enjoyed the show. I saw a few other people giving a standing ovation, but a person behind me was also yelled at and he moved into the aisle to continue. This is why I think I might be the asshole here.

18,1ft1r3n,AITA for lying to my parents about living with my boyfriend ,"To give a little context, my siblings and I (27F) all have a strained relationship with our parents. They are extremely religious and have always pushed their beliefs and religious morals on us. They never listen to us and do not treat us as the adults we are; thus not allowing us to make choices that we feel is best for our lives. My parents are extremely emotionally immature and never acknowledge their faults nor confront their true feelings. My parents, to me, are purely an exoskeleton of parents. We do not truly connect. 

I had been dating someone (now ex) of 5+ years and decided to live with him on our last year. Our parents, resented me for this. Our mom had specifically said that she would never call me, never visit our home, and wanted to “hit” my ex bf. Our mom claims that she never even had resentment to begin with, but it was very apparent. 

To the actual scenario, I have a new bf now, “T” (29M). Our parents and family adore him. My sister (23F), T, and I have decided to move to a new state and live together as there are many benefits for each of us. I realize that this decision will cause a rift in our family. In order to still live how I feel is best and to keep my relationship with our parents, I have to lie to them and say that T will live separately. I am also cautious of being honest as I finally have someone our parents love and hold no resentment towards. 

I have told our brother, “R” (29M), of my plans. R heavily disagrees purely based on the fact that lying is morally wrong and that he “wouldn’t be able to look our parents in the eyes knowing the truth.” He went as far as to compare it to as if a friend told him that they plan to cheat on their partner. I know that lying is morally wrong, but this scenario is just different. He made the argument that I didn’t HAVE to, and I understand that I don’t HAVE to, but me not living with T for the sake of our parents opinions only withholds their control on our decisions. R also states that the lie will eventually come out and only be worse. I agree that I should tell the truth now bc our parents will feel betrayed. With that being said, I feel that I should only tell them bc of R’s passion towards telling the truth. I apologize for how cold and callous this is, but R is a loose end & I don’t doubt that he would to confess to our parents. R also feels sorry for our parents as they have been gracious enough to let me live with them after I needed help post past breakup. It is very kind of our parents to lend a helping hand, but he acts as if I am taking advantage of them. Of course, I am grateful and I show my gratitude, but I don’t owe our parents the right for them to dictate my life.

19,1ft1mfu,AITA for making someone give me a description of their lost item before returning it?,"So I live in a big student apartment complex, and while you have to be a student to be in the lease, it’s pretty easy for anyone to get into the building. While I was walking in the hall today, I found a gold Cartier ring on the ground. I don’t know jewellery very well but I knew this was expensive so I put a note up by the elevator with my name and apartment number and said found a lost ring, come by anytime to get it, and brought the ring back to my room. My thinking was that most people would probably just take it and it seemed pretty valuable. A few hours later a girl knocked on my door asking if I was the one who found a ring.

I said yes of course what did the ring you lost look like before I go grab it? (if you can’t give me a vague description probably not yours right?). Immediately she lost it on me and started threatening calling the police since I’m stealing from her. I finally calmed her down enough to explain that I just didn’t want someone looking for a new free ring grabbing it, and I don’t want a detailed manifesto on the ring, just something so I know it’s yours and she told me “size three gold Cartier ring”, which was the one I had so I said give me two seconds I’ll go grab it and went to shut the door and she lost it again demanding to come inside with me while I grabbed it. 

Obviously I’m not letting her in cause I don’t know her and she just finished screaming at me, so I just shut and locked while I ran to grab it and the entire time she was screaming calling me an asshole making a massive scene in the hall. She finally left when I gave her the ring and now I’m sitting here flabbergasted at the interaction. I genuinely thought I was doing the right thing, but I’m started to question if I went about this in an asshole way? Please be brutally honest here, I always assumed that was standard practise for returning a lost item, but I also know what they say about when you assume so I’d like to know for future interactions if I was right and she was being unreasonable, or I just went about it wrong.

Since he moved out my mom made me take all my clothes to put in the other closet znd made the rule that me and my sister ""shouldn't wear the same clothes because it's a sign of envy"". So that's what i did. Another rule she made was that my sister and i shouldn't use the same cleaning items (towel etc (yes we use to share those don't ask questions))

My sister is the type of a person that is lazy as heck so when she goes out of the shower she always takes my towel. Which is annoying because it's disrespecting the rules and when I told her nicely to stop she doesn't so i have to yell on her to stop. 

So today, my family and I had to go do some paperworks and My sister had taken one of my sweaters which she always does no matter how much i told her to stop or to just ask me before taking them. During the ride to get there, i asked her if i could have my own sweater and she gave it to me. I was feeling a little sick and kinda cold too. Some minutes later she asked for it back and i said i was still cold. So i told her maybe she could ask my mother's scarf and she got upset and said ""give it to me already"". I then replied ""but it's mine so-"" my mother jumped in and said ""You're so selfish (sister's name) take my scarf."" 

Afterwards she was upset with me because of that and because yesterday i told her i didn't like one of her old shirt she wantdd to give to me i founded it a little childish (there were litteral mermaids on that thing). Once we got home we had to get ready to go back to school and i told my sister ""you should go and plan what you'll wear"" she said she had all the time and when it was time to go she took one of my sweaters again that my father had both for me. 

I haven't even wore it yet. So i just ask ""you know it's my sweater right? You know the school doesn't accept those kind of sweaters? Could you atleast not dirty it?"" (ps it was beige close to white the school doesn't allow those kind of sweaters.) And my mother jumped in again and said ""(Sister's name) go take another sweater and let miss.Mean Girl's sweaters.

21,1ft1cxq,AITA for asking my cousin to shut off his cameras?,"Hello all. I went to visit my cousin this weekend and I felt very uncomfortable with their use of in home tech.  

It makes me feel like I’m under surveillance the whole time. I guess their neighbor’s house had a home invasion and my cousin wife took things too far. 

I asked them about it and they have 360 cameras outside but also the these those echo’s that turn on lights and stuff. Even the young children would vocally ask lights to be tuned on in a room instead of flipping a switch. 

I’m a simple person and when his wife asked if we needed anything from a camera it freaked me out and I asked my cousin if he could turn them off while I was there. 

He said no. I felt really uncomfortable when I found out it’s possible people could be listening to our conversation and brought it up to my dad and grandpa about it.

It makes me feel like I’m under surveillance the whole time. I guess their neighbor’s house had a home invasion and my cousin wife took things too far. 

I asked them about it and they have 360 cameras outside but also the these those echo’s that turn on lights and stuff. Even the young children would vocally ask lights to be tuned on in a room instead of flipping a switch. 

I’m a simple person and when his wife asked if we needed anything from a camera it freaked me out and I asked my cousin if he could turn them off while I was there. 

He said no. I felt really uncomfortable when I found out it’s possible people could be listening to our conversation and brought it up to my dad and grandpa about it.

22,1ft1aj9,AITA: Yelling at my parents that I’ve had an awful day and ruining their vacation?,"I've been a long-time lurker on this thread but never felt I had something to share until now.

I (25F) live with my parents (F50s, M50s) while I finish grad school. We have a great relationship. I love them and they love me. I am incredibly lucky.

Last week, my parents went on a vacation to a large city 5 hours away. They were gone for 3 days and 2 nights. I was in charge of watching our family’s very loved and very spoiled dog.

I travel a lot for work. When they told me a week in advance that they’d be going on vacation those days, I let them know that I already had a work trip scheduled for the first 2 days of their trip in a city 2.5 hours away. To accommodate them, I cancelled my hotel reservation, switched around some events, and made it so that I could drive there and back both of those days from my events. I was happy to do this to give my parent a break.

Here’s where things went downhill—on the second day of their trip, hurricane Helene came in land. I had to travel back from my work event in the thick of the hurricane weather on a flat smooth highway. In any other situation, I would’ve pulled over and waited it out, but I had to get home to my dog who had been home alone for 6 hours at this point. I drove for 2.5 hours through 45 mph winds and torrential downpour rain. I got blown across lanes, passed a total of 8 accidents, and watched a vehicle spin out and then flip over in the median. I am a confident driver, but this was a scary experience.

When I got home, the power was out. We access our house through an electric garage. That was not working due to the lack of power. I called my parents in a panic, and by the grace of whatever higher power you believe in, my dad had put house keys in my car’s glovebox the week prior without my knowledge.

I stayed on the phone as I unlocked the door. And here is where I am the AH. The stress of the previous 3 hours caught up to me and I yelled that I had an awful day. I added curse words. Then we all quietly said our I love yous, and I hung up.

I texted them this a few hours later: “Still no power. I’m sorry for what I said. It’s been a stressful day, but context doesn’t absolve responsibility. I am sorry for how I acted. I hope (city) is fun!” They did not respond, and that is unusual as they typically treat me like their personal Snapchat.

They came home the next day. I asked about trip details and things were normal. Later, my aunt (mom’s sister) texted me telling me I ruined my parent’s trip with my attitude and that they were not able to relax because of how worried they were. She said I needed to do something to make up for the way I acted.

I feel so guilty for how I spoke to them, but I already apologized and things seem normal. And, to be honest, I feel like my frustration at the situation was justified. I feel torn and don’t know what to do. So AITA?

23,1ft15ik,AITA for being politely blunt with my sister about having a foster baby?,"Hello, so for a little backstory my sister and I come from a dysfunctional home and childhood, I won't go into it, but there's a lot that we have had to heal from and there's a lot of things that we still deal with because of our parents. (Being extremely impulsive is one of these things, as we get it from both parents.)

For a little more backstory, my sister is in a stage of life where, in my opinion, she really needs to focus on getting better and getting her life together. She recently had a stroke (was a mini stroke, where no damage was done but she was having a lot of headaches, isochemic stroke I believe), she's overweight, vapes, and generally not healthy. (she is working on it) She also doesn't have a career, has a job (but she doesn't like the job, and there's not much potential for growth.), and is currently in school for nursing. Last semester she failed a class and has to redo the class this semester.

So, my sister and I have always had a very close relationship, and I called her earlier to talk about pet insurance I was getting for my cat. During this same exact phone call she said that she doesn't have pet insurance on her two dogs because they can't afford it. A bit after this, she told me that her and her husband were doing the steps for foster care to get a baby. I told her that I support her and that I think it's a good idea, but I really think she should consider going through the process more thoroughly to actually get one. She explained that I was being blunt, and was upset.

Her husband carries a gene that makes it near impossible to have children, as two years ago they were looking into IVF but ultimately could not afford it. (She was upset with me about this because I wouldn't loan her some money to help) But I stood my ground then explaining that she's rushing this and to just go with the flow, and that them not having enough money to go with the procedure can be looked at as more time to get ready so they are more prepared for when their baby does come.

I'm hit with grief because I feel for her so much, and I'm torn between expressing my support for her decision (which I would do regardless) and being truthful and honest about how I feel. I feel like I was very polite, but blunt. I do not feel like her having a child right now is the best for her, and I believe that she needs to focus on getting healthy, and getting to a point where she isn't failing school before throwing a child into the mix. I told her that I don't make her decisions, and I don't control her, but I can't just tell her what she wants to hear. I let her know that whatever decision she makes I will support her in whatever way possible, and that I love her and I'm just giving her my two cents as a big brother.

24,1ft0tc9,WIBTA if I stiff the limo driver from our wedding on the remaining balance?,"Our wedding was Saturday. It was amazing in so many ways, but damn did our limo driver really screw things up. At this point I am planning to tell him he will need to take me to court if he wants the remaining balance on our contract ($950 out of ~$1350) but I’m wondering if that would make me an asshole.

The TLDR is that the driver was not there when he was supposed to be, couldn’t seem to actually drive the limo, and ruined our wedding portraits.


The whole story:
I’ve worked in the event industry for about a decade, but have never had to use a transportation company so was starting from scratch here. I spoke to five different companies, and chose the one I did because the owner seemed like he knew what he was doing. They weren’t the cheapest, but getting us all to the wedding is an important job and not one I wanted to pinch pennies on. 

Booked the limo for eight hours. Venue was only about an 8 minute drive from the hotel but we built in a good buffer. His schedule was:
4:30 - Groom and groomsmen 
5pm - bride and bridesmaids 
5:20pm - Guests
5:40pm - Guests (anyone running late, everyone would have fit the first time)

The entrance to our hotel is on a busy street that has construction happening, reducing the street from 3 lanes to 2. There is a turn in for guests and valet, and at the exit there’s a sign to let folks on the street side know that it’s exit only. I later learned that limos aren’t supposed to pull into this area at all, that they actually have a different pickup spot for limos, and that limo companies usually call the hotel in advance to coordinate.

Clearly none of this happened, because the driver pulled into the valet section, loaded up the guys, and proceeded to get STUCK. I wasn’t there to witness it but everyone who was said it was like the scene in Austin Powers. It took him TWENTY MINUTES and an 87 point turn to get the limo out. HE DIDN’T EVEN HAVE TO TURN IT AROUND! He just couldn’t seem to maneuver around the sign at the exit, and instead of asking the valet guys to move it he decided to kidnap my groom for twenty minutes. They finally get on their way and now there are road closures for some kind of event, so he goes some crazy long way to get there because he was not prepared with an alternate route. They guys didn’t make it to the venue until 5:10 - ten minutes after me and my girls were supposed to be picked up.

We headed down to the front at 4:55, and I’m starting to panic as time keeps passing and the limo isn’t back yet. We haven’t heard from him and the only info we have is that the guys got dropped off and that the driver is an idiot. It’s now 5:20 and I’ve got my cousins standing in the lobby playing defense to make sure the guests don’t see me before I’m walking down the aisle. 5:30 rolls around and we see the limo drive by the hotel, but not stop. At this point I’m like screw this, and the hotel valet rushes to get my car, we stuff me and my giant ballgown into the back of my Kia EV9 (I love that car) and a bridesmaid’s husband drives me and two of the girls to the venue. The rest of the girls are trying to figure out if it would be faster to call Lyfts or try to pack into someone’s car, and the limo finally shows back up and parks on the street so they all rush to it to get over to the venue. I get there about 5:45 and they get there maybe 5 minutes later. Limo driver then insists on parallel parking before letting them out, which takes another five minutes. The guests who were supposed to take the limo after us all either drove themselves or used a rideshare.

All of this chaos, but me and half of the bridal party are event people so we know how to deal. We manage to only have to start our ceremony 10 minutes late, which may not seem so bad, but means that we have ten less minutes for photos afterwards. I figure that’s ok though. Our plan is to do group photos in the courtyard and then the limo will drive hubby and I with our photographer and videographer to a nearby spot to get some amazing twilight and sunset photos. Limo company knew this was the plan.

We are half way through the group photos (which were only going to take about 20 minutes) and I ask someone to let the limo driver know to be ready. They go to look for him and he’s gone, so my coordinator calls him to see what’s up. He’s never supposed to be more than 5-10 minutes away from the venue, but tells her he is 20 minutes away. Dude, what the hell?!? We decide to use the time to take extra photos with our kids, but twenty minutes pass and he is still MIA and now not answering his phone. We decide to change our plan and go somewhere closer, stuff me and the giant ballgown in the back of the photographers SUV, and make a mad dash for it. We are now thirty minutes behind schedule, the sun is setting rapidly at the point. But my photographer and videographer are being amazing and helping hubby and I not panic. 

We get there and have about five minutes to get photos before the sun is completely gone. They have to bust out their high powered light and we make the best of it, get some really awesome shadow photography, but we all know the reality of the situation. To make matters worse, we are an interracial couple, so good lighting is absolutely crucial for photographs. I know my photographer will continue to be a rockstar and give us the best she can, but I also know this situation created WAY more work for her in post and that enrages me.

We drive back to the venue and as we are getting out of the car the limo is pulling up. Mind you, this is now like 45 minutes after we first sent someone to look for him. Driver gets out and approaches to speak to me, and I go off on him. “You do not want to try to talk to me right now, I am incredibly angry and you are not going to like what I have to say, so you better back up and give me space”. I swear, I have not been Bridezilla at all. I am pretty chill. But as my groom said in his vows, I am the Paladin of this party and my righteous anger could wipe entire cities off the map. I could have easily had it out with him right there, but I was not about to ruin my own good time.

He stays there the rest of the night, and when the reception ends we send the kids to load up in the limo with a few bridesmaids. I don’t even want to get in the limo at this point and am about to call a Lyft, but they let me know this guy isn’t the driver from earlier, so I decide to just take the limo we paid a stupid amount of money for back to the hotel. As I approach I see that it’s the same guy I went off on, and realize he must be the owner. I tell him I realize he’s not the same driver so apologize for telling him off earlier, but let him know I am very upset and we will need to talk about what happened. He lets me know he accidentally deleted my credit card info and needs a card to charge for the remaining balance. I tell him I’m not dealing with that right now and he’s going to have to call me tomorrow to sort it out. He takes us back and then returns for another group, and everyone who drove themselves there drives themselves back.

He texted me the next day (Sunday), that he apologizes for the confusion and to please call him to settle the balance, and leaves me a voicemail asking for a call back, but I am with family so not dealing with this. 

It is now Monday morning and y’all, I do not want to pay this man the remaining balance. I have given him a $150 deposit and the MANDATORY $220 cash tip (I had already handed off the envelope to my coordinator) and still owe $950, but I do not feel like I got the actual services I contracted for. My plan is to tell this guy to go screw himself and let him know that if he truly thinks he’s entitled to the remaining balance he can take me to small claims court, but at that point he better be ready for me to countersue him for all of the damages like alternate transportation costs and the costs to redo our couples photography including hair and makeup.

So WIBTA? I’m getting on a call with my coordinator in a few hours to go over the limo situation (so he’s created more work for her, too!), but I feel like I’m being more than fair to him.

25,1ft0r1f,AITA for not going to my friends middle school graduation ,"This is my first post so idk how to do this anyways I’m a F(17) with severe anxiety and my friend, F(15) had raging anger issues. We meet from our mothers because they were best friends in high school. ANYWAYS this story is very long but i’ll cut it short, as the day of her graduation was coming up, she asked me if i could go to her party in jersey (we both live in philly) but i still said ofc ill go but she also wanted my friends to also go (my friends were her friends but she meet them through me, they only hanged out couple of times) i asked my friends and they needed a ride there so i said they could ride with me. As the day comes, i woke up with a panic attack for no reason, i was throwing up and shaking from my anxiety and i tried to push through it but my mother told me not to go bc the party was also a pool party. I ended up texting my friend letting her know i can’t make it and my friends either bc i was their ride.

27,1ft0css,AITA for offering to walk an inebriated girl to the bathroom?,"
So my husband and I(27f) were out playing pool. There was a group of like 3 guys and 1 girl next to us being super loud. The girl was being loud and obnoxious. At one point she yelled to a guy she was with asking where the bathroom was, he was explaining but nobody offered to take her. Again this table was super loud and you could tell she was not sober. She even walked into a kids party room and then laughed it off. Anyway back to the point after a  minute I walked over, said excuse me, they didn’t hear me I got louder said “hey, I could walk you to the bathroom if you’d want” just trying to be nice. I was sober and had been there a million times. She starts laughing and says no. I say ok and walk away. Then proceeded to talk crap about me and take my picture while pretending to take a selfie and someone with her yelled and called me a nosy little bitch. I was only trying to offer to walk her there bc 1 she didn’t know where it was and 2 she wasn’t sober. So AITA? Maybe I should have just minded my business and not even offered.

28,1ft031x,WIBTAH if I don't want my husbands friends to bring their dogs over to our house anymore?,"Just before anybody asks, no these are not service dogs they are pets.

I am just curious if I would be the asshole if I don't want my husbands friends to bring their dogs to our house anymore. I was not very comfortable from the get go with them bringing them over the very first time. 

The first time they brought their dogs over it was their big dog and little dog. Their big dog is long haired and I am still finding hair in my curtains, in and on the couch after cleaning the cushions and lint rolling it top to bottom. In my favorite chair.
Both dogs were all over our couches. The little one peed on our floors which I found after they had left. There's even hair all over the inside of my truck I still can't seem to get rid of.  

They'll ask us if they can come over and that's cool with us but they never tell us when they are bringing the dogs. So whenever they get here and let their dogs in the house it's very awkward because I just expected them not the dogs too.

This last time they brought both of their little dogs over and washed them a bit outside since they were dirty which is fine but then they took them to the master bathroom and started giving them flea treatments and a flea bath. They did both dogs in our bathroom one at a time. Multiple times I had to run the first little dog off of our bed because she was still wet. This morning I have found some live fleas in my bed and on my baby and I. We haven't had fleas in this house until they were here and giving their dogs flea treatments. (Husband said they could use our bathroom without my knowledge)

After they gave their dogs a bath they were partially dried and back up on my couches. They stayed for a while and left and I noticed a live fleas on the couch as well. Which was kinda unnerving. I welcome husbands friends I just don't like it when they bring their dogs. Months ago I had a senior cat and he absolutely hated their dogs too, the first little dog always tried to mess with him. (Cat had no fleas, he was combed and treated on a regular basis from the day we got him to make sure there were no fleas)

UPDATE: After husband got home from work we had a serious talk.
(Husbands side)
He picked them up since they wanted to come hang out, and they asked if they could bring their dogs to which husband said yes. Later down the road they asked if they could bathe and flea bath them, he also said yes. They claimed they couldn't use the water spicket outside because ""the waters too cold for my babies"" and then came inside. Husband said they could use master bathroom since that's the only working bathtub. This was what husband said they asked and he approved before even asking if I was cool with it.

We called j & JJ and talked with them about this, about how we now have fleas in our house that now are a threat to my baby. About how it wasn't cool to let their dogs on my furniture ESPECIALLY our beds! We told them no more bringing pets over to our house because there's usually some mess I've had to deal with. Told them about the live fleas I found on me and the baby, the dog hair in my sink (I don't even know how it got there but there was dog hair in my sink), there were hundreds of dead fleas left in the bathtub, I had to change my sheets because there was a wet dog in them, how I am going to have to wash my couch cushions again and just how pissed I am. I am pissed that they knowingly brought this infestation into our house and put all of us at risk ESPECIALLY our young baby!

29,1fsznfc,AITA: Told my mum to stop buying us so many Christmas presents ,"Bit of background. My mum definitely has some form of shopping addiction—we have never been a wealthy family and my mum has had herself in thousands of debt over the years due to her shoppin. As kids we used to have christmases where you wouldn’t be able to see the floor for presents—and when me and my sister were little, this was obviously the most exciting thing ever as we had no idea the general costs of life and how much money would have been spent etc; even as a broke uni student I was grateful for a big old pile of gifts that usually had a few things I could use amongst it.

The problem here is I’m now 31, and me and my sister (29) plus her partner (30) have requested to our mum multiple times over the past few years to please stop spending so much on us. I tried to explain today that for my sister’s partner it can be uncomfortable as for him and his family presents have never been a huge part of Christmas, and that as we’re all adults with our own income none of us have anything that we either want nor need. I said that she should respect that request and her response was that we know what she is like by now and that she isn’t going to change. 

 I understand the joy that gift giving can bring, I enjoy giving a gift to my closest friends etc at Christmas time myself, but when it’s so excessive and numerous despite our requests it just becomes frustrating and moreso like she just enjoys shopping and doesn’t really put much thought into the gifts themselves. On top of that, when I have tried to be practical and said okay well I am saving up for something so a really good gift for me would be some money towards that, she won’t accept that and doesn’t want to give money because that’s a ‘crap’ gift. Alternatively I have said okay well I have racked my brain for something I wouldn’t normally treat myself to and I would like a bottle of perfume then, she won’t accept that that is all I want. A £70-£100 bottle of perfume is not the only thing I’m allowed for Christmas and I just don’t understand why.

It makes me feel really ungrateful and I very much dislike that because I am not and I appreciate every gift, but it feels more like they come from a sense of an excuse to spend money rather than because she actually wants to gift us something thoughtful or useful. I have said to her that id much rather she use the money she was going to spend on me to pay towards her next holiday, or on my youngest sister who is disabled and needs more expensive things regularly, or even to get ahead on some of the debts she still has but she won’t have it—she genuinely seemed baffled today when she said ‘so if there wasn’t any presents on Christmas Day you’d be alright with that?’ and I answered yes! I just want to have a nice calm Christmas with good food and my family and no drama for once. Apparently that’s too much to ask, but £1000+ on gifts isn’t?

32,1fsymsg,AITA for refusing to plan my wife's diet?,"My wife is obese. She's been like that for most of her life. A few years back she went on a diet made by a professional and lost a lot of weight in 2 years a healthy, steady way by controlling the calorie intake. She then stopped this diet because she though she got the hang of it and immediately gained the weight back. Her obesity is her major struggle in life, she brings this up quite often. I accept her the way she is, but she already has health issues stemming from her obesity and we're just in our early 30s. I want to help her be more healthy. 

She found out some time ago that that she has insulin resistance and that requires a specific diet. She does not follow the recommendations, though. I feel like I'm the one who is more serious about it, as I'm doing the reading and trying to find out how to help her. I offered that I can cook the meals for her (I do most of the cooking/grocery shopping anyway), but she needs to do the research about proper diet for her and plan the menu - I will do the rest (shopping and cooking). 

She got very angry and told me that she doesn't want this, because if I want to help, I should help all the way through, and not impose conditions under which I will help. She also absolutely refuses to count calories, claiming that she will start being more active and that will be enough (even though calorie counting 100% worked for her in the past). I currently feel that if I don't make sure to buy only stuff that she can eat, she doesn't give a damn about the culinary restrictions she should follow. Her obesity has been her struggle for most of her life, but for some reason she refuses to do a deep dive into the topic - there are so many resources that she could use. She could even find her old recipe books and just tell me the recipes, but she doesn't want to do this.

I really want to help her, but it's getting to the point where I'm behaving as if I was the one who obese and had insulin resistance, not her. I want to help, but I feel like she should be more involved, I can't do all the work for her.

Thanks everyone for suggesting what could work, but speaking from experience, she does not want to take advice regarding weight loss.

Lots of people recommend therapy - she’s been to therapy for the last few years but it was not primarily about weight loss. She recently ended the therapy and I’m hoping she will have more head space to focus on the lifestyle changes as other areas of her life have seen improvement.

Recently, she has finally sought out mental health help and is doing so much better. I am so incredibly happy for her. She has even made friends with a group of women in our area. She's been going out with them, or going over to their places, but really would like to have them over to our house. I obviously agreed that this is a great idea. 

The issue is, she would like to have one of these women over at 8pm this Wednesday to watch a movie. That's a little tough for me because that's a work night for me and school night for our two young daughters, but I agreed on one condition. That condition being that they stay in the living room/kitchen area and she not bring her into our room. My reason being that I want to be free to go to bed whenever I want, and I want to be able to have a private spot to exist and relax before bed. Also, my youngest often has trouble sleeping and her being able to come lay with me when she gets scared is important to both her and I. Well...apparently, I'm being unreasonable. A couple of things my wife has in common with this woman is computer gaming and guitar, the set ups for which both are in our bedroom. I understand why not having access to the bedroom is inconvenient...but, it would also inconvenient to me as I have to get up at 5 am to get ready for work and to get our kids ready for school. If she ever invites her back on a non school night, I'd be happy to allow her in the room. The other thing is...the plan is to watch a movie and they're not even starting til 8. I don't see why they can't plan video games and guitar on another night.

But, my wife hasn't stopped pouting. Saying I'm never on her side and I'm not rooting for her to finally have friends. Which is incorrect. I've been pushing for 13 years for her to make friends, helping and encouraging in any way I can. I just want peace, quiet, and privacy in my own bedroom on a work and school night. I understand it's her room too, so maybe I am being unreasonable? I don't know.

35,1fsxx1e,AITA for calling my BIL a giant man baby?,"My sister has been married twice. With her ex-husband she has a 10 year old daughter and an 8 year old son. She is currently expecting a baby (6ish months along) with her current/second husband. Second husband is BIL mentioned in the post.

My sister and her ex-husband's marriage ended during her second pregnancy in reality. They were together for several more months in an effort to make it work but they were never really in love (I believe this is somewhat relevant later) and I don't think they ever really liked each other but both loved the children they shared. The marriage ended and my sister started dating soon after. She met BIL a year after her divorce was finalized. At this point the kids were 3.5 and 1.5.

Problems began when my sister and BIL moved in together after 6 months of dating. BIL did not like seeing the kids dad around. The kids dad would pick them up for his custody time, would show up to preschool plays and meetings. Then BIL got annoyed one day when he found out my parents had run into the kids dad and spoken to him at random. He said nothing for ages after my parents mentioned it. Months and maybe even more than a year later when I think back on it, he brought it up and told us all how offended he was that we were still friendly with the kids dad and he said this in front of the kids. When my sister and BIL got married he became visibly frustrated when the kids wanted to invite their dad. He wasn't invited. But he was annoyed that a 4 and 6 year old wanted their dad there.

BIL has this one-sided and self-inflicted competition going on with the kids dad for the role as their dad. He has tried encouraging the kids to call him dad, has asked my sister to go to court and get Father's Day split/shared or alternated in some way so he can have them too. I believe my sister allows this because BIL is the first man she has been in love with. And she's letting it blind her.

BIL complains frequently that the kids treat him like a stranger or like a teacher they have to respect but don't like.

Yesterday was my other sister's birthday and we were at her house. My sister's kids were telling me about their dad and what was going on with him when BIL demanded to speak with me and tore me a new one for disrespecting him with talk of ""the competition"". He told me HE is my sister's husband and the kids real dad and I should stop the disrespect. I told him to quit being such a man baby and accept that he has stepkids and they have a loving father and that others are allowed to be on good terms with their father. He called me some names and said I owed him a lot more respect then I was showing him by saying that to his face.

37,1fsxgbj,AITA for refusing to help my friend with her paperwork and not apologizing when she got upset?,"
I need some advice on a situation with my best friend. We’ve been close for about a year, and we’re a group of four (one of us is a guy) who all study at the same university.
My best friend is in another city, and she asked the second friend in our group if she could help her with some paperwork related to her studies by delivering it to the administration for her. The second friend refused, and then she asked me. I told her I couldn’t help because I have social anxiety and wasn’t able to speak with the person who had her papers. I also wasn’t sure how I would deliver them, especially because the person kept asking me about it, and responding would be difficult for me because I have social anxiety. 
A few hours later, I messaged her to ask if she found someone else to help, and I offered to help if she still needed it. But by then, she was upset and said that we didn’t care about her or her future, and then she left the group chat.
I tried to call and message her, but she hasn’t responded. I feel like she overreacted, and if I were in her position, I’d be upset, but I wouldn’t have ended the friendship over it. The boy from our group ended up helping her.

38,1fsxfpi,AITA for looking in his Laptop?,"My husband (37) and I have (35) been together for 15 years. I helped him at school, with all his canceled studies, with his drug-addicted parents, who really destroyed him and me emotionally, his siblings not wanting to have any contact to him, losing his grandparents etc. 

After breaking off contact with his parents, he bought an apartment for us. He then had severe depression for 5 years, which came about as a result of breaking off contact. I read up on the subject and tried to help and support where I could, because he didn't want to do therapy. During that time he said a lot of unpleasant things and often threatened to leave me. I always tried to differentiate and tell myself that this was his illness. I listened to him and tried to support him, even if I didn't always do the right thing. I got into gaming to support him, wrote him little messages with reasons, why he deserves Love and all those little things and yes i set him under pressure to end one of his studies, which was not right. Yes, i did a lot wrong, but i am not a therapist. One time a guy at work was flirting with me and i liked it to Hear, that i'm a nice women. I told a friend of mine and my husband read our conversation on Instagram, i admitted that i was wrong and i m really sorry about that. But in every other situation i swear i just respond to guys, how much i love my husband.

At some point things couldn't go on like this anymore and I told him a year ago that he should only do things that are good for him. He started fishing again and hanging out with his friends a lot, gave up his job to focus on himself and I support that and finance everything, which is not a problem for me, because i don't care about money in a relationship and i earn more than enough for both of us. He always loved a little boat for fishing so i said, we should get it and he payed half of it and i pay for the other half. 

However, I have to admit that the very loveless period of depression really sticks with me now that he is feeling a little better and I would like a lot of confirmation from him regarding the relationship, which I have also told him. I don't need presents, but i need emotional support, some little love messages from time to time. And since he is getting better, he warms up to me a little.

Unfortunately he doesn't sleep with me anymore for three years, even though I tried really EVERYTHING and tried to talk to him. I also cosplayed as his favourite gaming characters. First i claimed it to the depression and i tryed to be very understanding. He rejects me everytime and becomes very unfriendly.

We have always had our smartphone and laptop passwords and since our conversations never amounted to anything and I'm worried about our relationship, I was a piece of shit and was on his laptop. Of course I found sexual things that I didn't want to find and that are too private(he is Not having an affair).

It all changed though when one day Winona told me she had caught her old sister Emma drinking. Emma and Winona had no relationship and honestly it was sad. When she told me about it I was shocked but what shocked me most was the fact that Emma was also vaping. I thought nothing of it and promised I wouldn’t tell anyone. Fast forward to that summer Winona had gotten closer to Emma. They were like best friends now. They hung out with shady guys stayed up all night and their parents didn’t seem to care. Then that one sleepover changed everything. I was staying up at Winona’s boat house and we decided to go into the forest with Emma and Judith(Emma’s friend) Winona had a friend named Bea happened to live near the boat house. We met up with Bea and she happened to be a family friend. Winona started joking about how bad my grades were, how my Spanish was bad and I was honestly getting upset. Then Winona fell and as I thought me were joking I said “Wow gravity can still hold your weight”. Winona didn’t seem to get upset and she laughed at it to. Then when Bea had gone it was Me, Winona, Emma and Judith. We were sitting at a campfire when Judith handed me a full vape. She told me should would give it to me this once for free. I said that I didn’t want to and that made Winona upset. Winona told me how evil I had been to her that day joking about her weight. I explained that I was only joking and it made me feel guilty as I didn’t want her to think of me that way. Winona then called me a pussy and told me to take a puff. I struggled on what to do so I took a puff. I didn’t really like it and decided to go to bed. In the morning Winona, Emma and Judith were gone. I called Winona multiple times but she didn’t pick up. I called my mum to come pick me up and she did. School then started and Winona won’t talk to me. The weird thing is Judith still talks to me as if nothing happened.

Fast forward to that summer Winona had gotten closer to Emma. They were like best friends now. They hung out with shady guys stayed up all night and their parents didn’t seem to care. Then that one sleepover changed everything. I was staying up at Winona’s boat house and we decided to go into the forest with Emma and Judith(Emma’s friend) Winona had a friend named Bea happened to live near the boat house. We met up with Bea and she happened to be a family friend. Winona started joking about how bad my grades were, how my Spanish was bad and I was honestly getting upset. Then Winona fell and as I thought me were joking I said “Wow gravity can still hold your weight”. Winona didn’t seem to get upset and she laughed at it to. Then when Bea had gone it was Me, Winona, Emma and Judith. We were sitting at a campfire when Judith handed me a full vape. She told me should would give it to me this once for free. I said that I didn’t want to and that made Winona upset. Winona told me how evil I had been to her that day joking about her weight. I explained that I was only joking and it made me feel guilty as I didn’t want her to think of me that way. Winona then called me a pussy and told me to take a puff. I struggled on what to do so I took a puff. I didn’t really like it and decided to go to bed. In the morning Winona, Emma and Judith were gone. I called Winona multiple times but she didn’t pick up. I called my mum to come pick me up and she did. School then started and Winona won’t talk to me. The weird thing is Judith still talks to me as if nothing happened. I have apologised multiple times but she doesn’t want to talk to me so,

41,1fsw4ha,AITA for getting my friend in trouble at school after he joked about my mums cancer?,"my mum (44) was diagnosed with cancer recently and most of my friends know now since I live in a small town so I guess parents talk. some of my mates (all 16) came over to my (16m) house for something and there wasnt anyone home because my brother (22) and my mum were at the clinic. I guess they noticed this because in the past when they would come to my house my mum would usually be there because she works at night. in particular one of my mates tom asked and I just told all of them what happened.

even though I was sure most of them knew already they did look sorry. but tom didn't really get it I guess and said ""does that mean she'll start chemo"", I said yeah and tom kind of made this joke, ""well hope your mums still fit (hot) after she loses all that hair""

tom is always like this in the sense that he always makes insensitive jokes and I knew he was joking but I got really mad and told him to shut up. we shouted at each other for a while and the rest of them thought it would be better to just cancel the meetup and go home.

after a few days I heard tom was telling people that my mum had cancer like people that I barely knew and he just kept spreading it. I dont know how true this part is but I also heard he says that my brother had to work 2 jobs to support us since my dads not really around and I told him that in private. I asked him to stop it and he said that almost everyone knew already so there was no point and he was just telling the truth when they asked him.

tom hasnt apologised but hes trying to ignore that it ever happened and talks to me as usual. some of my friends think tom really shouldn't have said that but a few have told me to just suck it up and not be mad anymore or else itll just make stuff more awkward. when I told my brother he told me not to apologise and  offered to write a note to our form head or something. at that point I was really angry so I just agreed.

after I complained to my form head tom was pulled out of class and I didnt hear what happened but after he came back he looked pissed and ignored me for the rest of the day. the next day he walked up to me and told me to stop being so sensitive and that I didn't have to lodge a formal complaint against him.

I dont know if Ive just blown this out of proportion because now our circle of friends is all really awkward and nobody really wants to acknowledge it. a few of them told me to just move on and told me that I really shouldn't have gotten him in trouble like that",Not the A-hole,2024-09-30,"AITA for getting my friend in trouble at school after he joked about my mums cancer? my mum (44) was diagnosed with cancer recently and most of my friends know now since I live in a small town so I guess parents talk. some of my mates (all 16) came over to my (16m) house for something and there wasnt anyone home because my brother (22) and my mum were at the clinic.

We’ve been through a lot and consider ourselves a strong couple with a good relationship. We are both neurodivergent; I work full time and he is a full time student, and we share the load pretty well in caring for our toddler when she’s not in daycare. The issue is when I work. I work full time in the food and bev industry, often covering shifts if I’m needed. What tends to happen is, on my off days, I’m doing most of the chores; vacuuming, dishes, etc. I don’t mind; it’s my house too and it part of my responsibility. The issue comes in when my husband is on toddler duty. He tends to have a difficult time balancing chores and toddler, so chores are often forgotten or neglected. This is understandable, but my frustration starts when I ask him to do a specific chore and it doesn’t done by the time I need it to be. For example; I’ll ask him to switch a load of laundry out so I can have clean clothes for work the next day. I run out for an errand, come back, and the chore isn’t done. This happens regardless of if there is a toddler in the house he is responsible for taking care of. 

Today, on our drive to drop him and the tiny monarch to school, we had a conversation in which I admitted to not believing him when he said he would help. His response was; “you didn’t even ask for help.” The things is, I did, I do. However it doesn’t make sense to rely on someone for something you know has a 50% chance of being completed or not.

When I asked if he had anything he wanted to say; his response was, “I’m trying to think of a tactful way to say this.” He then left the car (we’d arrived at his college by this time) after giving me a goodbye kiss, and we haven’t talked since. 

I’m anxious that he is upset with me for being honest about how I feel, and even more upset that I feel this way.

I (16F) live with my parents, older brother (26M), and older sister (25F). Recently, there’s been tension in our family because my parents took out a loan to help my siblings get back on their feet during COVID. Instead of using the money responsibly, my sister gave half to her ex-boyfriend, and my brother wasted his on alcohol and substances. Neither has paid back a cent, even though the loan was meant to help them out of a rough patch.

My dad often threatens to take legal action to get the money back, but my mom—who came up with the idea—keeps telling them not to worry and to focus on ""getting back on their feet."" But it’s been years, and nothing has changed.

The other day, I was outside with my two nieces (my sister’s daughters) when the ice cream truck came by. We ran inside to ask my mom for money, and she gave us $20. My nieces bought ice cream, and I got a small bag of candies. When we came back in, I overheard my sister complaining to my mom, saying, “I get it for the girls, but why are you giving her money? She’s 16, she should have her own.”

That really bothered me, so I went back inside, gave my mom the change, and said to my sister, “You can’t complain about me when you haven’t even paid back the loan or taken care of your kids.” My sister got mad, but I didn’t care. I turned to my mom and asked, “You’re really letting her talk about me like that?” My mom just shook her head and walked away.

Later, my mom twisted the story when my dad got home, saying I insulted my sister for no reason. I told him the truth, but now I’m worried I made things worse. The next morning, I overheard my dad on the phone with a lawyer, and I’m pretty sure it was about the loan.

My brother, who drives me to work, said there’s been a lot of tension in the house. I explained what happened, and that evening, my dad shook my brother’s hand. My brother had paid back half of what he owed from the loan and promised to pay off the rest soon. When my dad looked at my sister, she got defensive and said she couldn’t afford it and had been “too busy.” My dad just shook his head and walked away.

44,1fsv64k,AITA for not caring as much as my girlfriend that I gained weight?,"I’m (M23) a model in New York. When I was 19, I had gotten an awesome contract opportunity and moved to NYC basically living my dream job. I’ve been dating my girlfriend (F23) for 2 years now, but we’ve been friends for longer, so she knew this was my dream. Now I’m working freelance modeling.

In the last year, I’ve gained a little bit of weight. Nothing outrageous, but I don’t have abs anymore, and I have a bit of a gut now. I’m 6’1 and weighed about 160, but now weigh around 190. I think it’s probably related that I’ve also gotten significantly less modeling gigs in the last year. To compensate for the lack of income, I got a part-time job hosting in a restaurant.

A couple of nights ago, my girlfriend had a conversation with me about my weight gain, the first time we’ve really talked about it. She was concerned that I was giving up my dream by letting myself go, and didn’t want me to see me get a full-on beer belly. I’ve honestly been happy just working the hosting job, it’s less stressful and I have more of a consistent schedule. I told her this, but she said that I was suppressing and giving up when I didn’t have to. I told her that I didn’t care that I gained weight and that she shouldn’t comment on my body. She kept pushing that I should care a little bit more. I then said that she just missed my model body, and she got hurt by that, saying that I was accusing her of being shallow.

We’re kind of in a stand off after that conversation. I don’t think I fully believe her that she’s truly just looking out for my dreams. Am I the asshole for not caring?

  
INFO: My girlfriend was already in NYC when I started dating her. She loves New York but I think probably would have left by now for finance reasons if it wasn’t for my modeling career. 

INFO: I gained most of the weight in just over the last year. I’m 193 lbs now, and the weight has settled as a bit of a gut and a love handles situation. It’s mostly a result of gym less and beer. ",No A-holes here,2024-09-30,"AITA for not caring as much as my girlfriend that I gained weight? I’m (M23) a model in New York.

My stepsister (14F) and I share the same birthday. I have a stepbrother (10M) too but he doesn't share the same birthday. Because my stepsister's birthday is the same day as mine, my mom and her husband insisted that we celebrate our birthdays together every year and do a joint thing. I asked my mom to do it separate but she said it was more affordable and let them go all out for us. I asked my dad if I could still have parties when I was with him and he said sure. So at mom's house I never asked for a party and just went along with whatever while dad's house was where the real celebration happened.

This year my mom and her husband took us to some spa place for the birthday celebration and brought us out to eat afterward. They said celebrating with family was the best way to celebrate birthdays. That was 2 weeks ago.

Dad threw the party for me Saturday. But it was a sleepover and a party in one. My best friends and I went to this VR gaming arcade and spent a few hours there and then we went back to dad's and had lots of food and snacks and played video games pretty much all night long. It was the best.

Mom came to pick me up yesterday when one of my friends was leaving and she heard them say thanks for the invite and stuff. Mom saw the balloons dad put out too. Then she asked on the way to her house if I had a party and I said I always do. She said I never ask her to throw a big party when I celebrate at her house. I told her I save that stuff for dad's since it's just about me and I don't have to share with her stepdaughter. She told me I should invite my stepsiblings then. I told her I don't want to. That it's bad enough sharing the celebration at her house but I won't do it at dad's and I told her they're not my friends, I don't WANT to spend time with them, I just have to.

Mom's husband was pissed when he heard. Then my stepbrother was upset that he missed out because he loves video games and never gets to play them all night. My mom lectured me for like an hour last night about it.

This year my mom and her husband took us to some spa place for the birthday celebration and brought us out to eat afterward. They said celebrating with family was the best way to celebrate birthdays. That was 2 weeks ago.

Dad threw the party for me Saturday. But it was a sleepover and a party in one. My best friends and I went to this VR gaming arcade and spent a few hours there and then we went back to dad's and had lots of food and snacks and played video games pretty much all night long. It was the best.

Mom came to pick me up yesterday when one of my friends was leaving and she heard them say thanks for the invite and stuff. Mom saw the balloons dad put out too. Then she asked on the way to her house if I had a party and I said I always do. She said I never ask her to throw a big party when I celebrate at her house. I told her I save that stuff for dad's since it's just about me and I don't have to share with her stepdaughter. She told me I should invite my stepsiblings then. I told her I don't want to. That it's bad enough sharing the celebration at her house but I won't do it at dad's and I told her they're not my friends, I don't WANT to spend time with them, I just have to.

Mom's husband was pissed when he heard. Then my stepbrother was upset that he missed out because he loves video games and never gets to play them all night. My mom lectured me for like an hour last night about it.

49,1fsulci,AITA for calling my mum a selfish b*tch? ,"
I have fairly recently developed a neurological condition. I’ve completely lost my ability to walk, I’m weak & tired a lot. I have other issues like seizures, losing consciousness, serve pain etc..

My partner has been amazing, not only is he working two jobs to support us (I lost mine because of my health) he’s in Uni and he’s caring for me and taking care of our house & our daughter. But I feel it’s all too much for him and I’m worried about the impact it’s all having on him. 

I called my mum last night and told her that we’re really struggling; that my partner is doing too much and I’m worried about him. She said “I’m not sure what to suggest.” 
I asked directly if she’d be able to help, either physically by coming over and either helping me or helping my partner with housework or financially by helping us pay for some kind of help either carers or a cleaner. 

She said no, she said she isn’t able to help and suggested my partner quit one of his jobs. I explained that he can’t because we have a mortgage to pay & bills to pay. She made some sympathetic noises, but nothing else. 

Some background- My mum lives one town away, it’s literally a 15 minutes drive, she’s also relatively wealthy. To be fair to her she does work 8-5 Tuesday - Friday and her partner is struggling with poor health, however her partner has no mobility issues and doesn’t need care. I haven’t seen my mum in person for just over 2 months. The only thing she’s done for me through all this was have my daughter whilst I was in the hospital. 

I ended the call with my mum feeling crap about it all. On the way to going up to bed I collapsed and hurt my knee. I called my mum back once I was safely in bed and told her what happened, again she was sympathetic, but offered no help. I got frustrated and asked her why she won’t help us, she made excuses about work and being too busy. I snapped and told her that she’s always been a selfish bitch and ended the call. 

I feel guilty for my words & anger, but I also still believe that what I said is true. I’m torn: am I the asshole? ",Asshole,2024-09-30,"AITA for calling my mum a selfish b*tch?

54,1fstmvx,AITA for refusing to pay for my (19F) mom's (43F) credit card debt?,"So this literally just happened.

I (19F) just recently started my first full time job as a restaurant host. The pay is pretty good for someone like me who moved from part time to full time. My mom (53F) has been hopping around jobs for the last 2 ish years due to her age and declining energy and strength. Its also important to point out that we are a latino family (from brazil), so there's some aspects of culture at play. 

My family has never been good at saving money, from sending money to family overseas to hoping addresses every year or so. Finances aren't really a big priority to them. I on the other hand save as much as i can because i plan on starting university for vet surgery next year without needing to work on the side for at least the first year, so quite a lot of money i need to save. Not only that but my mom is set on going back to brazil in the next 3 months. For obvious reasons im staying in the uk, so theres the added cost of moving out either by myself or with a roommate.

Now onto the problem. 

About 2 months ago my mom, dad and lil brother went to brazil for a whole month. I was originally confused as to where my mom got the money for the plane tickets since still to this day we have about 3 different debts that dont include bills to settle. But i guess i got my answer today.

Turns out my mom used her already messed up credit card to pay for it.

I found this out by receiving a lovely text this morning from her, asking to send her £1,000 to pay off her cradit card debt. Saying my dad would send about £150 a month to oay me off.

This is where im wondering if im the asshole. £1k is currently over a third of my total savings. In terms of my contributions to the house, i pay for wifi and send her over £100 a month (depends on what she asks for) for food and other things. I also have a vehicle ive pay for completely by myself and currently paying 3.3k other 11 months for insurance on it so i do have financial responsibilities that eat up part of my paycheck every month.

I refused stating all of the above but did say i could help a little bit.

58,1fssydg,AITA Spouse called me a liar ,"I went with my husband to a sporting event. It was soccer. I haven't seen soccer at the university level before. It was hot and we were sitting in the sun. I was mad at myself for forgetting the sunblock. I used the program to cover up my legs but other than that it wasn't terrible. I asked my husband questions as the game progressed. The bleachers are a tight fit with all the fans and when I noticed that the couple next to the stairs had left I took the opportunity to take a bathroom break. On the way back I saw a friend of mine. I had mentioned to her about forgetting the sunblock. She didn't have any but gave me lotion since something is better than nothing. I return to the bleachers and start lathering the lotion, explaining to my husband how I got it. After about five minutes it was half time and my spouse said ""ready to go?"" In surprise, I said ""um ok sure."" On the way out I asked him why we were leaving and his answers were no. ""Are you too hot?"" ""No."" ""Are you bored?"" ""No."" I saw my friend again. She was surprised that I was leaving. She asked why and I said my husband wanted to leave. My husband looked at me and said ""You are lying."" I didn't know how to respond and just laughed it off. Later I told him how humiliating it was to be called a liar in front of someone else, especially when he was the one who wouldn't explain why we were leaving. He finally told me that we were leaving because I wasn't having fun. I asked him why he felt that way. He said it was just a vibe.

It was hot and we were sitting in the sun. I was mad at myself for forgetting the sunblock. I used the program to cover up my legs but other than that it wasn't terrible. I asked my husband questions as the game progressed. The bleachers are a tight fit with all the fans and when I noticed that the couple next to the stairs had left I took the opportunity to take a bathroom break. On the way back I saw a friend of mine. I had mentioned to her about forgetting the sunblock. She didn't have any but gave me lotion since something is better than nothing. I return to the bleachers and start lathering the lotion, explaining to my husband how I got it. After about five minutes it was half time and my spouse said ""ready to go?"" In surprise, I said ""um ok sure."" On the way out I asked him why we were leaving and his answers were no. ""Are you too hot?"" ""No."" ""Are you bored?"" ""No."" I saw my friend again. She was surprised that I was leaving. She asked why and I said my husband wanted to leave. My husband looked at me and said ""You are lying."" I didn't know how to respond and just laughed it off. Later I told him how humiliating it was to be called a liar in front of someone else, especially when he was the one who wouldn't explain why we were leaving. He finally told me that we were leaving because I wasn't having fun. I asked him why he felt that way. He said it was just a vibe.

59,1fssy8h,AITA for refusing to ask my grandparents to help my parents and siblings financially?,"I've (16M) lived with my grandparents for the last two years. They won custody over me after my parents left the state with my siblings for 3 nights but forgot me and when they remembered I wasn't with them they called me and said they would waste their time coming back to get me. This was not the first time this happened. My grandparents had documented several incidents of this happening and they had called CPS on my parents for stuff like this before. So my grandparents won custody over me and I moved in with them.

I'm in therapy with my parents. Unfortunately, it's court ordered and the judge won't let it end until I'm 18. So I still have one day every week where I see them for about an hour. I don't see my siblings anymore.

Some other background info before getting to the point so you'll see why this is a big deal. I'm the middle child and got the stereotypical deal of being looked over a lot and ignored more than my older or younger siblings. My siblings joked about me being unloved a lot and they'd say things were better without me there and how they knew is nobody ever noticed me missing stuff until the end. My younger siblings would always call me gay and girly as an insult. My older siblings would say our parents were forced to adopt me and that's why they always forgot me and didn't love me. My parents never said a thing when my siblings would say stuff like that in front of me. My parents never remembered my favorite food, my birthday, gifts for Christmas, my PT conferences and all kinds of stuff. They never forgot those things for my siblings.

Whenever we spent time with extended family my parents would bring up this ""funny story"" about leaving me in the cart at the supermarket when I was a baby and driving away before someone reminded them about me. I was 10 weeks old.

My parents used to complain if anyone in our family gave me gifts that looked bigger or more expensive than what they gave my siblings. 

So anyway, I live with my grandparents now and I'm way happier. My grandparents told me they'll help me through college or a trade or whatever I want to do after high school and they spoil me. Which my parents and siblings know about and hate. My parents got into financial issues about a month ago and asked my grandparents for a loan. My grandparents said no and refused to help them. They also refused to send anything to help my siblings. At my therapy appointment two weeks ago my parents asked me to speak to my grandparents and ask them to help. I said no and I followed through. My parents brought it up again at the next appointment and when I said I hadn't asked they called me selfish and they told me I should care more about my younger siblings and doing good by them. They told me I'm willing to let them suffer because I was ignored but I was never in the bad situation they are.

My husband and I both work full time, and have had our LO in fulltime nursery for the past few months. This completely eats up his salary but hey, we're a unit and we make it work (I'm the breadwinner). 

My mum has been away and is now back in the country - she's offered to look after our twenty month old once a week. That and the 15 hours childcare we're now eligible for (UK) has made a massive difference - it halves our childcare costs 

Question: my mum and LO *adore* each other, but she's far more hands off than I would be. Like we worked out last week that she left her up a floor last week while our daughter played on a rowing machine alone (🫠) or she'll let her go down the stairs instructing her from above (so she can't catch her) in her second language to 'be careful and turn around'. Or even feed her whole nuts and completely ignore our messaging to the effect that while she's a good eater she's also way too young for that. 

Any attempt to correct her is met with complete resistance 'you need to let her be free' and 'shes very sensible/careful'. She also seems unable to plan ahead for mealtimes or nap times, meaning we're constantly micromanaging the schedule. As my husband says - she's saved us money but not effort or time. And we obviously could not begin to forgive ourselves if something went wrong and we were aware (as we are) that her parenting was less careful than ours. 

Question is, what do we do? We're in the fortunate position that we can economically make it work either way, although paying one less day of childcare is of course welcomed. I really want to safeguard the relationship between my mum and my daughter, but of course my daughter's safety is paramount. Currently we just don't fully trust them to be alone in the house together (oddly, I'm more comfortable when they're out and about, as I think my mum is sufficiently aware of stranger/car/external factor danger to be far more careful than she is in her own very adult-friendly, sharp angled and full-of-stairs house). 

Are my expectations too high?
Do we solutionise for her (eg buy a playpen and read her the riot act re leaving her unsupervised/following solid starts guidance etc)
Do we just put her back into nursery?!",Not the A-hole,2024-09-30,"AITA for expecting my mother to always be in the same room as our 20 month toddler when babysitting? Keen for views - genuinely.

My husband and I both work full time, and have had our LO in fulltime nursery for the past few months. This completely eats up his salary but hey, we're a unit and we make it work (I'm the breadwinner). 

My mum has been away and is now back in the country - she's offered to look after our twenty month old once a week. That and the 15 hours childcare we're now eligible for (UK) has made a massive difference - it halves our childcare costs

68,1fsq5mu,AITA for turning a Wedding Dress into a Cosplay rather than letting my Cousin have it for her wedding?,"I (27F) am an avid cosplayer, my girlfriend (28F) and I go to all conventions we can and have a lot of fun making our costumes together and prepping for the year. Three Months ago I, my girlfriend, and my cousin (30F) went around charity shops looking for pieces we could turn into cosplays. My cousin isn't a cosplayer but she tagged along as she likes a good bargain hunt. In the third shop we went to we found in the window an old school wedding dress, it had a few stains and minor rips but all in all was in good condition. 

My Girlfriend and I joked with my cousin that she should buy it for her wedding but she turned her nose up at it stating she wanted brand new and she'd not be caught dead in an old fashioned dress. We let it go and my Girlfriend was the one to point out to me if we did some alterations it'd be a perfect dupe for Sarah's ballgown in Jim Hensons Labyrinth which is our favourite movie. I realised she was right and asked her if she wanted to make this our next major matching costume. She agreed for the convention season of 2025 we will be Jareth and Sarah. 

I bought the dress and my cousin made a few jokes about it but we heard nothing back from her, not until two days ago. I've been posting progress of my dress on social media and it's finally done and looks amazing. My cousin told me she'd not found a dress she likes and i've done wonders with this dress, that she'd changed her mind and she'd be happy to meet the price i'd paid (£150) and even throw in an extra £100 for my time fixing it up. I laughed and asked if she was joking, she told me she was deadly serious and I told her that wasn't happening. This led to a fight and I was getting annoyed, my girlfriend took the phone at this point and told her she had her chance to get the dress, and that it's a cosplay now not a wedding dress. 

We've since been bombarded by my family trying to get in contact, some pleading, some trying to cajole and others straight up berating us for not letting my cousin buy the dress or even better yet being a good cousin and *gifting* it to her, that I shouldn't turn a charity shop wedding dress into a costume as it stopped brides who really needed it having it.

I'm getting stressed and upset with this and my girlfriend is currently fielding any calls we get and telling them off for upsetting me. She's a wonder and I am so grateful to have her with me for this.

AITA though? I am starting to worry because of the widespread reaction.

69,1fspqb3,AITA for not keeping in regular contact with my father after we reconnected?,"I (19M) have lived with my mother for all my life up until last year, which I moved out for university. A few years ago, when I was 14 or 13, I cannot remember, I reconnected with my father after the insistance of my family. My father and mother have divorced when I was a young child, and ever since he left I have not talked to him until that point, and even now l've only seen him in real life once and that was on my birthday two years ago.

I do not keep in regular contact with my father- a small reason for it is spite, but a major big reason is the fact that I simply got used to the fact that I have not had a father. My brother (17M), however, keeps in regular contact weekly.

Recently, my brother had some medical issues, and since he is on my father's insurance, we tried getting him help that way and we ran into some problems, which then my mother asked me to talk to my father about it. I kept relaying messages between them, back and forth, until my mother, my brother, and 1, went into a store to get some groceries. I was pushing the shopping cart while my brother leaned on me because he was dizzy, and during that time I got called by my father, which I didn't notice due to how busy I was.

Twenty minutes passed since then, and my father messaged me that I was an ungrateful child, and that leaving him on read wnd ignoring him was an asshole move. He also added that one day when I have children, I will understand what he is saying.

Now, I responded back because I did not like having misunderstandings, and explained to him my situation- which he proceeded to leave me on read after.

I am conflicted about this, because he himself has said he will not attend my highschool graduation because he isn't allowed in my town- and when I asked him about going to my university graduation, he said he won't either because he doesn't like the region I grew up in, so I thought it was a mutual understanding that him and I are biologically related and nothing more.

I told my friends about it, and they said it was disrespectful leaving him on read, and while the way he handled it was rude, he has a right to be angry. My girlfriend, however, thinks I am in the right and it was about time for him to realize that the way he treated me and our relationship is despicable.

I had started distancing myself from Hannah and Sabrina after my relationship with my ex and I split up and neither of them liked that I had introduced them to each other because they both meant a lot to me and I thought why not. They started to not like how much time I spent talking to my partner and that I was distancing myself from them. My ex was a bad person and they both knew that and when I left they were basically smothering me and I needed space to feel my feelings and start healing some because they brought it up a lot. They ended up pulling a prank on me about abuse that I did find funny I ended up trying to forgive them and couldn't yet. I ended up with contact with Sabrina again after a while but I couldn't bring myself to talk to Hannah. Her and my partner had gotten into it and she made up lies and fake accounts to try and get him to cheat then only send me screenshots of certain parts of the conversation.

Sabrina let Caleb have her phone and he messaged the group chat saying some things like how I can't even defend myself against my ex what makes me think I could protect anyone else.

71,1fspana,AITA for wanting to break my neighbor off a piece of my mind about their dog neglect?,"
They already have a less than a year old husky puppy.  It stays in the backyard pretty much 24/7, with little to no interaction unless they are outside with it for a couple hours a week here and there.  Not my idea of pet ownership.  But at the same time not criminal.

Wife takes our dog out to potty this evening and tells me that there is a new puppy next door by seeing what our dog was sniffing at by the fence we share with them.  

One of our boys is leaving for a school camping trip tomorrow.  And I ran out after dinner to get batteries for the flashlight they wanted to bring with them.  As I go to open my car door I get licked on the ankle by this softball sized puppy.

I go to the neighbor’s door, activate their ring doorbell and am ask if it’s their dog.  It is, they got it this morning, but they left it out in the backyard around noon to go watch football somewhere.  

“The gate is unlocked, just put it back in the backyard.  It’ll be fine.”

So I put it back there, but I used some bag chairs I found and an empty trash can to try to cover the gap at the bottom of the wooden gate.  Seems to work.  

45 min later, I go out to wheel our trashcan down to the curb for pickup tomorrow.  Greeted by this little sweetheart again.  Called my wife out and we grabbed some landscaping rocks and our empty lawn/garden trashcan to try to shore up the front of their gate.  Seems to work.  

 Now it’s about 10 PM, and we hear banging and scratching at our front metal security door.  Hoped it was the neighbors coming to thank us and letting the puppy announce them.

No, it’s escaped for a third time.  At this point our dog is going nuts.  So we closed the front door and I went out the garage.  In those 30 seconds this dog squeezed between the 2 inch gap between our security door and front door and has scaled the metal screen to six feet off the ground, sandwiched between the two doors.

So we grabbed an old towel, and put it in the bed of the truck parked in their driveway with a small Tupperware container of water and a few little kibbles of our own dog’s food.  

I activated their fucking ring camera again to let them know where their brand new puppy is and wanted to let them fucking have it for being such shitty fucking owners.  I still want to, but they are neighbors and my wife doesn’t want me to stir the pot.  AITA for really wanting to be an asshole and stir that fucking pot.

TL;DR: I think my neighbors are shitty, neglectful pet owners and should have their fucking hair blown back by me about exactly why.  AITA or should I let bygones be ect ect ect.

72,1fsp4ar,AITA for not taking down the “gory and disturbing” pictures on the walls of my bathroom and then telling my niece about them?,"My (50M) husband (66M) and my SIL (42F) went to an event while I looked after my niece “Emily” (10F) until they came back for dinner. SIL and Emily stayed the night, and then they left yesterday morning. 

Emily is very curious and asks about everything she sees. I love answering her questions because I was the same as a child and I remember being frustrated when adults would refuse to answer me, saying I wouldn’t understand.

My husband and I are both autistic, and we share an obsession in art and art history, so we have art pieces lining the walls in every room of our house. Most of the ones we put in the bathroom are there to be ironic, and they depict people dying in some bath-related way.

After doing some exploring of the house, Emily asked about the paintings in the bathroom. I answered all her questions, telling her who the people were, what they did, why they were important, context of the surrounding events and time period, etc. So that you know what she was seeing, she was most interested in prints of these specific artworks:
1. Ophelia by Millais (1851)
2. The Murder of Marat by Jean-Jaques Hauer (1793)
3. Clytemnestra by Collier (1882)

At dinner, Emily told her mum about “all the dead people in the bathroom”, and began excitedly describing the stories behind them. My SIL asked what she was talking about, so I explained and she pulled me aside to say I should never have discussed such “gory and disturbing” topics with her daughter, and that I should have taken down the paintings before Emily arrived because I could have really scared her when talking about it.

It obviously wasn’t my intention to scare her, and she didn’t seem so when I was talking to her (on the contrary, it looked to me as if she was genuinely interested) but her mother would know her better than I, so I may have misinterpreted her behaviour.

At this point they’ve even shifted the argument into me being a materialistic selfish person who just wants more things and don’t care ab my brother well being when in reality I’m more so upset he didn’t even apologize till I brought it up days later and thought his excuse was fair. Ended up being a long story anyway lol, but was curious what people thought ab this. Thanks for reading this far ",1.0,1.0586534,1,1

So my mom is having to cover her mortgage, my rent, medical bills, Ubers to all of my appointments, meds, etc. She can’t keep affording everything.

I’ve been on the fence about it but I understand her situation is difficult. 

Now, I don’t hate this girl. She’s perfectly polite and she keeps her things tidy. However, she doesn’t really help around the house. I have two daughters in addition to my son, and they both help with house chores… they help me out with cooking, do the dishes, set the table, sweep, etc. My son’s GF has just not done that. I asked that she helps out with chores once she’d settled in, so two or three days after she officially moved in, and she’s just cleaned the things she leaves, basically. She does her own dishes and makes sure not to leave a mess, but it’s still not helping really? I told her that we do a rotation for dish washing, for example, and she said “oh, you don’t need to do my dishes”. I tried to be polite but earlier today I finally told her that she needed to actually pull her weight, and there’s more to house chores than not leaving your things spilled all over. I told her that I expected her to help out tomorrow, when we’re doing the full house cleaning. 

She didn’t just agree like I expected, but asked if my son would be participating. I told her that no, he’s staying in school for practice late and we’ll be done by the time that he gets home. She said that she had things to do after school too and asked to help a different day… we always clean on Mondays, and I’m not changing that for some girl my son is dating, I told her as such. She didn’t tell me what she was busy with, but she’s been here early the past two Mondays so I’m sure she can move whatever she needs to do. Finally, I told her that it’s fine if she doesn’t want to help out but that she will have to pay a “maid” fee, as my daughters and I are not just cleaning for free when she lives here too. She didn’t say anything afterwards, but my son got pretty mad about it when he found out.

Both my parents got a divorce in 2013, before my sister was born. We only see him every other week but majority of the time, were with my mother. My father (47) hardly ever talks to me, I have to beg him to give me a call or text me or I always have to reach out first but it's a problem when I don't ever text or call him. I try to bond with him, but he doesn't really seem to care and it kinda hurts, he thinks all I want is money and for him to buy me shit when thats not all what I want, I want a relationship with my dad where I can be close with him, I think he hardly ever comes around me is because he found out I was gay & just thought I was a full-blown feminine dude & that put me thru some guilt. 

  
Anyways, main point. So the other day i had to spend $10 on a public wifi pass because my wifi was out and my mom didn't know what was going on and I had a school assignment i had to finish. So i made a charge with my card and idk how it got thru to my dad, mind you he hasn't called me all week, not even the week before & when he saw the charge go to my card was the first time I heard from him in a while. Then he goes on complaining about how i js bought it to bs around, i told him it was for an assignment but he didn't believe me and after i tried showing him multiple times saying ""I'll show you the assignment right now"" he said he didn't wanna see it and that i'm just lying. 



So then i ask him ""Why is it you only ever call me when i happen to do something you don't like and you hardly ever call me to check up on me?"" It was dead silence for a good 20 seconds, then he says i'm just trying to throw him off track meanwhile that's something that i've been wondering for the longest time, I was scared to ask him because i knew this was how it was gonna react, he then starts cussing at me throwing every insult in the book he can think of saying i'm soft and weak & i kept yelling & cursing back then he tells me to ""watch my f\*ing mouth and to keep my respect on"" and laughed at me. I just lost it at that point, this wasn't the first time something like this has happened (not this exact situation but something similar) I then just cried after that, told him ""f\* you, you're a sad excuse of a father"" and hung up. he then told my mom and i guess she was just pissed I spent money on the wifi pass than me insulting him back. 

All this over a wi-fi pass?? A little unnecessary don't you think?

84,1fsnhb6,AITA for confronting my boyfriend about his eating habits?,"My boyfriend (32) and I (31 F) have been together for over a decade. We currently do not have any plans to marry (just not our sort of thing).

When I first met him in Highschool, I never noticed it much, aside from the occasional attempt to speak with food in his mouth. But since then, I have had legitimate trouble putting up with his poor manners in regards to eating.

He will talk with food in his mouth. He will take oversized bites that leave food or sauce on the sides of his mouth. He will lick food off of his fingers rather than use a napkin. He will set his utensils down directly on the table, even at restaurants. And whenever he has a carbonated beverage, he will ALWAYS( (I am not at all exaggerating) take an long drink (he goes through soda like they're bullets in an FPS) that causes him to immediately let out a loud burp. When this happens, I'm lucky if he places his hand in front of his mouth. He seldom does.

Now, here's the strange thing: he was raised from a very young age by his overly strict grandparents. The kind who would not even let him get away with anything. A single misstep, he would be disciplined. Having had lunch with them before they passed away, I know they were always very strict at the dinner table. He was also in the military right out of Highschool, for nearly 3 years, and his superior was a total hard-ass.

As for myself, I would like to think I have impeccable dining etiquette. I never rest my elbows on the table, never try to speak with even a few crumbs in my mouth, and never try to rush through my food. It's a meal, not a race. If I have too much, I take the rest to go. If it takes me 3 hours to eat because the food is messy and I'm taking small bites, I guess we're going to be at this restaurant for 3 hours. I was never grilled about my eating habits as a child, I have just always been this way. Even as a child, I always fretted about being a nuisance while eating. My grandma used to say I was eating like God was at the table. XD

I have tried on numerous occasions to discuss this with him, but he just blows me off. He makes excuses, or rolls his eyes and acts like I'm overreacting. Last week, when we met up for lunch. I sort of snapped. He was loudly slurping his pasta and getting oil on his chin, and AGAIN let out a huge burp after guzzling down about half of his drink. I shouted at him to stop doing that, to use his manners even though we weren't even in public. Since then, he has been angry with me for 'treating him like a child' and 'trying to shame him for eating'.

I'm sure he'll get over it, but was I in the wrong here? I'm not his mother, but I feel like he could at least make a small effort not to make me so uncomfortable. And I know he knows how much it bothers me.

85,1fsn90e,AITA for starting to hate my bff ,"
I (24F) and my best friend (22F) have been close for 6-7 years. We met in high school and would always hang out, enjoying each other’s company. Our families are also close, with her mom like a second mom to me. Things have gotten weird over the past year. We planned a vacation to Greece, just the two of us, and it was our first big trip without our families.

For context, my friend has always been boy crazy, constantly in relationships and waiting for the next guy. It’s never been a huge issue, and she’s often the victim in abusive or toxic relationships or with inappropriate age gaps. I’ve always felt bad for her, thinking she’d learn from her mistakes, but she never does. It bothers me because she ends up in situations she can’t escape, and I get that it's hard to leave abusive relationships—but why keep going for the same type of guy? It’s exhausting as her friend to always help pick up the pieces. The only way she ever leaves a guy is when she finds a new one.

In Greece, on the third day, we were at a bar, both drunk. I wasn’t worried because we always had each other's backs. She flirted with a guy—no big deal, I was doing the same. But later, I couldn’t find her and learned from the bartender that she had left with the guy without telling me. I freaked out, thinking she was kidnapped, and had to walk home alone. She didn’t come back until 7 a.m. That’s when everything shifted. I realized we weren’t on the same page anymore, and everything she does started bothering me.

I still love her and she’s one of my closest friends, but I can’t keep up with the same drama. She talks about focusing on herself and maybe going back to school, but it never happens. All she does is go out and drink, and now she’s talking to multiple guys, including two coworkers, the guy from Greece, and someone I was supposed to go on a date with next week. She casually dropped his name in conversation, and I didn’t even know they were talking. I was shocked because this was a guy I liked in high school.

It’s not about that one guy, but it frustrates me that she just talks to anyone who shows her attention. I’m torn—I don’t want to lose her as a friend, but I feel myself becoming nasty toward her because of the resentment I have over her choices. I don’t think we have anything in common anymore, and I’m starting to hate her for her poor decisions. Am I the asshole for feeling this way?

88,1fsmx4c,"AITA for calling my friend a b***h making jokes about how I ""force"" my voice?","I (19F) have a friend (18F) and we usually play games online together. 

We usually play games like Minecraft and Roblox together and often talk to each other through the microphones on the game. 

My voice has always been something I've been insecure about, its just this whole complex about it not sounding feminine enough. She's one of the people close enough to me that I usually talk to her in a more relaxed and I guess what you could call my ""normal voice"". 

Whenever we play games with other people, I will admit I do force it a bit, but nothing over the top, it still sounds like a normal talking voice, it just sounds more smooth and put together, not sure how to explain it. I guess I just exaggerate my words a bit more but don't change the pitch of it or anything. I don't use a voice changer, I just turn on the real time replay so I can listen to myself on my headphones as I talk. I'm not really doing it for attention or anyone else but me and to boost my own self esteem. I always get really nice compliments from both girls and guys on my voice when I do it and it just makes me feel a little bit better about myself. 

We kind of stopped playing games for a pretty long time, but we've been playing a lot recently, and I've noticed her throwing snide remarks at me saying stuff like ""you do not sound like that!"" and ""you sound like a pick mee"" or ""you sound like those TikTok girls"", in front of other people and alone. There's also this meme from Roblox about this girl who says ""I go vroom vroom!"" and she keeps saying that in a high voice to make fun of me. Not to mention she keeps repeating whatever I say in a super high pitched voice while laughing. All of these happen during random conversations where I'm just making jokes and telling her about my day. 

Everyone pretty much assumes that it is my normal voice (BECAUSE IT BASICALLY IS) until she starts making jokes about it. I always kind of laugh it off while telling her to stop, but lately its been all she talks about. 

Yesterday she was doing it again and I just got super pissed off and called her a bitch and said that I basically sound the same and that she was doing too much. I know people forcing their voices are annoying but 1. Why does she care if I do anyways, is it affecting her in any way?? and 2. I wasn't even trying to fully force my voice, I just exaggerate some words a bit more because I like the way it sounds compared to how I talk normally. She immediately logged off and we haven't spoken since.

I was wondering if I should maybe reach out to apologize because I know I haven't been super clear with my boundaries and I know she might find it annoying but I basically sound normal to most of the people I've asked including most of my family and she's been the only one who seems to be annoyed by it.

so my parent usually argue about the mildest things but usually gets blown out of proportion with my mum yelling and my dad apologising over nothing and her going back again to make him mad and makes herself the victim then sometimes when it gets bad she will threaten to find a new place to live because she ""cant deal with his abusive behaviour"" my dad is not at all abusive, i see pretty much all of their relationship and he is not abusive at all

my dad works from home, and my mum works as a social worker and she gets home really late (from 6-10pm) but usually in the later hours. i have been very sick these past few weeks and i know thats been taking a toll on them so i try my best to be respectful. my mum sleeps in the bedroom and my dad on the couch in the living room, this has been normal for years, reasons, ""dad snores too loud"" i often get woken up by my mother snoring in the night. they seem fine with this arrangement, my mum expects breakfast and dinner in bed every morning, which she gets and will complain majorly when something is wrong 

anyways thats not all of backstory but its enough for now so heres what happened (shortened for word limit)

Mother asks about nail clippers brother apparently gave dad

Dad doesnt know where they are because brother didnt give them to him but get mother different pair

Mother gets mad for lying and losing and gaslighting her about the nail clippers

(back and forth with mum yelling and dad staying calm)

Dad apologises and she calls him a fing POS and hes “attacking her\* and shes the victim whatnot

then she called him a ""fucking piece of shit"" under her breath and yeah, so she also has a habit of bringin up every thing wrong with my behaviour/apperance to not only family but her friends and coworkers so the next day she was about to leave for work and i heard her talking to my dad listing off everything bad about how i looked yesterday I HAVE BEEN SICK FOR A TERM OF COURSE I LOOK LIKE SHIT and i have asked her again and again not to talk about me to others and she still does and i just stood there staring at her  and she turned around and was like ""Hi OP how are you"" like what she said befoer never happened and i just stared at her and walked in my room. she went on a rant about how shes not respected and im mad for nothin and shes a victim and we havent really spoken for a few days

One of my best friends is getting married next year. We are a very close group of 5 friends. The bridal party is the remaining 4 of us. We planned to stay in-country for the bachelorette (something around a 5 hr drive away) but some things have changed since we made those initial plans. The bride is now moving out of country (5 hr flight away) and it seems more convenient (for the bride) for us to go to her, rather than for her to come home. Now, my other 3 friends want to spend approx. $2500 on a bachelorette trip out of country to go to her, rather than force her to fly home for a less extravagant bachelorette here.

I feel like a shitty friend for not immediately committing to this, but I find it extremely hard to do. I’ve been struggling with a lot lately, (whole other story) and as a result of that I don’t even have a job at the moment. I feel trapped as if I have to go  and make it work or else face being perceived as a bad friend.

91,1fsmtzc,AITA for leaving up posts of an old friend,"A few weeks ago I had a friend text me asking to take down my instagram posts with them in it. Lets call him Josh. We were friends for about three years, and for the majority he has had access to my instagram and has known that I post on there. Its been four months since we last spoke (until this), since I sort of went ghost on him and he just let it happen. Before we stopped talking he had been getting closer with one of his friends and was slowly becoming more of an asshole (super judge mental and bigoted) just like her. That's the main reason I stopped talking to him.

Back to three weeks ago, I got a text on snap asking to take down all of my posts with him in it. Mind you this includes birthdays, parties, events, etc., but didn't include any sort of unbecoming behavior (not even drinks present). In this paragraph he claims that he's disappointed in me, that he's disgusted by my behavior and that I should have asked to post any photos of him in the first place. I, trying to be reasonable, agree to take down some of them. However, there are still a few posts that I would like to keep up given that they were important events and he's primarily in group photos.

I decide to block him on snap because I could not care less and didn't intend to contact him again. Nothing after that. Just a few days ago I found out Josh blocked my younger brother due to a petty disagreement over music. This sparked a bit of annoyance in me but wasn't a huge deal.

Now today, my birthday and 6 month anniversary, Josh sends a text to one of our mutual friends and asks her to forward it to me. It essentially said that he noticed I'd taken down a few posts but still had four up, listed them out and sent screenshots. He then reinforced his points from before that he's frankly disappointed in me for not having the decency of a good friend to ask about posting the photos or taking them all down. My boyfriend told me to just leave it be, since it is my birthday and (as far as I'm aware) Josh knows that. I sent a quick response back saying that it's not my problem and he should've said something sooner/asked me not to post them when I took them because it's generally assumed nowadays that people will post you online and there's only so much you can do about it. He even included a link to a tutorial on how to take down individual photos from a post which I find to be a little petty.

Knowing I might be in the wrong I ask my dad, who I believe has pretty good morals, and he agrees that I'm not at fault. If there was a genuine issue with his photos being up it would've been appropriate to ask for them to be taken down when we were still friends. Given that he's had access to my instagram this long it's his fault for not saying anything and essentially just changing his mind and it's not my job to make sure everything is cleared out. I'm not a very angry person but this whole thing has really managed to piss me off.

So I guess i should start with a bit of background. I recently got into contact with my biological father after 27 years of no contact as he left when I was a baby. Things are going ok and we're slowly getting to know each other. But he is flying into my city in a few days and wants to meet up. Which is great but he hasn't been talking about details like dates or places with me. He has however been talking about those things to my mother as I learned today when she asked what time she should pick me up for dinner with the bio dad on Thursday. I was not aware he had even picked a day, nevermind a time. He has invited my mother to said dinner but both him and my mother have said my spouse has to stay home. When I asked why I got ganged up on by both of them on how they think it's inappropriate for my spouse to be there because he has nothing to do with the situation but it's OK for my mother as she knows bio dad. I have stated that I am not comfortable with that as I don't know him and would like my spouse to come, but now I'm the bad guy and am apparently being unreasonable for wanting to bring my spouse. Am I really being that unreasonable? Why is it inappropriate for my spouse to be there to support me but it's appropriate for my mother to be there to support ""me"" (she's only going to make him feel better not me)
TLDR- I'm meeting my biological father for the first time and he won't let my spouse come but he wants my mother to be there instead even though I'm uncomfortable with that.

Update: I'm putting my foot down even firmer than I have been. I'm not sure why my mother is so gungho for this situation but it's not one I want to be in without someone who is there to support me and only me. At this point it's feeling like I would be their chaperone for a date and if he truly wants a relationship he'll either have dinner with me and my SO. My spouse has been nothing but supportive he's just hurt that my mother is actively trying to exclude him from the dinner. Thank you for all the advice and for confirming that I am not crazy lol

Update 2: He is apparently so adamant on it because his therapist told him to not let me bring my spouse.

93,1fsm3eu,AITA for telling my mom I don’t like being yelled at?,"So, me (16M) and my mom (35F) went out to get some Dairy Queen and I told her that she should download the Dairy Queen app because her birthday is coming up and she should get a free blizzard. 

While we were in line she got the app and after we got our ice cream, we tried to work out the point system. The app telling us to scan the barcode for points. The only problem is that there was no barcode, just QR codes, so I mentioned it. 

We tried to work it out, her saying to maybe try the QR code at the top after the one at the bottom didn’t work. As I was trying to scan the top QR code I said “but it’s a QR code?” because I didn’t get why the app would say barcode when there was only QR codes on the receipt. In hindsight I might have been a bit of an ass saying thats. Like, mansplaining it. Idk.

After I said that she raised her voice at me telling me that she knew that and to stop talking to her like she was dumb, saying I was being a jerk and a dick. I told her that I wasn’t trying to be a jerk and that I didn’t like her yelling at me, that it didn’t make me feel nice.

And it just kept going back and forth and eventually I said that I didn’t want to have this conversation anymore since the things that needed to be said were said, her saying that she didn’t like me sounding like I was insulting her intelligence, and me saying that I wasn’t trying is be a jerk and I didn’t like being yelled at. 

After I said that she snatched the receipt out of my hand and crumpled it up angrily and took her phone back (since it was still resting in my lap as this was a very brief interaction). She said that I don’t get to say that as the son and her as the mother and it just kept going on and on, me talking a pause to explain myself and apologise, saying that I was sorry if it came off that I was insulting her intelligence, it wasn’t my intention to do so and that I was just confused about the whole barcode-QR code thing.

And she just talked about how I was immune to criticism or something and after that I just kinda shut up and she’s been giving me the silent treatment since and when she does talk to me it’s like I’m and inconvenience. I dunno that’s just how it feels and how to goes every time I say I don’t like something.

This just has me upset and I don’t really know what to do about it. I already apologized, but I assume she wants me to give another one like how I usually do after we argue, but the only problem is that I want one too since I just really don’t like how she made me feel and didn’t acknowledge it after I expressed that to her. Like, yeah she’s the mom and I’m the kid, but I just don’t like how certain things make me feel especially after things so small.

I just don’t know if I’m wrong for wanting an apology too or if I’m in the wrong for all of this in general and since I don’t really have anyone to talk about this to, I’m turning to you guys for outside opinion.

For me this is a massive opportunity to profess my faith, which for me is the most important thing anyone can do. No matter your personal struggles and ambitions what could be greater than salvation.

So I started telling her about my convertion and the position of the church about many things and I told her that it is great she is going to church but the most important thing to do for her was to confess. She told me she was not comfortable doing that, she thought she had nothing to confess about and that she was a good person. So (with the best of my intentions) I started to tell her about all of the things she has ever done that are sinful, and I went to very personal subjects. She got upset, she is angry with me and wants me to apologize. Am I the asshole for telling her to confess and using her past mistakes and very personal things to persuade her to?

I mean she did ask about my experience and my advice. All of the things I said were with her wellbeing in mind. However I understand if it came off as quite agressive. I dont think I should apologize as I believe in everything I said however maybe I should as I hurt her feelings?

For context I am very religious and she is not. I had never been so open about my views with her before so I understand if she felt judged and hurt.

There was a point in the conversation where she asked me about my faith (I am Catholic) and told me she started going to church. For me this is a massive opportunity to profess my faith, which for me is the most important thing anyone can do.

97,1fsjraj,AITA for joining my friend's calls even though it makes my boyfriend upset?,"I (20F) and my boyfriend (21M) are in a long distance relationship. I moved about an hour away for college, and we’ve been dating for a couple months now (we were friends in our friend group before we started dating). We’ve been calling nearly every night since I’ve moved, and while I don’t visit our city as often, we’ve been doing good! Recently, though, our friend group has been trying to schedule game nights on discord where we all play multiplayer games and chat. We’ve been doing them since way before I moved, but those game nights are pretty much the only times I get to talk to them in real time (we’re in an active group chat). My bf has told me that he feels jealous when I join these calls, and he closes up in our text messages whenever I confirm I’ll be attending these calls. 

He says he doesn’t wanna keep me from joining them, but I’ve felt so bad that I’ve made up excuses to get out of the game night calls to call him instead since he hasn’t been joining them. I really miss my friends and I want to join these calls, but I don’t want to make my bf sad. When I’ve asked why he feels jealous about this stuff, he says he feels like I’ll forget him or love him less when I hang out with my friends (he joined the friend group later than everyone else). He says he feels really bad about the whole situation. I feel stuck in a corner here, I don’t want to hurt him but I miss my friends. I’m genuinely concerned ITA here, but regardless on if I am, what can I tell him that will make him feel better? I’ve tried to tell him that no amount of time I spend with my friends will make me love him any less, and that seemed to make him feel a little better at least, but he still doesn’t want to join the calls.

99,1fsj0jn,WIBTA for making my boyfriend miss a “wedding” to go to lake house with my family?,"25F and BF 27. We started dating in early 2023. I live in a different state than my parents. The state our lakehouse is in is almost in the middle of where I live and my parents (and brother) live. My parents both travel a lot with work so I don’t see them very often. In 2 weekends, my parents asked if my bf and I would like to go to our lakehouse for the weekend with them, my brother and his wife, my niece and my grandparents. This will be the first time since before my bf and I were dating that we will all be together like this. 

Now why was wedding in “”… my boyfriend has a friend from college who is getting married that weekend. I’ve only met this friend once and I don’t think my bf has seen him much since college. I don’t think they’re that close. Let me preface this by saying I kind of feel bad for him…

When they got engaged my bf told me about it and was going on about how great of a wedding it’s going to be. After a few months go by it turns out my bf was not invited to the wedding (which isn’t small, 150+ guests). He found out through a friend who was. Recently (like a month and a half ago) the friend reached out to my bf and invited us to the after party. So after the wedding and reception (this after party is NOT the reception) they have a bus to a bar where some people from the reception will go. This party will be from 11-2. He’s over the moon and wants us to go. 

I think we should go to the lake house because this is a rare opportunity. I might be an asshole because we heard about the “wedding” first. Splitting up is possible but I want him to be there and he wants me to be there.

100,1fsisfu,AITA for not putting a potato in the oven for my brother?,"
Making another post on my throwaway. This is not an update, but a separate incident that happened recently 

Recap from my previous post: me (22F) and my brother (23M) Khenan are living with our parents for the time being to avoid having to pay rent and utilities and our jobs while we take an incredibly time consuming, at-home coding bootcamp. Taken on zoom, where we are required to be on camera at all times.

Despite the time investment, my brother is still going to the gym and walking a lot. A shitload. More than he used to. He often takes the classes lunch break to do these things even at the risk of being late.

I’ve had to run down and unlock the house door for him because he decides to show up minutes before class begins again, which cuts into my time, and I’ve honestly contemplated just leaving him out. Or having our younger brother (20M) do it, but he never does it and I’m forced to open it myself.

In the past week, he’s been taking time helping our mother (49F) and our father (52M) with our pregnant sister and grandparents, but he still tries to spend hours at a time either walking or at the gym. And while I’m relaxing, he constantly calls me asking me to put 1 or 2 potatoes in the oven for him. I did it at first, but it’s irritating and selfish that he keeps asking me to do it instead of doing it himself BEFORE he leaves so it’s ready when he comes back.

I tell him this. He claims he’s busy and can’t predict how long he’ll be gone for, (The potatoes takes 2 hours to cook) and that he doesn’t want his food to be charred and burnt or sitting cold for 7 hours. But that really shouldn’t matter, he can just make it when he comes back. 

I also tell him that and he just snaps at me, claiming that I constantly bully him for his weight and keep telling him he’s too light (He’s 5’8 and 140lbs! Every woman in our family is bigger than that, he could gain a few pounds), but he can’t trust us to help him “Properly” bulk up. And thinks we think he’s better off fat. And that it’s ridiculous to eat a full meal at 9 PM. (He’s the only one that has a problem with this)

Today, he leaves for the gym and to help our sister again. He asked me at the gym. I just told him I wasn’t fucking doing it, and to do it himself. He gives me the same excuse and I just hang up.

He and our mother come back at 7, on an unrelated note I ordered chilis and decided I didn’t want to finish my food, so I offer it to him. He just barks at me and calls me selfish and ridiculous. He didn’t want to eat fast food, but he didn’t eat at all that day. This devolves into a screaming match between me him and our father about his eating habits, where I am constantly told to shut up and to stop bothering everyone.

I know this is word salad, but please give me a judgement. AITA?",Not enough info,2024-09-30,"AITA for not putting a potato in the oven for my brother?

101,1fsis2c,AITA for not buying cookies?,"A month ago my mom broke her ankle. I took three days off to get her to appointments and make sure she had groceries, a wheelchair, cat food is accessible, those things. 

She lives about an hour away. The last three weeks I took my daughter to hang out with her while I:

Got six double doozies from Great American Cookie
Picked up lunch from Longhorn. 
Got an order from Freddie's.
A chili burger from Taco John's.
A medium vanilla coke from Sonic.
Cash from an ATM.
Groceries 

Did all that once a week for three weeks. Today, I told her I was in town with a friend playing disc golf. I could get groceries, but not the other stuff. Use Door Dash if you want it.

She proceeded to yell at my friend for being too busy, yelled at me for being an ungrateful piece of shit son who never does anything for her, etc. I responded badly and said something to the effect of ""you're going to be fucking grateful I brought this so you don't starve."" Also set up Door Dash on her phone while she literally bawled about how hard everything is and how much I suck as a human and she could just die and nobody would care.
