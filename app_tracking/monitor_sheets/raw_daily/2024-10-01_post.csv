1,1ftcc03,WIBTA for refusing to go back in the closet to keep my grandma happy? ,"For context, I (20M) am a transgender man. I have been medically transitioning for a year and a half and will be getting top surgery in 3 days. Every person in my life sees me as a man. That is, everyone except my grandmother (84F). 

She is still referring to me using my deadname (which is not even my legal name anymore) and addressing me as a girl or a woman (I already have a deep voice, can grow facial hair and will have had top surgery by the time I see her next). She puts in no effort at all to address me correctly, despite me and my parents (55M and 51F) telling her that I am a man. 

Since I am Indian, we have it in our culture that respecting elders is important and it would be disrespectful to go against them or disagree with them, even if they are wrong. 

I am traveling home after I have had surgery to see my family and have time to relax before I return to college in the winter. During this time, my father wants to bring my grandma home so she can see me. She hasn‚Äôt seen me in person in two years since I wasn‚Äôt in the country, but I would rarely call her due to the fact that she would not address me correctly and any reminder of my transition to her felt like something she couldn‚Äôt accept. I don‚Äôt want to have to feel afraid of her or unsafe in my own home. I also have no say in whether or not I want to be around her. 

I spoke to some friends who are not transgender and they told me that since she is old, she‚Äôll just keep deadnaming me and I should let her because me telling her won‚Äôt change that. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that her ability to remember it will cost my happiness. She is also not showing any signs of any condition affecting her memory. She still seems to be able to remember everything else but my name.  It‚Äôs been four years. 

I also don‚Äôt think age should be an excuse for not even trying. Plenty of other older people in my life have been very supportive. My other grandma (74F) and an older teacher (62M) have shown me so much support. All I ask for is basic respect and to be treated like a human.

2,1ftwh4o,AITA for returning my ex best friend‚Äôs things while he wasn‚Äôt home?,"I (27F) had quite a bad argument with my (29M) best friend which resulted in him telling me that he cares about me, but he feels like we just don‚Äôt work as friends and before I could even reply he blocked me on absolutely everything. I had a birthday present that I made by hand for him which he knew about. I was heartbroken, but also extremely angry that he told me I was the most important person in his life and he could never lose me to then a month later blocking me and not even letting me respond to his message that he was done. While I was angry I grabbed his birthday present and went to his apartment. I knocked on the door and his roommate answered and I asked him if I could dump my ex best friend‚Äôs things in his room and his roommate said sure come in so I went into his room and just dumped it all on the bed and instantly left. The reason I just went there was because I no longer had any way to contact him and I didn‚Äôt want the birthday present I made for him anymore.

I was telling a friend about this and she went absolutely mental at me telling me I am unhinged and then accusing me of being a criminal for breaking into his house and that she feels extremely unsafe around me because I am a disgusting stalker harassing this guy and breaking into his apartment and that she hopes he presses charges against me and that if he does she will also tell the police that I broke into his house. 

This really shocked me because I never broke in, I knocked on the door and was let in by the roommate, which to my knowledge isn‚Äôt a crime. I‚Äôm even more upset that she would accuse me of committing a crime when I know my best friend never locks his front door so if I wanted to I could have just walked in, but I didn‚Äôt want to do that and I knocked to make sure they were ok with me coming in to drop the stuff off. I just don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs so angry at me. 

Edit: people are asking what the argument is about so: 

The reason we had an argument is that we used to date but he said he wasn‚Äôt ready for a relationship but he was in love with me and when the time was right I‚Äôd be his girlfriend. I found out he slept with someone else and made a joke that I was jealous of her (we were also have sex with each other at the time) and he basically had a huge go at me telling me I‚Äôm not allowed to dictate who he has sex with and I told him that I never told him he can‚Äôt have sex with anyone I merely made a joke about being jealous as he always jokes that I‚Äôm a jealous type of person and I said I don‚Äôt care he can have sex with whoever he wants and he told me that he can‚Äôt have sex with whoever he wants because he constantly worries that it will upset me and I told him that if he‚Äôs worried that‚Äôs on him and I‚Äôve never had a go at him ever for sleeping with someone else so I don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs all coming from and that‚Äôs when he said we aren‚Äôt working and blocked me. 

While I admit I was extremely upset and not thinking logically when I took the gift over I also spent weeks and weeks non stop making this gift by hand and didn‚Äôt want to spend all that time and hard work on something for it to go in the bin. It was also personalised to him so I couldn‚Äôt have given it to someone else.

4,1ftvu8w,AITA Monthly Open Forum October 2024: Rule 8 Re-Revisited,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.


In 2023 we did a [Please Don't Feed the Trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qxvu1/aita_monthly_open_forum_february_2023_trolls/) appeal (more on that later). This month, we're taking a look at all the parts of Rule 8.

#No shitposts 
This is pretty self-explanatory. We're here to provide judgment on real-life conflicts. Gender swaps, tv/movie/book plots, creative writing exercises, and flat-out trolling is banned. If you‚Äôd like to post something about a TV show or movie, you may want to check out our sister sub, r/amithebuttface. The rules are much more relaxed over there.

Of course, not everything that looks like a shitpost actually is. At least once a week, I'll read something and think ""this has to be a shitpost"" only to do a quick check and find comments from people who've been in the same situation. Or something on OP‚Äôs profile that backs up the story. People lead messy, complicated lives and dysfunctional behavior may be normalized for some. Please keep in mind that your doubt is not proof of a shitpost. Some other things that are not proof:

- A new or recent account with zero feedback. Remember - we welcome throwaways!
- The conflict is one you've seen a lot of posts about. Many people read a post and think ‚ÄúHey! I had something similar happen to me!‚Äù
- OP doesn't respond to questions or otherwise comment. OPs can commonly get downvoted to hell, even if they respond with an honest ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right - that was shitty and I need to apologize.‚Äù

If you suspect a shitpost, report it so we can review. If you have actual proof, please [modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=) us with a link to the post and a brief explanation of your proof. 

#Posts must be presented as fairly and accurately as possible. 
A certain amount of bias is inevitable when explaining a conflict, and some OPs are truly dealing with extremely difficult people. ""Fairly and accurately"" is for situations where OP goes too far to cast the other party in a bad light. OP is allowed to describe something actually said during a conflict, but naming someone Karen, referring to them as ""bridezilla"" or a ""man baby"" or describing them as ""having always been a narcissistic POS"" is way over the top. Please report these posts for Rule 8.

#Posts must be written entirely by you and from your own point of view. Do not post on behalf of others, or from the point of view of another person in the story.

AI-generated posts and comments are not allowed here. That's because AI is a predictive tool; it's anticipating what's likely and inherently prone to inaccuracy. 

Only the person involved in the conflict may post, and only as themself. It's not ok to pretend to be your father or your partner. And Reddit accounts are free so if a friend or relative wants judgment from AITA they can create their own account and post.

We also don't allow comments or counter-posts from someone claiming to be involved in the conflict. There's no way to know if the claim is real, if it's OP trying to manipulate the vote, or if it's someone trolling.

AI/POV posts should be reported for Rule 8. This report option isn't available for comments so use Rule 1 or drop us a quick modmail.

#Seriously, don't feel the trolls!!
Finally, a reminder that calling out a post as fake, creative writing, ragebait, etc. is a violation of Rule 1. Comments like these can only reward the trolls or insult innocent OPs. Remember - trolls crave attention. Even ‚Äúbad‚Äù attention, like calling out the shitpost is giving them what they want. DON‚ÄôT. FEED. THE. TROLLS.

The best way to see fewer shitposts is to report them, send proof to modmail when possible, and don't comment.

5,1ftvth0,AITA For calling my wife out for never doing the hard chores,"My wife (40F) and I (39M) have been married for 7 years and have 2 kids (4 & 2).  We both work full time but have different schedules.  I work a standard M-F 40-hour week.  My wife's job requires her to work Saturdays so she takes random days off during the week to compensate.  Both our kids are in daycare during the week.  

When my wife takes a day off during the week, she will get chores done like cleaning, shopping, laundry, etc.  Which is great that she can get that stuff done on her off days.  But these are things that can also be done on the weekend.  She will leave other, more labor-intensive chores for me to do on the weekend.  We have a 1-acre yard so there is always yardwork to be done.  And it is nearly impossible for me to do that kind of work on Saturdays when she's at work and I have the kids.  

I've talked to her numerous times about doing yardwork on her days off when I'm at work and the kids are in daycare.  But she refuses because ""it's too hard.""  Which, yeah, I know. I'm the only one who does it.  It's even harder when you're chasing around 2 kids.  This means that I have to spend pretty much my entire Sunday doing yardwork.  Every single week.  

We've argued because she gets a work and kid-free day to herself to get things done.  But she picks the easiest chores and leaves the hard ones for me to do on my one remaining weekend day.  I work M-F, then have the kids by myself all day Saturday.  I just want to spend some time on Sunday watching football and relaxing.  But I can't because of the yardwork.  

This past week, my wife took Thursday off and got some chores done.  When I got home with the kids that night, she made some comments that pissed me off.  She kept saying ""We still need to mow the lawn this weekend.""  ""We need to trim some bushes and trees and bring the brush to the yard waste site.""  ""I think we should rake up all the fallen pine needles and pinecones to use as fire-starters.""  

I snapped at her and asked her which of those things she was going to do, since she kept saying ""we.""  She got defensive and said that she is going to be watching the kids so that I can get that stuff done.  I told her that I think she is using the word ""we"" incorrectly then, because it sounds like I'm going to be the one doing all of it.

She then went off about all the things she got done on her day off.  When I told her that I could do all of those things on Saturday, even with the kids, but she refuses to do any of the hard stuff.  I then asked her if she could tell me the last day she had the kids by herself when I wasn't home.  She couldn't answer and called me a jerk. 

I told her if I can learn to fold a fitted sheet, then she can learn how to use a rake, a lawnmower, a weed whip, etc.  I also told her that I am going to start planning things for myself on weekends so that I have my own time, even if it means hiring a sitter.   

She thinks I'm overreacting and expecting too much of her because the yard work is hard.

I've talked to her numerous times about doing yardwork on her days off when I'm at work and the kids are in daycare.  But she refuses because ""it's too hard.""  Which, yeah, I know. I'm the only one who does it.  It's even harder when you're chasing around 2 kids.  This means that I have to spend pretty much my entire Sunday doing yardwork.  Every single week.  

We've argued because she gets a work and kid-free day to herself to get things done.  But she picks the easiest chores and leaves the hard ones for me to do on my one remaining weekend day.  I work M-F, then have the kids by myself all day Saturday.  I just want to spend some time on Sunday watching football and relaxing.  But I can't because of the yardwork.  

This past week, my wife took Thursday off and got some chores done.  When I got home with the kids that night, she made some comments that pissed me off.  She kept saying ""We still need to mow the lawn this weekend.""  ""We need to trim some bushes and trees and bring the brush to the yard waste site.""  ""I think we should rake up all the fallen pine needles and pinecones to use as fire-starters.""  

I snapped at her and asked her which of those things she was going to do, since she kept saying ""we.""  She got defensive and said that she is going to be watching the kids so that I can get that stuff done.  I told her that I think she is using the word ""we"" incorrectly then, because it sounds like I'm going to be the one doing all of it.

She then went off about all the things she got done on her day off.  When I told her that I could do all of those things on Saturday, even with the kids, but she refuses to do any of the hard stuff.  I then asked her if she could tell me the last day she had the kids by herself when I wasn't home.  She couldn't answer and called me a jerk. 

I told her if I can learn to fold a fitted sheet, then she can learn how to use a rake, a lawnmower, a weed whip, etc.  I also told her that I am going to start planning things for myself on weekends so that I have my own time, even if it means hiring a sitter.   

She thinks I'm overreacting and expecting too much of her because the yard work is hard.  ",3.0,0.06854896992444992,0,0

7,1ftvpvo,AITA for not answering my gaming friend‚Äôs phone call?,"Hi judges,
My (26 F) internet friend, let's call her Sandy (23 F) has a history of calling me and getting upset if I don't respond right away. She lives on the west coast, and I live in the Midwest.

We have met in person a handful of times, gone on weekend trips, etc. but I wouldn't consider her one of my closest friends. She doesn't have many ""real life"" friends, so I try to be of support the best I can with the distance and such.
3 weeks ago, Sandy called me out of the blue after not talking for a few weeks. I was in the middle of talking to my family over something that was pretty devastating (TW: miscarriage) My older sister had just miscarried and wasn't able to receive medical care due to Texas laws. It was traumatic and painful for her, and obviously heartbreaking for our family.

I texted Sandy the next day apologizing for missing her call and asking if she needed to talk. She snapped on me, calling me a bad friend and that she realizes who her ""true friends are"" without giving me any other details. I told her she can reach out to me when she wants to do so respectfully. Fast forward to a couple of days ago. I was out in the city with a mutual friend, Mars (24 M) enjoying the weekend. I had mentioned to him that I feel bad for whatever Sandy is going through and I assume she is pregnant and having a hard time making a decision. He went pale and said nothing on the subject, confirming my suspicions but I didn't press it any further. Sandy has always been adamant on not wanting kids, so I made my assumption and accepted that it's not my circus, not my monkeys.

However, Sandy called Mars while we were out and got upset that we were together, insinuating that he is ""picking sides"" by committing to plans we had made months ago. She snapped on him, suggesting that he spilled the beans and was talking bad about her behind her back, none of which is true. Mars has always been a very good friend to the both of us and was very adamant in not discussing her business to me and I really admired and respected that. I may have been the AH in this decision, but I felt the need to stand up for Mars. I told Sandy that Mars never once mentioned her situation, but I simply assumed that she fell pregnant and was scared on what to do moving forward. 

I opened up to her that my sister had just lost her pregnancy and it was a very sensitive subject for me currently, but that I would always support her in any of her decisions. I explained that my family had just found out about the miscarriage as I missed Sandy's call. Sandy then said that I was victimizing myself, that it was ""weird"" that I was so upset that my sister miscarried, and that she hopes my *sister* feels better.

I was pretty hurt by her lack of understanding and empathy and kind of expected to be cut a little slack while I grieve. It feels like petty high school drama over an adult subject.

I (28F) am engaged to my fianc√© (30M). We both love fun, quirky things, and when planning our wedding, we decided we wanted to do something a bit out of the ordinary. I came up with the idea of making the cake the centerpiece of a mini-reality show for our wedding. Basically, We would film a series of short clips leading up to the wedding, where I‚Äôd try to bake the cake myself and document all the ‚Äúdrama‚Äù that ensued. I thought it would be hilarious, and my fianc√© initially agreed.

After agreeing I could tell he was hesitant to letting me do it, but I didn't really think anything of it. He has a big family and was worried that they might take the whole thing too seriously. He kept saying things like, ‚ÄúWhat if my mom doesn‚Äôt get the joke?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhat if my grandma thinks it‚Äôs disrespectful?‚Äù I assured him that our friends and family have a good sense of humor and that it would just be a lighthearted way to share our wedding planning experience. He told me he would 'prefer' if I didn't make the video, but after I told him it would just be fun to look back on, he told me 'ok fine, whatever'. I could tell he wasn't a fan of the idea for whatever reason, but I really thought there was no harm and just wanted to have some fun.

I went ahead and created a YouTube channel for the show. I started filming myself making the cake, talking to the camera like I was with Gordon Ramsey on a cooking show, and even pulling in some of my bridesmaids to join the ‚Äúcompetition.‚Äù

Last night at a dinner before our wedding this weekend, I decided to show a sneak peek of the series, complete with clips of me almost setting the kitchen on fire and epically failing at cake decorating. 

Everyone was laughing, but my fianc√© looked increasingly uncomfortable as the video played. He finally stood up and said, ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt funny it‚Äôs embarrassing!‚Äù

My fianc√© has been upset ever since, saying I made our wedding planning a joke and that it‚Äôs not how he envisioned things going. 

He told me that he made himself clear that he didn't want me to do it, I really thought it was all in good fun and thought that him initially agreeing to it meant he should've just let me have my fun.

To summarize my (30s M) situation, my mom (60s) has credit in the 4s or 5s and is in debt multiple thousands of dollars to multiple property rental companies; as a result, her options as far as where she can move are limited.  I want to step up to help and rent something in my name, as I'm certain she'd be able to pay rent, but am unsure how this would effect me if I wanted to try to rent or buy something on my own.

This is honestly kind of a pattern with her; she has her cable and utilities in my grandmother's name, and intermittently reaches out to both myself and my father (her first husband) for cash loans.  My Mom has pretty much been asking for or borrowing money from me my entire life (she even randomly decided to move into my 1br apartment with me for about a year or so when I was 21.)

She was briefly homeless toward the end of last year, as she procrastinated on not only trying to find a new place to live, but also on even packing; the move was a 24 hour ordeal as helping her move usually involves also helping her pack as if she was only given 24 hours notice to do so.  She was wrestling with an injury, but it was still very frustrating.

I'm honestly just exhausted from a life of what I've only recently recognized as parentification, and I don't know what to do.  I want to be able to live my life free from the burden and not continue enabling, but I suffer from insane guilt knowing my Mom is struggling, and she's definitely heavily implied that she felt abandoned by me not leaving my place to find a 2-br with her last year when she was homeless.

  
EDIT: I should probably say definitively that there's no addiction, as far as I know.  Maybe a shopping addiction, but no substances.

1) I don't care about my mother checking in on her granddaughter. I only care about them having regular conversations that might cause my ex to think I still care about her/want to get back together.
2) I didn't actually yell at my mother. It was just a conversation over text messages.
3) Everyone seems to think I did the bare minimum for my daughter.

I‚Äôll start with a bit of background. I have been divorced for over 2 years and have a 5 year old daughter that lives with her mother, my ex-wife. Until recently, I have dealt with my ex-wife‚Äôs manipulative, narcissistic, and emotionally abusive behavior because it‚Äôs what I was use to for our 9 year marriage. I‚Äôve had friends and family (including my mother) who all tried to get me to see it during that time, but it took my current girlfriend who will eventually be my wife to help me truly understand my ex-wife‚Äôs behavior because she use to deal with it too.

I basically set boundaries with my ex-wife that we aren‚Äôt friends, I don‚Äôt want to be friends, I‚Äôm tired of her going between wanting to be friends and then wanting nothing to do with me when she‚Äôs upset, and that we will only communicate regarding our daughter through text messages.

16,1fttw3i,AITA for cancelling travel plans with friend 3 days before the trip ,"Hi,

We've been friends for over a decade, and a friend, Sarah, recently invited me to join her on a two-week trip there after she had already purchased her tickets. While I hesitated initially due to safety concerns about traveling alone in a new country, Sarah reassured me that everything would be fine and that I wouldn‚Äôt be alone during the trip.

However, the situation has evolved quite a bit since I agreed to go. Over the past two months, there have been many changes regarding who will be joining us, which has left me feeling increasingly anxious. Initially, I was excited, but now I feel uncertain about the whole thing.

After I bought my plane tickets, I noticed that Sarah started to distance herself. I reached out to her several times to discuss our plans‚Äîwhere we would stay, which cities we‚Äôd visit, and how we‚Äôd navigate the trip together. A few weeks after I bought the tickets, she informed me that for the first three nights, I would need to find my own accommodation because she was bringing her boyfriend along. She assured me we would spend the days together, but it felt like a red flag that I‚Äôd be alone at night in an unfamiliar place.

Things continued to shift when she mentioned that more friends would be joining, including a couple I had never met and two others I was only vaguely familiar with. Then, just today, I learned that her mother and her mother‚Äôs boyfriend, along with his son, would also be joining midway through the trip. This sudden influx of people felt overwhelming, and I worried about how I would fit into the group.

Just last week, Sarah told me that the couple had canceled their plans, which was another red flag. Now, I find myself in a situation where I'm arriving in Albania late at night, alone at the airport, and spending the first three days in an apartment without anyone familiar around. After those three days, Sarah would spend a couple of days with me before leaving me alone again for a day to meet her mom at the airport.

On top of all that, she mentioned today we‚Äôd be traveling to three different cities during the trip, and she‚Äôs staying an extra four days after I leave. This means I‚Äôd need to figure out how to get back to the airport on my own, a journey that involves a lengthy bus ride (6h) with multiple transfers‚Äîsomething I‚Äôm not comfortable doing in a place where I don‚Äôt feel secure.

Given all these red flags, the constant changes, and the prospect of being alone in a foreign country, I‚Äôve made the difficult decision to cancel my trip. I haven‚Äôt told Sarah yet because I‚Äôm unsure how to approach the conversation. I feel a mix of anxiety and relief, but I can‚Äôt shake the feeling that I‚Äôm letting her down by backing out just three days before we were supposed to leave.

So, am I being unreasonable for canceling? I genuinely don‚Äôt feel safe or excited about this trip anymore, and I‚Äôm concerned about how Sarah will react.

I‚Äôm aware that it‚Äôs a codependent relationship but we‚Äôre both working on it separately. This typically wouldn‚Äôt be an issue as whenever we spend time together we make sure to keep our respective places clean, keep quiet and occasionally help house sit if either of our families are gone.

Were you not paying attention?‚Äù when he suddenly turns the question to me and asks why I didn‚Äôt have my car/why wasn‚Äôt I driving myself to work. This caught me off guard and I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explain why we were already together and why I was still over.

My BIL moved in with us about a couple of months ago, I was against it, but my wife wanted to help him so fine. 

On Sunday, my wife and her brother got into a fight because BIL refuses to pay his phone bill. I have him on my phone plan and WE pay his phone bill but when his phone broke he asked if he could buy one through our phone company and he would pay us back monthly I told him sure well it's been a year since then and he's paid for his phone 3 times in the entire year that he has had it and he only paid because my wife asked him for the money.

 So he's upset on Sunday because he feels like my wife shouldn't be asking him for the money and was literally yelling at her like a psycho. Saying that he pays it when she reminds but then in that same breath says that she needs to stop reminding him and he'll pay it when he pays it so basically he wants us to just pay for his phone and but okay with it which is NOT happening. 

The next day he's on the phone with their mom and sister talking crap about my wife because she's FINALLY putting her foot down and their mom is saying how my wife is just looking for attention and my SIL ended up messaging my wife telling her she's doing to much because she gave him a 30 days notice. 

She gave him a notice because since he's moved in he's been disrespectful, bringing drama to the house, bringing drug addicts to our house at all times of the night with no notice, he eats all our food and doesn't think he needs to replace it, using our laundry detergent and toilet paper and rarely replaces it and we don't have money to be paying for all his crap too we already pay for his damn phone bill so him yelling at her over the phone bill that he knows he's suppose to pay every month was the last straw for us.

 So, of course, I'm upset because, imo my SIL needs to stay in her place and not pick sides about a situation that she knows NOTHING about. So I messaged her saying that I would advise her to keep her mouth shut about situations she knows nothing about and instead of messaging my wife telling her she's doing to much to instead come for her brother who refuses to be dependable and the only one that is doing to much is her brother who came down stairs yelling like a psychopath over a bill that HE KNOWS he's supposed to be paying and I left it at that.

19,1fttf6s,AITA for not lending a game that just came out to my friend?,"I (M19) just recently bougth a Playstation 5 and was excited the play the new ""Astro Bot"" game, when it released a couple of weeks ago. I had pre-ordered the game and started playing on launch day.

A day or two later, a friend (M18) of mine asked me what I thought about the game so far and I told him it was amazing. He then went on to ask me to lend the game to him once I finished it myself.

I told him that I thought it would be unfair for him to basically play the game for free at launch while I had to pay 70 bucks for it. I then went on to make a offer to sell the game to him for half its price so we would both benefit from the situation as it would be just like us buying the game together with both our money combined. He got really mad at me and told me that I don't know how friendship works and that it would be a no-brainer to lend something to a friend. I told him that I wouldn't be lending the game to him for free that close to launch and he ended the conversation and hasn't talked to me since.

From my POV, I felt like he was trying to use our friendship in order to get to play the game for free at launch and afterwards tried gaslighting me into giving in by telling me that I'm a bad friend.

However, it has been bugging me this whole time and I am starting to second-guess myself. I know, arguing over a game is kinda childish and stupid and there are more important problems in the world, but I just have to know if what I said was unreasonable.

So, AITA for not lending a game that just came out to my friend?


EDIT:

Thank you for all the answers so far! I want to add a couple of things:

1. I realize that I used the word ""gaslighting"" inapproprietely in this situation. I'll think twice before using such a harsh word next time

2. I want to clarify that this situation does not reflect my general take on lending things to friends. I have never charged a friend for borrowing stuff from me. I do lend things to my friends for free, be it tools, games, etc.
What made this situation special to me was that the game had just come out a day ago at the time. That's why I thought he wanted to take advantage of our friendship to get the game for free at launch. But usually, I do not think my friends want to take advantage of me when they ask me to lend something to them.

3. Some of you recommended that I could've given the game to him and ask him if I could borrow a game from him in return the next time he buys a game that I want to play aswell. I think that is a way better way of handling this situation so I wanna thank you for that advise.",Asshole,2024-10-01,"AITA for not lending a game that just came out to my friend?

I told him that I thought it would be unfair for him to basically play the game for free at launch while I had to pay 70 bucks for it. I then went on to make a offer to sell the game to him for half its price so we would both benefit from the situation as it would be just like us buying the game together with both our money combined. He got really mad at me and told me that I don't know how friendship works and that it would be a no-brainer to lend something to a friend. I told him that I wouldn't be lending the game to him for free that close to launch and he ended the conversation and hasn't talked to me since.

From my POV, I felt like he was trying to use our friendship in order to get to play the game for free at launch and afterwards tried gaslighting me into giving in by telling me that I'm a bad friend.

However, it has been bugging me this whole time and I am starting to second-guess myself. I know, arguing over a game is kinda childish and stupid and there are more important problems in the world, but I just have to know if what I said was unreasonable.

So, AITA for not lending a game that just came out to my friend?


EDIT:

Thank you for all the answers so far! I want to add a couple of things:

1. I realize that I used the word ""gaslighting"" inapproprietely in this situation. I'll think twice before using such a harsh word next time

2. I want to clarify that this situation does not reflect my general take on lending things to friends. I have never charged a friend for borrowing stuff from me. I do lend things to my friends for free, be it tools, games, etc.
What made this situation special to me was that the game had just come out a day ago at the time. That's why I thought he wanted to take advantage of our friendship to get the game for free at launch. But usually, I do not think my friends want to take advantage of me when they ask me to lend something to them.

3. Some of you recommended that I could've given the game to him and ask him if I could borrow a game from him in return the next time he buys a game that I want to play aswell. I think that is a way better way of handling this situation so I wanna thank you for that advise.",1.0,0.09280720353126526,0,0
20,1ftt9fc,AITA for offering my friend concert tickets and then going back on the decision? ,"Title definitely makes me sound like an AH. Here's what happened.

For my boyfriend (M20) and I's (F20) anniversary, I got him concert tickets for his favorite artist. I bought 3 of them (he always goes to concerts with a friend of his, so I bought one for her too) but she couldn't go, so I had an extra ticket I didn't feel like selling. My friend, we'll call her Sam (F20) likes to go to concerts. I asked if she knew who the artist was, and she said no, but said if we couldn't find anyone else to go that she would go with us (in her own words, ""i won't say no to a free concert""). We couldn't find anyone else that my boyfriend knows who would want to go, so I offered for her to go with us. Recently, while talking to my other friend and ex roommate, David (M21) I found out that he's a fan of this artist to some extent. He likes a lot of his songs, and also likes going to concerts, so I mentioned that we (my bf and I) were going to the concert next week, and he said he'd love to be able to hear some of these songs live. The thought crossed my mind of offering to take him with us.

Today, I realized the concert is coming up soon, and texted Sam, telling her I discovered that David was a fan of this artist, and asked if she would be upset if I offered for him to go with us. She said no and that she wouldn't be upset, but now I'm worried that I made her upset just by the way she texted. I told her she can be honest with me and tell me if she'd be upset because I'd hate to take it away from her if she really wanted to go. It's not a stadium tour, nor did we buy any expensive outfits for it. My bf is driving us an hour away to the concert site, so no plane tickets were bought either, nor any hotel rooms. I didn't expect her to know the artist since he's not really her type of music. Sam and I went to a different concert about a week ago that she brought us too, but I bought my own ticket for it.

I'm autistic, late diagnosed, so it's really hard for me to sometimes understand if I'm doing something wrong based on social cues. Text is even harder to read tone on. I love Sam and I feel bad for even asking, but I didn't know David was a fan until after I offered to take Sam with us. I'm considering just lying and telling Sam that David said he couldn't go and taking her with us anyway, but I'm worried the damage has already been done. AITA? I'll clarify anything if need be.

  
edit: I feel it important to note that David and Sam are also friends, we're in a large friend group together in college. I wasn't thinking about taking a random ex-roommate that I never talk to anymore. I didn't offer the ticket to David, I wanted to check with Sam first so I didn't offer it to two different people at the same time.

21,1ftt7yw,AITA for telling my MIL to shut up about it already?,"My MIL has been talking constantly for the last four years about the relationship between my son (4) and stepson (16). My stepson's mom died when he was 5 and I married his dad when he was 11. He was 12 when my son was born and he has never been an interested big brother. I'm not sure what other way to put it. He's completely indifferent to my son and and doesn't call him a brother or half brother. He said no to being involved in the pregnancy and helping to name the baby. When my son was born he refused to hold him and has never held him. We don't have any photos of the two of them together because my stepson said no. 

He has been to grief therapy three times. When his mom died, when his dad and I remarried and last year. We did go to family therapy for 18 months as well and he opened up more about his feelings about everything. But he wasn't willing to work on trying to improve the dynamics overall.

From day one of it being obvious my stepson wasn't excited my MIL was saying it would be fine, he'd come around and just include him. My husband told her then that we couldn't force my stepson to decorate a nursery, pick toys and clothes for baby or to offer name ideas. That we could ask but he can say no and making him would do nothing. She wanted us to make him come to a scan. After our son was born she suggested we just give my stepson the baby, just make him take him, leave the baby in the room with him and walk away. All kinds of things. She also tried encouraging my stepson to interact with the baby in a very forceful way and my husband had to tell her to back off because at least he wasn't being hateful to the baby but he could grow to if she makes him resentful. We took a break and she apologized and backed off saying things to or in front of my stepson but she has continued to bring it up to my husband and me.

We have gone from leave them in a room together and drop the baby into his arms without saying anything to get him to babysit where he'll have to take care of his brother and interact with him. She told me I should send our son into my stepson's room every morning to wake him up and encourage interactions to that. My husband told her again to stop and she's not helping. Her response is he'll come around and we should keep trying.

MIL dropped some toys off for my son yesterday and I was home alone. So MIL decided to start the same topic up and I told her I didn't have time. But she said I should make time and figure out ways to get the boys bonded before it's too late. She said it's tragic that my stepson sees himself as an only child and there has to be something because it shouldn't be taking this long to get better. That's when I told her to shut up about it already. I told her we have heard all this for the last almost five years and it is not helpful or wanted.

22,1ftt15d,AITA for attending my ex's wedding? ,"I dont know if I am in the wrong or I am being gaslit. I (36F) attended my ex's (37m) wedding this weekend and I apparently failed a test.

My ex, Adam, and I dated in highschool, from the time we were 15 - 18, when we amicably split up to go to college in different states. Since college, we've kept in 'facebook familiar' contact, where we'd wish each other happy birthday, or congratulate each other on big milestones, but have had no other contact in the 20 or so years since then. About a year ago, I saw his engagement post on his facebook and congratulated him. A few months ago he facebook messaged me, asked how I was doing, and said he wanted to have a bit of a highschool get-together at his wedding since he was holding it in our hometown. He was inviting most of our mutual friend circle and he'd love for me to attend too. I hadnt seen most of these friends in over a decade, and I thought the idea sounded fun so I accepted the invitation.

The wedding was this past weekend....and it was incredibly normal. I attended with my husband, he got to meet all of my highschool friends and their partners and we had a great time. 

Sunday morning I wake up to a slew of facebook messages from my ex's new wife about my audacity to attend the wedding and how out of all his former girlfriends, I was the only one who failed the test. She said that CLEARLY you shouldnt attend an ex's wedding unless youre still hung up on them and how I must be planning to steal her new husband away. I was shocked, but also apologized if I had been unwelcomed and how I must have misunderstood as my reason for attending was to see old friends. She immediately responded and again said that no sane woman, with good intentions, would ever think it was okay to attend their ex's wedding. I again apologized if I was unwelcomed and hoped my presence hadnt detracted from her day. I then messaged my ex and apologized if I had misunderstood and hoped I hadnt caused any issues. He replied that he was glad I attended, the invitation had been sincere, there was no separate event planned, he was glad to see the old friend group and apologized about his new wifes messages. I left it at that, thinking it was a closed matter. A few hours later the new wife is messaging me again, complaining about how I was trying to manipulate her new husband to make her look crazy. I decided this was not a ship I wanted to sail on, took a screenshot of all her messages and my replies, sent them to the ex and said I was just going to go ahead and block them both so I couldnt be accused of inappropriate contact with anyone. 

Yesterday I started getting messages from the brides sister saying I poisoned my ex against his new wife and I should have kept the messages to myself. Im also being told I could have just avoided all of this by knowing I shouldnt attend my ex's wedding. I'm honestly not sure if I'm in the wrong or Im being gaslit by an insecure woman and her sister.

25,1ftq9pf,AITA for refusing to include another child in my math instruction for my son?,"My older son (12m) is very interested in math and has the aptitude to match.  Not a huge surprise, as I was the same and went on to get advanced degrees in a quantitative field.  Due to my wife's job, we relocated to a smaller town.  The public schools have become a mess since COVID, so we enrolled him in what is regarded as the academically strongest private school in the area.  It's OK, but not nearly as good as the public school in our old home city.  We supplemented son's math with an online program last year, at which he excelled.  Math at school was a total waste, but he could afford the lost time.  But he has a lot of interests (music, coding, bouldering, baseball, etc) and now homework load is increasing.  Time is scarce and he can't double up on math using evening time.  We asked the school if he could just use his math period to go to the library and get ahead on homework, but they refused (no one to supervise was the reason given).  And doing synchronous online math in the library won't work, because his schedule is ""block"" and the time of day he does math moves around.  My office (I'm remote) is a 3 minute walk from the school (on purpose - picked for drop-off ease!), so I asked if I could take charge of his math education, in the library.  School agreed.  

My son asked if I would consider including one classmate, ‚ÄúJane‚Äù.  He vouched for her math skill, interest and work ethic.  I asked her parents if I could review her assessment results and ‚Äúevaluate‚Äù her myself.  She wasn‚Äôt quite up to where my son is, but close enough that I could make it work, and she seemed very hard-working and enthusiastic.  So far, so good.  A few weeks into this, I get a call from the school.  The parents of another student, ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù, are upset that he was not offered a chance to participate.  My son‚Äôs sense was that Joe doesn‚Äôt like math especially and is poorly behaved.  I didn‚Äôt really want another kid, but I asked to see his assessments before I said no, because I assumed they‚Äôd show he wasn‚Äôt ready and I could decline on non-subjective grounds.  His parents shared, and indeed he is just at grade level.  

When I declined, his parents got quite upset.  They called the school to complain about ‚Äúfavoritism.‚Äù  They called and berated me, too; insisted that if I took ‚ÄúJane‚Äù then I needed to take all comers; that I was discriminating against their child (we are all same race/religion).  I wouldn‚Äôt budge.  They asked the school not to allow the accommodation for my son and Jane.  I told the school that if I got anymore guff, my kid was just going to do online school (he was admitted to a very high-level online program, but decided to only take one evening computer science class).  The parents are badmouthing me to all who will listen.

My older son (12m) is very interested in math and has the aptitude to match.  Not a huge surprise, as I was the same and went on to get advanced degrees in a quantitative field.  Due to my wife's job, we relocated to a smaller town.  The public schools have become a mess since COVID, so we enrolled him in what is regarded as the academically strongest private school in the area.  It's OK, but not nearly as good as the public school in our old home city.  We supplemented son's math with an online program last year, at which he excelled.  Math at school was a total waste, but he could afford the lost time.  But he has a lot of interests (music, coding, bouldering, baseball, etc) and now homework load is increasing.  Time is scarce and he can't double up on math using evening time.  We asked the school if he could just use his math period to go to the library and get ahead on homework, but they refused (no one to supervise was the reason given).  And doing synchronous online math in the library won't work, because his schedule is ""block"" and the time of day he does math moves around.  My office (I'm remote) is a 3 minute walk from the school (on purpose - picked for drop-off ease!), so I asked if I could take charge of his math education, in the library.  School agreed.  

My son asked if I would consider including one classmate, ‚ÄúJane‚Äù.  He vouched for her math skill, interest and work ethic.  I asked her parents if I could review her assessment results and ‚Äúevaluate‚Äù her myself.  She wasn‚Äôt quite up to where my son is, but close enough that I could make it work, and she seemed very hard-working and enthusiastic.  So far, so good.  A few weeks into this, I get a call from the school.  The parents of another student, ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù, are upset that he was not offered a chance to participate.  My son‚Äôs sense was that Joe doesn‚Äôt like math especially and is poorly behaved.  I didn‚Äôt really want another kid, but I asked to see his assessments before I said no, because I assumed they‚Äôd show he wasn‚Äôt ready and I could decline on non-subjective grounds.  His parents shared, and indeed he is just at grade level.  

When I declined, his parents got quite upset.  They called the school to complain about ‚Äúfavoritism.‚Äù  They called and berated me, too; insisted that if I took ‚ÄúJane‚Äù then I needed to take all comers; that I was discriminating against their child (we are all same race/religion).  I wouldn‚Äôt budge.  They asked the school not to allow the accommodation for my son and Jane.  I told the school that if I got anymore guff, my kid was just going to do online school (he was admitted to a very high-level online program, but decided to only take one evening computer science class).  The parents are badmouthing me to all who will listen.  At first I was silent, but now I respond that ‚ÄúJoe‚Äù did not demonstrate aptitude for advanced math in my view and would not be able to keep up.

28,1ftpl2b,AITA for trying to skip the bus line?,"Just based on the title, I can understand being in the wrong. I ride a bus to school in the city every morning and take the same bus back, its an hour and a half each way. There‚Äôs a social norm of forming a long line at the pickup in the morning while we all wait for the bus to arrive regardless of the huge amount of seating at the pickup spot. I‚Äôve had multiple foot surgeries on both my feet over the last two years and I spend a lot of time walking in the city, so my feet aren‚Äòt in the best shape, but I usually put up with standing in the long line with my heavy bag in the morning for 10+ minutes. One of the sesamoid bones in my left foot is separated into at least two pieces and is painful to stand on for very long (I have special shoe inserts to take pressure off it), and the big toe on my right foot has a locked joint that is painful as well.

So, this morning I was fed up with the line process and needed to sit down at the bench. When the bus arrived I decided to get on in front of the line because the bus stopped right in front of where I was sitting, and its nice for me to get a seat in the front because of my feet. When I began to get on, though, a man called out to me and told me to wait. He was kind of angry when he did, and I was caught off guard, so I stood aside and let everyone get on ahead of me. I don‚Äôt look like there‚Äôs anything physically wrong with me, so I get it, but I can‚Äôt figure out if I should have respected the line by staying seated and getting on last or if I had the right to get on first. People who need the handicap seats are supposed to get on first, and those seats are helpful for me, but I don‚Äôt use a cane anymore so I struggle with figuring out whether it‚Äôs okay for me to use those seats.

Should I have spoken up and gotten on first, or was the man right to call me out for jumping the line?

Edit: Thanks for commenting and voting everyone, you were all very helpful! If there's a day where I need a priority seat then I'll speak up about it regardless of embarassment. Until then, if i need to sit down, I'm going to let the person who I would have been standing behind in line know that I'm going to sit but I'll get on after them, hoping other people overhear me. I'm gonna have to accept that people will be mad about it, but I'll be vocal about my situation if someone calls out to me about it. On days I don't need to sit I'll get in line.

Standing still for long periods of time (10 minutes didn't seem long to me until my foot issues started) can sometimes effect my entire day, so being able to stand in line and not worry about this turned out to be a luxury that I took for granted in the past. The line is something that people just started doing, theres no official bus rule about forming one, so maybe when the weather turns people will move to the benches instead. I wish I didn't have to tell everyone about my situation in order to be accomodated on the days I need to be. Anyway!

I recently moved in with a housemate and they asked me to leave the house while they have online therapy. Their session is at 1pm, right in the middle of a day when I work freelance. I am actually also a therapist, and I see clients out of the house from 3:30pm, which means I need to leave about 2:30pm. I have a routine where I might go for a walk and do something out of the house in the morning, then relax at lunchtime before I see my clients.

33,1ftnjfx,AITA for buying a tank top? ,"I 16F have been experimenting with my style recently. I don't know what I feel comfortable with and like to wear, so therefore, I have been branching out from clothes I would usually buy (old money style etc)

So today, I went to the mall with my friends. We were in a store when I saw the most beautiful tank top. When I went to try it on, it was nothing like I usually would wear.

I fell in love with it, I felt confident and pretty, my friends were hyping me up, saying I look beautiful. Obviously, that brightened me, so I bought the tank top and went home feeling so proud and pretty.

When I got home, my mum (44F) asked me what I had bought. I showed her a photo and the clothing in hand and her smile immediately dropped.  
She told me that it was too revealing and inappropiate for my age and not suitable whatsoever. I understand that this may be because she comes from the Middle East and her views might be different to nowadays, but I'm still confused. I reassured her that I didn't buy it to be inappropiate and have it be revealing. I bought it because I found myself to be flattering in the top and I liked it.

She continued to berate me for buying such a thing, stating it was an embarassment to my family and bad on our reputation. She said that I will never wear clothes like such in public.

It was never my intention to offend my mother, I bought the clothes to be pretty and feel good about myself, but she didn't recieve that message.

My father (44M) came home, visibly uncomfortable and told me not to buy any more clothes that show any skin because he doesn't want others to see me as a piece of meat. As well as it is not suitable for me and only in certain cases can I wear such clothes.

I understand that it is not safe to wear clothes at such an age that are revealing in public. But I don't know, this whole encounter makes me feel very ashamed and I'm wondering if I'm the AITA because since, my parents have not been speaking to me, or when they do, they give me one word answers. My brother, 21M has been laughing and snickering whenever I talk and everyone just seems annoyed of me.

I also am wondering if AITA because of my ignorance, and that I embarassed my mother, because maybe my friends will tell their parents and my mother doesn't want to be known for having a daughter who does such things.

so, AITA?

Hello everyone! Thank you for all the sweet and really inspiring comments. You guys woke me up kind of. I didn't even realise this wasn't normal and was emotionally manipulative.

34,1ftm898,AITA For Reacting Angrily Towards My Brother‚Äôs Girlfriend After She Threw Me Under The Bus For What Seems Like Personal Gain? ,"My brother Mark (27m) was going on a retreat for 6 months. He asked me (24f) to be there for his gf Alyssa (20f). To start I moved out of state when I was 20 yrs old to have a relationship that I didn't have growing up with my mother & siblings (2 older sisters,1 older brother).  After moving I struggled to build a bond with them & still do. It‚Äôs really hard for me to trust people so I tend to close myself off so at times people assume I dislike them. I noticed that I was always the topic of conversation & it was never positive especially when it came to my mother & sisters.it was more noticeable after I stopped opening up to them all i would hear is them gossiping & judging me & it only got worse after my dad passed & they maliciously use that as a weapon against me to hurt me I‚Äôve tried communicating about how it makes me feel & its not fair that they gang up on me then they wonder why I don't interact or speak to them. Even when I cut all contact I was still involved in the drama that my mother created. I‚Äôm closer to my older brother Mark than any of my other siblings. We even tell people that we‚Äôre twins just born 3 yrs apart as a joke because we literally were attached to the hip haha
I currently live at my step father Matt‚Äôs house (he treats me as if im his own child & is actually a father figure to me) & despite my mother having an on & off relationship with Matt, she comes & goes often despite but living in the same home I haven‚Äôt spoken to her for over a year because of what she did to me then proceeded to act as if she knew nothing & didn‚Äôt have anything to do with it & made herself the victim.  
Anyways, one day I overheard my sister Grace & my mother speaking in the kitchen about my brother's ex Chelsey (she was extremely toxic & put my brother through so much) coming over to my sisters house the previous night unannounced & drinking being stupid & also, talking about my mother getting Chelsey a job as a caregiver to one of my mothers friends. 
This gets me upset because WHY THE HELL DO THEY STILL KEEP CONTACT WITH HER knowing all the terrible things she did to Mark & Grace! Chelsey slept with my sister Grace's baby daddy‚Ä¶ not once but several times‚Ä¶. NOT TO MENTION Grace is currently still with her baby daddy so for the life of me I cannot underst& why my mother & Grace let Chelsey have access to them, especially when Chelsey uses them just to get to my brother or whatever personal gain she has on her agenda. 
A  week later my brother's current gf alyssa came to stay at my stepfathers house for a while & when i got off of work & got Home i talked to alyssa for about 35-45 mins. I had told Alyssa about what I had overheard & to be careful about telling her business to my Grace & my mother as they both are alcoholics & cannot control themselves when they drink & Chelsey knows this so that‚Äôs when she takes that opportunity to get them to tell her anything & everything she wants to know. I was just trying to look out for Alyssa. I personally don't like my business being told especially to an ex partner. I also told her  that I wasn't trying to cause drama, stir the pot, or be negative. I was only trying to look out for her. Alyssa told me that she already KNEW about the family having contact with the ex & that the ex also messaged her 2 weeks prior but that she isn‚Äôt negative & is ‚ÄúOpen Minded‚Äù. I then explained why I'm not around as much because I work & mostly stay in my room to avoid my mother as much as possible & that in general I truly stay to myself . I made it more than clear that if she approached my mother & sister that not directly point the finger at me because they would instantly take it as negative as it came from me & I really don't want drama. This conversation was meant to be more as a heads up or advice due to personal experience & not meant to be vocalized. 
Well not a freakin day later came to find out that alyssa did exactly what i told her not to do‚Ä¶ im at work & my sister starts blowing up my phone cussing me out, trying to fight, & said i was talking shit. 
I told her I wasn't talking shit & that if she wanted me to I would repeat what I said to Alyssa to her face & That she is getting upset over nothing. 
At that same time i texted Alyssa & comes to find out alyssa was sending screenshots of my text because at 9:08pm i sent a text to Alyssa saying ‚Äúi was saying my POV‚Äù only for me to get a text at 9:10pm from my sister Grace saying ‚ÄúWHAT POV!?‚Äù & then to receive a response from Alyssa at 9:11PM. It doesn't take much to know what's going on when I knew Alyssa was at my step dads & my sister was at her house. 
I can acknowledge that I can't control how my sister & mom react to what alyssa said but I damn well made it more than clear what would happen & it wasn't like I dropped a bomb on to her BECAUSE SHE TOLD ME SHE HAD ALREADY KNOWN!? I don't like nor speak to my brother's ex gf so Alyssa gains nothing from telling me she knew if she actually didn‚Äôt.  
I want to point out Alyssa's text messages sent to me because she contradicts herself. It really hurts me because she created this drama & dragged me into it when I specifically told her not to name drop me. My brother was gonna be away for 6 months he asked me to be there for his gf & i really did try to be there especially after she started the drama but she ghosted me & became closer to my mother & 2 older sisters in such a cruel way by targeting me.

What I Find Contradicting & Questionable In The Text Alyssa‚Äôs  Sent Me.
-She has heard about Chelsey still keep in contact prior to my conversation with her
-She said she doesn‚Äôt care about it yet. Was curious as to why I just disliked Chelsey. Alyssa also said she wasn‚Äôt Trippin especially after Chelsey messaged her so the things Alyssa tells me after this isn‚Äôt valid.
- Alyssa said she‚Äôs rather ask than the question & be mad but to point the finger at me directly when I made it more than clear & face-to-face conversation with her that I do not want any problems & if she does approach my mother & sister to please not mention me or say, I directly said it because they would immediately get offensive & will take it negative.
-She had the nerve to apologize for making me feel a type of way & sorry that things are so hard when she created the drama & wants me to be OK with that? 
-She claims to not wanting  be ‚Äúblindsided‚Äú but yeah, how can she be? She knew about Chelsey  still keeping contact.
-She also said she didn‚Äôt have an idea of what would happen, but I did tell her & I made it more than clear. What would happen because of how I was currently being treated. she can‚Äôt play that little innocent game with me.
-I repeatedly told her I wasn‚Äôt trying to stir the pot nor cause problems, but I wanted to let her know to be careful because Chelsey was coming around & especially after alyssa telling me Chelsey messaged her so i wanted alyssa to be careful  
-Alyssa may have nothing to do with my relationship with mother & sisters but she damn well knew that this would be a huge argument when it came to me. I made it very clear & I repeated it so she can‚Äôt say she ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù because there is no other way to say it when it was simple. Nothing more nothing less.
-The fact that alyssa ‚Äúwanted to clear things up‚Äú doesn't mean point a finger at me as if I was the only one that has told her about it when clearly she already heard about it prior to my conversation with her. I only had one conversation with her. so I don‚Äôt know why she‚Äôs acting br& new as if she didn‚Äôt know.
-Alyssa made me come out much worse than it was as if I was talking shit which makes me think the worst of her & her character. It seems to me she wants some kind of personal gain by throwing me under the bus as she more knew that I was being targeted & treated a certain way, & she took the opportunity to use it as a way to get closer with everyone as it will make it a main topic & something to have in common. It has caused me  so much stress because of this pointless situation that shouldn't even be a problem in the first place. Looks like she got what she wanted though hanging out with our sisters (going out with my sister that lives the same state me & even traveling out of state to visit my other sister THAT SHE LITERALLY only met for 3 days before when she came to visit then decided to leave out of state with her) & my mother & was  living with my older sister out of state for a month then traveling to vegas then back to our state going out smoking, drinking, & doing shrooms, making post calling each other ‚Äúsisters‚Äù & while im was home dealing with all the bs she started as it affected me & what looks like not her at all. Everyone is beefing with me 10 times more than usual as Alyssa continued to bond with everyone else. (I need to add that my brother left her with access to his banking & gave her a spending limit & before he left he messaged me  that if i need money to ask alyssa. He told her if i ever needed money & if i ask for money for her to send it to me. The ONE time i asked she told me she didn't have access to his money‚Ä¶ it hurts me because she was going out spending my brothers money carelessly especially with my oldest sister jessica who NEVER has money may i add. Only caused me to think my brother was upset at me) 
-Lastly, I cannot stress this enough. Alyssa already knew about what I told her & I told her what would happen if she involved me & that I wasn‚Äôt coming from a bad place. It sucks.
Now we get to 2 nights ago after 6 months my brother finally arrived back & I told him I needed to talk with him & then with his girlfriend. He told me she was too tired so I waited til the next day come to find out once again she said she was too tired to come out & said she was napping. I went into the house to get something to drink come to find out she's watching movies in the living room. I just want to mention that I'm not a violent person but I'm also not the type of person that lets people walk over me & use me however they please because of my past. I especially hate when people talk behind my back instead of being real. As soon as she saw me, she walked outside to where my brother & boyfriend were talking. I'm not proud of what I did but I can't say I wasn't feeling angry over all these months especially when she seemed to be having the time of her life meanwhile i was dealing with the aftermath of what she caused by name dropping me when I specifically told her what would happen then for her to say she didn't know that would happen. I told her to tell me why she did what she did & that I want to hear her side from the very beginning. Thinking there could be some miscommunication I wanted to give her a chance before I decided whether or not to go off on her. All she said was ‚ÄúI feel like you were mad‚Ä¶‚Äù & i snapped i angrily told her how she made me feel all these months because of what she did & how she downplayed the situation. I did raise my voice but it cracked as I held back tears & I angrily told her to start from the beginning & if she doesnt know where that is then ill tell her. For her to start from that night when we had that conversation & I was gonna give her a chance to start but I dont like how she started it because she avoided me & didn't even tell me hi or even acknowledge me since my brother came home first of all so now I‚Äôm gonna tell her where to start, which is the night that I had a conversation with her that made her turn around & put the finger at me causing this mess when all i was trying to do was look out for her. Her eyes went wide & she was sat on the ground by the curb & she got up teary eyed & started walking into the house. I followed her saying ‚Äúwhat, why are you walking away? I'm trying to talk to you! Why are you walking away! if you didn't do anything wrong?‚Äù & even though that's my older brother's girlfriend, if it wasn't for my boyfriend & brother intervening I would have honestly smacked her because of the disrespect. I should feel valid for being upset. Not feel like shit for something I didn't create. 
AITA for thinking she did all this for her gain? Threw me under the bus, all so she can be on my family's good side &  have them like her & want to spend time with her over my brother's ex. I can agree I shouldn‚Äôt have snapped the way I did but I just had all of this pent-up emotions inside me especially when I already have a bone to pick with my mother & this just added to it & what truly got me mad was the fact that I have trouble expressing my feelings & i'm a mess at  explaining how I feel (I struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder & C-PTSD not to add that i hate confrontation) so my boyfriend knows me well enough to be able to help me explain better, but my brother wouldn‚Äôt let him speak. My brother said he wanted to hear it from me directly, but yet he was speaking on Alyssa‚Äòs behalf, which wasn‚Äôt fair. Not even 5 minutes of Alyssa going inside the house & me following her then coming back out Alyssa came back outside & walked by the carport while we were by the side of the house & i knew she was listening which upset me more. My brother started to crying telling me that he didn't know that asking me to do one thing would turn into all of this & that he should have told Alyssa that anything I told her she shouldn‚Äôt repeat & I countered that with what he had told me the night before about him telling her what to do when it came to spending his money carelessly & that there was a lot of miscommunication there & even when he told her to do something, she wouldn‚Äôt do it so taking that into consideration what I said & different, especially when I‚Äôve already told her not to repeat what I said & she specifically said it, but she had to know & didn‚Äôt want to be blindsided, regardless of what I said, be disregarded either way. Idk what to do or how to get my brother to underst& that Alyssa being a ‚Äúknucklehead‚Äù can only get her so far & it's just an excuse that isnt Valid. She still can‚Äôt apologize. I even apologized for snapping at her when I texted her back in June when my sister was going off on me. I shouldn't be or feel sorry. 
TLDR- brothers gf talked about our private convo which was meant to be taken as advice & threw me under the bus to get our family to like her. Now everyone's upset at me. Am I wrong for thinking she did this all intentionally just to get closer to my family knowing I have a rocky relationship with them?

Only caused me to think my brother was upset at me) 
-Lastly, I cannot stress this enough. Alyssa already knew about what I told her & I told her what would happen if she involved me & that I wasn‚Äôt coming from a bad place. It sucks.
Now we get to 2 nights ago after 6 months my brother finally arrived back & I told him I needed to talk with him & then with his girlfriend. He told me she was too tired so I waited til the next day come to find out once again she said she was too tired to come out & said she was napping. I went into the house to get something to drink come to find out she's watching movies in the living room. I just want to mention that I'm not a violent person but I'm also not the type of person that lets people walk over me & use me however they please because of my past. I especially hate when people talk behind my back instead of being real. As soon as she saw me, she walked outside to where my brother & boyfriend were talking. I'm not proud of what I did but I can't say I wasn't feeling angry over all these months especially when she seemed to be having the time of her life meanwhile i was dealing with the aftermath of what she caused by name dropping me when I specifically told her what would happen then for her to say she didn't know that would happen. I told her to tell me why she did what she did & that I want to hear her side from the very beginning. Thinking there could be some miscommunication I wanted to give her a chance before I decided whether or not to go off on her. All she said was ‚ÄúI feel like you were mad‚Ä¶‚Äù & i snapped i angrily told her how she made me feel all these months because of what she did & how she downplayed the situation. I did raise my voice but it cracked as I held back tears & I angrily told her to start from the beginning & if she doesnt know where that is then ill tell her. For her to start from that night when we had that conversation & I was gonna give her a chance to start but I dont like how she started it because she avoided me & didn't even tell me hi or even acknowledge me since my brother came home first of all so now I‚Äôm gonna tell her where to start, which is the night that I had a conversation with her that made her turn around & put the finger at me causing this mess when all i was trying to do was look out for her. Her eyes went wide & she was sat on the ground by the curb & she got up teary eyed & started walking into the house. I followed her saying ‚Äúwhat, why are you walking away? I'm trying to talk to you! Why are you walking away! if you didn't do anything wrong?‚Äù & even though that's my older brother's girlfriend, if it wasn't for my boyfriend & brother intervening I would have honestly smacked her because of the disrespect. I should feel valid for being upset. Not feel like shit for something I didn't create. 
AITA for thinking she did all this for her gain? Threw me under the bus, all so she can be on my family's good side &  have them like her & want to spend time with her over my brother's ex. I can agree I shouldn‚Äôt have snapped the way I did but I just had all of this pent-up emotions inside me especially when I already have a bone to pick with my mother & this just added to it & what truly got me mad was the fact that I have trouble expressing my feelings & i'm a mess at  explaining how I feel (I struggle with Borderline Personality Disorder & C-PTSD not to add that i hate confrontation) so my boyfriend knows me well enough to be able to help me explain better, but my brother wouldn‚Äôt let him speak. My brother said he wanted to hear it from me directly, but yet he was speaking on Alyssa‚Äòs behalf, which wasn‚Äôt fair. Not even 5 minutes of Alyssa going inside the house & me following her then coming back out Alyssa came back outside & walked by the carport while we were by the side of the house & i knew she was listening which upset me more. My brother started to crying telling me that he didn't know that asking me to do one thing would turn into all of this & that he should have told Alyssa that anything I told her she shouldn‚Äôt repeat & I countered that with what he had told me the night before about him telling her what to do when it came to spending his money carelessly & that there was a lot of miscommunication there & even when he told her to do something, she wouldn‚Äôt do it so taking that into consideration what I said & different, especially when I‚Äôve already told her not to repeat what I said & she specifically said it, but she had to know & didn‚Äôt want to be blindsided, regardless of what I said, be disregarded either way. Idk what to do or how to get my brother to underst& that Alyssa being a ‚Äúknucklehead‚Äù can only get her so far & it's just an excuse that isnt Valid. She still can‚Äôt apologize. I even apologized for snapping at her when I texted her back in June when my sister was going off on me. I shouldn't be or feel sorry. 
TLDR- brothers gf talked about our private convo which was meant to be taken as advice & threw me under the bus to get our family to like her. Now everyone's upset at me. Am I wrong for thinking she did this all intentionally just to get closer to my family knowing I have a rocky relationship with them?

He and I went to uni together for undergrad. Very close friends, he was always a bit annoying though. We later moved to the UK to study at different unis in London.

Since our other friends were in different countries and he was the only person I knew so we became even closer friends. Even before moving to London, he would ask me about how guys should be strong enough to help women and what if a woman is being attacked and I can't do anything to protect her, most importantly, how Andrew Tate is a nice guy. He wanted to be masculine and unfortunately couldn't see the difference b/w being masc and being toxic. I tried to be as reasonable as I could and tried to explain my POV.

In one instance he said ""I saw your uni was having a pole dance society event. Dude guys were also doing it. How can guys do that? It's so fked up."" This stuff went on for months.

Him being one of my closest friends and THE closest friend in London, I felt comfortable around him. I had not yet come out to anyone except one of our common friends, who is also my best friend. I tried to tell him many times that I'm gay but I never could. Even when I was drunk af somehow my brain would stop me from saying it. I always thought he'd not like it, not just because of his masculine ideas but also because when I would joke and say something kinda gay he would be visibly uncomfortable. I thought maybe I'll let him know someday.

I went to my first Pride parade in London and posted a photo on my close friends story on IG. He proceeded to use a fairly unpleasant word used to describe transgender people in our language to say ""Bro why did you go to their parade?"" I lost it that day and slowly stopped talking to him. I tried to give him time and I tried to ease him into less conservative ideas. Even his ideas of feminism are something out of Instagram comments. I know he's not super homophobic but he doesn't seem like a person who loves the idea either. But over time his ideas of toxic masculinity being good and that one pretty homophobic comment made me lose it and I stopped talking to him. I decided that having recently come out I want to focus on exploring my sexuality, make new friends, and start new relationships. He called me a lot of times over the past few months, but I haven't responded.

I looked at my calendar and we were looking at holidays avoiding the date of her wedding.
At the very last minute, we realised we could fly to our chosen holiday from our local airport instead of a London airport, which was perfect for us and we booked it. I forgot, however, to check if the flights were the same days, and they're one day different, meaning we'll fly back on the day of her wedding.

I realised immediately after booking but the call centre for the holiday place was closed.

After calling them this morning, to shorten the holiday is going to cost ¬£305 in fees, to change it will cost ¬£450, or ¬£600 to cancel!

In the 4 years I've been with my boyfriend, I haven't seen Kate in person, as we now live at different ends of the country. I've only mentioned her a handful of times, and we probably only talk every couple of months. But she's still my longest friend and godparent to my eldest daughter. Because my boyfriend doesn't see her as one of my best friends, he said he'd be very upset if I paid the difference myself, as I owe him money for other things.

As long as the flight isn't delayed, I can still make most of the wedding but I'll miss the actual ceremony by 10 minutes. If the flight is delayed, I'll potentially miss it all.

I just explained it all to Kate and she's really upset and although she didn't explicitly say it, I think she is expecting me to change the holiday so I can make the ceremony.

My mom had three kids with her first husband and my dad had two with his first wife.

My half siblings are all 9+ years older than me.

My parents never really had the typical marriage and they never blended families. They married for a roommate situation and since I'm here, they had sex at least one time. They never forced their kids to interact and never tried to bond with their stepkids. My dad told me none of the kids wanted a stepfamily so they didn't give them one and instead focused on making the best of things that they had while enjoying adult companionship. My mom had her family and my dad had his and the two sides, even when living under one roof, never merged or did anything together. And when I was born neither side wanted me. I was seen as another part of the ""not family but roommate deal"".

My parents don't share a bedroom. They don't go on dates. They play puzzles together and watch TV together and eat together sometimes. But if one of their kids has a birthday, the parent goes without spouse. They take turns visiting their own kids for a few nights. I stay with the parent who doesn't go for visits.

It's not like he's a truly awful person. We just absolutely have nothing in common. I keep trying to reach out to make some sort of connection but I always get shut down with a change of conversation to something he's doing, or a mildly rude comment. Like the last one, which honestly sort of broke the camel's back, I was genuinely really looking forward to sharing some music with him I'd been working on. He works with music, and this was (so I thought) the kind of music he'd like. I played a couple of songs to him and he turned round and said 'I know you're trying to share this thing with me but can we have some good music please?'.

My parents got divorced when I was 16, but I wanted them to get one since I was 9. My mom made no excuses for him and told me some stuff which she probably shouldn't, like how he split bills and refused to pay for my stuff. Honestly I grew up scared of him because when they argued he would get incandescent with rage, then would storm out, cool down, come back and ignore us for a few weeks.

He did step up when I was in college - I had mental health issues and he was retired whilst my mom still worked so in the middle of the day if I was in crisis I'd call him.

But now I'm better, and I've got an amazing fianc√©...I probably don't call him as much as I should. But every time I do there's always some snide comment that digs in and makes me feel like shit for the next few days. I'm sick of it. My fianc√© is surely sick of picking up the pieces.

I am a very concerned friend so I absolutely did not want Jenny to do it and I told her straightforward, at the end of the small conversation she said she would do it after school to Beatrice while completely ignoring me. 

So I went to my school councelor and told them that this was going to happen because I don't want my friend, who I also consider to be my best friend, to do ketamine. The councelor said by not name dropping Beatrice, we could not prevent this from happening in the future, so I was kind of left with no choice but to name drop because otherwise they would do this some other time in the near future.

In the end, a day after I got kicked out of the friend group, Jenny is negative towards me, Beatrice hates me and I am now a snitch, but I know I have good intentions at heart and I know I'm being a good friend by making sure they don't make this big mistake, the argument she used was that it's none of my business and that I should respect her choices, but she's underage, she isn't even allowed to purchase vapes and stuff and she thinks she is old enough to make a decision like that.

44,1ftjm46,AITA for accepting a gift for my birthday?,"Hello! Just for clarification, I'm making this for my friend because the story is just insane to me. This is a bit long.

A bit of background for aunt (#2)
From what I recall, his mother supported aunt (#2) even when she asked for money to buy groceries, as well as lending her an E-bike because his mother didn't know how to ride one. All of that until aunt (#2) could get a stable job. Their relationship was as close as siblings can be. 

Now him and his family just moved to a new house and they're all far away from each other. Aunt (#2) still had the E-bike, so his mother wanted it back, but aunt (#2) didn't want to because his mother didn't even know how to ride it and they used it more. 

A few months into the fight and I don't know how but his aunt suddenly gained the support of a friend(?) and moved to a nicer house and everything. So the aunt throws a house warming party, posted it on Facebook. His mother thought that the aunt was bragging about her new house and she wanted the E-bike even more then. 

After a few more months, they successfully got the E-bike back and everything seemed to be fine, the mother and aunt (#2) still ignoring each other though. 

Then my friend's birthday came. Knowing this, his aunt (#1) asked him what he wanted when he visited aunt (#2)'s house. ""Shoes"" was all he said, nothing specific as far as I know. 

As he arrived home, his mother noticed the box he was carrying. Asking what it was, he just said ""aunt(#1)'s birthday present to me"" because she was the one that gave it to him. 

Him and his mother just got into a fight because his aunt (#1) gifted him an expensive pair of shoes for his birthday. Although, according to his mother, aunt (#1) wouldn't even spend that much on her or her own daughter if she could. Suspicious by all of this, his mother called aunt (#1) and asked if she had bought the shoes for him, turns out that she didn't, but aunt (#2) did.

So his mother was angry at him because he hurt her feelings by simply accepting the gift. (That's what made me think that this story was crazy).
Obviously confused, my friend asked what the relation of his mother and aunt(#2)'s fight was to the gift that he received. Saying that he didn't have any part in their feud, his mother became even more angry. She talked about how her own son didn't respect her and how he didn't care about her feelings, how he 'betrayed' her. Now his mother asked him to move out and to ""join his aunt"".

I personally think the situation is childish. Seriously, asking your kid to move out because he got a gift for HIS BIRTHDAY from HIS AUNT. He talked to me about how he felt like his mother was separating him from the rest of their family.
The situation is crazy and I honestly think they need to talk to somebody about this feud.

45,1ftjhic,"AITA for refusing to spend a lot of money on gifts ""from the baby"" to my stepdaughters?","My husband (33m) has two daughters (9 and 8) from a previous marriage. He shares custody of them with his ex wife Mina (33f). They divorced 7 years ago. I met him 5 years ago and we're almost 2 years married now. This is my (30f) first biological child.

Things are tense between us and Mina. I mostly stay out of discussions between them because she does not like it and ultimately, the girls don't need more tension between their two homes for the sake of me showing up. That doesn't mean I don't discuss things with my husband or that I'm uninvolved. But when it comes to communicating with their mom, I don't insist that my voice be heard equally like the two bio and legal parents. My husband would like me to be an equal part of it. But tension is significantly less since I made the decision not to sit in on these discussions, which I would only go to support my husband but even that was something Mina disliked.

I bring this up because this is being taken into consideration on this point.

A few weeks before I found out I was pregnant, the girls told my husband Mina was pregnant. Mina is single, for anyone who asks, and is pregnant via a donor. They were really excited. When we told them we were expecting they weren't excited. They see their mom having a baby as different than me having a baby with their dad. We get along so this was a surprise. But they don't see me as a parent so them the baby isn't a sibling. While their mom's baby has just their mom so they're ""real siblings"". This is something being addressed via therapy and my husband and I talking to them.

Now onto the gifts. Mina bought the girls roughly $500 worth of gifts each that they'll get ""from the baby"" when she's born. My husband wanted us to do this too and he told me we need to match it at least because they already prefer their sister from mom and still don't see their brother from us as a real sibling. Neither baby is born yet btw. I told him I didn't think we should spend a lot on gifts like that. My husband said he's worried it's just another negative for our son if we don't. My husband's parents found out through MIna about the gifts and they told us we better do better than that. I told them it was an insane amount of money to spend for this. They accused me of not caring about the girls and not valuing a good relationship OR a good sibling relationship between them and my son. They think it's unreasonable to not want to spend a lot of money in these circumstances.

Back in June, one of her cats had passed away, and all of us in the friend group knew how much she loved that cat. Fast forward to mid July, her father had brought home a little kitten that he found at his workplace. She was pretty mad at her dad because she feels he should have just sent the kitten to the shelter instead of bringing it home.

All of us were doting on the kitten cause it's really cute and small. On the second day of her taking care of the cat, she'd mentioned that the cat has some intestinal problems and wasn't eating right, and might not survive. Still, she continued to share photos and videos of the kitten playing and jumping around. One of us asked her if she was going to keep it. She said that she might not keep it as she still has another cat that's pretty territorial. At this point, I didn't think she'd keep the kitten as it's already hard on her that her last cat had passed away, she'd mentioned her other cat was territorial and now this kitten is sick.

Later that day, I sent the photo of the kitten to my mum. The convo went like this;  
Me: My friend got a new kitten lolol can we keep it \[photo of kitten\]  
Mum: Hell no, you know how I feel about keeping cats at home

I screenshotted it and sent it to my friend to show my mum's funny response, as we all knew my mum loves cats but can't be bothered to actually take care of one. For context, I always show my mum my friends' pets anyways cause she likes to see the photos.

I was ignored for super long. I asked her what's wrong and she didn't want to talk about it. She didn't reply to my messages but replied to other friends and was posting online as usual.

Eventually she told me that I was being ""insensitive"" and that it was ""obvious that she wanted to keep the kitten"" and that I ""didn't care about her feelings or the kitten's health, as long as I get to have it to myself"".

My friend of 5 years, of whom I spoke is the DM (Dungeon Master) of the group. Basically he has full say over what is allowed and not allowed within the fantasy setting our characters are in. Anyway, about 2 months ago I was invited by my buddy to join the campaign as they were struggling for consistent players, and I wanted to play, so I joined.

A few sessions ago I did something kind of bold which landed most of the party, including myself in hot water, resulting in the group getting fined. Save for one individual who made off like a cockroach.

The following sesh, I had a poor day leading up to it and was frustrated and in a bad mood due to outside factors. I behaved poorly when things didnt go my way and got a bit argumentative, before rage quitting for the evening. The following session I apologized for my behavior.

The group was forgiving and life carried on.

This guy IRL is probably in his early to mid 20s and plays the game like he's the main character and leader of the group, and makes 90% of the decisons for the group. 

I came into this game with the attitude of ""its their game, I'm just a side character, or reoccurring character for now"" and I figured I'd be more vocal the more established my character became, and the more of an asset I was to the group. 

This group of people, while mostly friendly, arent tactile thinkers, so I've felt a bit more inclined to try and give advice to them when I feel its needed, to help them out.

51,1fti6pw,AITA for telling my friend about my other friends talking behind her back?,"I have a friend, A, who has always been supportive and overall a great friend to me. I have 2 other friends, B and C, and B is also friends with A but C isn't. B told C and I that A has been fighting with a friend of hers, D, for about a week now and D has been ignoring her, and that A snapped at another friend, E, for no reason. C started talking about how A can be really condescending and full of herself, and she always needs to be the center of attention, and B agreed.

All this seemed very out of character for A to me, she's never come across that way to me and I believe if she is told she's doing something wrong she will try to correct her behavior. I asked if she had apologized to D or E or if they talked at all and B and C said no.

This all seemed incredibly biased to me, and I wanted to get A's side of the story, since l'm sure she wouldn't act that way on purpose. I texted A and asked if she was okay and if she would tell me her perspective on the situation. She responded very confused and said she didn't know what I was talking about, so I told her what B and C had told me had happened, and she said it wasn't true. She also asked who told me that and I told her it was B and C.

This is where I think I'm in the wrong, I kind of threw B and C under the bus. However, the entire conversation had been very calm and polite, she seemed like she was only confused and trying to figure out why they thought she was fighting with D and E, and afterward she thanked me for telling her, said she would talk to D and E to clear up any issues they might have that she didn't know about, and asked me to tell my friends to stop spreading misinformation. I agreed and sent B and C a text telling them I had asked A for her side of the story, that the situation was resolved and she wanted them to stop talking about it.

Later I found out that A had sent an angry text paragraph to B right after my conversation with her (she wasn't really mad at C because she didn't know them, but B is our mutual friend) which made B really upset. I wasn't expecting A to do this because of how calm and understanding she was in her conversation with me, but I sent a text to B apologizing for throwing blame onto them, even though it was accidental, and they still haven't responded to me. Later C responded to my initial text about how I had talked to A saying I shouldn't have done that and I was in the wrong, but I don't think I was.

I think I should have handled it a bit more sensitively and made sure A understood the misunderstanding wasn't B's fault, but I was trying to check in on my friend who was being shit talked by my other friends because I didn't want to believe rumors about her without hearing the full story (especially because the rumors ended up being false) which I don't think I was wrong to do. I think B and C were more in the wrong for talking badly about her like that, especially because B is supposed to be her friend and C doesn't even know her personally.

53,1fthzdp,AITA For taking my neighbours clothes out of the washing machine?,"Hello,

First, sorry if I write broken english, I'm not super good at it.

I live in an apartment complex (basically a building that has many floors with many apartments).

Since the apartments aren't big, it's not really possible to have your own laundry room with a washing machine and a drier. So we basically share a common room that is available in each of the floors.

The way it works it's simple: There is a whiteboard in the door of that room where you need to write your name in a calendar divided into time slots. This is a way to coordinate all the neighbours so the person that has ""booked"" the time slot can use the room.

Basically yesterday I woke up in the morning and I booked the 16h-19h slot by writing my name and my flat number.
I work 9 to 5 so I came back home at 17:30, took a shower and I was ready to use the laundry at 18 (which falls also under my time slot).

So when I accessed the room, I noticed that the washing machine and the drier were taken.
In normal circumstances I wouldn't have minded, I would have just waited for it to finish.
The problem was that it was already 18h, my slot was almost over and another neighbour had booked the 19h-22h slot so I didn't want to risk invading his time slot.

I had no idea who the person who took the washing machine was. There was no note, no name, no indication, so I had no way of contacting them.
The only option I had is to take this person's clothes out, my time slot was almost over.
Obviously the clothes were still dirty and wet. I just put everything in a plastic bag and started a program for me.

30 minutes later, the guy came in.
He obviously saw what I have done and started getting confrontational: ""Why the hell have you taken out my clothes!?"".
My only answer was: ""Yeah, because I booked this time-slot, can't you see my name is in there?"".
His argument was always: ""Why haven't you come at 16h? I though you weren't going to come!""
I explained him multiple times that I was at work. And that doesn't matter, the entire 3h time slot was booked so he had no right to use it.
I told him that the next one 19h-22h was also booked by another neighbour so he was more than welcome to book the 22h-01h (or any of the other slots available the next day).

He said that he would call the landlord and complain.
Today, I received a call from my landlord, they said that what I did wasn't ok, and that I have now a ""red card"", and the next time someone complains about this I will be kicked out for disrupting behaviour.
Like, WTF? Am I the only one who respects the booking system that YOU have implemented?

I don't think this is fair.
What do you guys think?
What would have you done in this situation?
Is there something I am missing?

I understand how that can be annoying and selfish but at the end of the day this man is a good person. I don‚Äôt think he did it on purpose. He said his dad chose to see his kids game last minute. Also for context he hadn‚Äôt seen his kiddos in about 2 years because of his BM. 

Anyway my husband got pissed and said I was supposed to use my friend to get money then block him. I thought that was crazy but agreed so I could talk to him more. Well today my husband caught on and made me block him . 

I didn‚Äôt think this was fair because they had a falling out doesn‚Äôt mean our friend and I did. My husband said it was our friend or him so I chose my husband and was heart broken that I lost my best friend. Later last night my husband realized how sad not having him made me. He said it wasn‚Äôt fair for me to have to loose a friend because of him. My husband has a friend I can‚Äôt stand but I don‚Äôt tell him he can‚Äôt hang out with . 

My husband said I could unblock him and apologized for the whole ordeal. My question is am I an asshole for asking my friend to be in his life he was blocked for a couple hours.

1) J asked me what I was doing there 

2) J who is quite smart did a bit of math in his head and asked if it was his baby

3) my sister accused me of trying to steal her boyfriend and then started ranting about everything she thinks I‚Äôve done to ruin her life. 

Needless to say the wedding was no longer about the bride and somehow I got uninvited from every family event and some people are even asking for the gifts they sent for the baby shower.

One of my main issues is that he doesn‚Äôt listen to me or show any interest. 

When he gets home from work I will ask him how his day was and listen and ask questions as he tells me. It often leads to a bigger conversation of a topic involving him and his interests in some way. I will often wait for him to ask me how my day was and he usually doesn‚Äôt unless I offer the information. Sometimes I will get annoyed by this and go a week without offering to tell him anything, waiting for him to ask, until I forget and go back to offering the information. It feels like he‚Äôs not interested in what I have to say or my interests.

If I bring up the fact that I was talking and ask if he knew what I said he will apologise and obviously can never tell me what I had said, so he clearly was never listening. It‚Äôs hurtful. I will tell him things and then later he will ask a question that he wouldn‚Äôt have had to ask if he had been listening, I‚Äôll point it out and he will have no recollection of me telling him anything.

He hardly knows any of that information about me and I can tell he struggles to listen if I tell him. I can tell he struggles to pay attention when he does ask me questions and I answer. It hurts.

He won‚Äôt ask me back and then I feel like a shitty human for trying to get attention from him. He said he hadn‚Äôt noticed that I was doing this when I told him about it.

Ok, for a bit of context, my family is Mexican, and we live in Coahuila, a state that borders US.

My mom mentioned it and I was dumb enough to comment out loud 'Doesn't that place get hurricanes almost every year?' those where my words. I didn't say it to be pessimistic or a bad cousin, I'm just worried since she lives in a rather dry city and it would be quite a change. I trust she can handle herself, it was just my opinion at the moment. I wouldn't like suddenly getting to know that she's experiencing a hurricane or something.

The thing is, right after I spoke my mom got mildly annoyed saying I'm 'always seeing the worst' and my dad joined in asking 'why can't I just say something pleasant?'. I stayed silent after that but he kept asking why I had to be so pessimistic and to not say it in front of her. Mind you, I usually keep this comments only for my sister,  who is my closest family member, I just made the mistake of saying it out loud for them to hear.

I stayed silent after that but he kept asking why I had to be so pessimistic and to not say it in front of her. Mind you, I usually keep this comments only for my sister,  who is my closest family member, I just made the mistake of saying it out loud for them to hear.

This upset me a bit since I was just voicing out an opinion and concern. Though it could also be that I was tired since they had dragged us (my siblings and I) to a quincea√±era the day before and I didn't get enough rest.

69,1ftetut,AITA for locking up all the kitchen wares because my brother refuses to keep anything clean?,"I'm in my mid 20's and my younger brother (early 20's) is my roommate while I attend college. My mother gave us a deal that as long as we worked and or were in school (I do both) we could live at home to save money. She commutes to and from during the weekend and has a room in another city for the week.

The problem is he is an absolute fucking pig. He refuses to clean anything or take care of his animals. He will leave his cats litterbox full of feces and urine so that I have to clean it up. He doesn't feed any of the 3 animals or give them water. He damages the rental property when he gets angry at the most minute of things, slamming and breaking cabinets, putting holes in the wall, damaging doors you name it. He also refuses to clean the kitchen or really anything that isn't his bathroom. The cleanliness of the house, specifically the kitchen, is so poor that we have a massive roach infestation which has been going on for 6+ months. He leaves dishes and garbage everywhere for weeks to months KNOWING it is only adding to the roach problem and REFUSES to do anything about it until he is 'good and ready.'

I gave up cleaning the kitchen almost a year ago because I don't have the time between work and school to keep his insane level of garbage and dirty dishes at bay. Especially when I have to hand wash everything because he broke the dishwasher in a fit of rage after he lost a video game. I have to eat one meal a day of fast food because the fridge is so dirty from improperly stored cooked and raw food, that I get food poisoning EVERY TIME.

Tonight I got fed up and essentially barred him from using the kitchen. There are no pots or pans, no food in the fridge as it was all cross contaminated, there is no silverware. The kitchen is empty, with all kitchen wares shoved into a box locked in a gun safe. I refuse to live in squalor caused by a roommate that my mother will not kick out, and I refuse to get sick any longer. I also refuse to deal with this diplomatically because he is a narcissist (our father is one and I'm not using it to describe someone vain) and is unable to take responsibility for anything. He would sooner create WW5 in our house and fight, over accepting that an action he took was incorrect.

74,1fte1x4,WIBTA if I asked my mom to have my nephew over less?,"I, 30 F, live with my mother, 61 F. I lived on my own before, until my mother started to have trouble paying her mortgage and needed to pull in a roommate. She wasn't comfortable with non-relatives living with her, so I moved in to help. She gives me a decent rent and I have access to the full house and utilities.

I love my mom, but we have some problems. There were a few ground rules we agreed on when I moved in that she has broken. The one that's becoming a problem is telling me about guests coming over before it happens. I've said time and again to just send me a text if she's having someone over so I can hide in my room. I don't need advanced warning, just give me a five minute heads up. She does not do this. I normally find out there are guests by them greeting me, or by my nephew (7M) showing up behind me to ask what I'm watching/playing.

Here's the thing about me. I do not like kids. Not in the 'all kids are awful, they shouldn't be allowed in public' way, but in the 'I don't know how to talk to them and find any time I'm around them exhausting' type of way. Kids have the right to be around, and I have no issues with my nephew coming over sometimes. I just wish he wasn't here four days a week with no warning. More than than, I wish my mom would supervise him. She's always had a hands off parents style, going to her room and just letting him do this thing. This has resulted in him several times breaking things around the house. She never asks me to watch him, but I feel like the expectation that I will is there.

Also, my nephew loves lego, and loves to play with it directly in front of the door to my room (my room opens directly into the living room), and I've stepped on plenty a lego when I didn't even know he was here. The house is small so there are few other places he can play. I don't get mad at him for it, just asked him to clean up his lego when he's done playing with it. Stepping on a lego today was kind of my breaking point for making this post.

Again, this would all be fine if he came over maybe one or two days a week for a few hours. But that's not the case. He normally comes over every day my mom has off, which is two days a week full day, and then before her late shifts on the weekend for several more hours. To be clear, childcare is not the issues. My dad moved in with my sister, my nephew's mom, to be their full time childcare. My mom just likes having some time with her grandkid. I understand that, I think she deserves time with my nephew. But, I just never agreed to essentially live with a child part time. It's making me regret moving in here.

I, 30 F, live with my mother, 61 F. I lived on my own before, until my mother started to have trouble paying her mortgage and needed to pull in a roommate. She wasn't comfortable with non-relatives living with her, so I moved in to help. She gives me a decent rent and I have access to the full house and utilities.

I love my mom, but we have some problems. There were a few ground rules we agreed on when I moved in that she has broken. The one that's becoming a problem is telling me about guests coming over before it happens. I've said time and again to just send me a text if she's having someone over so I can hide in my room. I don't need advanced warning, just give me a five minute heads up. She does not do this. I normally find out there are guests by them greeting me, or by my nephew (7M) showing up behind me to ask what I'm watching/playing.

75,1ftdzq2,AITA for telling my second cousin I've got a green card?,"I (college age male) grew up outside the USA in what I would describe myself as a privileged existence.

I was about to head off to college. Through sheer luck, a US green card arrived just when I was about to start applying. My parents had applied through the family scheme 20 years ago when I was born, and then the green card finally applied.

I did not know about this but I was profoundly grateful and since I've been in the USA and very happy here.

For some reason which I still do not understand nor has been clearly explained to me, my parents (through whom I got the greencard) have always been very weird about the fact that we have green cards. Perhaps because it is looked upon with great envy in the circles that they move in. For instance, my parents have not told this family that we were close with growing up (went on several trips together). To the extent where they were telling me to lie about my status if anyone asks and say that I just have a student visa. I do not know why this is the case.

I visited some other family acquaintances once, and lied like I was told to and told them I have a student visa. Then I called my Dad up and asked him about it. He said tell them if they ask.

Growing up I got to hang out with my second cousin, and when older we are now in touch semi-regularly. I look up to her and she always gives me amazing advice.

I was talking to her about finding jobs and while talking I mentioned I had a green card when talking about ways to extend the student visa (which I did not have). I did not think of it much when I told her.

Weeks later my mother calls me up and scolds me for telling my second cousing without telling her and my aunts that I told her. Apparently my second cousin called up one of my aunts (with whom she regularly talks to), asked point-blank whether I had a green card, and my aunt was taken by surprise.

I found this so preposterous that I pushed back. I like to consider my second cousin and even my second cousin's mother (my first cousin once removed) close family -- we somewhat grew up together and they at one point lived down the road. Then also, based on this assumption how was I supposed to know that this was some kind of big revelation to make? I was also sending her my resume which clearly states I've got a green card at the top. Then also why does it even matter?

She said that I'm bad at understanding relationships and that I should have known that my second cousin talks to my aunt a lot (this is true, I was aware of the fact, but I don't understand why me telling this family member was a big deal in the firs place).

We fight like cats and dogs, and our communication is really poor, though we do try. I know I‚Äôm not a perfect sister, but I genuinely try to be better. I also know she isn‚Äôt perfect either, but every time I need to communicate with her, I feel like I have to build up this emotional wall because I‚Äôm scared of her reactions. I always feel the need to keep my guard up around her.

I wish we had a closer, more supportive sisterly bond, but she often makes me feel stifled and sheltered. She tells me that we‚Äôre both adults and that I can make my own decisions, yet when I try to do so, she gets upset. For example, if I tell her where I‚Äôm going, she‚Äôll respond with, ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this?‚Äù But if I don‚Äôt tell her, she bombards me with questions about where I‚Äôm going, what I‚Äôm doing, and who I‚Äôm with. I always try to be honest, because I know that‚Äôs the right thing to do, but no matter what I do, it feels like nothing pleases her. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm constantly being treated like a child, even though she says we‚Äôre both adults.

So today, I went to my boyfriend‚Äôs house to charge my devices because Hurricane Helene knocked out our power and water. His family still had both, and his parents were fine with me being there. When my sister called, she asked where I was, and I told her I was at my boyfriend‚Äôs house charging my phone because of the power outage. It was a desperate situation‚Äîno one in my area has power or water, not even our family.

She got furious with me and told me to pack my things because she was taking me to Oklahoma to stay with our parents. For more context, this has been an ongoing issue between us, especially regarding my relationship with my boyfriend. She keeps telling me I need to focus on myself and become more stable‚Äîmentally, emotionally, physically, and financially. While I completely understand and agree that self-growth is important, it‚Äôs hard to do that when she‚Äôs constantly breathing down my neck, telling me what I can and can‚Äôt do.

So, am I the asshole for going to my boyfriend‚Äôs house to charge my phone during an emergency, or is my sister overreacting? And How can I better my relationship with my sister?

79,1ftdkmz,AITA for telling my friend what our other friend has been saying about her boyfriend?,"My(25f) friend ""Maggie""(32f) is my partners bestfriends fianc√©, we hangout a lot bc our partners are close but she is a known gossip. She is friends with ""Katie""(30f) who is a childhood friend of our partners'. Katie and Maggie are much closer to eachother than I am with either of them. Katie got married about 2 years ago despite both her and her husband cheating on each other. I told my bf I don't trust her and I don't want to be around her. Maggie insisted that I become friends with her so, I let my guard down and tried to get to know her. The entire time she has been a flakey friend at best who rarely shows up for you and has a temper tantrum when you legitimately can't make it to one of her events.

So, six months ago Katie and her husband filed for separation and she is currently dating the man ""Josh"" (25m) she was cheating with in her 1.5 year marriage. 

Josh has previously been to prison for stealing cars, he sells drugs and cheats on Katie... or so I've been told by Maggie.

I've made it very clear to Katie that I have no interest in meeting Josh, both my partner and I have big goals for the future and we do not want to be associated with this type of person and for safety resaons we do not want him in our house. However, I didn't disclose these reasons for not wanting to meet him, I would only say ""I don't agree with how you guys met and I don't want to get to know him"" but I made this a clear boundary multiple times. 

Recently I had made plans with Katie for her to come over and as I was preparing everything she messages me saying ""oh Josh is coming btw, I stayed at his place last night"". I stopped responding to her (which may have been immature, but again, I told her multiple times I did not want to meet him). She started blowing up my phone saying ""hello? are we still hanging out"" and trying to guilt trip me saying she's been having a really hard time recently and was really looking forward to hanging out. (This was after she flopped on me 4 times over the previous 2 months). 

The next morning when I was more clear headed I texted her and explained my real reasons for not wanting to be around him and she denied everything. So I responded saying ""Well then you better have a conversation with Maggie, because according to her this is the type of person he is and I don't want to be associated with that"".

I immediately get a phone call from Maggie and she is mad at me explaining that I ""threw her under the bus"", I caused drama in her and Katie's relationship and that she can't trust me anymore and I ruined our friendship.

I understand that Maggie told me these things with the intention of me not telling Katie but at the same time what does she expect me to do with this information? I am obviously not going to be okay being around this guy and in hindsight I could have asked Katie if these things were true, but she still would have questioned where I got the information from and likely denied it so as to not ruin her image.

80,1ftd0ha,AITA for being as high as my friend?,"Almost exactly a year ago today my best friend ended our friendship. We had gone out for his birthday to a park near my house. We had decided to do shrooms together, we had talked about it before and had already done them a couple of times. When we bought them we got a strand we hadn‚Äôt tried before but was supposed to be stronger and better. When I saw him we agreed on a dose and took the same amount, although I did warn him that taking a larger dose could be a lot, and we could take the same dose that we had had with other before (that he had described as a perfect trip) but he wanted to go big for his birthday. About an hour later they started to kick in, a bit different than normal. We talked, listened to music and hung out. After another 30 minutes he said his stomach hurt and he was feeling weird.
I told him that he should puke, although in my inebriated state I may not have said it as nicely as I otherwise would have, and I couldn‚Äôt explain how it would help. He was distressed and we walked up the hill towards the parking lot. At this point the visuals for me were crazy and I was hardly in a place to comfort someone else.

Almost exactly a year ago today my best friend ended our friendship. We had gone out for his birthday to a park near my house. We had decided to do shrooms together, we had talked about it before and had already done them a couple of times. When we bought them we got a strand we hadn‚Äôt tried before but was supposed to be stronger and better. When I saw him we agreed on a dose and took the same amount, although I did warn him that taking a larger dose could be a lot, and we could take the same dose that we had had with other before (that he had described as a perfect trip) but he wanted to go big for his birthday. About an hour later they started to kick in, a bit different than normal. We talked, listened to music and hung out. After another 30 minutes he said his stomach hurt and he was feeling weird.
I told him that he should puke, although in my inebriated state I may not have said it as nicely as I otherwise would have, and I couldn‚Äôt explain how it would help.

My parents + her dog have been at my place during the aftermath of helene + the dog has now ruined my bed. I am requesting she pay for the damages.¬†¬†

The whole story because it‚Äôs even worse than it sounds: My older sister (33F) just had her 1st baby after doing IVF with her bf who has a complicated family. He has several kids + actually left his long-term gf while she was pregnant with their youngest to be with my sister. It is contentious and my sister doesn‚Äôt live with him because he still shares custody of his other kids. So, my sister is effectively solo parenting a majority of the time. Before she had the baby she made arrangements with my parents 60F, 70M to watch her very anxious dog that has extreme separation anxiety. My parents were kind enough to do the same for me a few years ago when I had my 1st baby + my dog was back in my care 8 days PP. It's important to add that they did this for me early on in my mom's terminal cancer diagnosis- she is sadly nearing the end of that journey + has had 6 extended hospital stays since the baby was born and is unable to care for herself.

Again, my sister had her baby 6 WEEKS AGO, but due to some complications had 2 extra hospital stays the first 2 weeks of her PP journey- not what anyone would want. She‚Äôs luckily been home + healthy with baby for over 3 weeks now.
On top of all of this, our area was just devastated by Hurricane Helene. My home as well as my parents + sister's homes have all been w/o power for 4 days. My power was luckily restored yesterday, so l encouraged my parents to bring the dog + themselves to stay with my family + we would cook them dinner, they could sit in the AC + have a comfortable bed to sleep in.
Due to my mom's illness I gave them my room so they would be more comfortable + have better access to a bathroom.

All that to say, I woke up + the dog had an accident in my bed that ruined my $250 mattress pad that I absolutely need. He also had a huge accident in my parents bed that led me to buying them a new sheet set since theirs‚Äôs wasn't salvageable + could also be a biohazard to my very compromised mom.

86,1ftb3ad,AITA for telling my grandmother it's been long enough to grieve?,"I'm a young CTF. My grandmother had my mom at a young age, during her senior year of high school in 1986. I don't really know what life with her was like for my mom, but I know my grandmother was very attached to her only daughter. One of her most bittersweet memories is that as adults, when they used to have nights out together, they'd joke that neither of them was older than 29 and a half if a stranger flirted with them.

My (single) mom died in a car wreck when I was less than 10. For a little kid, that was awful. My life had taken the biggest possible hit I could have gotten at the time, and obviously it wasn't just me that was affected, but of course her one child who never knew life without her was going to be among the most affected. While it deeply affected me in so many ways, I think over the last decade I've risen above most, if not all, of the ways I mistreated others due to unresolved inner pain. More importantly, I've come to make peace with it and move on from her death in such a way that it doesn't affect me anymore.

My grandmother, however, didn't heal nearly as well. She relapsed into addictions, had numerous health issues due to what I'm sure is partly related to internal stress, and most importantly: she still can't talk about my mom without eventually falling apart and crying or making a pity party of herself. Her own childhood was obviously horrible in its own ways - assuming her stories are true - and she suffered from some pretty bad emotional neglect, but she genuinely can't think of her own daughter, whose funeral was almost 10 years ago, without bawling and judging me for not doing the same.

My mom's death clearly had a profound impact on an already emotionally immature person, but am I wrong to say she's taking too long to get over it?
