0,1ftdzin,AITA for simple asking my parents to respect my gender indentity,"I 26 Transfemale MTF, came out when I was 20 years old. I at first was non binary, then shortly after a year I came out as trans female. Unfortunatelyi grew up with Christian African American parents so they aren‚Äôt the most acceptable of the LGBTQ+ community. When I eventually told them my gender identity and asked for them to call me by she/her pronouns, no surprise it was met with none acceptance I didn‚Äôt want to cause confrontation or be kicked out because I have no where to go nor make enough money to take care of myself so I let it go. Fast forward last year I still identify as female have not started HRT but I do have gender affirming clothes that make me feel happy and accepting of myself, I had been having a rough day with transphobic coworkers that I no longer work with, I will say I am a metal head so my way of venting is screaming at the top of my lungs so when I was venting my dad and mom was furious because they couldn‚Äôt hear the TV (reasonably so) it lead to me blowing off steam not just about my co-workers treatment towards me but also how I felt about them and how I felt about hem calling me by my dead name, and not respecting my pronouns. I was emotional and not in my right state of mind, that still doesn‚Äôt excuse my actions. My parents after screaming on me and my dad‚Äôs part calmed down they still refuse to respect my pronouns not call me by my new name because it bothers my given name and according to my dad ‚Äúyou should have at least be with a woman before deciding to fully transitioning‚Äù as if that‚Äôs going to change my mind. I just want my parents to part of my support system I don‚Äôt want to cut ties with them. It sucks that I have to hide my true self from them just to keep the peace and not have the urge to commit murder and remove a few less transphobes in the world.

1,1ftcc03,WIBTA for refusing to go back in the closet to keep my grandma happy? ,"For context, I (20M) am a transgender man. I have been medically transitioning for a year and a half and will be getting top surgery in 3 days. Every person in my life sees me as a man. That is, everyone except my grandmother (84F). 

She is still referring to me using my deadname (which is not even my legal name anymore) and addressing me as a girl or a woman (I already have a deep voice, can grow facial hair and will have had top surgery by the time I see her next). She puts in no effort at all to address me correctly, despite me and my parents (55M and 51F) telling her that I am a man. 

Since I am Indian, we have it in our culture that respecting elders is important and it would be disrespectful to go against them or disagree with them, even if they are wrong. 

I am traveling home after I have had surgery to see my family and have time to relax before I return to college in the winter. During this time, my father wants to bring my grandma home so she can see me. She hasn‚Äôt seen me in person in two years since I wasn‚Äôt in the country, but I would rarely call her due to the fact that she would not address me correctly and any reminder of my transition to her felt like something she couldn‚Äôt accept. I don‚Äôt want to have to feel afraid of her or unsafe in my own home. I also have no say in whether or not I want to be around her. 

I spoke to some friends who are not transgender and they told me that since she is old, she‚Äôll just keep deadnaming me and I should let her because me telling her won‚Äôt change that. But I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fair that her ability to remember it will cost my happiness. She is also not showing any signs of any condition affecting her memory. She still seems to be able to remember everything else but my name.  It‚Äôs been four years. 

I also don‚Äôt think age should be an excuse for not even trying. Plenty of other older people in my life have been very supportive. My other grandma (74F) and an older teacher (62M) have shown me so much support. All I ask for is basic respect and to be treated like a human. 

So WIBTA for not just letting my grandma address me incorrectly and not put in effort? ",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-10-01,"WIBTA for refusing to go back in the closet to keep my grandma happy?
