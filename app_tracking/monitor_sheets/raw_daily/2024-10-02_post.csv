1,1fudbgj,AITA for apologizing too much after accidentally offending someone?,"
I don't know how to make this a normal AITA so I will just tell what happened.

The situation started last Wednesday when a friend of mine, who is trans, mentioned they were having period pains. Not knowing that it was inappropriate to ask, I inquired if they had started transitioning. They told me I shouldn't have asked that, so I apologized.

Later in the week, this friend, along with another person (I'll call them Silvie and Avi), started acting strangely around me. By Monday, they both approached me, asking for space because of my question and because I often say ""out of pocket"" things. I was confused, as I thought we had a good relationship, so I sent them both a message trying to explain myself. In my message, I told them that I'm an introverted, autistic person who sometimes says things without realizing they're inappropriate. I explained that I open up to people I feel comfortable with, and I wasn't trying to be offensive. I also shared that I don't have many friends, and I'm scared of losing the ones I do have. 

After sending this, Avi responded angrily, accusing me of guilt-tripping. They told me to stop messaging them and blocked me. I didn't understand what I'd done to make them so upset. I sent more messages to Silvie, trying to figure out where things went wrong, but they told me I was crossing personal boundaries by continuing to ask for explanations. Silvie explained that asking for space means giving space, and that I shouldn't be sending multiple messages trying to justify my actions or push for answers. Silvie also pointed out that we've only known each other for a short time, and just because I feel comfortable with them, it doesnâ€™t mean they owe me anything.

In response, I apologized again and said I would leave them alone until they felt ready to talk. I explained that I was just trying to fix things because I value their friendship. However, after talking to a Discord friend, I realized that my final messages might have made things worse, so I deleted them and sent a simpler apology.

When I discussed the situation with my mom and sister, they had different views. My mom said I should ignore them because Silvieâ€™s reaction showed they weren't good people if they got upset so easily. My sister and her boyfriend agreed, saying I shouldn't have apologized because I didnâ€™t know it was wrong to ask about transitioning. They felt that Silvie and Avi were overreacting, and I should distance myself from them. They also suggested I avoid the cinema club that Avi and Silvie attend.

To make up for missing out on the movie they watched at the cinema club, my family and I watched the same movie at home.

Now, I'm left wondering: was I the asshole in this situation? Were Silvie and Avi justified in their reaction, or was my family right in thinking they overreacted?
