1,1fudbgj,AITA for apologizing too much after accidentally offending someone?,"
I don't know how to make this a normal AITA so I will just tell what happened.

The situation started last Wednesday when a friend of mine, who is trans, mentioned they were having period pains. Not knowing that it was inappropriate to ask, I inquired if they had started transitioning. They told me I shouldn't have asked that, so I apologized.

Later in the week, this friend, along with another person (I'll call them Silvie and Avi), started acting strangely around me. By Monday, they both approached me, asking for space because of my question and because I often say ""out of pocket"" things. I was confused, as I thought we had a good relationship, so I sent them both a message trying to explain myself. In my message, I told them that I'm an introverted, autistic person who sometimes says things without realizing they're inappropriate. I explained that I open up to people I feel comfortable with, and I wasn't trying to be offensive. I also shared that I don't have many friends, and I'm scared of losing the ones I do have. 

After sending this, Avi responded angrily, accusing me of guilt-tripping. They told me to stop messaging them and blocked me. I didn't understand what I'd done to make them so upset. I sent more messages to Silvie, trying to figure out where things went wrong, but they told me I was crossing personal boundaries by continuing to ask for explanations. Silvie explained that asking for space means giving space, and that I shouldn't be sending multiple messages trying to justify my actions or push for answers. Silvie also pointed out that we've only known each other for a short time, and just because I feel comfortable with them, it doesn‚Äôt mean they owe me anything.

In response, I apologized again and said I would leave them alone until they felt ready to talk. I explained that I was just trying to fix things because I value their friendship. However, after talking to a Discord friend, I realized that my final messages might have made things worse, so I deleted them and sent a simpler apology.

When I discussed the situation with my mom and sister, they had different views. My mom said I should ignore them because Silvie‚Äôs reaction showed they weren't good people if they got upset so easily. My sister and her boyfriend agreed, saying I shouldn't have apologized because I didn‚Äôt know it was wrong to ask about transitioning. They felt that Silvie and Avi were overreacting, and I should distance myself from them. They also suggested I avoid the cinema club that Avi and Silvie attend.

To make up for missing out on the movie they watched at the cinema club, my family and I watched the same movie at home.

Now, I'm left wondering: was I the asshole in this situation? Were Silvie and Avi justified in their reaction, or was my family right in thinking they overreacted?

2,1furzzy,AITA for refusing to cook a vegetarian Thanksgiving dinner?,"I feel like I‚Äôve slipped into the twilight zone with this whole argument, so tell me what‚Äôs up, internet folks.

Background: I (31F) and my brother Mark (35M) do not get along. When he was a teen he saw a documentary on factory farming and decided to become a vegetarian. He got very, very annoying about it quickly, but my dad shut him down when he started trying to get the rest of us to be vegetarian with him.  Then he went to college, made a bunch of very strange friends, and went militantly vegan. It‚Äôs his entire personality. I stopped talking to him after he threw a fit about one of my birthday dinners being at a steakhouse and spammed my messages and SM with pictures of abused cows.

My parents have been trying to repair the situation and for a while, it did seem like Mark was getting better so I‚Äôve been letting him back into contact gradually. Then he started dating Pam, who is some kind of vegan influencer. She is apparently moderately popular online, but I have no idea what she does exactly. I don‚Äôt know if Mark was trying to impress her or what, but last Thanksgiving he insisted that mom cook at least a vegetarian meal or they wouldn‚Äôt come on ‚Äúethical grounds‚Äù. My mom just wanted everyone to get along on her favorite holiday, so she agreed. It was not a fun meal.

This year, my parents have downsized for retirement and my mom is having health problems. I bought their house when they moved, so my mom asked me to host Thanksgiving so it would be like usual. I told everyone in the group chat so Mark and Pam could make travel arrangements and Pam immediately started gushing about all the vegan replacement recipes she could give me to replace the traditional ones.  I said to send me a main dish recipe they like and I would give it a shot, but I‚Äôm making the traditional meal otherwise and there should still be plenty of things they can eat.  Mark and Pam have been arguing about this with me for days and then Mark said that if I wouldn‚Äôt make a meat-free meal they wouldn‚Äôt come.  This upset my mom, who asked me to just make what she made last year to keep the peace, but I told her that Mark needs to get over himself and I‚Äôm not coddling him.  I‚Äôm having turkey on Thanksgiving.

My dad privately agrees with me, but Mark threatening to not come is upsetting my mom so much that he‚Äôs worried it will impact her health. There‚Äôs a not big, but also not zero chance that these might be some of the last family holidays we have with her. My mom thinks I‚Äôm putting turkey over my own family and I‚Äôm not so sure anymore.

4,1fuom8p,AITA for Telling My Parents Their Noisy Chewing and Coughing Will Make Me Deaf by 30?,"Okay so this might be pretty weird but please bear with me I'm stuck and I have no idea what to do. Since I was young, I have always hated some sort of sounds (chewing, smacking of the lips in a specific way, loud breathing, huffing, throat clearing, slamming cabinets...etc). At first I just hated those sounds, but with age my reaction to those sounds became horrifying. Each time I hear one of those sounds I would get extremely stressed and panicked to the point where I just slam my hands against my ears to block them out (sometimes I'd get headaches because of how hard I slammed my ears). With time I stopped physically blocking my ears each time I hear one of those sounds and just started to listen to music each time I hear my father eating or my mother breathing loudly. This is extremely unlivable because I also have a problem with daydreaming (I spend an average of 6 hours per day daydreaming and my main trigger for the daydreams is loud music). So, I am sort of stuck now because I want to be able to quit daydreaming, but I can't exactly do that because I have to keep on listening to music to block those sounds.

To clarify one thing, I can't just put on my headphones whenever I know someone is chewing loudly because the coughing happens randomly and very frequently which means whenever I don't have my headphones on, I‚Äôm anxious and extremely stressed. It‚Äôs unbearable.

Now to explain better what I meant by the title; my father mocks me for feeling this way and thinks I am doing this to make fun of him (bear in mind I am 22 years old). He thinks my reactions to those sounds are made up even though I keep telling him I have no reason to be making any of this up. It's just that I can't control my physical reaction to chewing sounds. I tried making this clear but it never works.

Today I came home for some peace but everything was happening at once, my father kept coughing, my mother was huffing and my little brother was kicking cabinet doors while yelling about something. I was so overwhelmed that I snapped and accused my parents of planning to make me deaf by 30. They thought it was unfair for me to blame them for a disability and that they wouldn't change themselves because I don't like some sounds.

I don't want to be unfair to anybody especially my parents. I feel really bad about how I am no longer hanging out with them because I am always on edge and anxious around them. So I just want to know whether it is too much to ask them to be less noisy. Each time I come home, it's just constant noise and not one second for me to feel safe without my headphones.

AITA for thinking that they should work on stopping making triggering sounds because I am bursting my eardrums trying to tune them out and I‚Äôm afraid of going deaf? (I also can't work on my daydreaming addiction because my main trigger is listening to music)

In general, my wife and I have demanding careers but we have taken jobs that provide schedule flexibility over big checks because we believe family should be above everything else.  That said, we also really LOVE when our parents visit, especially for the kids. I grew up with no grandparents (they died young) and I know how much I would have loved to have them around.  She grew up with very present and available grandparents, which she loved and wants for our children.

They are either a 12 hour drive or 1.5 hour flight. On my side, my mother is retired. On hers, her mother works an extremely flexible job where she actually flies into our town about once a quarter. Her father is retired. They are all between 60-65 years of age. 

Here is what happens when they visit. 

1) They stay at a hotel when we have openly invited them to stay with us. Our home is quite large and we have a finished basement with a full bath available as well as a guest room upstairs.

6,1fuod6i,AITA for not cleaning up my roommates‚Äô messes?,"
I (19F) live with 3 other girls: a grad student who‚Äôs rarely home due to work and the other two my age. Since we moved in this past August, the two who I‚Äôll call Ella and Sara, have been really bad at cleaning up after themselves. They‚Äôre best friends and cook together every day, but rarely throw stuff away or put dirty dishes/pans in the sink, and when they do they just let it pile up for days. 

Our other roommate, Casey, used to wash their dishes when she got home in the evenings but eventually started washing only her own. I rarely have dishes to clean besides a few cups and utensils because the kitchen is always so gross that I don‚Äôt have space/an appetite to cook (I‚Äôm talking eggshells on the counter, a melted stick of butter, crusty pans, mystery spills, shoes on the counter, empty alcohol bottles, fast food boxes, etc). I live off of snacks in my room most days. The few times I have made food, I washed my pots once I was done eating. As for the dishes in the sink, they‚Äôre usually buried under everyone else‚Äôs dishes so it‚Äôs hard to even get to them. I sometimes try to put things in the dishwasher but it‚Äôs such a hassle because they leave hardened food on everything which takes forever to scrape off. The mess also extends into the common room.

I‚Äôve stayed silent so far, except the one time I gave in and washed every single crusty dish (It took over an hour). They were getting a bit better at cleaning lately, but on Monday I heard Sara and Ella yelling about how me and Casey don‚Äôt wash the dishes or take out the trash. They knew I was home too and were very obvious about it.

They were blaming us for the entire mess. This went on throughout the whole day. I was in my room all day working on an important essay, but I overheard a lot because they were practically yelling. At one point they called us ‚Äúdumb fucks‚Äù and wondered if we were ‚Äúsecretly autistic and didn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù I texted Casey to tell her what was going on and she agreed that they‚Äôre the only ones who cook regularly since the kitchen is too disgusting for anyone else to use. We agreed that all 4 of us need to talk.

Later, Sara and Ella cleaned the whole kitchen (except for me and Casey‚Äôs dishes) and complained the entire time. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that they‚Äôre blaming this perpetual mess on us instead of having a conversation like adults or just cleaning. I had to blast music in my AirPods all day to drown them out so I could finish my essay. At no point did they make an effort to approach me.

Before this, they admitted that they need to be more considerate and do a better job of cleaning but now they‚Äôre switching up out of nowhere. I‚Äôve had my fair share of roommate drama last school year and can‚Äôt deal with any more so I‚Äôm just letting them throw a fit until they‚Äôre ready to have a real conversation.

At one point they called us ‚Äúdumb fucks‚Äù and wondered if we were ‚Äúsecretly autistic and didn‚Äôt know it.‚Äù I texted Casey to tell her what was going on and she agreed that they‚Äôre the only ones who cook regularly since the kitchen is too disgusting for anyone else to use. We agreed that all 4 of us need to talk.

Later, Sara and Ella cleaned the whole kitchen (except for me and Casey‚Äôs dishes) and complained the entire time. I think it‚Äôs ridiculous that they‚Äôre blaming this perpetual mess on us instead of having a conversation like adults or just cleaning. I had to blast music in my AirPods all day to drown them out so I could finish my essay. At no point did they make an effort to approach me.

Before this, they admitted that they need to be more considerate and do a better job of cleaning but now they‚Äôre switching up out of nowhere. I‚Äôve had my fair share of roommate drama last school year and can‚Äôt deal with any more so I‚Äôm just letting them throw a fit until they‚Äôre ready to have a real conversation.

I‚Äôm a huge fan of Max Strus. I think he‚Äôs super underrated, especially with his three-point shooting and how hard he plays on defense. I was excited to see what he‚Äôd do this season, but then my friend completely shuts me down and says, ‚ÄúBro, Max Strus is an ass player. He‚Äôs trash.‚Äù

At first, I thought he was joking, but he kept going, saying Strus was overrated and only got playing time because the Heat were desperate. He called him a ""low-tier role player"" and said I was wasting my time hyping him up. I got really defensive, because Strus has worked hard to get where he is, and I felt like my friend was being unfair. I told him he doesn‚Äôt understand basketball if he can‚Äôt appreciate a player like Strus who hustles and contributes in ways that don‚Äôt always show up on the stat sheet.

16,1fun2jv,AITA for calling out my friends for being disrespectful? ,"I‚Äôm (18F) a freshman at college. I believe I already found my true friends here. We used to get along so well until (fake name) Jack started hanging out with us.

I don‚Äôt like him and I promise I have REALLY tried.

Unfortunately everyone else in the group likes him, and they accepted him pretty quickly. So even though I don‚Äôt feel close to him, and don‚Äôt actually consider him to be a part of our group he now hangs out with us pretty much all the time.

Then he started bringing his own friend. No hate to him, he‚Äôs a total sweetheart. But he‚Äôs severely deaf and almost never speaks, so it‚Äôs really hard to make a bond with him. None of us know sign language except Jack (he has a deaf mom so he learned as a kid)

Sometimes they talk and make jokes between each other when we are all hanging out and it feels really rude. Lately they been doing this a lot more often so I decided to call them out on it. First I texted everyone in the group how I really feel about the situation (that I don‚Äôt blame Barron but I think Jack should have known better and it feels like he‚Äôs doing it on purpose).

Then I texted Jack , basically saying I think what they do is disrespectful. I texted Barron separately. I told him feel a little left out when they do that. I also told him I think he doesn‚Äôt need to rely on Jack, we can text instead, or find other ways , and I would like to hang out more on our own if he‚Äôs interested. 

(He can lip-read so Jack was only helping him when he‚Äôs left behind and mostly just voicing for him.)

I really thought I handled this pretty well but Jack thought I was being rude to them and especially to him. One of the girls sided with him and the rest say they ‚Äúget both sides‚Äù, yet still all of them think I owe an apology to the guys.

On top of that Barron totally misunderstood my intentions, which was embarrassing AF. I told him I didn‚Äôt mean it like that and he said ‚ÄúLMFO sorry my bad, I guess you were just being ableist in a weird fucking way.‚Äù

I told him I wasn‚Äôt being ableist either and tried to clarify myself, but he ghosted me. I haven‚Äôt talked with Jack since then either. It‚Äôs been two days.

I responded by saying its a vape (which I mean isn't a lie). Now my mom does know I smoke but still, out of respect for them I don't smoke infront of my parents.

I came home today after a days work and find my dad in the living room waiting for me. He starts tearing into me about being irresponsible and how could I keep ''weed'' in his house. For clarity sake there are two things.
1.My mother knows because she found my buds one day but didn't tell my dad as to avoid drama, meaning he didn't know.
2. My room isn't in the house as I'm liveing in an outside room attached to the house

Upon talking to my sister I found out my mom went to my room to see if I had any nasal spray as my sister's nose was blocked, she saw the vape again and wanted to taste it (as she normally tries my new vapes to see what they taste like). After she went back in the house she told my sister about how funny my new vape tasted and how she couched after trying it.

My sister also has abit of experience with edibles and after abit noticed mt mom acting weird. She walked in on her stareing at the clock on the wall. My sister pieced it together and realized what was going on, giveing her water and keeping her company while she was high. 

From what my sister told me she wasn't scared or anything like that but more intrigued by everything going on.

I should also add marijuana is decrimanalized here meaning you can use it just not sell it.

20,1fukey8,WIBTA for insisting my MIL obtain training for her Jack Russell terrier? ,"My MIL has recently moved in with us from out of state, along with her JRT. I am unsure of precisely how old it is, and I don't want to ask her right now because I am confident my tone will reflect my exasperation with the situation. She has probably had him 3-5 years, and my husband speculated maybe he was in an abusive situation beforehand. 

This dog. She is currently managing his barking outbursts with a vibrating collar with mixed success. She did have him medicated to relieve stress for their move across the country, and of course some misbehaviors with that stressor was to be expected. 

However, his normal state of being (how he was even before moving) is apparently to display very aggressive behaviors (barking, running, growling) if anyone moves in the vicinity of him or her when they are together. She has been restricting him to her room and only bringing him out to relieve himself in the backyard/hang out for a time back there. Yesterday when I went to ask her something, he ran up to me growling and snarling when I opened the door. 

She purchased a muzzle for him that she plans to use when allowing him outside her room, because my husband has another mixed breed dog who mirrors other dogs' behaviors toward them, so we've been keeping them separated. 

We have 3 kids, one of whom is a crawling infant, so if there are different things that should be occurring for better outcomes I'd like to look into them because she seems to just offer various excuses (he growls because he's scared, because he's attached, etc. etc.) and bandaid fixes (separations, muzzles) instead of resolving the issues that, bluntly, seem to be caused by irresponsible pet ownership. 

For example, I know nothing about JRTs but in my cursory Google search before coming here I read that they are a breed that REQUIRES walks. She has been here almost a week, and he's not gone on a single walk. She is disabled so while she's able to go run errands and everything, I'm unsure of walking the dog is something she's ever done.

22,1fujl7w,AITA for telling my mother she is taking 4 grand from me because of petty feelings?,"Me 18m mother 41f father 40m. Two weeks ago I was in a car accident where my truck was totaled. My father and mother don‚Äôt get along the best so when my mom found out that my dad was helping with insurance she decided it was her job to do it. She took over right before we knew how much the insurance was going to pay us for the truck. I already found that super weird because there was not much left to do but I left it at that. Soon after my mother texted me saying how they were going to be paying 5 thousand for the truck a 2008 Chevy Silverado. I did some research and found these truck in mint condition usually go for around 7-8 thousand. So I was even more skeptical and asked my father to get the insurance to email him the confirmation on how much they paid out the truck for. That is when I found out that they were paying 7,4 thousand for the truck. But my mother was saying that I would get 3 thousand after she paid off the rest of the truck. After this I confronted her and she confirmed she was going to take the money. She said it was because I was being rude to her and I don‚Äôt treat her with respect. Her definition of rude is walking away mad after she calls the way I dress gay and always putting me down. I told her she is going to take 4 thousand dollars from her son and possibly ruin our relationship more for petty feelings and she got really angry saying that I never respect her and I am always rude. Am I the asshole I‚Äôm really confused by this situation.

EDIT: lots of people are asking who pays what. I would help pay the loan and insurance whenever I had money available. The title is in both of our names. And to clear up the money stuff she says that she owes 1,5k left in the truck.

And thank you for all the support!!!",Not enough info,2024-10-02,"AITA for telling my mother she is taking 4 grand from me because of petty feelings? Me 18m mother 41f father 40m. Two weeks ago I was in a car accident where my truck was totaled. My father and mother don‚Äôt get along the best so when my mom found out that my dad was helping with insurance she decided it was her job to do it. She took over right before we knew how much the insurance was going to pay us for the truck. I already found that super weird because there was not much left to do but I left it at that. Soon after my mother texted me saying how they were going to be paying 5 thousand for the truck a 2008 Chevy Silverado. I did some research and found these truck in mint condition usually go for around 7-8 thousand. So I was even more skeptical and asked my father to get the insurance to email him the confirmation on how much they paid out the truck for. That is when I found out that they were paying 7,4 thousand for the truck. But my mother was saying that I would get 3 thousand after she paid off the rest of the truck. After this I confronted her and she confirmed she was going to take the money. She said it was because I was being rude to her and I don‚Äôt treat her with respect. Her definition of rude is walking away mad after she calls the way I dress gay and always putting me down. I told her she is going to take 4 thousand dollars from her son and possibly ruin our relationship more for petty feelings and she got really angry saying that I never respect her and I am always rude. Am I the asshole I‚Äôm really confused by this situation.

EDIT: lots of people are asking who pays what. I would help pay the loan and insurance whenever I had money available. The title is in both of our names. And to clear up the money stuff she says that she owes 1,5k left in the truck. She was going to give me 3k without telling me that they were giving 7k for it so she would give me 6k roughly but she was tying to only give me three. I have a text of her knowing about it and telling me she was never going to tell me me I hope this clears things up. And thank you for all the support!!!",3.0,-0.0021344556007534266,0,0
23,1fujfy4,AITA for going away with my parents without asking/telling my sisters first but,"
TLDR; invited parents to join my wife and I on a holiday, second we have gone on in 2 years. ent on second holiday in 2 years with parents. Sisters are angry at me for not asking them first as it takes parental support from them plus clashes with the birthday of one sister. I am hurt and see it as my sister's egocentric lens of viewing the world. 

I have two sisters, Jess and Lucy. We all have kids. One of Jess', Tom, is tricky. I've always worked hard on rship with him. Parents help us all with babysitting etc.

My wife and I invited parents to join us on an international vacation we had booked. It was a country destination parents/my fam went to 2 years ago. Parents agreed. As context, last year parents declined a similar invite from Jess as not interested in destination (clearly not their thing)/Jess' kids are difficult/parents feel being used as babysitters. 

My parents accidentally let slip Jess was angry at me for inviting parents away with my fam again. I raised this with Jess and we had a heated conversation. Her main issues was that I should have told her before asking my parents, particularly as I had already been away to the same place. She was pretty harsh and I unfortunately retorted she was jealous, she responded that I can be so nasty etc. The impact on her is that third day away is her birthday (in the past she has suggested birthdays are not important to her) and also parents won't be around for you weeks. During the convo I was defensive and she kept saying ""I'm just telling you how I feel"". A few days later Jess sent a text apologising/said she loved me and I apologised back. 

Bit later we went away for a few day for a few family bdays. At one point Tom became agitated there was no a cake for him (birthday was 5 months later). He was quite aggressive towards my mum. At dinner with adults I said Tom reminded me of me, that he seemed to want an argument. Jess was upset, I clarified I thought it was for stimulation/anxiety and consistent with ADHD (I'm a child psych). I left the room due to conflict. 2 days later, I sent an apology noting it wasn't crticism and explaining what I mean meant - not to justify but so that she didn't think I had a bad opinion of Tom. Jess said no hard feelings but was abrupt. Haven't spoken since.

Now on and discovered Jess is still angry, told parents she didn't want to speak to me on her bday. I sent a video of my kids/wife/me singing happy bday.  Lucy is apparently angry that parents can't help during school holidays.

Basically Jess and Lucy think I'm selfish/thoughtless for not checking. I didn't think of it tbh and still don't see it is my responsibility. My wife/kids/me were already booked and just inviting parents. I think it's my parents job to clarify with Jess/Lucy that they can manage ok.  I'm now hurt I got no benefit of the doubt when we've been close and I've tried.to helped where I can. I have no interest in speaking to Jess or Lucy tm. Its also basically ruining the vacation.

So AITA?  Or is this a little harsh of my sisters?

Please don‚Äôt leave comments in regards to us being married so young is a mistake, as that is irrelevant to my question but I constantly get comments about it on here. 

My husband and I have our own apartment together, and we have come to realize it is fairly expensive to live on our own where we live and were considering the possibility of a roommate when our lease runs out. My best friend has had a rather rough living situation and has moved in with her older sister. Her older sister wants to buy a house next year so Sally will be needing to find somewhere else to go. I previously suggested that Sally, my husband, and I all get a place together. When I suggested this, she had plans to go to cosmetology school and get a driver‚Äôs license, with her sister‚Äôs help. 

The issue is, she no longer cares about getting a license or has any interest in a future career. She works a warehouse job making a couple dollars over minimum wage, which doesn‚Äôt go very far where we live. She also claims her anxiety is too much for driving so she won‚Äôt even go get her driver‚Äôs permit and try to learn. She says that she doesn‚Äôt need one because she wants to move to Europe and hates America, and she doesn‚Äôt care about a future career because she needs to focus on right now. 

I am concerned that she is going to want to stay with us long term (5+ years) and not make any effort to move on her own when the time comes. I am also worried she is regularly going to ask me to buy her groceries and ask for rides and I don‚Äôt have the means to care for another person financially. She already asks her sister for money often and asks me for rides and doesn‚Äôt help with gas money. 

The reason I view a license as important is that she spends $80+ ubering every day, and with the cost of living here I fear she would miss her portion of the rent spending that kind of money on uber. I told her I could get her into paid EMT classes with me and could ride with me to work, but the moment she found out she would have to remove her piercings she immediately lost interest.

edit: I likely won‚Äôt respond to every single comment just because there‚Äôs a lot, and they all essentially say the same thing. Here‚Äôs some answers to some repeat questions I‚Äôve seen:

She has zero plans for how she plans to move to Europe, except that she has an online friend in Finland and seems interested in that country. I don‚Äôt think she has researched immigration. 

The reason I view a license as important: Public transportation where we live isn‚Äôt great and reliable transportation to a job is important. It also was concerning to me that she was originally interested in a license but has completely dropped the ball. 

As for why she can‚Äôt go to her sister‚Äôs new house: I don‚Äôt know. Her older brother also does not have a license and lives with her sister. Sister is 24, brother is 30. I am not sure what his living situation will be after sister gets a house.

26,1fuichb,AITA for refusing to go to my friend's birthday party? ,"I (18F) have been friends with a girl called Mary (19F) since we were both in middle school. Throughout high school, she was my closest friend, but ever since we started college a year ago we havent kept in touch much and are not very close anymore. 

Two weeks ago, she turned 19, and she has been planning on throwing a big party to celebrate her birthday. The party would be next Saturday (in 3 days). When she first told me about the party I said I would come with no hesitation because I want to celebrate her birthday with her and it would be a great way to reconnect. 

However, two days ago she created a discussion group to give us information about the party and that made me rethink my choice. The first thing I noticed is the number of people in that group (53 people, I counted them). Then, in the discussion she started telling people to bring as much alcohol as they could. I don't normally drink, and if I do it's like one glass of wine. I don't like parties where people drink a lot and end up completely drunk, because it can be very dangerous and is also not something I find fun. I only go to a party where there is alcohol when I know and trust all of the people there, because you never know what people can do under the influence. A lot of the people invited are people that I don't know, there are only 4 of my friends, and only 2 plan on going.

I messaged her and told her that I wasn't so sure I would be coming and explained why to her. She told me that if I didn't want to drink that was fine, and she wouldn't force me to and I could still have a great time. I told her that I would see and left it at that. I talked about it with another friend, Lily (19F), who was also invited, and she told me that she wasn't going because the last time she went to a party with Mary she sort of made her drink even though she promised not to. She didn't directly force her but kept telling her that she was no fun and should've stayed home and that she wouldn't do things with her again, so Lily drank a bit to make her happy. Lily also told me that, last time, a guy was so drunk that he fell out of a window (second floor so luckily he wasn't injured). 

After learning all that, I decided not to go because I thought Mary would do the same thing to me, and I really didn't want to drink. I also didn't feel safe or comfortable considering what had happened in the past. I told Mary all of that and she basically snapped at me, saying that I was an AH for cancelling 3 days before the party, and that I was making it sound like she forced people to drink. She was (and still is) very mad at me. I feel bad because it's her birthday and I haven't seen her in a long time. Maybe I'm really being a bore and it's not that big of a deal. I don't know. AITA?

28,1fuhzo8,AITA for kicking my sister out of my house over a garden?,"My sister has lived with me since she was a teen mom. She has her own little space for her and her kids. It‚Äôs my house. I own it. 

My fiancee Amy moved in and as my wife Amy can remodel the home as she likes. Amy and I have been together for 4 years. My sister has lived with me for 6. 

My sister and Amy got in this huge argument over ripping out my grass where her kids play and making a garden that will bloom next spring. Amy had discussed this with me and it was agreed on. Because of our different schedules we forgot about my sister and telling her about the garden. Amy took a few days off from work to meet with the contractors for the initial digging up the yard. This happened while I was at work.

My sister made a scene with the contractors and yelled at Amy. Amy told my sister that it‚Äôs time for her to move out and get on with her own life. I have been supporting her and her kids for too long. 

A neighbor got involved and called the police saying Amy wasn‚Äôt authorized to have the contractors dig up the yard.

Amy was asked to leave the property by the police with an overnight bag. This was a supervised by the police because I was not reachable at work. My sister told me ‚Äúcan you believe this bitch ripping up the yard like that‚Äù 

I have to leave work and take my hour commute home to deal with my sister. I told her it‚Äôs time for her to move out and she should have never been involved with the garden. It wasn‚Äôt her place. It‚Äôs not her fucking home. 

My sister was complaining that her boys love to play in that patch of grass and she can‚Äôt believe I would make changes to her play area without consulting her. 

Amy is fucking pissed at my sister and the neighbor. The neighbor tried to apologize but I had to tell the neighbor there is no more coming over because she will be trespassed and she had no business calling the police and making the situation worse.  The neighbor explained she didn‚Äôt know Amy was authorized to make those changes and I told the neighbor too fucking bad. She‚Äôs banned from the property even though she‚Äôs friends with my sister and their kids play together. 

I told my sister that her and the boys have to go and she needs to be out by the New Year or will take legal action on her. 

My sister keeps crying and apologizing but her actions showed Amy what her married life would be like with my sister lived with us and I‚Äôm putting my wife first and my sister has to go. 

Edit: Amy and I talk to a lawyer and we are getting the legal paperwork together for my sister's eviction. The lawyer also suggested cameras for the yard and those will be installed next week. I'm sending my sister legal notice of the cameras being installed to cover my ass per the lawyer's request. 

I do not blame the police for their reaction and neither does Amy. 

Our destanation wedding is upcoming in a few weeks. My sister was not going because of her relationship with our parents.

My sister has lived with me since she was a teen mom. She has her own little space for her and her kids. It‚Äôs my house. I own it. 

My fiancee Amy moved in and as my wife Amy can remodel the home as she likes. Amy and I have been together for 4 years. My sister has lived with me for 6. 

My sister and Amy got in this huge argument over ripping out my grass where her kids play and making a garden that will bloom next spring. Amy had discussed this with me and it was agreed on. Because of our different schedules we forgot about my sister and telling her about the garden. Amy took a few days off from work to meet with the contractors for the initial digging up the yard. This happened while I was at work.

My sister made a scene with the contractors and yelled at Amy. Amy told my sister that it‚Äôs time for her to move out and get on with her own life. I have been supporting her and her kids for too long. 

A neighbor got involved and called the police saying Amy wasn‚Äôt authorized to have the contractors dig up the yard.

Amy was asked to leave the property by the police with an overnight bag. This was a supervised by the police because I was not reachable at work. My sister told me ‚Äúcan you believe this bitch ripping up the yard like that‚Äù 

I have to leave work and take my hour commute home to deal with my sister. I told her it‚Äôs time for her to move out and she should have never been involved with the garden. It wasn‚Äôt her place. It‚Äôs not her fucking home. 

My sister was complaining that her boys love to play in that patch of grass and she can‚Äôt believe I would make changes to her play area without consulting her. 

Amy is fucking pissed at my sister and the neighbor. The neighbor tried to apologize but I had to tell the neighbor there is no more coming over because she will be trespassed and she had no business calling the police and making the situation worse.  The neighbor explained she didn‚Äôt know Amy was authorized to make those changes and I told the neighbor too fucking bad. She‚Äôs banned from the property even though she‚Äôs friends with my sister and their kids play together. 

I told my sister that her and the boys have to go and she needs to be out by the New Year or will take legal action on her. 

My sister keeps crying and apologizing but her actions showed Amy what her married life would be like with my sister lived with us and I‚Äôm putting my wife first and my sister has to go. 

Edit: Amy and I talk to a lawyer and we are getting the legal paperwork together for my sister's eviction. The lawyer also suggested cameras for the yard and those will be installed next week. I'm sending my sister legal notice of the cameras being installed to cover my ass per the lawyer's request. 

I do not blame the police for their reaction and neither does Amy. 

Our destanation wedding is upcoming in a few weeks. My sister was not going because of her relationship with our parents. But the cameras will be installed by then with the legal notice my sister is not to tamper with the cameras or make any cosmetic changes to the property while we are out of town.

29,1fuhspi,AITA for telling my current stepdad he doesn't have a special role in my wedding?,"My current stepdad has been in my (27f) life since I was 10. This is when my mom married him. I never knew my bio father. But the man I call my dad was my first stepdad technically. He actually adopted me when I was 5. We met when I was only 6 months old and he died when I was 8. And to me he has always been my dad. Not the bio who didn't want to raise me and not my current stepdad.

This was always a point of contention with my current stepdad. He wanted me to accept him as the new dad in my life and the fact dad wasn't my bio dad was the biggest reason why he felt like it should be no big deal. But I was protective of dad's memory and the fact that blood wasn't what made him my dad. So I never liked how my stepdad acted about it. My mom tried to help but she made it worse. She acted like dad could be replaced because he died and really made me question whether she truly loved him or whether she saw people as only important while they were alive and once they're gone welp, move onto the next one. I know spouses and parents are different. But my mom spoke like you just discard the dead.

There was a lot of him chasing a relationship with me that was dad and daughter and him getting mad that I was still bringing up my dad and then I didn't want him to even talk to me. I didn't want to build up a relationship with him and resented the pressure from both to just accept the new dad. It was a very messy time.

My relationship with them now is more civil. But I don't have too much respect for them and still dislike they handled him coming into my life and the relationship they wanted me to have with him as well as the disregard for my dad.

This all boils over now because I'm getting married and I chose, for my own peace of mind, to not have the normal walk down the aisle or father/daughter dance. He was expecting to be offered those things to be asked to fill in as Father of the Bride. And he approached me about it which is when I told him I wasn't doing either at my wedding. He then started ranting about what his special role is supposed to be then and I said he didn't have a special role and that neither he or my mom had one. He said my dad gets one. That dad gets a whole ass seat for his photo even though he's dead and that I can't even give him (stepdad) a spot in my wedding after 17 years. Then he asked if it was about money and whether I wanted him to pay for the wedding. I said no. I want my wedding to be my way. He told me he deserves better.

I was taking an afternoon walk a couple days ago and came past these kids all under the age of 12 (youngest looked about 7; possibly all siblings) on the busy suburban road. They were crossing from one side of the road to the other side with busy incoming traffic on both ways and during that time is peak hour. A couple cars had beeped at them but no one seemed stopped. Their parents were no where to be seen. It annoyed me a lot since it could cause a big accident and injury. I thought about not speaking up but something in me was like no say something. 

I will admit I spoke out in emotion because I said ‚ÄúYou do know what you‚Äôre doing is fucking dangerous‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere the fuck are your parents?‚Äù And the kid responded ‚ÄúInside‚Äù I told them ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs best you guys go back inside because if you guys keep on doing this you will cause an accident‚Äù 

I felt so bad to swear at kids I did not know. I was so frustrated that no one had stopped to tell these kids to stop running back and forth off the road. Their parents obviously did not care what their children were up to because if they did they would be outside watching them. 

But AITAH for swearing at them? I definitely do know there could have a been a better way to approach it. The intention was there just the way I spoke out wasn‚Äôt.

It's punishing them for bad behavior.

I dont get along with my SIL. She does not like me. I have tried to talk this out but she is not interested. As a result I am very careful when we see each other and do not say too much. She is very strong verbally and she walks all over me. My husband, or anyone else in the family, has never intervened.

I have already decided to distance myself and not go on vacations etc. My husband found this very difficult but understood.

Today I got the question from a friend to celebrate Christmas together (she also has no family). I immediately thought this was a nice idea.

When I suggested this to my husband he immediately said no. I find this very difficult because I am more or less obliged to celebrate my Christmas with someone who does not appreciate me. Because I have no family of my own, my husband finds it normal that I go with him to his family.

I think it's a shame that within my marriage I can't decide for myself what to do at Christmas.

If I had family, maybe there would just be a rotation.

35,1fufugz,AITA for telling my dad to look into a mirror and stop blaming mom for me not calling my stepmom 'mom' anymore?,"My parents divorced when I (17M) was a baby and my dad remarried when I was 5. When I was 7 I started to call my stepmom mom a little and that's what felt natural to me. They didn't ask me to do it. After I had said it several times my dad gave my mom a heads up about it. I heard him tell my stepmom about it when we got home. I was in the office doing homework at the time. Dad and my stepmom started trash talking mom. Dad said mom looked so hurt and offended. Then he and my stepmom said how shitty it was that she couldn't be happy for me and dad called my mom a big baby. My stepmom said she hoped my mom didn't stop me from calling her mom too. She also said it was sad that my mom was so selfish and put herself before me. All this because my mom *looked* hurt. Not even because she said something. Because she looked hurt.

I never called my stepmom again. I didn't want to hurt mom and I didn't feel like my dad and stepmom deserved for me to keep calling my stepmom mom too when they were trash talking my mom so much.

It was noticed. Dad would call my stepmom my mom in conversation sometimes as a test. Like go ask your mom or did you find your mom and I would always say; I asked 'Maire' or I found 'Marie'. I also told people I only had one mom and one dad and I had a stepmom when asked or if it came up. I'd do even if my dad or stepmom could hear and it bothered them so much.

Then one of my half siblings started calling my mom 'mom' and my dad and stepmom quickly and actually pretty harshly shut that down. When it happened randomly at times for a couple of years it resulted in a bit of a freak out. Which I found funny given mom couldn't even look hurt without being all kinds of terrible things in their opinion.

Now that I'm in my senior year of high school and almost 18 my dad has been more bothered by the fact I just, to them, randomly stopped calling my stepmom mom. And he brought it up to me with my stepmom in the room a few days ago. He told me I shouldn't let my mom influence my decision on who gets called mom and dad. He told me it seemed so sad that my stepmom was mom for a while and then I just used her name. He told me if mom really loved me she'd be happy for me. I told him it wasn't mom, that I heard everything the two of them said, that it made me re-evaluate whether my stepmom deserved to be called mom anymore and I decided nah, because they disrespected mom. Then I was like; so go look in a fucking mirror and stop blaming mom when she never even said anything to him and they trash talked her for how she looked.

Dad accused me of lying and said even if it is true, I was shitty for holding that against them so much and blaming him as harshly when they just wanted me to be able to love everyone. He said I was too willing to assign all the blame to him/them.

And he brought it up to me with my stepmom in the room a few days ago. He told me I shouldn't let my mom influence my decision on who gets called mom and dad. He told me it seemed so sad that my stepmom was mom for a while and then I just used her name. He told me if mom really loved me she'd be happy for me. I told him it wasn't mom, that I heard everything the two of them said, that it made me re-evaluate whether my stepmom deserved to be called mom anymore and I decided nah, because they disrespected mom. Then I was like; so go look in a fucking mirror and stop blaming mom when she never even said anything to him and they trash talked her for how she looked.

Dad accused me of lying and said even if it is true, I was shitty for holding that against them so much and blaming him as harshly when they just wanted me to be able to love everyone. He said I was too willing to assign all the blame to him/them.

36,1fuf8n1,AITA for setting boundaries with my roommate,"Backstory- I had a friend move in 5 months ago. They were having roommate troubles, and couldn‚Äôt afford something on their own. I had my spare room open up and I offered to split the rent 60/40 since the room is very small. I helped them move in. Their whole life fit in my car. Literally moved all of their stuff in one trip. They didn‚Äôt bring much of anything other than clothing, some personal care items, and some pantry goods. 

Fast forward a few months, I asked my friend/roommate to pay for half of a water filter. I sent the Venmo request, then when I got home that day I had a verbal conversation about sharing expenses for communal goods (because I was buying just about all of the household items and it adds up). 

They shared that they didn‚Äôt feel that they should have to pay half because they had purchased $30 worth of toilet paper a few months prior and contributed ‚Äúmany things‚Äù when they 1st moved in. My home was fully stocked when they moved in. About a month in we ran out of toilet paper. They went out and bought some. I thought it was a kind gesture since they hadn‚Äôt contributed much. 

Anyways, I went on to reiterate what my boundaries are for communal goods (which is splitting the costs evenly so that resentment- specifically on my end doesn‚Äôt build up) and whether or not we were on the same page. 

The verbal conversation didn‚Äôt amount to much, it got awkward and they changed the subject. A few days later, they declined the Venmo request and I texted the next day reiterating my boundary (see at end of the story) and if we weren‚Äôt on the same page, that‚Äôs fine, we will just buy our own household items. They responded with:

‚ÄúI hit deny on the payment yesterday bc i owe you for wine too so was going ask if you included the wine
? this is incredibly hurtful that i brought something up [toilet paper] & now you're being vigilant of it like this when all i did was deny a payment bc i was scared i was skimping you out after just having a talk‚Äù

I was caught off guard by their response, they went on to ignore me for 3 days!! They wouldn‚Äôt look at or speak to me even while hanging out with mutual friends. how was I supposed to know that they denied the payment just so they could factor in money for other things and resend it? The way I read this is they were upset by me not being a mind reader (which sounds like an a-hole thing to say).

38,1fuekub,WIBTA if I tried to sue my sister for not paying rent?,"For context: 

My great grandparents passed away years ago. Their house was sitting empty for years. The house is in the name of their trust, and is managed by a main trustee: my uncle. I (F24) have two younger sisters, we'll call them Jey (F23) and Elle (F21).

A year ago, in 2023, Jey was living with her bf at the time rent free but they broke up. Jey came to me and Elle (who were living with our parents) in a panic and asked if we'd be willing to move in together. She couldn't move in with us and our parents for various reasons so we needed to find somewhere else to stay. We all agreed, but couldn't find a place we could afford, so, with the permission of my uncle, we fixed up my great grandparents' house and moved in. The verbally agreed upon rent was $2,000. Due to the nature of our jobs: Jey would pay $1200, Elle would pay $400, and I would pay $200. The money is venmoed to my uncle every month. However, there was never a written lease agreement, this was all verbal, and done through Venmo. Nothing official.

Flash forward to a month after moving in, Jey gets a new boyfriend and spends all of her time at his house and is never home, but still paying rent so not super concerning. However after about 6 months, she gets fired from her well paying job. She's virtually NEVER home, and now can only pay $900 in rent. So Jey pays $900, Elle now pays $800, and I pay $300. Flash forward a few months of this, Jey is now NEVER home. EVER. Doesn't even stop by, just sends rent (sometimes late) and is never active in the gc. I go on vacation for a week, and get a text from Elle, telling me Jey came and moved all her stuff out. When I get back home at the beginning of September, Elle and I sit and have a conversation with Jey, and she states ""she's done putting her life and dreams on hold for us"" and it's ""time she starts her own life"" etc. Basically: she's moving out officially and not paying rent anymore. Elle and I verbally confirmed with Jey MULTIPLE times that she would pay the rest of September's rent on October 1st, and then she would be gone and done and Elle and I would have time to figure out a new place to stay for October. But Oct. 1st rolls around and Jey has not sent rent. Elle and I start to panic, texting her and calling her, and we get a wall of text stating Jey ""doesn't have the money and hasn't for a long time"" and ""how dare I for letting my younger sister scrimp and suffer and be in the negative trying to come up with $900 when I only pay $300"" and: she won't be paying. 

I only pay $300, and live here full time. She was paying $1200/$900 and wasn't ever here.

But when he told me his friends had organized the drugs, I asked him not to take part. He was annoyed at first because he‚Äôs already paid for them and can‚Äôt get his money back, but after a lengthy conversation, he reluctantly agreed not to use them.

For some background, my boyfriend and I have attended a few festivals together in the past, and he‚Äôs usually not one to take drugs. But at our last festival together, we both took some. During that event, he became super affectionate‚Äîmore than usual‚Äîand started holding hands and being touchy with another girl in our friend group. I tried to be chill about it because I know drugs can mess with people‚Äôs judgements, but then I saw him kiss the side of her face. I was upset and told him I wasn‚Äôt okay with it. He immediately stopped and apologized profusely. 

We talked it over when he was sober, and I made it clear that I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with him taking party drugs again if I wasn‚Äôt around. It wasn‚Äôt because I didn‚Äôt trust *him*, but because I‚Äôve seen how his behavior can change, and I didn‚Äôt want to worry about what might happen if I wasn‚Äôt there.

Last year, I began noticing tension involving Sam, Abby, and Lily. Sam was often the subject of negative remarks when they weren't around, but I didn't think much of it at first. Abby later told me she distanced herself because Sam‚Äôs boyfriend made her and Nhi uncomfortable, but they never communicated this to Sam. Although I didn‚Äôt condone bullying, I went along with the casual disrespect because I believed Sam was just annoying like the others had said. I now realize this was wrong.

Things changed when Sam joined a group chat I was in to play video games. They opened up about how Abby and Lily distanced themselves last year, and Sam had no idea why. Sam said they stayed silent to avoid making things worse and to protect their friends, especially after being bullied in the past. With all this new information, I started seeing things differently, but I wasn‚Äôt sure what to believe. I still valued Abby and Lily, so I didn‚Äôt want to fully accept that they might be bullies.

Then, things escalated. During a FaceTime call with Abby and Lily, Abby mentioned new people talking badly about Sam. She showed me a screenshot of a group chat where Jazmine, Gracie, and Nhi were making fun of Sam, even though some of them didn‚Äôt know Sam personally. I was shocked by how far the hate had gone, especially since it involved making fun of Sam‚Äôs looks. I had promised Sam I‚Äôd let them know if anything came up, so I sent them the screenshot. Sam then made it their profile picture with the names blurred.

After that, things spiraled out of control. Kyle, another friend, sent the screenshot to the group chat with Nhi, Gracie, and Casper to confront them. Abby soon confronted me, asking if I had sent the screenshot. I admitted to it, feeling guilty but believing I had done the right thing to protect Sam from the unnecessary hate knowing they didn‚Äôt do anything wrong. Abby also tried to tell my friend Maddie, but she had nothing to do with it, so I was practically pressured into telling her the drama as well.

But she said she felt really weird about it and told me I have to go shopping again to find a different ring, which I don‚Äôt want to do because this is the one I liked the most.

It‚Äôs been 48 hours, and she hasn‚Äôt texted or apologized. I‚Äôve been ready to move on and not bring it up again, but I feel like she‚Äôs still holding onto it.

So, AITA for sticking with the engagement ring I like and not seeing why this is such a big deal? Or should I have been more understanding of her feelings and considered picking a different style?

EDIT: my boyfriend and I went shopping over the weekend to pick out which style I liked. I haven‚Äôt even been proposed to yet, but he‚Äôs planning on doing it soon. This argument came up over me sending her which one I picked out that I liked the most. My friend has been engaged for 3 years and is starting to plan her wedding for next year but hasn‚Äôt set a date yet. 

I‚Äôm planning to get a 1 karat center diamond and she has a 2 karat diamond, so mine is significantly smaller than hers. The halo diamonds on mine are also smaller and daintier. Her bridge is intricate with swirlies and mine is just a plain one.",0.0,0.044367097318172455,0,1

44,1fue1sh,"AITA for not being ready, for my mum's new boyfriend to join us for Christmas? ","My (28F) parents (50s) divored at the beginning of this year, after 30+ years together. We (my sister and I) knew they had been unhappy for a long time, so we weren't surprised and were supportive of the divorce. 
Things started amicably, but turned ugly in the spring, when my mum found a boyfriend. The divorce hadn't gone through yet, and my dad reacted quite badly. Things have been tense since. 

My sister and I decided, that we should split up for Christmas this year, and ""take"" one parent each. I got my dad, but he asked me, if it was okay if he did something entirely different this year, and went on a holiday. I was supportive of this. 
This meant, that I was now free to join my sister and mum. But my mum is saying, that she would like her boyfriend to join us for Christmas. And I just don't feel ready for that. 
My point of view is, that this is the first Christmas after the divorce, and I would like to only have to cope with that. With this new normal, and not having my whole family together for Christmas. My feeling is, that it feels like way to much for me to cope with, if her boyfriend is there too. 

Now, I have met her boyfriend multiple times, and am fine with him. I'm just not ready for him to join us for Christmas yet. This year has been a lot for me, and I'm still trying to find my new normal, after the divorce. 

My mum keeps saying, that I'm being unreasonable, and my reaction is way to strong. That maybe I'm not handling the divorce well, because I live futher away (an hour and a half). She says, that I'm putting her in a difficult position, and that it's been a long time since the divorce (less than a year). 

I have the backup plan of joining my boyfriends family for Christmas instead. But, again, my mum thinks that is a very strong reaction. 

AITA, for not being ready for my mum's boyfriend to join us for Christmas? Or am I being unreasonable and childish? I feel like, that it's still so soon after the divorce, but my mum feels differently, as she says her and dad very divorced mentally for a long time before. 

(I would also feel the same way, if it was the other way around, and it was my dad wanting to bring his girlfriend to Christmas). 

Edit: Thanks for your judgments, you've given me something to think about. I just want to add, that I don't have a problem with my parents dating other people. I'm happy if they are happy, as they definitely deserve that! 
There I feel sad, is that Christmas was always a time spent with the whole family, and it will be weird, now that the family is split. It feels like a lot, that this will be different. 
While I am happy for my parents, I'm still dealing with the change, and it's going to take a bit of time for me to find my spot in this new normal. But I'm sure I will get there!

47,1fucqk7,AITA For making comment about father-in-law ,"My partners dad makes no effort with his kids. 

They are lucky if they see him 2-3 times a year. Only birthdays and Xmas. 

My partner used to message or call him, and was always the one making the effort. 
I was initially unaware that she was always the one initiating and keeping any sort of relationship they had going. I did eventually notice this myself. 

The last few years she has been making less of an effort with him, and it's becoming more noticeable that he just doesn't make any effort. 

Anyway, at the end of last year she decided to stop making any effort with him at all to see how long it would take for him to contact her. 

So, since December 23rd last year she has basically never heard or seen him, other than a few calls in January when his partner was in hospital and a phone call about a family bereavement in February. 

So, she has basically not seen or heard from him for over 9 months and he stays maybe 5 minutes away in the car. He also visits his partners daughter on a regular basis who just stays a few streets down from us. 

Cut to last week when we bumped into a family member of his partners son-in-law. They noticed my partner was pregnant and was asking about the baby and if her dad was excited about having a grandchild.
Myself and my partner said we have no idea how he felt because we never see him and he doesn't bother. 

Because I'm a bit pissed of about the whole situation I made a few comments to the family member about him being useless and that he makes no effort with his kids. I didn't really get into it, but I made them aware of the situation. 

Side note. We didn't tell him about the baby in person because we never see him. Anyway, we eventually decided to post about the baby on social media and he commented saying congratulations but has made made no effort to contact us or see how his only daughter is during the pregnancy or if she needs anything. And this was back in June.

Anyway, back to the family member. I also said that he made no effort to contact us after the big news my partner posted on social media and that we were a bit pee'd of about it. No call or visit. 

A few days after bumping into the family member, I get a big message from his partner. Something along the lines of:

(We are both happy about the new baby on the way, and that her dad did congratulated her on her social media post, but that it would have been nice to have been told face to face instead of reading it on social media. She has no idea about what has happened between my partner and her dad and why she has apparently cut him out of her life all of a sudden. She then went on to ask me not to bad mouth her partner to her family members and that I put the family member in an awkward situation by saying these things to them) 

Am I the asshole for making these comments? 

Is it weird that she has messaged me and not him, and that he doesn't make any effort with his kids. Especially when one is almost 8 months pregnant and the other has just gotten engaged.

I realised that as the event needed a gold coin to get in and Eliza had two (she implied that I could use it cause I didn't have one) but there was someone else with them so I wouldn‚Äôt get in. I sat with a girl I‚Äôm friends with (Chloe) and her friends who aren't part of my main friend group (the others were away) for lunch.

Context: in my friend group, Eliza, Millie and I are a trio, we used to be a 4 with pairs but my pair left ages ago so now we're a three and I still feel left out sometimes because Eliza will whisper in Millie‚Äôs ear and not tell me because ""I don't care"" or ""I won't understand"" and she was doing that a lot yesterday and I told her to stop and that I don‚Äôt like being left out so she told me that she‚Äôd tell me next week. Me and Millie are closer because in our trio we have the most in common but them two are still super tight.

They got back from the event with 10 mins left and I was chatting with Chloe in the corner. Millie asked me why I was in a corner and why I didn't come after and I pretty much said that she abandoned me but she said it was Eliza‚Äôs idea and she wanted to wait but I should have just walked to the event (it was 20 metres away) but I said I knew there wouldn't be a coin for me so there was no point and she said that I wouldntve been able to come anyway then so it didn't matter that they left me. She went back to the others after that and I kept talking to Chloe.

After school, Millie tapped me on the shoulder and I didn‚Äôt turn around and said go away but she said she just wanted to say bye so I turned around and I can‚Äôt remember if I said nothing or just ok but it was probably a bit too mean.

Millie started texting me and saying that if I don‚Äôt let her apologise this will never be over so I said she didn‚Äôt apologise (I don‚Äôt remember but maybe she did) and then I got a bit sarcastic and said she told me that I wouldnt have been able to come so they would have left me anyway and then I said great apology üëèüëèüëè. She was then texting me in all caps asking why it matters because if I couldn‚Äôt come why would they need to wait for me. After a bit I got sick of it and I didn‚Äôt want to have no friends cause we‚Äôre fighting so I said that I accept her apology.

Keep in mind that Eliza has not said a word to me since they left me.

We live in the UK but all live at different parts so we haven't been able to meet up since we all lived together. One of us made a groups chat and mentioned the possibility of going on holiday in the new year. We started looking at possible destinations. 

I mentioned this to my girlfriend and she asked if she was invited. I said no as it's just for the friendship group and no one is bringing their partners. We found a destination that was affordable and somewhere we all wanted to go. My girlfriend said she should be invited or I should cancel. 

She said the destination is somewhere she's wanted to go for a while so I just said we could go together another time. She said I'm being disrespectful for going on holiday with other woman and mentioned that me using my leave means we have less time to take together. 

I pointed out my leave reset in April and this holiday is going to be January or February so my leave will reset shortly after. She just said again that I was being disrespectful for going away with other women. I asked what was disrespectful about it but she couldn't elaborate.

53,1fubne8,AITA for getting my roommate kicked out?,"I (20F) recently got a new roommate (18F) this summer in a college apartment where roommates are randomly assigned. We both have dogs.

When my roommate first moved in, things were okay until I noticed she was really messy, and her dog was the main issue. I started noticing a disgusting smell in the apartment, and after checking the common areas, I realized it was coming from her room. I assumed she'd deal with it, but when I confronted her, she bought a carpet cleaner, which didn‚Äôt work. The smell persisted, and she didn‚Äôt get professional cleaning like she said she would.

She also left her dog alone for long periods, sometimes over 12 hours, during which the dog would bark. Although annoying, I could handle it. However, three incidents involving her dog were too much for me.

The first incident was when she traveled and claimed her sister would check on her dog, but no one came. I had to take care of the dog. When I told her to get a dog sitter because I couldn't keep watching her dog, she finally came back.

The second incident was when she went to the hospital, leaving her dog and a second unfamiliar dog in her room. I have a deep fear of this particular breed because of past attacks. I couldn‚Äôt enter her room out of fear, so I fed the dogs through the door. When she returned, I told her management had taken the stray dog away.

The final straw was the third incident. From Friday evening to Sunday afternoon, her dog was left alone. The apartment smelled, and the dog‚Äôs bowls were empty. I took care of her dog, but by Wednesday, the apartment stench was unbearable. I knocked on her door, but there was no answer. I entered her room and found piles of dog poop, the smell of dog pee, an open bag of Takis her dog had gotten into, flies everywhere, and no food or water for the dog. I cleaned up her room, fed her dog, and told apartment management. The fly infestation had spread to my room, and my dog was bitten by them, causing him to itch constantly. I could no longer tolerate the smell or the situation.

Management said there was no space to move me, and today my roommate sent me a passive-aggressive text accusing me of things I didn‚Äôt do and telling me to stay out of her business.

54,1fubh2a,AITA for changing plans on my mum? ,"I (36F) have a difficult relationship with my mum (62F). She left the family home and divorced my dad (68M) when I was young to be with her new partner and our relationship has been strained since then. Despite this I try to keep a good relationship with her the best I can - calling once a month, gifts and seeing her whenever I visit home (I live abroad).

During a recent visit to my home country in March my Mum got upset because I didn‚Äôt visit her immediately upon my return home, and it took me a few days to get to see her. For context I returned due to a recent diagnoses of PTSD and spent two weeks with my dad and he planned some family activities for me that he thought would help. I ended up getting tearful phone calls from my mum stating I loved my dad more and that she was bottom of the list. I reinforced that I loved her, explained my mental health and inability to plan and suggested she seek counselling to talk through some resolved feelings about her leaving. This didn‚Äôt go down well.

I recently revisited home and mum accidentally booked her vacation at the same time as my visit, this meant we only had one day to catch up before I flew home. I told her I‚Äôd put that day aside (despite it being a busy packing day) and suggested we visit the local seaside town as my partner wanted to visit. A week before our visit I received an invite from a friend to this seaside town. My friend has terminal cancer, lives 4 hours away and is limited in what she can do currently. The seaside town is midway between our homes and had some activities she was able to managed whilst going through chemotherapy. 

I text my mum asking if we could do something different as we had planned to visit with my friend and she became very upset because I attempted to change plans. It became apparent that me doing so felt like another rejection and that she wasn‚Äôt important. I was under the impression that it was seeing each other that was important and not the particular activity. I stated we could still go if she wanted, and gave her three other options for days out. She sent several passive aggressive texts about how she didn‚Äôt matter, how she was ill too and telling me to cancel. She has now stopped responding to my messages.

55,1fub7da,AITA for trying to uninvite my friends,"Bit of a backstory. My (22M) girlfriend (21F) and I have been together for 3 years. Last year we set up two of our mutual friends (let's call them Claude and Claudia) from different places in the UK when they came over for my birthday, they have no been in a relationship for around 9 months.

Claudia's parents are loaded and she and Claude have recently both moved there full time (we live in same area) and are not paying bills or anything. Unfortunately they still haven't managed to secure jobs despite searching for a couple months, whilst my girlfriend and I both got one pretty quick. 

I'm started to get annoyed at their different attitude and sensing them becoming really tight, despite still going out for dinner and on holidays. My girlfriend had some family issues so we had to rush home and get them to take over some dog sitting we had going for a couple days. They asked if the they could be paid the amount of days they've done, which I guess is fair enough, but also tried to argue they should get an extra day when it's in nights. We agreed to just split the last day. 

Further on I went abroad for work recently and brought them back some stuff which they said thanks for but didn't exactly seem grateful or anything, maybe that's just my interpretation. 

Finally, I manage to pull 4 tickets (yes I asked for 4 because I was thinking about them) to a big sporting event coming up. The tickets usually go for like ¬£500 but the place is an hour's drive away. I was hoping in return they'd happily offer to drive us there.. nope they want me to drive. I then messaged saying to my friend how about I cover fuel and parking (which is pretty expensive) and you get the food. He answers that he'd be worst off by like a couple quid.. I haven't answered since but I really want to just invite other people at this point.  My girlfriend says she doesn't want to burn bridges with them as they're our only friends in the area, but honestly I don't get it. You're being driven there and I went out of my way to get you tickets to come with us which are worth a lot and you're moaning about a couple quid? Yes, they might be short on money but they still go out for dinner so surely you can spare a little bit, and it's not as if they pay for rent or bills of any kind.

56,1fuacvo,AITA for refusing to go on an upcoming vaction/trip with my family? ,"I 16F mostly refused to go on any long family trips especially if it's with my mom and step dad who are in their early 30s (along with my little sister, who's in 1st grade). The reason is due to the fact that I'll be babysitting and the arguments between my mom and step dad. Ever since my little sister started school in general, I have become her babysitter. I love her with all my heart but I babysat her for the two whole summer's already and we didn't go outside once since I can't handle her by myself if I were to take her out. Even before summer, I took some days off of school to watch her and picked her up every Friday or watch her after school during the week. Hell, even on the weekends, I watched her while they did laundry and shopping. I really want a break, I have no free time for myself or to study. 

My relationship with my mom is confusing. We're close and talk daily, but I live with my grandparents. Yes, I vist her, but I couldn't find myself to live with her because of her current relationship with my stepdad. On our last trip to an aunts house, there was a huge argument (Mom vs. Stepdad) that happened in front of the whole family, and that has caused an even bigger strain on our bond. Even after that my mom still wants to do a little trip with just us back to Florida but I can already tell how it's going to end, because it's a cycle that I can't stop. I've already told her no, but her response was that ""you need to go because you have to watch your sister and cousin while we're out since you're 16"". On that last trip, it was supposed to be a little vacation for everyone but I ended up having to babysit my little sister, cousin 13F and another aunt's baby in the living room the whole time we stayed. I dressed my sister, put her to bed, made sure she ate and stayed with her the whole time.   

I feel like an asshole and I don't know what to do. Bringing up why I don't want to go doesn't work since it gets brushed off. Plus, I really want to lock in on my studies for this school year because it's junior year. I do sympathize with my mom a lot, and I love her, but I can't keep doing this. I've always done what she asked for without complaining when it comes to helping out. We've been through a lot together, I've seen firsthand how toxic unhealthy relationships can be ever since I was a baby. When I was younger, it's been my goal to protect her and support her. That's mainly why I feel like an asshole, I don't know what to do to fix everything. It just feels like everything's my responsibility, stopping the fights and taking care of my sister. 

I know that I'm not a good older sister/daughter, but I'm trying my best. Am I the asshole for not wanting to go on this vacation?

57,1fua6h1,AITA for standing at an event?,"So I (26f) bought tickets to go to the Melbourne Royal Show (like a fair? If you‚Äôre not from Australia) because I was feeling a bit depressed and wanted to see the barn animals and the dog shows they were putting on for a pick me up.

One particular show was a dog show that had some races and agility and a big pool for the docks to jump into. The setup was a ground level fenced off area which had a little agility course set in front, the pool behind it and a large screen set up behind that. 

The area for the crowd was essentially a field that you could view the show from three sides. The back area was sectioned off for the dogs and owners. The shows had several viewings and the previous viewing I only managed to see right at the end. But when I was there, the crowd surrounding the show, were all standing. Mostly kids up the front and parents behind them, but a good blend of children and adults.

Because I really wanted to watch the show and was leaving right after, I set up camp like about 45 minutes before the show time with my spot and I sat and waited and eventually some other people did the same.

When it was about 10 minutes before the show was about to start, I stood up because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything behind the fence that was set up.

I noticed also a pram parked right beside me. 

Just as the show was about to start I feel a tug at my backpack. I turned around and it was an older man (like maybe sixties) sat on the grand in a half laying position behind the pram who asked if I was going to stand for the whole show and I said yes, of course.

Now at this point the two sides of the fence (I was in the middle at the front) were packed with standing people and the people on the field behind me were half if not mostly sitting which he pointed out saying that people behind me weren‚Äôt able to see if I was standing, which while true would still be the case because now the fence was surrounded by a bunch of children standing. And I said -sorry, but I will be standing because I can‚Äôt see anything behind the fence, and that the people had legs and if they wanted to see they could use them and stand up them selves- which he then started getting irate and says ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt care‚Äô (about me not being able to see) and argued his point again but I said sorry I‚Äôm not moving and turned around again.

He tugs on my backpack again and starts getting even more irate to which point I argue that his pram was just as likely to block peoples view as my fat ass was, to which he starts arguing even more. And I just repeat. ‚ÄòNo sir‚Äô to his arguments and turn back around to the show. He starts talking rudely about me as the show starts and purposefully gets up and looks around me brushing against my backpack, to which I go to him ‚Äòare you good?‚Äô And he finally steps down.

By this point I‚Äôm shaking in anger and am really upset and mostly everyone has stood up by that point anyway because the kids are crowding the fence and I didn‚Äôt even get to enjoy the show.  

So AITA.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-02,"AITA for standing at an event? So I (26f) bought tickets to go to the Melbourne Royal Show (like a fair? If you‚Äôre not from Australia) because I was feeling a bit depressed and wanted to see the barn animals and the dog shows they were putting on for a pick me up.

One particular show was a dog show that had some races and agility and a big pool for the docks to jump into. The setup was a ground level fenced off area which had a little agility course set in front, the pool behind it and a large screen set up behind that. 

The area for the crowd was essentially a field that you could view the show from three sides. The back area was sectioned off for the dogs and owners. The shows had several viewings and the previous viewing I only managed to see right at the end. But when I was there, the crowd surrounding the show, were all standing. Mostly kids up the front and parents behind them, but a good blend of children and adults.

Because I really wanted to watch the show and was leaving right after, I set up camp like about 45 minutes before the show time with my spot and I sat and waited and eventually some other people did the same.

When it was about 10 minutes before the show was about to start, I stood up because I wouldn‚Äôt be able to see anything behind the fence that was set up.

A month later, after our class tests, I noticed they excelled in studies and always knew things before they were taught. I got suspicious. At our coaching institute, I borrowed Sarah's phone and saw her texts. I discovered they'd been taking chemistry classes from Mr. Tim, a chem teacher from school since the beginning of the session. They also had a physics teacher, tho they said they didn't when I kept asking them. I felt betrayed. They kept denying it, even after I asked again.
Not being able to keep it in, I told Pamela, Jane, and Lara.
One fine day, i realise Sarah and Sam blocked me on the texting app. When I asked, Sarah said I told everyone about their tuitions. I apologized, explaining I only told my close friends .
Apparently , Pamela told Sam about it. She somehow got to know it and asked Pamela if she knew anything about it, Pamela didn't have a way to escape so she had to confess.
Now, whenever they talk about Pamela in her absence, they say ""don't tell her this for god's sake"" Janet said, ""You can't be trusted, we finally know the real you."" Sandy called me two-faced.

The woman in the photo was a little person (I don't know the correct term so please feel free to correct) sat on top of a fridge, obviously having a good time at a college party. At the bottom it noted ""20 \_\_NAME\_\_"". 

  
I said to myself ""I know he's trying to dunk on our rival but this seems just icky to me"", So here is the text lines that ensued. AITA?

  
Me: ""What's going On here?""

B: ""Tinder Match""

Me: ""I See that, What are you doing on tinder?""

B: ""I'm Not, Shared On Twitter  \*Redacted\* College Match, She's a little Person""

Me: \*Swing and a miss Ron Swanson Meme\*

B : ""Different Strokes for different folks""

Me: ""I just don't understand the joke here... fuck \*REDACTED\*  but are we just making someone for having differences? Just seems like you wanted to be an asshole for no reason""

B: ""Apologies if I offended you""

Me : ""That wasn't making a joke, you just decided to make yourself look like an ass""

B: Might wanna lay off I apologized only person looking like an ass is you"" 

Other friend: ""How about that X vs. Y game!""

Me: "" If I wanted to look like an ass, I'd try and make fun of random almost children half my age""

B: ""lol""

Me: ""You should apologize for being a little bitch, not 'because you offended me. You didn't offend me, you acted like a general ass and should reflect on your own behavior. Everyone  would expect a 40 year old to know belter than this""

B: "" Gotta love the true colors coming out lol"" (i wasn't really sure about what this meant....)

  
So there's the end. The group text that's usually buzzing all week for collage football has been silent. ",2.0,1.0537158250808716,1,0
64,1fu9jht,AITA for Calling Out My Partner‚Äôs New Neglect of Cleanliness? ,"My (36 F) partner‚Äôs (36 NB) cleanliness has diminished since the release of some new video game stuff.

When I go to visit them since the release, their room is much dirtier‚Äî smashed food on the floor, bags of garbage, their cat‚Äôs litter box completely full, dirty clothes on the floor. They rent a room in a house and that room is the only spot we can hang out when I visit. 

Since this shift, they are not vacuuming or cleaning and my cat allergy has been really bad, even with medication. 

They have also been smelling bad. There is some kind of new funk from the bottom half of their body that is really hard to stomach. I had to change my sheets and wash my car seat the last times they slept over and rode in my car. I gave them the benefit of the doubt for a couple weeks. I didn‚Äôt want to hurt their feelings and thought maybe there was a good excuse. 

After about three weeks, when they slept over, I tried to gently tell them. I asked if they were wearing the same pants from the day before and offered to wash them. I asked if they wanted to shower. They got the hints because they agreed to both. They said they were ‚Äúmortified‚Äù and it was their ‚Äúnightmare to subject [me] to [their] bad odor.‚Äù I told them everyone stinks sometimes and I joked I would for sure ‚Äúpay [them] back‚Äù with my odor some day. I figured they would make more of an effort again to keep up their hygiene. They did not. 

They don‚Äôt drive so the next day I offered to take them grocery shopping. I texted them in the morning and they said yes. That evening I texted them letting them know I was on my way. They told me to give them ‚Äú22 minutes‚Äù because they were gaming. They got into my car smelling again, clearly neglecting bathing, and wearing dirty, stained pants from the day before. I don‚Äôt think they even changed their underwear.

I had to drive with the windows open. I was mad. They expected me to wait for them to finish their game and they didn‚Äôt even bother putting clean clothes on to spend time with me.

I told them they smelled again and I could see they didn‚Äôt shower or put on clean clothes. I did say ‚Äúit is grossing me out,‚Äù and I was clearly mad by the tone of my voice. I also brought up how they haven‚Äôt cleaned their place and I am upset that they don‚Äôt bother to clean one room for us to hang out when I clean my whole house for them when they come to visit. I expressed my concern that the shift in cleanliness is correlated to the new gaming. 

In the moment they were hurt and embarrassed. The next day they texted me telling me that their hobbies are a part of who they are, so me not liking them playing a game is evidence I don‚Äôt like them. They also said their lack of cleanliness is due to depression, not gaming and I am unsupportive of their mental health because of how I am acting. They said I called them, ‚Äúvile and disgusting‚Äù and when I said I never said that and don‚Äôt think that, they told me I was gaslighting them.

My gfs parents are strictly anti-muslim, and I...happen to be muslim.
Even though I'm an atheist, and I've no problem converting, it's still an issue for them. Not to mention they absolutely hate the fact that she's got a bf 
So a couple of days ago, her brother contacted me saying that I shouldn't talk to her anymore, and that they won't like it if I did.
So, I did exactly that, told her that we can't do this anymore since her parents openly hate me ( it's been 9 months since we started dating, I thought her parents would change, but they didn't ) and now her brother has told me to stop things as well. 
Cut to her calling her parents and yelling at them. He dad doesn't like how her brother dealt with the situation, calling him a 'goon' but upon enquiring about his opinion of me , he still absolutely hates me and wants me gone. This again, made me realise that things won't go well, and leave
Ofc , my gf didn't like it , she and her friends called me a coward for not staying and fighting. But I rly didn't know wt else I could do. I didn't wanna cause trouble and make it worse for her , cuz the way I see things, this was bound to happen anyway, as they hate me.
The thing is... My gf has certain mental issues
So me leaving her made her have a complete breakdown while she was in university, which then got her to psychiatrist, who then diagnosed her with depression and anxiety.
Her mother asked the doc about me, as in "" what am I supposed to do here, support them or no?"" And the doc said it's best to not answer that question. The doc then told her that it's better to leave me if I'm keeping a condition ( that being I need her parents approval to continue with this relationship, as I don't wanna cause chaos ). She then told me all this, and I said the same thing that I told her earlier again. But then, she went crying to her mom about it who then said she'll think about it after I land a job and get of age.
Now, I don't know if her mother said it to calm her down, or If she really meant it. But I'm staying with her as of now, since she needs me, and there's a chance that her parents might agree with this relationship. If they don't, this this same incident will happen again, and she's gonna be in more pain.

66,1fu98p7,AITA for using a shared dishwasher? ,"AITA for using a shared dishwasher?

In an assigned roommate situation. Roommate is angry that I put dirty dishes in the dishwasher when they also had dishes in the dishwasher. Initially they took mine out and I said they have to share the dishwasher causing the dispute. 

Roommate wants to split kitchen in half, they get the counters with the sink.  I can use the sink but only get counter space next to stove. It‚Äôs much smaller and moving dishes from sink across always ends up with water on the floor requiring clean up. 

Issue is that I want to put my dishes in the dishwasher as I dirty them and then run it when it‚Äôs full. They only want me to use the dishwasher on specific days and only if they don‚Äôt have items in it. I‚Äôm not allowed to touch their items. 

They also leave half the sink filled with their items for more than a day at a time and have a drying rack next to the sink. 

I offered to buy their preferred detergent and wash any items they add to mine but they refused to allow me to use the dishwasher except on specific days of the week.  I really hate dishes piled in the sink and since we can‚Äôt mingle items, both parts of the sink would have dirty dishes all the time making it hard to use (think fill a Brita water pitcher). 

So I offered to just not use the dishwasher if I could have counter space for a drying rack (like they do). They found this unreasonable. 

My position is I pay for the ability to wash dishes any day, not only if my roommate allows me to. I also don‚Äôt want to spend half the week or more with dirty dishes stacked or spend everyday hand washing and drying all my items or constantly mopping up the floor. 

Honestly I can‚Äôt believe this is a real argument but they got so worked up they started crying because I won‚Äôt agree to a dishwasher use schedule. So AITA? 


For context: I‚Äôve already agreed to everything else they asked and compromised on temperature settings. This is the only request I didn‚Äôt immediately agree to. 

I might be the asshole because they said they can‚Äôt have their dishes in with mine because they are ‚Äúimmune compromised‚Äù but that was after multiple other reasons were given that I didn‚Äôt agree to & their habits directly conflict with immune compromised - eg not routinely cleaning, plants and dying flowers left around, not using trash cans/bags (trash left in paper bags on the floor or on counters).  Also housing literally has a process for medical conditions to be accommodated and they haven‚Äôt used them. Also they don‚Äôt insist on cleaning the dishwasher or sanitizing anything.

I‚Äôm in my last year of high school and I‚Äôve been dating my gf for around a year. To an outsider our relationship seems perfect. We has some issues but we work through them. We love each other and always spend time together. My family likes my gf and her family likes me. To sum it up my relationship is what a lot of people dream of.

 Now recently we‚Äôve been going out with my gf‚Äôs best friend and we live close so on the way home I walk with her and we just talk. I have such a good time and I just can‚Äôt stop thinking of her. We have so much in common and we‚Äôre the same type of person. I have a lot more in common with her than my gf. I didn‚Äôt realize how different me and my gf were until then and talking to her made me realize I don‚Äôt love my gf as much as I thought I did. 

Recently all I can think about is her friend and it‚Äôs bugging me out cause I know it‚Äôs wrong and that I should push my feelings away but I just can‚Äôt. For further context I‚Äôm not a bad bf or anything either. Everyone always tells me how much of a good bf I am. I always give my time, money and all my efforts to make my gf happy. If she‚Äôs ever sick I‚Äôll skip school to take care of her. If she‚Äôs ever sad I‚Äôll buy her snacks and go to her house and cheer her up. I know the solution is obvious and I should just ignore my feelings but it‚Äôs hard to just push them down. I have no chance with her to begin with I just can‚Äôt stop thinking of her. I honestly just needed to rant and I can‚Äôt really tell this anyone.What should I do? I don‚Äôt know what and I just need advice. Any comments would be much appreciated. Thank you for reading.

Edit: Thank you so much for all the replies. I woke up this morning and read them all. I‚Äôm on my way to school so I will definitely reply later. Something did happen last night though. When I talk to the best friend it often happens that I vent about my current relationship. I know it‚Äôs not right but I have no one else to tell this too.

68,1fu8v9k,AITA for cutting off a friend after she chose a guy over our friend group?,"Me (19F) and my friend who we‚Äôll call S (17F) are both sophomores in college. We became friends as a part of a larger group of about 10 people in the first month of freshman year and have all been close friends ever since. We would do everything together as a group: eat dinner, study, go on day trips, late night chats, etc.

This all changed this past March, when she met this guy P (20M). They both worked at the same place on campus and started hanging out. After a few rough relationships, S was finally single and was able to find herself. Well, she started getting REALLY close with P and we all thought ‚Äúthis is great! finally a good guy that will treat her right.‚Äù Boy were we wrong. Every day we‚Äôd hear from S about how P would flake on their plans minutes before, rant about his ex that he‚Äôd been broken up with for 2 years, and would trauma dump on her. Of course, we were sympathetic, I mean it was her third attempt at trying to find a nice guy and it was not working out. This was fine until like the fifth time she was ranting to us. Then it got annoying. 

Summer break rolled around and it was crickets on her end. Coming back to school, we learned that she had been texting him all summer and stalking his location AND his ex gf‚Äôs location to make sure they weren‚Äôt hanging out. We all tried talking reason into her, but she was convinced she was in love with him. All the while he was basically defining their situation as fwb and she wanted an actual relationship.

This cycle has been continuing ever since we hot back to campus, and we had finally had enough. We told her we did not think P was good for her, and she blew up at us and has not talked to us in a week. We were supposed to go to a concert together last week, and when I asked her if I still needed to drive her there she did not reply. I later found out she got her brother to buy a ticket and drive her there. Without telling me. So, what did I do? I unfollowed her and have been ignoring her, hoping to forget it all. She is now talking shit behind my back saying I have been excluding her and I have cut her off for no reason. AITA??

Also, P was one of the reasons S is now on probation with the school for encouraging her to drink a lil too much and then the police found her outside our dorm.

69,1fu8tps,AITA for advising my friend to potentially get my former club disbanded?,"I (20M) transferred from my college after last fall, and in doing so I also left the club I was president of (I discussed this with my exec board and made sure I left them with anything they needed and made sure they knew I was always available for advice). I thought everything was fine, however earlier today I learned that one of my old friends (20F), I'll call her M, just resigned from the current exec board. Now some context, this club was her life. She loved this club so dearly anyone who knows her knows that it would take a LOT to get her to leave. So, I messaged her asking what's up, and proceed to have a 1.5 hour long phone call getting caught up. I learned that the current exec board has been suggesting changes that go against the club's bylaws, going behind M's back to make decisions that are technically under her jurisdiction, hiding financial statements from her, and berating her for having medical problems (this girl is allergic to life.) and having to leave a couple meetings early. I also learned that the current VP, and my ex-roommate (20M) has been shit-talking about me since I left (I would send him things like a meme or an animal video from the zoo like once a month and the only time he responded was after I wishes him happy birthday). My response to this was (with M's permission) talking about this whole situation with some of the club's alums, writing essentially a ""fuck you"" message to the exec chat (they still had me as an ""exec consultant"") and saying that all the resources I've been giving them I wouldn't be supplying anymore (almost every other alum also has separately made the same decision, 90% of their free resources are alum) before leaving the server, and advising M to go to the club advisor and student accountability to try and get that exec board to either get their shit together or disband. The president before me also is very close to emailing the college himself.

I (20M) transferred from my college after last fall, and in doing so I also left the club I was president of (I discussed this with my exec board and made sure I left them with anything they needed and made sure they knew I was always available for advice). I thought everything was fine, however earlier today I learned that one of my old friends (20F), I'll call her M, just resigned from the current exec board. Now some context, this club was her life. She loved this club so dearly anyone who knows her knows that it would take a LOT to get her to leave. So, I messaged her asking what's up, and proceed to have a 1.5 hour long phone call getting caught up. I learned that the current exec board has been suggesting changes that go against the club's bylaws, going behind M's back to make decisions that are technically under her jurisdiction, hiding financial statements from her, and berating her for having medical problems (this girl is allergic to life.) and having to leave a couple meetings early. I also learned that the current VP, and my ex-roommate (20M) has been shit-talking about me since I left (I would send him things like a meme or an animal video from the zoo like once a month and the only time he responded was after I wishes him happy birthday). My response to this was (with M's permission) talking about this whole situation with some of the club's alums, writing essentially a ""fuck you"" message to the exec chat (they still had me as an ""exec consultant"") and saying that all the resources I've been giving them I wouldn't be supplying anymore (almost every other alum also has separately made the same decision, 90% of their free resources are alum) before leaving the server, and advising M to go to the club advisor and student accountability to try and get that exec board to either get their shit together or disband. The president before me also is very close to emailing the college himself.

The reason we stopped being friends was because she would be so clingy to the point where I wanted to go off the grid. Because of this I decided to end our friendship. 

We were friendly with eachother but we didn't hang out like we used to. Recently we started becoming friends again and I thought it would be different this time because I could clearly see that she matured. Unfortunately I was wrong. For the last few weeks she's been calling me non-stop as soon as my work ends and she's been wanting to make plans with me. If I said no then she wouldn't talk to me for a day or two. She's also been complaining about me having to work.

She's never worked a job in her life because shes blessed enough to not have to. It just really irked me when she started making jokes about getting me fired from my job so she could hang out with me more.

Here's where I might be the asshole. I got fed up over her trying to be with me every second of the day so I started making excuses as to why I couldn't hang out with her.

Today, however, things changed as my stepfather‚Äôs work situation got dire and he won‚Äôt be able to go on the trip anymore. As I already expected when I heard the news, my mother called me and begged for me to join her in her trip. The trip would be two days from now and I‚Äôd be staying about 12days away, missing a college test and most importantly, I‚Äôd miss a pivotal moment of my final thesis which is prototyping, leaving it all up to my group with pretty much a two-day warning.

83,1fu5dch,AITA for moving out after I lost my job?,"I (24) moved to Canada less than a year ago to be with my spouse. It took 7 months to find work, draining my savings and leaving me teetering on my credit card debt for a few months.

The job I got was in a city 2.5 hours away from my partner's home. So I sublet rented a basement room in the city for work and drove back and forth on the weekends. The person I was renting from is a bit odd to me. European, a traveler, a language teacher, eclectic, she's in her 50s and her cat is in his 20s (that part is relevant).

So with her family in Europe, she is often awake between 11am and 1am. At first it wasn't bad, I also went to bed late despite needing to be awake at 8am for this job. But then it got later and later, her not going to sleep until 4am or later. I would hear every movement above me. I couldn't wear earpuds or plugs because I need to hear my alarms going off (which she didn't allow to be too loud). I didn't wake up enough and was let go this morning, tail end of my probationary period.

So I need to break lease. I can't afford to send her $800 a month in a city not close to my partner. I messaged her to talk to me when she woke up, which was at 4:30pm and she said she was too busy we'll talk later. I texted the situation, asked if maybe I could get part of Oct rent back. Unread. I interrupted a lesson to give back her key and tell her to check her messages.

After the lesson she came to me and started crying, saying that with her upcoming project (2 month charity trip to Peru Oct 24) and her cat's vet bills (tri-weekly food and fluid injections because he won't eat or drink) she can't afford me moving out. She can't afford the full rent for the house during her leave and she's too busy to find a new tenant. She begged me to look for a new job. 

I told her I can't afford rent and have to move back with my partner. She pleaded that she can't afford it, that she rented to me because I would be here till Feb, and that she can't give me my security deposit. She says she needs me to be paying rent while she's in Peru.

I already didn't feel comfortable here with 1 how little room I get for what I'm paying, and 2 how weird she is about the cost of things like using the washer and dryer. But was willing to pay when I had the funds if I transferred to where I needed to be. But without an income I can't. As said, getting the job I just lost took 7 months to get.

84,1fu59je,AITA for potentially dropping out of a wedding a month away?,"Throwaway in case the bride and groom are on Reddit

More of a would we be the aholes

In May of 2023 a long time friend of mine got engaged to her bf. It‚Äôs one of those friendships where she and I are decently close (she calls me her best friend) and our significant others are friends because we‚Äôre friends. 

They asked us to be In their wedding about 6 months into the engagement (November 2023) and we agreed, thinking there wouldn‚Äôt be much involved. When we got married we paid for the bridesmaids dresses, makeup and hair, and had a local wedding, and the groomsmen suits were only $90 a piece plus alterations so we kept it pretty affordable because we didn‚Äôt have a lot of money and knew our friends didn‚Äôt either.

Now to the issue: their wedding is in a month and they have put off every important aspect of the wedding until the last minute. The venue was picked maybe 6 months ago, dresses were chosen 2 months ago, hotel was chosen yesterday. They chose an out of state wedding where no one lives so everyone has to fly in and it‚Äôs adding up all at once. We were thinking it would maybe cost us a few hundred dollars for everything but they aren‚Äôt shelling out a DIME. After everything is said and done it‚Äôs going to cost us over $2000 for her wedding/bachelorette (which is only $250 each)/ flights, rental car, cheap place to stay, etc. not to mention that the groom keeps planning things in the wrong group chat and leaving my husband out of the loop on things like what day his bachelor party is and when to get a suit.

I have dropped subtle hints about trying to mitigate the costs a little bc all of her bridesmaids have said they‚Äôre on a budget but they‚Äôre still having to shell out $1000 each. Then when that didn‚Äôt help I outright told her we couldn‚Äôt afford to pay for a $400 suit- that they specifically asked the groomsmen to get bc the place they‚Äôre going through said if all the groomsmen buy their suits through this shop the groom gets his free- she didn‚Äôt acknowledge anything, only said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not $400, it‚Äôs $329‚Äù and moved on. It‚Äôs been like that the whole way, every time I mention that the cost is adding up and it‚Äôs getting expensive, I get ‚Äúyeah, well‚Ä¶..‚Äù and a topic change. 

She mentioned the rehearsal dinner and I asked what the plan was since the grooms family usually pays for that, and she said ‚Äúyeah about that‚Ä¶ his mom was going to pay but she‚Äôs not invited anymore we were just going to ask everyone to pay for themselves for it‚Äù.

WWBTA if we just told them we can‚Äôt do it and drop out of the wedding a month out? We have two kids on top of this and we‚Äôre not close to homeless or anything but we have one income and asking us to shell out $2k while she offers nothing, not even a thank you, just seems very entitled and selfish.",Asshole,2024-10-02,"AITA for potentially dropping out of a wedding a month away?

* My mom is a mild hoarder and their house is a mess
* The cat could knock over either precious belongings or items that would be dangerous if they came crashing down from a high shelf
* My dad is 90 and uses a walker and is blind in one eye and deaf in one ear, has mild dementia, and arthritis
* They have two small dogs that have had almost no experience with cats
* They did not properly train the dogs and my dad gets mad when they scratch at him
* He almost killed one dog because he dropped a bunch of pills on the floor and wasn't able to clean them up and the dog ate them
* They do not properly groom the dogs or clean up after them so I suspect it will be the same with the cat
* If he has any more health issues he will likely have to move to a senior's home and my mom will have to sell their house
* My mom who is a good bit younger is quite busy with her work and volunteering and trips and will not be around much to care for it
* None of their children can really help them with any of this (or when we try we are rebuffed)
* I worry the cat will not be looked after well enough and that is not fair to it

86,1fu4jrl,AITA For Using My Friend's Eras Tour Ticket?,"In October 2023, my best friend Sam and I registered for the Taylor Swift Miami concert presale. Sam got two presale codes, and I didn‚Äôt get any. She offered me one, and I accepted. Since I was at work, my little sister used my laptop to try and get tickets. My sister and I had gone to the Tampa show that year when my mom won last-minute tickets. 

The Miami show happens to be on my sister‚Äôs birthday, and my mom wanted to take my family since she and my sister missed the Tampa show. We planned to buy four tickets, but my sister couldn‚Äôt secure any in the presale. We were disappointed, but knew the resale prices would be insane, so we decided not to go.

Sam was able to secure four tickets for herself, her mom, her friend, and her friend‚Äôs mom. A month ago, Sam told me her mom wanted to sell the tickets because she and her friend‚Äôs mom watched some conspiracy theories about Taylor and didn‚Äôt want to attend. Sam was upset about it and told me the situation. After a few days, I asked if she‚Äôd consider selling the tickets to my family since they weren‚Äôt going anymore. She told me she would be upset if I went because I had already seen the Eras Tour twice (once when my aunt surprised me with tickets in London for my birthday). She felt it wouldn‚Äôt be right for me to go, knowing how upset she was.

I told her I understood her reasoning, but asked if she could still sell the tickets to my mom so she could take my little sisters, as my mom missed the chance last year. Sam then started texting my mom about selling the tickets.

I understand why Sam would be upset with me going, but she told me she was selling the tickets to my mom for slightly over face value (instead of reselling for much more) because she wanted them to go to my sister rather than a stranger. I thought she would understand that I also wanted to go and celebrate with my family. I‚Äôd have to travel to Miami with them and sit out while they go to the concert.

Recently, my mom mentioned that Sam was hinting she might go with us, which seemed shady since Sam had told me she wasn‚Äôt allowed to go. She also told me she paid $150 per ticket, but texted my mom they paid $200. Sam and her mom plan to use the money to travel to Germany to see Gracie Abrams since Sam‚Äôs mom agreed to take her there after missing Gracie‚Äôs opening performance for Taylor.

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt understand why she‚Äôs so insistent on being upset if I go to Miami. I understand this would be my third Eras Tour, my mom really wants us to go for my sister‚Äôs birthday, and I know my sister would be sad if we didn‚Äôt share the experience together.

87,1fu4edq,AITA for not travelling for Christmas with a baby?,"AITA for not traveling for Christmas with a baby?

My side of the family doesn't celebrate Christmas, my husband's family does. We have been together for 7 years and apart from 2 years spent every Christmas at my ILs who live overseas, 1.5 hrs on the plane. It ends up being a whole day of travelling as we need to get trains and once we land it's another 50min car journey. Husband and I have our first baby who will be 5 months at Christmas. I was looking forward to creating our own traditions, and needless to say am hesitant to travel with a baby during RSV season, it's not only the flight but also train rides and big family gatherings that will be crowded. My husband has really laid on the guilt. He asked me why I wanted to separate him from his family. That he wants to go see them, that it's the only tradition they have etc etc. He thinks Christmas alone with me and the baby will be miserable, which is honestly so insulting. For the record, I am the only one in our relationship making an effort to decorate the house each year, I love cooking and I bake cookies every year before Christmas. At my IL's the food isn't great tbh, they don't bake and they don't like cooking plus we don't eat meat, and each year my husband and I basically cook our own Christmas dinner at their house. We do play boardgames at theirs but otherwise they just sit and watch TV. It's not my idea of Christmas and I want to start fun traditions now that I have a child of my own.

Above everything I am sad my husband seems to view family time with his parents more important than time with me and our LO. He works a lot and we don't have a lot uninterrupted family time just the three of us, which already caused issues. 


EDIT: 
To answer a few questions: 
- both our families live in different countries than where we live, we're all in Europe. We usually visit his family twice a year and I have made a real effort to build good relationships with his family, however we typically visit my family only every 2 years together. Everyone is free to visit us. 

- His family stayed with us every 2nd month for just short of a week since the baby was born, so it's not like they haven't seen each other in a long time. 

- My family don't celebrate Christmas but they celebrate other family events like big family summer bbq, New Year's and other little special events. We typically don't go to them as it often doesn't line up with the work schedule.

- RSV is my main concern. I have a hospital background and am well informed. I don't want to take the risk. My grandmother is over 100 yrs old and hasn't seen the baby yet in person for the same reason - he's too small for us to travel at the few slots where infant vaccinations, passport, time off, etc all work out. And baby can't be vaccinated for RSV yet. So, I'm not having a double standard here, I am just prioritising my baby's wellbeing over people's feelings. 

- I am not trying to take Christmas away from him. I haven't grown up celebrating Christmas but I started celebrating it 3 years before I met him. I am planning on making Christmas nice, relaxing and homely and I would love for him to be involved in creating traditions - I'm not dictating everything. I was hoping this would be a joint endeavour. 

- I have tried to talk to him about it again and also told him that saying that spending time with only me and baby was 'miserable' for Christmas was an unloving thing to say and did make me question if his love for me had changed, but he just doubled down that it would indeed be miserable. His love hadn't changed for me and he does everything in life for me and wants me to compromise. He also said I was weird and crazy for wanting to have our own Christmas at home.

Like this man doesn‚Äôt even like me and I don‚Äôt want him to die alone, but you, his son, dgaf? I interrupted and said I‚Äôll stay the night and my mom was like no, why would you stay his son should stay. If he has visitors or church folk, we need someone who knows them to facilitate. She said she doesn‚Äôt want me to be the only if he DOES happen to pass in the middle of the night. Which I also get. 

Anyway I talk to much and I started taking my moms side and my dad snapped at us and said some things to my mom I didn‚Äôt really understand and now the car ride back home has been silent.  

I don‚Äôt want my grandpa to die alone. Even typing that sentence out loud I am swallowing tears so my parents don‚Äôt hear. How do I convince my dad without fucking him up mentally that his father CANNOT die alone? And AITA? 

Tldr- dads dad will be dead in less than a few days and he wants to go home to sleep but mom wants him to stay in the hospital ",0.0,0.11123339086771011,0,1
