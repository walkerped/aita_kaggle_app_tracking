0,1fvgl5u,AITA for agreeing with my mom that it’s kind of pathetic my wife can’t cook,"I (28M) have been married to my wife (31F) for about a year. Overall, things are great, but one thing that’s been bugging me is that my wife doesn’t know how to cook—at all. I’ve always been the one to handle meals, which I was fine with in the beginning because I enjoy cooking. But over time, it’s started to wear on me, especially when I come home after a long day at work and still have to cook dinner while she relaxes. She refuses to cook and claims there is nothing wrong with not being able to cook. It’s been an ongoing issue between us. I have been trying to teach her but she is really bad at it. Many conversation about this 

The other night, my mom (56F) came over for dinner. As usual, I was in the kitchen preparing everything, and my wife was sitting with my mom. At one point, my mom offered to help, and I asked if she could make the gravy or cut some fruit .  My wife was standing around in the kitchen when my mom handed her a knife and asked her to cut some fruit while she handled the gravy. My wife couldn’t figure out how to hold it properly and ended up making a mess. My mom watched her fail to cut the fruit and then blurted out, “It’s honestly kind of pathetic that you don’t even know how to cut a piece of fruit at your age.” She then went behind her and started to guide her how to cut stuff like you do with a kid. My wife kinda shrugged and finished cutting her fruit with my mom guiding her  Dinner happens and I noticed my wife was not happy the whole night.

My mom left and she was pissed I didn’t defend her. That I embarrassed her by letting it happens We got into a bad argument and I told her that it is pathetic she can not even cut fruit. She is literally older than me and can’t hold a knife properly.
She told me that is not the point and I needed to defend her and it’s not her fault she is bad at cooking. I point out it is, and she is embarrassed because not being able to hold a knife properly is embarrassing for an adult 


My wife thinks I am a huge jerk

Edit: I can not keep up, over 2000 comments and I have things to do. If you have an info may already be answer in a previous comment 


So update: I definitely think this is weaponized incompetence, I will suggest marriage counseling and cooking classes. If things don't change I will be out. I will make this very clear

1,1fvgbf4,AITA for Ignoring my friend over food? ,"I, (13F) have a friend (13M) who we will call ""Mateo"" for this story, has an overly BIG appetite.

Since the 7th grade, when I had a huge crush on him. In 4th period He always asked for snacks, which I had no problem doing. Even to the point I didn't eat to make sure he had snacks. 
This carried on to the beginning of 8th grade until now. 

I noticed he actually NEVER talked to me to talk to me. He only talked to me for food. Every morning when he saw me he never says ""Hello"", ""Good morning"", ""How are you?"". It's always ""where are my snacks."" I didn't think much until last week. I owed a guy in our grade a bowl of ramen (context I'm the only student in the 8th grade who has access to the schools microwaves because of some health issues, so many people ask me to heat up lunches for them, including my friend Mateo) 

Unfortunately that same day I told Mateo I had no snacks for him (which I technically didn't lie) meaning when he saw me giving the ramen to the guy I owed it to, he had this raging petty fit. 

I was eating lunch with my friend and one of his friends came to our table to tell me Mateo called me. I went to his table stupidly thinking he wanted me to sit with them but, he started spewing complaints calling me a backstabber and a liar for not giving him snacks even though I give him the most snacks out of all my friends, so much so my own friends have been getting mad about my favoritism. 

I was shocked he did that, and talked to my friend about it. She told me I should fight back, and I planned to but it didn't work. Instead he did something to make me feel guilty into giving him food.  

My friends kept on telling me to fight back and I finally built up the courage too, but now this is where I'm wondering if I'm TA

The next day in our P.E class he was complaining about food and my friend walked up and asked why Mateo was so angry and I said ""Because he's a big back and expects me to give him snacks all the time""
It slipped, But I'm still happy I said it, that was the first hint he did not get. 

The same day at lunch I went to his friend (the one that told me to come to his table), gave her crackers and hugged her. Mateo called me, I ignored. However he still didn't get this message. 

The next day the same friend I gave crackers tapped me on the shoulder to tell me Mateo was calling me, I looked at him and he was smiling. I knew he wanted snacks. I looked him in the eye, looked the other direction. 
At lunch I was walking and he called me to either hug me or waved at me, I looked at him, kept on walking which shocked him. 

Thinking back, I felt like that was a dramatic approach, I felt like I could have handled it better. Especially knowing Mateo is a sensitive person. 
I could have given him the wrong impression 

I texted him to apologize but I'm not sure if I should. All my friends say he uses me for food, I usually would say ""He's not, I know he's not."" But I'm second guessing that claim.

I know this is long but I really need to know AITA?

2,1fvg545,AITA for Complaining to my Best Friend about her Boyfriend being a Jerk?,"I (13F) am in 10th grade. My best friend (14F) and her boyfriend (15F) are both in my school. I’m going to call my bsf Amy and her bf John. At the start of my freshman year, this girl, Sue used to go to middle school with John before going to high school and she told me that John inappropriately touched his ex girlfriend that also went to their middle school, and that he had done a lot of other bad things, which quickly spread through the school. From what I had observed from his behavior I believed her, especially since another girl in our school said that he also tried to touch her w/o her consent. Anyways, when they started dating, I made it clear I didn’t like him. I had one class with him that Amy wasn’t in. He knew I didn’t like him, so he tended to try to make me mad and uncomfortable. One time in class, I had to sit with him and his friend, which prompted him and his friend to make a bunch of inappropriate jokes with each other despite me clearly being uncomfortable and asking him to stop. Looking back, the jokes weren’t really that bad and I overreacted. But he doesn’t make these jokes when Amy is there, and a guy who has been accused of inappropriate touching isn’t really the type of person that I would love to hear those type of jokes from. Over the course of freshman year, he has kept doing things like this, including calling my braids “dreads”, which struck a nerve because I do my braids myself and I’ve always been slightly insecure about my hair. He also drew a comic that had his friend saying that he wanted me to fuck him, and another where it was me but he called my hair “ugly ass dreads”. Each time I complained to Amy about it, but she tends to be very passive about the whole thing. I mostly just do it to vent because at the moment it hurts a bit, but I get over it fairly quickly. This year, I decided to wear my hair natural, which makes it into like a semi-Afro but just not round. I was very insecure about this, but throughout the day I kept getting compliments. However I really just didn’t want to have to deal with someone that Amy values saying something about my hair. Which is exactly what he did. So I got slightly pissed and just told him not to comment on my hair considering that he has made slightly racist comments on my hair before and I didn’t want to deal with that. When I told my friend she got like very frustrated and I didn’t really know what to say because I feel like it’s not that bad for me to just rant a little bit about it, but I get that it’s might feel impossible for her considering that both me and John complain about each other (he’s told her that I’m an annoying bitch a lot it think). Thing is, I don’t really complain that much about it, unless it hits a nerve at the moment. I feel like sometimes I even get along with him when he isn’t hitting nerves. Also I was ranting in a group chat, not to her only.

Am I the asshole for telling her when he says stuff like that it hits nerves?

3,1fvg0lb,AITA by leaving my sister with my dad during a concert?,"I (17F) went to my favourite band's concerts last night. Originally, I was supposed to just go with my dad since he didn't trust me going alone. However, I invited my sister (13F) to come along since she liked some of their songs too, so I wanted her to experience it as well, but it was on a weekday so she was abit hesitant. Eventually she agreed, so we got a ticket for her as well. The problem was that since we bought 2 tickets together and 1 separately, we got separate tickets. Our seat numbers ended up being 48, 49 and 55 in the same row.

My dad told me he wanted me and my sister to sit together, and at first I agreed but then asked him if I could have the more center view if his presumed seat (55) had it. He agreed but I think he didn't register that my sister and I would be separated.

At the concert, we were finding our seats and I noticed the separate seat (55) had a better view of the band. It was better since it had more of a centre view and I could see the band clearer. FYI, the section we were in ended up being split into three, so I got the edge of the middle section with the number 55 while my sister and my dad got the left section. I got excited and asked my sister if it was fine if I sat alone in that seat, and she said it was. I asked my dad and he also agreed, but then when I went to seat he started telling me to move back. After seeing the view I had, admittedly I felt a little bit selfish and wanted to stay, so I didn't. He then texted me saying that my sister was really sad about not sitting with me, so then I texted my sister afterwards to ask her if she wanted to sit with me. I would gladly move back if she said yes, we're quite close and have a good sibling relationship.

She then said not to move back and that it was okay, and to just send her any videos from the seat I was in. I agreed and told my dad I wouldn't move back, and he stopped protesting. After the concert was over, my sister and I gushed about how good it was and how it was super fun. Later on that night when my mom (41F) found out about the seating, she scolded me saying that I was really insensitive and selfish for not staying with my sister, and that my sister only went to company me to the concert. She said that I should know better, that obviously my sister wouldn't say anything because she wanted to make me happy and that she was too much of a people pleaser to say anything. I got upset and asked my sister if she was mad/upset that I didn't sit with her, and she said no again, and that it was a concert.

Today, my dad also commented on it saying I was really mean and selfish for doing that, and that you could tell by her face that my sister was disappointed. I feel really guilty now, and admittedly feel really selfish for not sitting with my sister to get a slightly better view, but my sister said she was fine and still enjoyed the concert. I feel really conflicted, AITA for leaving the seat beside my sister?

4,1fvfwn1,AITA for not paying my sister’s rent because she only works 30 hours a week?,"So, I (24M) have been working hard at my full-time job, grinding away to save up for a house and my future. My sister (22F), on the other hand, works a whopping 30 hours a week at a coffee shop, and somehow thinks she’s entitled to me covering her rent because she’s “stressed” and “barely making ends meet.”

She lives in this fancy apartment she clearly can’t afford, spends her weekends partying, buying overpriced lattes, and going on “mental health retreats.” She asked me to pay her rent for this month, and I refused because, hello? Not my problem. She got mad and called me selfish, saying that “family helps family.”

AITA for saying no to bailing her out, or should I just let her sink?

Update: I took the advice from everyone here and phoned my sister and parents to have a serious conversation just minutes ago.

I offered to help my sister budget and get her finances on track, but she refused. She insists that she has it all under control and is just waiting on her OnlyFans payment to come in this month. Of all people I didn’t expect my sister to be selling herself online, it makes me sick to my stomach. It turns out she hasn’t even been working at all and quit her job a few months ago. I’m starting to feel guilty, and am considering helping her out until she finds another way to earn a living that’s not so exploitative. Does this change things or should I stay true to my initial word? 

After talking to my parents, they apologized for pinning it all on me and mentioned they’ve been dealing with some marriage issues and have had some recent health problems arise they hadn’t told me about yet.

5,1fvfkmf,AITA for avoiding conversations or advice from my SO?,"I’m a 24F living with my BF (31M). We’ve been together for 3 years. He’s always been argumentative and loves debating, even over small things. I used to engage more, but lately, I just want peace at home. We ""debate"" about trivial things like random facts (for example, wat is more common side effect of antibiotics is diarrhea or constipation :D). Quet often I am right and can prove it with a quick google search, but it feels like i am the only one who has to put effot to prove my ""truth"", which gets exhausting, while I wish to be given benefit of a doubt... that I might be correct.  

I’ve started avoiding these debates and just agreeing with him to end them. He noticed and called me out, saying I’m just trying to shut down conversations. The problem is, he often brings up these debates at the worst times—right before I’m leaving, when I’m sick, or after we already had a  negative interaction. He does this with friends too. I’ve seen people directly ask him to stop talking, but he’ll just keep going. He has arguments for a sport, and without assumption that he might  be wrong that there is something  to learn from others, and I our friends find it frustrating  but have learned to sort of laugh it off... living with it is difrent  tho...

Another issue is the constant unsolicited advice. I’m a designer working in animation and 3D modeling etc... and when AI tools became popular, he kept suggesting things he saw on TikTok, saying I should use them, or making fun of my opinions on how AI violates copyright but he would push even when I said that it make ms me uncomfortable and he has no experience  in that feald at all.


What frustrates me the most that after i am already upset he will bring up another topic or give me another advice like how to store my bike for winter, or how we should plan a trip, or how i should write a complaint bcuz i worked over time, or just something  random... when I would just like to recover a bit after  the last one. When I say something  he often questions it and I have to prove everything  I say...  yet he's prof is "" bcuz that's true)

If I need advice I'll ask for it, it makes me not wanna share anything about my life, becouse instead of support I am always told how to live my life.... even on things that have little to do with him.

I know I’ve been avoidant lately watever he brings up... just makes me wanna run away. 

He is upset and says that it seems that I don't want to interact at all... 
because I’m tired of arguing over unimportant things, or hearing advice i never asked for especially when I’m stressed or sick or about to leave the hose?

 AITA for shutting down these conversations trying to protect my peace at home? I don't have these issues with other people...
 He also had ADHD and ODD diagnoses as a kid, but not as an adult,  which makes me wonder if I should be more understanding.

I’m a designer working in animation and 3D modeling etc... and when AI tools became popular, he kept suggesting things he saw on TikTok, saying I should use them, or making fun of my opinions on how AI violates copyright but he would push even when I said that it make ms me uncomfortable and he has no experience  in that feald at all.


What frustrates me the most that after i am already upset he will bring up another topic or give me another advice like how to store my bike for winter, or how we should plan a trip, or how i should write a complaint bcuz i worked over time, or just something  random... when I would just like to recover a bit after  the last one. When I say something  he often questions it and I have to prove everything  I say...  yet he's prof is "" bcuz that's true)

If I need advice I'll ask for it, it makes me not wanna share anything about my life, becouse instead of support I am always told how to live my life.... even on things that have little to do with him.

I know I’ve been avoidant lately watever he brings up... just makes me wanna run away. 

He is upset and says that it seems that I don't want to interact at all... 
because I’m tired of arguing over unimportant things, or hearing advice i never asked for especially when I’m stressed or sick or about to leave the hose?

 AITA for shutting down these conversations trying to protect my peace at home? I don't have these issues with other people...
 He also had ADHD and ODD diagnoses as a kid, but not as an adult,  which makes me wonder if I should be more understanding.

6,1fvfgnj,AITA for wanting my husbands grandpa to leave me alone?,"I feel like the answer is yes but I need advice on how to handle. 

My husband and I have been living together for 11 years. We have a 10 year old and baby on the way. 3 years ago we had his grandpa come stay with us because his wife died and my husband didn’t want him to be alone. I usually work a lot and just have casual conversation with his grandpa. How was your day, how are you feeling? Whatever. He always has something very negative to say so I try to keep it short. I asked my husband about this and he just says he has always been negative like that and his mom always complained about it when he lived with her. 

Now I have been put on bedrest for the remainder of my pregnancy, we lost 6 babies trying to have this one and I’m having some issues so my doctor wants me taking it easy. Major issue I’m having is thunderclap headaches coming on as soon as I sleep. It makes me throw up all night, on top of peeing every two hours when I can sleep. I am getting no rest. Now that I am on leave I can finally take a nap when needed. 

Previous to grandpa moving in I always listened to podcasts or music on our speakers when doing housework or cooking. Now I have to use headphones which would be fine but has started my aggravation.

If I’m cooking or cleaning he will talk to me and wave me down until I have to wash my hands, pause my phone and take my headphones out. He will then ask how I feel about the last news article that ran even though I obviously have no clue what just happened or he will just try to talk about the weather.

He reports everything he does to me. Going to get the mail? Going to sit on the porch? Leaving the house? Even if I am asleep he will wake me up to tell me he is going outside.

If I start cleaning and taking my laundry to the laundry room he will literally go start his own laundry. One time he put 3 shirts in the washer just to beat me too it. 

If he drives to town he can be back home 10 minutes and tell me he needs me to go run an errand for him.

He also refuses to learn how to use our Roku remote. They have like what, 10 buttons? If he needs the volume changed, channel changed or even the TV turned off he will come get me, wake me up, or pound on my bedroom door if I’m in the middle of a shower until I get up to respond to him. Keep in mind, he has a cell phone he uses ALL DAY. I have never seen anyone, not even a teenage girl, have as many phone conversations as this man does all day everyday. You can use a phone but not a remote I have tried to show you how to use for 3 years?


I am irritated and starting to wonder if he will be like this when the baby arrives. During naps? During nursing?

8,1fvf372,WIBTAH if I refuse to go to my roommate’s wedding?,"Hi everyone, would really appreciate some advice. My roommate (33M, we can call him Jason) is getting married this year. Jason invited me, but I (33M) am on the fence about going due to how his engagement party went.

Earlier in the year, they had their engagement party and I was invited solo. I asked Jason if I could bring a +1, wanted to come with my boyfriend (36M, lets call him Andy) to ease the social anxiety, I’m very introverted and I only knew 1 other person who was going. He said there was “limited space”. I thought that was reasonable, at the time he’d never even met Andy, so I went solo. 

When I got there, almost all his other friends had their significant others with them. I was a little taken aback, but assumed that everyone must have known each other for a long time and that everyone had gotten their own invites. I just talked to the 1 other person I knew and his wife. I tried to say hi to Jason’s parents since we had not met yet, but his mom just looked at me, then started talking to the other guy next to me. I thought “maybe there was a language barrier” but then she started speaking to the other guy in English… I just brushed it off.

Later on, I found out that Jason’s other friends got an invite with a +1 to the engagement party. I tried not to take it the wrong way, but something just feels a little off. I got the invite to Jason’s wedding but unfortunately there’s no +1 on the invite again. I talked to the one other guy I know, but he said that his came with a guest invite. 

I want to bring this up with Jason, but I’m not sure how to approach it. I feel like it’s not my place to say who gets invited to someone else’s wedding, but I know there will be lots of music and couples dancing and I really don’t wanna be the only one sitting at the table alone while everyone else is enjoying the time with their partners... again. It feels SUPER isolating. Andy is my whole heart, my rock, my soulmate. He knows how to calm me down when I get anxious in these settings… I want him there, even if it’s just sitting at the table with me.

For context:
-Jason has met Andy now and they get along well. 
-Jason and I have been friends for a few years, even before he met his fiancée 
-I have been dating Andy for as long as Jason has been dating his fiancée (30F). 
-Both Jason, his fiancée, and their families are very religious and south asian (don’t wanna elaborate further for anonymity). Andy and I are agnostic and black.
-Neither Jason nor his fiancée have ever demonstrated racist or homophobic behaviors in the past. We have really never had an issue.

I feel like if I ask and he says “no”, then I should probably decline the invitation, but I don’t want to create unnecessary drama with my roomie. Anyone have any advice on how I should approach Jason? Am I making a big deal over nothing? WIBTAH if I decline the invitation because I can’t go with my partner?

9,1fveqfc,AITAH for going to Vegas while my best friend is in the hospital,"Me, 23F, and my best friend, 23F, have lived together for four years throughout college. Our relationship has been somewhat codependent; we were extremely close, sharing the same friends and doing everything together. While this closeness sometimes was toxic, we remained best friends.

This year, we aren’t living together, but we’re still in the same city. We don’t see each other as often, but our friendship remains strong. I genuinely believe that living separately has been beneficial for my mental health. Sharing a room had become taxing as our relationship grew more codependent and occasionally toxic.

Fast forward. Two days ago my bffs dad suffered a terrible stroke, his second stroke. I was with her when the first one happened, about two years ago, right before her birthday. I dropped everything to stay with her and comfort her before she flew home to be with him. I vividly remember how devastated she was then; two of our friends posted pictures of sunsets and went out to the bars the night before her birthday. She found it insensitive that they were out having fun while she was at home, worried about her dad. I don’t know if it was more about her birthday or just the circumstances surrounding the stroke that upset her. That weekend, I stayed home, consumed with anxiety, looking up stroke statistics and feeling helpless. I tend to be empathetic to a fault, deeply feeling my friends' emotions, especially hers. It made me feel stagnant and sad, as if I couldn’t do anything meaningful.

This time the stroke is worse. He had to undergo brain surgery, and I don’t know how he’s doing, but doesnt look good. They’re really close, and I’ve been the only friend she’s texting with about this. I’ve tried to ask questions, support, and express how sorry I am. I genuinely want to be there for her, but I often find myself at a loss for the right words.

Now, I have a trip to Vegas that I’ve had planning for a while, for my friend's uncle’s birthday. It’s a Thursday night to Sunday morning trip, involving her whole family. We have tickets for concerts and plans to go out each night.

My bff flew home the night her dad had the stroke, and will be in her hometown until Sunday or longer. I can’t physically be there for her, which has left me anxious about whether I should still go on this trip. I worry that I’ll be in a crowded place when she calls to share bad news, and I don’t want to be insensitive. Last time, she was very upset with our other friends for going out while she was dealing with this. I fear she might feel the same way about me and question my loyalty.

I’ve thought about canceling the trip, but everyone has advised me not to. I’m trying to tell myself that she would want me to go, but I know her well enough to understand how this could hurt her feelings. My flight leaves tonight, and I’m scared of how this might affect our friendship. I even considered leaving some treats in her room before I go, hoping it might brighten her day when she gets home.

10,1fveh1w,AITA for telling my cousin she doesn’t have to go to college?,"My (23F) entire family has gone to college and most of them honestly look down on people without degrees.

My little cousin (16F) looks up to me and recently called me to confess that she didn’t know if college was right for her. My cousin has always struggled in school, it’s just not her thing. She’s hasn’t looked at any schools and doesn’t know what she’d major in. She always gets quiet when people ask her about college. 

The thing is she’s super good at doing hair. She’s made over 30k just this year from doing hair (and this is just from doing it part time during the summer or on weekends). She’s also gained quite a following on social media on her hair page and has even had celebrities reach out to her to do their hair. If she did this full time after high school she could easily be making 70k or more a year right out of high school. 

I told her that if she was already having doubts about school, that she shouldn’t go to college right away and she could pursue being a licensed hairstylist. Plus she could always go back to school if she doesn’t like being a full time stylist. Her eyes lit up when I said this and I helped her look up how to get licensed and she seemed really excited about the idea.

Well she ended up telling her parents what I said and they’re incredibly angry at me. They’re calling me an ahole for telling their daughter not to go to school and think she’ll be the black sheep of the family for being the only one not to go to college. They also told me I’m a horrible role model and asked why I am trying to sabotage her. I’m also currently getting calls from other family members telling me I’m horrible and need to tell my cousin to go to college.

A few months ago I made a tiktok post about brothers who aren’t blood related, before I even made the post I messaged the gc for everybody’s consent about posting the video. About 6 of em said yes I can post it and sent me a picture of them to add into it. I waited for about a month or 2 to get everyone’s consent, HOWEVER between those days one of the guys S (16M) wouldn’t stop pestering me about posting the video to the point I got annoyed and posted the video with the pictures of the 6 that gave me consent.

About 2 weeks later after posting the video I get a dm from a girl L (15-16f) having a go at me for posting S and calling him a brother. I tried to explain to her about the fact I got his permission but she wasn’t having it and started insulting me so I blocked her.

2 weeks ago I posted a picture of a new outfit I brought and I rung my friend G (17m) to see what he thought of the outfit he was out with L and I didn’t know so he asked L to come over and give her opinion where she made the comment “who that’s a cute outfit but who’s that?” G proceeded to tell her who it was and she did a 180 and proceeded to insult me 


Moving to today L got added into the gc under the conditions that she isn’t allowed to start drama. One of the girls in the gc sent a picture of a cat and I commented about how cute the cat was. Then one of the guys agreed with me and we all started chatting until L popped up and started calling me a “pick me” for talking to the guy about the cat and brung up the tiktok video again, I ignored her which seemed to get her annoyed which then she started off dissing my looks and complaining about how I post videos of motorbikes when I don’t have one (I do have a bike). 

One of the guys H (17m) stepped in and told her to stop cuz we told her not to start drama, L then started to bash him, commenting on his looks and just being blatantly rude. I defended H and she wasn’t happy about that and decided to remove me from the group. I got added back and I proceeded to remove her. 
That’s when 1 of the other girls, S and one of the guys started bashing me and calling me an AH and to “give her another chance” but I ignored em 

I don’t think I’m in the wrong but when I told others they said I shouldn’t have removed her and leave her to go at it. I just want other peoples opinion, so AITA?

Then one of the guys agreed with me and we all started chatting until L popped up and started calling me a “pick me” for talking to the guy about the cat and brung up the tiktok video again, I ignored her which seemed to get her annoyed which then she started off dissing my looks and complaining about how I post videos of motorbikes when I don’t have one (I do have a bike). 

One of the guys H (17m) stepped in and told her to stop cuz we told her not to start drama, L then started to bash him, commenting on his looks and just being blatantly rude. I defended H and she wasn’t happy about that and decided to remove me from the group. I got added back and I proceeded to remove her. 
That’s when 1 of the other girls, S and one of the guys started bashing me and calling me an AH and to “give her another chance” but I ignored em 

I don’t think I’m in the wrong but when I told others they said I shouldn’t have removed her and leave her to go at it. I just want other peoples opinion, so AITA?

TLDR: I removed a girl from the gc because she started causing drama when told not to due to a past TikTok I made about calling her bf a brother and guys in the gc with their permission.",2.0,0.0633597,0,0
12,1fve30c,AITA for refusing to get involved with cousin's drama?,"I (38F) have a huge family and we are all close. As expected, we have occasional disagreements, but very few permanently strained relationships. 

My cousins Lea (58) and Alan (61) are siblings who don't get along with each other. They ""play nice"" at family gatherings but otherwise have a strained relationship. I don't get involved in this and spend time with them equally.

This Saturday we are having a family dinner to celebrate the Jewish new year (I know it's on Thursday, we do this so we can all be together). In the past, Lea has tried and failed when it comes to bringing things for family dinners. For example, when we asked her to bring dessert for Thanksgiving once she didn't know to put an order in at a bakery in advance, so she brought a table talk apple pie. For this dinner, she offered to bring wine. Earlier today she asked me if I had a wine preference, which is a weird question to ask me because I have a three month old baby and am breastfeeding. I told her as such, so she told me she picked a variety. When I asked out of curiosity how many bottles she bought, she said she only bought one because not too many people will be drinking. I reminded her that four people will be drinking and suggested she get two more bottles.

This is where I get pissed/might be the asshole...she tells me at this point she already left the wine store and maybe Alan will bring some. I suggested she confirm that with him. She said she won't ask him because he only says no to her and asked me to ask him. I snapped and  told her she's too old to be acting like this and I'm not getting involved between them. Five minutes later she texted back saying not to worry about it and that she will show up with her bottle of wine and some food.

13,1fvdzdv,WIBTA if I asked my roommate to start staying home more often?,"This is a bad internal conflict I've been having with myself for a while now. 

I [24F] have been living with Samantha [28F] for about 6 months. When we moved in together, she brought her 2 cats, and I brought mine. Shortly after we signed our lease, she convinced me to be okay with her adopting an 8 week old kitten. Obviously, as kittens are, she was *super* energetic, which led to my roommate leaving the house constantly because she was too overwhelmed by her, or locking her in our guest bedroom all day. Right now, the kitten is bonded to me instead of her because I stayed home to take care of her.

Now, she is gone for 14-17 hours a day. She works from 7:30am until about 4pm, and then goes over to her mother's house until right before I get home from work at 10:30, or later depending on the day. Due to this, she never feeds any of her cats, never scoops any litter boxes, never plays with them or cuddles them, etc. She's pretty much just here to sleep. So all the responsibility for all 5 cats has fallen onto me and honestly, I'm extremely overwhelmed. Her cats are stressed and keep fighting with mine and making their lives miserable, I'm running out of cat food really, really quickly for my girls because I keep having to feed hers when she won't buy them food. I'm scooping every litter box by myself without any help from her. I feel terrible for her cats because they're just stressed and wanting attention but it's overstimulating to me when her cats try to lay on me (I'm on the spectrum, and having something that heavy lay on my chest makes me feel anxious. My cats know not to do that and just sit next to me or lean on me).

I will also admit that, while I know it's selfish, the help with cleaning and caring for them would also be nice. I have a few physical disabilities that make standing or moving around for a long time range from painful to impossible because I will faint on occasion.

I want to ask my roommate to start actually coming home after work and taking care of her cats, but I know that it's not my place to do so. I know that I can't control her or what she does, and I feel like it would be an AH move for me to try to by asking her to stay home more often, especially since it would be for my own benefit primarily.

 I posted this  about 5 days ago and I deleted it as my husband pointed out I left out a lot of crucial information so instead of editing and all that I deleted it and I'm making a new post  


So here's what you need to know my husband and I  (29 M&F)  are doing our vows a few weeks shy of our 10th anniversary next year we're going to do an actual ceremony and reception as we just went down to the courthouse and got married the first time it's going to be small and intimate in our closest friends and family 


Yes, I absolutely could walk myself down the aisle but 10 years ago I got into a car accident that completely crushed my left foot,  I will be in a walking boot for the rest of my life and I've learned to be okay with that. I can walk with other shoes but I need either a walker or a cane to help me or if someone offers their arm to walk with me,  I've had surgery making it permanently stabilized so it doesn't bend, so I do not have the full range of my ankle or foot. Why this is relevant - my grandmother hand crocheted a pair of lace slippers for my  each of female cousins and me ( she made crocheted boutonnieres for my brothers and male cousins) for when we got married that way if she passed we could have a piece of her with us, (unfortunately she had passed in 2021). 10 years ago I couldn't even walk,  I got married in a wheelchair with my foot had sock on as anything other that that caused excruciating pain. But after years of PT I'm okay with things touching my foot. I plan on wearing my pair of lace slippers which is why I would like someone to walk down with me, it's not at all about giving me away. it's for support so I don't have to use a cane or walker. 



I've been thinking about the whole ""who is walking me down part"" and I'm very much NC and LC with my family I have spoken to my mother and my brother since 2019 and I haven't seen my father for over six months besides waving at him from the car at a red light, he's only met my 1-year-old daughter once and he has been around my 8-year-old son a handful of times. 



I thought about asking my FIL, but my husband's family is just now realizing we don't speak to my side. I was thinking about asking my grandpa but frankly, I'm not even sure he's going to be here next October as his health is declining


Here's where I might be the A-hole because I'm thinking about asking my best friend since middle school, my kids call her auntie and I even used her middle name as part of my daughter's name.  she supported me through my darkest times and was there through every part of my recovery. She celebrated every good moment since we've been friends. 

I know it'll hurt my family's feelings (especially my father's)  by not asking him as my father's side has always been more traditional and I know he's expecting me to ask but would I be the A-hole if I didn't ask him to walk with me?

I've recently started therapy, DIT for anyone interested because I wanted to be able to talk through my past with someone and maybe get over some issues I have with not speaking about myself in healthy ways (I have people in my life that don't know my actual name)

And today, aswell as speaking about food issues, we spoke about my issues in regards to that and my family. My family situation has always been the hardest thing for me growing up because I haven't been able to talk about alot of things with my parents without them taking it lile a personal attack on them, my father more than my mother. I'm sure he's narcissistic but definitely have issues regarding him the most. 

But my therapist brought up that my comfort foods might be more comfort foods because I don't have to compromise my likes for anyone. They're small enough for just me and no one else will eat it so that's why I find comfort in going back to eat these items, even though I know they aren't good for me. 

All my life I've compromised on food for my brother who is a picky eater, my parents who don't like the same things I like, my partner who is a picky eater and his parents who don't like certain foods or seasonings. The therapist said that it might be because of this that I don't tend to eat what my body wants because I'm so used to compromising and going with what other people wany, creating an unhealthy relationship with food. 

I loved this explanation and tried to talk about it with my father, who immeditely took offense to this, saying I never compromised with food for anyone and I'm just lying to the therapist to make it sound like I had a bad childhood. He then called me a bitch and said he didn't want to talk to me again. 

I don't feel like what I said was wrong, I didn't blame anyone, just that I'm not going to compromise my likes for anyone else anymore, I didn't even get to anything else because he wouldn't let me get past the whole 'compromising with my brother' part.

16,1fvb9gl,AITA for delaying my friend so she has to buy expensive tickets?,"A friend of mine invited me to fly to Japan with her for a conference she’s presenting at. She’ll be presenting for her school, so her schoolmates and some teachers will be there with her—she only invited me so that we could have a side trip together once the conference is over. 

They are supposed to fly to Japan on October 15, and she only invited me to come a month before, so it was pretty spontaneous. My parents support me financially as I’m still a student, so it really depended on them if I could go with her or not.

She didn’t want to book her plane tickets + accommodations as she was waiting to see if I could come with her or not. I told her early on that she should just assume that I’m not coming with her and book her flight and hotel, but she insisted on waiting for my parents’ decision.

It was pretty difficult for me to convince my parents to let me go as it was quite spontaneous, so I couldn’t give her a straight answer since my parents weren’t giving me one as well. I told her multiple times to assume that I wasn’t going with her, but she would always insist on waiting for me.

Then yesterday, she suddenly messaged me and told me to forget about coming with her. She said that if it was taking so long for my parents to make a decision, then it was already pretty clear what the answer was. She also expressed that I should’ve gave her an answer early on so that she could’ve gotten cheaper prices for her plane tickets accommodation. Even though she told me not to worry about it, I could tell that she was really annoyed about it. I apologized multiple times, but she’s been ignoring me ever since then.

I understand that the reason why she didn’t want to book her plane tickets + accommodation early on was because they would change if I were to come with her, but I think it’s pretty unfair that she’s taking her frustrations out on me when I told her multiple times that she should assume that I wasn’t going to come with her. I’m not saying that she shouldn’t be annoyed, as she has every right to be, but I think it’s petty that she’s ignoring me and is obviously pissed at me when it was her decision to postpone purchasing her tickets + accommodation. 

I’m honestly not quite sure how to feel about this situation. If anything, I feel hurt that she’s treating me this way without considering what I’m feeling. She’s supposed to be my “best friend”, but she ghosts me for months then chats me out of the blue once in a while.

18,1fvajsr,AITA for not going to my cousin's wedding?,"**Background/Context:**  
My cousin, who is in his late 20s, is about four years older than me. Growing up, he would visit my household pretty frequently usually arriving late at night, sometimes after 2 AM. He’d crash on our couch, leave early the next morning, and that was about it. He was involved in a sport, and would come to my city 1-2 times a year for competitions. Even though I’d try to get to know him by going to some of his practices and competitions, I never felt like we were close.

The visits often disrupted my family because he and his family would arrive whenever convenient for them, sometimes bringing friends along for free lodging. He invited me to his college graduation, but I didn’t attend. I also didn’t feel inclined to invite him to my own university graduation.

Now, he’s getting married this month, and I received an invitation to the wedding. I’ve decided not to attend because, frankly, I don’t feel like I know him. Our interactions are always brief, like five minutes per visit, where he calls me “buddy” — even now, in my mid-20s, he still calls me that.

I’m skipping my cousin’s wedding because we’ve never been close, but my grandmother thinks I should go. AITA?",No A-holes here,2024-10-03,"AITA for not going to my cousin's wedding? **Background/Context:**  
My cousin, who is in his late 20s, is about four years older than me. Growing up, he would visit my household pretty frequently usually arriving late at night, sometimes after 2 AM. He’d crash on our couch, leave early the next morning, and that was about it. He was involved in a sport, and would come to my city 1-2 times a year for competitions. Even though I’d try to get to know him by going to some of his practices and competitions, I never felt like we were close.

The visits often disrupted my family because he and his family would arrive whenever convenient for them, sometimes bringing friends along for free lodging. He invited me to his college graduation, but I didn’t attend. I also didn’t feel inclined to invite him to my own university graduation.

Now, he’s getting married this month, and I received an invitation to the wedding. I’ve decided not to attend because, frankly, I don’t feel like I know him. Our interactions are always brief, like five minutes per visit, where he calls me “buddy” — even now, in my mid-20s, he still calls me that.

My grandmother is upset that I’m skipping his wedding, but I don’t see the point in going to the wedding of someone I don’t feel connected to.

19,1fvahm0,AITA for asking this person to stop vaping in a restaurant?,"Last evening, my wife and I went to a local fast food tex mex restaurant.  There is seating inside, and then there is a portion of the building that was added, has solid walls, but they open the windows and call it a ""porch"" (but it's not really a porch, just a section that opens up the windows).  The whole area seats about 30 people. There was only 1 of the 4 windows open.  The windows are all about 2 feet tall and 4 feet wide.

We began eating, and it was a bit crowded because it was a nice evening.  There were two ladies sitting next to us and were there before we sat down.  After they were done, they proceeded to get up, and went to go get a carry out container for the rest of their food.  One of the ladies came back, and started to package up their food, and the other lady apparently went to the restroom.  While waiting on the one that was gone longer, the other lady began to vape, and exhale all over me and my wife.  She never looked up, was looking down at her phone, but when she exhaled it all went over our table, and us.

The first time she did it, I was shocked more than anything.  I did a double take, to make sure what was happening was actually happening.  Then she did it a second time, and I looked over at her again, thinking about saying something, but decided against it, thinking surely she was about to leave.

Then she did it a third time - and I looked over at her - and said ""Excuse me, would you mind not vaping right here? We're trying to enjoy our dinner.""

She looked up at me - and told me ""Why don't you mind your own business? We're outside, and it's only water vapor. I'm allowed to vape when i'm outside.""  I responded, very kindly, that we were not outside, and my wife chirped in and said the same thing.  When I responded with that, she started to yell at me, telling me I was incredibly rude, that she could do whatever she wanted, and that I had no right to say anything to her.

Not wanting to escalate the situation any at all, I looked away, got up to go get a refill on my drink, and when I came back, my wife had gathered out stuff and was walking out.  I was fuming mad, not because of what the young lady said to me, but just the sense of ""I'm going to do whatever I want and there's not a thing you can do to stop me.""

When I say I asked her kindly, I literally was extremely kind, did not raise my voice, actively made sure I was not sounding condescendingly, and since there was an exit door literally right behind her, was hoping she'd just step out.  Instead - I was told I was rude, and to mind my own business.

The kicker - the other young lady she was with came back from the restroom wearing a covid mask.

21,1fv8r75,AITA for refusing to help my mother take care of her pets?  ,"I (20f) live with my mother (44f) and my little brother (12m). All throughout my teenage years, my mother has gotten pets, and then she gets tired of them and only does the bare minimum ( feed and give water,never cleaning enclosures or anything like that) so I have to take responsibility for them because I can’t let any animal live like that. We’ve had cats, axolotls, hamsters, guniea pigs, bunnies and mice. Once she even started breeding bunnies, and then never had the energy to take care of them because there were too many and “she didn’t have the energy” we had at least 40 bunnies in our stable. She would even forget to give them water and food some days. I ended up taking care of all of them and had NO free time. 

Okay to the point: We moved recently, to a much smaller house. I was so happy because we wouldn’t be able to fit anymore pets ( we have 2 dogs, one is mine and one is hers, 2 cats and I have a snake). But then she decided to get mice for my little brother because he loves mice. I begged her not to because he wouldn’t take care of them and I don’t want to. She promised me she would take care of them but yet again, 2 months later she stopped so now I’m taking care of them. And now, just last month, she bought 2 bunnies without even telling me. Today I told her she needs to clean their cage because there is shit everywhere and it’s genuinely unsafe for them to live in because it’s so gross. She got mad and told me to do it because I also live here so that apparently “makes them my pets too”? I refused and she got mad and told me I’m rude and ungrateful. 

So, is it unreasonable for me to refuse to even help her out with taking care of them? AITA?

Since it was a several hour long journey I tried to get comfortable and took off my shoes and my cardigan and put my cardigan on the unoccupied seat next to me and put my feet (wearing socks) on top, sitting with my back to the window. The girl in front of me then gave me this very displeased look and asked me to not put my feet on the seat as she might reclaim that seat later on in case someone else showed up with a seat reservation for the seat she had moved to. She was kind of rude about it and I was taken aback by her demeanour but did take my feet off the seat because I didn't want to be rude.

Now I'm left wondering if she was simply rude and a bit weird or if it is in fact rude and inappropriate to take off your shoes and putting your feet on a train seat and I just never realised it. I always considered this to be normal behaviour on long distance trains, thinking everyone will just try to get as comfortable as possible, so taking off your shoes and curling up on the seat or putting your feet up is normal. But she seemed so... I don't know, almost disgusted by me. I'm a very regular looking person wearing regular tidy clothes, I'm clean, I'm normal and boring.

In order to be prepared for future train rides I'm wondering if I was in the wrong assuming this was normal and should refrain from doing it in the future or if it's okay and she the one being rude.

Edit: Most people here seem to think it's gross and I will take that into consideration for future train rides so I don't make anyone uncomfortable.

What surprises me though is that there seems to be the general assumption that feet are dirty and disgusting. That's what I don't get. Why my freshly showered feet wearing clean socks for some reason are automatically disgusting but all other parts of my body, clothes and luggage are not. I've been on so many long distance trains in my life and have seen so many people take off their shoes or sleep curled up on the seats. Nothing about that ever seemed disgusting to me, there was never any unpleasant smell coming from anyone's feet and I've never witnessed anyone react negatively either to me or anyone else doing this up until the encounter I'm talking about here.

I always considered this to be normal behaviour on long distance trains, thinking everyone will just try to get as comfortable as possible, so taking off your shoes and curling up on the seat or putting your feet up is normal. But she seemed so... I don't know, almost disgusted by me. I'm a very regular looking person wearing regular tidy clothes, I'm clean, I'm normal and boring.

In order to be prepared for future train rides I'm wondering if I was in the wrong assuming this was normal and should refrain from doing it in the future or if it's okay and she the one being rude.

Edit: Most people here seem to think it's gross and I will take that into consideration for future train rides so I don't make anyone uncomfortable.

What surprises me though is that there seems to be the general assumption that feet are dirty and disgusting. That's what I don't get. Why my freshly showered feet wearing clean socks for some reason are automatically disgusting but all other parts of my body, clothes and luggage are not. I've been on so many long distance trains in my life and have seen so many people take off their shoes or sleep curled up on the seats. Nothing about that ever seemed disgusting to me, there was never any unpleasant smell coming from anyone's feet and I've never witnessed anyone react negatively either to me or anyone else doing this up until the encounter I'm talking about here. I always just viewed it as people trying their best to stay comfortable on a several hour long train ride.",1.0,1.0622789,1,1

My mom and her fiance started dating 2.5 years ago and I met them about a year ago. Mia met us then too. She got really close really fast but I (17M) didn't. Then about a month ago my mom and her fiance mentioned that they had booked a session with the wedding photographer to get pre-wedding sibling photos of me and Mia. They thought it would be so sweet to document the sibling journey and not just the couple journey. Mia got so excited when they mentioned it. She started picking out outfits and stuff. I'm not excited and I think I can see a disconnect to the way things will be. When the wedding actually happens I'll be 18. I was already going to move to my uncles house when I turn 18 because this house is cramped for all of us. Plus I don't see Mia as my sister. I don't have a plan to spend a lot of time with her or to focus on building up a really strong bond. But I think they all expect me to invest in getting really close to Mia...

When Mia wasn't in the room, and it was just mom and me, I brought up this and how she should have said something before. I told her where I stood and that I don't want to do them. Mom looked upset. She told me she thought I already really loved Mia and was excited for her to be my sister. I said no and I asked her what made her think that because I hardly spent any time with Mia. That between school and my job and friends I was busy. Mom didn't really answer.

A week later mom and her fiance started asking me to fake some enthusiasm because Mia noticed my reaction and had asked her dad if I was sad about the photos. I told them I hadn't agreed to the photos.

My mom's fiance said I was supposed to have come around. I told him I still felt the same.

Mia wanted to help me pick out clothes. I told her I'd prefer to do it alone. She looked upset but quickly started talking about all the stuff we'll do together on the wedding day because apparently I was meant to babysit her all day.

Mom and I talked some more and she asked me if I was ready to say yes because it would hurt more if I say no. I told her I really wasn't okay with it but if they won't put an end to it then I'll be forced to. Her fiance heard my reply and he was pissed about it.

29,1fv5gfa,AITAH for refusing to pay for my ex’s emergency?,"
My bf broke up with me a few weeks ago. I tried a lot to get him back but he refused and we decided to stay friends. He wasn’t a good bf all in all but I won’t delve into that. 

Now since the breakup, he has dabbled with I love you’s, cute names etc and then when I start reciprocating, pulls back and said we’re broken up so he doesn’t have to say it back. When I nagged him for clarity that if he wants me to wait I can but just tell me that he will only date me when he’s ready again, he called me annoying, that I’m forcing him etc and asked me to give him space and when he decides to date, he will let me know (and he said his options to date aren’t limited to me when he decides to).

He apologised later and said he has a lot of problems right now so just needs space. I told him he can have all the space he needs and I will support him but I can’t be his placeholder anymore so I’m done and I’m only interested in remaining friends at which point he put the blame of the breakup on me saying I’m the one who’s doing it since he clearly said he needs time (it had already been over 2 weeks).

Even after the breakup, I have helped him in a lot of ways. Writing his college SOPs, writing his job interview PPTs etc. Lately, his family has outrightly refused to help him with his college fees and applications. 

He only started earning a month ago (a job I helped him get btw, made his CV too and called for the interview) and hasn’t received his first pay yet. His deadline is soo due and he’s worried that the test results won’t be back till the deadline so he needs money ASAP. 

I earlier told him that I can try asking my parents for some if he wants but that was when we were broken up but still calling each other babe and saying I love you’s. 

Today, he is asked his parents for help and I’ll be honest they’re not good parents so he has no other avenues left. This is when he requested me to ask my mom for some money. 

I asked my mom and she said yes but said this is the first and last time because relationships get spoiled when money gets involved. We are relatively rich and my bf has promised to pay back in 3-4 days when he gets his paycheck. 

But the thing is, I want to say no. I already do a lot and my mom’s right too. I feel giving him the money once will make it a habit and besides I don’t feel comfortable when money is involved. Not to mention, I don’t want my mom to have a bad impression of him which she started getting when I told her he’s asking for money. 

It’s around 200$ and I am relatively rich so I can pay even though I’m myself going through a financial crunch at the moment. 

AITAH if I refuse him even though my mom said yes?

UPDATE : 

thank you everyone for your advice. I have decided to pay him the 200 for 3 reasons : 1. I did offer him the help 2. He does really need it 3. Clear conscience and clear slate. 

As for the latter part, he promises to pay back on the 10th. If he does, okay, goodbye. If he doesn’t, okay, goodbye. Good riddance either way. 

As for people calling me a doormat, I understand I seem that way. Not everything about our relationship was black and white but regardless I believe I have given my all to save whatever form of relationship or friendship existed between us and I realise it’s not only my job. I have done plenty and now it’s time for me to move on to someone who appreciates my efforts instead of planning out ways to get things out of me. 

I don’t know about it being a doormat but I have to start respecting myself more and setting boundaries. I never thought of the things I did for him as something he’s using me for. I just saw a person I love and wanted to make things easier for him. But I should know when to stop. Which is now. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-03,"AITAH for refusing to pay for my ex’s emergency?

30,1fv4slg,AITAH for telling my bf that he’s using me for my car? ,"Throw away account. 
Back story: when we met he had his own car (two door, turbo charged automatic) and a full time job. I had just finished studying, and started my own small business that obviously wasn’t making any profit yet. I had a small car (2.0 manual). We’ve been long distance since 2020 (been together since 2019) however we’ve always tried to make it a priority to spend time together pretty often. 

He has a child from a previous relationship and I don’t have kids. I’ve never had an issue with that. The child lives with the maternal grandparents. And the mother is barely involved. In 2020 he chose to quit his job because he was making more from his side hustle and his job was depressing him. I supported him. His family believes in employment and not entrepreneurship so he told them he was retrenched. 

Things went south… his car was repossessed and he was forced to move back home to another province. I still lived with my parents and this was during lockdown. We talked everyday. He needed cash to keep his side hustle going and my mom graciously gave him a loan. 

I decided to go back to college full time after working for a few years so money is tight. Fuel is expensive and so is vehicle maintenance. I also recently moved out of home. He’s now working full time again in a job he loves and is making decent money. He refuses to buy a car on credit (he is still owing on the other one). He  now lives and works 1 hour away from me and I generally don’t mind picking him up however last week I was unable to do so due to college commitments that I had forgotten about. I was reminded the day before and I told him immediately. He blew up at me basically saying that he contributes more to the relationship financially than I do and that I’m cancelling on him for something that won’t matter in the long run. All but saying that I don’t value our relationship as much as he does because when he was working 8 hours away he chose to come and spend time with me and not his child or his family. Claiming that I have never  sacrificed my family time for him (which I certainly have). 

This was literally the first time I said I couldn’t come to fetch him in 5 years and he threw everything in my face. AITAH for telling him that although he does contribute to my fuel when he needs to use the car, he also has to now help me pay for new tires? Everything I do is within a 15km radius and he lives 145km away from me and we often drive to far places for stuff he needs, including going to visit his child who lives about 50km from me.

This morning, I sent my friend a TikTok about “when that one friend keeps insulting you as a joke” and added, “when you mimic what I’m saying it’s kinda annoying; it’s not really insulting, but yeah.” She often mocks or mimics me in an exaggerated way, which is annoying, and when I tell her she’s overdoing it, she just says, “I’m just saying!”

She didn’t see the TikTok in the morning, and later, when I was at school, I was exhausted and ready to go home.

32,1fv4hg5,AITA for letting an elderly disabled person queue jump in front of a middle aged couple?,"AITA letting elderly disabled person queue jump? Or do English people not do this anymore?

This morning I went to the supermarket to and I saw an older gentleman (65/70) using a crutch and dragging a supermarket basket (one of those midsize ones on wheels, smaller than a trolley/cart but bigger than a hand basket). He was moving in a ‘step with crutch, stop, drag basket one step, step with crutch’ movement. He was very unsteady on his feet, but looked determined.

At the till queue, I saw he was four people behind me. The two people at the very back of the queue stepped aside to let him in front of them. I then asked the English couple standing behind me if we could let the gentleman through to go first. The man grunted and the woman looked at me, but made no movement. So I tried again “He’s disabled and on a crutch” she then replies “I’ve got a knee injury” and glares at me. So I replied, “I’m more than happy to let you in front of me too, but he’s barely able to walk”. Not all disabilities are visible, but I had seen her walking around the supermarket also and she was moving quite freely.

She started muttering under her breath (I think she called me a cow, but hey I’ve heard worse). They picked up their items from the conveyor belt and walked off muttering to a cashier about 6 or 7 lanes away. They then stood at the lift glaring at me.

I was more than happy to let the couple go in front of me, but the older gentleman was very unsteady on his feet.


AITA for letting an elderly disabled person queue jump, based on the couple’s reaction? Is it no longer a cultural norm to let disabled people be served first?

I should say this happened in Portugal but the couple were English with a London accent.

Edited to add: 
1) I offered for the couple to go in front of me - “*I’m more than happy to let you in front of me too*”. There’s a few comments that have missed this so I’m highlighting it. Yes I could have phrased it better, but the offer was definitely explicitly made. All they had to do was accept it.

2) The two people who had already let him in front of them had gestured to me to stay in the queue behind the man after the couple flounced off. 

3) I have a non-visible disability too and I had several surgeries and had to learn to walk again as a child. I still have issues walking myself sometimes. On good days I’m ok, others I’m not. This is why I was sympathetic to the older gentleman, but also why I said in my original post that not all disabilities are visible.

Further edit:
The elderly man wasn’t at the end of the queue as two other customers had already let him in front of them. He started at #5 who let him in front. Then #4 let him in front, moving him from last place to #3. The first two people to show him courtesy dropped back one place each. I was happy to drop back two places so that the couple also went in front of me. It was right that he went to the top of the queue. The cashier was distracted by another elderly customer so didn’t get the chance to intervene before myself and TWO other customers in the queue offered to the man to move up.

To those who **read** the post and saw I did offer for the couple to go in front of me, thank you. Yes, I could have phrased it better, and that I take on board.

There is a cultural difference between different countries based on a very unscientific scroll through the post and comment history of some of those commenting, so it’s been educational.

Not all disabilities are visible, but I had seen her walking around the supermarket also and she was moving quite freely.

She started muttering under her breath (I think she called me a cow, but hey I’ve heard worse). They picked up their items from the conveyor belt and walked off muttering to a cashier about 6 or 7 lanes away. They then stood at the lift glaring at me.

I was more than happy to let the couple go in front of me, but the older gentleman was very unsteady on his feet.


AITA for letting an elderly disabled person queue jump, based on the couple’s reaction? Is it no longer a cultural norm to let disabled people be served first?

I should say this happened in Portugal but the couple were English with a London accent.

Edited to add: 
1) I offered for the couple to go in front of me - “*I’m more than happy to let you in front of me too*”. There’s a few comments that have missed this so I’m highlighting it. Yes I could have phrased it better, but the offer was definitely explicitly made. All they had to do was accept it.

2) The two people who had already let him in front of them had gestured to me to stay in the queue behind the man after the couple flounced off. 

3) I have a non-visible disability too and I had several surgeries and had to learn to walk again as a child. I still have issues walking myself sometimes. On good days I’m ok, others I’m not. This is why I was sympathetic to the older gentleman, but also why I said in my original post that not all disabilities are visible.

Further edit:
The elderly man wasn’t at the end of the queue as two other customers had already let him in front of them. He started at #5 who let him in front. Then #4 let him in front, moving him from last place to #3. The first two people to show him courtesy dropped back one place each. I was happy to drop back two places so that the couple also went in front of me. It was right that he went to the top of the queue. The cashier was distracted by another elderly customer so didn’t get the chance to intervene before myself and TWO other customers in the queue offered to the man to move up.

To those who **read** the post and saw I did offer for the couple to go in front of me, thank you. Yes, I could have phrased it better, and that I take on board.

There is a cultural difference between different countries based on a very unscientific scroll through the post and comment history of some of those commenting, so it’s been educational.

34,1fv3xo9,AITA for calling my uncle an unchristian thief to his own son?,"I (25f) have lived with my bf (25m) for 3 years now. We are way too broke to consider marriage with the cost of rings and a wedding (which we want).

My mom's side of the family is very religious, so much so that my cousin (28m) got married to a pastor (28f) at 24 years old so they could move in together because otherwise that's taboo.

My mom recently wedded her new husband and my cousin and his wife were invited to the wedding. They took this opportunity to ask me when I'd get married (they weren't mean about it, but I knew they were uncomfortable at the idea of my living situation).

Here's the history: my gran died and left her thriving multi-million farm split between her son (my uncle, cousins father) and daughter (my mom). My uncle had been on the farm working in place of my grandfather who had died a few years before my gran while my mom had decided to study further and had children in 'the city'. So my uncle took exception to the fact that my mom got any of the property and threatened to sue my mom. My mom, 29 at the time while her brother was 41, was naive and broke and in mourning and didn't want this fight so she forfeited her portion of the inheritance. My uncle promptly sold the farm for a fortune and moved to the coast to retire at 45. And he paid for the extravagant marriage of my cousin and his pastor wife.

So when they asked when I'm getting married, they asked as if money couldn't be a deciding factor when I laughed it off the first time and told them I'm just to broke to get married (my uncle had also just bought them their first house after they moved out the apartment he bought for them).

So when they said money isn't a good reason as a Christian to live with my bf while we still aren't married, I gave them another answer which is I can't afford to have my mom pay for a wedding and buy property for me because my uncle has the money our grandparents wanted my mom to have and they can't use the premise of Christianity to make me feel guilty about my situation when they know my uncle threatened my mom out of her inheritance then cut contact with her until he needed her help with his bad health. They were here walking around like good Christians with unchristian skeletons in their closet and when that closet was clean, could they come pester me about my unwed life.

I know it isn't their fault my uncle is an ass, but I can tolerate the privilege some Christian people feel over others a lot more than I can tolerate the privilege of having money and pretending it isn't a factor in life.

But my mom was not happy with me, she says bygones should be bygones. My bf is not happy with me, he said their privilege is not their fault.

My wife (29F) and I have two kids together. Our oldest is 4 and our youngest is 18 months. I became the stay at home parent when our oldest was born. My brother (36M) is married to SIL (39F) and they have five kids together between the ages of 4 and 10. SIL was ""stunned"" when I became the stay at home parent vs my wife. She has a more ""traditional"" view of marriage and family and believes the mom is more important in the home than the dad and that the dad is more important as the provider. Stunned and traditional are her choice of words, just so you're aware.

So I always felt like she was more critical of me as a parent. Maybe not in clear ways before now but her attitude made me feel like she was watching closely to see if I was good enough.

The way my wife and I feed our kids is different to how my SIL and my brother feed their kids. SIL believes in 3 meals a day no matter what the age and nothing more or less. She believes that is the way it has been done for centuries and it works. My wife and I approach it differently. We feed the kids smaller, more frequent meals and snacks. Because of this I carry around lunch boxes for both my kids that have foods they eat throughout the day if we go anywhere. And at home my wife or I have stuff pre-made and ready to go. This means my kids eat little meals or snacks every three-ish hours. Not large quantities but smaller and more frequently than my nieces and nephews.

SIL thinks it's ""insanity"" and she has told me I make more work for myself and claims I'm trying to ""be different because I'm a dad doing the primary caregiving"". She told me I should practice doing things differently because in the real world this stuff won't work and preschool and school won't allow for this, which isn't true with the where we have chosen to send our kids to school. But she doesn't want to hear that. I spoke to my brother about his wife's comments on the choices my wife and I made to feed our kids and how it's not helpful or needed. He said he knows but that it's just how she is. I told him if she keeps it up she will be told to shut up, maybe or maybe not in a nicer way. He just shrugged.

I hit this limit on Friday when SIL saw me out with the kids and my dad and FIL (the three of us grocery shop together some Fridays). She brought it up out of nowhere because she saw the bag I keep the lunch boxes in. She didn't even see them eat anything but needed to say something. She told me I should practice better eating habits and I told her she should practice keeping her opinions to herself because she doesn't get a say in how my kids eat and she doesn't get to open her big mouth about it every time she sees me now. She stormed off outraged and there have been multiple texts from her and my brother since. He's mostly just telling me what she's saying but she is big mad.

She seemed nice and he specially wanted her to meet me since I'm ranked high on his friendship tier and she had several common interests with me. Fast forward to yesterday, they broke up.

What my friend told me is that she told him she didn't want do this anymore and just ghosted him. My friend has been thru a breakup like that some months ago so trauma kicked in and he nuked any contact with her. He asked me to not tell any of our friends about this and asked if I can retrieve a piece of clothing he left on her house (he doesn't live in the same city) on the same day. I felt like that would be incredibly awkward/unconfortable for me and the girl, but I wanted to help so I said yes and braced myself.

I was definitely not prepared: she came out of the house sobbing, immediately hugged me and I kinda froze (I'm not good with social interactions, emotions but I'm still very emphatic so their pain becomes my pain). She then started to infodump on me, telling what happened from her point of view and some of the things she said contradicts what he told me and there was stuff he didn't told me (for the sake of privacy I'm not going to tell this here, but from what I know him I could tell she was telling the truth). Then she apologized for the situation as she noticed I was kinda ""what the hell do I do"" and asked if I could not tell him about what she said, I agreed.

I messaged him to tell I got the clothing piece and he wanted to know how did it go. I made the mistake of telling him that she talked to me and I swore to keep a secret and now he's angry because he feels like even if I'm being loyal, I'm betraying him and leaving him in the dark about the reasons for the breakup (from what she told me, he should know). At this point anxiety and guilty had kicked in so I just apologized, but held my ground and tried to give him talking points for his next therapy appointment without saying a thing about what she said, and he was like ""whatever, you're a disappointment"".

Having not spoken to someone for a while, let’s call him, Bellend, who also has a 6 year old we agree to meet at an aboretum for the day to entertain the children.

We duly meet up and not long into the day Bellend notes my child has those fake tattoos on her arms and quietly says, “surprised you put them on her?” Me, I’m not into tattoos at all but they’re just a bit of fun and she likes them. I note this slight and I’m not happy. 

At some point in the day I say “crap” to which again I get “surprised you swear in front of your child.” More judgement and I’m thinking, “it’s just the word crap” which I consider tame. 

The rest of the day unfolds and fair play, at some point my child falls over and really grazes their leg and Bellend has wipes and helps clean their wound and gives them a treat to cheer them up. 

Bellend is generally affable. Talks much about themselves (but I have a weird way of testing people by asking questions to see if they reciprocate). Bellend doesn’t. He’s quite happy to talk about himself, his extension to his house (he’s always doing work as he’s well off) and a podcast he’s doing (cos he doesn’t do a 9-5 owning as he owns a property portfolio). The podcast, incidentally, he wants my opinion on?! 

Anyway, wind on a week or so later and Bellend is initiating more hanging out with the children. My child isn’t that taken by his as they’re sullen and precious. 

I give Bellend short shrift. 

So here’s the point, you’re judging me on my parenting style yet happy to hang out despite the danger that I might be a bad influence!? Not only this, all you do is talk about yourself. 

Am I the asshole for blanking Bellend, does my potential (likely) underlying jealously of his charmed life play a part in this? Or are they separate?

39,1fv3h6z,AITA for refusing to be the best-man at my best-friend's wedding despite knowing that I might be the closest person he has to family in the wedding-planning process?,"To dive right in, I’ve been best friends with Bill (26M, not his real name) since college. We’ve always been more like family and I love him like a brother. We met as freshmen and were roommates until basically he graduated (I stayed an extra year at that college because I did a co-term ).

Now, Bill has a rough history with his family. Without getting into too much detail, his dad was a terrible person, and that deeply affected Bill’s life. His mom was a bit better, but she never stepped in when he needed support, which strained their relationship. This is important because Bill has only invited a few family members to his wedding—just an uncle and aunt who took care of him during high school. Because of this, he's been adamant that I attend.

Here’s the issue: I don’t like Bill’s fiancée, Amy (25F, not her real name). I can't tolerate her at all. Bill and Amy have been together for about two years, but their relationship has been on-again/off-again. Amy was unfaithful at one point, and although they’ve worked things out, I saw firsthand how much mental torture Bill went through. She’s manipulative and somehow came out of that situation scot-free. As a result, I can’t stand her. I’ve made that clear to both Bill and Amy—probably in language that’s too explicit for this post. Amy also dislikes me and holds a grudge because I told Bill to leave her after she cheated. So, the feeling is mutual.

Anyway, about three weeks ago, Bill called me and asked if I would be his best man. He said he really wanted me there because I’m one of the few people he considers family. I wanted to say yes, but I know that if I’m there, Amy and I will end up in a confrontation. I told Bill I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to be his best man. Attending the wedding is one thing, but being in the wedding party is another. I can't stand her, but Bill insisted. He told me I might be the only ""family"" he has helping him in this process and really needs my support.

I explained to him that, as much as I love him like a brother, I don’t think it’s the right decision given the animosity between Amy and I. After about an hour of back-and-forth, he said he understood. But then he asked me again this week. I feel really bad, but I know myself, and if I’m involved, I’m going to ruin this thing. I don't like her but I don't want to ruin his first-wedding for him. I’m not good at biting my tongue, especially not for months of wedding planning. I've also asked my own younger-brother and my gf. They both also said it was the right call.

I feel guilty, but I believe it was the right call. Was I wrong to say no? AITA?

Edit 1: My writing wasn't the best, so I re-did it and expanded on a few things.

Edit 2: I'm gonna keep this short. I've read all of your comments. Let me be clear, this wedding is going to be hard to watch as I know how abusive she is. I can see how she basically manipulates him while having separate rules for herself. It has caused fights in the past. I am going to be there in the wedding regardless (even if it means being there as a guest) and I thought omitting myself from the best-man role may ease tensions. I fear, knowing Amy, that when I do make the speech and don't mention her or the relationship it's going to cause a massive fight. It may even cause a fight at the wedding itself. I also am not gonna lie to people and say that they are meant to be: they are not (So, I just won't mention it). Not to mention, if she does try to dominate him in the wedding-planning process and I have a seat at the table, I don't think I'm gonna hold my tongue and just let her do it in-front of me. I'll tell him this. If he's fine with it, I'll do it. Now, that doesn’t mean I’m just gonna speak up every time. If he asks for me to stay out of it, or just shut-up, I’ll stay out of it. But if she does that, she can fucking stuff it. I’m doing this for him not them. 

Edit 3: I also want to be clear as there is some argument about this in the comment. I'm gonna be there at the wedding no matter what but I thought I could be there as a guest to not cause problems. The AITA was about being the best-man. Not going to the wedding was never on the table and I'm gonna be there.

Update/Edit: After reading all the messages, consulting my gf and showing her this post I called him and told him I’ll be his best-man. The news clearly has reached Amy’s ears as she’s already causing problems. She clearly doesn’t want me there based on a series of huge text-walls she wrote me basically telling me off. I took screenshots and sent them to Bill. I’m not gonna try not to instigate or escalate but she said some messed up stuff directed towards my family and me. I’m tryna keep it calm but this bitch is testing my patience by saying things about my gf and how she dresses (based on a pic of my gf wearing a low-cut skirt in college). I can already tell this will not end well for anyone involved or in-proximity of this wedding. ",Asshole,2024-10-03,"AITA for refusing to be the best-man at my best-friend's wedding despite knowing that I might be the closest person he has to family in the wedding-planning process? To dive right in, I’ve been best friends with Bill (26M, not his real name) since college. We’ve always been more like family and I love him like a brother. We met as freshmen and were roommates until basically he graduated (I stayed an extra year at that college because I did a co-term ).

Now, Bill has a rough history with his family. Without getting into too much detail, his dad was a terrible person, and that deeply affected Bill’s life. His mom was a bit better, but she never stepped in when he needed support, which strained their relationship. This is important because Bill has only invited a few family members to his wedding—just an uncle and aunt who took care of him during high school. Because of this, he's been adamant that I attend.

Here’s the issue: I don’t like Bill’s fiancée, Amy (25F, not her real name). I can't tolerate her at all. Bill and Amy have been together for about two years, but their relationship has been on-again/off-again. Amy was unfaithful at one point, and although they’ve worked things out, I saw firsthand how much mental torture Bill went through. She’s manipulative and somehow came out of that situation scot-free. As a result, I can’t stand her. I’ve made that clear to both Bill and Amy—probably in language that’s too explicit for this post. Amy also dislikes me and holds a grudge because I told Bill to leave her after she cheated. So, the feeling is mutual.

Anyway, about three weeks ago, Bill called me and asked if I would be his best man. He said he really wanted me there because I’m one of the few people he considers family. I wanted to say yes, but I know that if I’m there, Amy and I will end up in a confrontation. I told Bill I didn’t think it was a good idea for me to be his best man. Attending the wedding is one thing, but being in the wedding party is another. I can't stand her, but Bill insisted. He told me I might be the only ""family"" he has helping him in this process and really needs my support.

I explained to him that, as much as I love him like a brother, I don’t think it’s the right decision given the animosity between Amy and I. After about an hour of back-and-forth, he said he understood. But then he asked me again this week. I feel really bad, but I know myself, and if I’m involved, I’m going to ruin this thing. I don't like her but I don't want to ruin his first-wedding for him. I’m not good at biting my tongue, especially not for months of wedding planning. I've also asked my own younger-brother and my gf. They both also said it was the right call.

I feel guilty, but I believe it was the right call. Was I wrong to say no? AITA?

Edit 1: My writing wasn't the best, so I re-did it and expanded on a few things.

Edit 2: I'm gonna keep this short. I've read all of your comments. Let me be clear, this wedding is going to be hard to watch as I know how abusive she is. I can see how she basically manipulates him while having separate rules for herself. It has caused fights in the past. I am going to be there in the wedding regardless (even if it means being there as a guest) and I thought omitting myself from the best-man role may ease tensions. I fear, knowing Amy, that when I do make the speech and don't mention her or the relationship it's going to cause a massive fight. It may even cause a fight at the wedding itself. I also am not gonna lie to people and say that they are meant to be: they are not (So, I just won't mention it). Not to mention, if she does try to dominate him in the wedding-planning process and I have a seat at the table, I don't think I'm gonna hold my tongue and just let her do it in-front of me. I'll tell him this. If he's fine with it, I'll do it. Now, that doesn’t mean I’m just gonna speak up every time. If he asks for me to stay out of it, or just shut-up, I’ll stay out of it. But if she does that, she can fucking stuff it. I’m doing this for him not them. 

Edit 3: I also want to be clear as there is some argument about this in the comment. I'm gonna be there at the wedding no matter what but I thought I could be there as a guest to not cause problems. The AITA was about being the best-man. Not going to the wedding was never on the table and I'm gonna be there.

Now our apartment is fully furnished with new furniture that all looks good and that my girlfriend and I chose together. We've lived in the house for just under a year now. My girlfriend has started coming home with plants and other decorative items for the apartment.

She doesn't discuss it she just buys them when she sees them. Now she's started telling me the price of them and asking me to send her half of the cost. I refused as she's the one deciding to get them. I don't want or need them and have on say in them being in the apartment so I'm not paying.

She recently started looking at a new bedside cabinet and makeup desk. She was showing me the ones she's picked out and told me again how much and asked me to send her half.

I refused and told her these things are just things she wants, she doesn't need them and that if she wants to replace them she shouldn't be expecting to do it with my money. She got annoyed and said I should be paying half. I asked why since it's her deciding she wants them when she's got a desk and table that is pretty much brand new.

I asked if she would pay half if I decided we needed a new tv but she didn't answer. She just said furniture and decoration should be 50/50 but I again refused and told her I'm not paying half of the cost for everything that she just decides she wants.

She said I was being unreasonable since it's my apartment too.

43,1fv2u2q,AITA for Snapping Back at My Roommate,"Here’s some context. I (21 y/o F) have been friends with this girl named Lisa (21 y/o F) since freshman year of high school.

Towards the end of 2023, me and her still talked and both discovered that we were looking for new places to live. I still lived with my parents, and her work required her to move around a lot. She told me her contract would end with her work in March, and she would be looking for an apartment in the area as well as a job.

I’ve known her for a while, and she’s the only friend I’ve kept outside of high school. We talked to each other every day even after we graduated. My parents told me they didn’t think it was a good idea, because not only was she my friend, but she had shown financial instability prior. While she had never asked me for money, she had gotten money loaned to her by others. I didn’t think much of it at the time.

Fast forward to March, we move in to an apartment together. I had been told that she had a few interviews lined up for a job, and she had already paid her part of the deposit for the apartment with her previous job. A month rolls by, she still doesn’t have a job, and I’m paying for everything at this point. I tried to be considerate, considering we have been best friends for so long, but after a while I was getting kind of fed up. She did eventually get a part time job, but she was only working about 10 hours a week compared to my 40 hours. I was still having to pay for mostly everything.

About 3 months in, she gets upset with me, claiming that I am not doing my fair share of the cleaning. I got upset with her and told her that I was working a full time job, whereas she was not. I told her that I felt that it was more than fair for her to do the cleaning, considering I was providing about 80% of our income. She has since, said it was fine, but there still seems to be some animosity.

She has a full time job now, and we share the cleaning responsibilities, but she still likes to make a point to say that she’s done more of the cleaning since we moved in together, even though she owes me about $5,000 if I was even considering asking her to pay me back.

I am just starting to wonder if maybe I am in the wrong. I don’t want this to held over my head, the same way I don’t want to hold the money over hers.

44,1fv2a4o,AITA for refusing to help my aunt with wedding planning and to be a bridesmaid? ,"I (19f) have known my aunt, Carol (40f) since I was 7, when she started dating my uncle. I don't see them very often since we live on opposite sides of the country (maybe 4-5 times a year), but my dad is very close to his brother so he makes sure we keep in touch. 

Two years ago, my aunt got pregnant. I was super happy because I didn't have any cousins before that, and also because I just love babies. My aunt and uncle had been trying for a baby for a few years and my uncle knew how happy I would be to have a cousin, so, a few years ago he promised me that, if they were one day blessed with a child I would be his godmother, if I wanted to. I was thrilled, and that was one more reason why I was so excited when I found out that my aunt was pregnant. 

Things did not go as planned. I don't have the full story about this, but 8 months ago my cousin was baptized and I was not chose as godmother. Apparently, my uncle asked that he chose the godmother and my aunt chose the godfather, and he asked that I was godmother, but my aunt refused, saying that she was the one who carried the baby for 9 months and had to go through giving birth, so she deserved to choose both. She chose her best friend and brother as god parents. I was a bit disappointed and angry but let it go. 

Three months ago, my uncle proposed and they are getting married in December. They were starting to plan and had made some arrangements, and had chosen their wedding party. But Carol got in a huge fight with her best friend (my cousin's godmother) and they don't talk to each other anymore. Her best friend was supposed to be a bridesmaid, so she was now one bridesmaid short. For that reason, she asked me to be a bridesmaid. She said that she needed help planning the wedding and that ""my creative vision would be appreciated"". 

I thought about accepting, despite knowing that I was just asked because she needed a replacement, but then I found out that my uncle originally wanted me to be in the wedding party, but once again my aunt said no. She told him that she was the one who chose the bridesmaids and he chose the groomsmen. He also asked if I could be a flower girl but she said no. She said something along the lines of ""Stop trying to include her in everything, you're not even that close"". This story could be a little distorted since I heard it from my dad who heard it from other people, but that's pretty much it. 

So I politely declined being a bridesmaid and told her I wasn't sure I was the right choice. She got a bit mad because apparently she doesn't have anyone else to ask and insisted a lot. I then told her that I didn't understand why she wanted me as a bridesmaid since we ""weren't even that close"", and that if she needed a creative vision she should ask a wedding planner. 

I know that my reaction was a bit mean and childish, and I probably should've just gone with it, but I was tired of being her last option, and only being included when she didn't have anyone else.

I will bargain shop and put the rest to it. Yesterday he came yelling at me when he dropped off his monthly payment saying that he tired of supporting 3 households and that I should just use the $300. I use the $300 help pay the kids health insursnce premium each month. Which I told him and he's telling me to go on Medicaid.

He is giving monthly support of $350 a month which is not a lot because I understand he has other kids but I do ask him to help with items like clothing once in a while. But I do bargain shop and usually can get anything my kids need. He is paying support to the other mother of his kids. She makes over 100k a year. Recently I asked him to help but winter clothing for kids. My proposal was that he gives me $100 extra this month to cover new shoes and coats for the kids. I will bargain shop and put the rest to it. Yesterday he came yelling at me when he dropped off his monthly payment saying that he tired of supporting 3 households and that I should just use the $300. I use the $300 help pay the kids health insursnce premium each month. Which I told him and he's telling me to go on Medicaid. I don't qualify for Medicaid in my state and for some reason he thinks I'm lying. He stay telling me how the mother of his other kids struggling and that they've had their water disconnected. I thought it was a lie until her showed me the disconnect notice. I'm not sure how someone with that much income doesn't have water but I feel like that's not my fault. Hes told me that he's paying her close to $700 a month because she's struggling because her bills are higher. I confused because of I made that make money my life would be easier. I still made him give me the extra money because I feel like my kids are in need too. Am I AITA for still making him pay the extra $100,0.0,0.9477779,1,0

   I (25M) am supposed to be going on a weekend trip to an amusement park with my mother and two sisters (it’s far so we got a hotel). My mom invited me a couple months ago and I agreed.
   Here’s where the issues lie, my sisters and occasionally mom like to argue with each other on trips (even single day trips). This has given me a lot of anxiety about going on trips even with friends. It wasn’t till recently that I realized my anxiety comes from my families arguments. So I discussed not going on the trip with my mom and she came off as upset since she paid for the hotel already, but ultimately said it is up to me if I want to go. She understands the arguments can be stressful and promises there wouldn’t be arguments but I know them well. I moved out a year ago just to get away from that.

This person has told others that they and my gf have shared a bed, held hands, cuddled, and slept together. Before my gf and I started dating, this person would talk shit about my her to me, calling her a tease, a player, and saying that she had a bad personality. 

When out with other friends, they bring up these lies and my gf calls them out but they continue to do that as well as rub my gfs back or slyly touch their waist while at the bar.

49,1fv0j9v,AITA for refusing to trade Halloween for Diwali for my children?,"Children involved are 3 and 4.  Born in Canada, so far raised without any religious influence but neither parent is apposed to it.  The father, lets call him Dave, and I have been separated since January 2021. Co-Parenting has been rocky at best.  The relationship was riddled with emotional abuse, IMO Dave is a text book narcissist.  Having finally settled in court, this is the first year that a custody agreement will dictate the division of holidays (alternating each year).  This year, I am entitled to Halloween with our children. Please keep in mind, I have no knowledge of what a Diwali celebration entails and am going only on what Dave has informed me will take place. Forgive my ignorance or incorrect terms! (Additional info on Diwali celebrations are welcome!)

Dave approached me this morning to ask if I would trade years for Halloween - He would take the children this year and I would have them next.  Dave explained that Diwali falls on Halloween this year and that his girlfriend celebrates.  He stated that the children have been invited by her family to join in the celebrations.   Dave stated that the children would be picked up from school, travel 20 minutes to their home where they will have dinner, do Puja #1 at 5:10pm, travel 1 hour to gf's families home, do Puja #2, have a snack, trick-or-treat and go to bed.  They would then stay over night at the gf's families home to continue the Diwali celebration the following day.  

Both October 31st and November 1st are my parenting days.  Dave has not directly asked to have the children for Friday but in stating that they will sleep over and the celebration continues, it is presumed. 

I am of the opinion that it is great for the children to experience other cultures and religions and welcome their participation in Diwali.  However, the children loved Halloween last year and haven't stopped talking about it since! They picked out their costumes in august and tell anyone who will listen what they will be!  I feel that with the travel and additional celebrations, it may make for a very rushed and tiring Halloween.  I don't know how long Puja lasts but the time line does not appear to allow for much time to trick-or-treat.  I do not want their Halloween experience compromised when they will ask again for another full year. 

I have offered a solution to Dave that the kids would trick-or-treat as per usual but could spend Friday with the gf's family to celebrate Diwali.  I also offered to drive the children the 1 hour to their family home, knowing that they will already be there and celebrating.  This way, the children could experience both Halloween and Diwali.  

Dave seems to think that I am trying to control his parenting and it should be a simple trade for Halloween this year for next.  I feel that it is not simply a trade for this year and next because the children may miss out on the Halloween experience as a result of the switch.

Basically there’s this form I’m supposed to fill in, two forms were emailed to me with the instructions fill them in and bring it to the workplace. The first form is clearly marked with places to be filled in by the applicant, which I did. The second form has a paragraph at the top saying to be completed by the hiring manager, so I don’t touch this form at all. 

The first time I brought this in, me along with some others were instructed by someone there on how to fill in this second form by ourselves. This form is full of parts that is weird for us to fill in, such as I attest as the hiring manager that I have verified this, or called this person on this date. Since there was someone guiding me I just followed exactly what he said, and he has checked that it is complete several times.

Cut to a month later I was told there was an issue with the forms and I am to bring them in again. As they didn’t mention what the issue is, I decided to leave the second form blank again, and notified the manager that I do not know how to do this form and I need some help. 

Upon meeting the manager he got upset, asking why I didn’t fill in anything. I said I don’t know what is the issue so if I fill it in based on my memory of the first time, I may make mistakes and have them returned again. So I ask what is the issue of the form, he said he has no idea… so I asked then can I get some help on this because then I don’t know what to do. He then got more upset, I have to explain that because this form says to be completed by hiring manager, I didn’t touch it just to be sure upon meeting him. He said “these forms are emailed to me for me to fill in by myself” while obviously irritated saying he has no time to sit there with me to fill this out. At this point I’m already so scared and I’m just apologizing. 

Basically I’ve been given no choice but to guess what to write, but just as a last resort I asked “may I ask where I’m not supposed to fill in?” He just angrily points at the first form and said “if it says to be filled by the applicant, it’s you…” 

I feel I’m not even listened to, the form is not designed for me to fill in, it doesn’t say anywhere that applicant has to write on it. I just gave up, said ok I’m sorry, and am told to go home and go there again once I have the forms filled. I feel so upset, is this what I have to face if I ever have to ask anything else to him? When I interviewed for this place I was asked what would I do if I was given a task without any instructions, and I answered if I can do it I will, but to avoid guessing I will ask someone that knows what to do, and this is what I get for asking him something this simple.

52,1fv05cb,AITA for refusing to help with my sisters next prom,"I'm unsure about whether I should help my sister with her prom preparations next year as she wants. In the lead-up to her recent prom, I dedicated a lot of time on top of uni, effort, and around $600 from my savings to help her prepare out of kindness. I did her makeup, hair, chose her dress, selected accessories, and did her nails because I wanted to support her.

Five days before prom, she had a full on breakdown over how big her breasts were and how they ruin the dress, creating a tense mood leading up to the event. When I say they were not noticeable, they were not noticeable and the dress did not accentuate them at all. I suggested she get her hair done on prom morning for better hold, but she didn't listen and did it the day before. After getting her hair done, we argued about her sleeping with her lashes on to save time, and she kicked me out of her room, wanting no help, while I still have never done her makeup before after she's declined for weeks.

Later that night, she returned around 11 PM, asking me to practice her makeup again, which was annoying since it was late and last minute literally the day before but I had to practice atleast once. We wrapped up around 3 AM. On prom morning, she wanted a last-minute trip to the mall for feathers and accessories because her friend was using them. I told her it was too late, and she went silent.

That morning she tried to refresh her hair, as I suspected, her curls fell out, leading to a major breakdown. She spent an hour on her phone, refusing help on prom morning. Eventually, she let me fix her hair, but just as I started her makeup, her friend arrived, saying her makeup artist had canceled. Without warning, my sister invited her over for me to do both their makeup, adding stress since I had only two hours and not prepared for that. Her friend came without her hair done or accessories.

As I finished my sister's base makeup and started on friend's makeup, my sister worked on her friend's hair. While chatting, I mentioned how frustrated it was for us that none of the stores had her bra size which was a common size, which I thought was neutral. This upset her, and once her friend left, my sister had a HUGE breakdown because I exposed her bra size. I apologized, but her tears wiped away all the base makeup, also risking her lashes falling off.

I had to start from scratch, instead of just doing her eye makeup, with just 30 minutes before her ride arrived. I rushed to finish makeup and fix her hair, but when she saw a picture of her friend's on-theme outfit, she got frustrated at me. She said I should have taken her to the mall for accessories and said she didn’t want to go to prom anymore ( she went)

In the most recent catch up talk, I was talking about my upcoming big 18th bday and Meghan got slightly upset when I brought up the fact that one of my other best friends, Sadie (16F), offered her mansion like house as a hosting house. Both Sadie and Meghan know that I’ve been having family issues and both offered to host my 18th birthday at their houses (However, Sadie not only offered first, has a bigger house, and got her dad to agree before asking- but I know that Meghan’s family wouldn’t like a bunch of my friends, some of which Meghan doesn’t know, at her house- It’s ridiculous and although I’m grateful to both of them, I feel like Meghan is pissed at me for hanging out with Sadie more recently.

Sadie and I have bonded more recently due to our family issues as well as us both practically being neighbors. Sadie doesn’t get jealous of Meghan either and has let me invite Meghan to her parties before multiple times (in which Meghan bails on me or complains that her parties are “boring”). 

It’s irritating, I mean I love Meghan but anytime I try to hangout with her it just ends sourly. One time she even invited me to hangout with her bf and her and they banged upstairs mid way through. I’m proud of her for getting her life straight but I cant with her being angry at me for hanging out with someone else when she never hangs with me even when I’ve offered.

And I just feel a vein pop when I read it- 

I have time to hang out with my friends so I DO!

54,1fuzn8c,AITA if I’m starting to resent my friend. ,"I 17 year old female, senior in high school and my friend who’s the same age and same grade as me, have been friends since 6 grade. It’s a lot of time but I don’t really consider her as a best friend just a close friend. Since 6 grade I felt like she felt some type of jealousy towards me but I’ve always disguised those feelings. When I started wearing skirts for school because i thought they looked cuter, she did too. I started getting good grades and she did too. I started to get better at my English and she did too, when before she had no interest in them.  Throughout my high school years she kept this behavior but I as always just ignored them, especially for this year, I wanted to enjoy my last year and forget about all the bad stuff. 
Thanks to COVID my skills when speaking English became really bad. When I entered high school for my freshman year, there was this biology teacher who would always say nice things to me, he would encourage me to speak, he would try to talk to me about sports we both liked, he would also show interest in my culture. Since then he’s been my favorite teacher. This year he’s teaching anatomy, and me and my friend are in his class.  At first when she found out he was going to be our teacher, she started to judge him saying she didn’t want to have him as a teacher and that he didn’t know how to teach, and that he was boring. I obviously defended him and told her that if she wanted to she could change the class but I was going to stay because I knew he was a great teacher. A couple days into the class I guess she saw the relationship we shared and how he treated me. Out of the sudden, a day she started to only be at his desk talking to him about tennis (a sport we all like). Now, every chance of free time we get, shes at his desk. I’ve tried to make conversation with him but she will find a way to make herself the main character and leave me out of it. It’s becoming annoying for me to not be able to talk to my favorite teacher because my friend doesn’t gives me a chance to.  My mom says I should talk to her but I don’t want to sound toxic or be crazy about it. I actually do feel jealous but idk if I should be. After all they’re both free to talk to whoever they want, it just annoys me that she didn’t even liked him and now she’s all over him. 
What should I do?",Asshole,2024-10-03,"AITA if I’m starting to resent my friend.  I 17 year old female, senior in high school and my friend who’s the same age and same grade as me, have been friends since 6 grade. It’s a lot of time but I don’t really consider her as a best friend just a close friend. Since 6 grade I felt like she felt some type of jealousy towards me but I’ve always disguised those feelings. When I started wearing skirts for school because i thought they looked cuter, she did too. I started getting good grades and she did too. I started to get better at my English and she did too, when before she had no interest in them.  Throughout my high school years she kept this behavior but I as always just ignored them, especially for this year, I wanted to enjoy my last year and forget about all the bad stuff.

I’m also the fastest on the team (we’ve done multiple races and determined that), yet he never lets me play during practice. He lets every new member try besides me, I’m almost always sitting alone on the bench. The only time he called on me was when he needed my shoes for a girl that’s not even in the team to play because they were short on people. 

He also makes fun of my ‘american accent’ constantly, ‘acts like a white girl’ to mock me, and even told me he wished foreigners would get out of Cyprus. What I’m getting at here is that I think he’s a bit racist towards me.

Fast forward to when I post a picture on instagram (he follows the whole team on insta) and he replies with “Fatty”, for the record I’m 121 pounds and 5”3, I’m not overweight and then he proceeded to ask me for private pictures. I laugh about it because I didn’t take it seriously but he said there was nothing funny. 

It pissed me off so I told him, that I could lose the ‘weight’ but he will never lose the receding hairline, and the shitty personality, I then told him that he was a horrible coach and that I desperately hope he’d get changed next year. 

My friends are telling me I took it too far and that I should never talk to a coach like that no matter what. Now my coach is contemplating kicking me off the team.

We met over 8 years ago, and were practicaly attached at the hip throughout school. The type of friendship where people saw one of us and expected the other to be in tow. 

Well after graduation we drifted a bit. She went off to college (still in our hometown) and became busy. I simply brushed off the lack of interactions to her being in school and the reason we hardly talked. Any comunication with her from my end was answered with dry conversations and disintrest.

I attended a movie with her in Febuary of 2024 in hopes of fixing our friendship. However she split off and ignored me sitting on the other side of the theature. Then no conversations or interasctions untill accidently bumping into eachother at a fireworks show. She approached me this time, chatting for maybe 30 minutes before leaving. 

Afterwards I receved one late birthday message then no contact untill this Halloween invite. The akward part is, after the firworks show I see she posted ""Im engaged"". Through the post I learned her younger boyfriend proposed the day after the fireworks show. Her post was about a week and a half after that. I guess Im foolish in thinking we were close enough for me to have gotten a ""Guess what! Im engaged!"" message. 
Additionally, because we had't talked regularly I only leared she was dating the HS age younger brother of a separate friend, when we were at the same event at the end of 2023. Besides the point, I feel uncomofortable knowing he proposed during his senior photos. I've reached out in the past about not feeling like theres anything to out friendship anymore, and got a mundane answer about how we were ""just busy and all good"".

My MIL has always been big about wanting to help with the baby, and before she was born, has offered to watch her while I am at work. I asked many times to make sure that she was still ok with that (making sure to state that we were fine sending her to daycare), but she insisted that she wanted to. So now she watches our daughter for 1.5 days a week. We offered to pay her, she said she didn’t need it.

My MIL has been stressing to my husband and I how important it is to spend time with each other without the baby, and often (this comes up probably twice a month) says she will watch the baby so that we can go out together. She has even offered to take the baby overnight. The problem comes when we try to take her up on it. There have been now several occasions where she bails on us last minute, claiming that she forgot or that she thought we weren’t serious about it.

Most recently, my husband bought concert tickets and she was going to watch the baby, but now says she has plans. My FIL told us he would watch the baby, and she got very angry at him and said he couldn’t. I’m pissed at her for flaking last minute. On the one hand, I think if she doesn’t want to babysit, she needs to say so instead of pretending that she is willing to watch the baby. On the other, I feel like my husband and I are entitled for assuming that it is her job to watch the baby - after all, it is our kid not hers. And we could always hire a babysitter, which I think we are going to do, but I’m still mad.

**UPDATE**
I talked to my MIL last night after I picked the baby up. I didn’t mention the concert, but just told her how I much I appreciate everything she does for us. I asked her if it was too much, as I know watching the baby is a lot of work. She said that it is not and that she loves watching the baby.

She repeated again that she and my FIL would be fine watching the baby a night two or three times a month for a few hours if they are free, but she clarified that she needs to have notice and she needs to have it in her calendar.

When I told my husband about this, he said that he thinks that might be part of it, however, he talked to his sister, and they both think that my MIL purposely flaked on the concert because she thinks my husband is not spending enough time with the baby (he is very busy, he works full time and is in evening classes 3 days a week, so it is usually me and the baby at home).

All my life, my parents have told me they’d give me money for a down payment on a house or help me have a big wedding—whichever I preferred. I’m more introverted, so I want a smaller wedding, like 50 people or fewer (about 24 couples). That caused some tension with my mom at first because I want specific aunts and uncles there to help transport the grandparents. But my mom insists that I have to invite all the aunts and uncles, or none. I feel like that’s ridiculous, but I agreed to a compromise.

Now, here’s the real issue: I’ve been super picky about the venue because I’m marrying my high school sweetheart and want this to be a once-in-a-lifetime thing. I want a garden wedding or maybe something by a lake. After months of searching, I finally found the perfect venue and toured it. But then, literally a week later, Hurricane Helene hit Asheville, destroying the town where the venue is located. While the wedding is still 10 months away, the roads are gone, and planning a wedding there is out of the question since most of our guests are from out of state.

So, I went into a panic trying to find a new venue in the Southeast. After more searching, I found another venue that’s actually better than the original, but it’s expensive. I made a super detailed spreadsheet, and the total came to $17k, while our original budget was $15k.

Now, this is causing tension with my fiancé. He picked Canada for our honeymoon, but now he says he won’t have enough money for it if he pays for it himself, especially if we use all the wedding money. He was also planning for us to use the $5k my parents gave me for the honeymoon and furniture, and now he doesn’t think we should spend the extra $2k on the venue. 

**Others told me it was important to add that we will not have the honeymoon to ourselves and we will hangout/travel with one of his longtime friends who is stationed near Canada.

Here’s the thing: I’ve been working 30 hours a week doing an internship through most of college while also taking 18 credit hours a semester, so we can both graduate on time. Because of that, I feel like I should indulge for our special day. Especially since I originally wanted to elope and go to Japan, but he doesn’t like Japan, so I compromised by agreeing to have my dream wedding if I don’t get my dream elopement. I’ve looked at other venues nearby, but I haven’t felt a connection with any of them the way I do with this one even though they are in our 15k budget range.

64,1fuxa4x,AITA For Kicking My Friend Off My YouTube Channel?,"So about a month ago, I kicked a friend of three years off of my YouTube channel, which he had been helping me on. At first, I let him create his ""own"" video, and by that I mean I approved a topic suggestion from him and then let him write (most) of it, and then I added in the visuals and posted it. My YouTube channel is for history videos, and he decided to make a 'what if' kind of situation instead. At first, I wasn't bothered by this, but quickly it became my second most popular video.

Since it was so popular, I created another 'what if' kind of history video. Now, my friend, who we'll call Cameron, suggested turning it into a series, which I reluctantly agreed to. Over the next week, he created flags, national foods, religions, etc. I mostly edited the videos visually and worked on the scripts, which took over 15 hours a week, which I quickly got tired of.



The first red flag was when he started asking to be the narrator and edit videos, while also inviting people to work on the channel without even asking me. The first person he asked was actually one of my closest friends, who we'll call Kaleb. He never became very involved so I let it slide. Then, Cameron asked someone else to start writing the scripts with him, whom I didn't even know, which really pissed me off.

A few weeks later, he decided to make me a schedule of when I worked on the videos, since I missed an upload to my channel every other month, and he genuinely tried to get me to adhere to it, which was my last straw.

I sent him, and the now 5 people that he had added, a long and lengthy message explaining my decision. I kindly stated everything mentioned above. I also said that he could stay with a much more minor role, and he said he understood. A little later, Kaleb responded, and he later told me he didn't really care that I kicked him out since he wasn't really even doing anything, and he wanted me to have full control of my own YouTube channel.

About an hour later, Cameron responded and said I couldn't use anything he had even slightly worked on, and that I couldn't use any of the art assets either. I didn't really care, since I wouldn't record those 'what if' scripts or use his artwork anyway, but later he flipped and said I could. Another hour went by, and he demanded a Discord call, which Kaleb and I joined.

In summary, he was pissed and trying to negotiate with me, which I didn't want to do. He also kept saying how he wanted to expand and add even MORE people, to create videos faster - the opposite of what I wanted.

After the call, Kaleb and I chatted and he told me Cameron talked behind my back, calling me lazy due to my upload schedule. He also told me Cameron didn't care how long it took, but that I also needed to improve the quality - polar opposites. Cameron claims that I made a massive power grab, which caused him to hate me, but I think he was usurping power and turning this into his own YouTube channel while doing minimum work. So what do we think, AITA?

65,1fux869,"AITA for kicking my depressed sister out of my room and not being as ""comforting?""","I, Mark (19M), and my sister Lucy (23F) got into an awkward situation today. Lucy has been going through a breakup with her fling, Alex (25M). They weren’t in a real relationship; it was more of a friends-with-benefits situation, and they met at work since they're coworkers. About a week ago, he met someone new and wants to pursue a long-term relationship with her. At 25, he’s trying to get his life together, but Lucy wasn’t offering him that. So, for the last two days, she’s been moping around the house because he officially ended things with her. She hasn’t been eating and is going through the usual post-breakup feelings.

Don’t get me wrong—I understand she’s upset, but she’s been really clingy. I've been super busy lately with school, work, the gym, and my own life, while she’s only working at Home Depot, and her shifts have slowed down, so she’s at home a lot more. I’ve got midterms next week, and it's been tough trying to focus on my priorities while constantly trying to cheer her up. I don’t have any experience with relationships, so I’ve told her multiple times that I’m not much help. Still, I’ve been there for her—talked to her about things we both like, made her laugh a little, and even offered to watch a movie together.

She’s been wanting me to sleep in her bed with her. I offered to let her sleep in my bed instead, but she got offended. I find her bed uncomfortable, so I prefer my own space to do assignments, watch my shows, or game with my friends. It gets a bit much when she’s moping right next to me, bringing down the mood.

Today, I came back from my walk and found her sleeping in my room. It was still early—around 8:45 PM—so I turned on the light to enjoy the rest of my evening. She got mad and told me to turn it off. I told her, “It’s early, and if you want to sleep with the lights off, go to your own room.”

I’ve been happy lately, which is rare for me, and she’s been dragging me down. I’m in a good routine with the gym, school, spending time with family, and working at my restaurant job 1-2 times a week. It’s going well for me, and I feel like I’m making progress, while she’s stuck in a rut.

Honestly, I don’t think this breakup is that big of a deal since they were never even in a relationship. I asked her before if Alex was her boyfriend, and she always said “no.” I used to joke about it all the time, and she always laughed and said “no.” I’ve supported her as much as I can—I’ve made my presence known and even hugged her for an awkwardly long time. What more can I do? I like where I am in life right now, but it feels like my energy drops when I’m around her. I’ve helped as much as I can.

*To add some humor, I was smiling with my AirPods in, listening to One Direction on my walk before I came home and found her in my room. That’s where I’m at in terms of vibe level right now.*

In all honesty, I had never thought of it that way, since I pictured Jia with naturally playful behavior towards those people close to her.

67,1fuv761,AITA for making convention performance plans close to a family trip?,"Using a throwaway for this because I normally don't use Reddit.

I (19) am a cosplay idol who just recently got into the performing scene this year and have been planning to perform at a convention that takes place during my winter break from college/university for months prior. Unfortunately, I don't have as many chances as the rest of my other group members to perform as I am an out of state student. I also just got invited to take part in hosting a panel with one of my cosplay friends at the con, which has me even more hyped to perform there.

Here's the main issue: the con is a three hour drive from my house, and my family has also planned an international family trip that ends right around when the con starts. My family has always planned international trips at least once every year, so this isn't new to me. They're travel junkies; meanwhile although I don't mind traveling that much I prefer having more freedom in plans whenever I do so. The con is also at the beginning of January, so not to long after New Year's Day.

Now, this is where I believe I might be the AH for this. One of my fellow idol group members has also offered to the rest of us a space to stay at his house for the con, so I myself most definitely wouldn't need to worry about hotel costs if he agrees to let me stay at his place. I called my mom asking about the con and she was initially concerned about me being so jetlagged after the trip while making a 3 hour drive up to the convention center. She knows about my plans to perform and partake in the panel there, but she kept trying to convince me out of performing with my group and fellow panelists. I even told her before that I sent the contact information of the friend who offered a place to stay, but she still held her ground and kept advising I should skip the con. She hasn't actually bought tickets for the trip yet, but she said that coming back before the 1st of January is very expensive considering the timing of the holiday. I kept trying to convince her to let me go, but she kept saying no.

While I understand her concerns, not to mention how jetlagged I'd be at the con considering the timing, I really want to go considering how long I've planned my performances. I can't help but see how my actions make me look very selfish and appear very uncaring about my mom's feelings. 

I left the call feeling upset because of how I had planned for this con for so many months before, but I also feel selfish because I don't like appearing as if I don't care about the rest of my family (I love them to bits, but sometimes they're a bit much).

68,1fuv4e8,WIBTAH for abandoning the lease I signed?,"I'm going to preface this by saying that I have solid legal grounds by which I could leave my current lease due to mould problems and potential asbestos concerns (thank you housing crisis in my country).

Anyway, for context, my ex (25F) and I (29M) ended our 5 year relationship 4 months ago after signing the lease for our current place 2 months prior. It was a pretty mutual decision I think, as we both recognised our feelings for each other were no longer the same and we were just going through the motions without any of the romantic emotions. We were still good friends for and to each other as we still cared for each other and had essentially just been in a close friendship for the past year or 2. So we decided that we would both stay until the end of the lease and split house duties 50/50.

We also care for our 2 cats, an older(age unknown), anxious shorthair, and a 3 y.o., ginger gremlin. We love them both but my ex very clearly favors the older cat and the ginger seems to adore me. The problem is that, not only are they registered solely under her name, but she doesn't really make much of an effort to look after them. Sure, if I'm not home (I often work nights) she might feed them while I'm away but, whenever it comes down to buying food and litter, I'm the one going to do it. If I'm going to be home, she avoids anything to do with the caretaking, to the point where it goes multiple days to, sometimes, over a week without her actually touching the litter or feeding them. And on top, she's begun shorting me the cash for their stuff by rounding down on whatever number I give her from a few bucks all the way up to $10. 

I usually wouldn't be a stickler for such minimal amounts but it brings me to the other part of this. She's also been doing the same for our bills (which all go through my accounts since hers take care of the rent) and so I've been having to cut down on my subscriptions (that she also used free of charge) to just get by. I keep asking to set aside a time to talk about this but there always seems to be something she's doing or she just simply won't be home/be asleep when I'm around so I can't really talk to her face to face. Now, it's been about a month and a half of this, and she recently got with a new guy, but that's no excuse, right?

So I just want to get out of here and find a new place but I know she will: 1. Want me to take the ginger cat, and 2. Want me to pay out the lease so she ""wouldn't have to stress."" I have a little bit of savings but I'm also living somewhat tight financially so I wouldn't be able to pay out the lease but could afford to get into a new place. So, considering she's avoiding talking about it, I'm considering just up and leaving.

I usually wouldn't be a stickler for such minimal amounts but it brings me to the other part of this. She's also been doing the same for our bills (which all go through my accounts since hers take care of the rent) and so I've been having to cut down on my subscriptions (that she also used free of charge) to just get by. I keep asking to set aside a time to talk about this but there always seems to be something she's doing or she just simply won't be home/be asleep when I'm around so I can't really talk to her face to face. Now, it's been about a month and a half of this, and she recently got with a new guy, but that's no excuse, right?

So I just want to get out of here and find a new place but I know she will: 1. Want me to take the ginger cat, and 2. Want me to pay out the lease so she ""wouldn't have to stress."" I have a little bit of savings but I'm also living somewhat tight financially so I wouldn't be able to pay out the lease but could afford to get into a new place. So, considering she's avoiding talking about it, I'm considering just up and leaving. 

WIBTAH for this?

69,1fuv1az,AITA Not Responding Appropriately to my Roommate,"AITA for not responding ""appropriately"" to my roommate?

Let me preface this by saying that I have autism, and a lot of my emoting comes from masking.
I've tried to explain this to them but, since they have autism and share very few overlying symptoms with me, I feel like they don't really understand it. 
They also have a tendency to be kind of sensitive and I find they're easily upset by things they've interpreted me doing. 
Ex, I'll say ""oh I don't really like this show"" and they'll interpret that as me saying ""I hate your interests and don't want to talk to you about them"" when all I meant was... Its not a show I liked for myself?

I try to put in effort to make sure I'm engaging with them in a way that doesn't hurt their feelings, because they're important to me, but that means constantly masking which is hard to maintain when you live with someone because I'm incredibly burnt out by it all the time.

Today, over text, they told me about a new project they're working on, and as I had just woken up and was still out of it, I responded saying ""oh cool"". 
They got upset, said ""Nvm"" and when I tried explaining it wasn't meant unenthusiastically and I would love to hear more about it, they shut down the conversation and have proceeded to move around the apartment, slamming doors, playing loud music next to my room, and ignoring my texts. 
I kind of feel like this behavior is immature and unwarranted, and don't really think it's an equivalent reaction to me not responding the way they'd like me to. 
I also just wish they'd understand that we are very different people, and the way we show interest/engagement is different. I've explained I completely mask myself to meet their needs and I don't think they really understand to what extent, or how I could even explain this properly without them telling me that if I don't communicate the way they want me to then we can't be friends anymore (which they have done before).

So does anyone have any advice? Am I being a total dick here and just not understanding it, or is this an overreaction and unfair demand on me?
Really confused and hoping for some clarification. Thanks!",Not the A-hole,2024-10-03,"AITA Not Responding Appropriately to my Roommate AITA for not responding ""appropriately"" to my roommate?

70,1fuuwfr,AITA For Not Helping My Father With Immigration,"So me 16(f) have never been close with my father 39 (m) who lives out of the country though maybe 2 times a year with an hello and how are you. But after I met my brother (his child) who lives near me we begin doing activities with each other and getting to know each other. And after that I thought perhaps I should make an effort to build a relationship with him. I had never tried in the past really because he’s never helped with a dime, but after my mother expressed because of the distance and how it’s not the easiest where he lived I decided to give him grace. That was until my brother told me had over 4 children where he lives (all younger than me) who he doesn’t take care of either. And he also has a strained relationship with his younger daughter who lives up there with him because his 17 (f) pregnant girlfriend  treats her bad and he doesn’t do anything . And he also has the crazy idea that this child will be different and he’ll be the “ideal and great father”. When he could just try with his current children.

 After I found all this out my decision to permanently made to end my relationship with him was made because I will never support a predator who has impregnated a minor and also cares little for his kids. Weeks later he reached out asking if I could help with his papers ( he wants me to pretend like he wants to come back here because of his kids in the state to build relationships them and so on). While abandoning the 4 that already live where he is now. So, I cursed him out and blocked him.
