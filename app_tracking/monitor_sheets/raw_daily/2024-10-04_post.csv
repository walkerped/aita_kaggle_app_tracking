0,1fvymv9,AITA for not telling my mother about the medication I take?,"I \[21ftm\] have been on HRT for about 1.5 years now. My mother hasn't always been the most supportive of this and wants to take a closer look at the medicine I've been prescribed, or the pamphlet that comes with it, or to see the doctor I got the prescription from.

Every time she asks I feel incredibly anxious to the point that my throat closes up and I can't talk. I don't know if she genuinely just wants to know what it is or if she's trying to figure out a way to take it away from me (which wouldn't be as big of a deal if it weren't for the fact that the prescription is supposed to be absorbed through the skin. It's unlikely that it'd do anything if my mother did touch it but I don't want to risk my mother touching it *at all*).

I'm not sure if my gut feeling is right. On one hand, she is my mother, so normally she's entitled to know what medicine I'm taking in any context (and also, I do wish I could talk to her about what being trans means to me).

On the other hand, it really doesn't sit right with me that she should know everything I'm doing for myself without showing any sign that she accepts me for who I am now. I know it's probably hard for her to see me as anything other than her daughter, but every time she asks she always uses this interrogative tone I can't bring myself to trust that nothing bad will happen if I am totally open and honest with her.",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-10-04,"AITA for not telling my mother about the medication I take?

My gf recently broke up with me because she thinks I am not committed to our relationship and showing no initiative in working things out. We started a conflict resolution course, which has some significant time demands to be effective, and although I welcome this, I find it near impossible to work 10 hrs/day, therapy 1x/week, PT 1x/week, come home to have dinner with her and my daughter (from past relationship) and also prioritize doing the module and workbook activities. Regardless, I think I have shown initiative and enthusiasm on doing these activities and staying on schedule. I do the work every day to some degree.

I dropped the ball, and showed no interest in doing the activities one night because I was tired and needed to wake up early. She called me out on this, making the generalization that I show no initiative and expect her to do all the work. I tried to stay very neutral and calm as she was saying all this because it really felt like a slap in the face. 

Long story short, she got very angry, accusatory, critical, assumptive, and demeaning. She said she was ""not really interested in long term plans"" with me any more. Time came for her to pay her portion of the rent and utilities, and when I brought this up, she paid, and then demanded that I pay her for the reservations we made for the future

**- Flight for her friends to fly out here and spend some time with us (I suggested we cover their flight, since last time they came we had to leave town for and emergency)**

**- Reservation to a VERY expensive hotel spa for us and her friends (this was her idea).**

So I refused to pay for these because I don't think it is right to effectively exclude someone from a plan and still expect them to contribute to it. She broke up with me and said she wants no more future plans, yet wants me to pay for our upcoming plans that she is now taking away from me. She called me a lot of mean things when I put my foot down on this, and threatened small claims court, which I agreed she should do. 

Then she told me I could still come to all the things. In order to stay true to my principle, I thanked her and paid her my share, but nothing has changed, and she is  angry at me for being uncompromising in my stance.

Honestly, I think it's a rough patch that we will get through like we always do, but was I the asshole here? I am doing A LOT of work on myself, including being kind, reciprocal, but also firmly setting boundaries and being confident in my principles.

4,1fw70lr,AITA I don’t want to move to the IE ? ,"
I (29F) have finally reached a position I’ve been working so hard for here in the city I grew up with. My BF has also started a new role in May which a completely different career path than what he was working in.  As of recently his family has been dealing with a couple tragedies with one being the loss of a brother. My partner has been thinking about the idea of possibly moving back home to be closer to his mom (60F) because he’s not sure how much time he has with her. 

Now I’ve never imagined myself moving back to his hometown and that’s simply bc as a coincidence I’ve had family growing up there and never understood why anyone would live in what ppl refer to as the “boonies”. Most of the ppl that live there either work in warehouses or commute an hour or two to make it to a decent job. I’ve done some research on my position and compared salaries and we are talking about a $15 difference. Living in CA you know that’s a huge pay cut.

I’m not saying I would never move but right now is not my time. I want to complete my vesting years at work to get my full retirement + stock. This is something that will be completed in 3 more years not in the next 3 months. 

EDIT- We’ve been together and shared a place for 4 years. He is my best friend, my lover, my person!  I see a future with him and hope we get to spend forever but I think this is a big decision that needs to be well thought out rather than needing an immediate response. We currently live in a two bedroom apartment and have even suggested she move in with us but somehow that’s not an option for someone (either him or her) or somehow forgotten?

My stepson lives in NH so we don't see him as much as we would like, but in the summer, we spend a lot more time in NH watching him race in Motorcross, just the two of us and him, some weekends it's a double header so we are gone both Sunday and Saturday, we don't always take anyone with us because our 15yr old has better things to do, the oldest of the 4 has her own life, and it's a long day for the baby, 12 hours in the sun and heat, we live in MA and don't have a camper for him to get out of the elements, hoping for one next summer.

This past weekend my stepson came to visit for a few days, all is good until today, my fiancé and my stepson went fishing alone, did not ask my daughter & grandson to go, and I feel bad because my grandson has a fishing pole but has never been fishing, he loves being outside, it is his favorite thing to do, and I know he is only two, but it's such a fun thing to do with all ages, and my daughter she is alone a lot with the baby very overstimulated as a stay at home mom. I just feel like it was rude of him to not ask them to go.

I feel like he would never exclude our daughter or his son but excludes my oldest two daughters. to add salt to the wound last year my ex-husband passed away of a heart attack he was only 48, so in 26 days it will be a year since he passed away, so my girls are both still grieving him, feeling the loss of their dad pretty heavy. My fiancé not inviting her just seems extra mean, knowing she is missing her father as much as she is. AITA for being upset that he didn't ask them to go along?

I have to add that part of me feels like getting time alone with his son is all he is trying to do, and he thinks it is harmless, and because she lives with us getting space from her and the baby is also harmless, but he does not ever do anything with them outside of the house unless I make a plan, he works 4 days on and 4 days off rotation schedule so he is home with her for 4 days when I am at work and does nothing with either of them sometimes he stays in our bedroom all day and ignores them, that alone pisses me off because what is your issue buddy.

9,1fw669g,WIBTA if I pushed to get rid of the dog?,"
Let me start this by saying, I (F 28) sincerely and deeply, to my core love animals with everything I am. 

We have a golden retriever and pekingese. The pekingese is 12, our little sugar-face and the golden retriever is 4. 

Last week Saturday, my husband (M 28) got a message from his dad of a post on facebook - a 3 year old black shepherd (f) and 5 month old black shepherd x wolfdog (m) needed a home. My husband fell in love with the little boy instantly and started joking about bringing him home. Then his dad actually went to go and meet up with the owners to see the dogs. And then they were on their way home with them. 

Husband’s parents live on a small “farm”. So they have the space and recourses for pets and impulsive decisions.

When we met the dogs, there was instantly a little connection between me and pupper, he was scared of everyone but snuggled up to me. We made an impulsive decision and he came home with us. The agreement being he could go back to husband’s parents if needed. 

Normally my husband is the analytical one. He thinks things through, makes plans and I’m the impulsive one…

On Sunday I already started spiralling. On Monday I mentioned it to husband and asked my brother for his opinion. They both just told me I need to give it time because I am anxious and by nature I don’t do well with change. I thought of all the challenges we had just created for ourselves. How small our place is. 

My husband has been trying to make things as easy as possible. He takes the pup for walks 2 times a day when he can. But this little guy is so scared of everything. He won’t go outside by himself. So we both need to stand outside and wait for him to do his thing, because he won’t go without  BOTH OF US. My husband is a musician and goes on tour over weekends as well, sometimes it’s longer.

The thing that’s getting to me the most is that our other fur babies are miserable. The golden has patience for a little while then she’ll growl and get a bit snappy. Our pekingese full in loses his mind if he gets in his space. They’re both so sulky and it breaks my heart. I know dogs adapt and whatnot but this feels impossible. 

Am I wrong to not want him to stay? It breaks my heart. I love him already. I want my husband to be happy and have the dog he wants. I just don’t think we’re at the right stage in our lives for this. I feel selfish, but I am also overwhelmed. I want to make the right decision for all of us.

When we met the dogs, there was instantly a little connection between me and pupper, he was scared of everyone but snuggled up to me. We made an impulsive decision and he came home with us. The agreement being he could go back to husband’s parents if needed. 

Normally my husband is the analytical one. He thinks things through, makes plans and I’m the impulsive one…

On Sunday I already started spiralling. On Monday I mentioned it to husband and asked my brother for his opinion. They both just told me I need to give it time because I am anxious and by nature I don’t do well with change. I thought of all the challenges we had just created for ourselves. How small our place is. 

My husband has been trying to make things as easy as possible. He takes the pup for walks 2 times a day when he can. But this little guy is so scared of everything. He won’t go outside by himself. So we both need to stand outside and wait for him to do his thing, because he won’t go without  BOTH OF US. My husband is a musician and goes on tour over weekends as well, sometimes it’s longer.

The thing that’s getting to me the most is that our other fur babies are miserable. The golden has patience for a little while then she’ll growl and get a bit snappy. Our pekingese full in loses his mind if he gets in his space. They’re both so sulky and it breaks my heart. I know dogs adapt and whatnot but this feels impossible. 

Am I wrong to not want him to stay? It breaks my heart. I love him already. I want my husband to be happy and have the dog he wants. I just don’t think we’re at the right stage in our lives for this. I feel selfish, but I am also overwhelmed. I want to make the right decision for all of us.

10,1fw61x8,AITA for not thanking my boyfriend enough?,"My (31m) boyfriend (33m) and I have been dating for a bit over a year. I’ve always tried to be supportive and appreciative of him. I had thought that i was appreciative enough i always thank him when he does nice things, and I thank him for more big-picture stuff pretty often as well. Recently, though, we got in a fight about how often I thank him.

For context, I work in a relatively well-paid but high-stress field and my boyfriend works at a lower-paid but not at all stressful (in his words) job. As a result, I pay the vast majority of the bills. Because I work significantly more hours than him, he usually does around 60% of the household tasks. One of the things I’m almost always in charge of is cooking, and on days where i cook, he usually does the dishes. I always thank him when the topic comes up, and if I see him washing them.

Last night, I got home from work absolutely exhausted and cooked a labor-intensive dish, so after we finished, I went straight up to our bedroom and basically crashed. He woke me up a couple hours later to remind me to take out the trash. After I got back inside, he started to complain about how ungrateful I was. He said that in addition to not thanking him for the dishes, I didn’t thank him for a lot of other things. Here’s the list of things I remember him saying I didn’t thank him for enough:

-(I’m transgender ftm) Not complaining when I said I wanted to get top surgery
-Not cheating on me
-Feeding “our” cat (he got her without my input, and I said that he could keep her but that he’d need to be fully responsible for her)
-Not telling people I’m trans
-Not pissing on the toilet seat (I’d previously gotten annoyed with him over it and asked him to stop)
-Not bringing peanuts into the house (I have a very severe allergy)

I’d thanked him for most of them at least once, but he said that if it was something he did more than once I should thank him more than once. At this point, I was at the end of my rope, so I snapped at him (which I did apologize for over text this morning) and basically called him a hypocrite because he doesn’t thank me as often as I thank him and said he shouldn’t expect to be thanked for the bare minimum.

I ended up sleeping on the couch last night. Because I have a day off, I woke up after he left the house. He left a post-it note on the counter that said “I won’t be doing my usual jobs today, since I apparently only do the bare minimum.”

I’m really confused because I know my boyfriend is a reasonable person, and I don’t want to be a bad partner, but I still don’t understand whether/what I did wrong.

11,1fw60js,AITA for renting a car to my sick dad?,"I (27M) have been together with my wife (27F) for 11 years now. We've always been able to find common ground, but this time is different.

My family had a big financial problem 2 years ago and money has been is tight.

My dad (57M), is not healthy. In the last year he had 3 heart attacks, his kidneys are failing and he needs hemodialysis. He has to go to the doctor often and once every couple of months he feels weak, almost falls down or almost passes out and my mom (58F) rushes him to the hospital.

As of work, he works for 2 companies at the same time.

I have an older sister (32F), who's living with my parents for the last 2 years. She has a job and doesn't help with the bills. My mom says she says when she has money and buys a meal, 5 times a month. But my mom also complaints about my sister going around buying pens and other things while we struggle to pay the bills.

I am working 3 jobs, pay for my parents health insurance, 750$ of old debts (mine and my sisters), phone bill for me, my wife, my sister and brother-in-law and routinely send money to help my parents with food/medicine.

Now the car problem. None of us have a car. My mother in law gifted my wife her old car. I have borrowed the car to my parents often and my sister, a few months ago, had a surgery on her foot. After that she couldn't put her foot down, so she asked to use the car to go work. So we left the car with them for 3 months now. We could use the car on weekends, and had to get the car back by sunday night. It's been an ordeal, but it's been okay, my wife was bothered by that, but did set it aside. The thing that bothered us the most was the way my sister acted.

When she asked to borrow the car, she texted me ""hey, can I borrow the car for 6 months?"" which was a joke, but still rubbed me the wrong way.

From the on, the way she treated me and the car has been rough. The texts range from ""When you getting the car back here"" to ""hey, did you forgot I need the car?"". The entitlement was annoying everyone.

I've heard 3 sets of people talking about how they couldn't stand what it's happening.

Me and my wife have been able to save a little bit of money and bought a car in a good deal with a friend.

My MIL now said that they need the car back, so my plan of leaving my wife's car with my parents is out. My wife is also very much against us leaving the new car with them, for obvious reasons.

I do not feel safe leaving my dad without a car. I am afraid something happens, and there's no time for me get him to the hospital.

15,1fw4ruc,AITA I the asshole for arguing with my mom over her will?,"God this fucking sucks. 

I'm in my late 30's, the oldest of 3 kids, and my two younger siblings are both over 30.   
  
My middle brother disowned our family in his late teens when we pointed out his significant other was emotionally abusive and manipulative, only to go through a nasty divorce after discovering that same person was cheating on him.   
  
My youngest brother is married and has 4 children. He currently lives on the same property that I live on, that my mom and I purchased 50/50 back in 2019. He has literally never paid rent a day in his life, he's only ever worked part time, and his wife refuses to get/keep even a part-time job. I hate being that blunt, but it's just the truth. 

It's awful to be at a stage in life where you have to consider what life will be like when your parents are gone. My dad is already out of the picture. Middle brother, after getting 50% of a house his first partner essentially fully bought, in a divorce, now has a new partner and is very self-sufficient. Youngest brother has never been pushed to do better financially for himself or his family, and this is somewhat due to my mom. While she is not fully to blame for my brother's improvidence, she certainly has supported it by perpetually picking up the slack financially. There has been many fights between my mom and I in the past regarding his family living, rent-free, in a place that we could rent out as a side hustle. For the most part we had moved on past that issue.

In the last year or so she's revealed her plans for her house/farm, my childhood home, and it is to outright leave it to my youngest brother. She says that it is because he has children, which feels like a slight at my middle brother and I for being gay and more responsible with our life choices. I've tried telling her it feels like someone is being rewarded for proving that he will never strive to be financially stable.  I tried explaining to her that it seemed like she was conditioned to make this choice as my youngest brother always seems to come out of any situation smelling like a rose, and threatens to leave with her grandkids when he doesn't get his way.

My mom views leaving me her 50% of the property she and I purchased together as equal to leaving our childhood home/farm to my youngest brother. I've tried explaining that she's basically leaving me what would already be mine as ultimately I'd be responsible for the bills to keep ownership that property. Another very upsetting part of her plans is that my middle brother and I would likely either have to watch my other brother sell our childhood home to supplement his elective lack of income, or more likely we'd end up needing to share in paying the loan on a property that would belong wholly to the son that has historically contributed the least. 

I can't trick myself into not caring about this, and it makes me feel like my relationship with my mom is going to conclude with her doing something I really believe is wrong/cruel. ",No A-holes here,2024-10-04,"AITA I the asshole for arguing with my mom over her will? God this fucking sucks. 

I'm in my late 30's, the oldest of 3 kids, and my two younger siblings are both over 30.   
  
My middle brother disowned our family in his late teens when we pointed out his significant other was emotionally abusive and manipulative, only to go through a nasty divorce after discovering that same person was cheating on him.   
  
My youngest brother is married and has 4 children. He currently lives on the same property that I live on, that my mom and I purchased 50/50 back in 2019. He has literally never paid rent a day in his life, he's only ever worked part time, and his wife refuses to get/keep even a part-time job. I hate being that blunt, but it's just the truth. 

It's awful to be at a stage in life where you have to consider what life will be like when your parents are gone. My dad is already out of the picture. Middle brother, after getting 50% of a house his first partner essentially fully bought, in a divorce, now has a new partner and is very self-sufficient. Youngest brother has never been pushed to do better financially for himself or his family, and this is somewhat due to my mom. While she is not fully to blame for my brother's improvidence, she certainly has supported it by perpetually picking up the slack financially. There has been many fights between my mom and I in the past regarding his family living, rent-free, in a place that we could rent out as a side hustle. For the most part we had moved on past that issue.

In the last year or so she's revealed her plans for her house/farm, my childhood home, and it is to outright leave it to my youngest brother. She says that it is because he has children, which feels like a slight at my middle brother and I for being gay and more responsible with our life choices. I've tried telling her it feels like someone is being rewarded for proving that he will never strive to be financially stable.  I tried explaining to her that it seemed like she was conditioned to make this choice as my youngest brother always seems to come out of any situation smelling like a rose, and threatens to leave with her grandkids when he doesn't get his way.

My mom views leaving me her 50% of the property she and I purchased together as equal to leaving our childhood home/farm to my youngest brother. I've tried explaining that she's basically leaving me what would already be mine as ultimately I'd be responsible for the bills to keep ownership that property. Another very upsetting part of her plans is that my middle brother and I would likely either have to watch my other brother sell our childhood home to supplement his elective lack of income, or more likely we'd end up needing to share in paying the loan on a property that would belong wholly to the son that has historically contributed the least.

This would be normally disrespectful but recently said this to my son when went to his friend’s party.  When my son didn’t like the cake flavor and we had the discussion about how the birthday person gets to choose their cake flavor because it’s their special day. 

My MIL was shocked and I told her the same thing I told my son “when it’s your birthday you can get whatever flavor of cake you want” 

My MIL called me a bitch and my son a spoiled brat. So I told her “with that attitude you won’t be coming to the party” 

My Husband was wtf and tried to talk me into ordering his mom a cake she would enjoy after our son and I was “rude” to her. 

 I said no it isn’t her day and that just teaches our son to act entitled at other peoples parties if we don’t stick to the rules and etiquette that we explain to him and it will just make him confused, entitled, and spoiled. 

My husband saw the truth in that because our son was excited about his birthday cake for his birthday and now understands that not everything is about him. Other people get to enjoy their special event how they want to. In return my son gets to enjoy his special event and occasions how he wants to.

19,1fw3sk5,AITAH for confronting my roommate for basically making an insensitive comment when I was talking about my concerns and feelings,"
So basically I was having this talk with my roommates and it led to us talking about rent money. So this roommate is graduating after this year, I’m not I’m younger. So I was like I’m thinking of moving to a new house after this lease ends because idk I just felt like my rent price is a bit too high for me and not worth paying because I live in the basement and it’s a very tiny cold room. I felt like my other friends had much cheaper rents and were living on main floors and upstairs room which were bigger and just better than the room I have now. So I said that I’m thinking of moving out after this year. One of my roommates also lives in the basement with me and she was like “oh well I like my room”. And then this other roommate was like “how much are your paying?” And I’m like $800 which is quite expensive for my basement room. And she was like “ ok come on that’s not that bad”. And I was like “ok good for you that sounds cheap and you can afford it but for me it’s just a bit out of my price range recently so I’m planning on moving out”. And she and the other roommate just gave each other a dirty look about me and they were like “girl I never tried to say that” and I’m like “well whatever you were trying to say I didn’t ask you if you think it’s cheap or not for you” I’m just expressing my concerns and feelings about my room so I don’t think I can extend my lease once it’s done so I will be moving out to another place. And they kinda was just like ok and rolled their eyes. And then they started talking about what app they listen to music on and they both use Spotify and pay for that monthly subscription. Ok that’s fine, I didn’t say anything. So then she asked me, “ what app do you use?” And I kinda hesitated to say because I use YouTube lol and I know they might judge “ so before I even said it she was like “ omg do u use YouTube? Hahaha” and I’m like “uhh Yeahh lol” and she was like “mmhm yeah I used to be one of those girlies”. And sounded like she found that so unfortunate for me that I use YouTube. Like idk I just felt like they were judging the entire time about the stuff I do and feel like. I kinda just distance myself from them. Now whether IATAH or not I personally would never act the way they did with me, with anyone else. Not everyone lives the same life and can afford the same things and participates in the same things. Yes I don’t think what she said was rude but it’s def inappropriate to say that to someone who’s expressing their concern about how they think their rent is a bit too high for their room so they might move out once their lease ends. I just feel like my opinion isn’t neeeded in that conversation because not everyone feels the same way and shoving my opinion just might make the other person feel like they are broke and everyone around them can afford these things.

20,1fw3mda,AITA for not wanting to move in with my boyfriend? ,"I (29F) and my boyfriend (32M) have been together for over a year, and our relationship started beautifully. We each had our own apartments and maintained a perfect balance between togetherness and independence. However, things shifted when my sister went to Europe for two months this summer. We temporarily moved in together, which was helpful while I prepared for the LSAT, but some underlying issues started to surface.

Living together was mostly good—he was supportive and took care of my dog while I studied—but cracks started to appear. Just before my trip to Europe, we had a major argument over my decision to use ketamine recreationally, something I was open about. His strong reaction surprised me, and it led to him revealing pent-up frustrations, like feeling neglected while I focused on studying. It blindsided me, and we had to work through those emotions right before I left for my trip.

After I returned, we tried to move forward, but the underlying tension remained. I asked for more space, explaining that I valued my alone time to recharge, but he became more controlling and moody. Things escalated when we started exploring my bisexuality through a dating app for couples, only for me to discover he had been sexting someone behind my back. That breach of trust hit me hard.

While we tried to repair the relationship, the strain continued. He wanted to move in together full-time, but I wasn’t ready—and might never be. I realized how much I cherish my independence and having my own space. He, on the other hand, craved closeness, routines, and more shared time, which made me feel suffocated. Our needs seemed to be fundamentally at odds.

Despite our love for each other, I'm torn. I’ve reflected a lot on modern relationships and believe it’s possible to be in a committed partnership without living together. But for him, living together feels like the next step, and my hesitation is becoming a dealbreaker. We’re at a crossroads: either I sacrifice my independence or we rethink what our relationship looks like.

Ultimately, I’m wondering if our differences are too big to overcome. He doesn’t fully understand my need for space, and I can’t meet his needs for constant closeness without feeling overwhelmed.

21,1fw3gmt,AITA for not telling my bf the exact time of our plans,"Hi english is not my first language and I'm writing this right after it went down and it's my first time posting so I'm sorry if it's incoherent.

Me (f) and my bf (m) have been together for around 4 years. This monday I made plans with him and told him not to plan anything for Saturday evening/night (tomorrow).
The plan was an at home date were I was gonna cook special dinner and giving him a birthday gift that had arrived late. Also watching a movie or playing some games and having snacks or dessert, but I was gonna ask about his opinion today.
I first told him about the dinner plan on monday, and on wednesday I revealed that the gift had finally arrived and that he would receive it on saturday. On both days I told him that he would be busy the whole evening.

The problem is that last night during his night shift, his friends asked him to be their chauffeur for saturday night. He accepted without speaking to me about it and revealed it this afternoon after he woke up, which would have been fine if I hadn't told him to not make other plans.
I reminded him about the plan and he told me that he did not know the date would take place in the evening and that's why he accepted.
So in his version of the story I never told him that he would be busy from dinnertime and the whole evening. However I'm 100% sure I told him both Monday and Wednesday but I had no proof so it is his words against mine, and he doesn't believe me.
He thought that I had planned stuff only for dinner and before that, but that doesn't make sense since he works the night shift and wakes up at 4-5pm.

I feel like he should have talked to me about his invite even if I had forgotten to tell him how long he would be busy, since he at least remembered the dinner plans and gift giving. He feel like it is my responsibility to tell him because he can't ask about stuff he doesn't know about? Long story short, we fought about it and he blames me for not telling him the time, and I blame him for not remembering. I even told my mom about the plan because I was so excited. He thinks I only told the time to her and not to him.

He has a history of forgetting family plans, not just plans with me. But we can't come to a conclusion since I don't have proof of what I told him. In the future I shall write down the plans as proof, but I don't know, I feel like I shouldn't have to bring proof every time.

I'm a 20F in my second year of college, and over the past year, I’ve become close friends with my two roommates, who have been best friends for the past five years. The issue isn’t that we have different personalities—I’m an extrovert who loves going out to parties and socializing, while they’re more focused on their studies, which is fine. But recently, they’ve started guilt-tripping me into staying in and not attending college fests, making me feel like I’m selfish for leaving them alone.

26,1fw23e4,AITA for looking up my brother-in-law's girlfriend online?,"Hi. So, here is the story.

My brother-in-law (M23) has been online dating a woman he met in an MMO.

Cool, that's fine, right? What's the big deal?...The woman is a 40-year-old from Brazil.

My wife has been worried about this relationship for a while, especially now that her brother is planning to travel to see his girlfriend and stay with her for 4 months. He even hinted at the wish to live in Brazil with her.

She has been very suspicious of the matter. She has a ton of concerns about the possibility of him being catfished, or the issues due to the age gap, or that he might be taken advantage of, or that he might get scammed and sucked dry of what little money he has. She pretty much raised her brother and sees him as a very naive and sweet guy, and is afraid that he could end up in a dangerous situation in another country where he won't have anyone who could help him and in which he wouldn't even speak the language.

She has been talking with him, giving him advice, and voicing her concerns. But he always reassures her that he knows what he is doing, that it's not a catfishing situation, and that she shouldn't worry about it.

My wife didn't want to cross the line of looking this woman up online. So, I did it. I personally had no issue looking her up and told my wife that I would do it and if I found something suspicious I would tell her. My reasoning was that it was worth using publicly available information to judge if a person is trustworthy.

My first results weren't her social media accounts, it was 5 lawsuits against her, most of which involved legal issues with banks.

The rest of the things I found included an inconsistency regarding where she told my brother-in-law that she worked, he told us she worked IT at a logistics company, but she works IT at an industrial company, but this might have been due to his misunderstanding because of the language barrier, the confusion is so minor that I don't think this was a malicious thing. I also found out that she looks like an Onlyfans model which just made the whole catfishing thing even more possible to me. Her socials are all about her love of traveling, but she has 5 lawsuits issued by banks and apparently doesn't want to help my brother-in-law with travel expenses.

I told my wife who then spoke with her brother. He once again took it well, he appreciated her concerns and tried to reassure her again.

My wife decided that she had done enough to warn him, he is an adult and can make his own choices. However, her brother went on and told his girlfriend that we looked her up and she is now furious, claiming that we violated her privacy.

I maintain that we just checked out what's publicly available online. I can see why she would be upset. But I don't think I did something horrible.

27,1fw17at,WIBTA for not letting my flatmates’ friend stay for an unknown length of time? ,"(Throwaway account in the hopes of anonymity) 
Me and my wife moved in with another couple after emigrating to a different country whilst we settled into life here. They’ve recently flown back home due to a family member passing away, and the guy has just let us know that his partner will not be returning for several months, and asked us to reduce their part of the rent during that time. Whilst we were considering this, he then asked permission for their (m) friend (who we’ve never met) to stay in our flat for an undisclosed period of time, throwing in the fact this person could cover our other flatmate’s portion of the rent whilst she is away. 

We were hesitant about this for several reasons:
1. the rental market is crazy here and it’s highly unlikely this friend (a single guy with no job experience in the field he’s hoping on getting into once here) will find a place any time soon.
2. This person is also a total stranger to us (we don’t even know his last name). 
3. Me and my flatmate also have jobs which require us to be away from home, sometimes for up to two weeks at at time. This could mean that my wife could be living alone with this stranger whilst he is here, and she has understandable concerns about this (again, we do not know anything about this person). 
4. We don’t want our house to turn into a glorified youth hostel. This is not the first time friends of theirs have stayed for extended periods, and being married with flat mates plus extras on the couch is less than ideal. 
5. Our flat mates were planning on moving out in a few months, and we had said to family members visiting that we had space for them to stay at Christmas. However, it’s now looking like they won’t be out by December, and we’ll also have an additional body on the couch. 

I replied that we would have to think about it and asked when their friend would be arriving in the country. We expected this would be at least a month in the future, and planned on being able to chat to our flatmate in person to express our concerns when he gets back next week. However, when our flatmate got back to me he’s revealed that the friend is actually on the same flight as him.

(My wife is also annoyed because all of this has been playing out in private messages only to me and not in our group chat. Our flatmate obviously knows I’d consult her before deciding anything, but it’s still rude that he’s not properly included her in the discussion) 

So will I be the asshole if I say the friend can’t stay?

28,1fw0vka,AITA for not inviting my cousin's stepson to my wedding?,"I ( F30) got married last month. It was a small wedding  and mostly family and really close friends.

My family is quite big and so is my fiance's, and because the cost per person is very high  we had to cut some people, because we couldn't afford to pay for everyone. I was really sad for not inviting some people that were like family ( my mom's neighbours and their children who grew up with me, but they were 14 people and I had to compromise as we established that 70 was our limit).

  
About one week before the wedding my cousin (M32) ( who I only see once a year at Christmas and was invited because I'm very close with his mother) sent me a whatsapp message. I thought maybe he wouldn't be able to make it but I was wrong. His message said : "" Hey! You're counting with T, my girlfriend's son for the wedding right?"".  ( He is dating this women who is 10 years older than him and has a 20year old son who I only saw once).  
I told him that no, that we weren't counting on him ( the invitation only said his and his girlfiend's name) as he never went to any of the family gatherings and I don't really know him. He read my message and didn't reply, so I moved on.

  
Fast forward to the wedding day, my cousin arrives with his girlfriend and they don't speak to anyone. He didn't even congratulate us, but again I chose to ignore it. When we get to the reception they are still alone at a corner and when my family approaches them they start complaining about how I excluded her son from the family and they were behaving exactly like I have treated them. My aunts start saying that they are in the wrong and that they knew we had to exclude some important people from the wedding and that her son in not a dependent child, he is an adult. Things quickly escalate and they start yelling, I immediately go there and ask what's wrong and they start calling me an entitled b\* and a cunt and that I was being an a-hole to his girlfriend and that I should feel really terrible for excluding someone from my wedding. After being extremely rude they left the wedding ( we were still at the reception) and started saying really loud "" you're gonna pay for our seats you b\* and we are leaving and we're not gifting you"".

Everyone was chocked but at the end it seemed like my aunts and cousins were against me and saying that it was just another person and that it kinda feels like I am saying that her son is not part of the family as he wasn't invited to this family event ( but again he is not my family and I have only seen him once years ago).

We were really tight growing up, but went different paths as adults and our friendship these days is mostly due to longevity and association with the other two guys. Mike is not a bad guy by any means but we have the least in common and he is always talking/complaining about how expensive things are, especially with weddings when our other two friends in the group got married.

Last summer when another of the guys got married, he complained so much about having to pay for the groomsman suit that was about $250. He also complained about the bachelor party being out of town (like most bach parties Ive been to), and at the wedding itself talked about how weddings are such a waste for one day.

34,1fvyix5,"AITA for telling my friend that her wedding plans are currently ""unrealistic""?","My (30F) friend (35F) recently got engaged and I'm absolutely thrilled for her. She has spoken previously before she was engaged that her and her partner want to elope in a different (more expensive) country. I have always supported her in this and am a big believer in your wedding your rules.


The problem arises when she got engaged and said she can't wait for elopement wedding, I took her aside and said that I may not be able to come due to finances, she responded that there will be plenty of time to save for the wedding (they plan to do it in 2026) and that the cost is ""what you make of it"" and that it can always be made into a holiday for the guests so they are not just flying 12ish hours for the wedding. 

The country and city she plans to elope is not my favourite place in the world, somewhere I have little interest in visiting and so I wouldn't make a holiday out of it. If I was going to attend I'd attend only for the wedding and then return home.

Fast forward 6 months and the planning has started and they have invited 40ish people to come to the wedding, stating that they know other people who have eloped and have had 20 to 30 guests. I made a comment that I believe that is an unrealistic expectation as it is lot of cost to ask people and that she should be prepared that all 40 people might not come, in fact it could be significantly less. She immediately got defensive. Stating that she isn't being unreasonable and almost saying that then cost would be the same for guests at a home wedding. Which I totally disagree on but didn't want to make the situation worse. She is aware there will be some people who say no, I'm a very close friend to her and I think she is more hurt that I'm implying I might not be able to make it.

From what I know so far the couple aren't planning to pay any expenses apart from maybe one meal after the wedding. 

Ever since my friend has been quiet and cold and I want to know if I maybe have said too much and should have just politely declined attending the wedding. I am still trying to see if I can make the cost work because I would love to go, but it is an awful lot of money for me (2.5k being generous).

My oldest sibling (then 14M) was not in the car. For a while, my brother was in foster care (albeit a good situation). I moved heaven and earth to get him with me as soon as possible. 

We received substantial life insurance proceeds and an even more substantial settlement (accident was caused by a truck driver). We also sold my mom's home. With my half of the money, I bought a large home for my brother and I . The other half of the money is in a trust for my brother. 

A couple of years later, I got a casual hookup pregnant (""GF""). We ended up having identical twin boys. I was not interested in a romantic relationship, although excited to be a dad. She convinced me to try and make the relationship work ""for the boys."" I agreed to try. She was making little money and couldn't afford rent. So, I let her, with my brother's permission, move into the house. She decided she wanted to stop working and stay home with the boys. I was against it. But, after reading up on the benefits for kids, I agreed.

Here is where I might be the AH. Due to some bad circumstances,  three years ago, two of my GF's siblings ended up in foster care. The situation is quite bad from what I was told. My GF understandably wants to adopt/foster them. But, given the living situation (she has no income, no ownership in the home, etc), she cannot do it on her own. So, either I would need to do it and/or we get married so we can do it together. I absolutely refuse. Look, I am willing to let the kids live here if she somehow could get approved on her own, but I would not do what she is asking. This has been an ongoing fight and she has called me an AH. She says I moved heaven and earth to get my brother out of a good foster family, and her siblings are going through hell and I won't help. I said, I had a duty to my brother. While she has a duty to her siblings, I do not have a duty to them. Our mutuals are pretty divided and she knows my main account. So, I am here to get more perspectives.

We are in a group of about 6 dudes. We all love to hang out and just play videogames and go out for a beer. Simple guy stuff. 

Myself, our other friend Sean, and Jake haven't had the best luck with women. 

Jake specifically. He was in love with one girl in our friend group for like over 5 years and she always friend zoned him. he was always obsessing over her and she would give him small hints. And it got really rocky in our friend group when one of our other buddy's ended up messing around with her. But the beef got squashed eventually. 

So fast forward to a year ago, Jake meets this girl Diana on a dating app. He had been on it months prior with no luck at all. Then all of a sudden, a pretty attractive girl matches with him and he's ecstatic. I mean he's not super ugly but he has a lot of unattractive qualities about him so it was shocking. I love bro tho. 

He was trying to play it cool, ask us for advice. He literally matched with her in Sean's house. He was shaking. I was like calming down dude and we were happy for him. 

A few weeks pass, and he's still talking to her. I nicely tried to tell him ""what if it's a catfish dude"" yet he swore it wasn't. And he ended up being right. 

But Diana has a lot of issues. Her family life is messed up. She has issues. PTSD I guess.  She's ok. But she seems kind of not interested in us when we all went to the bar together. Jake said it's because ""it was all dudes talking dude stuff"" but really? She can't even make an effort? 

She has everything put together. Lives on her own from a young age.  Decent job. We all live at home with our parents. 
So one time when he was leaving out hangout early to drive an hour to her place, I got bummed cuz we never see him every day anymore. And he asked what? 
I said ""dude I love you but don't you think this whole thing has been sus? She wants you there all the time. With all her history, do you think maybe she got desperate?""

Around 15 mutual friends and 10 of my friends were invited. 

Now, I have always maintained I hate surprises and that I want to know things in advance. I have mild social anxiety and hate having things kept from me. Also, it’s not the way I enjoy things.

My girlfriend loves surprises. She did not believe someone won’t enjoy a “nice” surprise. When she teased the idea of surprising me, I was always unequivocal in communicating it’s not something I want.

Nonetheless, she went all out. Go-karting. Dinner at a great restaurant. My house decorated to the max for the party. Cake, balloons, confetti. 

My anxiety was building steadily from the first activity to the last. I was strung from location to location. Everyone knew the plan, the next location, except for me. I hated every bit. 

I had an internal conflict because I know these are all objectively “nice” things but I couldn’t help that I was hating every second while having to pretend to all my friends I’m having the best time. I didn’t want to be a killjoy and appear ungrateful.

Throughout the day I kept imploring her to give me more details of the plans but she didn’t want to spoil the surprise. It all came to a head when I gauged that we’re heading back to our place for the party. It sounds silly, but my room was untidy and the anxiety spike from knowing people will see it sent me over the edge.

I said some unkind things to her; questioned if she even knew me and that I hated it all. I told her this in private, I didn’t cause a scene in front of others. 

I tried to smooth things over after, as I recognised I reacted out of frustration/anger but she was understandably upset. 

She thinks I’m ungrateful, rude and diminished her efforts. I think I was driven to this by a set of events I was clear I didn’t want.

My son recently had a birthday and my brother got mad at me because I decided not to continue waiting on him  to sing happy birthday and have cake. 
I live in a different state with a three hour difference where my family lives. My brother called in the morning to ask when we would be giving my son cake and I had said around 6:45pm our time because we initially had a sport practice scheduled.

40,1fvxlqz,AITA for not telling my mother how I feel about her actions?,"I (15 f) am the oldest of my mother's three children. My father is strict yet open-minded, but my mother is very judgemental, so much so that I feel uncomfortable/scared expressing my thoughts in front of her. For example: She was judging my schoolmates for wearing shirt skirts but I (discreetly) wanted to be dressed the same way.

She does not let me shave my arms and legs and I am very insecure about it but I am too scared to tell her that. Also, she is a very beautiful woman with a great sense of style but when it comes to me, she almost dresses me as a child. I also do not own a phone of my phone and my first cousins have made fun of me for that (they are not much older than me and they are my parental cousins), my friend suggested me to sneak and make an IG account but I am too scared. I feel like I am losing my teenage years to her strict self.

She is also kind of (IDK maybe I am imagining stuff) biased to my brother (10) but idk if it is because he is youngest or because he is the only boy, but he gets away with a lot of shit. (like many other men in my community). For example: She asked me to give up my snacks to my cousin (a bloody toddler) because I am the oldest but I already have bought the least amount of snacks for myself because I wanted others to buy themselves extra stuff. That made me cry.

Then, she went to the market with my aunt. My aunt offered to buy keychains for me and my siblings. She got two for my siblings but when my aunt asked what about me, she replied that I am too old. (She told me this herself).

I usually help her out with some chores but if she gets even slightly mad at something I did and then if I offer to help, she would yell at me and make my sister do the chores instead. I feel like that is a way of showing me that she does not need me or whatver but yeah, it hurts.

And the thing is, I don't feel this way entirely about her. I could talk to her about stuff like alcohol and drugs and how those stuff are bad but then again, I feel like she would judge me.

AITA to make a big deal about it? I feel like shit to feel this way about my mother.

PS: She once said that I am jealous of her in front of her bestfriend/ second cousin (they both were looking at me with a smirk-y kinda way) and after a few days, I started crying about it. She dismissed it as a joke and said that I was sensitive.

42,1fvxkns,WIBTA For reducing contact with my polycule friend group?,"So I've been hanging out with a particular friend group for \~4 years now. They're all good people and I really like them. We're all autistic and/or ADHD women and they're the first group of neurodivergent friends I've ever had. After a lifetime of struggling to connect with friends I never realised how much easier it would be to socialise with other neurodivergent people but I click with them really well.  
  
Recently they've started to morph into a giant polycule. They all date each other now. I had no issues with them dating and I'm happy for them but the group has become very centred around their sexual relationships with each other. 

Every time we meet up they cuddle together, flirt, kiss and talk about sex/bdsm stuff they're doing with each other. I don't really like cuddling with my platonic friends that much and I find overly doing public displays of affection a little bit cringe. I just end up sitting there awkwardly as the only one not involved in the cuddlefest so the last few times we've hung out I ended up joining in despite not really wanting to. They also keep inviting me to do sexual / bdsm things with them which I politely decline.

We have a group chat as well that has largely started to revolve around flirting and hornyposting which I'm also not interested in.

Basically I'm finding that hanging out with this group isn't particularly fun anymore but feel guilty that maybe I'm just being a prude or something.

They’ve pissed everywhere because they’re territorial male cats and she can’t afford to get them fixed and our apartment smells like shit because she can’t afford to top off their litter boxes, since 3 cats produce 3x as much shit. She’s apparently nose blind, meaning she could be home the whole time theyre pissing on my stuff and wont do anything about it. There was one weekend where we were all away except her, and we came back to a rancid apartment because they pissed in the kitchen, living room, my room, my sister’s room. we had to throw out rugs, a futon, a bunch of my clothes are destroyed, and the floor under my bed was soaked. i had to take two days off work to clean the apartment, mopping every surface with vinegar multiple times. that was when she moved in, in august. now things are better, because we keep our doors closed and the cats have adjusted to the space. 

but even now, getting her to clean or take responsibility is like pulling teeth. she refuses to sweep or clean unless she’s forced to so our floor is constantly covered in litter crumbs. she can’t afford a decent amount of litter to even fill their boxes so she wants us to buy “deodorizer” to top off when the smell bothers us. we’ve had to make her a sign-in sheet just so she can remember to clean the litter 3x a day but the apartment still STINKS. our brand new couch my mom bought us as a gift is shredded cuz she cant afford a cat tree. and the third cat is only a couple months old so it will get worse as he gets older. re-homing the cats is not even an option for her, and we all want out of this situation desperately. she’s not on the lease, the landlord doesn’t know theres cats here, she hasnt paid the pet fee, and our 4th roommate hates her and the cats. 

I might be TA from the way I’m talking about the situation. She’s genuinely attached to her pets and they’ve grown on me too, and things have been improving since we’ve had roommate talks and with no accidents in the past month. I’m holding power over her cuz the room is under my name and its my fault for inviting her to move in. She’s technically meeting her end of the deal which was “clean litter 2x a day”, since she’s now doing 3x a day but its still not enough. 

I’m just over holding her hand through everything and playing mediator through all these repetitive house meetings trying to get her to do the bare minimum. On top of that, her presence is overwhelming and with the cats the house is no longer a comfortable place to call home. i did consider being the one to move out but its my name on the lease and she cant afford the room without me anyways. besides, she still owes me first month’s rent since i decided to help her out when she didnt have a job.

Luke’s GF - Brie
(These are fake names btw)

So my boyfriend and I have been together for more than 2 years now; we are in a long-distance relationship and honestly haven’t met yet, but we’re already planning this December. His younger brother met a girl from Indonesia, which honestly made me excited because I am Asian as well. They've been together for 7 months now, but me and her just recently started talking. She seems nice and genuine, and I honestly like her vibes. Everything was smooth at first, but then I found out that she moved out just recently from her parent’s house, and Luke was the one paying for her apartment. I thought maybe Luke was just trying to help her out since she just recently moved out. We still continued talking for days until she mentioned that Luke is the one paying for everything, including her food, makeup, skincare, and more. They’re also planning to meet, and Luke will shoulder all of the expenses. I thought that was all of it, but she started telling me about how Luke will pay for everything and make her move to US and will even support her studies since she’s planning to study again. It's honestly not an issue to me if Luke willingly does it, but the thing is she gets mad and upset every time Luke refuses to give her something she wants. I honestly don’t know what to feel because me and my boyfriend’s relationship is very different from theirs. I am currently in university studying medicine, and my parents set up funds for my studies so I don't really need my boyfriend to pay for anything; I won't let him as well because it's not his responsibility. We'll be meeting soon, and he said he will shoulder everything (I will not let him, but he doesn't know that, lol). Anyway, I feel really uncomfortable with the situation, and I feel like I should tell my boyfriend about what is happening because, at the end of the day, that's his brother. But at the same time I am torn because I don't want to ruin Luke and Brie's relationship just because I have a different opinion about the whole setup of their relationship. so WIBTA?
Additional info: My boyfriend and his brother are not rich. And my boyfriend also mentioned how Luke is recently always short on money, and he doesn't know why. I know why though😭

47,1fvw2cl,WIBTA if i approached my new coworker about her drinking outside work?,"I (45F) manage a team of about 15 people. The team has a new hire (let’s call her Marge) that came to us with lots of good experience. Marge had to move from a different city to accept the position, and I hooked her up with a house sitting gig so she could have temporary housing while she looked for a permanent housing. The house sitting gig was for my good friend (we’ll call her Jessica). 

Well, Marge missed the deadline for her first major project. By a lot. Looking back, there were some red flags—forgetting to send drafts, not saving documents in the correct files, etc. it was a big deal, and I ended up having to do major portions of the project last minute to make up for what she hadn’t done. 

Well, unbeknownst to her, I’ve now heard stories about what Marge is like outside of work. It mostly involves copious amount of alcohol, including walking out on a pretty big tab at Jessica’s favorite bar—one of the bartenders approached Jessica once she was back in town to see if Marge was still around in hopes of getting that tab paid. 

There’s no way to prove Marge missed her deadline because of her drinking, but I’m fairly certain it’s the reason. Plus leaving the tab and getting Jessica involved is outrageous. 

So, WIBTA if I told Marge I know about her drinking and suggest it’s affecting her work? 


ETA: Performance was addressed. Several conversations were had about the missed deadline, both by me and my boss, with her. One of the things we brought up multiple times was we offered help throughout the process, and she always told us she was good. She knows we are changing the workflow for next time to make sure this doesn’t happen again. And (hopefully) she understands that she got a pass because she’s new, and she won’t get that pass next time around.

48,1fvvrap,AITA for wanting my husband to stop smoking weed,"I (42F) have asked my husband (54M) to smoke less weed. He works full time, he provides for us, he looks after us, he is -mostly- a loving, caring, funny guy. We are totally in love. We adore each other. During Covid lockdowns he began to drink heavily, he continued to do this even after Covid (and by heavily I mean 2 bottles of wine an evening and more than a 1 litre bottle of Gin a week). It got to the point where he started having health issues, fatty liver, liver pain, really bad symptoms, he went on a cycle of giving up the booze for a few weeks and then he'd start up again. But it got to the point where the liver pain was too much and he gave up drinking completely. He has depression and takes anti-depressants and he was using alcohol as a way of dealing with his bad days, when he could no longer drink he started smoking weed. At first it was just at the weekends. But it progressed and he started smoking weed first thing when he woke up, and when he was working from home he'd smoke at lunchtime and then he'd smoke all evening. 

I'm not working at the moment. I got made redundant last year. I've had my own health issues and have quite severe anxiety, I've also had some perimenopause issues that resulted in a hysterectomy this year and now things are getting better, I'm starting a new job in a couple of weeks and things are on the up!

Over the last few months I have raised the issue of him being stoned all the time, I don't want to live with someone who is stoned all the time. I asked him if it was possible that he could smoke at the weekends and not during the week. Which he did but that soon meant that he was stoned the entire weekend, from the minute he woke up. 

We had some big discussions, about what his habits were doing to us as a couple. He acknowledged that he used alcohol as a coping mechanism and is now doing the same with the weed. I have talked to him about therapy, he says he will try therapy but then does nothing, I have researched and found various therapists and resources to support him but he doesn't do anything with these. I have made my views super clear: I don't want him to not smoke weed at all but I do want it to be a fun weekend thing that he does rather than something he does all the time. And I've also said that if he wants a life where he is just stoned all the time, he can have that but it won't be a life that includes me. I didn't sign up for this. He is different when he's on weed. I want to live with the man I married, the man that I adore, the man that I love so much.

Today he took a day off work and we planned a really nice day together, nothing super special just a bit of shopping and lunch, just the 2 of us.

49,1fvunl7,WIBTA if I brought up my recently deceased grandmothers life insurance policy that named me and my siblings as beneficiaries right after the funeral?,"My grandmother died on the 2nd at the age of 84. Despite her old age, I did not expect her to go so soon after being put on hospice and her death has really been a shock to us all. She was healthy for the most part, never smoked or drank. I thought she'd live to be close to 100. But alas, her funeral will be the day after tomorrow and I am going to miss her very much.

Now I know how distasteful it is for someone in my position to be overly concerned with money. But I am financially struggling right now and trying to make ends meet while working a menial job. My grandmother always wanted to leave something for me and my siblings as we were her only grandkids. She had me and my brother listed as POD on her savings account until my dad became her financial POA and changed it to his and her account. 

After my dad became her financial POA, she was, in her very characteristic way, not happy that he had taken away what she intended to leave for my siblings and I. So her response was to change the beneficiaries on her life insurance policy to my brother, my sister and myself. Let me make clear that my dad has a good job that pays well, lives in a nice house with a pool, nice car ,and is in no way shape or form ""strapped for cash"". I was a great student, had my eyes set on college and a career, but shortly after HS fell into a depression that led me down a dark path. I have heard many times from him ""what a waste"" and ""what a shame, you had so much potential"". And I wont lie, I did. It hurts to think about where I could be right now had I got my head in the right place and just trucked on. 

I can definitely see him reacting negatively to any mention of any possible inheritance and chalking it up to me wanting free money. But my grandmother expressed her desire to leave us something way before she became senile. 

Would it be the end of the world if I am to forgo any payout or inheritance as a result of my grandmothers passing? Of course not.

We've had two big fights throughout our friendship. The first argument was about my best friend's ex, which I didn't like and our friendship took a hit because of it. Another argument was when my best friend bluntly told me how I'm too loud for anyone to want to date me and compared me to his ""girl next door"" girlfriend. Despite everything, we are best friends and have talked things through and forgiven each other.

  
About a week ago we were out with a small group of friends. The beginning of the evening went without any problems and everyone had a lot of fun. At the end of the night, we ended up in a quiet pub, where my best friend pulled me aside and started crying. She told me how she felt bad that she didn't contact me during the time of her breake up with her ex (this happened about 5 years ago) and how it's the most selfish thing she's ever done. How she only thinks good of others and lives her life for everyone else (this is not true, for example she cheated on her ex because she didn't dare to leave her).



I told her that it's pointless to cry about it now that so much time has passed and everything between us is fine. She just kept whining about it, so I tried to reason and asked if she would have answered me if something terrible had happened during the time she wasn't in contact with me, for example someone close to me had died. She said yes, in this case she would have contacted me. So I assured her that she was a good friend and we worked it out. And I reminded her that she had the right not to be in contact with me and mourn the end of a relationship that was important to her.



She did not calm down and continued to cry and brought up other age-old issues that were unrelated to each other and didn\`t involve me.

55,1fvtlt0,AITA My girlfriend wants to be inebriated every night.,"So my GF (20F) and I (24M) have been dating for a couple months. We've handled several rocky moments as any starting relationship does. I've lately noticed something that is slowly building to really get on my nerves. 

Every night she wants some form of inebriation. Most nights she takes a THC gummy, which makes her very goofy but also she apparently is no longer capable of functioning on her own. She loses track of her vape, her phone, and anything else she currently has around her. 

Meanwhile, I'm either operating somewhere else in the house or playing games. I'm constantly being interrupted and asked where her stuff is, even though I haven't had anything to do with it. 

In other circumstances, she asks me to get her something from the kitchen, which on its own isn't an issue. But then I come back and ask if she needs anything else, to which she replies no, so I then proceed to start a game, and am then asked to go get something else from the kitchen or somewhere else in the house. 

I feel like I don't get to sit down for more than a minute without being asked something or asked to do something. None of this happens when she's sober. Only after she has inebriated herself and becomes practically nonfunctional. 

AITA For getting frustrated about the situation.

 (For clarification, I have smoke and drank, I'm not a fan of being ""out of control"" and tend to only partake in social situations and even then I limit how much so I'm still aware of my faculties.)

I normally come home from work, we shower together, I'll either start some laundry or sit in the kitchen while she cooks dinner, we watch TV while we eat or sit at the table and talk about the day. 

It isn't until about 9pm. that I get on any game. And on a weekday, I only play until about 10, because then we both wind down and go to bed because I have to be up at 6:30 for work.

So my GF (20F) and I (24M) have been dating for a couple months. We've handled several rocky moments as any starting relationship does. I've lately noticed something that is slowly building to really get on my nerves. 

Every night she wants some form of inebriation. Most nights she takes a THC gummy, which makes her very goofy but also she apparently is no longer capable of functioning on her own. She loses track of her vape, her phone, and anything else she currently has around her. 

Meanwhile, I'm either operating somewhere else in the house or playing games. I'm constantly being interrupted and asked where her stuff is, even though I haven't had anything to do with it. 

In other circumstances, she asks me to get her something from the kitchen, which on its own isn't an issue. But then I come back and ask if she needs anything else, to which she replies no, so I then proceed to start a game, and am then asked to go get something else from the kitchen or somewhere else in the house. 

I feel like I don't get to sit down for more than a minute without being asked something or asked to do something. None of this happens when she's sober. Only after she has inebriated herself and becomes practically nonfunctional. 

AITA For getting frustrated about the situation.

 (For clarification, I have smoke and drank, I'm not a fan of being ""out of control"" and tend to only partake in social situations and even then I limit how much so I'm still aware of my faculties.)

56,1fvtkmt,AITA for telling my husband he and his mother ruined out wedding day for me?,"I (35F) got married to my husband (M41) recently.

Neither of us like the spotlight so agreed on a small event. The only thing I was firm about was I didn’t want photos. 

My self esteem is in the toilet. In the last 18months I have put on weight. 
I am not looking to make excuses but there are some reasons why.

  1. In the last 18moths I have lost both parents and my grandmother. I have lost 2 jobs and had a miscarriage. Depression has hit me hard at times and I have been comfort eating.

2. I was put on a new medication and weight gain is a side effect.

3. About a year ago I broke my left ankle badly. I have had 3 surgeries to date (the last one was 10days before the wedding). I can’t walk without pain

I really didn’t want photos that would remind me of the fact I am now fat.

Few weeks before the wedding my mother in law is talking about going to a local beauty spot for photos. I say no thank you and that yes I am being serious. My husband hears this and later that night I say again I really don’t want photos and he says that is fine with him.

Week before the wedding I am having the same conversation with MIL and my husband. 

Day of the wedding my FIL and MIL pick us up. I am no longer able to drive as I can’t move my ankle.

We get the whole legal shindig done and as we are going back to the car MIL again says let’s go to the beauty spot for photos. I again so no but she tells FIL to drive there and my husband just sits there.I know I gave him “the look” but total silence.

Long story short the photos are taken and we head back. 

In the car driving home my MIL starts showing me the photos and I hate myself in them. I look like a pile of fat shit. I look ridiculous in a dress with a medical boot and I can’t stop the tears rolling down my cheeks.

This upsets my mother in law and there is an atmosphere the whole rest of the day. I really tried to move on, but I had to get out of that stupid dress and all I really just wanted to hide away.

Privately I told my husband him and his mother ruined our wedding day for me because all I can think of is those pictures. He said he didn’t realise I was so serious about no photos, that it’s only for his mum to keep and that he thinks I look beautiful. 

I told him that not 30mins into our marriage he totally let me down and I don’t know if I am beyond hurt or furious.  

He said I was being ridiculous and that I let him down by making such a fuss over a “normal part of weddings”. He also said I had hurt his mother (she has some mental health issues and has been obsessing over me crying on my wedding day) and that I need to reassure her she hasn’t done anything wrong.

I told him no and there will be serious problems if he tries telling her otherwise because as far as I am concerned they both totally ignored my one request and that was unacceptable.

He thinks I am being a totally unreasonable AH.

So am I being an AH reddit?


UPDATE - 

With all the comments saying I disregarded my husband’s wishes on his wedding day I asked him directly “did you want those photos and just said you didn’t appease me?” 

Before you all pile on (again) there is no reason he would not answer truthfully.

He replied that he did not care about the photos MIL took in the woods. He said having seen them they are objectively bad (he clarified poorly taken on a shitty phone) not something he would want to keep and not worth the distress caused.

He said the only photo he would want was one of the look on my face staring up at him when we said the “I dos”. He joked that he should have strapped a go-pro to his forehead to capture that but he doesn’t NEED a photo to remember it.

I would not have been against that idea because it would have been private between just us.

He cannot give a reason for being silent in the car. MIL has a server mental disorder and I believe there is fear around setting her off on a spiral. 

I explained how ambushed I felt and that I only got out of the car to try and keep the peace. That really upset him. He apologised for not speaking up. I think he understands the main issues were not being supported and feeling helpless. 

Everybody saying I should have not got out - I am sure you would call me the AH for throwing a childish tantrum refusing to leave the car if I post that scenario. I was in a lose lose situation. 

I apologised for letting my insecurities become part of our marriage. He hadn’t realised just how deep my issues run. I am guilty of putting on a brave face so I can’t blame him for that.

We don’t want any drama. I am not going to hold a grudge against MIL. This is the first time there has ever been an issue like this in our family. Husband will talk to her but not about my insecurities. He suggested asking her to delete the photos but I said we both know he would have to die on that hill. We are going to move past the whole thing. However, I don’t know what to do if she makes them public.

We both agree that what matters is our 9 year long relationship that is now a marriage and not a single day where some papers were signed. I am sure that comment is going to upset a lot of people who feel a wedding day should be a magical life changing event but it is how WE view OUR lives together, nothing to do with your feelings.

I wouldn’t put our relationship/marriage on hold because times are tough so why would I put this one day off?

We are not American and marriage is not such a big deal here. Many couples never marry and that is very normal. Since before everything happened our main reason for getting married was so I could legally use his protected surname.

This is why we just went to the registry office and it was 8 people in attendance.

I apologise for my fatphobic language. Growing up in the 90’s with a mother with an ED has clearly had an effect on how I view bodies and I need to work on that. 

I have had counselling for feelings around my loss of mobility which has naturally touched on the other issues in my life but I am going to speak to my doctor about more specialised grief counselling going forward.

58,1fvtah4,"AITA for contributing to my son's 529 plan, but not my stepdaughters ","I (40F) have been married to my wife (39F) for 12 years. I have 2 stepdaughters (22 and 18) who were 7 and 3 when we started dating. My wife and I have a son together, who is 10.

When our son was born I started a 529 plan for him for future college expenses. My father and I make monthly contributions and it is close to $27k. My wife does not contribute to it at all. Around the same time, at my suggestion, my wife started a 529 plan for my 18 yo stepdaughter. However, she does not contribute as much and it's only at about $5k.

Recently we've been doing some financial planning and my wife became aware of how much I've saved for our son. She is upset saying it's not fair to my stepdaughters that they don't have as much money for college. The 22 yo is on/off at a JC and the 18yo is a senior in HS. She believes it's going to cause issues of them believing they're being treated unfairly because I'm saving for our son and not my stepdaughters. 

Throughout our relationship I've always helped financially support my stepdaughters. They've played competitive sports,  and we've taken international trips almost yearly together. Their father never consistently had a relationship with them and owes over $50k in child support. Occasionally, around back to school he'd drop a few hundred dollars for clothes, or pay the 22 yo's car payment. So basically, I was covering the costs when their father refused to. 

While i love my stepdaughters, they do have a father who is capable of contributing.  When our son was born, my priorities did shift because I wanted to ensure our son would be set in the future. Does that make me an AH?

**Update: My wife and I keep separate accounts, and she sends me money every month to pay our bills, mortgage, etc. It's not that we don't communicate about finances, or she didn't know about the account, she just doesn't pay attention. Hence why i handle the monthly bills. While I make more than her on paper, I only bring home about $400 more a month. I carry insurance for our family and contribute to our HSA account, so she can get a kick back. 

Re: child support, if/ when bio dad has a job my wife will get payments. Last week it was $37.

59,1fvsyhb,AITA for not being excited after my friend told me he got a divorce settlement ," My (37F) have a friend (34M) who recently settled for divorce. Long story, lots of unnecessary input and influence of in-laws, and down the drain goes a 10 year relationship.  They are cordial, but there is significant resentment. Both families thought they were bad for each other, which is genuinely don’t think they were at the beginning. But over time, their unsupportive families caused an irreparable rift between them. 

They have a lot of shared assets, and had no clear plan of division, so a lengthy court case was inevitable. They make approximately the same amount of money, but in their relationship, he spent most of their frivolous money. Most of their possessions were things he wanted, and he bought with their money. She does not buy many things.

By the end of the case, their possessions ended up getting divided 50/50, which i guess is fair, but so was their joint bank account. I believe that most of the money in that account came from her. He spent most of his contributions on video games, consoles, and toys, basically. I personally think she got the short end of the deal. She got a bunch of his garbage that she didn’t want, and lost a lot of money she earned due the account being split half way. 

I made my feelings about how unfair this was for her very clear to my friend when he told me about it. He told me that he understood that he got the better end of the deal, but that I should still be happy for him, because this was good for him. He called me ass, and told me I should be more supportive of my friend, and not his ‘manipulative’ ex.  

I don’t want to celebrate the misfortune of someone who’s never wronged me. And i have a hard time celebrating my friend’s legal victory if it is at the expense of someone who is not evil or conceited.

It is clearly marked by street signs, and I make sure anyone who visits my house is aware.  However, recently I had to rent a 20' U-haul to pick up some heavy and large material for a home project.  I parked it on my side of the street (the illegal side) intending to unload and move away in \~20 minutes.  Welp, 20 minutes turned into just under an hour, and as I'm walking back out to take the truck back to where I rented it, a neighbor driving by honked.  She didn't see me walking back because I was still behind my house, but I could see her, and there was no other foreseeable reason to honk.

I would have literally blocked traffic for a bit if I had parked on the correct side because my helper and I struggled moving the stuff even a few feet at a time.  Also, a 20' truck would have been difficult for me to get into my single car wide driveway without rolling in my or my neighbors grass.

fast forward to now she just found out i lied + never ordered it and she’s super mad at me which is actually really annoying because every time i’ve gotten her a gift before, it’s gone one of two ways: she immediately hates it or she loves it at first and then hates it after a few days. i just know that it would’ve gone the same way with the necklace. she’d probably adore it at first but then maybe a week later she’d get mad at me for something and probably rip it off her neck and then i’ll have thrown away $100 for nothing other than to keep her in a good mood for a few extra days. now i don’t know if i should just buy her the necklace now & waste money or endure her current bad mood.

65,1fvrhe7,"AITA for making an insensitive comment, if I didn’t know?","I (30F) have a childhood friend Anna (29F) who survived stage IV cancer. Anna and I haven’t lived close to each other in years. However, when Anna was diagnosed with cancer almost 3 years ago, I found myself always trying to be the supportive friend. Checking in on Anna via text message or Instagram DMs? Sending Anna funny memes, just trying to be someone she could come to if she needed a listening ear. 

Anyway, earlier this week Anna shared a story on social media about how expensive one of her follow-up appointments would be— almost $6K+ after insurance coverage. 

Before I continue I am well aware now that I truly put my foot in my mouth here. However, not knowing any better at the time as I have a co-worker, named Sarah (50F) who regularly makes this joke. Sarah is also a cancer survivor (Stage III Breast Cancer).

I proceeded to make the rather dark joke to Anna - “Just remember your debt can’t follow you forever.” At the time I had made this joke to Anna under the impression and knowledge of my coworker (Sarah, 50F) that medical debt was not something you passed on to family members. 

Of course, Anna was upset and rather confused by this comment and I understand why now. 

I proceeded to continue to tell Anna about my coworker Sarah and that it is a comment Sarah tends to make as Sarah had also survived cancer. 

Anna was rather offended and rightfully so… responding immediately with how weird and inappropriate that was — and then proceeding to inform me that medical debt does in fact go on to your next of kin which would be her older brother. Yes, I realize now that I shouldn’t have said anything at all and that people do in fact die from cancer — leaving behind medical debt.

I started to write up my apology message to Anna on Facebook, when I realized she blocked me. 

I was able to send out my apology message over Instagram: “I realize you will probably never see this after I was blocked on Facebook. I just wanted to end with saying I am truly sorry and I realize now how incredibly stupid and insensitive my comment was. I’m sorry that cancer has to be this horrible thing that unfortunately bankrupts you for life because it shouldn’t have to be that way. The fact that you survived and that you are doing the right things to continue to stay healthy shouldn’t have to cost so much. I get it if we never talk again, but I just wanted to say you taught me something today that I never truly realized. Because I genuinely took my coworker’s comment as truth — and then to share it was just so incredibly stupid and insensitive. I am sorry! I do hope someday our healthcare system figures out a way to not bankrupt us.” 

Anna did proceed to block me on Instagram after this message was sent and I doubt she read it. I am tempted to send her a text apologizing, but I feel that would just be rude and more harassment than anything at this time.

We ran in similar circles back home, and then I barely saw him talk to anyone.  He doesn’t have an active phone number  and I have never heard him call anyone, even on an app. He had two different women over, but that was it. Maybe 6 or 7 times for both of them. No friends, no family.

When getting this apartment, he never got proof of his income. I was working two jobs and doordashed to make the 1/3 income minimum. He never put any utilities in his name, everything is in mine. His name is on the lease but because he couldn’t provide proof of his income he was listed as my son, and I had to correct it with the leasing office. He’s in his mid 30’s. 

I’ve made attempts to have him spend time outside of his room with some success. If I gave him a beer while watching a movie or UFC he’ll watch with me, but I stopped drinking a while ago. We’ve had maybe 4 face to face interactions this year. If I had friends, my ex, or some ladies I brought over after we broke up, he didn’t even acknowledge them. I remember one saying hi and he ignored them. He stays in his room.

I ruptured my patellar tendon playing rugby, and I had surgery almost two weeks ago. I’ve been home from my operation for about a week, and I was with family the first few days post-op. It was an extremely painful injury, operation, and is a long recovery. I let him know about my operation via DM and he just said to ask for help if I needed any. That’s it.

I have been dealing with mental illness before my injury, and I understand he may have social anxiety or avoidant personality disorder. I understand distancing yourself from others.

> Larry has done things in the past that give me a trust issues with him. Things that happened outside of our relationship, but things that damaged my perception of who he is. 

> Larry promises up and down that he and Bob are ONLY friends, with no romantic feelings. He also added that Bob has a boyfriend and is happy, and that he himself is in a relationship and is happy. 

> I have never met Bob, spoken to them, I don't even know their age or what they look like. Larry has never made an effort to introduce us, but he HAS introduced me to his other friend ""Vicky"", as well as his mother. 

> Larry has spoken to me on the phone many times while hanging out with Vicky or his mother. He's NEVER answered the phone while hanging out with Bob. 

> His viewpoint, which he explained to me, is that ""I've been friends with Bob for 8 long years and don't want to destroy a good friendship. There's nothing between us in the slightest, and I know you don't trust me but I want to work with you on that."" 

> Has made it abundantly clear that regardless of what I do or say, he will absolutely NOT be cutting Bob out of his life. ",0.0,1.041479468345642,1,0

So today we got into it because i walked in on her pooping and she was upset because i didnt knock since the light wasnt visible from under the door like when i have it on in full brightness and since most of the time its usually empty. So i tried telling her turn on the light when your using the bathroom or lock the door so this doesnt keep happening since it happens pretty frequently because its a shared bathroom.

72,1fvq8br,WIBTA for not wearing my engagement ring?,"I 25 (f) am engaged to my 26 (m) fiancè. We’ve been together since I was 15 and he was 16, naturally throughout the years we’ve talked about marriage. I had told him that I really wanted an oval shaped, or teardrop ring. He had agreed. 

When he proposed I was over the moon, I very happily said yes. I was a little upset the ring was square and not what I had originally wanted, but figured it didn’t really matter as long as we were happy and together. 

We recently had to pawn it  because of how much we needed extra money. Well we had gotten the ring back about a week ago and I haven’t put it back on yet. The only thing I asked for was an oval or tear drop ring, I would not have cared if the ring was from Walmart, if it was expensive or not. I really just want it to be my style. So WIBTA for not wanting to wear it?

Edit: Hello everyone I would like to say thank you for all the nice comments! So I talked to my fiancè about it. He said he had gotten the ring because it was on sale and that they didn’t have an oval ring where he had went. So the reason he decided on a square one was because he was ready to be engaged. I had asked him about potentially upgrading the ring either later on or now. He had agreed and said we will upgrade it because I deserve to have something I love. 

He is not at all hurt by the fact that I want a different ring. The square ring that he had proposed to me with I put back on, just because i’m not absolutely in love with it doesn’t mean I shouldn’t wear it. It’s a symbol of his love and commitment to me. I’m happy to hear that I did not upset him or hurt him with the fact that I’m not in love with the ring he had gotten. Now I don’t know when we will get the new ring but the fact that he listened and we communicated about it makes me feel great!  

Now, I want to clarify that at first when he proposed I did like it (I just wasn’t in love with it) and wore it until we pawn it, which was a year and a half. However, while not having the ring it had made me realize that I wanted a different one. And I was going to bring it up to him before we went and got it back, but he went and got it back and surprised me with it. 

For the people in the comments saying I am ungrateful, I feel like I’m not because this is the ring that I’m going to be wearing forever. I just wanted it to be something that I absolutely love. It doesn’t have to be super expensive. It could be $50, it could be $25. Price does not matter to me. There’s just a specific shape I had in mind.

We've lived together for nearly 5 months now and I can count on one hand how many times she's replaced the empty roll in the bathroom. It's just the two of us in the apartment, and there is only one pack of toilet paper we use (that I bought).

At first, I thought I was hyper focusing on being ""fair"". I gaslit myself into thinking that for some reason, the toilet roll naturally finishes when I have to use the bathroom and not when she goes. That, to me, is acceptable so I left the situation alone and chalked it up to my shitty luck. But I've been noticing a pattern lately. Sometimes I'll head into the bathroom to find the toilet paper roll looking incredibly sparse. Maybe 3-5 usable squares left. Not enough for one person to use (we are both women. If a measly square of 1 ply is fine for you, congrats. It's not for me, and from her usage, I doubt its enough for her either). It started happening enough that I started conducting tests. If it made sense, (As petty as I am, I'm still not going to arbitrarily waste TP, we go through it fast enough as is) I'd leave just enough TP for one person to use and wait for my roommate use the bathroom before going again. You'd think that she would finish the roll and change it out, right?

Wrong.

Each and every time, she left *one* usable piece. In my book, a usable piece is any piece that is not actually glued to the cardboard roll (which is only 2 pieces max anyways, so that still would not be enough for one person).

I've been told that it's petty to not just say outright, ""hey, can you change the toilet paper?',  but she has done it before, so it's clear she knows where it's stocked and that changing it out is a necessity.

75,1fvpf03,AITA for asking my ex-roommate for money back on cleaning supplies,"My ex-roommate is my current classmate, we shared a two bedroom unit on campus and purchased cleaning supplies such as broom, dishrack, and toilet bowl brush together. As well as other neccessities like toilet paper and paper towel. Throughout the term, she used all the paper supplies like they are free. The first batch of toilet paper was purely my purchase as I had some on day one. Paper towel was shared but I never thought she can burn through them so quick. For example, I can use 1 and a lil bit more paper towel roll in 4 months. After living with her, 6 paper towel rolls were used up in about 3 months. I understand people have different lifestyles so I did not speak up to her. She also uses the toilet papers so quickly, 1-2rolls per week. But it's ok, people have different lifestyle. Perhaps she likes to clean and wipes whatever she needs to many many times. So I quickly bought another large pack of toilet paper from costco. I felt generous to share them with her as I considered her a friend. Therefore, I did not ask her for money. 
I have driven her back and forth between school city and family city (2.5h drive) round trip and never charged her money for gas. I sometimes share my cooked meals with her cause she doesn't cook and eats the same thing for the entire month and I feel that might not be nutritious enough. I let her borrow my vacuum cleaner, I drive her to school when she needs a ride, I let her use my soaps.
Then once we ran out of paper towels again, she purchased a big bag from costco and asked me to pay the other half. That's when I realized I've been doing too much? I do so much for her, I let her use toilet paper for free, hand soap and dish soap for free, I drive her for free but she still asks me for split cost... So I asked her for the toilet paper money I purchased a long time ago as I didn't charge her money. Since then, she became distanced. Stopped saying good mornings when we see each other. Walking to class in the morning became super awkward.
Now that I have moved out due to various reasons. She requested that I also split the Lysol wipes which I'm sure that she needs cause she was also using them up very quickly as well. But I took the unopened bottle and left the half used bottle behind. And told her that I want to take some cleaning tools with me and I want money back for a new mop she bought last week which I did not use. Now she just replied to me with passive agressive attitude and told me to keep the lysol wipes and my money.

Every weekend, I take Max to a local dog park, and he enjoys exploring and sniffing around. However, I’ve noticed that some dog owners see him and think he needs to socialize more. They often encourage their dogs to approach him, assuming he’ll be excited to play. This usually makes Max anxious, and he tends to back away or hide behind me.

I’ve tried to explain to other dog owners that Max prefers to keep his distance and that he can get overwhelmed if too many dogs come at him at once. Recently, I had a confrontation with another owner who insisted that I should let their dog approach Max. They claimed that socializing with their dog would help him become more confident. I calmly explained my concerns, but they dismissed me, saying I was being overly protective.

I stood my ground and told them that Max wasn’t comfortable and I wouldn’t allow the interaction. This led to a tense exchange where they accused me of not letting my dog enjoy the park. I felt guilty afterward, worrying that I might be hindering his socialization or that I was being too cautious.

Now I’m questioning whether I’m doing the right thing for Max. I want him to enjoy his time at the park, but I also want to respect his comfort level and mental well-being. AITA for not allowing my dog to interact and play with other dogs at the park?",0.0,0.0199744701385498,0,1

80,1fvox29,AITA for chewing out my husband?,"So, I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for five years. We generally have a great relationship, but there was a situation last week that really pushed me over the edge.

Here’s the backstory: We recently adopted a puppy, and we’ve both agreed that taking care of him is a shared responsibility. My husband and I had a busy week, and I had been working late nights to meet a deadline, while he had some time off. I was really counting on him to help with the puppy during this hectic time.

Fast forward to last Friday, I came home after a long day at work, completely exhausted. When I walked in, I noticed that the puppy’s crate was still closed, and the poor thing had been left alone for over eight hours without any bathroom breaks. I immediately felt a surge of panic for the puppy, and when I asked my husband what happened, he unattentively said he forgot to take him out before he left the house to run errands.

I was beyond upset. I yelled at him, telling him how irresponsible it was to leave a young puppy like that. I told him that we made a commitment to take care of him together, and leaving him in a crate all day is cruel and inexcusable. My husband got defensive and said it was just a mistake, that everyone forgets things sometimes, and I was overreacting.

I stormed off to the other room, feeling guilty for yelling, but I still think he should have been more responsible. I really care about our puppy’s well-being, and I feel like he just brushed it off like it wasn’t a big deal. Now there’s this tension between us, and I can’t help but feel like I might have overreacted.

81,1fvow7j,AITA for refusing to help my sick roommate after she was rude all day?,"Almost a year ago, my roommate and I had our first big fight. We had just arrived abroad for our studies, and I didn’t know her before that. We were also working the same part-time job that day—it was our first time working together, so we didn’t have much experience. She caught on quickly, but I was really nervous and not performing well. From the start, she was pretty harsh about how I was doing my job. I understand that my work ethic wasn’t great, and I can see why she might have been frustrated, but if her approach had been nicer, I would’ve handled the situation better.

During lunch, we ate seafood, but it gave her stomach cramps. She told me she felt sick, so I offered to take on the harder tasks. Even so, she continued being rude. By the time we were closing up, I had finished taking out the trash on my own without asking for her help because I knew she wasn’t feeling well. But then, she couldn’t find the staff bathroom and got frustrated, asking me to check with the other staff members where it was. When I did and mentioned that she was feeling nauseous, she got angry and cursed at me, claiming I embarrassed her by saying she needed to throw up.

This was my first real confrontation abroad, far from my family, and she was the only person I knew at the time. I was trying to help, so I didn’t understand why she was so upset. After work, we got on the bus together but sat in different spots. She didn’t tell me that she was going to get off and throw up. A few minutes later, she texted me asking for help, but by then I was almost home, so I declined. She blocked me on all social media after that.

We didn’t speak for a few days, and we never brought up the incident again—until recently. When we talked about it, she insisted that her actions were 100% justified and that I was the selfish one. She said she wished I had gotten sick like her and that she would never have helped me if the roles were reversed. I understand her frustration, but I don’t think being sick excuses rudeness.

84,1fvogrb,AITA for kicking my sister and her boyfriend out because they don’t respect my sleep schedule?,"My (34/f) sister (27/f) and her boyfriend (28/m) moved in with me at the end of August after he was laid off from work (she doesn’t make enough to pay rent on her own). 

The agreement was for them to stay at my apartment through the holidays so they could save up money and he could find a new job. All they’d have to contribute is $500 for rent and food. He has done his part and found a new job and they have been saving money for their move, which is part of the reason why I feel like I might be TA here.

I work graveyard in a small group home for adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities. I cannot sleep at work because I’m the only one there and I have to be awake in case one of our residents needs me or there’s an emergency. I spend my time at work cleaning, doing documentation, changing people’s depends, making their meals for the next day, and giving a few of them their showers in the morning. Needless to say, I have to stay awake and alert the entire time I’m there.

My sister has a difficult time understanding that I need my place to be reasonably quiet during the day so I can get my sleep. I could understand some normal amount of noise, but she took it over the top. Laughing obnoxiously loud; blasting her music or TV in the living room (right next to my bedroom); having loud guests over; being very loud in the bathroom and kitchen, etc…. I asked very nicely many times to please keep it down, and she always apologized and said okay. But then she started to make it my problem and said I should buy noise-cancelling headphones or sleep at my boyfriend’s place instead. 

I finally got upset and told her they’re being allowed to stay with me as guests and if she can’t act as such then they need to find somewhere else to stay. She spent the rest of the day calling all her friends and everyone in our family telling them how horrible I am for threatening to kick them out. Our parents reached out to me and asked if that was true. I told them the situation and they’re on my side, but said I should give them the month to figure things out. I called and spoke with her boyfriend and he felt genuinely bad about the situation and had no idea this was an issue. I try not to bring him into things, but figured since this would affect him, it was only right.

Now she’s even more furious with me because I “went behind her back” and called him and “manipulated” him into being on my side. I told her look, I will give them until November 1st to figure something out, and he even said it probably wouldn’t even be that long as they could go stay with his parents, but my sister is choosing to die on this hill and make me out to be the villain when all I wanted was some quiet so I could function at work. 

AITA for kicking them out? I do feel bad because her boyfriend is doing what he can and is being reasonable. I just don’t understand why my sister can’t comprehend that I can’t sacrifice my sleep and put my livelihood at risk. Thoughts?

My family financially supported me through both degrees. My parents are wealthy, and we have more money and assets than what they spent on me. In 2021, during the pandemic, I went back to China for half a year, and we got the bunny then. It was my idea, and my mom quickly agreed, often referring to the bunny as my brother since she was feeding both of us. She knew I would stay in the US for at least a few more years before we got the bunny.

Before I graduated, my mom talked about my future plans, saying that if I couldn’t fully support myself 5 months after my degree, I’d have to return to China as she wouldn’t send me money after that. I agreed, and a month before graduating, I got an internship and now a job, so I no longer need her financial support.

However, my mom has been pushing hard for me to return to China by downplaying everything in the US—food, travel, people, job—telling me China is better. She’s a strong patriot, and we never had a good relationship growing up. I also don’t want to return to China. While my country is great, I don’t like the social and work environments. I don’t know anyone there, and after living in the US for almost a decade, I’d be facing a new environment without a job, friends, or resources. Here, I have everything.

I had to make an appointment for him out of worry, only to find out she was lying. Recently, she told me she’d drop the bunny at a park’s bunny playground and let it live there. I strongly opposed it because the weather can reach 40C (104F) in summer and -20C (-4F) in winter. The bunny came from a breeder who raised them in sanitized conditions, and poor food or water could be deadly. The breeder agreed that it was a bad idea. When I told my mom, she complained they’d been caring for the bunny for 3 years and thought I would take over. Since I’m not moving back, she planned to get rid of it. I offered to visit annually, but she said she’d only keep the bunny if I moved back and settled in China in November.

I contacted the breeder, and we agreed he would care for the bunny until I decide what to do. I’ll be paying him for this.

I said ""Mr. Next Door asked me about that a while back, but he never told me he was going ahead and he never discussed style or pricing with me"". A couple of issues here - my wife HATES the fence, it is a different color and style to the other 2 sides of our yard. It's dark brown, with horizontal boards, four panels are 6 feet, the last panel is a bit shorter for some reason. Our other fences are beige stained vertical boards with a 1-foot lattice across the top. They're all 6 feet tall. The other issue is that because he used vinyl instead of pressure treated wood the cost of a 30-foot run is between $10,000 and $11,000. That's over $330 per linear foot when a wood fence would cost about $25 to $45 per linear foot. I was never given a single price or quote or choice as to what materials would be used, the design, or the cost. A few weeks ago the neighbor knocked on my door and presented me with a piece of paper with all the costs noted. Not a quote or receipt but a hand written paper. I'm sure he's not trying to cheat me but it doesn't exactly inspire confidence to see a handwritten scribble with numbers and a total. As I earlier noted it was well over $10,000!!! I said ""that's crazy, I can't pay that"". He replied that as he had picked the expensive materials I could pay him the cost of a wood fence. We left it that I would do a little research and get back to him. TBH, I didn't make it a priority to get a $ figure and pay him. It's not like we're going anywhere. We've lived here for many years and will be here for many more. Yesterday evening he knocked on my door and asked ""what's going on, I'd like to get paid"". I had done some price checking online and got a price of $1200 for a 30 foot fence, 6 feet high with horizontal slats similar to what he had installed but wood, not vinyl. I told him I would contribute $600 to the fence as he had not consulted me before installing it and I felt no obligation to pony up a couple thousand dollars for a fence my wife hates (and more importantly, for which I had zero input or notice before it was built). For a little context, we live in a modest neighborhood in a small semi, to me, a $10,000 fence is ridiculous. Had I been advised of the cost beforehand I would have said an emphatic ""NO!"" His angry response to my offer of $600 was ""that's an insult"". We left it that I would do a little more price checking and get back to him. I checked a few more websites for estimates and all came to the same ballpark - around $1200 for a 30-foot run. My inclination is to stick with what I originally said and pay him $600.

88,1fvnv96,AITA for not coming home on Thanksgiving due to my friend flying in from abroad being uninvited?,"I have a turbulent relationship with my family due to four reasons: coming out as LGBT at 18, their initial unsupportive reaction that led me to move out at 19, changing to a major they don’t like, and a high school rumor that spread about me and made my sister the target of bullying. It took them three years to finally accept me, and they didn’t believe I could be independent. Now, at 22, I’ve proven them wrong with a good job, and while our relationship is still healing, we’ve made some progress. I’ve been making an effort by calling daily and making surprise visits.

My best friend lives in Poland, and I’ve visited him many times. His family treats me like I’m part of it. When I asked my mom if he could visit for Thanksgiving, she said yes, and we booked a $750 flight in May.

My friend visited for the first time in July, and while my parents liked him, we had some disagreements, which I expressed to them—probably should have kept that to myself. Recently, I called my dad about Thanksgiving plans, and he was excited when I mentioned coming home. This would have been the first time we could all try to be together for a meal.

Today, my mom asked about my plans. I said I’d take off work and mentioned my friend was still coming. She had no memory of that and firmly stated he wasn’t welcome because of past disagreements. My parents believe that including him would complicate things further and emphasized the need for everyone to be together to solve our family relationship issues first.

I explained the trip's cost and emphasized that I wouldn’t have booked it without asking first. They didn’t believe me. I told them I likely wouldn’t come home if my friend wasn’t welcomed, and they thought I was “choosing him over them.” I informed them this visit was planned for a while, and I can’t ask him to cancel. My mom hadn’t informed my dad about her concerns. I apologized for the misunderstanding and offered to visit another weekend or just come for dinner and stay with a friend. They appreciated the compromise but were still upset, feeling I chose my friend over family.

89,1fvndln,AITA for telling my boyfriend to go fuck himself? ,"For context: I female(18) have been writing and reading english with my boyfriend ever since we knew eachother. He made a small fuss about it when we just started dating(because it isn't our native language)It was never mentioned again afterwards. My boyfriend is half English.(Thought that was easier to say, than to name the specific countries his parents are from). Usually he's pretty proud of it. Always correcting my spelling and grammar mistakes, when I write something wrong in English.(It's annoying but I don't mind) 
The past few days he's been an absolute asshole towards me. He says it's because he's nervous and stressed about personal stuff. I had my own really bad moments in the past, where he was there for me. So I'm trying to be there for him now. And to not mind his anger/rudeness. He keeps apologising every time something happens. That makes it a little better. So far he managed to do stuff that upset or angered me. But I tried staying chill about it.(If someone wants an example let me know.)

All things that happened this week combined. Left me with a short temper. Now he suddenly started speaking my native language out of nowhere. Asking me very rudely If I could speak it too, instead of English. Because he was speaking it instead of English. I ignored his request, I was answering something else he asked me in chat. I continued to speak English. He asked again in a really rude manner, to start speaking my native language. I told him I didn't want to. Asking him if he could please respect that. It was never a problem before. And now it suddenly was. He ghosted me afterwards.
I send him a goodmorning text when midnight hit. Ignored again- Until 39 minutes later. When he responded to a simple ""hi"" that I send him 2 minutes before that. In the hopes that maybe he'd say goodmorning back to me. He responded:
(* Is native language)
Me: hi
Him:*Hello
Me: hru?
Him: *what? 
Me: hru? How are you?
Him: ?
Me: how tf are you, good or bad?
Him:*What all are you saying?
Me: Yk what [boyfriends name] Go fuck yourself.

I got ignored again for 24 minutes afterwards. Before he said *goodnight* in our native language and I immediately responded back with a ""goodnight"". Am I the asshole for getting mad because he pretended not to know English? Me feeling like he was just trying to push me into speaking our native language. Was I in the wrong, for telling him to go fuck himself and not speaking my own language? Also what should I do to support him? without getting mad at him. I have no idea what to do and I need advice. Is he getting bored of me?

[Update] Turns out my bf was still awake too. After a comment I ended up speaking my native to him anyways. It seemed to calm him down. Afterwards he proceeded to send me a paragraph he wrote. To shorten what it wrote. He said he treats me really well besides atm. And he said he has all respect for me. Since I mentioned respecting my wish not to speak the native language. And that he felt like he isn't getting any right now. I know he's not doing well and I didn't even want to speak our own language with him. He said he indeed was acting childish instead of outing his anger. He was really angry. And atleast he didn't curse me out. He apologised, I cursed at him so he expects an apology back. He said maybe he would want our plans for the weekend to continue then. He said the past few days I hurt him a lot. (While I don't know how. I'd have to ask him. All he did was hurt me this past week? So where did I hurt him?) he said he took the step to put his anger aside because he loves me. He wanted to know if I was okay. That he finds respectful.

90,1fvncdn,AITA for trying to communicate with my friend?,"My (22nb) friend (18f) and I have been friends since last semester when she became one of my good friends' ""little"" in their sorority. My friend has since graduated and myself and my best friend have taken her under our wings so to speak.

My best friend and I hang out almost every day and we always invite her though recently spending time with her has been a bit overwhelming. She has a tendency to overshare and she is almost always complaining about something. This school year is her sophomore year and our university has a rule regarding who is allowed to have their cars on campus and they only allow some sophomores to have cars and she was not one of them this is where the issues began.

Ever since then she has been obsessed with the idea that she needs to have her car on campus and it is all she talks about. It's to the point where she went to my boss in Student Affairs and asked him if he could help. My boss said that there isn't much he can do unless she works for him at which point she asked him for a job. Ever since then she has been expecting the exact same treatment from our boss, despite us being in different positions. 

On Saturday I was working an event with my boss and he let me know that he was attempting to get her a faculty parking pass and that he was going to be doing the same for me because it would make parking safer for me. The following day she texted me and asked me to let her get her faculty parking pass first before I got mine. I responded and told her that this didn't make sense and was trying to explain that i didn’t have a say but she wasn't hearing me and kept arguing with me. Eventually I dropped the situation and decided that it wasn't worth it.

Since then I have been feeling as though I want to distance myself. After speaking with my therapist today I decided that these issues could definitely be solved if we simply had a one-on-one conversation about boundaries. I reached out to her and asked her if she had any time to hang out before she went home and she said she didn't and asked why. I told her no worries and that we could talk when she got back as it wasn't a big deal. She pushed further and asked me what I wanted to talk about but I said that I wanted to talk in person. From here she started calling me immature and saying she doesn't like the way I communicate and that she wasn't going to read my messages because she ""didn't have the time or energy to argue"" while actively sending me paragraph long messages. She has gotten really hostile out of nowhere and it's very frustrating for me because all I was trying to do was communicate so that we could mend the damage that was done. I'm trying really hard to figure out why she blew up all of a sudden and I understand the anxiety associated with someone wanting to talk to you and not knowing what about but to resort to name calling and all of this and saying I took things out of proportions is just so insane to me.

Anyways, i went to the bathroom to get ready and do my makeup and stuff and my bf asked to use the bathroom aswell but i thought we'd have more time so i told him to wait but by the time i got ready we were already almost late so we had to go. He said he'd use the bathroom quickly but i said i didnt want to be late so i convinced him to just go at school instead.

My dad dropped us off at school and we were like 10 minutes late already and we had a test that morning so he couldn't use the bathroom before school either. So while we were taking the test he looked kinda desperate to pee so i started feeling kinda bad and after we finished the test he said he could barely concentrate on the test and he seemed a bit mad at me. Now yesterday, he got the results on his test and yeah, he has to retake it and now he wants to talk with me about how I could've prevented this and is still kinda mad.

So AITA for making my bf fail his test because i didnt let him use the bathroom in the morning?",1.0,1.0560057163238523,1,1
94,1fvmmuq,AITA for washing an apple with dishsoap and explaining why I did it? ,"I am a 28 (f) person, temporarily lifing with my parents again. I dearly love my mom, but the relationship with my narcissistic father (71) is a rocky distant one. 

 I suffer from a lot of health-anxiety and depression: a grueling fear of toxic contaminants and infectious deseases, that makes my life rather difficult. On top of that I can't find a job right now, and I had to leave my old flat. Thankfully my parents allowed me to move back home, which I am really grateful for. But my father has absolutely no tolerance of some of the issues, that I try to hide in my everyday-life. 

What makes me uncomfortable now living with him, is the fact that he never washes his hands with soap. He washes them with water after the big business on the toilet - and that's it. He sais he has always done it like that, and he never has had stomach issues, and - look my hands look clean! Beyond that, there is no room for discussion. 

Today he handed me a special apple from the fridge that I was supposed to cut and then share with him and my mom. 
I then cleaned that apple with dishsoap and rinesed with water afterwards - since my anxiety makes me worry about his unwashed hands. My father unfortunately saw that, was appaled and announced, that he doesn't want to eat the apple anymore.  And then he told me ""you are really hopeless"", and that there is something wrong with me, and I have lost all reason, and that I am going way over top. 

In an attempt to explain myself I told him that it was because he had the apple in his unwashed hands - wich I find disgusting. (I didn't say it was causing me fear, because then I would have immeadiately lost all my accountability in his eyes) - that understandably hurt his feelings. 
And prompted him to berate me even more. He still doesn't think there is anything wrong with his hand hygiene. For him the problem is only in my head. 
My mom wants to avoid any other conflict. But the only way to stop the fight is to alplease him. So she said ""water is a solvent and can clean"". 
He then concluded, that he is glad to soon leave for a 2 week vacation; so I don't have to live with his dirty hands in a house and me and my mom can do whatever while he is gone. 

I feel sorry for hurting his feelings and I don't have the energy to discuss anymore.
Is it really unreasonable to wish, he would wash his hands with soap? 
(I am in the process of starting therapy for my anxiety, but maybe in some aspects some of my concerns are still valid...)

95,1fvmdqz,AITA for telling a mother to get her life together ,"I, 21 f, am part of a relatively small PhD program. As all PhD programs, it's incredibly rigorous, meaning missing even a few minutes of lecture can leave you confused for the whole unit. There's this one woman, a bit older than the majority of the group, who I'll call Gabby. Gabby constantly shows up late to class. This wouldn't be an issue except she always sits right next to me and then will loudly ask me to catch her up on what's going on in class. I just push my notebook over, but then she asks me questions incredibly loud (to the point professors have called her out) on certain notes she doesn't get and things. All around it's an incredibly distracting time which then leaves me scrambling to keep up with lecture. 
The first few times I didn't mind, but this is every day now. One day someone asked her in a joking way why she was always so late and she, in a very condescending manner, told us we didn't know her struggle because she had to work and was a mom. While none of the other girls could relate to being a mom (nor would ever deny how hard it is to be one), all 14 of us do in fact work, and 13 of us are full time. I personally work night shifts (11p-7a) and then go to class all day and don't get to rest until 3 pm five or take. Also, while this could be an excuse to her being late to the first class of the day, all our classes are relatively close in time so we all end up spending the whole day in the same building between classss so why she's late to the other classes of the day is still unclear. 
The worst one is when she came in 30 minutes late to an exam and kept trying to ask me questions about it, as the professor was right there. After this time, I tried talking to her about how I didn't mind sharing my notes if she came in late, but that she needed to make a more conscious effort to be to class on time and also that she couldn't talk to me and ask questions during class, but I'd be willing to catch her up on what she missed after classes. She said she would try and be more conscientious of that, but I needed to be more sympathetic to her as I didn't know how hard it was to be a mother. The very next class, despite her promise she would try to improve, the same thing happened. I've also tried sitting in a different seat, she continues to sit next to me. 
Finally today I snapped. When she came in, I did slide over my notebook a bit for her to copy, but whenever she tried to ask me a question, I ignored her. After class she asked why I did that and I told her I was not going to be missing lecture anymore because of her tardiness. She started telling me how awful of a day she was having with her son out of school with the flu and how I didn't get it as I wasn't a mother and I snapped and told her I didn't care.

97,1fwd9y9,AITA for taking my best friend's side of the argument against my boyfriend's?,"TW: Racism

There's quite a lot of background information and context to unpack for this scenario so it can be kind of hard to digest.

My best friend (who I'll refer to as Brigette in this post) has been my day-one. On the other hand, I met my boyfriend, Chandler (fake name), approximately half-way through that year.

I'm Asian, Brigette is Brown, and Chandler is white.

Everything was going perfectly well at the start of Chandler and mine's relationship.

Now, the problem is that Chandler and Brigette like to ""banter"" and ""be a hater"" for the hell of it. It was light-hearted stuff and all three of us understand this.

During a conversation in one of our group chats (four people - three of them being Brigette, Chandler and I), Brigette and Chandler were bantering as usual. Brigette was talking about MCU and Spiderman and Deadpool when Chandler said that ""they don't even meet.""

Then they went back and forth with the insults - and looking back on it now, I should've stopped the situation before it escalated - but then it led to Chandler calling Brigette a 'twat.' In response, she called him a 'wanker.' And then Chandler called her a 'w\*g.'

Which, if you don't know, is a racial slur.

Brigette obviously gets upset about this and I tell Chandler to apologise and then says he will. Chandler also tells me to stop being the middle person and ""blowing things up"" when he can apologise like a normal person.

It's the next day now and Brigette has not accepted Chandler's apology. I tell him that it's fair enough because he called her a slur. He says ""Well no crap. But to be fair, it's not like she hasn't been incredibly racist to me.""

Chandler: ""Wouldn't you agree that w\*g is equal to calling someone a 'raw chicken mayo man?' Or calling someone a monkey? I would think so. Those things, of course, being phrases we dish out to each other almost every time we speak. I'm guessing you don't even care what I'm saying. Or how I'm feeling. You'll always have her side. No matter what.""

He also says, ""Did you ask her to understand how \*I\* was feeling?""

I elaborated that she communicated her hurt to me and I didn't know how he was feeling because he didn't tell me. I also add on how he said he wanted me to stop being the middle person.

Chandler feels that I don't care about his feelings and will choose to side with Brigette any day. I tell him that I \*do\* care and I just wanted him to understand why she was upset.

Chandler says he knows why, obviously, and that he's not going to tell Brigette about \*his\* frustration because he can ignore her anyway. But then later adds on that he can't because ""my girlfriend values her friend higher than me."" I recognised his hurt and apologised but I still feel like I wasn't wrong for taking my best friend's side.

100,1fwcqhh,AITA for telling my husband that I think his brother and wife are bad parents for trying to make us watch his kid 24/7 when we visit?,"
Whenever I’m visiting the in laws (~3-4 times per year), we stay at my brother in laws house because they have an extra bedroom (and also insist we stay with them). My brother in law and his wife expect near 24/7 babysitting because I’m not working during these trips. They leave my niece with me and start asking and telling me to do things like can I feed her, why doesn’t she read a book with me, and not to let her watch tv. They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me. 

I’ve complained to my husband a few times but he seems to think that this is all normal and that this level of expectation for babysitting is also totally normal and “part of the culture” (they are south Asian). However I’m not really sure if this is the case because the tried to have their other sibling (sister) who lives in the same city agree to scheduling babysitting their kid one to two weekends every month and they obviously refused leading to a small fight. 

Recently I got so annoyed at their behavior over the past few trips (especially leaving their child with me and my husband when we have been feeling unwell and sick), that I told my husband that I don’t like his brother and think that him and his wife are extremely self centered and demanding people who are bad parents because they are always trying to pawn their kid off on other people. This obviously started a big fight as my husband feels close to his brother. 

Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-04,"AITA for telling my husband that I think his brother and wife are bad parents for trying to make us watch his kid 24/7 when we visit? 
Whenever I’m visiting the in laws (~3-4 times per year), we stay at my brother in laws house because they have an extra bedroom (and also insist we stay with them). My brother in law and his wife expect near 24/7 babysitting because I’m not working during these trips. They leave my niece with me and start asking and telling me to do things like can I feed her, why doesn’t she read a book with me, and not to let her watch tv. They basically just disappear into their own worlds the whole day (one goes to work and the other works at home). 

I don’t mind helping out for a few hours here and there but being expected to just watch her the whole day during the whole vacation (if I don’t have plans outside of the house) seems excessive to me and I find myself growing very resentful. I honestly don’t understand what they do when I’m not around as they don’t have a babysitter normally. Whenever I express that I’m tired or try to get away for some rest, they end up commenting later on in a “joking” way how me and my husband should reconsider having kids in the future since we get tired so easily. Or that we should watch my niece for a longer period of time (I.e. weeks) before seriously considering a child. These comments rub me the wrong way and seem so inappropriate to me because obviously having a child is a lot of work, but just because I don’t want to watch their child 24/7 doesn’t mean they can say such rude things to me.

101,1fwclyg,AITA for defending my girlfriend ,"I (21m) am a young adult who stays in Georgia. I don't know if that might help, but anyway, I stay with my girlfriend of 3 years. We were recently evicted, with us having to split our property (due to lack of storage units) to family. One family member being my mother. There's always been this love-hate relationship between my mother and girlfriend. She loves my mother as if she were hers, but it's never reciprocated. During the separation, I stayed with a close friend. Out of respect for his household, I made it one and went to stay with my mother while my girlfriend stayed with hers.
Throughout my stay here, it has been on-and-off behavior from my mother. Whether it's banter or her trying to sneak in a jab at my girlfriend. Who has had difficulty finding a job and holding it down. She's smaller, so she usually isn't the first pick on people's list.
Earlier tonight, my father, who left at a young age, came to my mother's home and asked for my mom. I replied she wasn't here, she should be at work. To which he replied she set this up for the three of us and wasn't even there. But I digress, me and my father chatted and he gave me an idea of how I can get back on my feet, which I incorporated into my plan for extra security. We talked and eventually chatted. He offered to repair my car (which is kinda messed up atm) and he talked to me like a friend, much less than a father, until my mother arrived. We all gathered in the living room and started to talk about the plan I made until she jumps in with a snarky remark, along the lines of she had no proof that what I was saying would hold up. I took offense and decided to be quiet until eventually it became a back and forth between us. My father, trying to keep the peace, jumped in to remind us we are family and we should hug and talk it out. I, after dealing with a lot of angry emotions, chose silence, to which my dad, in a way to get me to make the first move, gestured that would be the manly thing to do. But I remained steadfast and didn’t budge. She stands up, flips an emotional 180, and pulls the line I've never cared about her. To give context, I grew up under my mother. I missed out on a lot of things just to not be too far from her. So, upon hearing that, I really went quiet. She walks out of the room and comes back, off another 180, and says the only person I care for is my girlfriend.
Tired of dealing with the situation between the two, I bit at the argument. To which she snaps and walks aggressively towards and tells me to stop screaming because of that ugly girl. Mind you, a girl she always told was pretty and always smiling and hugging on when she's around. She stormed out and left, and me and my father had a heart to heart.

My dad and Mark have anger issues. For about a year and a half now my dad ignores Mark and doesn’t eat or talk to us when my brother is present. My mom excuses Mark's behaviour because “it is not his fault”. Mark also got kicked of a school for special needs a year ago and it caused my mom to have a second burn out. Since then she hasn't been able to work. 

We have some family experts and psychologists, but I’ve never been involved in anything, it's only about the relationship between my mom, dad and Mark. This is the way it's always been, which is why I’m really independent.

I study at the highest level school there is in my country, play volleyball and tennis, work in a restaurant, tutor, babysit and hang out with friends. I’m not dependent on my parents, I make enough money to buy my own clothes, almost never eat at home but when I do I cook for myself or eat leftovers. I also help my mom to keep the house clean. For the past year I’ve been struggling with an eating disorder and anxiety, which is really inconvenient. 

A month ago I asked my dad to go with me to get my tragus pierced, as I’m under the age of 16. The first available date was 8 October. Since the date was set I have been so excited and have been looking forward to it every day. 

The issue came up when my mom texted me a couple hours ago that I had to move the appointment because she had planned a therapy session for my parents with their new relationship therapist during it. We have a communal calendar with only one rule, whoever writes something down first ALWAYS gets priority. I wrote the piercing appointment down a month ago and my mom planned the session anyway. When I read her text I was confused and when I asked her about it she just dismisses me. She has gotten angry at me so many times for not following the calendar and not planning things fitted to the calendar. The way she just pushes aside this one thing I needed from my dad and I am so excited about really hurts me. By the way, I can move the appointment but the next available date is about a month away and I have to pay a cancellation fee. 

I decided to not confront my mom when I got home and to sleep on it, but after she kept nagging me about it I got angry, cried and told her how it made me feel.

Me (25M) and my fiance (24F) are getting married in 6 months. As soon as we started planing the wedding I was sure that I wanted my best friend (25f) of 22years to be my best (wo)man. We met in nursery school and have been best friends since. We grew like siblings due to our moms being best friends, our little brother being bestfriends since birth and being neighbours for years. My fiance never liked my best friend. She never liked us hanging out even with our families. She always thought that my best friend had feelings for me or that I would cheat on her. I reduced my contact to my best friend to please my fiance but she still is one of the most important people in my live. But even after I reduced my contact to my best friend (let's call my fiance C and my best friend L)  C wasn't happy when I would see her while visiting my family and doing something with Ls family. This would not happen often due to fact that I moved with C to another city for her work. 

I know many guys say things like she's like a sister to me even though they like the girl but in this case it is really true L even calls my mother her second mother due to the fact how close they are. I can see that L is a pretty girl but not my type at all and my fiance knows that but she is still jealous when I talk about L. 

When I told C that I want L to be my best man at the wedding and that thaf is importend to me she lost it and said that if I want her to be there so bad I should just marry L. I had a bad reaction to that and just started laughing because I couldn't believe what she was saying. After a bit of fighting she admitted that she didn't even want L at the wedding and I said that their would not be a wedding if she wasn't ok with L being in my live and attending the wedding and left to spend the weekend at my moms house. L was at almost all my importend moments and was always there for me even if that ment sacrificing her self and I can't exclude her from this day that would be like excluding the rest of my family. While being at my moms house L came over and I told her about the fight whit C, L said that she doesn't want to be a problem in my and C relationship and that she doesn't need to come to the wedding. I assured L that she isn't the one causing problems and that she will be at the wedding if there is one.

I am not sure what to do now. I don't know if I can go forward with the marriage.

So am I the asshole for having L as my best (wo)man?

But even after I reduced my contact to my best friend (let's call my fiance C and my best friend L)  C wasn't happy when I would see her while visiting my family and doing something with Ls family. This would not happen often due to fact that I moved with C to another city for her work. 

I know many guys say things like she's like a sister to me even though they like the girl but in this case it is really true L even calls my mother her second mother due to the fact how close they are. I can see that L is a pretty girl but not my type at all and my fiance knows that but she is still jealous when I talk about L. 

When I told C that I want L to be my best man at the wedding and that thaf is importend to me she lost it and said that if I want her to be there so bad I should just marry L. I had a bad reaction to that and just started laughing because I couldn't believe what she was saying. After a bit of fighting she admitted that she didn't even want L at the wedding and I said that their would not be a wedding if she wasn't ok with L being in my live and attending the wedding and left to spend the weekend at my moms house. L was at almost all my importend moments and was always there for me even if that ment sacrificing her self and I can't exclude her from this day that would be like excluding the rest of my family. While being at my moms house L came over and I told her about the fight whit C, L said that she doesn't want to be a problem in my and C relationship and that she doesn't need to come to the wedding. I assured L that she isn't the one causing problems and that she will be at the wedding if there is one.

I am not sure what to do now. I don't know if I can go forward with the marriage.

So am I the asshole for having L as my best (wo)man?

Tiny bit of important information L is a lesbian in a committed relationship of 3 years.",0.0,0.9787562489509583,1,0
108,1fw9nhg,AITA because I don’t like to talk while I eat?,"I really prefer to eat alone, and if I’m really feeling adventurous, I watch a youtube video while I eat. This specifically just applies to me when I’m at home, in my own kitchen- I have no problem being social when I’m with my girlfriend eating, with friends, etc. 

My issue is when I’m at home cooking and eating, almost every time without fail, my landlord, who also lives in the house, comes to the kitchen to talk to me. My landlord is also a family member, so we know each other pretty well. This will be important in a moment. We both cook our own meals, so I know he’s not doing it because he expects food. He just wants to talk, which is fine, and I haven’t expressed that I personally have this preference to be alone in those times. 

The reason I haven’t expressed this boundary to him is because he is much older, very set in his ways, and will turn the smallest disagreements into yelling matches at the drop of a dime. I’d really prefer to avoid unnecessary arguments if at all possible, and this feels like the kind of thing he would get very upset about. I’m the kind of person who doesn’t have an issue with standing up for myself, but I’m having a hard time being able to tell if I’m just a weirdly antisocial asshole under these unique circumstances or if I’m justified in wanting to be alone in those times.

**Important: We are a happily married couple with steady full-time jobs. We live in a stable environment, own our home (not rich, just hardworking), and have since had 2 boys together - 8 and 12 years old.

The backstory:  My husband has always had full custody of his daughter. We got together when she was 17 months old, and her visitations with biomom were spotty at best, and often nonexistent when she was growing up. 

From a very young age, she exhibited signs of mental illness, which we tried to get her help for over and over. Stealing from us turned into shoplifting, lying to us (about literally EVERYTHING, even when there was no point in it) turned into pathological lying - even to teachers, counselors, therapists, friends and friends' parents. Her behavior out of the home was stellar; inside our walls, she refused to follow rules, ignored boundaries, called both of names, or just refused to speak to us. 

She began running away whenever we tried to enforce rules or deliver consequences for breaking them. Ex: If we took away wifi access as punishment, she would just leave and not come home for days/weeks on end. 
She would bring and smoke drugs inside our home.

Then, she began telling the school and her friend's/boyfriend's parents that we would withhold food and medication from her (not true), and threatening to call CAS on us.

Eventually, she aged out of being able to use CAS against us for herself, and started threatening to call them on behalf of our oldest son. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and autism, and is on meds for the adhd. She started claiming that we're ""just sedating him to make him easier to deal with"", and telling him not to take his meds.

At that point, my husband kicked her out. Not on the streets, her friend's mom allowed her to stay there. 
But we decided that it's one thing to live with her abusive nature and deal with it as best we could, but another thing to allow her to turn it on her siblings.

113,1fw8pag,AITAH for telling my bridesmaid I didn't have room at the reception for her boyfriend of two weeks?,"To give context to my story, I moved my wedding date up from May to December because my mom was dying of cancer but died 1 1/2 months before the wedding.

So the bridesmaid insisted  going to my mom's funeral & have a date with a new guy she met while attending. She told me she was going to wear a ""sexy green dress"" to impress the guy. I told her I'd rather her not attend the funeral since I'd be too emotional to hang out like she wanted.  Truthfully, I was appalled she wanted to the funeral as an opportunity to ""impress"" a guy & have a first date.

Two weeks later, she asks if she can bring her now BF of only two weeks to the wedding. I didn't plan for her to have a plus one because she had a new boyfriend either every month or every 3 weeks. Each break up was always very messy. So, I didn't want to give her a plus one because it would likely taint our wedding or she would forever be upset about our wedding should anything happen to this BF. But beyond all of this, this guy was by far the most obnoxious  guy of all her previous boyfriends & my fiance and I weren't thrilled at the idea of him being there.

I told her due to the circumstances of the marriage, we couldn't accommodate another guest & we had an extremely tight budget due to fast tracking the wedding.

After that, she completely ghosted me, ditched the bachelorette  party, & I couldn't get in touch with her at all. Due to high emotions of everything I was dealing I then texted her saying how upset I was for her treating me this way & asked her to understand the circumstances of money regarding her BF. 

She still told me the fact that she didn't get the plus one was what hurt her. I apologized for hurting her but internally  didn't get why she was so upset. I tried reaching out twice afterwards to see if we can patch things up. Despite her being a quick texter, she left the messages on read. Finally, I demand with it being 3 days before the wedding that we talk this out before the wedding. At that point I didn't know where she stood. She finally responded and then had a phone call. The call seemed positive, we both apologized and things seemed back on track. I was debating of telling her that her BF could come, but my  fiance & friends said to stand my ground.

She comes to the wedding late, acts very cold, and is  the first to leave. She texted saying sorry for leaving but was busy with other things. I didnt know how to feel about any of it but didn't want to think about it then. After the Honeymoon, I send out thank you cards including one to her, which was more muted, but still positive & grateful. We never had any other communication since.

114,1fw8or3,AITA for ordering DoorDash in front of an unemployed relative?,"Throwaway account. I (38F) live in a two-bedroom apartment with my husband (43M) and sister-in-law (46F). My husband and I both work; I have two jobs, one of which requires getting up at 4:00 am. 

My SIL does not work and has a history of being unable to hold onto a job. She is also the most unpleasant person I’ve ever met: she’s very negative, she trauma dumps, she has jealousy issues, and she frequently overshares things I do not need to hear about (like last week when she described her digestive distress as I was trying to eat my yogurt).

Last year, my mother-in-law passed away. She was the only person who was willing to put up with my SIL's antics. Since no one else would take her in, my husband and I opened our home to her. 

She is on food stamps so she can get her food, but otherwise: she doesn’t contribute to the household much since she does not work. So she does not pay rent or any bills. All day, she sits on her butt, enjoying our TV and wifi, and does nothing. She agreed to help out with housework, but every time I come home from work, I’m greeted by a mountain of dishes in the kitchen sink that she just left there. 

Since I work two jobs and get tired, I sometimes order DoorDash. When I do, she gets visibly jealous and sulky about it, staring at me the entire time I eat it. This makes me so uncomfortable that I've started taking my food to my bedroom to eat it.

Yesterday, I got fed up. After an exhausting day at work, my husband and I were watching TV in our living room (she was in the room, too). He decided to order himself DoorDash– and I decided to order my own as well. Only this time, I did not take my Chipotle burrito upstairs: I sat right there in the living room, continued to watch my TV show, and ate my burrito as my SIL silently glowered from across the room. I ignored her, kept watching my show and eating, and then went to bed when I was done so I could get up at 4:00 am again. I also refused to wash the dishes she left in the sink.

I woke up this morning to a message from my husband telling me that my SIL is pissed off because I ordered DoorDash “right in front of her” and “didn’t even ask if she wanted anything.” He said that she is “uncomfortable” with us eating out since she isn’t able to go out to eat. She also commented about me going to bed without washing the dishes, too. He didn’t take her side, but I’m pissed about it. 

SIL is refusing to speak to me today, but I am not going to be manipulated. I bust my butt all day every day across two jobs– then come home from those two jobs and do all the housework my SIL refuses to do (the only exception being last night). If I want to order DoorDash, I’m going to freakin' order DoorDash. I earned that burrito fair and square, and I don’t think I should have to be sorry about it.

EDIT TO ADD: yes, my husband helps with housework and he shut her down when she complained to him— he was just parlaying the message. He’s also gotten into multiple fights with her over her behavior. Sorry, should’ve clarified that!

115,1fw8fy3,AITA for sending an overdue invoice? ,"
So background: i do side work for my dad to help promote his business online. I edit a lot of ads, make videos, schedule posts in advance. I charge him once a month for these posts, i make 3 posts a week and i pay a monthly subscription for the editing form i use. He AGREED to the price before i started doing this for him on the side. 

I don’t charge the rate most social media editors would charge for the work i do. I charge LESS THAN what most charge. Ionly charge for the posts. Not the time it takes to edit and make these posts. 

The problem:  

I sent my dads company the monthly invoice for September two weeks ago (this is normal since I schedule the posts two weeks in advance so if all of the month posts are scheduled and the monthly subscription is ready to be paid i send it and my father agrees) I didnt get paid that week, okay no big deal i wasn’t upset. 

The following week i sent the invoice again with a reminder. No payment, no response. I reached out to my dad to confirm he got it and he did, and he didn’t say much about it. Then the beginning of this week i sent the invoice with the letters (overdue) in red with another email that this hasnt been paid please let me know if there have been any issues, etc. no response. 

Dad calls me Wednesday and needed to confirm my bank info to pay me, okay great this means i’ll get paid. Perfect. I won’t bring it up again. 

Today he calls me bent out of shape because of the overdue invoice. 

Him “Did you seriously send this?”

Me “Yeah? I sent it as a ‘hey i never got paid’ and you never answered my attempts to talk about it. It was also sent before Wednesday when we last talked” 

Him “Well am i gonna have to pay you a late fee then?” 

Me “What? No? Again it was just a reminder that this is late and hasn’t been paid” 

Him “Well maybe i should find a different marketing manager who won’t hound me.” 

After he said this i took a moment because what? I never hounded him. Never flipped out.

So I responded with “Okay if that’s what you want to do”

Him “WOW seriously?!” 

Me “Yeah? If thats what you want to do, who am I to stop you? If you want someone else to do it, that’s your decision.”

He got pissed off and said ill be paid tomorrow. And hung up not long after that. 

AITA for sending the overdue invoice? for what i said? Or for how I handled this? This isn’t the first time he said stuff like this. Im just trying to understand what i did wrong here. 

Before when i worked for him he would threaten to hire someone to do my job for less pay, etc.

Edit: just to clarify, the invoices and the timeframe they get paid were set up this way by him and I both. He didn’t like the weekly invoices and asked for one, once a month. The expectation of the invoice being paid once it was sent, was set by him. 

That being said, I will be changing how I handle invoices here on out. IF I decide to continue doing his marketing posts. 

Edit 2: im mot hurting for this work atm. I have a full time job.  ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-04,"AITA for sending an overdue invoice?  
So background: i do side work for my dad to help promote his business online. I edit a lot of ads, make videos, schedule posts in advance. I charge him once a month for these posts, i make 3 posts a week and i pay a monthly subscription for the editing form i use. He AGREED to the price before i started doing this for him on the side. 

I don’t charge the rate most social media editors would charge for the work i do. I charge LESS THAN what most charge. Ionly charge for the posts. Not the time it takes to edit and make these posts. 

The problem:

116,1fw7yvb,AITA My aunt messaged me and said I need to be nicer to my adult cousin,"I (15)F and my cousin (21)M (well call him Dave) joke around and give each other a hard time a lot, that’s just how we are with each other. We tell each other to shut up and tease each other and playfully make fun of each other. That’s how he and my other cousins are with each other. Me and our other cousin (16)F spent the night at our Aunt (39)F (we can call her Clair) and Dave’s house last night. Dave and I didn’t interact much while me and our other cousin were over. Dave mostly just played his video game while me, Clair and our other cousin watched Netflix. Clair brought me and my cousin home a couple hours ago and when I got out of the shower and a message from her. 

“Hey love. Wanted to talk to you about something but didn't want to say it in front of everyone. I also know it's not intentional and don't want to upset you or give you panic attacks or anything and still want us to all have fun tonight, so I wasn't sure if I should. But want us all to be good and close and have open communication. But can you please try to be a little nicer to Dave? Like I said, I know it's  intentional, but lately it seems like the main communication with you two is you saying stuff to him or telling him to shut up a lot and I can tell it's hurting his feelings. I know he can be overwhelming and annoying, which I talked to him about and I can tell he's been working on being better about it. Also if he is doing something that's bothering you, just tell him please and he said he'll listen and stop. But lately he's usually not doing anything or just being a little silly which is his personality. He said he's been trying to be better about it and tries to be friends with you all. So just something I thought we could all work on and everyone be friends and get along. We love you lots! Please don't be upset, just wanted to communicate and everyone be good and on the same page. Between us he said it hurts his feelings and he feels like you don't like him anymore.” 

In the past Dave has gone to far when messing around and I’ve told him to stop and he wouldn’t and then gotten upset and ignored me and our other cousin while refusing to talk it out. Clair also constantly handles things like this for him instead of making him handle things like people hurting his feelings. 

Like I said  I barley interacted with Dave yesterday and today because we were all watching Netflix and he was playing a video game. When I did Interact with him, I had asked him if I could come do something with him soon. Then later that night I made a joke with him and then he asked if I wanted to come see one of his new animals. I went to his room with him and when we came back he told Clair I had done something really bad that I hadn’t done. I got upset and told him to shut up because I hadn’t actually done that and Clair told me it’s fine because she knows he’s just joking. 


AITA?
