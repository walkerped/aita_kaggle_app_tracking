0,1fvymv9,AITA for not telling my mother about the medication I take?,"I \[21ftm\] have been on HRT for about 1.5 years now. My mother hasn't always been the most supportive of this and wants to take a closer look at the medicine I've been prescribed, or the pamphlet that comes with it, or to see the doctor I got the prescription from.

Every time she asks I feel incredibly anxious to the point that my throat closes up and I can't talk. I don't know if she genuinely just wants to know what it is or if she's trying to figure out a way to take it away from me (which wouldn't be as big of a deal if it weren't for the fact that the prescription is supposed to be absorbed through the skin. It's unlikely that it'd do anything if my mother did touch it but I don't want to risk my mother touching itÂ *at all*).

I'm not sure if my gut feeling is right. On one hand, she is my mother, so normally she's entitled to know what medicine I'm taking in any context (and also, I do wish I could talk to her about what being trans means to me).

On the other hand, it really doesn't sit right with me that she should know everything I'm doing for myself without showing any sign that she accepts me for who I am now. I know it's probably hard for her to see me as anything other than her daughter, but every time she asks she always uses this interrogative tone I can't bring myself to trust that nothing bad will happen if I am totally open and honest with her.",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-10-04,"AITA for not telling my mother about the medication I take?
