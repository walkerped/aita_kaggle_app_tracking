0,1fwylgp,AITA for confronting my husband about his neice,"My husband (30 M) and 1 (24 F) have been together for 6-7 years now. We have 3 kids together. Our eldest daughter is 5.When i was pregnant with her my husband got locked up , i was high risk and still worked to pay for 2 lawyers for him, his special care boxes in jail, phone calls, sent money to his family in central america who were in debt and they could lose their house if they didnt pay. His sister and niece often talked to me while he was in jail and often told me he deserved being there. He always talked about wanting a daughter. However, when he got out, he often went out drinking , partying, etc. His sister would message him all the time asking for money for vacations, food,shoes,clothes, anything for her and her daughter, and he would send it. I'd struggle to put food in the house and diapers for our daughter. Eventually, i grew tired and left. After a few
months he begged me to come back , how he missed our daughter, and 1. I went back. We had more kids , he doesn't drink anymore, just works and comes home. The thing is, he continues to make time for his neice (17 F) , video calls texting all day every day. He always messages her asking if she's okay, if
she's already in school, etc. He told me once that if i could help out , his parents' property was slidding. The dirt started to slide. To avoid the house going with it, they had to fix the foundation and add a wall on the ground. I gave him money and he put a lot of money too. Only to find out weeks later , that the money was actually to create a bigger room and closet for his neice.When he gets home
and our daughter tries to talk to him about her day at kinder he doesn't pay attn, but when his neice calls, he jumps to answer the calls. It's gotten to the point where he has literally called our daughter by his nieces name, various times. When i went to buy shoes for our kids and my mom, he asked me to get his parents some too. I did turn out those shoes i got his ""mom"" were for his neice. I confronted him about it and asked he focus on his children first . If he can't do that, then I'll go back to my hometown.

4,1fwxkq1,AITA for offering a hair dye suggestion ?,"My (20F) boyfriend’s (22M) hair is almost white and so are his eyebrows.  Yes he has albinism. 

I was dyeing my roots and I told him I think he should dye his hair too. He asked where that came from now and I told him I just thought dark hair would really suit him. It would create a nice little contrast. (he has very, very pale skin and very light blue, almost violet eyes)

He asked me wasn’t I’m the complaining about having to dye my roots every months. I told him yes but that’s because my hair is naturally darker so I have to bleach it before actually dyeing them. He wouldn’t have to do that. He can just dye as it is. It’s easy. I would even do it for him. 

He asked me why do I insist on this so much . I told him I wasn’t insisting , I’m just offering. If he doesn’t want it he can just say that.  But I think it would look really hot on him and if I were him I would give it a try. 

He told me I was trying to change him and not accepting him as it is and I want a guy with darker hair I should find one. 

I told him he was being dramatic for no reason. This has nothing to do with me wanting to change him or wanting a different guy. I just thought it would look good on him. It was just a suggestion. 

He told me I was being dismissive and disrespectful to his identity. I feel like that’s such a reach.

5,1fwxf2u,AITA for for telling my sister she needs to speak to her daughter and can't keep ignoring the problem?,"Please tell me if I was wrong! So my sister has a blended family. Her daughter (7) is from her ex. Her husband has two kids, a son (14) and daughter (12). My sister has been married to her husband for 6 years. They met while she was pregnant and didn't start dating for several months. But from beginning a romantic relationship to marriage took about 6 months. And my sister's stepkids knew her and my niece for less time than that. So I think that has played a role in some of the problems.

My sister and her husband have sole custody of their children, which means they have grown up together and my niece doesn't know life without them. But my sister's stepkids do not consider my sister or niece family and they have vocalized that stepfamily is not real family in their eyes. My niece never knew they felt this way until she heard them both say it within a couple of days. She has picked up on the fact they leave her out a lot but accepted the age gap being the reason.

However hearing that they don't think of her as real family or stepfamilies as real family has upset her. Added to that, they apparently sounded like it was a really bad thing if anyone thought she was their real family and that was so upsetting for her.

My sister has told me before she does not want me feeding into the idea that this is set in stone from her stepkids. She doesn't want her daughter too know that there are people in the world who feel that way and stay that way. All she wants is her daughter to believe this will change and to keep loving them. I told my sister before that my niece is being set up for heartache but she doesn't believe so. And she is very firm about what family tells my niece.

Because of this, when my niece told me about the stuff her stepsiblings said and wanted to know why, and cried on my shoulder and sought my cuddles, I knew I couldn't say anything or my sister might limit contact. But I know this can't continue. So I went and spoke to my sister and I told her clearly that she needs to talk to her daughter and she can't keep ignoring the problem because she's hurting and confused and it will do more harm for her to be left with questions and potentially doubting herself. I told her my niece doesn't deserve that. My sister told me to mind my own fucking business and told me I didn't have the right to tell her how to be a mom.

One of our parents had a best friend who we will call, Emily (60s F). Emily has been a wonderful family friend to my brother and me ever since we were kids. And she's become like a second mother to us. However, she's sent us cookies for the last few years as Christmas gifts. And these aren't homemade cookies, these are cookies from some catalog that, to be honest taste like cardboard. And as a result, we don't eat them and they expire to the point where they become unedible because they're so stale.

And for me, I truly hate wasting food because it could've gone to people who are struggling to eat. I've tried to donate the cookies as soon as possible many times before, but our schedules get in the way of everything along with Holiday hours as soon as we get the gift. So many areas start either closing too early for us, or some events prevent us from donating so there's a very small time frame in which the cookies can be donated.

So as a result my brother and I concluded, we have to tell Emily that while we appreciate the thought and all, we don't want any more of these cookies for Christmas especially because we don't eat them.

We feel bad for Emily because she spends her hard-earned money on a gift that goes to waste every year. However, here's where I may be TA.

I talked to my therapist about this and she told me, ""But it's usually the thought that counts you might be hurting her feelings if you tell her."" Now to clarify we're not going to ask for another gift or anything, we just don't want her to waste all of her money on stuff we don't even eat.

For context: I (M29) live with my mother, because my situation is quite difficult (I work in different schools, but I'm still saving up to buy my own car, so I drive my mother's car or use public transport when available); I don't think I could live independently as of now. My boyfriend (M32) visits almost every weekend, and my mother has expressed that's she's fine with it. 
Now, my relationship with my mother is kind of a rollercoaster. Every time I do something she doesn't like, she gets mad and basically insults me and stops talking to me.

Now onto the situation at hand.
I was called yesterday to go work at a school that's half an hour from my home. I told her, and she said we would talk later about it. Today my bf visited, and during lunch, she started asking why I accepted the job, and how I was planning to go. I told her that was the only good option I had, and I could simply take a bus if she needed the car. I guess she didn't care about what I said, because she kept going about how I don't think things through, that I only think about myself. My bf interjected, saying the same thing as me, that I could take the bus and there's not any problem with it. She started crying, and I told her that if she had a problem with bf she could just talk to him. After a while in silence, she left.

A couple of hours passed and she told me that I couldn't use her car and that my bf has no business butting in our arguments.
I told her that if she didn't want him to say anything, she shouldn't have brought up the conversation in front of him. She disagrees, saying that we're in the wrong and that it's not normal for him to butt in, that he should've stay quiet.

I'm fine with my bf stepping in the argument, but I have to wonder if she has a point and we're the assholes here?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-05,"AITA for being okay with my boyfriend stepping in? Throwaway account for privacy. First of all, english is not my native language.

For context: I (M29) live with my mother, because my situation is quite difficult (I work in different schools, but I'm still saving up to buy my own car, so I drive my mother's car or use public transport when available); I don't think I could live independently as of now. My boyfriend (M32) visits almost every weekend, and my mother has expressed that's she's fine with it. 
Now, my relationship with my mother is kind of a rollercoaster. Every time I do something she doesn't like, she gets mad and basically insults me and stops talking to me.

12,1fww3x7,AITA for telling my wife and BIL they need to move on and leave their stepsister alone?,"My MIL is elderly and is struggling to live alone but doesn't want her kids taking care of her. So there have been some talks about what the next steps are between my wife and my BIL. They want their stepsister to be a part of all of this. She is their late stepdad's daughter. They've known her since they were toddlers and she was 5 years old. Raised together. They see her as just a sister but she always used step for them and this has not changed in 30 something years.

After my wife's stepdad died contact with the stepsister basically ceased to exist. I think she saw the death of her father as the death of any obligation to keep in touch. My wife and BIL and MIL tried to stay in touch but it was very one sided. She never reciprocated.

They did speak to her about MIL and her need for care and she told them this was not her problem and she wanted no part in planning. That she took care of her dad and that was where her duty ended because MIL is not her mom or her family and neither are they.

My wife and BIL didn't like this. They have called her selfish and brought up repeatedly that MIL adores her and helped raise her from the age of 5.

I have jumped in and told them they need to move on and figure out a plan together while leaving their stepsister alone because clearly she isn't going to change her mind and trying to shame her won't work either. But they think I shouldn't interfere.

14,1fwvkjc,AITA for hanging out with my ex girlfriends brother,"Using a throwaway account for this one

I (27F) dated Jenna (26F) for around 6 years, though we had been friends since high school. After graduating college, we decided to move get an apartment together in a nearby city. Things went really well for about four years. I got closer with her family (I don't speak to my own for reasons I'd rather not get into) and really felt like I was making a life for myself. 

The problems started about a year and a half ago when she accepted a job that paid much better but had significantly more hours. We went from going out about once a week to her working through nearly every weekend. It was really stressful to see her overworking herself but she promised me that she would lessen her workload once she got used to the new job. This was her dream job and even though I felt a bit neglected I didn't resent her for it.

Things got worse over the next few months. Bickering over little things would turn into screaming arguments. We both thought it was just a rough patch that would pass if we gave it a bit of time.

In the meantime I started getting into table top games like D&D and Pathfinder. Coincidentally her younger brother Brian (25) worked at a gaming store downtown and we became fast friends. As me and Jenna's relationship started to crumble, he and his fiancée Morgan (27F) were there for me and I frequently crashed on their couch when I got kicked out of our apartment.

Long story short: we broke up three months ago. It was pretty mutual, we both realized how toxic our relationship was getting and decided to split up. I admit that I was just as much at fault for things falling apart as she was.

I did stay friends with her brother though. Me, Brian, and Morgan started a campaign with three of their other friends. I quickly became a part of the friend group. The breakup was rough but they're helping me get through it and are really supportive of me getting my life back together. 

The problem came last week when Morgan took a selfie of the six of us at brunch. I was in the back of the picture talking with one of our friends and honestly didn't notice the picture being taken. A few hours later though Jenna started blowing up my phone demanding to know why I was hanging out with her brother. She said that it seemed weird and desperate and that I was trying to get back at her.

Morgan was really apologetic and offered to take down the photo but I told her that Jenna was being irrational.

So, AITA?

In an extremely busy second hand games and DVD shop (CEX for those in the UK) today, peak time on a Saturday afternoon in a very busy shopping centre, I was waiting in a queue to be served that was so long and cramped that it was wrapping into other aisles. I must have waited in this queue for around 10 minutes before making it almost to the front. 

A mother ahead of me had parked her baby’s pram at the first spot in the line, and then left the line to another aisle to browse. The employee at the till called for the next customer and locked eyes directly with me, and with the mother not in the line and nowhere to be seen, after a couple of seconds I walked ahead to be served. About a minute into my transaction, the employee next to the one serving me called for their next customer, and the mother walked up and glared at me and immediately said with an angry tone that “I was next in line, just so you know.” I was actually taken aback by how annoyed she sounded and looked when she said this. I finished my transaction and responded that she should have been in the line next time. As I walked out of the shop she told me to fuck off. Lol. 

Now, I’m not sure if I was the asshole for going ahead of her as she seemed to genuinely be seething about it, but I didn’t want to wait any longer for her and she had technically left the line.

Okay so my gf and I have great chemistry. We enjoy staying in and going out. Everything is fine for the most part until she’s away from me. Usually she’ll be at work and something will put her in a bad mood. Then all it takes is any slight thing from me to set her off and here comes her attitude. I’m having trouble formulating the words of what’s she’s doing so I’ll give examples from today:

We are talking all morning while where both at work via texting like normal. We had a few short phone calls back and forth, also normal. Then she goes touch and we’re talking for a few minutes and I send a response back to her message about groceries that said “oh we need both of those” and then she responds with “yeah”. 12 minutes go by, and she starts going off on me about how I never call her on her lunch breaks anymore and I just “stopped talking” out of nowhere. Meanwhile she knows I’m driving home after work. She follows up with “I think it’s funny how you just leave me on read all the time now and you don’t call on my lunch breaks.” This isn’t the case at all. We regularly call each and text throughout her day and lunch breaks. There’s never been a time of leaving her “on read” for any reason other than our immediate conversation just ended and there was nothing more to follow up. 

Am I the asshole for always having to be the one to follow up and start a new topic? Should I watch the clock and make sure I’m always responding and calling her to make sure I’m appeasing her expectations of need? Like most times I can’t get enough of her but sometimes I just want to vibe and listen to music while I work or drive home.

She started making statements that’s really got under my skin like:

“You’re right it’s all my fault for getting upset, I shouldn’t gave expected you to call or anything.”

“I’m sorry for getting upset I’ll figure out something to do on my own from now on.”

“Don’t worry about calling or texting me, I’ll just accept whatever you decide to do when you want to talk or call.”

Honestly I have no idea where this is coming from as she’s never acted like this before. It just seems like she trying to me out to be some asshole but I literally do so much for her. I like the little things and I know how much happiness it brings her, but I don’t talk for 12 minutes and she goes off on me for “always” leaving her on read, and that “it I don’t want to talk to her anymore just say so”.

I’m really at a loss, if there’s a word for her behavior of what’s she’s doing and saying please someone help. If I’m the asshole also please help.

She has started going braless when home. I am no prude, but she should definitely wear a bra. They are very noticeable and move alot when she isn't wearing a bra. Especially when she wears those revealing short tops.

Well, I work in the music industry and while I was at an event center doing a show I noticed they also had Dianna Ross coming soon, so I bought 2 tickets so her and I could go. I bought it as a birthday gift. I don’t even like Diana Ross but I figured she’d be happy so I’d just suck it up and go. Tickets were around $300 with taxes and interest since I used a credit card and they were decent seats. It’s more than I wanted to pay, but again, birthday gift.

Ok, so I get home, show her the tickets and she says, “nah, I don’t like crowds and COVID.”

But yet, the event center is at the same Casino she will regularly go to and chain smoke cigarettes while playing slots in rows full of strange people.

I bought it as a birthday gift. I don’t even like Diana Ross but I figured she’d be happy so I’d just suck it up and go. Tickets were around $300 with taxes and interest since I used a credit card and they were decent seats. It’s more than I wanted to pay, but again, birthday gift.

Ok, so I get home, show her the tickets and she says, “nah, I don’t like crowds and COVID.”

But yet, the event center is at the same Casino she will regularly go to and chain smoke cigarettes while playing slots in rows full of strange people.

I don’t know, maybe I should’ve ask before hand, but I planned it to be a surprise. On the other hand, she tends to be a narcissistic bitch anyway, so I kinda felt like this was just another chance to say Fuck You without actually saying it.",0.0,0.040709253,0,1

20,1fwus4p,AITAH for canceling on my friend because she invited her spouse who I barely know?,"One of my (37F) best friends (37F) is someone I met at my first job, post college. While we both moved to different departments and companies through the last 15 years, we’ve remained close and have a monthly, standing hang out.

Both of us are married, no kids. However, I think due our friendship being work related, our spouses have only met on rare ocassions (milestones). What’s more, my friend often complains excessively about her spouse. She once filed for divorce and changed her mind, and another time, moved in with her sister for a trial separation. While her spouse is by no means abusive, she says he’s overbearing, overcompensating, which I’ve noticed too in my few meetings with him. She also said she married him too young (she was new to the country, he paid attention to her when she was lonely, etc).

That said, for this month’s standing hang out, my friend bought two tickets to a concert. It was also for my birthday. However, 1.5 weeks before the show, she resold the original tickets and instead bought three seats together, so her spouse could join. This confused me because, as said above, we never include our spouses in our standing hang outs and we don’t know one another well. She also didn’t invite my own spouse, and when I asked why, she said “oh, sorry. I didn’t think she’d join as she’s so busy with medical fellowship.”

I slept on it for a few days, but decided I’d feel uncomfortable. I told her to enjoy the show with her spouse, and that she and I could do something else this month. She said I was being dramatic and overthinking the situation, and to think about it over the weekend. On Monday, I texted her the same as above, to enjoy the show with her spouse. I also offered to pay for the third ticket, which my own spouse said was too nice of me.

My friend didn’t respond and hasn’t spoken to me since, which is off for us - we communicate everyday in some fashion.

1.) My friend‘s husband knows I‘m a lesbian and that I’m married to a woman. They’ve met maybe four, five times at our mutual colleagues’ children’s graduation parties, retirement parties, etc. 

2.) The only thing that’s ever come up about my sexuality is one time, my friend said her husband isn’t bothered by LGBT people, personally, he just “doesn’t understand it.” I will say they are from the Middle East, if that makes a difference. 

3.) There’s nothing going on between my friend and I, physically or emotionally. My wife has no problem with the friendship. 

4.) Typically, our hang outs are dinner, drinks, a bookstore / coffee shop, walk with our dogs, etc. Maybe her husband was suspicious that this was a more planned, weekend event?

Certainly hope I didn’t ruin the friendship by giving off “I’m too good to chill with husband“ vibe. I guess we  will see.

I had to have reconstructive surgery on my right wrist this week due to a car accident.  Initially it was supposed to be a simple repair but due to a hyper mobility issue, the surgeon said it would have to be much more involved, requiring both donor and synthetic reinforcement.  
I’m right hand dominant and spend about 10 hours a day doing a computer related job, so I am very scared for my job as my right hand will be unusable for about the next 4 months.

I went back to work 2 days after surgery, but haven’t been able to put in a full day this week due to side effects from the meds.

I’ve been distracting myself a lot with my phone , scrolling FB and Reddit to help keep me calm.  Last night were laying in bed, he just got done chewing out our kids for some infraction. Right now no matter how big or small the issue is, he goes from 0-100 big mad about it.  I know he’s frustrated and feeling cooped up having to take care of me and the kids but damn.

Anyways when I got my new car my stepdad started acting like some father figure. He would say “It’s time to get to the next step in life” etc. he tells my mom thqg he wants me to get a new barber & haircut. He said this for a while  then one day he was like “alright time for ur haircut tommorrow You’re gonna get a new haircut that’s more modern That makes you look like a man and will get you the girls You’ll be a forever changed man You need the popular haircut that todays men have”. 

I didn’t want a new haircut but was too afraid to say anything cuz he owns the house. so i told my mom i don’t wanna get a new haircut. 1, my haircut doesn’t have an age limit. It’s a unique that only i do. 2nd everyone around my age has their own style. nobody is the same. It depends on face shape. 3rd i got a baby face so my hair won’t make me look like a man. My mom said he prob wants to control me cuz he can’t control his daughter since his daughter left over a year ago. 

Anyways today he told me “I’m not trying to hurt you i’m just telling you to get a new haircut because you need to get to the new step in life and be a changed man If you don’t wanna change the haircut then that’s fine you’re old enough to make that decision but you should try”. At the barber He didn’t let me introduce my self to the barber and kept telling me again to “try”  new hair styles so i did. They gave me selections but you know the things in photos will look different irl and it only showed 1 angle. 

the whole time my stepdad was just constantly talking to me & the barber with some massive smile and constantly talking about hair and how all the girls will approach me and i’ll look like a man… The guy was acting like a proud father in a movie. him and the barber were saying how my stepdad cares so much about me and telling me my hair is perfect nonstop. The hairstyle ended up being shit. I had many bald spots and left side of the hair looked messy. other people at work agreed thought jt looked weird too. They asked what the hell was that etc.

At home i told my mom i hated the haircut then i heard my stepdad saying behind my back to her that im unappreciative and that im gonna look like a child again with the old hair cut i had. He never said anything to my face tho which is funny. He also went on about how i wasted his 40 dollars and his time when he chose to do this and kept pushing me to change my hair.

I thought it would be fine since the phrase was also said by a woman in the movie. Now I'm not so sure anymore.

Aunt decided to take dads ex wife as her +1. Dad and his ex have been divorced for 5 years now. They got married when I was 7 though which is where my aunt is coming into play. Dad had me and my three older siblings when he met his ex. They met not too long after my mom died. But it took a few months for them to start dating. None of us (siblings and me) really connected with her or cared much for her. To us she was dads wife who couldn't have kids of her own and saw us as her chance at motherhood. She made us uncomfortable sometimes with how insistent she was that she was now the mom of the family. It got really awkward at times when we were younger and dad was doing something for us but she wanted to do it instead. My aunt always liked that she tried to step in and become mom. For one she never liked our mom. But it was also her belief that when kids lose one parent, someone needs to fill that space for them.

So when dad and his ex divorced and none of my siblings or I kept in contact with his ex, it pissed her off. She told us repeatedly she felt the ex deserved better and she should be regarded as mom in some way after all those years. She should be seen as someone worth keeping around to all of us.

I didn't know before my wedding day that the ex was her plus one. It didn't bother me. But I was clear that she wasn't going to be in the wedding photos. My aunt hated it and she expected to be able to sneak her in but no that was taken care of. My aunt also wanted me to dance with the ex but I didn't.

After the wedding my aunt went a little crazy on me and since then she has told me on an almost daily basis that she thinks I was a shithead for doing that to the ex. She told me I had mom for 5 years but I had the ex for 14 and she did most of the raising of me and my siblings so we should all be keeping her as mom and for the future as grandma. She told me it was disgusting to exclude her during the wedding too when she was already there. I told my aunt I hadn't invited the ex and I was never going to.

28,1fwm0mu,AITA Made my mom come home after a night out with friends,"Oh boy this is a LONG story but I’ve never been so emotionally conflicted. So my mom and dad are both separated, it’s been over 8 years since then and they’ve been really good friends, however my dad and me both worry about my mom because she has a habit of running towards red flags when it comes to dating. She has technically just got out of a 4 year long abusive relationship with a guy she meet but since then has been more cautious. But the pain of having to watch her go through that is still fresh in me and my dad’s minds so now we have a hard time trusting her when she wants to go out on her own with people we’ve never met.

So tonight my dad had put me in a very difficult spot, we were all partying downtown as part of a monthly get together we usually have and it’s often a lot of fun but my mom had invited some of her work friends to join, that wouldn’t have been an issue if it wasn’t for the fact she clearly was attracted to one of her coworkers. Me and my dad caught on quickly but kept our distance. A few hours later my dad tells me he needs to go home and demands I don’t come home without my mom, and that’s where the issue starts. He basically put me in charge of my mother. 

At first I didn’t mind because I assumed we’d be going home later anyway but it became apparent that my mom wanted to go home with this other guy and wanted to stay out later than expected. My brain couldn’t handle the situation I was put into, on one hand I wanted to go home and trusted my mom will take care of herself since she’s an adult but on the other I would never forgive myself if she ended up missing or harmed by this stranger. So I chose to stay the ENTIRE night with her and kept insisting it was time to go home. So she finally caved but is not extremely angry with me and my dad for not trusting her.

32,1fwkjxt,AITA for not inviting my brother to my son’s graduation because he made it all about his new girlfriend (again)?,"I (41M) have a son, Sam (18M), who recently graduated from high school. This was a huge milestone, and we had been planning a special family dinner to celebrate. I was proud of him and wanted the evening to be focused on his accomplishments, as he worked so hard to get to this point.

My brother, Alex (38M), has a bit of a history when it comes to family events. Every time he gets into a new relationship, he parades his new girlfriend around, turning any occasion into ""meet the girlfriend"" night. It’s happened so many times that it’s become a running joke in the family, but this time, I wasn’t in the mood for distractions. He just started dating Lisa (27F) a couple of months ago, and I knew exactly how the night would go Alex introducing her to everyone like she’s the main event, hogging conversations, and making it about them rather than Sam.

So, I asked him not to bring her to the dinner. I told him it wasn’t personal, but I wanted the focus to be on Sam, not on his new relationship. I thought Alex would understand, but he lost it. He called me selfish, said I was jealous because he was happy again after his divorce, and accused me of deliberately excluding him. My parents, always the peacemakers, got involved and started pressuring me to let it go. They said Alex ""deserved to be happy"" and that Lisa should be welcomed with open arms, especially since Alex hasn’t been in a serious relationship since his divorce.

They made me feel like I was ruining family harmony, but I stood my ground. I wanted this night to be special for Sam, not another spectacle about Alex's latest girlfriend. In the end, Alex refused to come without her, so I didn’t invite him at all. Now, my parents are furious, saying I’m alienating my own brother over something petty, and Alex is spreading the word that I’m ""punishing him for being in love."" Sam had a great night, but I can’t shake the feeling that I’ve caused unnecessary drama. Some family members agree with me, but others say I could have just let him bring her to avoid conflict.

I’m stuck wondering: was I wrong for drawing this line, or is Alex the one who’s making everything about himself yet again?

We got there at 8am we didn’t leave until 1pm 💀💀 I also acknowledge that what I did was hella inconsiderate and I did not do it on purpose it was completely unintentional when he came out of the dentist office he was grumpy and I assumed he was hangry so my instinct was to head over to McDonald’s to get us food I literally did not realize my mistake until I was at the drive thru speaker asking him what he wanted to eat and he just looked at me like I was crazy and pointed at his mouth 😅 I was like omfg I am so sorry and that’s when I offered the smoothie and soup to him. 

The only real problem that I took serious was when he tried to tell me to get out of the car with my food I get where he was coming from but I thought that was crazy and it hurt my feelings. I do also understand when people were saying “if the roles were reversed you’d be mad at him too” and I probably would I mean if he offered me soup I’d been okay maybe idk it didn’t happen to me, but when women are mean to men they don’t take us seriously anyway but it’s something different about when a man is mean and mad at you idk about you guys but he doesn’t get mad at me often so I know when he’s mad at me he’s really mad. At the end of the day he’s still my muffin and we are over the situation now. When he tried to kick me out of the car I just stopped eating and took him to go get a soup from Panera he was happy and passed out after he ate. I’m 24 he’s 26 we’ve been together since I was 18 and we knew each other even before then.

34,1fwk7vu,AITA for wanting one item that’s special to me after my grandfather passed? TW: Death,"I’m slightly changing some details for anonymity.

My 82 y/o grandfather passed away this year. My husband (43/m), son (17/m) and I (40/f) are the ones that found him. We are the ones that called 911 and did CPR on him which was extremely traumatic.

Some background- Growing up my grandparents were the ones that raised me. We lived with them when I was a child until my teenage years when my mother married her third husband. My sister and I were extremely abused (Reddit won’t me go into detail as it made me delete my first post and start over but it was every type of abuse you can think of). I lived with my mother all of 2 years my entire life after she got her own place due to everything that happened in my childhood. I have CPTSD, and depression from it. 

On to the current situation- I asked for my grandfathers record/8 track/radio player. I have very fond memories with it. Every Christmas he would put on a specific record and we would dance and decorate the Christmas tree. My aunt and mother already took all the records to be appraised and the speakers don’t work on the player but my neighbor runs an audio business and I was going to have him fix them. 

They told me I couldn’t have it. They said they want to auction it at the estate sale because they “aren’t getting enough money”. I’m not kidding they said exactly that. I reminded them that they got his life insurance money and they’re getting the funds for the sale of his home, my mom told me it “wasn’t enough”. 

I know who’s buying the home and they’re making $75k each just on the sale of it alone. I got off the phone and I just bawled my eyes out. I couldn’t hold it in. My son saw me upset and apparently spoke my mother behind my back and begged her to let us have it. He looked it up and it would go at most for $60 but he told me he didn’t want them to say no so he offered them $150 for it. They agreed. And to be honest that has made me even more angry. They are willing to take advantage of my child and take $150 from him. 

Well, I had the opportunity to look at the will. And it states that grandchildren and great grandchildren are allowed to select mementos that they desire. The executor of the will is the attorney. Because of this I told my son not to pay them (they wanted to the money right then) and to tell them since the money has to go to the estate I wanted to speak to the attorney to make sure we do it right. My mother was extremely rude to my son and laughed in his face and told him “good luck with that”. 

This has gotten extremely ridiculous. All I wanted was something special to share from my childhood with my children. I honestly can’t believe how greedy and manipulative they are being. But I can say as soon as I speak with the attorney and get this sorted out I will NEVER speak to my family again.

I reminded them that they got his life insurance money and they’re getting the funds for the sale of his home, my mom told me it “wasn’t enough”. 

I know who’s buying the home and they’re making $75k each just on the sale of it alone. I got off the phone and I just bawled my eyes out. I couldn’t hold it in. My son saw me upset and apparently spoke my mother behind my back and begged her to let us have it. He looked it up and it would go at most for $60 but he told me he didn’t want them to say no so he offered them $150 for it. They agreed. And to be honest that has made me even more angry. They are willing to take advantage of my child and take $150 from him. 

Well, I had the opportunity to look at the will. And it states that grandchildren and great grandchildren are allowed to select mementos that they desire. The executor of the will is the attorney. Because of this I told my son not to pay them (they wanted to the money right then) and to tell them since the money has to go to the estate I wanted to speak to the attorney to make sure we do it right. My mother was extremely rude to my son and laughed in his face and told him “good luck with that”. 

This has gotten extremely ridiculous. All I wanted was something special to share from my childhood with my children. I honestly can’t believe how greedy and manipulative they are being. But I can say as soon as I speak with the attorney and get this sorted out I will NEVER speak to my family again. 

AITA for wanting the player and saying we need to talk to the attorney first to make sure we do everything appropriately?",0.0,0.025687251,0,1
35,1fwjwa9,AITAH for refusing to skip my festival when my mother asked me to put things away ,"I (17f) and my mother (40f) are in an argument and I need outside opinions. 

This morning we had professional carpet cleaners come into our house to shampoo the carpet, and for them to clean my room, I ended up taking everything but the bed and bookcase out of my room. I packaged anything small into boxes and put them with my dresser and desk. I then left for my bio dads house for the weekend, and planned on Saturday to go to a festival I had been planning for a long time. I then received a call and text from my mother telling me I had to come over to put away my stuff. I told her I couldn’t as I had to play at a football game (band kid) and I had the festival tomorrow. She got mad at me saying she doubted I would actually put them away ever.

36,1fwjstu,AITA for hanging out with a guy I just met every single time I get without my fiancé?,"I am in the navy and got orders overseas. (I’m trying to get my fiancé with me as soon as possible) I got to my command around 2 months ago. Most of the command deployed and only few people left to stay. All males and only one female apart from me. Needless to say that there’s no one in this country I knew or could rely on when I got here, I don’t know the language or where anything was at first, I didn’t even know how to get a taxi or leave base by myself. 

The first week I made friends with the only other female. She invited me to her friend group (her and 2 males) they never tried to make advances or show romantic interest in either me or her. we pretty much hang out all together, exploring new places and eating at restaurants. My Fiancé wasn’t really happy about it at first, since he wanted to be here to also explore new things with me and feeling I was paying attention and giving my time to my new friends instead of talking with him since there’s limited time for us to interact due to the schedule differences. We talked and with time, we came to an agreement. 

Little by little my friends left for different reasons, leaving me with only one of the male friends from the group. At that point it was an actual friendship rather than just someone you know from a friend group. He also has been in the navy and the command longer than me, so when I have a question i tend to rely on him, creating times where he would show me places I don’t know how to get to, running errands together that we both have to do or sometimes going to eat together, sometimes only for the company. 

Today, talking with my fiance about different topics the situation of me hanging out with my friend came back after I said that sometimes we have different ways of seeing life, him in a more conservative way than me, that everything was about perspective from the people that was on the other end; maybe people that it’s closer to his way of thinking will support him and viceversa with me. He said that it wasn’t just like that, he thinks that most of people wouldn’t be ok if their fiancé was hanging out with a male by herself, that it wasn’t about their perspective in life. Am I doing wrong for hanging out with him just the 2 of us?

37,1fwjlsu,AITA for not getting my dad anything?,"Today I had a highschool football game I had to go to as drill manager and didn’t come back home until 12:00 since the game was away. On the way to the game, we stopped at buckees to get cheer, band, and drill something to eat before the game since it was two hours away. We got all of our snacks and food and then went into the bus again.
 
Fast forward, the games ends and we’re on our way home. Once I make it back to my house, my dad opens up the door and apologizes for not opening the door, which ofc I forgive him since it was no big deal. I walk in with a bag from buckees and I set my stuff down and he looks at me with his hand out as I put it up, and I say “what is it?” He then says, “Oh, I thought you got something for me.” I then looked at him weirdly and then I felt guilty as I was putting up my cinnamon roll in the refrigerator. While I was walking to it, he gave me a disappointed look, but not a sad one. It was more of a “I knew you didn’t” kinda look. 

To give you a little background, this isn’t the only time this has happened. I didn’t really think to much about anyone at home because I was enjoying not having to for once. I always clean the house, the dishes, and the bathroom when no one is around, and I cook for myself most of the time. My dad is always talking me being selfish and about how I always think about “Layla” aka, myself, and how he works hard to provide for me and my siblings. But somehow, he always makes me feel bad when I go somewhere and don’t get anything for him or anyone. It makes me feel like I owe him just for living with him even though I’m his daughter. I would like to get him something sometimes, but moments like these deter me from doing that because when I do cook him food or get him something, he says “no no no, save it for later,” and it confuses me.

Recently, my distant uncle who lives in Europe asked us to take in our baby cousin, who is only a few months old. We live a few countries away, and he has two other kids, a boy and a girl who are a little older. He wants someone to take care of their baby until he's at least 8 months old, since he and my aunt also work full-time jobs and simply can't take care of a baby right now. My uncle's parents are also in different countries, taking care of their other children's babies.

There are multiple reasons I am against the idea, since a child being taken away from his mother so young is probably pretty detrimental to his well-being. Also, we are simply not in a position to take care of another infant, even if we do have a maid. Me and and my parents often fight. It's just not a healthy environment to raise a child.

Okay that doesn’t mean much to me, but whatever floats your boat. But I’ve been able to bypass that because I’m going to leave soon for my career field. 

But today, I had to confront her on how she spoke to me. She spoke to me in a very rude manner and tone when I made an innocent mistake to which even our boss said it was his fault for not clarifying. So I kindly pulled to her to the side and asked, “did you hear how you spoke to me?” And that’s when she goes off. I explained to her that I didn’t appreciate how she spoke to me and that it made me feel uncomfortable, but somehow she flipped the script and said I should know her better and that I offended her. Now usually I would be heated because for one I hate disrespect in any form, but this time I just shrugged my shoulders and said okay. And to make things worse she lied to our boss saying she was leaving early, but she stayed out of anger and she doesn’t know that every time she talks behind my back those same people who she talked to comes back and tells me everything, like calling me hard headed.

But, he brought that attitude with him when buying my engagement ring and I've ended up with a very fancy, diamond ring that I do not like at all.

I met this girl crying near where me and my friends usually hang out. I'll call her Ruby, not her real name but for her, and our, own safety, if any reddit nerds somehow recognize this and know me. I came up to her and asked if she was okay and all that, y'know, as most people would do, and I've recognized her from years before, as she used to be in my classes. I invited her to hang out with us, she accepted and she was so happy. But there was an issue, she kept on crying. Day after day, she cried, claimed that we were toxic, and then got comforted by staff (while staff was giving me dirty looks, which ruined my reputation with most staff members as they used to enjoy me.) It made me upset, and I shared my frustrations with my friends and they agreed that they felt the same way. Day after day, week after week, Ruby kept crying, trauma dumping, and then calling us toxic when we didn't know how to comfort her, as most of the group is already very unstable and they cannot hold her problems as well as theirs.



I've been a huge fan of My Chemical Romance, and it just keeps growing every day ever since like 4 months ago, because I used to just,,, like their songs but now it's an obsession. I love everything about them, I love their songs, I love their interviews, I love Gerard Way, I love Frank Iero, I love Ray Toro, I love Mikey Way.. You get the point. I'm so insanely interested in their band, their upbringing, their interviews, silly fun or not so fun facts in songs, the slightest mention of My Chemical Romance makes me so insanely happy



So, y'know, one day I asked if ruby was okay, and she yelled ""I'm NOT okay I'm NEVER OKAY!!"", and that, obviously, turned on a switch for me. I started singing I'm Not Okay, and she wasn't so thrilled by this, to say the least. I've been so tired of her constantly doing that, and I'm one of the only stable enough people in my friend group to at least try to comfort her, so I usually try to get her into a comfortable spot and let her talk out her feelings, its usually the same thing and same excuses when I offer advice, or sometimes even comfort. She also talks about these ""rumors spreading around"" about her but I've never heard anything about it, and I'm usually a messenger of these said rumors. I know a lot. She kept calling me toxic even more and insulted me even more and then, one day, maybe around a week or less, she just,, shut off, she just stopped everything, she dropped everything, and I do, heavily, believe I'm the asshole. She just stopped. She has always had a lot of emotions, even if they were mostly negative, and I just see a lifeless body when I look at her now.

50,1fwgq7a,AITA for going looking at my own phone?,"Edit: I've had some downvotes, so I'd like to say that I think it is good my mom is making a donation, just I think she shouldn't keep secrets.

So basically, I'm a teen with an older sibling. My phone is my mom's hand down one, so she is still signed in with her email stuff.

She one day told me she was gonna leave for a meeting with her work things, which is a 1 hour drive from where she lives. She said she would be back in 1 and a half hour. I thought this was strange, since she would have to take at least 2 hours back and forth. But I let it alone.

Then, on my calendar, I saw :

""Organ donation: 3 PM""

An email also was sent to her inbox which I could see on my phone:

""Just a reminder, please do (whatever...) for your organ donation today at 3 PM""

I went on google maps and it would take a 15 minute drive to the center. I told my elder sister, and she said mom had already told her. She peresuaded me to tell mom.

I told my mom  like, I found an organ donation booking on your emails.

She said it was none of my buisness. I told her, ok, then why tell me it was for work?

She said ""I just want to ok? Stop being a detective.""

I then made this post and felt like I shouldn't be looking at my own calendar, and my own phone so my mom could keep secrets from me. This was actually a bit of a surprise, because she had never really lied before.

Edit: My mom told me not to sign out of her stuff as a backup if her phone is broken.

53,1fwgcy2,AITA for refusing to go to my wife's brothers wedding?,"Hi, all.

I have been married for 2,5 years to my wife. My wife is 27 and I am 28. 
My wife's brother is getting married in late november. 
In the beginning, we had a somewhat distant relationship, but we became friends. To the point that he frequently visits our apartment. And we also hang out without my wife.


My problem isn't with my brother-in-law. It's with the woman he is marrying. I'll call her Glenda from now on. Glenda is my ex-girlfriend. I have let him know as soon as he mentioned her for the first time, but he decided to continue dating her. 


Glenda and I didn't part ways on the best of terms. Our relationship was an emotional rollercoaster that was emotionally draining. She had an irrational fear that I would leave her completely alone, emotional outbursts, self esteem issues and anxiety. 


I am a pretty calm person and tried to deal with it and reassure her. In the end, it didn't matter. I found out that she cheated on me multiple times, with multiple people. After alot of crying from her, I told her we were done. I gave her the legally required time to move out of my apartment.


She proceeded to steal my late grandmother's diamond ring and maxed out my credit card that I had given to her (should have asked it back immediately). Leaving me with 3k debt. 


Then she told lies about me to everyone who would listen, I was a shitty boyfriend, used drugs, was lazy and psychotic. 


I told my wife I'm not going to their wedding. I still have alot of negative feelings toward her. 
Glenda told my wife that she's been formally diagnosed with borderline and has been in therapy for some time and that she's also taking medication. Apparently she's doing better. 
Ever since they started dating we have had very little contact, mostly because of me.

My wife called me an ass for not going to her brothers wedding with her. Saying she is disappointed in me and that I shouldn't dwell on the past too much. ",0.0,0.033963315,0,1

55,1fwg70l,WIBTA for learning Spanish after an uncomfortable conversation with my fiancé’s family friend?,"I (28F) am engaged to a mixed-race Mexican man, JJ (33M). While planning our destination wedding for Mexico we hit a snag over something I didn’t think would be a big issue: learning Spanish.

JJ grew up in the U.S. and only knows basic Spanish. He’s conversational at best, but he’s always felt insecure about it. His parents speak some Spanish, but his whole family is very Americanized, and his siblings don’t speak Spanish at all. Whenever we visit his extended family in Mexico, the language barrier is always present. 

I’m not fluent in Spanish either, but I’ve been trying to learn because I hate feeling completely clueless when we’re visiting. We get stared at often and I know I stand out because I’m Black, and JJ says they’re just not used to seeing people like me. He might be right, but it still feels uncomfortable, especially when “negra” is thrown around, and while it’s technically not offensive, the way it’s said sometimes feel off.

During a recent trip, we attended his grandfather’s birthday party and JJ’s family is always welcoming. It's  easy to have fun with them despite the language barrier. At the party a family friend, likely a tio, came up to me, and he was kind. He made an effort to include me, but he was clearly drunk and struggling a bit with his words.

Tio started asking me about JJ, and at first, I thought he was just being curious about how we met. But then he asked about JJ’s size. As in, whether he was “big” and it was obvious the conversation was derailing. I couldn’t really do anything but act like I didn’t understand. 

Eventually, Tio walked off but as he left I overheard him say something that sounded like “nos putes” (not sure about the spelling on this?) I know “puta” means “whore” and hearing something that sounded close to it made me uncomfortable, like maybe the whole conversation had been sexual in nature and now I was being judged.

I didn’t want to overreact, but I mentioned it to JJ, and he reminded me that CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING in Spanish. The next day he said he talked to his dad and the mentioned Tio, he explained that the phrase meant something like “she’s with him/you” or “she’s his/yours” Essentially just acknowledging that I'm in a relationship. 

I felt embarrassed for jumping to conclusions, but at the same time, it still left me feeling uneasy. I suggested that maybe we should both learn more Spanish, especially slang, so we could understand what’s being said around us better. JJ didn’t like that idea at all. He said learning more Spanish would only make me paranoid and hyper-aware of things that maybe don’t matter or that I’d start picking apart everything people said. 

He also doesn’t want to be that one couple to make his family uncomfortable by being ""overly sensitive"" beacuse apparently that's a thing in Mexican culture.

57,1fwg174,AITA for starting arguments with my boyfriend?,"TLDR: I (21) have been starting arguments with my boyfriend (29) lately because I forget to update him on what I'm doing, continuously agitating him.

We've been together for 4 years (LDR) and have a relationship dynamic where he leads and I follow, as I’m more of a homebody and very anxious. He usually makes decisions for us because he’s intelligent and I trust him 100% to make right decisions (since his judgment is usuailly correct), but when I hesitate or forget something, he gets angry, he raises his voice, he swears at me, and it's just scary to be there in the moment. He often tells me I don’t need him if I act “independently” without updating him.  

Recently, he’s been upset that I take 2-3 hours to eat breakfast and dinner, since he thought it took too long. I started a new diet with my family to help with health issues, and I didn’t think to explain it fully until it was brought up. Today, he said he didn’t want to talk because of the argument about me not telling him what kinds of foods I was eating (and why it took so long for me to come back so we could talk again), and he just told me he didn't want to talk today. My MS flares up a lot from stress, but if I mention that during arguments, it just makes him want to leave the call. Sometimes he’ll raise his voice, and I get scared and go quiet, which makes him even more upset, making me panick more. Even the other day. 

The other day, he asked suddenly if I thought he was ""mean"", referring to when we have arguments, and it stumped me because I don't think he is, but he can be a little intimidating in the times we have fights. It's easy to tell when he's upset, he becomes vague sometimes and distant, sometimes leaving to punish me.

He’s told me many times when we move in together, he'll make my life stress-free so my MS doesn’t flare, but it feels like I’m always messing up and making this stressful for us both and it wont be any better when were together. In these moments, I am just having a difficult time responding in the way he wants me to, or just being able to respond at all. I cry during a lot of our arguments, but I wouldn't be able to hide it when I move in with him. We stay up late because of our time difference and as much as I express that I feel achy because of the MS (staying up late does that), he guilt trips me into staying up later, and it'll be 1:00AM for him and 4:00AM for me, so I stay up, which I can say is my own decision, but it's still difficult since since always wake up with 4-5 hours of sleep, but that's only a problem since we have a 3 hour time difference between us.

I’m constantly worried he's going to send another lengthy message of him telling me he's contemplating breaking up with me after all this time (he deleted the last one so it gave me hope). I really want to be better for him,  for us and to improve, but I’m scared I won't be good enough and don’t know how to fix it. I have a strong feeling this will be all fine tomorrow and everything will be okay until my next mistake, but this weighs on my shoulders and I'm sure on his too.

58,1fwfrys,AITA Co Parenting Struggles ,"I (24M) met my wife (24F) when we were both 16, and our relationship has been a rollercoaster from the start. Despite our love, we faced many challenges, including cheating, dishonesty, and numerous makeups and breakups. We supported each other through significant hardships, such as the loss of family members and her experience of being homeless. By 2020, however, we found ourselves in a difficult situation. I expressed that I didn't want to get married due to the ongoing drama; I simply didn’t feel ready. But after a major argument involving her family, I reluctantly agreed, and we tied the knot. Just three months later, she became pregnant with our daughter, and I committed to supporting her both financially and emotionally to ensure she was comfortable during her pregnancy.

Once our daughter was born, the challenges resurfaced. A text that was meant for my wife accidentally went to a co-worker, which triggered a significant fight. She kicked me out for two days, we reconciled after my co worker explained the misunderstanding and I tried to repair our relationship by taking her on a vacation for her birthday. However, after that trip, things took a turn for the worse. She began going out more frequently, leaving me to care for our daughter after my long night shifts, or she would drop our child off with her mother so she could go out partying. Eventually, I discovered a video on her phone that showed her with another man in my car. This  marked the beginning of a troubling pattern where she began meeting up with various men and even brought them to our home.

This situation became unbearable, and I decided to move out and stay with my mom while continuing to care for my daughter. I left her the car and attempted to move on with my life. However, I now face significant struggles in establishing a relationship with my daughter. My wife and her family have restricted my access to her, having nothing but distrust of my family and later claiming they don’t trust me, especially now since her boyfriend and I don't get along well . This tension escalated after a video surfaced where my wife and her boyfriend were intimate on top of my daughter’s Christmas presents.

Although I have never harmed my daughter, they insist on supervising any time I spend with her. Each time I try to have parenting time, someone from her side—whether it’s her, her boyfriend, or a family member—is present. This situation is draining, and I feel increasingly isolated. My only desire is to build a meaningful relationship with my daughter and be a good father, but I feel like I’m being consistently pushed away at every turn.

60,1fwffjd,AITAH for trying to get my fiance to communicate ,"Me and my fiance were having somewhat of a nice night. He allows me to look through his phone and I stumbled across snapchat. I noticed he searched a name that was my sister's on there, which is weird to me, but my brain didn't go there, it just kind of looked like he was looking at other girls. I tried to ask him and communicate with him as to not stress myself, seeing as I'm also 8 weeks pregnant and high risk. He explained it weirdly and was stuttering suspiciously saying he was looking for my sister which was totally red flags to me. I even asked, if that was the case, why didn't you ask for my own sisters snapchat? I would've gladly given it.

I called back and told my ex that I could hear him asking to talk to me and that she needed to let him, which she did.

62,1fwf6bi,AITA for confronting my best friend and her fiancé after she backed out of our Amsterdam trip last minute?,"I’ve been planning a trip to Germany to visit a friend, and my best friend of 8+ years, let’s call her Sarah, invited herself along, saying she wanted to see a castle. She promised to get cheap flights through a “flight guy,” but turns out, the guy was a scammer. He took our money, and we never got the flights.

I rebooked my trip for this October and decided to add a week in Amsterdam. Sarah wanted to go, so I told her she could come to Amsterdam with me, and I’d head to Germany afterward. Sarah agreed, and since she had sold me her iPad and covered a flight for me in the past, I offered to buy her flight ($613) as repayment. When the price went up to $909, I covered it without asking her for the difference.

Today, less than two weeks before the trip, Sarah tells me she can’t go because her fiancé said no. She had ignored his concerns about a previous trip, and now he doesn’t want her to go on this one. The tickets are non-refundable, and I don’t feel comfortable traveling alone to another country. Her fiancé offered to pay me back, but I’m really upset because I worked hard and did overtime to afford this trip, and this is the second time it’s been ruined.

Am I wrong for confronting her and being upset that she backed out so close to the trip?

My son spent 15 years in prison. He did a lot of work on himself while he was incarcerated. Became a very likeable human that has (I thought) a useable brain for doing good things. So when he was close to release I found him a cute little two bedroom house to rent. Very private. Lovely spot. Filled it with furniture and kitchen stuff and things he would need to get started. Took him to a car dealership and cosigned a vehicle for him because he got out with an excellent job making more money than I did. We talked almost daily as he lives a few hours from me. Would come to visit regularly. It was awesome for about a year. Then he met a prostitute. She had an addiction. She would stay at his house while he was at work and sometimes disappear for a couple days and then he would hunt her down and bring her back. He got so obsessed that he was constantly worried she was going to leave and wanted to put trackers on her phone. I tried to explain that normal people don't do this. She decided (I assume with his encouragement) to stop taking the drugs - fentanyl I think - and had a tough time kicking the habit. He quit his job to stay with her while she was at her worst. And she popped up pregnant. Surprise! What self-respecting prostitute doesn't use contraception? He lost the house because he couldn't pay the rent without a job, and they moved in with her mother and other family members. I was told early in the relationship that she has adult siblings that live in trailers on her mother’s property and deal drugs for their money. At the time he told me that, he made out like he was disgusted about that. Apparently not anymore. Anyway - Now, and since March, he has been ""looking"" for a job. I have made the car payments because I am primary. I have his phone on my family plan. He has a 20 yo  very special needs daughter that I have been paying for for 20 years. She used to spend every other weekend with me until she got older. Now she has other things to do with friends and such. Her mommy takes good care of her.

So here we are today with another car payment overdue and Mom made a phone call to the phone I pay for that he has possession of. I say tell me something good. He says he is trying to get things together so he can go to work. I ask where and he says he is going to cut down a tree for somebody. So I said not a real job? and he hung up on me.

His step father is all - but it's tough out there and he has a record and it isn't easy and there is a baby coming and waa. And I'm all - I don't care! I live on social security with very little savings. That's on me. But at 46 years old, he shouldn't need his mommy to pay his way.

Laila has an autoimmune condition. She was in remission for 8 years until having her 3rd kid. Childbirth triggered a severe flare up. She’s gotten blood transfusions, is on the maximum dose of 2 very strong medicines, and has a consultation scheduled to get a series of surgeries over the next year and a half. She is barely strong enough to make the 2 mile drive to the pharmacy. She can’t cook, take care of the house, work, or do much with the kids.

Then I pick the kids up and help Laila with them in whatever way she needs until Dylan gets home. Laila’s disability checks aren’t nearly what she used to make so I’ve also been helping out with the bills. 

Michael called me and asked if I could keep his kids during the day since I already have Dylan’s kids. I said no because I already have my hands full between Laila, the kids, and the house.

From October 18-19, I shared a hotel room with a girl I’ll call Z (19F) along with two other friends, R and L. The concert was at the Prudential Center in Newark, NJ, and I was lucky enough to get VIP 1 for day two, while Z had VIP 2. My friend O generously upgraded my day one ticket to VIP 2, which I then offered to Z for $260, with the understanding she would pay me back. I also covered her hotel fee of around $243, which we typically split, and I bought her a light stick for $70 at the concert. By this time, I had known Z for about six months, though we had never met in person. The trip costed Z around $573 which they owed me.



Initially, Z paid me back without issue for a few months but then stopped due to financial problems. I accepted that it might take a while longer, totaling $450 that she still owes me from last year. Since Z attended community college, I’m not sure what she was doing during the summer.



In early September, I reached out again, asking for a response or I’d have to take further action. After some back-and-forth, Z made excuses about not being able to work because of her mom. I get it; she’s 19 and still under some parental pressure. In my frustration, I made a DWAYOR post on Instagram asking for advice on the situation, as Z doesn’t have a large following and wouldn’t be significantly impacted.



I told Z in early September that I needed her to pay me back. On September 19, I asked for her parents’ contact information, and she provided an email that I’m unsure is real. I reached out, but when her mom didn’t promise payment, I requested Z to sign a loan agreement stating she would have the money by October 11. Z claimed she was waiting on her FAFSA check, which she said would arrive by the end of August. On September 27, she said the check had arrived and was deposited into Cash App, but I haven’t received anything.



I asked for the signed loan agreement by October 1, and Z questioned why it was needed if she was supposedly getting her money on October 4. Unsurprisingly, no money came in, so I insisted on the signed agreement. She did sign it but provided a half-hearted signature and only sent me screenshots of parts of the document without the complete form.

It was those grey Calvin Klein bras so I thought maybe it was just my religious upbringing plaguing my judgement. But she also sent him her bikini bottom tan lines and it just left a bad taste in my mouth. He always said they were jsut really close and it was normal. On another occasion he told me how his aunt used to joke about how big is weiner size is (censored). I was so shocked but didn’t say anything cause he also expressed how weird it was. The other day i had gone with him to find a suit for his cousins birthday and he was there with his aunt and cousins. I stayed for a little bit and left after a bit. The next day he told me to look at this group chat for his cousins birthday because there was a video of the choreographed dance. There I saw a picture of my boyfriend grabbing a mannequins breast. I was so weirded out. It would’ve been a different story if it was with his friends or something as a stupid joke but his aunt took that… and the worst part is that group chat has a bunch of 14 year old girls in there who aren’t even relatives. I obviously immediately told him I was so uncomfortable with that and he said it wasn’t unusual and his family was like that. But it just didn’t sit right with me knowing his aunt told him to do that and then took a picture and then sent it to a group chat with little girls. After arguing a bit he finally told his aunt to delete from the group chat at least. And she said she didn’t mean to send it in there and their family is different.

68,1fwe0b5,AITA: Am I the asshole for telling my friend not to get a puppy?,"
Am I the asshole for telling my friend not to get a puppy. My (32f) friend Evie (25f) recently bought her first house and wanted to rent out a room to help pay the mortgage so we decided that I would move in with my cat and to help put myself in a better financial position since living alone is expensive. Evie already has 2 indoor cats so initially I was nervous about making mine an indoor cat too and living in a house with 3 cats as I have allergies but I’m managing with antihistamines and if it gets too bad am looking into buying air purifiers. 

I only moved in a couple weeks ago and prior to moving Evie never mentioned wanting to get any more pets so I never thought much about it until a few nights ago she mentioned wanting a dog one day and I said it would be nice thinking she meant in the distant future until yesterday she messaged while at work saying she’s going to go meet a puppy on the weekend that she may adopt and asked if I want to come. I felt a bit blindsighted by it as I don’t really want a puppy at the moment and don’t have the bandwidth or energy to take care of a puppy. 

I work from home and she doesn’t and we don’t have a back yard or outdoor area to keep a dog so her plan is to keep it in a crate in the laundry all day while at work. Both myself and another friend mentioned feeling that’s too cruel but she’s adamant it’s fine as the crate will be like a little home for it but I personally don’t like the idea of a puppy being trapped in a crate for 8-9 hours a day for its life and worry that would cause health issues for it if it’s not let out to pee etc not to mention the impact on its mental health. Additionally as i currently work from home I would be the one hearing it bark and whine while I try to work which will likely upset me or distract me too much so I’d have to leave the house and go work from the company office everyday so I don’t want her thinking I’ll always be here to let the puppy out during the day. Especially as I’ve said I’m looking for a new job that likely won’t be wfh. 

To be honest if I had known in advance that she intended on getting a puppy then I wouldn’t have moved in as it’s just too much for me and my cat still spends most of her time hiding in my room from the other cats and isn’t settled in yet. I’ve told her no to the puppy for now at least but now she seems upset and I feel horrible - it’s her house and ultimately her decision but I hate to say that if she does get a puppy I’ll be looking to move out and will be upset that she’s put me in that position.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-05,"AITA: Am I the asshole for telling my friend not to get a puppy?

69,1fwdnpn,WIBTA if I made a relator write up a lease agreement only to tell him he took too long accepting my application and I decided to take another apartment?,"**Apartment 1** I saw last Friday $1,250 1 bed 1 bath

Pros: small balcony, tub (I don't use tub much anyway), last tenant stayed there 13 yr - so while relator may be not so great - that long of a previous lease is a good sign

Cons: no dishwasher or w/d I'd have to pay another $50 to do laundry away from home

**Apartment 2** saw today $1,350 1 bed 1 bath

Pros: dishwasher and newer looking front-load w/d in-unit

Cons: no outdoor space/ balcony, no tub

All else is equal: in location, both have hardwood floor

I toured **apartment 1** last Friday -wasn't even that relator the showed it, but his uncle. I liked it an submitted my application Monday. After 48hr of not hearing from the realtor, I messaged him: ""hey I sent my application 2 days ago. did you get it?"" No response for 3 hours. Wed morning I was getting annoyed. I knew I was a great applicant 780+ credit score, and the rent would be \~15% of my income. **I also noticed the apartment had been reposted advertising $1300.** So I felt he was dilly-dallying hoping he could potentially get a better offer/applicant while he kept me on the back-burner.

I don't blame him for trying to see what he can get, but I'm currently 1 hour away from the area I'm trying to move to. Takes 2.5 hours out of my day to look at a place. If he's taking his time to weigh his other options - why shouldn't I as well. I also have a big exam for work in 2 weeks so my time is valuable to me right now. I'm trying to not waste time so that I don't have to move after it starts to get cold here in the northeast.

In the mean-time this past Wed I saw **apartment 2** on apartments.com. I liked the amenities. For a $50 difference - considering cost to do laundry away from home - I called that relator immediately. We had a good discussion. I told him I'm waiting on my application for another place to get approved - and new realtor said he could be flexible on price. This new guy is much more responsive. I already gave him my application before seeing the place.  It's very nice.  I told him I'll take it and he even dropped the price to $1,325 for me.

Both guys are writing up the agreement now.  I should have it in hand from both guys this weekend.  Relator for **apartment 1** annoyed me though.  I was thinking of texting him once I have the offer for apartment 2: ""While I was waiting \~4 days for you to accept my application, all else equal I found another apartment for $1300 in the same area with w/d in-unit and a dishwasher. I sent my application for that place already on Wed and toured it Friday. I'll be taking that lease instead. Good luck!""

Might be an a\*\*hole thing to say especially as he's taking the time to write up the lease right now - maybe I can let him know before he finishes that, but this new guy seems way more excited to lease to me.

70,1fx3mfa,AITA for talking the way I did after his flirty comment to another woman,"I (30) and he (46) just went out tonight, it was scandalous to say the least. My boyfriend (and also father of my child) invited me to have a drink with his friends and among his friends was his ex wife too. I’m very open minded but when I arrived at the bar and realized he invited her without telling me I really did everything in my power to not show any anger. I like her so eventually I just started to relax and enjoy the evening. One of his girlfriends was wearing a leggings that looking like it was sheer but it wasn’t. He looked at her and told her « What kind of pants are those ? Did you went out like this ? » and she said « of course I did » he then added « noooo I can’t believe it, you can’t go out like this ». The tone was very flirty and it was right in front of me. She then pulled her leggings down to show that it was in fact double lined and not sheer….anyway. I was shocked but did my best to stay calm and classy as we were out as a family with our child. When we got home he asked me if something was wrong and I said I felt humiliated by his comment to his “friend” his response was “that was a joke” and after that everything I was thinking started to get out of my mouth. To give you exact context this is what I said: 

“You are too old to treat me like that in fact you were the oldest one there with the youngest most beautiful woman.

I do feel bad for pulling the age cards as well as my looks, but it’s a fact, I am very attractive and everyone always comment on this. I know 30 is not that young but I guess that was my weapon In this argument 🤣.

71,1fx3cse,AITA for not talking to my best friend for a month and a half?,"
This is quite a lengthy post, so I’ll go ahead and include the TLDR at the top 

TLDR: friend starts dating guy who is almost definitely using her as a rebound. Guy is very insecure (but not necessarily controlling(?)). Friend never reaches out first after she starts dating guy. I stopped reaching out and radio silence ever since 



I (21 f) have been best friends with “Erin” (20 f) since we were in 3rd grade together. For context, friend is a manager at a business and works roughly 60-70 hrs/week. During the school year (except for breaks), I’m away at college, so we don’t really see each other as often. 

Around mid-summer, Erin gets introduced to  “Mitch” (23(?)m). Mitch recently broke off an engagement in either late May or early June. Previously, he has been with the girl for around 2 years I think my friend said. Anyhow, Mitch and Erin start talking romantically **eleven** days after Mitch calls off the engagement. From what I can gather, he seems like a good guy, but the brevity of it all rubs me the wrong way. 

Erin tells me she’s happy and I say I’m happy for her, but the closeness in time of everything makes me uncomfortable. She said she saw that as the only red flag. For context, I was on the opposite end as her around a year ago. Got out of a 1+ year long relationship, got with someone not even 2 weeks later, broke up with rebound in less than a month and the guilt of (unintentionally) being all over someone and then not being able to stand them still haunts me. Erin and I FaceTimed later that night and I tried to convince her to give it a few months before they continue talking romantically because I don’t want her to fall into the same issue that my rebound fell into. She went to tell that to him, and they they decided that Mitch is ready for a relationship, so they soon start dating. 

By the end of the month, Erin and Mitch are officially dating. Erin says things are moving really fast for her, but she really likes Mitch so it’s okay and she’s happy to take things at his pace. Part of me is so happy for her because it’s taken her a long time to grow comfortable in herself enough to get into a relationship. Part of me is also concerned that Mitch might do what I did soon, which is eventually ending up breaking her and ruining her confidence (Erin is the type to take it personally). 

Now to the story: since Erin and I are so close, we can send each other really personal pics and it not be weird. I sent Erin a video of me (post weight loss) in my underwear and a t shirt. I was wanting to share my progress with her because I was really proud. She congratulated me, yada yada. That’s the end of that for now

Additionally, I had texted Erin some about my experience with my rebound relationship and I warned her that I could see a lot of the signs. Ultimately, I made sure to emphasize that I wasn’t gonna get in her business and I was just trying to give her a warning. She is her own person and I’m not trying to change that. I’d give her my support whether she chose to date him or not 

It’s now around early August at this point. I’ve asked her multiple times to hang out throughout the summer, since I’ll be off to college soon. We would always get right to the point of her being like “I’m off x day”. And I would try to schedule further and I’d stop getting any sort of responses. I figured she was busy, but it happened often and I was getting frustrated, but I knew that wasn’t a smart choice because we are both adults and we both get busy. (We ended up hanging out once at the very start (help me w something) and once at the very end of summer (bday party)). 

One day, Mitch was feeling particularly insecure and asked to look through Erin’s phone, even tho she would never do anything suspicious. Mitch was scrolling through our conversations. He saw the message about him potentially using Erin as a rebound, and that made him upset. Honestly, I don’t really blame him for that one. I’d prob feel upset as well. Then he saw the weight loss video of me in a t shirt and underwear. He accused Erin of cheating on me (which I honestly found humorous since that’s not the first time people have thought we were dating lol, we’re just two people who are really good platonic friends). Erin told him no ofc she’s not cheating and Erin asked me to prove it. So I typed out to Erin for proof yada yada. 

It’s felt like pulling teeth trying to have a convo with Erin. In short, I told Erin that I missed her a lot and I missed getting to talk to her. I noticed it’s been a lot harder to have a conversation with her lately. She said she was sorry and she’s been so busy talking with Mitch because he works for the same chain and he understands her problems better than anyone else (which I get where she’s coming from). What made me upset was that she had time to hang out with him multiple days after work and texted him constantly. I was feeling sort of butt-hurt, even though I know it’s a new relationship thing that’s quite common. 

I (being a little jealous) brought it up again to Erin that I really missed her and I was wondering if we could find ways to talk a little more, even if it was just a 15 minute call once a week. She said sure and she was sorry for not reaching out at much. For about a week, we were back to our regular selves where we would text each other intermittently throughout the week (all with me reaching out first). It made me curious what would happen if I just stopped reaching out first.

Surely, she’d message me back in a week or two. Nope. As of now, it’s been over a month and a half without us talking at all. Part of me feels justified because I feel like I’ve done what I can, part of me feels guilty because I am essentially just completely “ignoring” my friend. Am I the asshole for refusing to contact her unless she tries first? ",TL;DR,2024-10-05,"AITA for not talking to my best friend for a month and a half?

Erin told him no ofc she’s not cheating and Erin asked me to prove it. So I typed out to Erin for proof yada yada. 

It’s felt like pulling teeth trying to have a convo with Erin. In short, I told Erin that I missed her a lot and I missed getting to talk to her. I noticed it’s been a lot harder to have a conversation with her lately. She said she was sorry and she’s been so busy talking with Mitch because he works for the same chain and he understands her problems better than anyone else (which I get where she’s coming from). What made me upset was that she had time to hang out with him multiple days after work and texted him constantly. I was feeling sort of butt-hurt, even though I know it’s a new relationship thing that’s quite common. 

I (being a little jealous) brought it up again to Erin that I really missed her and I was wondering if we could find ways to talk a little more, even if it was just a 15 minute call once a week. She said sure and she was sorry for not reaching out at much. For about a week, we were back to our regular selves where we would text each other intermittently throughout the week (all with me reaching out first). It made me curious what would happen if I just stopped reaching out first.

Surely, she’d message me back in a week or two. Nope. As of now, it’s been over a month and a half without us talking at all. Part of me feels justified because I feel like I’ve done what I can, part of me feels guilty because I am essentially just completely “ignoring” my friend. Am I the asshole for refusing to contact her unless she tries first? ",,0.02606991119682789,0,0

74,1fx39cx,AITA for telling my fiancé to put himself before his mom ,"My fiancé TJ (31M) has a rocky relationship with his mom. Both of his brothers do as well due to past emotional and psychological trauma she has inflicted on all of them. We’ve been together for over 7 years and we recently welcomed a new baby. I know my fiancé hates his mom with a passion. He’s been very clear about his stance on her for years because she has done so many horrible things to him and his family. 

To name a few, she’s constantly manipulating them into being on her side before and after she divorced his dad (lying about him stealing from them when they were kids) she’s constantly degrading everyone but herself (at anyone’s birthday or event we go to she will go off on them for eating cake by calling them fat but shes allowed to if she wants to) she’s only concerned with her own health ( if TJ goes to the ER she will call me to tell me her foot hurts and go on an hour rant about it then say oh is he okay). 

I am personally disgusted with her as a person and a mom because of all her actions. TJ told me she refused to put them above her dogs so they got luxury everything and they didn’t get anything compared. All her attention went to them instead of her kids growing up. Recently our son started had to go to the ER for a minor emergency and so we told TJ’s mom what happened and she didn’t bother to call us or ask what happened. A week later our son began to crawl so we texted her again. Her response was to send us an article of bear sighting and how she was so worried about it.

TJ flipped to say the least because for the 100th time he’s mentioned he’s sick of her and wants to cut her off completely. He wanted my opinion on what he should and I was honest. I told him I hate that woman and all she’s done to him and his brothers. I hate how she has hurt and continues to hurt him. Watching him continue a relationship with her out of pity has been something I stayed out of because it’s his decision not mine. Now that he’s asking for my opinion I gave it to him but I think he wants to take it. I think he needs therapy and to move on from her abuse because it’s taking a toll on him.

76,1fx2w3v,AITA for disappearing on a friend when she was on holiday?,"My friend (30F) and I (32M) have been close for about 3 years. We have so much in common and she really is one of the most caring people I know and I’ve opened up to her about so much in my life such as trauma and mental health struggles. She has also opened up so much to me too and one thing she struggles with most is loneliness and social isolation after moving to my town 3 years ago and finding it hard to navigate the cliquey city we live in. 

This year I’ve taken on a stressful new role and I’ve been finding it hard to navigate balancing my rocky mental health and work and friendships. I admit that I do have a lot of friends and I also have adhd so I tend to forget about certain people and can be a bit of a mess remembering to reply or follow up or make plans. I also struggle with depression and ptsd and I have a tendency to self isolate and push people around me away in these times or I will try to escape this through going out and partying with friends of mine.

Over the last year my friend has raised that she has found my isolating behaviours hurtful twice now. She says that she feels like I really disregard her when I isolate and that I become very short and cold with her and unresponsive. I have explained my situation with my work and mental health, but she says that she sees me posting lots on my social media with me out at social events and gatherings, however a lot of this is me just running away from my problems and engaging in substance misuse (yes I’m in therapy at the moment trying to address all of my shit). We have managed to talk things through on the two occasions she raised this with me, but I have felt a bit apprehensive that she’s putting some excessive pressure on me and holding me to unrealistic standards because she is lonely and doesn’t have many other people she can rely on.

Things have kinda gone downhill because she recently went on a 3 month trip to Europe on her own and I was quite active on following up with her over the first month but my mental health really declined badly after and when she got back a month ago she messaged to let me know she just got home and I didn’t have have the capacity to respond so I left her on delivered. A couple of weeks went by and I avoided looking at my messages from her but was chatting with other friend’s and liking their posts. Eventually I did read her messages when my mental health had stabilised and she was very anxious, telling me she felt rejected and that she was so confused that I was ghosting her. 

She also told me that she felt hurt that I didn’t show much interest in the stuff she posted or make an effort to talk to her while she was away but I was posting photos of me partying/socialising all the time.

I spoke with my boyfriend about it and I requested him yo talk to her and stop doing that. I don't like it....that's it, because it doesn't feel natural welcoming for me. 
Recently when we went to drop of kids to their home, awcourse he made kind of awkward situation but there was no kiss and no hug. Later that evening his ex requested a conversation with my boyfriend. When he called, she was upset of why he doesn't welcome her appropriately. He told her that I don't like that and that i told him that he can't welcome her like that. Awcourse I would handle this situation differently but I feel like he put me in a bad position. From the other side ...I don't care...yes I requested him to stop doing it.

78,1fx2kyh,WIBTA for being disturbed that my father won't consider bringing our animals in a storm related evacuation?,"Well, as I said, my father won't consider saving our family pets in a hurricane. He has always shown dislike toward our pets, even though we have permission, and he's helped get most of them. Currently, we have 3 dogs and 3 cats. I, 17f, personally have a dog and 2 cats in my room 24/7, their my babies. Note that he and my mom both pay for all their needs, food, and flee meds (occasionally). I'm concerned that I could be overeacting by being against leaving them at home if we evacuate for an upcoming tropical storm / hurricane. I just feel like it's worth the 10-20 minutes it would take to load them up in one of the 2 working cars we have. Would I be the a**hole if I don't leave without them, in case we do need to leave? I'm just lost, I don't know if I'm just being overly emotional over pets or if I'm in the right? Also, we have several days until the next storm, so it's not like we are short on time or anything. I just can't understand why he gets so angry at the thought that I, and my siblings and mum, would want to save them from drowning / dying? 


Added to answer some questions: 

No, we have never flooded or really been affected during these storms. And I'm not saying that he's wrong for wanting to prioritize his family first. But I think we should at least make plans and prepare for the worst, which he seems to worry about the most. He gets all this extra food and supplies for us people, but can't even talk about keeping the animals safe? I just don't get it, but I could be wrong?

It doesn't seem to me like a stress / all the responsibility falls on his shoulders type of issue. To me, it seems purely dismissive. Like, ""Why should I be bothered to try to bring these animals anywhere. We'll just lock them in the house and hope for the best."" We've lived in a hurricane prominent area for over 5 years now, and his answer has never changed. Mind you, this was back when we had only 2 dogs and were a 4-person family. We literally moved halfway across the country with one of the dogs, just to leave it in a hurricane? He's also the type of person to hold on to something that he's put money into. So I don't see how the animals, which I admit are expensive at times, are any different. I have a nagging feeling that it's just to rile us up, (me, my mom, and younger brother?) Maybe he wants us to be stressed over the fact we MIGHT have to leave them behind? I'm just lost.

I didn’t talk with him much anymore because of the time difference, but my mom, who we’ll call Gina, always tells me that Chad is getting better, and that I should talk to him more. I didn’t feel comfortable with that, because when he got scammed, my mom and him always got into fights because of it, even if they were already divorced. I felt betrayed by him, in a way. So the distance was already there to separate us. I didn’t feel like putting in effort to contact him anymore.

I didn’t talk with him much anymore because of the time difference, but my mom, who we’ll call Gina, always tells me that Chad is getting better, and that I should talk to him more. I didn’t feel comfortable with that, because when he got scammed, my mom and him always got into fights because of it, even if they were already divorced. I felt betrayed by him, in a way. So the distance was already there to separate us. I didn’t feel like putting in effort to contact him anymore. Gina always told me that I should call him, but I feel like it’s a two way street, that he should contact me first, but Gina says that I’m not being very realistic.

80,1fx25de,AITAH: I expressed my frustration when my wife recommended we scrap the vacation plans I made for us. ,"My wife (37F) and I (34M) will be celebrating our 10th anniversary. This year, I was asked to do the planning for a getaway. My wife has been the one to plan itineraries for vacations. I have planned before, but along with her, and she usually wants to have a lot of input on the specifics. I vacation differently, and can be happy anywhere as long as I can sit down with a drink in hand. she can be more fastidious.

So, our dynamic when we vacation is that I defer to what she would like, and I try to stay in budget and work overtime. I make enough to support our family on a single income and have the opportunity to work extra hours when needed for occasions. 

We had talked about it months before, and she thought it would be nice if I planned things for a change. I was excited by this. My wife can be rather specific when it comes to vacations and meeting her expectations would be a challenge … but, being able to take her away on a romantic getaway where everything is taken care of and she can really enjoy herself, seemed to be a very romantic gesture. 

She sent ideas of what she would like and there was a lot of rural/luxurious B&B venues. I took this feedback, found something that she did not send me but fit the theme. The place we would be staying was a bit pricier, but came with a lot of amenities. I made reservations at a few spots and took off work, allowing us 5 days. 

Prior to finalizing our lodging plans a few weeks prior, I sat down with her to review and confirm dates. the only input I was looking for was which room she would prefer, between a couple of premium suites that they offer. 

She was impressed, though the choice of which suite was a process and she had to do her research. she picked the suite she wanted. As I’m about to pay, she states:

“I just feel if we are going to spend this much money, we can find some flights and do something adventurous.”

I already had other arrangements set. I was a little shocked and processed what she said. She starts looking up flights and goes into her vacation planning zone. 

I thought I had succeeded in planning our 10th, and she is talking about how to use my 5 days off better. I felt that my plans were seen as sub par, and I decided in the moment to discuss this with her. I told her:

“I feel a little hurt that you are replacing the plans I had already made.”

I explained how she had asked me to do this. I asked her if she saw something wrong with my plans, and she said no - and why she felt our 5 days could be utilized differently. She felt she had to “be honest about how she thought we could spend our five days.” I finished our disagreement with this:

“If you would like to plan a different, more adventurous vacation for another time, you are welcome to do so. But, for this one, I am moving forward with the plans I made.” 

I then submitted the payment for my plans. She was a bit put off by that. 
She started to cry and has been withdrawn towards me.

My mom is uncomfortable because the 10-year-old keeps saying that she has a crush on him, which is obviously untrue. 

My mom has mentioned this to my aunt, but my aunt just laughs it off, saying “he’s just a boy.” The kid has even said things like “it’s illegal, and I’m going to report you to the cops,” which embarrassed my mom, so she walked away to avoid confrontation. During a family party, the kid took out a toy gun, pointed it at my mom, and kept saying, “Why aren’t you staring at me?

My 38f and my ex husband 40m have a great co-parenting relationship. We've been divorced for 5 years and have two kids 10m and 13f. We split custody 50/50, we have a no-child support arrangement that works for us, we communicate well and our kids are thriving. We have been commended several times for our co-parenting success. I wouldn't say we're friends, we only talk about things pertaining to the kids...but we get along, we agree on most things with the kids and we have never spoken negatively about the other to the kids. 

Here's where I might be the a-hole. 3 years ago I remarried and my husband 38m has terrible insecurity issues. It manifests the most when it comes to my ex. My son's birthday is on Valentines day. I like to see my kids on their actual birthdays at least for a short time if they are with their dad. This means every Valentines day is a fight because my husband INSISTS that I don't go ""hang out with my ex"" on Valentines day. *He's always invited to come along.* His argument is that I can see the kids later and I don't need to see them ON their birthdays. Which I don't totally disagree with, but my mom heart hates it. I don't spend hours with them, just enough to drop off a gift and love on them a little bit. As they get older it probably won't always be that way. It's hard missing half of their lives. I know that's the choice I made. But since I've been married it's been accusations of cheating, snide comments when I go to pick up my kids and fights about how I don't care how my husband feels. It's not that I don't care! I'm stuck between my children and a jealous husband. It's not about my ex, I just want a healthy relationship for my kids. 

Just today, my ex came to pick up my son (he was with daughter at soccer and I was with son at football) for his weekend and my son wanted to show his dad something in his room. After that my ex sat and chatted for about 20 minutes about the soccer game/foot ball game and then they left. My husband was in the room the whole time and chatted some. When they left my husband looked at me and said ""I don't want him hanging out in my house like that anymore."" This went on and on. When I tried explaining that I don't see the issue with it he just got more angry and stopped the conversation. He keeps claiming I don't care about his feelings and when I try to explain that I DO, but also I'm just having what I think is a healthy co-parenting relationship, he shuts the convo down and won't talk about it. I am stuck. I want to respect my husband but also see no harm in having  a 20 minute visit in my house.

I (now 30M) grew up a very happy life with a single mother. Original lived in the United Kingdom when my parents were married, but when they got divorced when I was the age of 5 back in 2000 my mother decided to move back to her home country of South Africa.

Details of the divorce were always opaque, despite my father maintaining an extremely healthy relationship with me regardless of the distance barrier. My parents for as long as I can remember never got along which I was content with (since this had always been the norm.)

My father remarried early on and I gained a step brother and a half brother, as well as a step mother which against all odds I have amazing relationships with and would even go as far as to say I regard them as biological relatives.

However. I recently saw the original divorce agreement between my parents which stated that my father needed to legally pay for my tertiary education. Since I was educated in the UK, this amounted to £32K plus expenses.

I live a relatively successful life already thanks to said education and am fortunate enough to have paid off all of my university debt. With that said, I feel entirely conflicted over this situation.

After I graduated I naturally moved home with my father in the UK whilst I tried to find a job. After 3 months he started charging me a small amount of rent in increments each month as an incentive to get a move on and make a living for myself. This has only added to my conflict.

No problem. I’m always willing to help anyone with general advice and recommend good resources.

Nope. It turns out that Karly wants an on-demand tutor. She will text me a picture of her coursework and caption it “How do I do and show work for this problem? It’s due in two hours.” My response was always, “Um, NO?” and that I’m not doing her work.

Karly does not take the message and will keep sending me her coursework. The last straw was this week after Karly texted asking me to put together an exam review for her chemistry exam the next morning. I told Karly that I’m not even going to reply back to these texts.

Karly argued that there’s no help for her at school. I told Karly tough. Clearly, she’s already beginning to figure out that what she did in high school won’t work anymore.

89,1fx0hez,AITA for telling my flatmate he is overreacting because he wants to move out over a mouse,"I live in a shared flat with two flatmates. Recently, we spotted a mouse in the kitchen, but it seems to only be hanging out behind the washing machine and under the sink. We have prevented it from reaching the countertop, put in place mice traps, and kept all food sealed away as well as the kitchen clean. The biggest annoyance has been its excrement in the cupboard under the sink. Now since we have taking measures, we haven’t noticed any droppings, and we haven’t seen the mouse for over a week now.

Despite this, my flatmate is freaked out and wants to move out. I understand mice can be unsettling, but we’ve taken steps to keep the kitchen clean, and it seems like it was just one mouse that likely is gone. It has reached the point my flatmate refuses to go in, or use, the kitchen. He gets breakfast outdoors, food outdoors and takes his washing to a nearby laundromat.

I feel like this is a bit of an overreaction and told him this, especially since we’ve dealt with it and it seems like the mouse is gone now. Ideally I don’t want to leave this place but I haven’t been able to convince him, and due to costs of living if he relocates, I’ll more than likely have to relocate with him or find an alternative as well.

90,1fx08rh,AITA if I don't go to a concern tonight that my friend offered me tickets to after it became clear in order to get the tickets I'd need to hang out with her and her cousins for several hours beforehand?,"We are all in our late thirties. 

Three weeks ago my best friend told me that her cousins were visiting and they had extra tickets to go to a concert in town. She asked if I wanted to come. I said yes. 

She messaged me today to tell me that I needed to come over to her house at 5:20 because they were all going to dinner at 6:20. The concert is at 7:30. I didn't expect this and had not budgeted time in my day to be at her house at 5:20.

I had also not budgeted money. I am on a tight budget and eat out once a week. She invited me on Tuesday to go out with her roommate to eat. I did. That was my splurge for the week.

I was confused by her texts because she kept revising the same I needed to be there from 6:30, to 4:20, and finally to 5:20. I sent her a text saying, ""Hey, I'll just meet you at the concert, if that's OK.""

Her response was, ""Well. Then how are you going to get her ticket?""

Ok.

This ""concert"" is just on a small field behind a fence so logically two ways I could get a ticket is 1) be there when they arrive 2) text one of them to pass me the ticket through the fence. It's hard to read tone on text but I kind of interpreted that as a, ""You're not getting the ticket unless you're here for the entire ride"" thing. 

If that is what is going on I do understand her frustration that it seems I just want to show up for the event and not for the hang-out before hand, but truth be told, it's a little weird to me she expects/wants her friend to hang out with her cousins. They're not my cousins? Like I'm not a sister that is snubbing family here. And I hoped that she would have picked up on the fact maybe a dinner isn't in my budget right now but it seems she did not. 

I sent a text that read, ""Hi, sorry (friend), but eating out twice this week really isn't in my budget. But I totally understand if we can't coordinate a ticket drop off! I know we are both super busy."" No response yet. 

To be perfectly candid, I have no interest in the concert at all and was just going because my friend invited me! Now I just feel like I don't want to go even more because this now feels transactional. So even if she suggests a ticket drop off, I want to say no. Which means the ticket will be wasted.

91,1fx052z,AITA for being frustrated with my wife behavior?,"I need some perspective to figure out how I should be dealing with my current situation.

Background: I work from home and my work is base on productivity (I only work half the year overall). My wife is a stay at home mom, we have 1 kids, and one on the way (8 months pregnant).

My wife doesn’t plan ahead. For example, she can’t figure out what to buy in a grocery store because she can’t figure out what she wants to cook for the week. Or she can’t decide where she wants to eat for dinner at 10 am in the morning because she isn’t hungry.

I am definitely a type A personality, who likes to plan things ahead of time. We also have a nanny that comes in for 3 hours about 3-4 times a week to watch my son while we get stuff done.

Issue/Conflict: While I understand pregnancy is hard, I try to accommodate as much as I can. Until inevitably I break down over the stress of handling everything. I would do most of the dishes, cook at least half the meals, giving the my son his bath, putting him down to sleep and cleaning up the house.

Where I usually break down is when she will always says she needs to rest after taking care of our son for the morning. During his nap, she would spend her time eating, texting and playing games. She may try to rest in the last 30 minutes before our son wakes up.

But if she doesn’t get any sleep, she would rest when the nanny comes or I would assume the responsibility of taking care of our son before the start of my work (evening shift).

Then at night, she would always do the same thing (chat, game and eat) plus doing the leftover dish. On occasions, she would do the laundry. But it is always last minute, leading to going to bed at midnight, and the cycles get’s worst because she doesn’t have good sleep.

I always eventually get frustrated with the wasted time and shouldering more and more responsibility. Then we fight and everything resets. But the cycle always continue where I start to do more and more.

About three years ago, my mom (52F) was nearly scammed on WhatsApp. When I (29F) explained it was a scam, she confronted the scammer, and he “admitted” his wrongdoing. I asked my brother to block the number, and I thought it was over. However, months later, I discovered they were still talking and had formed a friendship. They discussed everything from Nigeria’s economy to cultural cuisines. It wasn’t romantic, but a pen-pal style friendship. She promised not to send him money or talk to him if he asked for it.

A year later, she confessed she had been sending him a monthly stipend for medical care and to support his family. I was horrified because she’s financially unstable, and I already help her and my younger brother (24M) make ends meet. She defended her decision, saying it was her way of making a positive impact.

Recently, my mom finalized her divorce from my father, who was abusive. The divorce was expensive, and she still owes her attorney. Last night, she dropped a bombshell: now that she’s divorced, she plans to marry her Nigerian friend so he can get a green card and support his family. I was shocked and immediately told her this was a terrible idea. She reassured me they’d keep finances separate, he’d only stay temporarily, and she’d get a prenup. They’d divorce once he was financially independent.

I told her this is marriage fraud and warned her of the legal risks. She insists she’s just helping a friend, and that I’m being overly negative. I know she’s going to do whatever she wants, and I told her I won’t be able to save her if things go wrong. She still plans to go through with it.

Now, I’m debating if I should report her to the authorities to stop her from going to Nigeria.

She was on TikTok when she gets a notification saying “username” has saved your video to favourites. She checks out the account and after looking through the following list she traces it back to her driving instructor, bear in mind my girlfriend is a 20 year old girl and her instructor is a 50 year old man.

Keep in mind that she has never shared her tiktok account information with him before and he’s either went out of his own way to find the account or he’s seen a pop up because he has her phone number which her account is linked too. When my girlfriend told me about this I felt sick with disgust and told her she should find another instructor (I offered her to take lessons with my instructor who I’ve been a lot happier with) but she insists on staying with her current instructor as her test is so soon.

I'm an academic musician and so is my S,O. We bought this apartment 5 years ago and everything has been very respectful with everyone. We even got to ""catsit"" for each other creating some friendships.1 year ago, my ex boss moved into the apartment below mine.  Everything went well for a while. Now my exboss loves to smoke spicy lettuce. We respect people doing whatever they like in their space. The problem is that he chosed to do it in the room below ours. Each room has a small sqared window for ventilation. So our room is constantly smelling like spicy lettuce. Another thing is that my exboss is constantly having ""arguments"" with his SO, sometimes I've had to contact the owner of the apartment and tell what's going on. You could hear everything. That had happened more than 4 times in less than a month. The last time, I was alone when it happened. It was really bad for how it sounded. I called another neighbor and went there to see if we could do something. When they opened, it looked like a tornado path, and my exboss heavy breathing, and looking like he just went and came back from hell, just looked at us and said: what do you want?
We just said that we wanted to know if everything was ok, he then grabbed what looked like an artisanal cuban habano, and light it. That thing was thick lol. After some more hits, he just looked at us and I thought he was going to run us. He came walking very fast towards us, but luckily, he just shut the door in our faces. We stood there for what it felt like 5 minutes in complete shock. Trying to understand what just happened. In my mind all I could think of was: is this the same guy I used to work with? I thanked my neighbor for joining me and we both went to our apartments. The next day as I was leaving for work, I run into him. He called me and asked for 1 minute to talk. I had time so I complied. I thought he was going to apologize but no. He was furious with me for not minding my own business and coming to his apartment. He called me a stuck up AH, and he knew I thought I was better than him. I stood there silent listening. I guess that made him more upset.When he was done, I just replied: you are definitely not the person I thought you were. We went down to check on you both, you have no idea how it feels to hear such a racket below you.we got scared. But don't worry, next time I won't knock on your door, im calling the c0ps so they can handle you both lettucesmokers (i used other words). My knees were shaking as I'm not a confrontational person And I left. The entire day I kept feeling bad for what I said and how I said it. I even though of apologizing but my SO told me: I'm glad I wasn't home that day and that you said what you said. I wouldn't have been that nice"" so people, IATA",Not the A-hole,2024-10-05,"AITA for calling out on my ex boss? Hi, please excuse me as english is not my native language.

98,1fwyshq,WIBTA for no longer doing “favors” for my disabled friend,"Ok so look -- I love my friend Mary (25F), who is physically disabled and uses a wheelchair. We've been friends since college and she's a nice person and we have similar interests, like going to concerts and events together, etc. However, being friends with Mary comes with a lot of challenges that have been harder to deal with the longer I've known her. Over the past few years, I've helped Mary with everything from moving her laundry from the washer to the dryer to helping her off the toilet. I know it's hard for her to ask for help and that she doesn't want to feel like a burden and I can't even imagine how difficult it is to ask for help with such intimate things. However, it feels like especially recently, everytime there's something she needs, the task ends up being far more complicated than she originally described. For example, she needed me to go pick up something large for her from a store, which was fine, because it's hard for her to pick things up, especially large things, in her chair. So you know, it's fine, I'm happy to help, that is until I went to two different stores and found that the only place that carries this thing is all the way across town, 30 min each way. And this isn't the first time a favor for her has ended up being much bigger. So -- would I be the asshole if I stop helping her, or at least do it much less often? I care about her, I do and I don't want her to struggle, but also, if she needs help like over once a week, I'm wondering if maybe it's time for her to consider that she actually cannot live alone (that feels mean to say, but also true. If you can't do basic life things yourself, it feels like you need more help than just sporadic friends coming over can give you)  ",No A-holes here,2024-10-05,"WIBTA for no longer doing “favors” for my disabled friend Ok so look -- I love my friend Mary (25F), who is physically disabled and uses a wheelchair.
