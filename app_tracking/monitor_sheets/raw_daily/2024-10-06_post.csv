0,1fxoz0l,AITA for telling my friend that I need space because I feel isolated due to our friendship?,"I (17F) have a friend Jessie (17F) who I used to be very close with before this happened. We’d known each other since the beginning of secondary school but only got really close about a year and a bit ago. Jessie has this bad habit of having one friend be her ‘person’, someone who’d she’d monopolise and spend every single minute she possibly could with. Before I was in this position I thought it was kinda strange but relatively okay to do, but oh boy do I disagree with my past self now. As soon as I was put into the position of Jessie’s ‘person’ I began to be distanced from all my other friends and only focus on my friendships with Jessie. I didn’t notice it for the first year of being her ‘person’ but as I’ve gotten through these past few months I realise that I’ve barely talked to anyone who wasn’t Jessie since the new school year started. Realising this I also realised that we couldn’t just be only friends with each other and needed to be able to have friends outside of each other, which I’m not sure she realised that I felt that she was preventing me from doing so. So, I decided to talk to her about it even though I knew that she probably wouldn’t respond well to the criticism and I was right. During the conversation I told her that I felt we were too co dependent on each other and that because of that we were isolating each other, trying to make it seem that we were both partially to blame and it wasn’t just on her. However, even though I put it as nicely and politely as I could and it seemed that she responded well at the time I haven’t been able to speak to her at all since that day. She’s ignored every attempt at communication I’ve tried and won’t even try to reach out herself.
So AITA? Should I have left it and just dealt with my feelings by myself?

1,1fxoslu,AITA for being angry that my ex-friend lied to others about me?,"I (20NB) became friends with this girl (19F) in our first year of college. Both of us joined the theater program at our university and we got pretty close. We would hang out in each others' dorms all the time, watching movies and talking, and our friend group would regularly see live music or theater shows together. Through all of this we would often hold hands or cuddle and she slept over at my dorm a few times. We often got asked if the two of us were dating, which we replied that we weren't, mostly because at the time I was talking to another person and I don't generally date women. While we were talking about housing for the next school year, I asked if she wanted to room together, and she agreed.

After the end of our first year in June, I went home for the summer and she stayed on campus. The relationship that I had been previously in didn't work out, although we stayed friends, and I started thinking jokingly to myself how weird of a coincidence it would be if her and I got together, since we were rooming together next year--it was like a bad fan fiction trope. 

I posted some lighthearted things about it on my TikTok and Twitter, without thinking that she would ever see it since we didn't interact that much on TikTok and I didn't think that she had a Twitter account. I also thought that if she did see what I had posted, she would recognize that I wasn't serious and that I didn't want to date her.

The day before she was supposed to move in she texted me saying that she wasn't comfortable rooming with me because of what I had posted and that she didn't want to have me around or talk to me anymore. I tried to explain to her that it wasn't serious, but she refused to listen and told me that she wanted space. I told her that I was sorry if I had hurt her in any way, and that I wasn't sure what I had done wrong, but she basically told me to ""F off"" and refused to speak to me since. 

Now that we are back in school, things have been tense. We have one class together, but we sit far away from each other and don't normally talk to each other during class. Despite this, I've caught her glaring at me every time I say something in response to our professor or another student. This behavior continued in rehearsals for our theater production, where she would scoff or roll her eyes every time I spoke. 

On top of that, I learned from one of our mutual friends that she has been telling a wildly edited version of what happened to other people in the theater department, including some of the professors and directors. Because of this, my mental health has plummeted and I dropped out of the fall show.

I've lost a substantial chunk of my friends because of the rumors that she's spread about me, including almost everyone in the theater department. When I try to talk to others about this, they agree that it's a bad situation but don't find fault with her for what she did.

My friend (29M) has been arguing with his girlfriend (26F) recently because her mother has moved back in with her and my friend can’t deal with it. So he is moving into a new place on Wednesday. Until then, he has nowhere to live and says he can’t book hotels because he doesn’t have any ID at the moment. The police apparently took his passport because of him and his girlfriend arguing. He says that he was arrested then let go on the same day, but apparently his girlfriend was the one who went too far. I still don’t know the truth.

4,1fxoik4,AITA? 25F upset with 25m bf for minimising my feelings? ,"NOTE:
My boyfriend has had a cold for about 2 weeks with a blocked nose (important). 

We are staying at hotel - granted not the fanciest, but a decent chain within the UK. 

The first room we are given is on the ground floor and is smelling badly of damp. 
As someone who is sensitive to smells, I know that I'm going to have a tough time sleeping and worry about the health aspect a little bit... 
 
I tell my bf, ""this room smells like damp, I'm going to ask to change"". 
His responds is ""do you really want to be that person?""

We then visit our friend on the first floor and the room smells completely free of damp and what we are used to with the hotel chain. We then invite the friend to our room, who comments on the damp smell too. 

I battle with the decision for some time, as I think that 'maybe I can endure it', but then realise I cannot and go to the front to ask for a change in room.

We are then given another room on the same ground floor, which smells less strongly than the other one but still has a damp smell to this. 

I decide to hold my tongue because I can tell my bf doesn't want me to make a scene, but make a comment that the damp smell is still there. But when another set of friends come and comment on it (verbatim ""it stinks in here""), and state that their room on the floor above doesn't have this smell, I know that I am not crazy and only then did my bf consider that I was in fact not being dramatic. 

My bf let's me know that he worries about asking to change for a third time, as we could be perceived negatively. 
I tell him it's unfair to make it seem like I'm asking for too much, when he can't smell and I am the one who has to put up with it. 

He then says he won't deal with me complaining about it any longer and asks to swap the room, but makes it sound like it's me making a big deal and breaking his neck about it to reception. 

Following the stay, I expressed to him that I was upset that he didn't believe me and only thought I wasn't being too much when our friends commented on it. 

I expressed that I felt like he minimised my emotion (we have had issues with him perceiving himself as being more logical than me because he is slower to respond to off handed comments than I am). 

We agree that next time we will check rooms so we don't go through the situation of jumping a 3rd time, but he doesn't understand how not believing me was hurtful? I described it as feeling as though my partner doesn't believe I'm logical until others agree?

We used to live in buildings that were adjacent to each other before we even became friends. I always knew of her but didn't become friends until we were appointed the same class in highschool. After we graduated, we ended up going to the same college in the main city area but in different departments. This led to us meeting less frequently but we still chatted a lot and even though we barely got time with handling the coursework and new friends, we would try our best to keep in touch.

We used to live in dorms but since we are seniors in college now, we can live in our own places. A few months back, Olivia told me that she'll start living in a rented apartment instead which was a bit far from the college campus. I offered to live with her as a roommate but she said she had already found one. Weirdly enough, she didn't even ask me to come over but I just believed she must be busy as she is preparing for an exam related to pursuing higher educations post college. We kept meeting less and less, but she would try to meet me at lunch breaks or would walk me back to my dorm before she left to go back to her apartment.

One day, I asked her jokingly if she didn't want to invite me to her new place. She kind of had a weird expression on her face before she awkwardly laughed and told me how her roommate was super private and hated having other people over. I didn't question further and let it be - until yesterday. It was Olivia's birthday and we have celebrated our birthdays with each other always. Naturally, I called her to meet up but when she didn't pick up, I called her mom to get her address so I could go and meet her.

I don't see why this is a big deal as the house is hers too and I could just be sitting in her room. She told me I was a jerk for trying to invade her privacy and asking her address without her consent. When I told her I just wanted to celebrate her birthday, she told me I ruined it already.

7,1fxo7cv,WIBTA if I were to tell my grandmother that my mom could get her kicked out of her housing? ,"
To start off, I’m 23F. Grandma is 83F and my mom is 46F. 

Some background. When I was growing up, my mom lived on my grandmother’s trust fund that her father passed down to her. 

Growing up, I knew the funds were going to run out, and that my mom had pretty severe mental health issues (she believed that when the funds ran out they’d magically replenish with millions and the whole world would worship her and reveal her as royalty), substance issues, etc. 

So, by the time I was 17, all funds were exhausted. We became homeless. I slept in the car with my mom. My mom started stripping and would spend the money on coke, weed and booze. I had been in and out of foster care, and entered again for the last and final time. 

In the mean time, my gma was as kicked out of the car by my mom, and was living in a public beach bathroom. She started going to work at a grocery store. She ended up staying with a coworker, and then ended up renting a one room shed from another coworker. My mom was still living in the car.  

My mom, convinces my gma to let her stay with her. Apparently my gma and her landlord were on the rocks already and my mom refused to follow house rules, yelling, and was smoking weed on property. 

They got kicked out and they were homeless again. My mom decides to sell the car, and they begin living in a hotel for about a week. Afterwards, my gma and mom are sleeping at a beach park. My mom abandons my grandmother, my grandmother reaches out to me.

My gma stays with us for a bit over a week but due to my living situation I can’t keep her for longer. I try to get her into a shelter or cheap room (she has SS) nothing works out in time, and she refused to be admitted to a shelter. 

So, my gma goes back on the street. My mom and her are homeless. Gma ends up going into heart failure, and is admitted to a hospital. She is assigned a social worker and SW connects her with housing resources. My mom does not have a social worker. 

So, fast forward, she is now living in an apartment that she pays for via section 8 voucher. 

I decide to visit my gma the other day. I have a bad relationship with my mom and she’s always with her so I haven’t seen her as much in person as I’d wish to.

I come in. My mom drilled 5 cat posts into the wall. She acts disgruntled with the neighbors, and they have 7 cats. The landlord only knows about one. My mom is also lighting up in the apartment, neighbors could smell it or even see her. My gma told me how this project of taking care of the cats is healing to my mom. 

I feel like my mom is jeopardizing this chance to be living in an actual home, but I don’t know if it’s my place to tell my gma this. I don’t want my gma to be kicked out of a place again because of her daughter. But then again, my mom cleans and cooks and she appreciates that.

So, my gma goes back on the street. My mom and her are homeless. Gma ends up going into heart failure, and is admitted to a hospital. She is assigned a social worker and SW connects her with housing resources. My mom does not have a social worker. 

So, fast forward, she is now living in an apartment that she pays for via section 8 voucher. 

I decide to visit my gma the other day. I have a bad relationship with my mom and she’s always with her so I haven’t seen her as much in person as I’d wish to.

I come in. My mom drilled 5 cat posts into the wall. She acts disgruntled with the neighbors, and they have 7 cats. The landlord only knows about one. My mom is also lighting up in the apartment, neighbors could smell it or even see her. My gma told me how this project of taking care of the cats is healing to my mom. 

I feel like my mom is jeopardizing this chance to be living in an actual home, but I don’t know if it’s my place to tell my gma this. I don’t want my gma to be kicked out of a place again because of her daughter. But then again, my mom cleans and cooks and she appreciates that. 

WIBTA if I tried to find a way to tell my grandmother that she needs to set boundaries with my mom because she’s putting her housing at risk? ",0.0,0.037233554,0,1
8,1fxo246,AITA for approaching an old friend to tell him I wasn’t involved in the cruel prank that was played on him years ago?,"When I (19F) was in 10th grade, I had a friend with a prosthetic leg. He would sometimes take it off for a few minutes, then put it back on. One time he was pranked by my back then friends.

Basically, they “stole” his prosthetic leg in a brief moment. He saw them doing it but couldn’t stop them in that moment. They returned it to him in like 3-5 minutes (that’s what they told me). I wasn’t there when they stole it, and I had no idea they did this. I just came to the room afterward and saw him without his prosthetic leg. I asked him what just happened, and he shouted at me, telling me to not play dumb, do I really think that’s funny, and that I “suck like the rest of them.”

This did not happen at school, but they both got suspended over this.

I was mad at them for what they did and told them that it was disgusting, but I didn’t entirely cut them off. I told everyone that knew about the prank who wasn’t involved in this prank, and I texted him too, but he blocked me from everywhere and wouldn’t listen to me either when I tried to approach him. We only talked about it once, and he straight up told me he doesn’t believe I wasn’t involved in it because I was still friends with the guys who pranked him.

Two weeks ago, I saw him in my dream out of nowhere, and yesterday I saw his profile on a dating app. I thought this was a sign. I created a new profile (with no pictures) and texted him, saying I’m someone he knew and I wanna make a call. He said alright, so we had a call. As soon as he heard my voice, he said he can’t believe this. I said please listen to me and explained to him that I really wasn’t a part of that prank and I’m really sorry for what happened. He hung up on me, then texted me saying he sees I didn’t change in the slightest and still not owning up to my mistakes. He told me this was so traumatic for him and I should have known better than just bringing it up like that, and me saying he doesn’t wanna talk with me until I actually grow as a person.

I didn’t text back to him. Now I feel so fucking bad for calling him in the first place. AITA?

9,1fxnvgk,AITA for calling out a girl who's been saying slurs?,"So, I (16F) go to an all-girls school, and we have this exchange student, Jenna (16F), who has been attending our school for the last two years. From the moment she arrived, she’s been the extra person in our group, and honestly, she's known for using slurs and saying some really inappropriate things. I, along with a few other girls, have confronted her about her behavior multiple times, and it's no secret that I really don't like how she acts.

Recently, we went on a field trip, and while we were hanging out with a group of boys, one of them asked me who Jenna was. Without thinking too much about it, I said, “She’s a girl who says slurs and is just extra.” I didn’t realize Jenna was standing right behind me until I heard her turn around and start calling me the R-word. I was taken aback because I thought we had resolved our issues.

Later that day, I felt compelled to apologize—not for what I said but for hurting her feelings because that was never my intention. Jenna, however, just kept cursing at me and calling me slurs in return. Eventually, we managed to talk it out and put it behind us.

The next day at school, one of the girls in our friend group, Beatrice, said, “Who likes pick-me’s? I really don’t like pick-me’s.” The rest of the group gathered around to check on Jenna, who was visibly upset.

Now I’m in a tough spot because half of my friends are on my side, understanding where I was coming from, while the other half seems to be siding with Jenna, despite knowing about her behaviour.

So, AITA for calling out Jenna and saying what I did, or am I in the wrong for hurting her feelings?

\*\*\* Hey everyone, I just want to say thank you for the comments. While scrolling through them, I realized there might be some confusion in my original post. When I said, ""I was taken aback because I thought we had resolved our issues,"" I meant that she should already know how I feel, as I've confronted her multiple times about her behaviour. She knows how I feel about her being racist and mean to others.

**Also: I don't really hang out with her, but she tends to stick with the few friends she has within the friend group, so we're still around each other sometimes.**

I also want to add that she attended an international school and has been exposed to various cultures, so she is fully aware of her actions. On top of that, she's been mean to other kids, including LGBTQ+ members, who have done nothing to her. She even publicly shames others on social media, which is unacceptable.

I also want to mention that I'm part of the student council, I get good grades, and my teachers love me. It's just not in my nature to act this way, which is why I immediately felt bad about my actions. I know what I said might not have been the best choice of words—it was the first thing that came to mind.

12,1fxmv8q,WIBTA if I insist that my partner's sister should move out instead of us,"So I've run into a bit of a conflict today and would like some outsiders perspective on this. This concerns me, my girlfriend, and her sister. My girlfriend and I have been together one year. 

This spring, my girlfriend's dad got married, and their new stepmom was moving states to live with him. She owns a house here. She decided to rent it to my gf and her sister instead of selling or dealing with unknown renters. I visited and stayed the night a few nights per week, usually coming over around 11:30pm or so due to my work schedule. My gf and I both work evening shifts. Typically it was just me and my gf there. My girlfriend's sister spent most of her time at her boyfriend's house. She also told my girlfriend that being there gave her anxiety, mostly stemming from my girlfriend's dogs. So that's why she was often gone. 

I was living in an apartment during this time. My gf and I have talked about a future together and living together. The end of my lease was coming up (today actually), so a little over two months ago I broached the topic of my next move with my girlfriend, whether I should look for another apartment or potentially move into the house. She talked to her sister and stepmom, both of whom gave the ok for me to move in. So just a week ago now, I hired movers, brought my stuff over, and rented a storage unit for the rest of my things not needed here. We also worked it out with gf's sister for us to cover a majority of rent, since we 1)have the master bedroom and 2)she was already not there often anyways. 

Now, a week after moving in, she has come to my girlfriend saying that she is super uncomfortable with me living there. We haven't had any issues, either prior to me moving in or after, always been friendly. My gf texted me this and saying that we should look for a place to move out together. 

I know they both haven't been the happiest living together anyways, so I responded saying I understood and we can look. But a large part of me feels like her sister should be the one to move out. There are a few reasons for this. She is the one who is suddenly uncomfortable. She's already not there most days anyways. And she wouldn't be able to financially cover the rent on her own, although my gf says that their dad would likely cover half if we were to move out, where my gf and I could easily pick up her portion between the two of us. 

I don't want to be the source of conflict here, but I feel kind of like a doormat just acquiescing and moving out. So, WIBTA if I insisted that my gf's sister be the one to look for a new place instead? 



Edit: insisting is too strong a word, definitely poor word choice on my part. My plan would be to talk to my gf one on one about her sister being the one to move out instead.

My parents worked multiple jobs just to cover rent and basic necessities, and there were times when we had to rely on assistance programs. I put myself through college by juggling part-time jobs— as a waitress, tutoring, and doing freelance gigs. It wasn’t easy, but I managed to graduate with a degree in marketing. Now I’m working in a job that I love, but I’m still living paycheck to paycheck.

About a year ago, I started dating Mike (44M). We met at a charity event where I was volunteering. He approached me to learn more about the cause. I was surprised when he asked for my number, considering our age difference and him being clearly wealthy, but I found him charming and easy to talk to.

Our relationship blossomed quickly. Mike is incredibly kind, funny, and genuinely interested in my life and struggles. He’s always supportive of my dreams, encouraging me in my career pursuits and offering valuable advice. I never expected to be with someone from such a different background, but he treats me as an equal, which has been refreshing.

However, as I got to know him better, I learned about his daughter Emily (20F). Their relationship is pretty rocky; he doesn’t have much of a connection with her. Their communication mainly revolves around the financial support he provides. He sends her a significant amount of money each month, which she seems to use to fund a lavish influencer lifestyle. She isn’t working or studying, which made me uncomfortable.

When I first brought up my concerns to Mike, he was defensive. He felt guilty about not being a more present father and justified his financial support as a way to show he cares. I understood where he was coming from, but I pointed out that sending money alone wasn’t building a real relationship or encouraging Emily to take responsibility for her life.

After several conversations, Mike agreed with me. I said he could still support her but only for legitimate needs—like tuition, books, or living expenses—if she enrolled in community college or at least got a part-time job. I genuinely thought this was a positive step for both of them. However, when Emily found out, she reacted badly, posting on social media about how Mike is a terrible father for abandoning her and not supporting her dreams.

Now Mike is feeling torn. He wants to be a good dad, but he also acknowledges that my perspective makes sense. I can see he’s struggling with guilt, and I worry that I may have overstepped by influencing him, especially since it’s causing tension in their relationship.",Asshole,2024-10-06,"AITA for convincing my boyfriend to cut off financial support for his daughter?

I knew my best friend would want to come with me, she loves the artist too. 
I texted her that I found this concert and I want to book us tickets but she was asleep. 
I set up 2 accounts just so I can maximize my chance of getting the tickets because I really wanted to go. 
Tickets go on sale. 
They’re all sold out in seconds. 
However I try to buy 1 ticket and not 2 and it goes through. 
I tell my friend I’m sorry I could only buy one and she says I’m selfish.

15,1fxmd4g,AITA for refusing to help my roommate clean our shared space because she never acknowledges my cleaning efforts?,"I (19F) live with my roommate (20F) in a two-bedroom apartment. We’ve been living together for about six months, and overall, we get along pretty well. But there’s one issue that’s been bothering me: cleaning.

I’m a pretty tidy person, and I like to keep our shared areas (like the kitchen, living room, and bathroom) clean. I’ll often clean up dishes, wipe down surfaces, take out the trash, etc. without being asked because I like things organized. My roommate, on the other hand, isn’t as tidy and doesn’t seem to care if things are messy. When she does clean (which is rare), she always makes a big deal about it, saying stuff like, “Look, I cleaned the living room today,” or “I took out the trash, you’re welcome.” I’ve never really said much because I figured maybe she just needed some validation.

The problem is, she never acknowledges when *I* clean. I could spend an hour scrubbing the kitchen, and she won’t say a word about it. She’ll just use the space without a thank you or any kind of recognition. Recently, it’s been bugging me more and more because I feel like I’m putting in way more effort to keep our apartment clean, and she’s taking it for granted.

A few days ago, she asked me if I could help her clean the living room because her friends were coming over. I straight-up told her no and said I didn’t want to help since she never seems to notice when I clean up after both of us. She got upset and accused me of being passive-aggressive and said I should’ve just told her if it bothered me that much.

Now, things are pretty tense between us, and she’s acting like I’m the bad guy for not helping out. I feel like I’ve been cleaning for both of us this whole time, and she’s only upset now because I said no for once.

16,1fxm6v2,AITA for refusing to make my dad a painting?,"I (19F) am in my second year of college and am currently overloading on courses, taking 6 classes a semester instead of the expected 5. Outside of school, I'm a competitive athlete and work part-time on the weekends in order to pay for expenses such as food, transportation, etc. I currently live at home and commute to campus primarily by train since it's a few towns over, and I don't have the means to rent since it's insanely expensive, and the gym where I train is more local.

One thing I used to do growing up was make my parents drawings for their birthdays, Christmas, mother and father's Day, their anniversary, and so on whenever a special occassion arose. My dad's birthday is in September. Near the end of August, he asked me if I was working on his painting, and I told him I didn't have the time at the moment. I had a competition I was training for in September and I was also preparing for the upcoming school year since I already knew I'd have more on my plate with the extra classes. He scoffed at this answer and left me be.

Here's the thing: I've come to understand that nothing I'll do will ever be enough for my dad, and never meet his contradicting standards. I've gotten sick of not only how he'll berate me for any small thing he can find, but also how poorly he treats my mother. When the time came to decide whether or not I'd make him a painting this year, I ultimately decided against it. To me, the decision came down to whether or not I'd be doing it as an obligation or if it'd be a labour of love, which I feel a handmade gift should be. In addition, I didn't want to rush and make something I wasn't proud of, and my dad would've also yelled at me saying that I didn't care about him telling me he knows I can do better.

His birthday came and my dad asked if I had made him something, and I told him my latter reasoning: it would've been rushed and something I wasn't proud of. He slowly nodded and didn't bring it up again. I was then thrown back into school and hadn't thought about it much until my mom brought it up to me a whole month after his birthday passed. She told me that when I'm not home, he complains almost daily how he didn't get a painting, and how I was ungrateful for everything he's done for me and that I couldn't even make him something as appreciation. My stomach dropped— I knew he'd be upset but didn't think it'd be for this long. Now I can't look at my dad now without thinking about it.

I'm starting to think I'm in the wrong here and that I should've tried to fit it in my schedule to paint him something, and that I should relent my initial reasoning since it's something that'd make him happy. I genuinely do appreciate the things he has done for me, but I can't bring myself to do it and haven't touched a paintbrush since August.

My dad and his wife think it's time for family therapy with them, my brother (9) and stepsister (7). But I don't think that's such a good idea. So I counter suggested that my dad goes with me to some family therapy sessions instead. My dad was like no, that's not a good idea and I was like ""this might be the best way to do therapy"". It's been weird since I said this. My dad's wife was pissed, kinda offended and also kinda hurt and my dad said I made him feel torn.

So background on why I'm in therapy, why they want family therapy and stuff. They got married 6 years ago. They met 7 years ago. My mom died after a complicated birth with my brother. Losing her was the worst. I never blamed my brother even though a lot of people expected me to. But he's my brother and mom loved him so much and she was so excited for me to be his big sister. I remember her saying how perfect our family was and how he'd complete it. But then she didn't get to see it happen. My dad couldn't really cope on his own and met his wife at this group for single parents and they started dating. Her daughter was newly born and her daughter's father was not involved.

My dad and his wife were hoping we'd all become this perfect little family. My dad's wife told me she was so excited to be a mom to three kids. My dad said he couldn't wait to see me as a big sister to two. He knew before they got married that I hadn't started to care about them. I think he thought it would change. But I never felt that way about my dad's wife or my stepsister. I don't hate them. I don't dislike them. But I don't love them or feel the whole perfect family thing. I'm civil and I try not to be obvious about my feelings with my stepsister, though I'm pretty obvious about not considering my dad's wife my mom. 

Over time it did get more obvious that I favor my brother and that I love him vs accept the fact my stepsister is in the household. My dad said it was in how I looked at them. He said I look emotionless at my stepsister but I light up with my brother. I think he might have realized too that I know stuff about my brother but not my stepsister. My dad and his wife sat me down 2 years ago and told me I needed therapy because it wasn't healthy. And now they think we need therapy all together to work on things as a family and to get all the cards on the table. But my feelings haven't changed. I still don't love the step members of the family. I still wouldn't say they're people I'll always want in my life.

This is why I suggested therapy with just dad. I wouldn't be okay being that honest to dad's wife and my stepsister's a kid so I don't want to be the reason she ends up with trauma. But my dad and his wife don't like what I suggested.

20,1fxkzez,AITA for Bringing My Daughter to a Child-Free Wedding?,"
Hi everyone. I’m a 19-year-old mom to my beautiful 2-year-old daughter, Amelia. Just a bit of backstory: last year, I was asked to be a bridesmaid in a family friend’s wedding. I was thrilled and immediately said yes, even though it was a child-free event. I had arranged for a babysitter, but about a week before the wedding, she informed me that she would no longer be in the city and couldn’t watch my daughter.

Given the short notice, I approached the bride and asked if I could bring Amelia to the wedding, as I didn’t have time to find another trusted babysitter. My daughter is overall a very easygoing baby—she’s comfortable with people and happy as long as she’s fed. The bride knew this since she’d watched my daughter on multiple occasions before, and she happily agreed, saying that having Amelia there would make the wedding photos even more special.

The wedding was going smoothly, though I noticed a few stares from the groom’s parents. Amelia stayed with my sisters for most of the day, but during the reception, I took her with me to congratulate the couple. As I approached with Amelia in my arms, the groom’s mother suddenly commented, “You shouldn’t have brought a baby to a child-free wedding, especially when she doesn’t fit the family.”

I was completely taken aback. For context, my daughter is mixed—I’m half white and half Hispanic, and her father is Black. I’ve been called “white-washed” because I’m not in contact with my Hispanic family, so I knew exactly what she meant by saying my daughter didn’t “fit the family.”

The bride looked shocked, and the groom immediately stood up and led his parents away. Taking this as my cue, I decided it was time to leave. I made the rounds to say goodbye to everyone and put Amelia in her stroller. As I was leaving, the bride came over to apologize for her in-laws’ behavior. I was upset, but I knew it wasn’t her fault, so I simply wished her luck and left.

Now, about a week after the wedding, I got tagged in a Facebook post—strange, because I don’t use Facebook. The post read: “I’m outraged that my grandchildren weren’t allowed at this event, but when a teen mother who couldn’t be responsible enough to leave her child with the father brings her baby, it’s perfectly fine.” The post was from the groom’s mother. To make things worse, she’s also been telling family members that I’m lying about what she said regarding my daughter’s appearance.

So now I’m wondering, am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-06,"AITA for Bringing My Daughter to a Child-Free Wedding?

21,1fxk63p,AITA for telling my friends to leave because of how they were chewing?,"I (22F) have misophonia. Please don't judge me for that as I understand it’s a “me” problem, and I never expect anyone else to stop what they’re doing that makes me uncomfortable when it’s not my home. Chewing is my biggest trigger, but when people are chewing loudly, I usually leave the room. The closest I’ve come to ""making it someone else’s problem"" is when someone who wasn’t the chewer asked why I left the room, and I calmly explained my misophonia. Two of my best friends (21F and 22M) — we’ll call them ""G"" and ""K"" — whom I love, chew with their mouths wide open and make a lot of noise while eating. For this reason, I try to avoid eating with them.

Things became interesting the other day when I mentioned how I’d been in the mood for baking brownies back at my apartment. They asked if I wanted to bake with them, and we could have fun. I agreed but mentioned that it might not be the best idea for us to eat together afterward. They said they understood and promised they would chew quietly and keep their mouths closed to have fun together. After asking multiple times to confirm they wouldn’t feel like they were walking on eggshells, we made plans.

When we sat down to eat the brownies, they both chewed with their mouths wide open and made horrible sounds. I assumed they’d forgotten what we talked about, so I politely asked, “Sorry guys, do you mind chewing quieter and closing your mouths please?” I felt like I deserved a break from noises that irritated me once I was back in my apartment. G said it wasn’t fair for me to expect them to chew differently.

Remember, I never ask this of someone outside my home. I was dumbfounded since I never ask this of them in any other scenario. I reminded them of the conversation where they promised to be mindful of their chewing. G said she didn’t think I’d actually hold them to it and that, as their friend, I ""should be willing to put up with it."" K nodded in agreement and said it’s not a big deal. I explained how badly this condition affects me and that I wanted peace and quiet in my own apartment after some fun time with them. K said something like “fun shouldn’t come at a sacrifice” (I blocked out the exact wording in shock, but it was something similar). I was fed up and asked them to leave. They sat there in shock and silence for a moment. I repeated that it was probably best if they both just left for the night. G rolled her eyes and said I was being ridiculous, then took another huge bite of brownie and chewed obnoxiously. At that point, I demanded that they leave, which they finally did.

I’ve talked to them since then, but it’s just been casual texts like “How are you/What’s up?” Things haven’t felt the same for the last few days. I’m wondering if I went too far and should’ve put up with it for the sake of friendship, but I genuinely cannot function while hearing certain noises. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-06,"AITA for telling my friends to leave because of how they were chewing? I (22F) have misophonia. Please don't judge me for that as I understand it’s a “me” problem, and I never expect anyone else to stop what they’re doing that makes me uncomfortable when it’s not my home. Chewing is my biggest trigger, but when people are chewing loudly, I usually leave the room. The closest I’ve come to ""making it someone else’s problem"" is when someone who wasn’t the chewer asked why I left the room, and I calmly explained my misophonia. Two of my best friends (21F and 22M) — we’ll call them ""G"" and ""K"" — whom I love, chew with their mouths wide open and make a lot of noise while eating. For this reason, I try to avoid eating with them.

Earlier today I went to get my lab test done, and I made an appointment for right when they open. I get there earlier and there was already a big line going around the hallway of people waiting doing walk-in. 


Since I had an appointment and the doors weren’t open yet I just stood by the front and walked in when they opened the doors. 


One guy in the line makes a remark saying, this guy is cutting in, which I don’t respond to but then I get inside and I see everyone is lined up in the appointment line. (There is 2 lines with a sign saying, appointment left and walk in on the right) 

So I go up to the front and ask if everyone is there for appointment, which everyone in that line said no, so I was like ok, I am gonna stand here and wait till they call me up. I also mentioned to the guy that this line was for appointments only. 


He then gets mad at me saying I should be at the back of the line, all the way down the hallway no matter if I have an appointment. I tell him no, there’s 2 lines for a reason and I get priority. He starts getting angry and raising his voice saying the same thing over and over until the people at reception tell him that appointment has priority and it doesn’t matter. 


I didn’t want to start anything but I get called up right away anyway and go get my lab work done no problem.

24,1fxjt2d,AITA for leaving my house and going to the gym? ,"I’m 18f and my mom 50s got into an argument. 

It started this morning when I woke up tired from the day before and asked if we could watch church online instead of going in person I had a long day yesterday and was exhausted. 

She said okay because normally we do this often but this is the first time I’ve asked to stay home. 

So I’m doing some mornings chores and cooking her breakfast and I’m cooking her chicken for the rest of the week.

But then she get frustrated because I’m not watching church I have it on the tv in the kitchen and she has it on in the living room. I tell her it’s on and I’m paying attention and she said that I need to be “sitting” and paying attention.

So then I try and tell her that I’m cooking and I can’t just leave it. But that just makes her more angry and she started crying and telling me that all she wants is “immediate obedience” and then we got into a argument which ended in her throwing her stuff and going to her room saying “I can’t do this anymore” repeatedly. 

This is where I may be in the wrong, I stayed sitting on my couch just crying to myself because honestly it’s draining to argue with her. So I stayed there crying for about 30 minutes waiting for her to come out of her room but she didn’t so I just wanted to leave that area.

So now I’m in the gyms parking lot on the phone with her because when she left her room and saw that I was gone she called me and then started to rip me a new one with “what were you thinking” and you “leaving the house was a screw up”

And now she’s complaining about my and mine sisters mental health and how it’s bad and how she feeling like it’s all her fault and how she feels like she could just leave and everybody would be happier and just complaining about me my sister and my dad in general about how we’re not happy and she’s has to fight us to do the things she asked us to do and how the house isn’t clean and my sisters room isn’t clean.

25,1fxjlvs,AITAH for calling my friend a furry?,"First Reddit post. 
Me[18 M] and my friend [16 F] text each other regularly. We’re usually always on good terms with a few fights in between which we always patched up, nothing major. Yesterday she was telling me about an anime she was watching (she watches a heck lot and talks about it so even without me watching it a lot, I know almost everything). 

She told me about this character who had a goat head(?). I searched on google and the character was normal except he had a goat skull head. She told me about how attractive he looks, said “hear me out” which I also understand. We had a past joke about calling people furries for all these part animal characters in anime so I said it too for her. 

Everything was okay and the usual “hear me outs” again. Later that day she told me about how she was watched that anime for hours and I again joked about the furry thing, that was it. She told me how she can’t even tell me about things she’s excited about anymore, and that I always make people feel bad when they’re excited to tell me about stuff. 

She brought up another example, she’s in highschool and had to make a class presentation, she was telling me about how she wrote the scripts for everyone in her group instead of them making their own scripts. I guess she was trying to say that she was able to do it all herself. 
She said I made her feel like she was being used by her group mates when all she wanted was to share this thing with me. 

And yes, I did tell her that she was being used by them. 
She said im always tense these days and maybe she should stop talking to me like before. In all of our previous fights it’s kinda been her calling me the insensitive jerk, the person trying to give solutions when they’re not needed, the person who thinks he knows it all, the one with a superiority complex. 

Everytime she resorted to stop texting me in order to see me make an apology, to say that “yes I accept im the biggest jerk”. I feel there are more mature ways to go on about this than that.

For his birthday I got him the new Mbappe Real Madrid Jersey . I knew he would love it and it was a pricy gift. 

My best friend is a sweet lovely soul who loves showing love in big ways. Every birthday for someone she loves is a huge party and she decorates and wraps gifts beautifully and is all around really into showing love in this way. 

I was telling her I was grabbing a gift bag for the gift and she says “ nooo you should like lay out roses and candles and like lead it to the bedroom and then be wearing the jersey and it be like sexy” 

I just laughed it off and said “no thanks “ 

She then was like “ why do you never show love? I couldn’t imagine being you guys.” 

And  I just said “ everything in our relationship isn’t a performance “ 

She got quite then hung up and we haven’t talked for two days.

Her husband didn't want to hang out with the other male spouses (it was a women-only party) and declined our offer to join us at the baby shower and made his wife leave earlier than she wanted to, which is a recurring issue and, I believe, the crux of their problems.

Once the couch was moved, my brother asked if I could give him and his girlfriend a ride to their friend’s place for lunch in a while. I agreed. Before we left, I made myself lunch, and sat down to eat. He asked, ""When can we leave?"" and I told him, ""Give me 15 minutes.""

After 15 minutes, I was still finishing my food, and my brother started getting impatient, saying, ""Come on, let’s go,"" and complaining about how slow I was. I ended up taking about 20 minutes, 5 minutes longer than I’d said. As I got ready to leave, he kept complaining, arguing, and getting annoyed. I told him, ""Sorry for being 5 minutes late, but can’t you appreciate that I picked you up and am driving you?"" He snapped back, ""Well I'm sure you wouldn't care if I promised to drive you to the airport and was 5 minutes late right??""

He kept arguing, complaining, and whining. Honestly, this was just the latest in a long pattern where I feel like he takes me for granted, always criticizing what I do. So I snapped and said, ""You know what, drive yourself, fuck off,"" and tossed the car keys in his direction before heading inside. I admit, it might have been an overreaction, but this has been building up for a while. For context, he can drive himself; he just didn’t want to have to come back later to drop off the car and get home, which would take about 15-20 minutes.

30,1fxf7q2,AITA for telling my mom her husband isn't my dad and his family didn't replace mine just because my dad died?,"I (17M) have a pretty blended family. Mom had me with my dad. They broke up when I was a baby. My mom had my half sister Macey (15F) with a guy named Aaron. They weren't really together from what I know but they shared custody of Macey her whole life just like my parents shared custody of me before dad died when I was 5. When I was 4 my mom started dating her first husband (husband #1) and had my three other half siblings Daniel (10M), Lila (9F) and Kenna (7F). My mom and her first husband got divorced and two years ago she remarried. Her husband (husband #2) has three kids with his ex, Holden (13M), Lacey (11F) and Kyrie (9F).

My half siblings go to their dads every other week. My stepsiblings go to their mom every other week. I'm the only kid who hasn't got my dad to go to. Because of this, my mom expected me and her husband to be super close and that I'd accept him as my new dad. Even after I didn't accept husband #1 as my dad she believed husband #2 would be different. Not to me. Dad is still my only dad and I don't see husbands #1 or #2 as my parent.

I have a close relationship with my extended family on dad's side. I have grandparents who live 10 minutes from me. I have three aunts who live within 30 minutes of me. Two uncles who live less than an hour away. 24 cousins who live within those distances of me lol. I have cousins of my dad who are close to us as well. There are times when my half siblings are with their dads that I'll ask to be with someone in dad's family. Mom doesn't like that I do it but she does let me sometimes.

But she really tries to push me to spend time with her husband or his family when my half siblings are gone or if I'm the only kid in the house.

Two weeks ago my half siblings were all gone to their dads houses. My stepsiblings wanted to spend time with husband #2's family. Which makes sense since it's their family too. I asked mom to let me spend the day with my grandpa since he was doing something cool. Mom looked surprised and told me there was a whole party going on at her ILs and I should be there with my family. I told her I wanted to be which is why I was asking to be with grandpa. Mom told me I was being intentionally ignorant and that I knew she was talking about her ILs. We got into a fight and she said I never willingly spend time with her husband or his family and I never prioritize  my family. I told her she never expects my half siblings to and I shouldn't be treated differently because my dad died. I said her husband didn't become my dad and his family didn't become my family just because my dad died. I told her they don't mean more to me than they do to my half siblings. Mom told me it's different. She said I shouldn't feel this way. I told her if it was up to me I'd never spend time with them. I'd spend time with my real family.

31,1fxf4yz,AITA for refusing to pay for my daughters university because of the degree she wants to do? ,"So I (55M) and my wife (53F) have 3 children (24M, 22F, 17F). My eldest child already has a job while the middle is in university and the youngest in her final year of high school.

 Because my daughter will be going to university soon we had a sit down about what she was going to do. Up until this point I left my wife to discuss this with my daughter because she's better with these things and closer with my daughter. Anyway, the issue came when my daughter said that she was intending to do a degree in fine arts and design. I was surprised but I let her talk her piece. She told me about her love for art and animation and she would love to turn her passion into a career. After she said everything she wanted to say I asked her to elaborate on the finer details and I could see that she wasn't thinking about what she would do after university. I told her that this is a terrible idea and she should rethink what she wants to do, and left the table assuming my wife would talk her into something more reasonable. 

Fast forward a month, and we are back having the conversation again. This time she was more certain than ever about doing her degree in fine arts. I was a bit frustrated because I was expecting my wife to talk her out of it, but my wife was supporting her and trying to convince me about the pros to it. I could see that I was fighting a losing battle, so I flat out told them that I would not pay for university if she would just waste my money. At this, both got very mad pointing out how I had paid for my previous children with out question (my son did mechanical engineering and my daughter does accounting). I point out that I never had to worry about them finding a job and that we are not in a first world country like the people in Europe or North America. There is no market for artists where we live and I the unemployment rate is already ridiculously high. I told her that I don't care what she does as long as it will lead to employment and left.

32,1fxeq0a,AITA for acting like a 'brat' on my birthday ?,"Birthday to shreds, Let's fucking go
I (19) for once in my fucking life decided to not help for my birthday party preparations the same morning. My mom said a few days ago while I was helping out that I never ever helped them prepare in all the birthdays and I decided to actually show her what happens when I don't help. Usually, It's just me, my dad and my mom doing all the preps.

I was helping taking the multiples last minute decorations out of the car when she came to me and told me to woke up early today and to be useful for once. I said I was always doing so, that I was always the one preparing along for my brother and mine's birthdays, to serve everyone, help taking out the trashes and the decorations, doing the mountain of dishes and that maybe since It's my time of the year, she could ask my little brother to help instead. She rolled her eyes and told me it was the least I could do and to not bring sweet baby brother into this. He's 17, He's not a BABY-

...So I didn't got up early like always, I took my sweet sweet time to shower, wash my hair- and my mom hit me with the 'I don't want to talk to you right now, you know what you did'  - No goodmorning or happy birthday ... 
She then proceed to get back up around lunch, before guests got here, didn't apologize, basicly went 'whatever, but, you know why I'm angry right ?' - and then critisized my lack of organisation, mentionning how my little cousins will be disgusted of my room (when she fucking knows I'd rather do a backflip booty naked to the empty pool then let one of thoses annoying little shits enter my realm introvercy)

I knew they'd need help, so I went downstairs, feeling too guilty and that maybe I was overeacting. Yeah, turns out it was just my parents doing everything, my brother wasn't awake either. So I cracked and said to my parents again he was a pimpery spoiled little BITCH that had too many privileges and it wasn't fair that I had to help for my birthday while he got staff, pointing out he was still in bed on my birthday while they yelled at me for waking up at 9:30

And thinking back, now I'm starting to feel a bit.. Bad about it all. Am I the asshole for snapping at her a few days ago and deciding to not help from the start as usual ? Should I have helped from the begining and not complain ? Should I have kept the brother out of the conversation ??
I ended up playing it off and giving the cold shoulder to my mom, and my brother thinks I'm being the spoiled brat and that it doesn't matter It's my big day.

33,1fxeaqh,WIBTAH if I snitched my flatmate,"so, here's the story: I (23F) am living abroad for a month a half because of work - my job requires training in another country, and they provide us with apartments to stay while we're here. Sometimes, we have flatmates due many employees being in the country at once.

According to the company's guide, we're strictly prohibited of having any guests in the flats, at ALL - but that's a rule I don't care much about, altho I never had anyone over, as I literally don't know anyone in this country.

Here's the thing: my flatmate (also 23F) had brought one of her friends here before and told me about it, and it was all chill. HOWEVER, last friday I went out for drinks with some coworkers and later came home; as I left the shower, she came into the flat with a looot of pro without even letting me know beforehand they'd be here, and that really pissed me off as I was drunk and this is also my space, I felt like I should at least be informed if they were coming as we're literally not allowed to.

Snitching her would mean she'd probably be fired tho, as it says in the contract that breaking these could result in that, but as much as she pissed me off, I also wonder if I'm not just being petty. My close friends say I should snitch since she has no respect of space.

WIBTAH if I did? 

ps: sorry if there's any typos, english isn't my first language 

edit due typos

edit 1: I did talk to her but it was not... great. She was kinda implying I was overreacting and that I was being to uptight. However, I'll probably drop the subject and not snitch unless she does it againbecause I feel like that's just gonna cause me unnecessary stress at work, and since I'm only here temporarily because I work for another office it'd just be a waste of stress.

34,1fxe4h4,AITA for playing a game without my friend?,"Some days ago a friend told me about a Roguelike game called Ravenwatch that could be played in coop. He had been looking for a game for us to play together since he got bored of other coop games we played before. 

I said ""Sure"" I bought it and we have had a couple of gaming sessions where we have gotten to the third boss but never killed it. During that day I said I woluld try some characters on my own tonget a grasp of them for next time. He didnt say anything, maybe he didnt hear me, no problem.

A couple of days later I tried a run on my own and got really lucky with the upgrades I was able to kill the 3rd boss easy. The run finished as it seemed to be the last boss.

I messaged him to ""celebrate"" I was able to kill the boss and that it seemingly was the last boss of the game. 

He got very mad saying that this game was supposed for us to play together and then got even madder saying I spoiled the final boss.

I was surprised by the reacting since as I said before we had already fought the boss so it wasnt new and even more about playing on my own.

I will say that I didnt answer the best way amd said something like ""you are overreacting"", which I think its true but was not the way to solve anything.

I had said I was going to play and he didnt say anything so first of all I didnt think it was a problem and from my point of view we didnt really care about the lore or story the roguelike has behind, we were just looking for something ti play. The game is a roguelike doesnt have such a deep story.

He said that how serious the game was didnt matter that I spoiled the surprise that that was the last boss.

I admit I did. I feel bad that I spoiled something for him. But I really think he got too mad about such a small detail and made a big deal out of it.

If I had spoiled a final cutscene, a second phase, the boss itself or something like that I could understand. I do believe some people are too sensitive with spoilers. But I dont know. Maybe I am the asshole?

35,1fxdsng,AITA for not telling my ex immediately about my daughter's first period,"Sorry about the long post. TL;DR at the bottom.  

EDIT: 

I want to make some things clear:

- yes, I'll admit it was not a good move to pressure my daughter into telling him. I'll talk to her about that and apologise. 
- there is no court order. We are not US residents and custody doesn't work like that here. We made a parenting plan and the idea is that you keep to that in good faith. Obviously, my ex is not doing that. I can't take him to court for that, because A) they'd likely send me back to a mediator, B) I can't afford a lawyer (neither can he) and C) taking him to court is a hostile act in itself. 

Background:

My ex (m45) and I (f43) have a daughter (f10). We haven't been separated for very long: we decided to get a divorce at the end of February and the divorce came through in June. 

Coparenting has been... difficult. For a long time he refused to even see me, let alone talk to me in person. At his request, we only communicated through a parenting app, until he decided he no longer wanted that. 

He's been trying to change every little thing we agreed on in the parenting plan. If I don't immediately respond to his messages, I'm manipulative. If I don't give in, he'll accuse me of being controlling and start making one sided decisions, imposing his will. There's a reason we're divorced. 

Officially, the agreement is that she is at my house at 10 am on Saturdays (every other week). He previously said he hates to wake her up so early (like 8.30-9.00, he lives close) and wanted to change that. I gave a grace period and said that anytime before 11 am is fine.

Yesterday he again wanted to change the time she gets to my house on a Saturday. I politely explained my reasons for not wanting that. He said I was trying to control him etc.  I did not respond to that. 

On to the situation:

Then, just after she came to my house, my daughter got her first period. We'd been expecting it for a while, so it was all very laid back. She put on some period underwear and that was that. 

I asked her whether she wanted to tell her dad. She didn't just yet. I asked her whether she wanted me to do it. Not just yet. It's her body, her news, her decision, but I did tell her he needed to know eventually. 

I asked a couple more times throughout the day and she eventually said I could mail him, but with the whole ordeal of that day I really didn't feel up to it. I got a physical reaction just at the thought of having to contact him. Later, I saw that I had another nasty email and I just didn't want to deal with that at that time, so I decided not to email him. 

This morning,  I again told my daughter to tell her dad about the period. She texted him and told him she got it yesterday. 

Of course, I get an angry email asking why he wasn't told immediately. I replied that she didn't want to tell him yesterday and that she told him today because I urged her to.

I could have informed him yesterday though. AITA? 

TL;DR: I could have told my ex that my daughter had her first period yesterday, but instead I waited and had my daughter tell him today.

I can't take him to court for that, because A) they'd likely send me back to a mediator, B) I can't afford a lawyer (neither can he) and C) taking him to court is a hostile act in itself. 

Background:

My ex (m45) and I (f43) have a daughter (f10). We haven't been separated for very long: we decided to get a divorce at the end of February and the divorce came through in June. 

Coparenting has been... difficult. For a long time he refused to even see me, let alone talk to me in person. At his request, we only communicated through a parenting app, until he decided he no longer wanted that. 

He's been trying to change every little thing we agreed on in the parenting plan. If I don't immediately respond to his messages, I'm manipulative. If I don't give in, he'll accuse me of being controlling and start making one sided decisions, imposing his will. There's a reason we're divorced. 

Officially, the agreement is that she is at my house at 10 am on Saturdays (every other week). He previously said he hates to wake her up so early (like 8.30-9.00, he lives close) and wanted to change that. I gave a grace period and said that anytime before 11 am is fine.

Yesterday he again wanted to change the time she gets to my house on a Saturday. I politely explained my reasons for not wanting that. He said I was trying to control him etc.  I did not respond to that. 

On to the situation:

Then, just after she came to my house, my daughter got her first period. We'd been expecting it for a while, so it was all very laid back. She put on some period underwear and that was that. 

I asked her whether she wanted to tell her dad. She didn't just yet. I asked her whether she wanted me to do it. Not just yet. It's her body, her news, her decision, but I did tell her he needed to know eventually. 

I asked a couple more times throughout the day and she eventually said I could mail him, but with the whole ordeal of that day I really didn't feel up to it. I got a physical reaction just at the thought of having to contact him. Later, I saw that I had another nasty email and I just didn't want to deal with that at that time, so I decided not to email him. 

This morning,  I again told my daughter to tell her dad about the period. She texted him and told him she got it yesterday. 

Of course, I get an angry email asking why he wasn't told immediately. I replied that she didn't want to tell him yesterday and that she told him today because I urged her to.

I could have informed him yesterday though. AITA? 

TL;DR: I could have told my ex that my daughter had her first period yesterday, but instead I waited and had my daughter tell him today.

36,1fxdqnj,AITA for not writing about my stepdad when doing an assignment on the most important male figure in my life?,"I (16f) need to ask this because it has turned into this big thing. So for school we were asked to do an assignment on the most important male figure in our lives. This male figure could be dead or alive, but they had to be in our life at some point in our lives. Couldn't be a political figure we never met or a celebrity we never met. I chose my dad to talk about. And I still consider him the most important male figure in my life with my brother (24m) in second place. I also have a sister (20) and she isn't close to him either because she was 16 when they got married.

My stepdad, who has been dating my mom since I was 10 and married to her since I was 12, was hurt when he realized I didn't talk about him. He has tried really hard to be a second father to me. I know he doesn't want to replace my dad. He just wants to have a kid. He can't have any of his own since he had cancer at 17 and it left him sterile. But he always wanted kids and due to medical stuff he isn't eligible to adopt in the normal way. Actually, two years after he and mom got married he asked me if I'd like him to adopt me. I said no. And I could tell that really hurt him. But he still tries.

So yeah, I didn't do the assignment on him and it really hurt his feelings. We don't have the relationship he wants because I don't want a second dad and so I treat him like my mom's husband, but not like my parent/second dad. What I mean by that is... I speak respectfully and I do chores when he asks and that kinda stuff. But I never hugged him before. I don't call him dad. I don't say my parents when I mention him and mom together. When stuff about college gets mentioned at school I go to my mom, especially if money is being mentioned. Or if I want money for going out I ask my mom and not my stepdad. Oh, and I don't get him Father's Day cards or gifts. Stores local to us don't really have any for step's anyway.

Sorry, rambling a little. But after the assignment got some attention and it was put on display at school (because I didn't write mine in an essay but did it a little differently) and my mom and stepdad saw it, they spoke to me about it and my stepdad mentioned how much it hurts him when I don't consider him that important and he told me he felt like I could have done two and talked about him and my dad if I really wanted to mention dad. But that he felt like me doing it in a non-essay format and knowing that stuff would be displayed at school, he felt it was a hurtful thing for me to do.

This is a loving relationship but we’ve been fighting a bit more lately. Recently I surprised her with tickets to an artist we both like. I wanted us to have a night out, and though we’re not die-hard fans, we enjoy their music. She seemed excited when I told her.

I agreed, but the next day she backed out, saying it wasn’t in her budget to travel to another city for a night (2 hour drive away) and she didn’t care much about seeing the artist anyway.

39,1fxdf5n,AITA for refusing a wedding even when my mom offered to pay?,"My wife (25f) and I (27m) eloped about a month ago after being engaged for 7 months. We had talked a lot about what we wanted and while neither hated the idea of a wedding, we had our own reasons for preferring to avoid it. For my wife, she has a lot of interfamily conflict on her side and didn't want the pain of choosing who to invite in order to minimize any potential bad behavior and issues for us. For me, it was also family related but more the expectations. My mom remarried when I was 19 more than 15 years after my dad died, and she became a stepmom of several very young kids (all under 8 at the time). While I get along okay with the steps, I don't have a close relationship with them. But I knew they would want to be included in the wedding in some way and I knew my mom would want them to be treated like my siblings. I knew her husband was almost definitely going to expect that they would be treated as if they were my blood siblings I was raised with. I knew I didn't want to do this, especially in terms of groomsmen/women and so eloping felt like the best way to avoid conflict from that. After we got back I realized how right I was because 3 of the kids had expected to be bridesmaids and groomsmen and had looked at outfits or ""practiced"" even though I never asked or even mentioned this.

My mom was upset when we announced we had gotten married. She asked about a wedding and I told her we felt it was better for us to elope. I said it saved us a lot of money and time. She told me she always wanted to see me get married. Then she offered to pay for us to have a real wedding. I told her it was a kind offer but not needed. She told me it would mean so much to everyone and the kids could be in the wedding like they wanted, she could see me get married and we'd all be together as a family to celebrate and it's what she/they wanted the most. She told me her husband was even willing to pitch in.

Again, I said no thank you and my mom told me I should at least consider it and ask my wife. She told me we denied ourselves a wedding when we got married but there's no reason to when all expenses would be paid. Her husband suggested I do it for the kids who were really hurt when I got married and didn't include them in it at all even though they had really wanted to be involved.

When I asked my coworker if he’d be down to hang out, he said it was a great idea, and that his girlfriend would also be there.

After we knocked on my coworker's door, he just stared at my girlfriend in shock, not saying anything. He eventually invited us in, but he acted *really* weird, rushing to the living room and closing his laptop. My girlfriend tried to be friendly, but he just grunted and didn't even look at her. When I asked where his girlfriend was, he said that she couldn’t make it. Then, he suddenly said that he actually needed to pick her up, and that we should probably leave. I asked if we should come back later, and he said “Not a good idea.”

The whole thing was just bizarre, and my girlfriend thought so, too. We decided to get lunch, and while we were waiting for our food, she looked up my coworker online. After a few minutes of digging, she started saying “Oh, god… oh god.” To make a long story short, it turns out he’s in a “relationship” with an AI.

It honestly made me look at my coworker in a completely different way. He's told me an insane amount of backstory about this “girl”, including things like her parents being conservative and controlling, her having an inheritance that she's afraid of losing, even stuff about a creepy ex.

He must have known, though, because I got an ENORMOUS message about how he thought we were on the same level, how he thought I was “better” than that, and on and on. He ended it by saying “Enjoy your human, kid.”

I’m not at all familiar with AI “dating”, so I have no idea how to respond. We work closely together, and I’m positive that Monday is going to be awkward as hell. Maybe there’s some etiquette about not bringing real girlfriends to meet AIs, but like I said, I have no idea.

42,1fxc6n7,WIBTA if I changed my last name in spite of my spouse's choice?,"Due to some events that aren't relevant to the post, my spouse became a black sheep of their family, with the majority of it's members cutting or reducing contact with them. I feel betrayed and angry thinking about the blow this was to them - a person who really appreciates family values and cultuvating those connections. I think that moving on and forgetting about their family's existence would be the best course of action in this situation. My spouse however seems to believe that their resentment is temporary and eventually everything is going to return to the previous state, even though it has been more than half a year, and there's no sign of anything changing in the near future.

It worries me because it seems like an unhealthy way of coping to me, and I'm worried that holding on to hope is only going to hurt them. I tried to convince them to change our last name in order to at least make a small step towards distancing and building a separate future. I told them that it doesn't have to mean that there can be no forgiveness on our part if the family decided to ask for it, but it would help reinforce the idea that we can make it on our own and be a complete family together without being reminded of those hurtful connections. Me bringing this up only makes them feel sad though. They say they want to be patient and they can't at all accept the idea of letting it go. Would me taking the first step be a good way to support them, or would not taking things at their own pace only make them feel more hurt and estranged?

Due to some events that aren't relevant to the post, my spouse became a black sheep of their family, with the majority of it's members cutting or reducing contact with them. I feel betrayed and angry thinking about the blow this was to them - a person who really appreciates family values and cultuvating those connections. I think that moving on and forgetting about their family's existence would be the best course of action in this situation. My spouse however seems to believe that their resentment is temporary and eventually everything is going to return to the previous state, even though it has been more than half a year, and there's no sign of anything changing in the near future.

It worries me because it seems like an unhealthy way of coping to me, and I'm worried that holding on to hope is only going to hurt them. I tried to convince them to change our last name in order to at least make a small step towards distancing and building a separate future. I told them that it doesn't have to mean that there can be no forgiveness on our part if the family decided to ask for it, but it would help reinforce the idea that we can make it on our own and be a complete family together without being reminded of those hurtful connections. Me bringing this up only makes them feel sad though. They say they want to be patient and they can't at all accept the idea of letting it go. Would me taking the first step be a good way to support them, or would not taking things at their own pace only make them feel more hurt and estranged?

43,1fxc69t,AITA: I went out with friends to celebrate a birthday and stayed out late.,"Am I the asshole?

For context, In middle school, high-school, and beginning of college I didn’t go out. Sure for a bit of high-school Covid was going on but still I never found the want or need to go out until I met my current group of friends. We usually just make small gatherings at my house since they all live in apartments and we can get pretty loud. Yesterday 10/5/24 my friends younger sibling who is part of the group and my friend turned 18, and the rest of us are 21 ( we are all girls btw). We decided we would go bowling around 4 and watch Sam and Colby’s new movie in the night around 10:30 pm just to get spooked out yk. I’m Hispanic and in our culture if you live with parent you gotta ask if you can go out, so I did. Told him exactly where I would be and what time I would be leaving and when the movie started. I also told my I would be going bowling but forgot to mention the movie. Both parents live in the same home and are married btw so it’s not like I was hiding it, but I did forget to say it as I was in a rush to buy something she has asked of me. During the movies which started at 10:30 how I had told my dad, I silenced my phone and put it in my purse cause I wanted to enjoy the movie. My mom proceeds to call me 8 times and message me where tf I was. Around the middle of the movie I checked my phone and saw the calls. I answered back that I was watching a movie and that I had let my dad know. She then tells me “solo tienes un padre” (translation: so you only have one parent) I had told her where I would be, the bowling place and the movie theatre are in the same area. It’s maybe like at 7 minute walk from the bowling area to the theatre. I checked the message of what I sent and I realized I didn’t tell her about the movies, but it was not like I was trying to hide the fact I was watching a movie, my dad knew and I was with a bunch of girls. So I said I would be coming back home once the movie ended. The movies ends and I drop off 2 friends at their house which is 0.6 miles away or a 5 minute drive and I get a call from my mom.

44,1fxbzzm,AITA for Spending My Own Money on a New Phone After My Sister Got a Better One at a Younger Age?,"I (17F) have been using the same phone for four years. It has very little storage left (only about 600MB), and a large chunk of it is taken up by system files. I love taking photos and videos because they’re really important to me, but my phone’s camera quality has gotten pretty bad, and I’m constantly out of space. I can’t bring myself to delete old pictures or videos because they have so much sentimental value, so I’m in a tough spot.

Meanwhile, my younger sister *Mia* got a much better phone than mine when she was just 10 years old. I didn’t get my first phone until I was 13, and it wasn’t nearly as nice as hers. It feels unfair, but I know that might just be me comparing things that don’t really matter. Still, I’ve been feeling frustrated seeing how easy it was for her to get a better phone at such a young age, while I’ve had to wait for so long to upgrade mine.

I’ve been working part-time and earning about $15 a day. I’ve saved up enough to buy myself a second-hand iPhone 11, which would give me the extra storage and better camera I need. I decided not to ask my   
parents for help because they both work long hours so I’d rather handle this on my own.

When I mentioned to my parents that I wanted a new phone they told me to wait for my mom to replace hers so I can have it but she's said she will replace it multiple times in the past 2 years so I doubt it's happening any time soon.

Some people have told me I should just be grateful for the phone I have, and others have said I shouldn’t spend my own money when I could wait for my parents to get me a new one. I’ve already waited years for things like a new bike (which I was promised but never got), and I feel like I’d be waiting forever for an upgrade.

45,1fxbzyo,AITAH for kicking out my adult son in his times of need?,"Note: this is a throwaway account so that I can’t be identified as he uses Reddit too.

So, my (42M) adult son( 21M) (let’s call him Owen) has been living in my house for all his life (obviously). My wife, his mother, died in a horrific car crash four years ago when Owen was 17. Since then, we have both been grieving but he was become lazier and lazier. After he finished secondary school he failed to get into the college he wanted, meaning he had to receive a place at one he wasn’t familiar with the area as it was further away from us. Since he finished college, he’s been living at my house rent-free and without a care in the world. Every time I suggest to him he find a job, he tells me “I'll look later!”, when infact ‘later’ never comes. I supply him with all the food he needs, all his basic necessities for absolutely no cost, and it’s starting to become difficult financially especially after his mother’s death. Whenever Owen eats something in a wrapper (e.g. chocolate bar, cupcake, etc), he doesn’t bother to get up and go to a bin, but chucks wrappers across the living room in random directions hoping it might land in a bin. This ensures our house is a TOTAL MESS all day, leaving me to clean it after I get home from work, when I am already exhausted. 

A month or two ago I told him he had a month to pack his things and get out of my house or find a job. He has done neither. I told him two weeks ago, after the month period expired, that he needs to leave or I would be calling the police as it is a domestic issue. He told me I was being unreasonable and stupid, but the threat of the police was enough to get him to leave. 

As I said, it’s been two weeks since I kicked him out and he’s been texting me telling me he can’t find a place and he’s been couch-surfing and I suggested he move in with his grandparents (which he did after I suggested it). Owen is now residing at my parent’s house, where he continues to send me texts saying I’m an arse, that I’m a horrible parent, and he even had the nerve to send me a text that told me to “let him back in because it’s what mum would’ve wanted”. I was shocked at this message as he knows I am still grieving his mother’s death (as is he) and I am not doing particularly well in that department right now. I blocked his number and cut contact with him, which now I think might be an overreaction as my parents are telling me I’m being a bad father and an awful parent. AITAH?

EDIT: To clarify: any type of mental health support in the UK is dogshit. I tried grief counselling for both myself and “Owen” but we all know how it goes down here.

48,1fxbhe0,AITA for not telling someone that my classmate had a kitten in his bag?,"I literally lost two of my best friends over this.
On Friday, one of my classmates, for some godforsaken reason, decided it would be okay for him to bring a small kitten in his tote bag. Obviously, this is dangerous for multiple reasons. The cat could suffocate, we live in Florida and it's hot, the kitten could become stressed, people have allergies, etc.

So, I naturally, I went off on this kid. My best friend, let's call him L, was with me. 
L thinks I was totally in the wrong for calling attention to the situation but I really wasn't thinking in the moment, I love animals and I was pissed. A few minutes later, while walking to lunch, a trustworthy friend told me they were taking the kitten to a teacher's classroom and so I thought, ""Okay, good, problem solved, no reason to tell admin.""
I had some doubt, but figured I'd look crazy trying to tell an administrator at lunch where there are literally like 200 hundred kids that somebody has a cat in their bag. I just considered the situation squared away.
Well, come to find out, he didn't take the kitten to the teacher he said he would. He continued showing it off and passing it around to his friends. L was who eventually told the administrator and got it taken care of. The cat is ok, that is not the point of this story.

L says that because I didn't tell anyone, the cat could've died. I said that I thought it was taken care of, this didn't shake him.
Later on that day, L and our other best friend both texted me saying they don't want to be my friend anymore because I ""complain too much while never taking their solutions"", am ""cowardly"", and ""cross boundaries."" Some of this is related to past incidents, but the cat thing is really what ended it.

I now have to continue to work with L on our school's haunted house and it annoys me because I know what kind of person he is, and I know he's probably gonna try to paint me as an animal hating psychopath to our friends. This was honestly a long time coming since him and the other best friend have often times treated me poorly, but it doesn't make me any less pissed off. But I don't know, am I the asshole?

TLDR; Stupid kid brought a cat to school, I thought the situation was taken care of so I didn't tell anybody, situation was not taken care of, cat is fine, best friend got mad and insisted I put the cat's life in danger, two people have disowned me for being a coward.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-06,"AITA for not telling someone that my classmate had a kitten in his bag?

50,1fxamrt,AITA for checking to see if my ex lied about not being able to meet me after the breakup?,"Hi I recently have gone through a breakup and would like to get opinions on this. I do admit its not some crazy intense story like some others that are posted on this AITA community.

I (19F) and my ex (18M) met at work and didn't interact often due to the different areas we work at. At the start of this year we had our first proper conversation since I started working at this job. I went up to him and we got along pretty well. At the start of July I noticed he started liking my stories on insta and things between us progressed to a talking stage. We started dating at the end of August but because we go to different universities and he quit the job, we never got to see each other until mid September.
I admit things progressed very fast between us but I did know what I was getting into and made sure that he was sure with what he wanted.

Out of the blue, on National Boyfriends Day, he breaks up with me. He told me that his parents were disappointed with his performance at university and that made him realise his main priority is school. I found it such a jerk move because we both established that we have future plans we need to focus on and that it's understandable if we are busy. Even though we had good communication clearly he didn't communicate his priorities enough before progressing this relationship further.

Anyways, the morning of national boyfriends day, he tells me he cant meet me before his training session because his parents were dropping him off which I understood BUT that same day I get the breakup text in the afternoon. I asked if he could meet me before because its just awful Breaking up with me on text out of the blue. He said hes not allowed to go to boxing anymore or go out in general because his dad threatened him that harshly after seeing his grades. I questioned whether he was telling the truth or not and my friend suggested to see if he was lying by going to the place he trains. The next day I decided to check it out with my friends. Unfortunately we didn't get a proper view to confirm he wasn't there.

I processed the break up pretty quickly and I admit we should've developed our feelings better but its just hurtful being told things that ""you are the one"" or the ""loml"" and then a week after you progress physically, he breaks up with you. For context he was my first kiss and I made out with him which was such a big deal for me. I will say I am grateful for what occured but I feel so lead on and clearly I didn't mean that much to him if he could just switch up his feelings like that. I don't exactly hate him but my view of him has changed to an immature selfish jerk. I could go on and on about the details but I dont want yall reading this for ages haha.

",Everyone Sucks,2024-10-06,"AITA for checking to see if my ex lied about not being able to meet me after the breakup? Hi I recently have gone through a breakup and would like to get opinions on this. I do admit its not some crazy intense story like some others that are posted on this AITA community.

I (19F) and my ex (18M) met at work and didn't interact often due to the different areas we work at. At the start of this year we had our first proper conversation since I started working at this job. I went up to him and we got along pretty well. At the start of July I noticed he started liking my stories on insta and things between us progressed to a talking stage. We started dating at the end of August but because we go to different universities and he quit the job, we never got to see each other until mid September.
I admit things progressed very fast between us but I did know what I was getting into and made sure that he was sure with what he wanted.

Out of the blue, on National Boyfriends Day, he breaks up with me. He told me that his parents were disappointed with his performance at university and that made him realise his main priority is school. I found it such a jerk move because we both established that we have future plans we need to focus on and that it's understandable if we are busy. Even though we had good communication clearly he didn't communicate his priorities enough before progressing this relationship further.

51,1fxakla,AITA for worrying my school and my mom?,"I (15F) have been having a rough time lately. I’ve been getting bullied at school by a lot of kids in my homeroom. They constantly call me ugly, mock my appearance (especially my forehead), and even make fun of me by saying I’m autistic (which I’m not). On top of that, I’ve been incredibly stressed with schoolwork and tests, and everything just felt overwhelming.

The tipping point happened after a computer science test. I didn’t get enough time to study for it because I had been busy cramming for math. I was convinced I had failed and, at that moment, it felt like too much. I asked to go to the bathroom, but instead of going, I ended up at a balcony (2 floors up) and almost did something dangerous—I had my leg up like I was ready to jump. Thankfully, a teacher and a classmate saw me, and I was quickly taken to the office.

They tried to reassure me, saying everything was going to be okay, and I spent the rest of that period and part of lunch in the office. When it was time to go home, though, the school didn’t let me take the bus. They thought I might harm myself on the way home (which seemed odd to me because how would I even do that on a bus?). Instead, they called my mom and told her everything, including the fact that I have OCD and social anxiety (which I didn’t really want to share with them, but I let it slip).

When my mom picked me up, she was mad. She couldn’t understand why I’d told the school about my mental health issues, and because of the incident, we were sent to the hospital for an emergency evaluation. I had to answer some pretty tough questions, like whether I wanted to die.

Now, I’ve been told to stay home from school for a week, and I’m being sent to therapy for my mental health. I feel ashamed about what happened and guilty for worrying everyone. My mom seems upset, and I feel like maybe I overreacted and caused a lot of unnecessary drama. So, AITA?

However, we had a group activity which also required the output to be presented before class ended. I was grouped with some guys he didn't like (and 4 other girls). He kept staring daggers at me, chatting me I should keep on moving because the guys were ""surrounding"" me and facing me. I already moved to not be near the guys he didn't like. It wasn't enough. Mind you, I was also using a laptop for our output which he said wasn't even useful because my other group member already had a laptop.

After class, he said that he'll cancel our months-long planned date so that I could learn from my mistake. I should've known that this would happen because I know what he likes and doesn't like. He kept saying that I'm a sl*t and a show-off for using my laptop to get guys' attentions.

Is that even right?

(edited due to misunderstandings) 
Also, a week before our anniversary, he said he would make it up to me. 

He ruined my birthday a few weeks ago because my family made plans and he got mad he wasn't able to come with me. Which meant he wasn't able to ensure that I was behaving myself since it was out of town.
 And after that, he joined four different sports for the University Intramurals so he was so busy with that and being in his organization. 

I already gave him a chance to make up for these incidents by attending a party with him a few days back, but he was busy again with organizing the party (He was enjoying so he didn't mind being busy, his other orgmates were partying without him). So the ending of that party was me going having to go home early (curfew) without enjoying anything or taking a picture with him because he was sooooo busy and he wanted me to just sit there and wait for him. Haha.

Idek anymore. Yesterday, he said two years with me was already enough. I was too tiring and sickening to be with. I was too demanding when it comes to his attention and time which I ""don't deserve because of how I act around guys""). (I don't even interact with guys. I cut off all guy friendships.

53,1fxa60j,AITA for telling my roommate that someone couldn’t come to game night?,"Me and my roommate, both 20m, are acquaintances with a guy i’ll call Jake. Jake was friends with my roommate and introduced us but he dropped out the next year and hasn’t been doing much. I feel really bad because Jake has autism and I know he doesn’t mean any harm, but he’s not someone I can see myself being friends with.

Last year Jake confessed to having a crush on me, but we’d only hung out twice and barely knew each other. He said how cute I was and that he wanted to kiss me. We’re all queer but I was not interested and also not looking for a relationship so I said no thanks, he didn’t take any offense to it but I was a little uncomfortable the next time he was invited over (me and my roommate weren’t living together yet).

He then told me over text a few months later that he thought my roommate was cute, I changed the topic and I don’t think he pursued it but that was also awkward. He texts us both a lot, mostly just random pictures and memes. He comments on every single thing I post and likes every single story, and on tiktok he looked through my roommates followers and found my account to follow me, he only has like 10 followers but still weirded me out a bit. 

He always asks my roommate if he can come over and hang out with us, we both don’t really want to but we can’t constantly blow him off or ignore him. Again I feel bad saying this because he is autistic but whenever we see him he constantly talks about his special interest/ and nothing else, I listen and am interested to learn but that’s all he has to say. He also follows very close behind me sometimes in stores which startles me if I don’t realize he’s there.

My roommate asked if he can come over this Saturday because he’s been asking. We had prior plans with friends for a board game night, I admit this was kind of a dick move but I asked if we could take him back home before my friends came over. I would be uncomfortable the whole time and I’m not sure if my friends would get along with him. 

My roommate was half joking but said that my friends sounded judgmental since I was worried they wouldn’t like him. I said that I don’t like hanging out with him and my roommate said why he’s just autistic which made me feel bad, but he doesn’t like hanging out with him either and also the crush stuff did make me feel weird since I can tell he’s clearly still interested.

I don’t know how to kindly distance myself from him, I don’t text back besides just liking what he sends me.

At the end of last year, I got into a really toxic, emotionally abuse relationship that lasted for nearly 6 months. I met this guy through my best friend. They were friends through work for around 2 years, and considered each other work best friends.

I confided in my friend about all the awful things he put me through. For some context, this guy would always degrade me by calling me fat and ugly, he downloaded tinder during our time together, would constantly gaslight me etc. When I finally cut things off with him in early April, she still remained friends with him. I overlooked it at first because they were friends before I was in the picture, but it still rubbed me the wrong way.

When we were no longer together, I noticed that she would still hang out with him, such as inviting him to parties, or even sharing hotel rooms, and she'd still constantly be messaging him. Everytime they hung out she would send me pictures of him, or post pictures of them together on her stories or Instagram. I tried not to let it get to me but I was still really hurt by her actions. He lives far out of the city we are from, so my last straw was when she drove over an hour to go and hang out with him. Then again, she proceeded to send me photos of them hanging out together.

I confronted her about it and said it feels like she doesn't respect me as a friend when she hangs out with him. She excused it by saying it wasn't her idea to hang out with him, and she didn't plan to hang out with, nor did she plan to send me photos of them together. She said that they have a friendship before me and she can't just throw that away. I understand that they had a friendship before me, but I still can't help from feeling betrayed.

I have always had certain problems with my family and they have often led to really messy situations. I am not saying I hate my parents, but its just pretty hard to get on the right foot sometimes. Its mainly because of my father's anger issues. My father would get into fights into the streets pretty often over petty things. I feel like my mother also is no longer the idol for me she used to be. Maybe it is because of my dad? But she has also started to rage over really small things.

As a typical teenager, I have had body image issues too. Nothing really drastic just wishing what if this part of me was different or something like that. My parents have added to this issue. I have had a bit of white hair since young age. My mum tells me that its my job' to cover up my white hair and regularly dye it. When I confronted them with saying that it is like saying, 'oh you're fat, you should wear loose clothes to cover up' and how my mother being a woman herself should understand this; she told me that we being a family, can share things like that with each other. She also mentioned now the family is only composed of them 3 only since I don't let them share anything.

So this was the entire context and background, I really felt like I needed to give that because it would aid in understanding why my relationship with my parents is a lil strained and how it is hard for me to deal with certain situation.

A while ago before I was dating my current gf my girl best friend started talking to this guy I didn’t really like. Long story short it turned out to be my current gfs ex boyfriend.

However my gf has held this huge hatred for my girl best friend our whole relationship and refuses to ever have a conversation about it with my girl best friend. I don’t expect them to hash it out…but it’s been 2 years. My gf knows that this girl is like my sister. There has never and will never be anything romantic between us. And it feels like this is the only thing we ever argue about. We live together and have two adorable cats. Yet every time my girl best friend is mentioned my gf has something mean to say about her. 
Today my friend had a rave she was playing at and texted me to ask if I wanted to go. I said yes because since I’ve started dating my gf I’ve minimized the time I spent with my friend. We used to hang out every day and now we only see each other occasionally. I said yes to the show and she added me and my gf in her guest list. On our way there I got out of the car to buy some blunts because my gf my friend and I are very big stoners. I had texted my friend earlier that day “I have a blunt with our names on it 🙈” 
Exactly that. 
My gf saw the text in my phone and brought up that she had a huge problem with the text I sent her. She said she didn’t like that I said I have a blunt with “your” name on it. 
I corrected her but she quickly told me that she didn’t like that the message was all cutesy. I reiterated that it wasn’t and showed her the convo. She didn’t care and reminded me how she doesn’t like her.
After not seeing my friend for such a long time this kinda broke me. I really love my friend and I love my gf but it’s always weird knowing my gf really doesn’t like my friend so I asked if she can just take me home.
Mind you my gf has already gotten guest list from one of her friends working the rave. She began to cry and tell me it’s not fair for me to ruin her night because I didn’t wanna go anymore. I’m so confused emotionally and hurt. I really do miss hanging out with my friend because she was like my big sister and I’ve never had sibling but I always saw her as a big sister to me. And I love my gf so much I don’t wanna hurt her. What do I do?!? I’m currently sleeping in our couch because my gf wants nothing to do with me. Am I the Asshole here?!?

58,1fx9cpl,AITA for telling my friend that she's not a good person?,"I (18f) and my best friend Sam (17m) met Molly (18f) a few years ago, and while we were close friends for a while, Molly wasn’t always pleasant to be around. She would constantly bring up petty issues and old grudges, like not being invited to FaceTime once, and hold them over our heads to make us feel guilty.

She would also question our religion, assume we were atheists, and spread false rumors about us. For example, she lied to Sam, saying I compared my traumas to his, which wasn’t true. Molly often talked behind our backs, trying to make herself seem innocent.

In July 2024, Sam and our other friend Jennie (17f) had a small argument about being distant from one another. Molly inserted herself into the situation, making it about her and claiming Jennie never wanted to hang out. However, Jennie had invited Molly to hang out that same day, but Molly didn’t respond, later claiming she had a panic attack for three hours. In reality, she was on FaceTime with Sam during that time. Molly took over the conversation, preventing Sam and Jennie from resolving their issue.

Later, Sam and Jennie made up privately because Sam was afraid of Molly’s reaction. In the past, when Sam was friends with someone Molly hated, she attacked him on social media. Molly found out about their reconciliation and confronted Sam. When he gave her valid reasons for distancing himself (like her being rude and talking behind his back) she defended herself instead of acknowledging the problem. Molly would insult Sam, scream at friends over video games, and talk badly about him behind his back.

After this, Molly sent Sam a long apology, but it felt insincere since it was the same excuses she’d been giving for two years. A mutual friend confirmed the apology wasn’t genuine, so Sam didn’t respond. Two weeks later, Molly texted Sam, accusing him of lying, though the only time he lied was about why she wasn’t invited to hang out. He apologized, but she continued to accuse him and brought up irrelevant old arguments. They argued for two hours, with Molly refusing to move on.

I was fed up with her immaturity and refusal to see other perspectives, so I sent her a long message explaining how she had made Sam, me, and others feel worthless. She tried to manipulate us by rubbing friendships in our faces, trying to make our lives a ""living hell"", and using people against us. When we started standing up for ourselves, she acted betrayed.

I told her that until she stopped seeing friendships as transactional, we shouldn’t stay in contact. I hoped she would take what I said into consideration and work on herself.

I tried talking to her about it and she said she was stuck in the house for months because she was too broke to enjoy life. She’s going to enjoy life. So I told her I could come too. And she no it’s a girls trip. I honestly don’t like the idea of her traveling without me especially to Miami. I don’t mind her traveling but, if she’s traveling i would like to go to. She mentioned that I travel all the time without her but, I usually visit family or go on work trips. She’s literally going to Miami to go clubbing with her single friends.
While I trust her and don’t think she’s going to cheat she’s going to invite men to her. For the simple fact that her friends are going to be okay with men walking up and talking to them.

Mia moved in with us about two years ago after dealing with personal struggles, including the passing of their father. At the time, Mia was experiencing anxiety attacks, and Sarah wanted to support her in getting back on her feet.

For the past two years, Mia hasn't been contributing financially to our household. She wasn't cleaning, cooking, or helping out with chores, which put a strain on our living situation. Despite this, Sarah and I managed to keep things running smoothly, largely because Mia was going through a tough time.

Less than a month ago, Mia secured a part-time job. While her income isn't substantial, it’s enough to cover at least one household bill, like electricity, for example.


Before getting her job, Mia sometimes contributed minimally when she had extra money, often spending it on clothes for herself instead.


 Mia's participation in household chores is minimal. The only thing she occasionally does is the dishes, and nothing else.


Mia no longer experiences anxiety and hasn't expressed any interest in increasing her involvement in the household or her job situation.

I thought it was a positive step that Mia now has a source of income, so I suggested to Sarah that Mia could start contributing something towards the household expenses. My reasoning was that even a small contribution could help alleviate some of the financial pressure and encourage Mia to take more responsibility.

However, Sarah didn't take this suggestion well. She got really annoyed, and we ended up having a heated argument. She explained that she doesn't want Mia to feel pressured to contribute, especially since her part-time job doesn't pay well. Sarah emphasized that she wants her sister to have a better paycheck before asking her to contribute. 
 
I understand where Sarah is coming from and appreciate her desire to support Mia. However, I also feel that Mia should start taking some responsibility, especially now that she's earning an income. The current situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable for me financially and emotionally. Renting an apartment for the past two years has been ok, but with Mia not contributing, it's putting a strain on us.

So AITA for suggesting that my sister-in-law contribute financially to our household now that she has a part-time job ?

TL;DR: I suggested to my girlfriend that her sister, who recently got a part-time job, should start contributing financially to our rented apartment.

I thought it was a positive step that Mia now has a source of income, so I suggested to Sarah that Mia could start contributing something towards the household expenses. My reasoning was that even a small contribution could help alleviate some of the financial pressure and encourage Mia to take more responsibility.

However, Sarah didn't take this suggestion well. She got really annoyed, and we ended up having a heated argument. She explained that she doesn't want Mia to feel pressured to contribute, especially since her part-time job doesn't pay well. Sarah emphasized that she wants her sister to have a better paycheck before asking her to contribute. 
 
I understand where Sarah is coming from and appreciate her desire to support Mia. However, I also feel that Mia should start taking some responsibility, especially now that she's earning an income. The current situation is becoming increasingly unsustainable for me financially and emotionally. Renting an apartment for the past two years has been ok, but with Mia not contributing, it's putting a strain on us.

So AITA for suggesting that my sister-in-law contribute financially to our household now that she has a part-time job ?

TL;DR: I suggested to my girlfriend that her sister, who recently got a part-time job, should start contributing financially to our rented apartment. My girlfriend got upset, wanting to continue supporting her sister without adding financial pressure. AITA for wanting her to help out now that she’s earning money?

He comes homes and expect everything to be fine between us flipping it on me that I wouldnt let him go and I wouldn't have gone with him
So am I the asshole for not forgiving him?
Some background his cousin moved to Italy. A cousin who never speak to him when hes home. He claims he went to help her move her stuff back. His family really doesnt have any thing to do with him in all the years we've been together 
I feel like he chose them over me when I've always put him before everyone. 
In August he said that maybe we should go to Italy before she comes home cause we could stay with her. I said I would of love to then he just springs on me that he's at the f*cking airport. I told him if he went I wouldn't forgive him. Now hes flipping it on me that Im wrong and he didn't do anything wrong!

Some backstory on Fred is that he had this long term GF, let’s call her Mary, for about 4 years and it had recently been broken off a few months prior to this. Apparently he had at some point in the relationship cheated, and they reconciled but it just started to breakdown and the broke up. This whole situation came out of left field as he was such a mild mannered guy, and to everyone this all looked like a rebound relationship for comfort or something idk.

Word gets around quick to the friend group and a couple people step forward and confront him including me.

74,1fx6u02,"AITA, for not having more sympathy? ","AITA, for not siding with my disabled uncle. 

So in 2018 we discovered that my uncle (60) had a stroke leaving him unable to care for himself. My parents didn't have the finances or room but took him in anyway free of charge. In 2020 he had a second larger stroke, leaving him more severely disabled. He is partially blind and does not have full control over his body anymore. 

When my uncle moved in he asked that his beloved Jeep Wrangler come with him. He asked my father (62) to help him care for it since he was physically not able to any longer and my father is very Auto Savy. 

This year, my father found himself unemployed. To save on bills, he sold his Truck to save on monthly Paymemts. He assumed it would be okay to use my uncles jeep since he has been caring for it for it for the past 6 years. To clarify, he never officially asked. This pissed off my uncle. He feels like his property has been violated. However, instead of telling my father how he felt, he just aired his grievances to the rest of the family, but never once told my father ANY of this. 
Sidenote: my father has been taking this man to his Appointments, to the grocery store for his personal treats and snacks, has taken him out on drives in the Jeep since he can't do any of this on his own, all at a moments notice and has never once complained about this. 

Recently, my dad found a new job that is out of state and he needs a means of getting there and driving to and from the site. We told him how upset my uncle was about the jeep and so he went and formally asked for his permission to use it. My uncle flat out refused him. 

As my father is the main provider of the household and bills are getting tight, this caused a serious issue. So I offered my vehicle for him to use. I have 2 kids, who have appointments and extracurriculars 4 out of 5 days of the week. So this has caused an issue in my personal life as well, but it had to be done otherwise we would have lost the house. 

So now my dad is out of state, I'm out of a car,  And my uncle is looking for sympathy as he believes he is the wronged party. This is a man who has not provided anything on account of his disability, and when given an opportunity to help out the family, he refused out of spite. Now he is walking around the household acting like he is in the right, and trying to get us to agree. Me and my husband aren't siding with him, since we were the ones who were inconvinced by this. When he tries to talk to us, we don't engage or just blankly answer.

The part where I feel like I'm the asshole is that I feel like I don't have enough sympathy for him. To put in perspective, my father took a car that was being used for appointments, grocery trips, family outings, and other things, over a Jeep that just sits there. Now my uncle is threatening to move out and take his jeep to a assisted living facility because he says ""it's too tense here"".

Recently, my dad found a new job that is out of state and he needs a means of getting there and driving to and from the site. We told him how upset my uncle was about the jeep and so he went and formally asked for his permission to use it. My uncle flat out refused him. 

As my father is the main provider of the household and bills are getting tight, this caused a serious issue. So I offered my vehicle for him to use. I have 2 kids, who have appointments and extracurriculars 4 out of 5 days of the week. So this has caused an issue in my personal life as well, but it had to be done otherwise we would have lost the house. 

So now my dad is out of state, I'm out of a car,  And my uncle is looking for sympathy as he believes he is the wronged party. This is a man who has not provided anything on account of his disability, and when given an opportunity to help out the family, he refused out of spite. Now he is walking around the household acting like he is in the right, and trying to get us to agree. Me and my husband aren't siding with him, since we were the ones who were inconvinced by this. When he tries to talk to us, we don't engage or just blankly answer.

The part where I feel like I'm the asshole is that I feel like I don't have enough sympathy for him. To put in perspective, my father took a car that was being used for appointments, grocery trips, family outings, and other things, over a Jeep that just sits there. Now my uncle is threatening to move out and take his jeep to a assisted living facility because he says ""it's too tense here"".

75,1fx6t0o,AITA for moving out when family is financially struggling and is in need of help with child care?,"I am 23F Asian - I live in an apartment in Australia with my dad, his girlfriend and their 10 year old son - he has a learning disability. My mum lives nearby and is also still with my dad. Think of it as having two wives. I was raised by my uncle and aunt from my dad's side and I never really got to live with my parents until I turned 17 - I moved here to live with them.

Ever since I got here, I was often required to help out with child care: a little bit when I was a student and now that I am working a full time job, I do more help than what my dad and mum currently does. Of course it is not my mum's responsibility as she is not the mother of my sibling, but before I moved here, she often took care of him because she considers him as her own son. I don't get paid for child care since we're family anyway: they spent a lot for me to be able to live here and I did not pay any rent for my first 3 years here. I do night shifts permanently and my dad's gf helped me get this job since she's one of the executives there.

It's not just the child care... My dad got into drugs and into buying rare collector's items. He has now stopped sending us rent money so it is just his gf and I paying for it - I don't know how he's still able to buy himself expensive things when he's on debt already. Half of my wages go to the rent while I also still have my own bills to pay so I don't really get much money left for me to save. My mum and my dad's gf work around 13 to 15 hours per day most of the time. With my dad's gf, her reason is: she needs money to mainly take care of her son and to be able to pay all the necessary things.

I mentioned to them long ago that I wanted to move out and was told not to YET. ""Not until your sibling is ready to be on his own"" which is probably around 13 to 15 years old.  I wouldn't mind waiting a few more years but the situation at home's getting worse and none of them are refusing to change things. An example would be how it's getting messier in our home that my dad moved his belongings to the bathroom and considers it as his bedroom now - yes, he sleeps there too.

I now have a tenancy agreement with my friend. The place is just a 2-hour drive from here to there. I'll sadly have to look for a new job. My friend insisted that she will pay the first 2 or 3 months I'm not living with her there to help me out only because: I want to give my family that much time to sort things out - I will still pay my usual share at home while I'm still here with them but is it fair for me to give my family that much time to sort things out or should I have waited more instead? My family would be at risk of losing their job since they'll have to cut down their work hours if they'll have to adjust it to be able to take care of their child.

76,1fx6fhu,AITA for “stealing” my roommate’s cat.,"I (F22) recently moved into an apartment with a friend and roommate (M23). From day 1 I made it clear to him that I wanted to adopt a cat. It would be the apartment’s cat (we have two other roommates), but I would be the main owner, taking responsibility and bringing the cat when I moved out. It’s not something I take lightly, as having a cat is a commitment for the next 15+ years. 

I got in contact with a cat foster parent through a mutual friend who sent me pictures of two cats, a boy tuxedo and a girl calico. I sent these pictures to the apartment gc and my roommate said he instantly fell in love with the girl cat. I said I was leaning towards the boy, but wanted to meet them to see their personalities. He said that he had to get the girl cat, and that I could adopt the other one. 

Ok, well our third roommate is hesitant about having two cats. I’m also hesitant. It’s a lot to go from 0 to 2. He tries to convince her by saying he’ll put the litter box in his room. He says we need two cats.

We go to meet the girl calico cat together and both fall in love with her, she’s super sweet. No joke me and the foster thought of the same name for her independently. It seems like a done deal. But my roommate is saying that it’s going to be his cat, that he has a claim on her because I initially said my preference was for the other cat. But that was only based on a picture without even meeting them!

We’ve argued a lot about this. I don’t want to let it interfere with our friendship overall, but it’s making me angry at him. I was really excited to have a cat of my own. It’s annoying to me because he could have adopted a cat at any point in the last year living in this apartment, and he waits for me to set everything up, and now expects that it’s his cat. I’m afraid if I give in to this we’re not going to get another cat for whatever reason, and I’ll have to wait another year to have a pet of my own. 

I talked to my parents about this and they think I should just be the bigger person and adopt a different cat, that I’ll just find another one. It just feels very unfair to me. As of now, my roommate is unemployed, while I have a job. He’s never had a cat before, but has pet sit for his girlfriend’s. He’s given me all sorts of reasons why this NEEDS to be his cat.

She’d always been what people called a “player” and was often hated in my friend group. One day I decided to befriend her, just thinking that maybe she was misunderstood. Me and her got along really well and started sharing our boy drama. 

She’s would tell me about this one boy (we’ll call him Andrew) who she would talk to on the phone 24/7 (she met him irl but he moved). He wasn’t allowed to date yet so they were just friends with benefits. Then she started talking to another guy, while still talking to Andrew. Her and this other guy got along greatly and were practically dating (even while she was still in contact with Andrew). Eventually Emma and Andrew fell apart and she replaced him with ANOTHER BOY.

Now, her and this other boy are still dating to this day, but he was one of my closest friends.

So about a week before prom Andrew moves back into town and we start hanging out. Me and Emma had already started falling out since she ditched me for her new boyfriend (my close friend) and it’s been a few months so I thought it would be okay.

80,1fx54jl,AITA for asking my husband not to go to the gym during dinner/bath/bed time routine?,"I really don't think I'm the AH but I'll apologise if I am. 

Some context: 

My (f32) husband (m33) and I have been married ten years and we have a 3.5 year old son together. I'm also currently 6 months pregnant. We're both working full-time hours, though my husband (S) leaves at 5 for an hour commute and is usually home before 4. These times depend on the amount of traffic as it's actually only a 25 minutes drive/ride without traffic.

S also works irregular shifts - he was on nights last week and didn't help at all with our son and often goes away, usually for weeks but sometimes for months at a time. During these periods I'm on my own and solo parenting without support as our families aren't anywhere near us.

EDIT TO ADD: He currently has a 1 hour PT session every day at work. So this gym session is literally something he's adding on top. I would be more understanding of the timing of this was the only time he had to go to the gym to keep up his fitness.

The issue:

S needs to keep a certain level of fitness for his job. He has access to a complete free gym and pool at his job, but he refuses to use it and wants to use one closer to our house. After 6 months of indecision, he finally joined one yesterday morning. I went out and did the groceries while he was with our son, and then he had a lay down for an hour and then we swapped and I had a snooze for about half an hour until it was time to get up for dinner. I come out and he's said he's going to the gym. 
I've asked if he can maybe avoid going at bed Bath and dinner time routines as it's hard work, especially as I'm 6 months pregnant and really exhausted with working full time.
S has gotten angry at me for ""dictating"" things to him and accused me of not supporting him. I may be an AH because I laughed at him and said that if I didn't support him, I wouldn't have just uprooted my entire life, move interstate and give up a well paying and secure job to support him and his dream. I told him I genuinely didn't care what other time he went, I was just asking him to be considerate of the challenging time that was dinner bed bath, and to pick any other time. 
There was more back and forth, but that's the crux of the matter. 
He's been cranky at me ever since, refused to sleep in our bed (went to the spare room) and has basically ignored me since (though will engage if I make the effort to first).

81,1fx4r2i,AITA for asking my husband what he thought of my hair?,"I’ve (F30) been married to my husband (M38) for almost three years, we’ve been together for 5 and have a toddler. Today I went to the salon and when I got back I asked him what he thought. He said “it’s straight and looks the same” (typical response 😂) but after that he got super short with me. Eventually I asked him if everything was alright and he said yes. Thinking he had a lot on his mind, I just put clothes away before playing with our toddler.

He then proceeded to blow up on me, saying that I ruined the day and called me an asshole, childish, crazy and a few other things for putting “bullshit expectations” on him. He then said he hates it in our house and stormed out, leaving me completely bewildered and in tears. I followed him outside and tried to apologize for whatever it was that I did, only for him to say that I never take accountability and that everything is always his fault. From what I gathered, he thought I was mad at him and his default was to get mad back I guess? When I told him I wasn’t angry, that I found his comment funny, he sneered and said “not so funny now, is it?” before going inside and retreating to his man cave.

He’s been doing this more and more the last few months. He invents or looks for reasons to fight with me, and then uses it as an opportunity to belittle me and gaslight me. It’s to the point that I feel like he’s trying to get me to divorce him but when I ask him if that’s what he wants, he says things like “I’m not even going to answer that. If you want space, fucking create it.” Our physical intimacy is non existent and if I didn’t ask for hugs or him to hold my hand, there wouldn’t be any at all. I’m always quick to apologize when I’m in the wrong because in my mind, we’re a team and I love him, but it’s honestly just emotionally draining at this point and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells. 

AITA for asking my husband what he thought of my hair?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-06,"AITA for asking my husband what he thought of my hair? I’ve (F30) been married to my husband (M38) for almost three years, we’ve been together for 5 and have a toddler. Today I went to the salon and when I got back I asked him what he thought. He said “it’s straight and looks the same” (typical response 😂) but after that he got super short with me. Eventually I asked him if everything was alright and he said yes. Thinking he had a lot on his mind, I just put clothes away before playing with our toddler.

He then proceeded to blow up on me, saying that I ruined the day and called me an asshole, childish, crazy and a few other things for putting “bullshit expectations” on him. He then said he hates it in our house and stormed out, leaving me completely bewildered and in tears. I followed him outside and tried to apologize for whatever it was that I did, only for him to say that I never take accountability and that everything is always his fault. From what I gathered, he thought I was mad at him and his default was to get mad back I guess? When I told him I wasn’t angry, that I found his comment funny, he sneered and said “not so funny now, is it?” before going inside and retreating to his man cave.

He’s been doing this more and more the last few months. He invents or looks for reasons to fight with me, and then uses it as an opportunity to belittle me and gaslight me. It’s to the point that I feel like he’s trying to get me to divorce him but when I ask him if that’s what he wants, he says things like “I’m not even going to answer that. If you want space, fucking create it.” Our physical intimacy is non existent and if I didn’t ask for hugs or him to hold my hand, there wouldn’t be any at all. I’m always quick to apologize when I’m in the wrong because in my mind, we’re a team and I love him, but it’s honestly just emotionally draining at this point and I feel like I’m walking on eggshells.

82,1fx4hvd,AITAH for cancelling all of our streaming services to hire a housekeeper without asking my husband first,"My (28f) and my husband (30m) just welcomed our first baby almost 3 months ago. Understandably it has been a huge adjustment for both of us. She’s still not sleeping through the night and we’re both back to work full time. We have always split the household responsibilities 50/50. We just help where needed and it’s always worked out well. 

Lately, my husband has been doing the chores terribly and I’ve had to come behind him to fix things or clean them again. For example, he cleaned the bottles the other night and they were cleaned so poorly I had to do them again. He dropped pump parts down the disposal and then ran it ruining them. There have been several clothes that he didn’t clean after a blowout that are now ruined. There are many more instances like this. I’ve confronted him a few times letting him know we all make mistakes and I know we’re both tired but it feels like he’s not even trying to do things well. He just keeps saying he’s so tired and is having a hard time working and taking care of the house and baby.  I do sympathize with this as I’m also working, pumping, recovering, and taking care of the house and baby. 

The final straw for me was when he told me to go to sleep and he’d put up the milk I’d just pumped and finish the dishes. I was so grateful until I got up and realized the milk had been sitting on the counter and at this point was no good anymore. He said he was sorry and he put on a show to relax for a bit before doing the dishes and fell asleep. The next day I decided to cancel all of our streaming services, PlayStation plus, and our theme park passes in order to hire a housekeeper. I figured if he’s too tired to do basic household chores than a housekeeper is necessary. If he’s too tired to put milk up, then he’s too tired to play video games or for us to go to a theme park. We still have cable and the PlayStation games and can do other activities outside of the local theme park. He blew up at me and said I had no right doing that and was furious. I thought I was doing us a favor so we can get more sleep and not worry as much about household tasks. So AITAH for hiring a housekeeper without asking? 

Edit to add: I see a lot of comments about communication. I have been communicating NONSTOP about my needs and my expectations. Ive let a lot of mistakes slide because I know this is hard for both of us, but when it became a daily thing I let him know if he’s unable to do his part, then I need additional help. I mentioned hiring some help, and he laughed and said “what a ridiculous waste of money.” I knew if I asked again, the answer would be no, so I made the decision for both of us. 

Also, I didn’t throw away the tv or PlayStation. I just cancelled our subscriptions for them. We were paying around $100 between the two. Our internet includes a handful of cable channels and peacock and we have plenty of PlayStation games that we can still play. We both play video games and watch tv. I probably watch more on steaming so cancelling them affects both of us.

Housekeeping is $300 a month and everything I cancelled including Disney passes is about $230 so it won’t be as much of a financial burden. Plus it will save more money as well since I won’t have to replace destroyed pump parts, clothes, and breast milk.

83,1fx47r5,AITA for refusing to give up my macebell?,"I started doing macebell swinging quite recently. Thinking it's quite a good exercice. Building up. Started with a 5kg macebell. Kept the 5kg and have added a 7.5kg, 10kg, 12.5kg, 13.6kg(30lb) and 15kg to my collection. They are not all the same brand which is why there are differences, I also have a 20kg and 25kg which I'm not quite ready for.

Anyway, I live with my father, his friend was visiting. His son doesn't exercise much, Kind of like me before I discovered macebells. He saw me doing 360s with them and commented that it looked like a goodd way to work out. 

He then talked about gettng his son in to macebell swinging. I agreed that would be a good idea. He asked about taking one of my lighter ones. I said I still use them. I like do go for a higher number of swings with a small one or a few swings with a big one. Then he asked if he could have my 13.6kg mace. Given that it is pretty close in weight to either my 12.5kg or my 15kg. 

I told him that it was an expensive macebell, I do not wish to part with it and it wouldn't even be a good idea to start him off on that one anyway. 

He was annoyed about that. My father thought I was being selfish because I have macebells close in weight to the one he was asking for. I want to keep it and even if I was giving it away it would be to one of my friends.

84,1fx42h4,AITA for refusing to drive my mums friend home after they threatened to be sick ,"I offered to drive my mum and some friends to and from an oktoberfest about 30 minutes drive from home. both my mum and her friends are pretty mature when it comes to alcohol, usually they just get a little tipsy and then call it quits. Because of this was initially fine to drive them home at around 12 at night when the festival ended. 

I arrive to pick them up and they are obviously pretty shit faced, they could barely get in the car without falling over so I was instantly regretting offering. My mum is pretty sober in comparison but the others are gone. 

When I was about to move off sombody in the back seat randomly got out saying 'im walking to the next pub' the then ran off down the road. 

I drive around for a bit looking for her and I find her stumbling in the middle of an A-road (60mph speed limit) and blocking traffic. I pull over and manage to get her in the car. I'm extremely angry at this point and I felt like just driving home alone. 

The same lady then threatened to be sick so I quickly pulled over and forced her out of my car onto a pavement where she began to spit etc. 

I gave in and ordered a taxi for them and made all the other friends sit on the curb. I waited for it to show up, then I drive home with just my mum, who was equally as annoyed as I was. 

I'm feeling pretty bad for making them pay £50+ for the taxi especially after I offered to drive them. On the other hand they aren't kids anymore, in fact they are all over 40. one of them apparently left their phone at home which is an extremely irresponsible thing to do when going on a night out. The fact I had to search for one of them and stop them from getting ran over is crazy. 

I'm also pretty pissed with my mum too, I've made it apparent how much I hate dealing with drunkards in the past. 

Let me know what you think.
