0,1fygt3w,AITA for not visiting my father more?,"I (30sNB) and my father (73M) have always had a tumultuous relationship. I won't get into it, but this is about the guilt I feel toward not visiting. I don't visit him, and I don't let him visit me either. During lockdown, I was away from my dad, and the longer I was away, the harder it was to visit again. I haven’t visited him or been visited by him now since lockdown. I talk to him daily through texts and phone calls, but not visits.

Recently, I realized I was afraid of my father, which is why visits are hard for me.

A couple of years before lockdown, my dad did something a bit extreme but not out of character for him. 

Back then, I had a stalker, and it greatly impacted my life. I wound up losing my job and had financial trouble. My job and leasing office contacted my dad as my emergency contact and said I needed help because I was in a mental health crisis and was being stalked. I didn’t know this. He just told me he knew I got fired. He gave me the option to come back home or become homeless. He pretended to be me to cancel my credit cards, bank accounts, and lease and froze my credit so I couldn’t open anything new, leaving me with only his option. He bought me a plane ticket to go back home.

Once home, the stalking stopped, but my dad still never addressed it. He just treated me like I was being emotional and I had failed at life. He would frequently insult me. There was no lock on my bedroom door, so I couldn’t escape that either. He weaponized my stepmom against me by lying to her about what had happened. I still didn’t know he knew about the stalking, and I was too afraid to tell him. 

I had no money, no phone, and the landline and router were disconnected and hidden. He changed my address and checked my mail. I only went out with him when he allowed it, and he hid the keys to my car and removed the tag or battery. We lived about 40 miles from any town, so walking away wasn’t really an option.

I eventually sneakily bought a phone with money he gave me when we were out. I discovered the safe where he kept the passwords and codes to reclaim my credit and identity. I watched him enter the safe code one day, and while he was out, I used my phone to take pictures of the codes and passwords so I could control my finances again. 

After that, I complied with him to make life a little better. Over time, he gave me more freedom.

Just before lockdown, he determined I was good enough to live on my own again, and I quickly moved out and locked my information down so he couldn’t ever do that again. He visited me a couple of times before lockdown but not since.

Now if I try to make plans with him it’s never simple. He wants to do things that take me away for an extended period. When I try to suggest something more reasonable, he gets mad and guilts me.

I can’t help but still feel so incredibly guilty because there’s still a big part of me that thinks maybe I’m overblowing this.

1,1fygp5f,AITA for not paying rental fees for a PENCIL?,"I, 19F am currently a sophomore University student who is taking a basic art course for a GPA boost. I'm about one month into the course and things have been going smoothly for the most part. On the second day of class, I forgot my pencil case and had no drawing utensils. Obviously, this is problematic for an art class. I asked my seat neighbor, Danielle, to lend me a pencil. The pencil she leant me was one of those nice mechanical pencils. I looked up the brand online and they go for about $21. I used the pencil for the class period but decided to hold on to it because I might need it in other classes. 

  
I was in a rush so I stuffed the pencil in my tote bag. To make a long story short, I ended up losing the pencil. When I told Danielle this, she insisted that I pay her $5 a month until the pencil is returned. I agreed in order to pacify her and because I knew she could not be serious. Last Friday, she requested my first installment. I told her I would not be paying for a pencil and that she was making a big deal since she had 2 more of the exact same pencil. She claims I have no respect for other people's property and that I'm a jerk. She's also been discussing the matter with mutual friends and making things awkward.

2,1fygoqc,AITAH for venting to a mutual friend why I broke up with my ex? Now my ex is pissed at me.,"It's a long story but I'll be quick. I broke up with my ex over a month ago because he got a DUI after going to a strip club. I felt betrayed because I thought he was home but turns out he wasn't, he was out having too much fun. Anyway I broke up with him and he asked me to not tell my friends about what happened. At the moment I agreed because I felt for him. Even though he messed up I still cared for him so I respected his request. After a few weeks passed I was trying to deal with the break up and met up with a friend whom I thought I could vent to and trust and told her what happened. A few days later my ex calls me pissed asking me why our mutual friend knows what happened and that I shouldn't say that part of the story because it's not mine to tell as it didn't happen to me. I told him that it was part of my story too because it affected me as well in a different way. He proceeded to say that it was his story to tell and that I should only focus on my side of the story. I continue to tell
Him that is also part of mine. I ended up saying I was sorry for how things went down but that I have the right to vent/deal with my emotions my own way. The conversation ended with him saying the same to not tell people about that and not to worry about him anymore. I said that's fine I won't say anything anymore and then he hung up. 

AITAH here for venting? I'm hurt too that my friend told him about it because I thought I could trust her. I knew she was friends with him too but I thought she was still closer to me and would have common sense not to tell him what I confided in her. I texted her telling her I thought it was clear that whatever I vented to her was supposed to stay between us. She said she just wanted to make sure he was ok. That we are both her friends and cares for us the same. She said she apologized if this caused any issue. 

I understand she didn't do it with ill intentions but now I feel maybe she's not a friend a can trust.

3,1fygjw9,WIBTA if I filed a police report on a former friend?,"Back in June I had a friend who needed a place to stay. She had just moved to the city and had a job, but where her family was staying was not accessible to major transportation and she didnt have a car. She was a great roommate, quiet, cleaned up after herself, etc. and we got along just fine. She moved out the first week of Septemeber. Everything was still fine until this past weekend and we stayed in touch but she's moved to the suburbs, whereas I stayed in the city, so we didn't get to hang out as often. 

Fast forward to yesterday, Sunday. I wake up and see and email from Target, sent at 715am, with details of a purchase made for an Apple gift card. It was sent to an email address that I do not know. The alarms in my head start going off immediately. I opened the Target app to investigate and I see that the purchase was made with a card that I do not have. It was purchased with a Visa, and all of my banks use Mastercard. The card had all of my information, first and last name, and address. It was everything EXCEPT the contact number. The phone number registered for the card was the friend's number. I reached out to the friend explaining the situation with screenshots of the receipt for the purchase, and the card info. Her immediate response was to get on the defensive. She told me I was being weird, and moving funny, and that I shouldn't have even reached out to her because I should've called Target first. Needless to say, we ended the friendship right then and there on unfriendly terms. I was called toxic and the devil. Honestly, it was just plain weird. The whole interaction really just came out of left field. 

I actually did call Target, about 10 minutes after I saw the email. I changed my password but I'm not sure what else Target could do, since it technically wasn't my card. I rarely check my mail but I had a feeling that I should. It had been about three weeks since I had, and oddly enough, there was only one piece of mail in my mailbox. While I use my parent's address for my important mail, I still have my car insurance bill, electricity, and other random pieces of junk mail, etc. that come in.  Yet after three weeks, there was only one piece of mail. 

The more I think about it, the more I can't shake the feeling that this ""friend"" somehow, some way stole my identity. However, I have nothing to prove it, other than the suspicious activity in my Target app. Which honestly,  I don't even know how she would've hacked into the account. I really want to have all of my bases covered because I do not know what happened, and I do not want anything to fall back on me, since apparently there is a bank/credit card out there with my nait.and address on it.

4,1fyg9pw,AITA - 2 year old dance recital causing turmoil…,"AITA (F34)? I’m pretty sure it’s my husband (M36) being unreasonable. Our 2 year old daughter started “Tippi Toes” at her daycare this year and they are having a dance recital in December at a different facility. I invited my parents and wanted to invite his Dad as well so all the grandparents could come too. 

He (my husband) got really pissy when I let him know I invited them already and started saying “DON’T invite anyone! I just want it to be us! I feel like there is too many unknowns not knowing how to navigate it with a bunch of people.” It’s a 2 year old… it might be a shit show of crying or not doing the dances, but I think the excluding grandparents (after I already invited them) would be so rude? Plus she loves her grandparents and would be happy to have them there to cheer her on. I think he is being selfish and trying to keep special events by excluding family. 

**Edited to add: I did not ask him or discuss it with him first because I thought either A) he wouldn’t care and be glad I invited them, but also likely B) he would get mad and demand that I can’t invite grandparents at all and it would turn into a big fight because I 100% disagree.

Sure, we could have them go outside or something, but that just raises questions with him and its a topic we'd like to wait a little longer before trying to explain.

6,1fyfyvi,WIBTA If I left my husband with our dogs for a 6-week work trip? ,"Hi all, 

First time posting here. I need a little perspective. My husband (30m) and I (29f) have two dogs. They are not easy dogs, they are both high energy rescue herding breeds with some personality quirks that come with rescue. One is a puppy (~10 months)  with quite a bit of trauma that makes boarding impossible for now, but we are working to resolve it and we hope to board him in about a year. We have no kids. 

I work from home 99% of the time (aside from very rare travel), fully remote. My husband works hybrid but travels a free times a month. 

My boss called me today and asked if I can commit to travel for an optional, minimum three week window to assist with the FEMA disaster relief. He said it would be great if I could spare more than three weeks. This would be a great opportunity for me as I don’t have much work right now and would offer me overtime pay for lots of billable hours. It would also allow me to meet some coworkers and get out of the house for a while and change things up! 

There are some complications: 
1. My husband knows he has travel coming up but cannot predict how much or when. He usually has about a week’s notice and is usually gone for 3-5 days. 
2. The dog sitter isn’t available the full amount of time that I’m gone, she’s available sporadically 

To avoid leaving him high and dry with the dogs, I got permission from my parents to leave the dogs with them  for the entire time I’m gone, which maybe up 6 weeks. The only issue is that they lives 12 hours from me, so I would drive them to her then fly out of that airport in their city. Ideally I’d fly back around t-giving, spend the holiday with them, then drive them home. 

My husband is giving me weird energy around this. I had a previous opportunity (also optional) to travel 2 weeks for work which he disliked so much (due to the dogs and his schedule conflicting) that I dropped it. But I feel like I keep missing out on good work opportunities because of these challenging dogs. 

Now he thinks that driving the dogs to my parents would put too much pressure on me and I should decline this opportunity. He also said he could work with my schedule and the dog sitter for up to three weeks, keeping them home, but also said that he can’t watch them for more than 3 weeks alone. But what if I want to stay longer than 3 weeks and take full advantage of this opportunity? WIBTA? I feel like maybe we need to meet in the middle? I just need a little perspective I guess. 

Also, I feel ridiculous saying this, but I’m very sensitive - please be kind in the comments! Thanks so much. 

EDIT- thanks so much for the perspective so far, everyone. I appreciate the wake up call on a few big ticket items like the dogs’ wellbeing and the sacrifices I made when I decided to give them a forever home. I feel optimistic that with the training we’ve invested (and are continuing to do so) this won’t be as restrictive in the future. I mentioned in one of the comments that we have made great strides with the puppy already, and are working with a professional dog trainer to improve everyone’s quality of life and perhaps someday we will be able to board him and Life will be easier! 

I also wanted to take a minute to note that I made light of a disaster situation, and it wasn’t my intent. I understand the national tragedy surrounding this post and my heart goes out to the people who have lost homes and loved ones in the wake of such an event, and to those who are facing Milton soon. Please stay safe, stay alert, be prepared, and if I can be a part of the recovery I will do my best to aid in the disaster relief. Take care and be well. 

EDIT 2 - a couple ppl are suspicious of my husband. I totally get that it reads that way - I was a little testy when I made the original post. Without making a movie of our relationship for all to see and understand, suffice it to say that we have tremendous trust and an overall great relationship. I used to travel for work a LOT before we got the dogs. His hesitations are valid. If I’m gone and he has a non-negotiable work trip during that time, the dogs really must go somewhere. Also, my parents are elderly and while I think they’d all be fine, especially with a dog door and a fenced yard, it would be hard on the dogs with the change, hard on me for the drive, and hard on my parents to adjust to two high-needs dogs. And yes, everyone’s comments has helped me see that perspective better. ",Asshole,2024-10-07,"WIBTA If I left my husband with our dogs for a 6-week work trip?  Hi all,

He also said he could work with my schedule and the dog sitter for up to three weeks, keeping them home, but also said that he can’t watch them for more than 3 weeks alone. But what if I want to stay longer than 3 weeks and take full advantage of this opportunity? WIBTA? I feel like maybe we need to meet in the middle? I just need a little perspective I guess. 

Also, I feel ridiculous saying this, but I’m very sensitive - please be kind in the comments! Thanks so much. 

EDIT- thanks so much for the perspective so far, everyone. I appreciate the wake up call on a few big ticket items like the dogs’ wellbeing and the sacrifices I made when I decided to give them a forever home. I feel optimistic that with the training we’ve invested (and are continuing to do so) this won’t be as restrictive in the future. I mentioned in one of the comments that we have made great strides with the puppy already, and are working with a professional dog trainer to improve everyone’s quality of life and perhaps someday we will be able to board him and Life will be easier! 

I also wanted to take a minute to note that I made light of a disaster situation, and it wasn’t my intent. I understand the national tragedy surrounding this post and my heart goes out to the people who have lost homes and loved ones in the wake of such an event, and to those who are facing Milton soon. Please stay safe, stay alert, be prepared, and if I can be a part of the recovery I will do my best to aid in the disaster relief. Take care and be well. 

EDIT 2 - a couple ppl are suspicious of my husband. I totally get that it reads that way - I was a little testy when I made the original post. Without making a movie of our relationship for all to see and understand, suffice it to say that we have tremendous trust and an overall great relationship. I used to travel for work a LOT before we got the dogs. His hesitations are valid. If I’m gone and he has a non-negotiable work trip during that time, the dogs really must go somewhere. Also, my parents are elderly and while I think they’d all be fine, especially with a dog door and a fenced yard, it would be hard on the dogs with the change, hard on me for the drive, and hard on my parents to adjust to two high-needs dogs. And yes, everyone’s comments has helped me see that perspective better. ",1.0,1.058352,1,1

8,1fyfnpp,AITA For looking into her Phone? ,"I recently went through a breakup that happened on my birthday, September 17th, and I wanted to share my story to get some outside perspectives. We were together for three years. For the first two years, it was a long-distance relationship, but in the third year, when she moved to my region for school, I asked if she wanted to live with me, and she happily agreed. This was my first serious relationship, and while I made some mistakes, like going out with friends often (mostly for gaming and D&D), I always asked if she wanted to come along or if it was okay for me to go. She usually said she was fine with it.

We had some issues with communication. She kept a lot inside, so I was usually the one to start discussions when I noticed her mood or behavior change. I always told her that if she had something on her mind, she could tell me, and I tried to adjust my actions to make her feel more comfortable. I was always there for her emotionally, even taking the blame for situations to ease her anxiety. I stopped sleeping out to make sure I was there for her in the evenings, even if she was already asleep. Meanwhile, she could still go out with her friends, and I was happy if she was happy.

One of the main problems was our different ideas of ""being together."" For me, it was enough to be in the same room (me at my computer, her at hers) and I'd be content knowing she was there. I’d turn around occasionally, give her a kiss, and go back to what I was doing. But apparently, this wasn’t enough for her. I think this, combined with me going out with friends, made her feel more like a roommate than a partner.

Two weeks before the breakup, she told me that a friend of hers, who I'll call Luca, had confessed feelings for her. I was surprised, but we talked it out, and she assured me she didn’t feel the same way. I trusted her and told her it was fine to keep hanging out with him. Over the next couple of weeks, though, she and Luca started talking a lot—on Discord, on the phone, even falling asleep on calls. It bothered me because those were things she used to do only with me.

Then, one Sunday, after she’d spent the weekend with Luca, I came home early from a birthday party to be with her. I found her asleep on a call with him, and I messed up—I checked her phone. I found sexual messages between them, including one where she said to Luca, “I miss you, your hugs, your lips, your sighs, and being together.” When I asked her about Luca later, she said she wasn’t interested in a relationship with him “for now,” but the messages clearly said otherwise.

Our relationship had been deteriorating, but I always tried to be honest and do my best. Now I’m left dealing with feelings of anger, jealousy, and being replaced.

9,1fyfepl,AITA: My mom judges me for judging my brother for cheating on his wife,"This last week my mom (63F) told me (40F) that my step brother (36M) cheated on his wife of two years (been together on/off since she was 18) for about a year.

Below is a summary of the conversation:

My mother, who’s Christian, stated that we shouldn’t judge him for cheating because we are his family and he needs our support rather than our judgement.

My immediate reaction was “the hell I’m not! He purposefully destroyed someone’s reality so he could stroke his ego. Cheaters get no reprieve, family or not.”

She retorted that my sins are no better than his. 

I replied, “I have never initially hurt someone nor have I emotional abused someone by lying, cohesion, and manipulation to get something that I wanted.” And if she really thought that then her moral compass is severely messed up and she’s being a hypocrite for judging me.

It got to a point where she said that she was blocking me because she wanted the conversation over.

I pointed out that she’s blocking her only daughter because I disagree with her and by doing so is acting hypocritical.

About 15 mins go by she sends “Dumb ass, I didn’t block you, I blocked this message.” She then goes on to say that what I was saying was toxic.

I point out again that she’s being a hypocrite by judging my opinions and me calling her out as hypocrite as being toxic is a judgement. She’s willing to judge me, bc I don’t agree with her but she’s unwilling to judge her son’s actions of destroying someone’s life as toxic. 

I again point out that her moral compass and mine are not aligned and that worries me. I cannot trust cheaters nor hypocrites to do what’s best when it’s not in their own interest.

Over the last three years we have mended our relationship from the point of me talking to her for three years prior for her not respecting my boundaries. I feel like she’s pushing me to the edge again.

I asked her, how much she've spent, how much she still has, etc. And she couldn't respond.

So I said that I will cover the Airbnb so she can get back on her feet for the following month.

Tho, Today she said that she is short again.... So I ask her why. And after some questionning, she confessed that she spent money on mobile games. So I said that if you have money to spend on mobile game, then you have money to spend on vacations. So I ask her to reimburse me the Airbnb.

Fast forward one week, and I went to visit Elise. This is when shit hits the fan. Initially it was just going to be the two of us, but Jason unexpectedly came home early from work. He saw us looking at the baby clothes Elise had used to surprise him, and mentioned that he wished he'd gotten home a little earlier so he could have seen my reaction to being told about the pregnancy. I just laughed and informed him that I wasn't just finding out about it, and that I was actually on the phone with Elise while she took her test. Jason went quiet and had a confused look on his face. Then he just said that Elise had told him that he was the first person to find out. I told him that he definitely wasn't first because I was, but maybe Elise could confirm whether he was second after me.

I don't agree that it should have been obvious, and I also don't see why me being the first one to find out is such a bad thing.

14,1fye2n0,AITA For telling my parents that they’re overzealous and they need to teach my precious half-sister to mind her own business?,"(Throwaway so my family doesn’t see)



(This is about me and my “half-sister Maddie” who is 14). Maddie constantly instigates social dramas at her school and then cries wolf if people stand up to her. My parents are the main part of the problem. They feed into Maddie’s antics completely, and always push the narrative that it’s all somebody else’s fault.



The latest claim from Maddie was that a girl “Nora” was harassing her and calling her ugly/bullying her for body in the locker rooms. Obviously, my parents came to the school guns blazing and revving to get Nora expelled for what she did to precious Maddie.



The school was prepared for this meeting and had two other girls there who were both witnesses to the incident. My parents parroted Maddie’s story about Nora bullying and harassing her, and both the girls who were witnesses explained that wasn’t what happened.



The girls both said Maddie accused Nora of checking her out. Nora just said that she wasn’t checking Maddie out or attracted to Maddie at all and to leave her alone. Nora only spoke in self-defense of herself after Maddie went up to her first and didn’t say anything else to Maddie.



If I were our parents, would have apologized for what happened, made Maddie apologize, then grounded Maddie for being a liar and instigator in the first place. Nope. Now my parents claim it was still bullying and are bluffing about wanting to sue the school for not defending Maddie, punishing Nora, and disciplining the two witnesses for not ""intervening.""



My “Uncle Daniel” is a paralegal and currently in law school. On Sunday, my parents told me to text Uncle Daniel and ask why he’s not responding to them because he has the connections to help them sue the school.



I got fed up and told my parents that Uncle Daniel’s probably ignoring them because this situation is just so stupid. I also said that instead of being overzealous and fighting with the school, they should tell precious Maddie to just mind her own business. I guarantee that most of her social dramas will go away if she does that.



I got grounded and had my phone confiscated for being disrespectful. So now I’m writing this on a school computer. My parents said I was acting like a brat and a 16-year-old who’s never paid bills has no place to dictate what they do.



In my opinion, that’s true to an extent. But if Uncle Daniel and our other relatives won’t tell them, they need to hear from somebody else that suing the school is a dumb idea and Maddie should quit being an instigator. AITA?

If I were our parents, would have apologized for what happened, made Maddie apologize, then grounded Maddie for being a liar and instigator in the first place. Nope. Now my parents claim it was still bullying and are bluffing about wanting to sue the school for not defending Maddie, punishing Nora, and disciplining the two witnesses for not ""intervening.""



My “Uncle Daniel” is a paralegal and currently in law school. On Sunday, my parents told me to text Uncle Daniel and ask why he’s not responding to them because he has the connections to help them sue the school.



I got fed up and told my parents that Uncle Daniel’s probably ignoring them because this situation is just so stupid. I also said that instead of being overzealous and fighting with the school, they should tell precious Maddie to just mind her own business. I guarantee that most of her social dramas will go away if she does that.



I got grounded and had my phone confiscated for being disrespectful. So now I’m writing this on a school computer. My parents said I was acting like a brat and a 16-year-old who’s never paid bills has no place to dictate what they do.



In my opinion, that’s true to an extent. But if Uncle Daniel and our other relatives won’t tell them, they need to hear from somebody else that suing the school is a dumb idea and Maddie should quit being an instigator. AITA?

15,1fydhra,AITA for telling my cousin not to call my parents mom/dad?,"My cousin recently passed away, leaving behind her son (James, 13). My cousin wasn't... a great human being. She married rich and almost immediately lost her mind. She got into the drugs that eventually killed her and spoiled her son to a genuinely unbelievable point.

Now let me make this clear - I like James. For a kid with his background, he's turned out remarkably well. He's nice in a very etiquette-bound way and has been very unassuming since we took him in, which is why I feel like such an ass for this.

A few days ago, James called my mother 'mom'. He did the same to my dad later that night. He just slipped it into the conversation, and I think everyone was hoping that the lack of reaction would be enough to tell him to knock it off. But it wasn't. Since then, he's used it increasingly - just a few times a day, but it always seems painfully awkward. My parents have both admitted to me that they don't feel comfortable with it at all, but they're trying to support him and he's already lost basically everything about his life so they don't want to cause more drama.

Yesterday, I pulled James aside and told him gently that he really shouldn't be calling them his parents - they're his aunt and uncle. He's a teenager, he had parents (however iffy) and this is more a guardianship than an adoption. We're all happy to care for him, but he's not their *son.* He's pretty hard to read, but I think he started to tear up and now I feel really guilty. At the same time, my family is allowed to have boundaries (something James needs more practice with), and it's better to nip this in the bud now than let him build up a fantasy in his head.",Asshole,2024-10-07,"AITA for telling my cousin not to call my parents mom/dad?

18,1fycwoa,WIBTA for forcibly changing my children's visitation time with their dad?,"My son (16) asked me to change he and his sister's visitation time with their dad from the weekend to Friday to Saturday. He said it's because their dad takes them to church every Sunday and he and his sister (14)  hate it. This isn't the first time they've complained about that church. It's an evangelical one, and what I've heard, the church is extremely bigoted and hateful. They're especially hateful towards women, Muslims, and gay people. So obviously my children are miserable there. Sometimes it gets so bad that my son calls me and cries over how much he hates it. His sister doesn't talk about it as much, but she tells me it's boring and she's rather not go. They tried telling their dad this, but he insists church is supposed to hurt and continued to take them.

I'm not here to debate the importance of church, but as a parent, I don't want my children going to a place that makes them this upset. They used to be so excited about visiting their dad, but now they dread it. Sometimes my son tells me to tell my dad that he's sick so he doesn't have to go. I've spoken to their dad about it and he refuses to listen. I empathize how much it's impacting their mental health but he simply doesn't care. Also, an incident happened at the church not too long ago that seriously upset my daughter. So much so that she hasn't spoken to her dad in a week. I won't go into detail but this was the final nail in the coffin. 

One day my children's case worker told us that we could change their visitation time to where their dad can't take them to church anymore. We talked about it for a while and we settled on 4 PM on Friday to 8 PM on Saturday. I asked their father if he'd be okay with this and he immediately knew why we wanted this change. I told them that the kids are teenagers now have lives of their own. He wasn't on board. At all. He accused me of trying to brainwash our kids. I told him I have no problem petitioning this, forcing him to go along with it. Our conversation ended there. I didn't tell him the kids were the ones who requested this because I don't want their dad becoming upset with them. I'd rather him lecture me than them. 

I feel like the asshole because their dad already doesn't see them as much as a parent should. It wasn't up to me. We split up when the kids were in elementary school and the visitation time was set up for us by the court. I really don't want to exclude him from their lives any further. He also told me that church has helped a ton with his depression and that he's glad the kids were there with him. I'd hate to take that away from him. I also don't want to be an over controlling parent. I feel like by doing this, I am changing a big part of my children's lives over something I don't agree with.

19,1fyc3pg,AITA for telling my roommate he needs to move out because of his emotional support dog?,"I (26M) have been living with my roommate , let’s just call him ""Jake"" (27M), for about two years. We’ve always gotten along well, and he’s been a decent roommate until recently. Jake has struggled with anxiety for a while, and earlier this year, he got an emotional support dog, a small terrier mix. I was fine with it at first, even though I’m not a dog person, because I wanted to be supportive.

The issue is that this dog has turned my life upside down. It barks constantly when Jake isn’t home, chews on furniture, and has accidents all over the place. I’ve tried talking to Jake about it, and he’s always apologetic, but nothing really changes. I’ve suggested dog training or even hiring a dog walker, but Jake claims he can’t afford it.

It’s gotten to the point where I dread coming home because I know I’ll be dealing with the dog’s mess and noise. I work long hours and really value my peace and quiet when I’m off, but that’s impossible now. A couple of weeks ago, I gave Jake an ultimatum: either the dog goes, or he has to find a new place. Jake got really upset and said the dog is essential for his mental health, which I understand, but I didn’t sign up to live with a poorly behaved dog.

Since then, our relationship has been super tense. He’s calling me heartless and says I’m punishing him for needing support. Some of our mutual friends agree with him, saying I should be more understanding since it’s a mental health issue, but I feel like I’m sacrificing my own well-being here.

20,1fybtsl,AITA for not having my dad give me away?,"
My (29f) dad (59M) & I don't have a great relationship. My parents split by the time I was & I don't remember them ever together. I have many full bio sisters and step siblings (from my dad's remarriage). I happen to be the youngest.
Now by the time I was about 10ish my dad had stopped making trips to visit me & spend time with just me. I remember as a 6-8 year old asking for time for myself, my sisters & my dad. I even had a plan. Dad and us go to one movie, step mom and her kids go to a different movie & then we all go to dinner together this was rejected because he couldn't do that to his partner. Dad used to call all the time when I was small but really close to bed time & with no new info. It was always ""so what's new?"" This question would be asked 10 & then I'd go to bed. I told him to stop calling so late I was always staying up to talk to him. He stopped calling.
When I was 17 I advised him I was on meds for my mental health & he said ""what do you have to be depressed about?""  I said our relationship, ending up screaming at him over the phone. My parents (mom and step dad) could hear & were worried about me. When I was 18 or 19 we got in a bigger spat where I told him he wasn't there for me and our relationship was crap. He decided to sic his sister on me. She told me I had no right to speak to my father like that, no right to feel how I felt. I have gone NC with most of that side of the family.
I talk to my father once a year on my birthday, his wife writes in a card & writes a cheque telling me to visit and they love me. I always respond & thank them.
I have strained relationships with all my sisters, no relationship with step siblings & step mom.
Well now I'm getting married. I love my family and wish that they'd put aside arguments & show they care about me once in my life. I have invited all bio sisters minus 1 who didn't respond when I told her of my upcoming marriage. 
What my dad doesn't know yet is that my step dad is the man who will give me away. I'm willing to compromise & have my father walk me half way, give me to my step dad and my step dad give me to my husband. That is as far as I'm willing to go. This is also for my future husband's sake as he has only met my father once but my step dad monthly. My step mother is invited as I know my father will not join if I didn't invite her.
My step dad has been in my life since I was 6. He is amazing & has always been there for me. Every time I was upset or sick he was there, if I needed a ride home he was there. He has helped me in my career & I love him with all my heart. He is my dad. 
I told my sister that dad will not be giving me away. She was surprised & thought it would cause hurt feelings. 
For over 10 years I've had little to no contact with my dad & I think it would be presumptuous of him to assume he gets that honor while never being there for me. I admit I know he loves me but he picks his wife & step children over everyone no matter what & I won't stand for it.

22,1fybn6a,AITA for wanting to live with my GF without having her sister live with us? ,"My GF (late twenties) and I (mid thirties) have been together a little over a year. We live together in Austin, TX. About 8 months ago we moved her younger sister (21yrs old) in with us to help her escape from an abusive relationship. It was the right thing to do and I did so happily. The plan was to give her a free place to live so she can her pay off her debt, put her back on her feet, rehabilitate her somewhat, get her a job, etc. We forecasted this would take about a year and then we would send her back out into the world. This was ok with me and I was 100% onboard. 

My GF just recently came in a lump some of money and wants to buy a house after the lease is up next year. We currently rent. Very recently, she told me she wants her sister to move into the new house with us for financial reasons. Essentially to keep her as a roommate for the foreseeable future, because the city we live in is pricey. This made me upset, as I felt like the deal had been altered and that this was just the plan now, as she has already asked her to come live with us again. My GF also wants me to marry her with an intense fervor, and talks about it constantly. Ive told her on several occasions these comments and the pressure makes me uncomfortable, because I was engaged only a few years ago (7 yr relationship) and my current GF and I have only been together for a year and change. I am not ready to take that next step. It is far too soon imo. 

So here we are. The precedent has been set, my GF wants the promise of marriage and the security blanket of a ring on her finger and home ownership, and then she will she ask her sister to move out so we can finally have an private, adult relationship. Until then, I am basically stuck with a package deal I never agreed to and I am screaming on the inside. Everything inside of me is telling me this is a bad deal and that I'm being somewhat manipulated. 

Now, her sister is a decent roommate. She cleans and wants to do right by us, but she can be annoying, abrasive, and loud. She grew up neglected and under educated and it shows in her behavior, mannerisms, and the way she communicates. She can be exhausting to be around. Not to mention she brought her dog, which I essentially take care of on a day to day because I work from home most days. She doesn't have a car yet and third wheels it with us on many occasions. Holidays and functions at my parent's house, concerts, etc, she will come with us. Many of our decision about where we go, when, and how are based around her sister. This whole situation has begun to bother me and my GF knows it. I feel as if my concerns and feelings about this are not as important, that the financial incentive for her to stay is greater and benefits us more, and that I need to continue to give and just adapt to the situation. I feel like what I want could be putting everyone in a bind: kick her sister out, opt out of the extra money for the new mortgage, and my GF resents me for making her sister leave, setting us up for a really **healthy** marriage, OR I move out, everything falls apart, which will cause her to resent her sister for ruing her relationship. Damned if you do, damned if you dont kind of situation... This is a critical point for me and my GF..

AITA for wanting to live with my GF without having her sister live us? ",TL;DR,2024-10-07,"AITA for wanting to live with my GF without having her sister live with us?  My GF (late twenties) and I (mid thirties) have been together a little over a year. We live together in Austin, TX. About 8 months ago we moved her younger sister (21yrs old) in with us to help her escape from an abusive relationship. It was the right thing to do and I did so happily. The plan was to give her a free place to live so she can her pay off her debt, put her back on her feet, rehabilitate her somewhat, get her a job, etc. We forecasted this would take about a year and then we would send her back out into the world. This was ok with me and I was 100% onboard. 

My GF just recently came in a lump some of money and wants to buy a house after the lease is up next year. We currently rent. Very recently, she told me she wants her sister to move into the new house with us for financial reasons. Essentially to keep her as a roommate for the foreseeable future, because the city we live in is pricey. This made me upset, as I felt like the deal had been altered and that this was just the plan now, as she has already asked her to come live with us again. My GF also wants me to marry her with an intense fervor, and talks about it constantly. Ive told her on several occasions these comments and the pressure makes me uncomfortable, because I was engaged only a few years ago (7 yr relationship) and my current GF and I have only been together for a year and change. I am not ready to take that next step. It is far too soon imo. 

So here we are. The precedent has been set, my GF wants the promise of marriage and the security blanket of a ring on her finger and home ownership, and then she will she ask her sister to move out so we can finally have an private, adult relationship. Until then, I am basically stuck with a package deal I never agreed to and I am screaming on the inside.

24,1fybinw,AITA for not refusing to go to Hawaii with family?,"EDIT: I did not mean to say the “not” in front of the word “refusing” in the title so excuse that typo.

So, I (24F) have asked about this before, but this issue keeps going on and on about once a year, so sorry for being annoying. 

A bit of background. Most of us know that Hawaii is one of the dream places to go on vacation. You get to spend time enjoying the tropical, beachy paradise in the summer, playing music on the ukulele, going out on a luau, etc. 

Well, for me, it might not be my #1 place to go vacation, but it is a very special place to even put your feet on. that being said, there are two vacation places that I need to be perfect (even though that can never be the case but at least near perfect): Paris and Hawaii.

Now back to my AITA question: every year, my big family yarns to go to Hawaii together. A part of my huge family (my uncle and his family), have gone a few times and they obviously enjoyed it. now my cousin is graduating spring 2025 and she wants to go there for her gift. Then her family suggest that everyone would go. 

Everyone seems to be down on it until it came down to my family: my mother, my sister, and I. My mother, unfortunately declines due to her work and not having to deal with the family drama (the family I am talking about is my late father’s family). So it comes down to me and my sister (23F). My sister, also has the same thoughts as me, Hawaii is too good of a vacation place to have family drama. The drama includes dealing with a confrontational alcoholic uncle; having to deal with the kids in the family; balancing out everybody’s desires for vacation and trying to make it “family friendly”; the teenagers always wanting to take as many selfies for their Instagrams; the aunties trying to bring as much food as possible; and just a lot of dysfunctional family mess. So as a result, my sister and I swore inside our hearts, that either we would rather go with each other, older cousins only, or with a group of friends to avoid this.

Just this morning, my uncle called me to ask me and my sister if we wanted to go in June. My mom even tried to reason saying that I could just hang out with the older cousins, but that still did not feel enough of a compromise for us. Luckily, at the same time, my mother understands that we are grown adults, and we should be able to stand our ground. I had to take some time to talk with my sister and that we were pretty clear that we didn’t want to go. I gave my uncle the answer and he seems to be understanding of our decision. However, we felt bad and torn as usual because that can obviously hurt our family’s feelings. Personally also feel afraid that the other family members might go against us again and try to force us to go.

Initially it was just an eye sore of discarded potted plants but it's grown over the last few months to include tipped over jugs of anti-freeze, a fridge, several over sized stuffed toys and just more rubbish bags. I was completely happy to live and let live, but I've noticed a lot of brown scurrying things ducking in and out of the pile and that was my tipping point.

Anyways, the council apparently came today and issued her a notice that she has to clean up the property and allegedly it got kind of ugly on the drive.

28,1fyafuy,AITA for asking my spouse to read my fanfiction?,"Throwaway account, just in case, although he'd know this was about him probably if he read this.

I (NB, 41) write fanfiction. Yes, you can laugh, it doesn't bother me. No, it's not Supernatural - I've never actually watched that show, surprisingly. I was encouraged to write by a therapist, and fanfiction was a perfect niche. Although I don't think the therapist realised just *quite* what fanfiction tends to lean towards, spice-wise.

Eventually, I wrote a long story, over 100k words, which included a lot of autobiographical aspects of my struggles with mental illness, although told through a fictional lens. Some were things I'd never told anyone, including my spouse (M, 43). Through publishing this work, I have made some incredible friends, including someone I now consider one of my best friends, and I have worked through some traumas which I hadn't even known existed in my own mind.

I asked my spouse to read the work. We have been together for nearly 20 years, married for 10, and have two children. He has experienced much of my mental illnesses, including eight weeks in hospital. Despite this, we do not discuss it much and I feel he does not understand much of it. I know that, if he read what I wrote, he would understand a lot more. I have told him this repeatedly.

I finished publishing the work at the beginning of 2024. It is now October. He still has not read it. He has repeatedly said he would, but then he doesn't. He said he didn't want to read it on his phone, which is fair enough, so I loaded it onto my Kindle for him to read. After leaving the Kindle for him for two months, I gave up and took it back, as I had books of my own that I wanted to read on there.

He thinks I'm asking too much of him, especially as he doesn't enjoy reading. He knows the fandom and has watched the show (although I had to ask repeatedly over several years) and he said he enjoyed it. It does have 'spicy' bits, but I write so that they're skippable, which I've made very clear to him.

Although this is important to me, I realise I have mental illnesses and am not always rational. I'm also neurodivergent and don't always see things the way neurotypical people do. I'm proud of my writing, it's the first and only thing I've ever been proud of, and I'd never ask him to read anything else I've written as it's so fandom specific, but because this is basically about me and my mental illness, I thought it was different and he would care, but I genuinely don't know if I'm wrong and just interpreting it all incorrectly?

I know that everyone will just say ""talk about it"" but that's not where we are, and also not how mental illness works. It took over 100,000 words of fictional situations to do the work for me.

29,1fya9r6,AITA for refusing to sign a card with my ex’s name because she can’t make it to the birthday party?,"

I (36M) am throwing a birthday party for my 7-year-old son, Noah. My ex-wife, Sarah (34F), and I share custody, but we barely get along. Our marriage ended badly two years ago when accused me of cheating on her. I didn't, also it added insult to injury that she accused me of doing it with a 19 year old. An intern at work. The divorce was messy.

For most of our marriage, Sarah was a SAHM  Now, she’s working full-time and seems to be always “too busy.” She’s missed a lot of time with Noah over the past year, always blaming work for not being able to show up. This year, she let me know she couldn’t make it to Noah’s birthday party because of a work trip. Fine, life happens. But what really pissed me off is that she had all the time in the world to either mail a card or drop off a gift for Noah—and just didn’t. 

Today is the party snd she texts me, asking if I can sign her name on the birthday card I’m giving Noah.   She wants me to cover for her lack of effort so it looks like she’s involved when she’s not.

I told her no. I’m not comfortable lying to Noah. I said she could’ve easily mailed something herself, or at least video called Noah on his birthday. Sarah got all mad, saying I’m making it harder for her to stay involved in Noah’s life, and it's my fault she has to work. I’m not going to pretend she’s some great, present mom when she couldn’t even be bothered to plan ahead.

It was big phone agruement and she is calling me a jerk

Today is the party snd she texts me, asking if I can sign her name on the birthday card I’m giving Noah.   She wants me to cover for her lack of effort so it looks like she’s involved when she’s not.

I told her no. I’m not comfortable lying to Noah. I said she could’ve easily mailed something herself, or at least video called Noah on his birthday. Sarah got all mad, saying I’m making it harder for her to stay involved in Noah’s life, and it's my fault she has to work. I’m not going to pretend she’s some great, present mom when she couldn’t even be bothered to plan ahead.

It was big phone agruement and she is calling me a jerk

30,1fya48r,AITAH for not inviting my brother to my twins’ baptism ,"Back story a I (21f) had twin girls in June. We invited over our many family members to meet them. My brother (24m) was finalizing his house when they were born in June. We invited him over, and he agreed to the next day around 5pm. The next day rolls around and he never shows up. Hours later, at about 9pm, he messages me saying he won’t be able to make it. In August he officially moved to my area. I had talked to him again inviting him over to meet them with his wife and he never replies. Time goes by and brother and his wife make several social media posts about activities they are doing. They show trips to pumpkin patches, hunting trips, and zoo trips. Our other sibling, who we’ll call R so this doesn’t get confusing, stops by our place and informs me that our brother had been to R’s house multiple times. Our brother told R not to tell me and that he won’t meet our twins yet. 
Now to today, my twins are being baptized next month and we are getting ready to send invites. While talking to my mom I mention I won’t be sending one to brother because he hasn’t met the twins yet and has made it clear that he does not care to. My mom goes on a big rant about how I do not understand what he is going through, he is struggling financially, and I need to extend out the invite anyways. I explain that if he is struggling financially it has nothing to do with the situation, and sneaking around me is immature. I also explain that I won’t be forcing my girls to have a relationship with someone who pops in when they feel like it. My mom then called me an asshole and is telling my siblings I am as well, so AITAH? 

Update!! 
Unfortunately this update is very underwhelming. I messaged my brother and basically told him everything I was feeling. I said that he’s been in our area for about two months now and that I don’t understand why he hasn’t stopped by yet. I told him that it honestly hurt my feelings when he has talked to/ visited our other siblings but had yet to even call me back and that I’d like him to call me (I tried calling before the message) so that we could set up a date for him to come over. 6 hours later and his only reply was we’ll be over next Saturday. I messaged back is there something going on and all he said was “been busy”. So I guess we’ll see if he cancels on me again 🤷‍♀️",No A-holes here,2024-10-07,"AITAH for not inviting my brother to my twins’ baptism  Back story a I (21f) had twin girls in June.

For the dinner: it's too spicy! The sauce has ruined the flavour of the noodles. I can't eat spicy food anymore. You like to cook with a lot of spice. Your cooking style is so different from mine. He continued commenting the whole 20-30 mins of dinner.
Later for banana bread, it was still hot and I could only cut a small piece from the end. ""It's too dry!""
In the morning he said he doesn't like the way I make chocolate cake because it's way too dry, without trying it. 
He could smell that it was dry!!! 
I have made chocolate cake from the ready box mix in the past and yes they have been horribly dry but last night I made it from scratch with Roger's all purpose flour, the good cocoa....

Okay here is some back story - my Mum and now aunt met in high school and she had a pretty rough upbringing with a shitty Dad. My grandparents took her in, fed her, clothed her, and gave her a place to stay and she was raised along with my Mum. Later on down the track when my aunt separated from her husband for a while my grandparents quite elderly at the time took her in and her teen Daughter. They are family and that's just that. They stayed for years until the daughter moved in with her now husband and my aunt got back together with her own husband. 

Fast forward to January of this year and my grandfather had a fall, breaking his hip and in the end both grandparents had to go into nursing homes - seperate nursing home in fact due to their differential needs. During this time I visit both of them multiple times a week and take them to visit each other fortnightly with my mum taking them the other week. In this time not any of them have even bothered to call, text, or even send a letter! It is left to me to handle all their care and be part of their lives. My grandma often asks about them and is so hurt that none of them have barely even spoken to her. 

I just feel so burnt out and resentful, I love them, I do, I just don't like them. With it coming round to Christmas, they will expect to get my grandparents organised to visit them for Christmas Eve but I don't even want to face them. I don't think I could keep on a happy smile and be fake when I am so mad. None of them have seen them since last Christmas, they didn't even ring them on their birthdays!

For months even with different therapist she would not talk, she just sat there 


So, I (42F) have two daughters: Emma (17F) and Lucy (10F). The issue revolves around my husband, who is Emma’s stepfather. Emma’s dad passed away when she was younger, and I remarried three years ago. She and my husband don’t get along at all, and she makes it clear she dislikes him. My husband has tried to bond with her, but Emma shuts him out completely, refuses to talk, and ignores him. We all know she will never see him as a father figure and we are fine with it

Here’s where it gets tricky: when Emma was younger her bio dad would take her to  father-daughter outings. We have a lot of pictures of those, Lucy was too young to remember any of them. We thought it would be nice to do again, since Lucy does see her stepdad as her dad. Specifically they would go to a pumpkin patch and then carve them

They went to the pumpkin patch yesterday and had a great time. Lucy and my husband really bonded and had a good time.

The issue is Emma, she is pissed that he took over the tradition with lucy.  That my husband stole the tradition and I am disrespecting my late husband memory.

I was exhausted from hearing the same arguments over and over. So, I snapped and said, “Yeah, I get it, you hate him, but your sister sees him as her dad and doesn’t have these memories like you do. Are you really doing to ruin this for your sister and no one owns going to a pumpkin patch

34,1fy9m4l,AITA For telling my mother I don't like being around her when she makes a scene?,"Basically, I honest to god love my mother (59) before I go any further. She really tries her best to make things easier for me (M28) dealing with my Asperger syndrome (mild, but still need someone to help explain things)

But I'd be lying if I said my mother does not a massive temper. And one things that brings it out in her is shops,  and energy companies. Even when her reasoning for being mad are justified, she has a terrible habit of ranting off and getting very loud. Even when I'm around her, she does not hesitate to go off.

So on this occasion, should say I (thankfully) was not around her. She was at the shop that sold us our new glasses, as both of us need them. But both of our glasses have been causing us to have headaches, and in my mother's case nausea due to effecting her balance. And originally we had to pay the shop in advance for a 2nd pair that we can have done at a later date.

Today though, they tried to make her pay for the whole thing again, despite having already paid for it last time. So she (understandably) went into a rant, making a massive scene and storming out according to her.

Now, yes I was not there. But I couldn't take having to basically walk on eggshells regarding who or when she was going to go ranting at a company or shop (whether I'm there or not), so I bluntly told her that I really do not like being around her when she behaves like that.

And she went off again claiming that I was ungrateful and to piss off.

But the thing is... I am not sorry for showing my mother no sympathy regarding her behaviour. I completely understand why she goes off like that, like for the glasses I understand completely. But whenever she's behaved like that with me beside her, she's;

- Making us both the centre of attention.

- Getting very confrontational.

- Really setting off my Aspergers.

Stacy is well, like a Disney show main character come to life. It’s bad. She has no social cues and is hated by everyone that knows her minus a few odd balls like my one of my best friends Julie (17F), who adores her so I try to be civil to her.

This treatment isn’t for no reason though. She looks at all men like they’re her love interests including my 13 year old brother SIMPLY because he’s a guy. She doesn’t feel close to anyone yet calls everyone her bestie while calling one of her friends a ‘hood rat’ or be very rude and think it’s the most hilarious thing ever. She’s horrible to girls but calls herself a feminist. Her main friends are abusers, someone that looks like her touch a few kids, and other than my bestie her friends are terrible and she hates on them actively too to idfk talk to me? It’s just weird. 

She purposely puts herself in bad environments too just for validation- Hell some of this is relatable wait a minute LOLOL.

But onto the main issues of why I don’t want to invite her. 

1) She has tried to date/hook up with all of my girl friends’s brothers. She has never been in a relationship but is FWB type of situation with my other bestfriend’s brother even though she’s openly admitted to not liking him?! And I’m not trying to slut shame it’s just that I don’t think the brother knows that they are just FWB and not dating. She’s talking to at least 3 other guys rn and writes love letters to even more guys. It’s just so messy and everyone at my party has at least one bad interaction with her under their belts and I’m still pissed about her trying to ask about my brother.

2) She’s awkward asf at parties. We had Julie’s birthday party a few months ago and she was there and the rest of Julie’s party guests were uncomfortable cause Stacy would just talk about boys or make jokes that never land or repeat talking about she’d hurt one of us (in a ‘playful way’ and Julie, who is autistic and sweetest gem alive bless her, let’s just say it was like this year’s  Women’s Olympics boxing match smh either way Stacy whining. But Stacy is so….its just bad.

She reminds me a lot of myself back in middle school (THE ANXIETY AND INSECURENESS NOT THE MEN THING OR BEING RUDE TO MY GIRLS) before Covid gave me a much needed character arc at the cost of a ton of trauma. I feel like that’s a savior complex in the making and I’m scared. That doesn’t make her actions of objectification and rudeness tho.

I feel like I need to address that or tell her that she’s not invited because she went up to my friend today telling her what they should do for MY party which isn’t a surprise one and is at said friend’s house (she hates Stacy too btw but doesn’t want to tell her that smh so I can’t use that excuse).

 ""Hi, Antony! Are you going with us?"" ""No, thank you. I will better stay here and go into the pool"" 
""Ok, have fun""
 The reason why I refuse always is my autism - I hate trying something new. But Luna looked at me and decided to ""hey, let's go on balcony and talk""

""So, what's it?""
 ""Antony. Listen. You have many possibilities, right?""
 ""Uh, yeah?What are you talking about"" 
""Yes. Not many people have chance to be there""

""No, you won't""
 ""STOP PLAYING ORACUL! I WILL!"" 
""...next time you think about throwing away an opportunity, think about Robin. You are being selfish for her""

 ""He's not! If you'll decide to feed a stray cat every day and he would refuse, would you feed him in one hundred time?"" 
""Yes, I'll always will"" 
""No, you won't""
 ""STOP PLAYING ORACUL! I WILL!"" 
""...next time you think about throwing away an opportunity, think about Robin. You are being selfish for her""

Cried again

After I went to my mom and asked: 
""Mom, can I swear?""
 ""Did something happen?"" 
""Yes"" 
""Ok"" 
""Luna is fucked"" 
""What?! She is your grandma! This is taboo!""

I told her everything. she said that I should have said it to Luna and the fact that I was silent and after vented to mom makes me, in fact, selfish indeed. I cried third time 

It's been a long time. I have no remorse and would do it again

Pls tell me, AITA?

37,1fy8zoh,AITA for cutting off a fake friend and I am proud of it?,"To cut the story short, there’s this girl, let’s call her IVY (26F), I (25F) became friends with her because she’s the girlfriend of my boyfriend’s best friend. You get it, right? Honestly, we weren’t on good terms at first. Back in college, we used to throw subtle shade at each other on social media. So childish, right? Haha. But we were immature back then. Anyway, fast forward, we eventually patched things up, and I even apologized to her last year for the things I said and did (she didn’t apologize though—just me, lol). But hey, accountability is important, right?

So, we occasionally hang out with our boyfriends, including Ivy, and things were fine… until I started feeling that she was really unsupportive. While, I was making an effort to connect with her, even in small ways. I could already sense that our friendship was forced, like we were only friends because our boyfriends are best friends. It became more obvious when certain life events happened—new home, car, motorcycle, travels, you know the vibe. Suddenly, she stopped viewing my stories and reacting to my posts. She seemed down about it, and I got the sense she was disappointed that we were doing things that she and her boyfriend couldn’t. I never bragged about anything, but my gut was telling me something was off. (If you know, you know!) LOL.

It’s like she’d sulk whenevr my boyfriend and I were happy. The funny thing is, her boyfriend—who was originally our friend from college—isn’t bitter or hateful toward us at all, which is refreshing. We’re thankful for that, because despite how Ivy acts, we’ve never felt any negativity from him. So what did I do? I mentally cut her off. She doesn’t know, but I started giving back the energy she was giving me. I don’t want her around anymore. I hate her, and she’s so fake. Every time we’re together, I feel like I’m being fake too, but honestly, I just don’t give a damn about her anymore.

Most people think she’s nice or whatever, but I can see her true colors, her intentions, and her motives. Or is it just me? Why do I feel this way?! LOL. I just don’t vibe with her at all. She’s so extra and competitive—like, not even in a healthy way. Sometimes she throws shade, calling me a ‘narc’ and saying she hates being overshadowed (AYAW NASASAPAWAN). Well, guess what? ‘YOU CAN’T COMPETE WHERE YOU DON’T COMPARE.’ And honestly, when I think about it, my life is better, so I don’t even want to compare. kahit kanino. Every time I post or share about my happiness, achievements, or little wins with my boyfriend, she acts like I’m bragging. So, is that really a true friend? Everything she claims to hate in a friend, she actually embodies. Way to go, Ivy. (So hypocrite)



Oh, and I know her bad side. I’ve seen how she talks and acts when she doesn’t like someone, especially since we’ve traveled together a lot. Don’t judge me, I didn’t do anything wrong, okay? I'm just here ranting :D I just stopped talking to her and replying to her messages, which were mostly gossip about other people. In the end, she acts like she’s the victim and I am the ""Bad girl"" which is I KNOW RIGHT Hahaha. I tried bringing this up with my boyfriend, but he’s too nice for this drama, and couldn’t relate. He just gave me advice to ‘be kind.’ But, uh… I’m not nice. LOL. I’ll make you feel what you deserve to feel (but I’ll still stay in my lane).



It's tough when you're genuinely happy, content, and grateful. It's true that a lot of people, especially those close to you, will get mad about it. Jealousy doesn't choose its target, so be careful to the evil eye (which she wears ironically) HAHAHAHAA. This is your sign to cut off those unsupportive friends.

38,1fy8i7t,AITA for telling my relatives to GTFO out of the patient room?,"My mother had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer, and she had to stay there for a few weeks after the surgery. She could barely even walk, and lost a lot of energy, and some of her family members came to visit. Including her parents and siblings, and some grandkids.


When I had came in with the bedsheets all dried up from the laundry room, I could just HEAR the **very** loud noises from the stairs. The kids were running around everywhere, some playing loud sounds from their phones. They even messed around with my moms furniture we had bought for her. When I had asked about this my relatives just said that they were children and just “having fun.” 

Then, second day of arrival, they threw a fucking BIRTHDAY PARTY for one of the grandkids. Not a quiet, cutting small cake type party, literal party horns, popping balloons type of party. They used the small table on my moms bed as for the giant cake. My mother was very tired and seemed so stressed about the noise, and that’s when I got fed up with their BS. I told them to gtfo and let her rest in peace, and that their birthday party can go somewhere else. 

My grandparents and aunt/uncles refused to leave and started to complain that I was being too sensitive, and that I should learn to behave to adults, and that children should have all the freedom they want. My dad had also finally had enough and snapped at them as well, and they finally left, not even cleaning the mess they had made.

Later that day they told my mom that they felt “excluded” and “hurt” and demanded some type of apology,(one of them demanded the cake money) from our family. We refused and told them to never come to meet us again, unless THEY were going to apologize to us.

39,1fy8i3e,"AITA/WOULD I BE TA, if I stand in my ground, about keeping the dog in the bed. ","I (f25) just moved in with my boyfriend of 5 months (m28). 

A little back story: I'm lived in another country when I met my bf, I had 2 dogs and a cat. I lived in a house that I had just finished renovating. I had a big garden a library room and a hobby room. Furthermore I was supposed to start studying law this year, in my country, but decided to move instead. I have been on my own for many years, therefore compromising can be a bit hard for me. (hence this post) 
I am a smoker, and I smoke inside my house as well, both cigarettes and weed. I keep the windows open, and my house doesn't usually smell like smoke. I also spend most my time in my garden planting and enjoying nature. I have had my dog for 10 years now, and she has been my Rock through all my messy life. I dare say she is the thing in this world I hold most dear. She is a breed that usually lives to the age of 14/15 so she is nearing 

When we agreed to move in together, we agreed to move to his apartment in his country, as he didn't feel like it was possible to move to my country cause of work, and I did want to experience something different. The finish line (to my horrors). 

Now to the problem! 

I completely understand that he does not want me to smoke in the house (fair) so I go out, it's a big difference for me, but I get it and accept it.

I gave away one of my dogs, cause it was stressed and made a lot of noice. It hurts still, but the dog is much happier now, as I couldn't give it what he needed. I accepted it.

We also agreed that a new place with a garden would be too expecive for the next few years, so I accepted that as well cause he wants us to save up money. 

Then the cat couldn't be in the bedroom cause it moved around too much, I accepted that, as she did make noice and I saw it disturbed my bf sleep. 

However, now he says he does not want the dog in the bed either, cause of the hairs, and he thinks it's a private place. I understand where he is coming from. As it probably is very boundary crossing to sleep with an animal when I never had one before. But on this I just don't feel good compromising. I know my dog, she would be miserable, and it would take time to train as she Is an old dog. And I know it sound ridiculous, but she has a aways been there for me, so I don't want her to live her last years as anything less than perfect. It's at the point where I think it will be a deal breaker.  Because what is the point of me moving in with him, if I can't do and live the way I feel good, I feel like I compromised a lot in this relationship, gave up a superior house, my hobby garden, education and a dog. I feel like he should just accept the dog in the bed. I feel my a stomach getting nervous thinking about just leaving her all night.

40,1fy8drj,AITA for telling my girlfriend that I didn't want her friend to sleep at our house?,"I (20f) have been living with my girlfriend (21f) for a year. She is friends with a girl that I'll call Avery (20f). Next weekend they're all going to a friend's birthday party, but since Avery lives pretty far from the party my girlfriend told her she could sleep at our house. 

I didn't know about this, and only found out because I heard Avery asking my girlfriend for our address and say that it was nice of her to offer. I asked my girlfriend about it and she explained why she offered that. 

Here's why I have a problem with it. A few years ago, a friend of mine, for similar reasons, didn't have a place to sleep for the night so I invited her to my house. We had met two months before and got along well, but I didn't know her that well. While I was sleeping, she stole my computer and some stuff around the house and left. I never saw her again. Because of that, I don't want to let people in my house unless it's friends that I've known for a very long time and trust. My girlfriend knows that. 

Next weekend, I'm going back home to see my family, so I wouldn't even be in my house, which makes it worse for me. My girlfriend got a bit mad at me for insinuating that her friend is a thief and assured me that she trusted her, but I told her that they've only been friends for a few months, and I trusted my other friend too. She's getting a bit pissed at me for making a big deal out of it and told me that Avery would sleep at our house whether I liked it or not, and that I wouldn't even be here so she didn't understand what my problem was. 

I know it's ridiculous, and I'm not saying that Avery is a thief or that anything bad is going to happen because I know it's highly unlikely, but when you've experienced something like that it's normal to worry. What my girlfriend doesn't understand is I can't do anything about it. I worry, and I really *can't* let someone sleep at my house, it's not that I don't want to. She told me to ""just get over it and stop being paranoid"". I know I'm being difficult but I truly can't help it.

He had to take my stepsiblings (13f, 11m) with us. He's not their step-uncle btw. He's my mom's brother. Stepsiblings are my dad's stepkids. But my uncle and dad used to be best friends but their friendship ended when my mom died 7 years ago. Things are messy because my uncle still wants to see me and I want to see him but dad doesn't want my stepsiblings left out so they get dragged around sometimes.

Something kinda relevant is that my stepsiblings have (not-anaphylactic kind) food allergies. Their allergies are different from each other and they get rashes and puking and stuff from eating foods they're allergic to.

I told him they shouldn't have been there in the first place. I didn't want them there. He was just fucking with my uncle. His wife heard me say her kids shouldn't have been there and she asked where my compassion is and where my sibling bond went and I told her I never had one.

My roommates, of those 5 years, moved out in august and I had 2 new roommates move in . One of them has been my friends for 20 years . She asked if her friend could also move in (this will be her friends first time moving out of her families home) . I said it was fine as we have 3 bedrooms. My boyfriend had been “living”with me for a year, he is here 5 out of 7 nights of the week. When we are here we keep to ourselves, usually just in our room. We try not to occupy common areas in the house so everyone is able to enjoy them. My friend who I originally asked to move in, was fully aware of my living situation prior , as she was also here a few times a week hanging out with us. 3 weeks ago my 2 new roommates pulled me aside to talk about my boyfriends time spent here. During this conversation my friend said nothing during this conversation and it was her friend doing all the talking. She started the conversation with “your boyfriend is here a lot, like a lot, all the time”I sat there trying to separate my emotions and let her talk. She made another comment on how he does not pay rent ,which is 100% valid, so I can see how that can be frustrating, and saying the situation could be different if the rent was split for 4 people living at the house. He offers money for utilities every month , but I decline them because I have the miss independent shoe up my ass. I told her he is more than willing to pay if that will make the situation better for her. it quickly turned into her being uncomfortable with him here so often. Not giving a reason of being specific as to why she is uncomfortable. The conversation ended with no solution just her saying “I hope you’re not mad”
I gave myself the rest of the night to process and try to find a solution to present to my roommates to make everyone happy but was still feeling confused because it started with financials then to comfortability. I ended up texted both the roommates asking for more clarification. I only received texts back from the one roommate, I asked what a good solution would be for the both of them, saying I needed a better understanding after our conversation. I mentioned if it was rent we can figure out a way to split the rent/utilities to make it more fair, but if it was something that was making them uncomfortable they needed to be more clear. There are 2 days during the week where he is at the house while I’m working. I asked them if they are uncomfortable with him at the house in general, when I’m not there , certain nights? She said it has nothing to do with the rent ,she’s not uncomfortable with him as a person just the time spent at the apartment. I asked if having him to leave the 2 days I was not there would be sufficient. essentially she said “we can start there”

44,1fy7002,AITA? Fiance thinks the apartment is haunted. I think she needs therapy ,"My fiance Lynn and I (both 28) have been together for 5 years now. We are in a great relationship, so I can't really complain much about a lot. In terms of personalities, we get along good. Have many similarities and also many differences. 

For one, Im atheist and I don't believe in anything supernatural. Or spiritual. Lynn on the other hand is very spiritual and believes in the ""other side"" and has told me accounts of supernatural things that have happened throughout her life. 

Well fast forward to now, and this whole issue, we moved into a new apartment last year together and it's caused nothing but constant stress for her. And now me. The people in the apartment building are pretty nice, but I do admit everybody there is a little strange. They all go into each other's apartments, have keys, hang out together. There are 6 units here. 

This apartment was made in the 1800s so it's an old Victorian house. No doubt it has history, but the stuff that's happened has been weird. But I don't believe it's due to supernatural things. I think it all can be explained. 

Lynn seems to think it can't be explained since all of these issues seem to happen and stop all at once. 

When ""there's a presence"" in the apartment, some weird things do all happen and it does stop when said spirit leaves. 

- The first time this all happened was a month after we moved in. The issue seems to be in the kitchen. Our cat peed in the kitchen in the middle of the floor which she never does, and never wants to go in the kitchen. 

- The broom in between the fridge and wall would fall over randomly when there was nobody there. This is what happened the most. 

- Shampoo bottles fell off the shower. I thought maybe a neighbor did it by slamming the door, but nobody was home the day I personally witnessed it. 

- As this is happening, the fire alarm went off at 1-3 am. As we got up out of bed to turn it off, it immediately stopped. I replaced the battery. Cleaned dust. Tested for carbon monoxide with our separate alarm. Nothing. 

When this all happens, we both seem to wake up in the middle of the night for no reason. Then this all stops and nothing ever falls. The alarm never goes back on. And there are no weird noises. 

Until it comes back. I told her that it's all just an old house and things fall. The fridge is a little older, so maybe we don't close it all the way. There's explanations for everything. 

The other day, these things all happened again. While she was in the shower, the picture frame we have in the bathroom fell and shattered and that's what did it for her. 

She was telling me She wants to leave, she's paranoid. But I told her she needs to seek help for her paranoia with this, because it's starting to be too much. We cannot just leave now.

 My friend's parents just bought her a house CASH (good for her and I have no problem with that), and she's been reaching out how she wants to give me ""advice"" with financial budget on buying a home. I never asked for this advice. The thing is, she believes she can afford a 400k (2% property tax in this State) on her 76k salary even though her parents bought her the house. I guess she's paying them back with 0% interest rate(?). The thing is she told me her parents bought her this house. 

I've given her a few clues that we are not there yet, that my husband and I will have to do the research (school district, what the new offer would be, debt/paycheck ratio and etc) and once things finalize on our end, we will pull the plug on buying. But TODAY, I lost it. She kept pushing what my budget is, how I can play around with numbers on her spreadsheet.... If she can afford a 400k house then I ""can"".

52,1fy6717,"AITA for turning down a ""more convenient"" job offer?","I (33f) am a teacher. I teach mostly elementary school students, but the school that I work for at the moment also allows me to sub for middle and high school students, because all three levels are handled by the same group. I also have to state that it's a private school. 

The school that I work at is a 45min drive away from where I leave. Most mornings I don't really see my family and leave before my children are up. I have two children, they are 4 and 6. Both of them go to a school that's not even 5 minutes away from our house. My husband brings them to school every day, which is also rather convenient, because he drives past the school on his way to work. Twice a week, the kids stay at the school a bit longer so that I can pick them up on my way home, and the other days my husband picks them up.

Recently, I was offered a job at the school my kids go to. The position was nice, and since it's also a private school, the salary was great, but similar to what I'm already making. I considered taking it, but eventually turned it down. Before turning it down, I had mentioned it to my husband a few times and he thought it could be nice, but never actually told me to take it. When I told him I didn't take it, he got pretty angry which I didn't understand. 

He told me that I should've taken the job because the salary was better, and that way he wouldn't have to bring the kids to school or go get them everyday. While I understand that it could've been more practical, there are a few reasons why I didn't take the job. First, because the new job position didn't give me the same opportunities to, on occasion, teach middle or high school level, which is a great experience for me and a part that I really love about my job. 

I also didn't take it is because I didn't want to live near where I work. Before we had kids, we used to live in a different city and I was 5 minutes away from the school I worked at. The problem is, I would very often see parents, when I was out grocery shopping, at the park, in my yoga classes, in the street etc. While it can sometimes be nice to chat with the parents, a lot of the time it's not. They always try to talk to me about their kids, about why they think he should be moved to a higher grade, why he shouldn't be given homework, or they try to tell me what I should teach. I try to separate my private life and my job, but for that reason it's not always easy, and that bothers me. When we moved, I made sure to work far enough from my house that I wouldn't have to deal with that. 

He doesn't understand and keeps calling me selfish. He said that I wasn't providing to my family like I should because I didn't take the higher salary. I won't go into details because this is already a long story, but the salary is actually not really higher. He also said that I was treating him like my personal nanny because I forced him to take the kids to school every day. I don't necessarily feel like I'm in the wrong but I don't know.

53,1fy5oqy,AITA for complaining to a friend about going to my half brother's wedding?,"My mom heard me talking to my friend on the phone Saturday about how much I (16f) was hating the idea of going to my half brother's (25m) wedding. My mom waited until I was done and she told me how hurtful it was to hear me say I'd rather spend the night in the park, alone, in the rain. Or that I hoped the wedding would end super fast so I could be done early. I also described it as feeling like a punishment. But I also told her that I knew my sister (14f) and brother (13m) and I would be left awkwardly out and have a bunch of questions about who we are because my half siblings don't like us or talk about us or include us in their lives so it would be all kinds of crazy.

My mom was upset with me for talking so openly about all the issues we have as a not 100% bio family. But she said it hurt to hear I'd prefer not to go and that I could talk so negatively about it.

Oh, btw, my siblings and I weren't invited willingly. My mom's name was on the invite and she was given a plus one because my dad (half brother's stepdad) would never be mentioned on the invite. But neither were ours. Mom had called and asked/told my brother she assumed we were all included under that plus one. His reply? *If you really have to bring them.* Doesn't that say exactly how much he wants us there?

But yeah, my half siblings dad was never around. He could be dead for all they know. He walked out. Mom married my dad and had us. But they never liked dad or us. And dad tried really hard. He still does. He loves them and says he has five kids instead of three. But they don't return those feelings. When I was younger I really loved and looked up to my half siblings but I'm not a sucker for punishment so I eventually stopped caring. Like they said, they only have one sibling. So I only have two, my younger siblings. I don't remember the last time I actually saw either of them. I never my my brother's fiancée but she knows we exist and I heard her and mom talking a few times.

Anyway... my mom lectured me about talking so openly about how much I hate this wedding and how it's an exciting time for the family. She told me she knows things aren't easy but we're still a family and who knows what the future can hold. She said we need to try and stay open to it.

55,1fy5366,AITA For telling my girlfriend she doesn’t love me even though she tells me she does?,"It’s been 2 and a half years since we started dating, and while we’ve generally communicated well about our feelings, I’ve developed serious doubts about her love for me over the past 6 months. We’re both 18, so this may sound cringey.

At the beginning, she struggled with depression, but she told me I helped alleviate her stress and anxiety. She was very affectionate, and we often called each other, sharing words of affirmation. She also supported me through my body dysmorphia, though her encouragement sometimes led me to neglect my appearance. I believed our love was genuine since it was my first relationship.

However, her anxiety resurfaced about a year ago due to school stress, leading her to start depression medication, which affected her affection for me. We used to be “active”together often, but now our “active” moments have drastically decreased to once every few months. I attributed this to her medication, but other signs have raised my concerns.

Despite my consistent affection and efforts to plan our time together, her engagement has diminished significantly. When we’re apart, it feels more like friendship than a romantic relationship. Calls which used to occur nearly every night now occur rarely, and she often forgets or delays making plans when I ask her to, since i am the one always making them. The love and attention she once showed seem to have faded. I want to believe this is due to the medication, but it’s been 7 months with no improvement.

I’ve voiced my concerns to her, and while she apologizes and promises to improve, nothing changes. Her depression worsens, and when I offer help, she seems apologises and promises to do better but nothing ever comes out of it. I want her to be happy, but it’s painful to watch her struggle without taking the steps to improve her situation.

I can’t imagine how hard this is for her, as I’ve never experienced such depression, and I’m worried that my overthinking might add to her pain. The reason im asking this sub is because i want to know if I am justified in my concerns, or if im being insensitive?

57,1fy4g6o,AITA Family Picture Drama,"My wife is an amateur photographer/perfectionist and for 15  years I’ve known she has had a very different approach to taking pictures than me.  I take lots of quick pictures capturing candid moments and the occasional group shot, she feels a need to pose people and micromanage lighting, faces, positioning, etc to get ""the perfect picture"". This has gotten more and more challenging as we've gotten older and had kids and dogs.

Recently we had a rehash of a fight we've had multiple times. We went to a pumpkin patch with our 3 kids (ages 1.5, 6, & 8) and not long after getting out in the patch she set to work setting up a family picture. She spent about 15 minutes futzing with settings on her extremely expensive (\~$3k) camera and tripod while I followed all three kids around and then she called us back to pose and we spent another 15 minutes trying to get a good shot. The sun was beating down and everyone was sweating and uncomfortable standing there, the kids were squirming and complaining, and camera remote control was malfunctioning, and everyone got pissy and while she took many pictures she basically gave up on getting ""the shot"" and was angry at everyone for the rest of the morning. By the time it was done, one kid had to pee and another was hungry and wanted to sit in the shade and have a snack. By the time all kids issues were settled they wanted to play on the playground, look at animals on the farm, etc. eat lunch, and then it was time to go home. We didn't actually get any pumpkins picked out LOL.

On the ride home she gave everyone a lecture about how important the pictures were for preserving memories and how angry she was at me and the kids for not being more supportive. She said she ""wouldn't have come out to the pumpkin patch if not for getting the family fall picture."" I countered that pictures are important but that the experience was most important and that I had thought we were going to patch for the benefit of the kids and that the picture was a nice bonus if we could fit it in. She didn't like that much.

This fight has happened many times. It’s rare that we set up for a nice family picture without her getting upset with everyone for not cooperating. It’s especially tough because she is both in the pictures and taking the pictures with remote control and tripods which requires a lot of back and forth between posing, picture taking, checking, adjusting, and repeating. We've hired photographers before and she doesn't like what they do, she feels like she does a better job than folks we've hired. The pictures are lovely when she gets them but I look at them and feel like they are usually a lie, fabricated moments. I try to be supportive but inside I wish she would let this go, it’s feels impractical, and she fails to prep adequately for the human element and recognize that she can't do this as well as she'd like when she is in the picture.

58,1fy4ddw,AITA for forgetting to tell my friend that i‘m giving our shared gift to the birthday girl on my own,"My best friend‘s birthday was coming up, I like to be ahead of time with stuff like this, to have everything ready on time. One of my best friend texted me like four days before our friends birthday and asked if we were planning a present together, since she is very uncreative when it comes to planning gifts. I told her I had already arranged the whole gift but that technically we could still try to arrange this gift as a present from us both. Even though I did explain that a part of my gift is very personal and written in my own name etc, which I couldn't change anymore. My budget for the gift was 25-30€, which I also ended up spending on my gift. Meaning my friend, needed to buy another present in the same price range, resulting in two separate gifts.

Time moves on and she did not reach out to me about the gift again. Our friends birthday comes around, me and birthday girl ended up being in our hometown at the same time, which is when I spontaneously decided to just give her the gift, since I wasn’t sure when I was going to see her again. I didn’t even think about that this was supposed to be a shared gift since I had a hundred other things going on in my mind and since my friend hasn’t reached out to me again, I thought she figured it out on her own and got her a gift in the meantime.

I got a text from the girl who wanted to be part of the gift a day later, saying she was confused why I gave the gift to our friend since it was supposed to be a gift from us both. I answered that I thought she just got a gift on her own since she never reached out to me again, and that it was pretty spontaneous to give her the gift now, since I wasn’t sure when I would see the birthday girl again. She said she understood that we were giving her my gift together plus buy something else from us both. I told her that „my“ part for this gift was finished for a long time and I thought she would just get „her“ part of the gift independently. I also said that after all, that if I understood correctly it would have been two gifts in the same price range, which is why it probably doesn’t make a difference whether we give her the gift at the same time or not. She said this was a really dumb situation since now she looks like she doesn’t have a gift. I apologized and said that I should’ve communicated better and I think that this was a misunderstanding. I am not someone who likes to point fingers, particularly when I am the one being „called out“ BUT I think that her not having a birthday present, knowing the birthday was coming up soon, is not my fault. I had made it pretty clear that my present was finished, therefore I felt like I was done with the gift planning etc. and don’t really understand what she was waiting for.

Time moves on and she did not reach out to me about the gift again. Our friends birthday comes around, me and birthday girl ended up being in our hometown at the same time, which is when I spontaneously decided to just give her the gift, since I wasn’t sure when I was going to see her again. I didn’t even think about that this was supposed to be a shared gift since I had a hundred other things going on in my mind and since my friend hasn’t reached out to me again, I thought she figured it out on her own and got her a gift in the meantime.

I got a text from the girl who wanted to be part of the gift a day later, saying she was confused why I gave the gift to our friend since it was supposed to be a gift from us both. I answered that I thought she just got a gift on her own since she never reached out to me again, and that it was pretty spontaneous to give her the gift now, since I wasn’t sure when I would see the birthday girl again. She said she understood that we were giving her my gift together plus buy something else from us both. I told her that „my“ part for this gift was finished for a long time and I thought she would just get „her“ part of the gift independently. I also said that after all, that if I understood correctly it would have been two gifts in the same price range, which is why it probably doesn’t make a difference whether we give her the gift at the same time or not. She said this was a really dumb situation since now she looks like she doesn’t have a gift. I apologized and said that I should’ve communicated better and I think that this was a misunderstanding. I am not someone who likes to point fingers, particularly when I am the one being „called out“ BUT I think that her not having a birthday present, knowing the birthday was coming up soon, is not my fault. I had made it pretty clear that my present was finished, therefore I felt like I was done with the gift planning etc. and don’t really understand what she was waiting for. Even if we said we would be planning a gift for our friend together, she still would’ve planned „her“ part herself.",2.0,0.9864689,1,0
59,1fy492s,WIBTA for putting my brothers girlfriend on a different table ,"I’m getting married in March next year, im happy to let my brother have a plus one but i have never met his gf and neither have any of my family members other than my mum (but all I know from that meeting is they argued and my mum isn’t happy with her) and we’re having round tables at our wedding.

It’s 12 max per table and my family will be sitting on the ‘head’ table. However with us (2) my parents (2) , grandparents (2- one form each side) , my sister and her husband (2) , brides parents (2) , brides younger brother (1) and then my brother(not married) (1) that’s already the 12 max.

He wants his girlfriend sat with him so I’ve given him the option of him sitting on a separate table to us but he himself doesn’t want that nor our families as we want to have family photos on our table. But he says it’s unfair to ask her to sit with a table of strangers since he’s the only person she knows. 
But there’s no way for me to have a 13 seater table (it’s usually 10-12 so there’s no room for a 13).

I don’t see how I can ask anyone else to sit somewhere else, how can a girl I’ve not met before sit on the head table whilst my sibling or brides sibling gets asked to sit elsewhere?

I’ve told him if he wants to bring her she has to sit on a separate table - AITA?

60,1fy40b0,WIBTA for telling my flatmate I feel uncomfortable in our communal space?,"I’m not really sure what to do, me (28M) and my flatmate (31M) have been living together for a couple of months now and for the most part it’s been great, we are best friends and like similar things, but I’ve started to run into some issues with cleanliness and overall consideration, and I don’t know how to address it without seeming rude or him becoming defensive about it which he tends to do and has done.

A little about me, I have some really bad anxiety with personal technology items and the treatment of them, it’s hard to explain but the best way I can is that I’m terrified of them breaking or becoming damaged in some way. This is relevant for later.

My flatmate doesn’t seem to have any awareness of general cleanliness or even simple housekeeping. 
E.g. he cooks food but doesn’t put the extractor fan on so the kitchen smokes up, he doesn’t use hand wash after cooking or I don’t think even after going to the bathroom as he doesn’t have any in his bathroom, he doesn’t seem to know what different cloths are used for like a microfibre cloth as he puts them with the dish sponges meaning they become spoiled and I have to buy more, he doesn’t use anti bacspray after cutting raw chicken, I’ve walked into the kitchen and the fridge and freezer doors have been left open, food is left in the sink and clothes left in the washing machine. 

I’ve mentioned a few of these things as a joke or trying to remind him or let him know how to deal with them in a friendly manner but he doesn’t seem to remember after, or even think it’s a big deal and I’m getting to my wits end having to either constantly sort all these things out or remind them about them, especially atm when my mental health has gone downhill so I’m struggling to cope with the constant need for cleaning and upkeep of my own stuff.

There’s also been the issue that I feel like my ideas and wants for our communal space have been overlooked by the fact that he either doesn’t like them, or has a lot of stuff of his own. 

These issues have made me start feeling self conscious to have any of my items in the communal space without them being handled poorly, so I’ve started feeling uncomfortable in my living space as I feel like its basically his with all his items. I have my record player in the living room which I believe has already become dented somehow and I’m not sure how.

Im not really sure what to do, I tried to mention it once when we were playing a game of monopoly and it turned into a slight argument. I asked him if he could wash his hands before we played, as Ive explained briefly before about my anxiety with cleanliness and handling and he got angry at me.

few days ago, i got my History results and i got a 76 which is an A minus. (An A solid is 80% - 89%). I initially expected an A solid since i prepared hard and studied hard for this particular subject. So when i got my results, i was disappointed. especially since all my of A's were A minuses. 

i expressed my disappointment to two of my friends. they both told me to be grateful of what i've achieved and be considerate since they got a C and a B indicating that i was not being appreciative of my high results and i should keep quiet about my so called disappointment. i told them that i was only disappointed about not hitting my target which was an A, not an A minus. i told them ""this is why i never tell u abt this"". then one of them got mad, lets call her friend A. 

few days later i found out friend A had badmouthed me behind my back. she told people that i shouldnt have complained abt my history grade since what I got was already considered 'high'. she then continued to badmouth me A WHOLEEE BUNCH that wasnt even related to the main topic. she said i always wanted to be the 'main character' and i should open my eyes to see that the world doesnt revolve around me. she also repeated my line which was ""this is why i never tell u abt this"", and said if i wanted to complain abt my grades, i shouldve complained it to the students in the higher classes (since classes were divided depending on 'intelligence'), not to them.

my thought process when hearing abt this was, was it wrong for me to be express my disappointment with my two only close friends? if not to the two of them, who else would i share my problems with? why couldnt they be supportive and cheer me up instead of thinking on the negative side? to me an A minus for history isnt considered high for a scolarship since we'll be competing with much much more smarter kids. and why did she have to badmouth me like she couldnt have said it to my face directly?

65,1fy3bvd,WIBTA if I refuse to walk with my friend?,"
Me (15F) and my good friend L (15F) walk together after school more often than not. She takes the MRT (subway) home, which is on the way to my bus stop. We usually walk together, sometimes stopping at the mall. It’s 5-10 minute walk only.

For the last few weeks, whenever I ask her if we're walking together, she says she can't as she's going out with our good friend A (15F). I always accept this without questioning. It checks out as A is v extroverted and loves to go out often.

Last Tuesday, L again couldn't walk with me, as she had something to do. I asked if she wants to walk together tomorrow, as I figured I'll have to be make plans in advance. She said that if she did, Arson will get angry with her for not going out with her. I found this v weird, and said ""Are you sure?"" L said one time she had told A a week in advance that she will be busy, but when the day came A was still angry at L. I left it at that, but I found it p weird. I know A is v nice, I find it hard to believe she would do that. But there's no reason for L to lie, so I accepted it. After that, I stopped asking L if she wants to walk together as I figured she would be going with A.

Today L texted me if I want to walk together. I was v happy and said yes. As we were walking, I said in a joking tone, ""You don't know how long I've been waiting for you to ask."" She said, ""Yeah, A is sick today."" I was like ""Oh...""

I was p disappointed, it felt she was treating me as a backup option. But I didn't say anything. After a minute, I was like ""Speaking of A, next time if I book you in advance and she wants you to cancel, could you please put your foot down, dawg?"" I said it in a half-joking tone, as I didn't want to seem confrontational, but I meant it seriously.

She said ""I don't want to.""

I said ""Huh why not?"" She was like ""I'm lazy :)"" I said ""...okay...?"" I was getting quite upset at this point, but I don't think it showed in my face. After being quiet for a minute, I said ""Is hanging out with her more important to you? Like just tell me if it is."" She said ""I don't want to walk.""

I was confused by this as it seemed unrelated to what we were talking about, so I was like what? She said ""I don't want to walk. When I go with A I can take a car."" This is because A takes Grab (my country's version of Uber) everywhere. I was like ""...okay?"" After that we didn't talk, just parted ways at the traffic light.

I'm v upset. It feels like she doesn't value spending time with me at all. Before these last few weeks she never had a problem with walking. Grabs are pretty expensive, and I don't want to have to spend money to hang out with her. It seems like now she's only treating me as a backup option, as the only reason she walked with me today is that A was sick.

Today L texted me if I want to walk together. I was v happy and said yes. As we were walking, I said in a joking tone, ""You don't know how long I've been waiting for you to ask."" She said, ""Yeah, A is sick today."" I was like ""Oh...""

I was p disappointed, it felt she was treating me as a backup option. But I didn't say anything. After a minute, I was like ""Speaking of A, next time if I book you in advance and she wants you to cancel, could you please put your foot down, dawg?"" I said it in a half-joking tone, as I didn't want to seem confrontational, but I meant it seriously.

She said ""I don't want to.""

I said ""Huh why not?"" She was like ""I'm lazy :)"" I said ""...okay...?"" I was getting quite upset at this point, but I don't think it showed in my face. After being quiet for a minute, I said ""Is hanging out with her more important to you? Like just tell me if it is."" She said ""I don't want to walk.""

I was confused by this as it seemed unrelated to what we were talking about, so I was like what? She said ""I don't want to walk. When I go with A I can take a car."" This is because A takes Grab (my country's version of Uber) everywhere. I was like ""...okay?"" After that we didn't talk, just parted ways at the traffic light.

I'm v upset. It feels like she doesn't value spending time with me at all. Before these last few weeks she never had a problem with walking. Grabs are pretty expensive, and I don't want to have to spend money to hang out with her. It seems like now she's only treating me as a backup option, as the only reason she walked with me today is that A was sick.

WIBTA if I refuse to walk with her if she asks? (Although I don't think she will). What do I do? Also we have PE tomorrow. I always partner with her but now I’m upset and don’t want to. My other close friend is sick rn.",0.0,1.0305637,1,0

It's not a conventional workplace, we all live on site. My role is to do some of the teaching, and maintain buildings and all the equipment on site. There are four of us full time on site - 3IC, me, 2IC and director. The guy in the 2IC role isn't very good at his job and the guy in the 3IC role usually ends up doing most of the work.

Previous to my being there he bullied a coworker for an entire year, and subsequently shut a coworkers hands in a book in a fit of rage. 

In my second and third year of work, I made a couple of pointed complaints to by boss (the director) and HR about specific incidents where I felt the 2IC was unsafe (it is a workplace where lives can be put at risk if things aren't done right) but nothing came of it.

Just to add to the workplace, the 3IC and 2IC can't stand each other, and the director complains about all his staff to other people, and sometimes openly bullies them about the way they work. So I think it's fair to say the workplace is a bit toxic.

We divorced 11 years ago and we share custody of the kids (50/50). My ex is remarried and she has a stepdaughter in her home the same age as our daughter. My ex and her husband have tried to make the kids close, but especially the two girls because they're the same age. This has not worked. I know from my kids time with me that they have zero closeness to her and my daughter in particular doesn't like her stepsister. From speaking to my ex about issues in the past I know her stepdaughter has trouble with other kids liking her and she gets excluded by them more frequently than she's included by others. This was something my ex wanted me to address with our kids before.

My daughter and her best friend were invited to a Halloween party. This year the kids are with me for Halloween so she asked me for permission to go. I spoke to the hosting parent and I felt like it was safe for my daughter to go under the circumstances. 

My ex discovered I have given our daughter permission to go and she was furious. She asked why I hadn't offered to take her stepdaughter to begin with because she learned I was dropping the girls off and picking them up. Then she mentioned her stepdaughter was excluded from the party and that every other kid in their grade is included. She felt that this meant our daughter should not be attending either in support of her stepsister. She tried to forbid me from allowing our daughter to go. I told her it wasn't a decision she could make. She argued that I should be encouraging a supportive sibling dynamic between the girls and that it seems like our kids only support each other and not their stepsister, who they've known for more than half their lives.

Hello, a throwaway here obviously, im M18 and i think i just experienced the most fucked up things possible in my life rn. A bit of background, i have been raised by my grandparents for the whole of my lives and they did well tbh, despite their advanced ages. Ive been told by them early on that i was given up for adoption by some distant cousin ( they didnt wanna tell who at first) and that the person doesnt wanna do anything by me. So i didnt think much of it. Besides why would i wanna do something with someone who doesnt want me? Anyways, when i reached 18 like a few weeks ago, my grandparents sat me down with my uncle (im not really super close with him) and then proceeded to tell me that he is my father. I was shocked, felt like the world was collapsing and i was disoriented. My uncle then started crying and told me the reason why he abandoned me to my grandparents is that he blamed me for the reason that his wife died. Like wtf? His wife died giving birth to me and thus he couldnt take it well through the grief and given up me to my grandparents. 

After all that, it clicked to me. Why this particular uncle always resembles me so much, or how he always avoided me or act cold to me during family functions (not that he always attended) or how my grandparents always dont speak much of him. Its just so crazy to me.

Admittedly, i couldnt hold my emotions well, i blew up at my grandparents and my “uncle” for keeping this secret from me and my uncle blaming me for the death of his wife. I ran to my room and locked myself there. My grandpa knocked several times on my room but i kept calling them not nice names, so they left me alone eventually.

Its been a few weeks now since it happened and my uncle is nowhere to be seen ( good riddance tho) but my grandma said i could have atleast understood his position and that he wanted to rekindle the father son relationship. I said hell no, but then idk what to think about anymore.

Some context: Due to several health concerns, I am currently taking a work sabbatical. Mostly to keep my current health under control while we work on getting answers.

When his mother heard about this, she began to share her opinions on how long it’s taken us and my lack of contribution. 

This has all devolved into her feeling as though I am hiding and lying to their family because I am “resisting help”. Her most recent request is a copy of my drivers license from my previous state so that she can run a background check.

I (30F) and BF(35F) had a baby boy a few months ago. We are now getting into arguments about whether or not to christen our baby.
I was christened and raised Catholic, as is pretty much everyone in Ireland. But since I was around 13 I started to realise how corrupt the Catholic church is and completely went against it. I'm now a total atheist. My family are still Catholic but after many years have realised there's no going back for me so just accepted it.

BF is Catholic. But he's not religious. He only goes to mass if someone dies he never prays. He's Catholic in name only. Like majority of people these days.
His mother is the same, yet is now deciding to put her holy hat on and insist our baby is christened and how ""she won't sleep"" until he is. 

So BF wanted to start planning a christening and I told him we weren't having one. This is something we discussed multiple times in our 7 year relationship. It was always a point of contention and we would typically change the subject once we started to get a bit too tense. But I made it clear from day one I will not subject my baby to the Catholic church. Just the thought of standing on that alter makes me want to cry.

But BF wants to do it to please his mother and ""make everyone happy"" I said it won't make me happy and he is disrespectful of my views. I tried to explain that Atheism is almost like a religion, but I don't believe in God and instead I believe in Science. I asked him ""If i was a practicing Muslim would you expect me to disregard my beliefs to please your mother?"" He said that's different because ""Muslims believe in something you don't believe in anything""  I find this deeply hurtful to disregard my feelings just to please his mother. She had he kids and christened them all, this is my baby I should be allowed to choose.

BF also said that it won't be fair on our boy when he's at school and kids are doing their communion and he's not. I've pointed out that since Ireland is becoming such a mixed culture thanks to Ukrainians, Africans etc that a lot of kids wont be doing communions and it will just be up to the parents to do it rather than a school activity.

73,1fy2005,AITA For pretending I'm not home the last few times my brother has called around.,"So, I have an older brother who I've never been super close to, on the surface, because of a 9 year age gap. But even as we have got older, and having similar interests in gaming and culinary arts, we remain apart. However, I've always felt he kind of deliberately does this. Initially, I thought he was afraid, if we became close, and then if something happened to me, he wouldn't cope. In the last ten years, I've recognised he also has very low self-esteem, and maybe doesn't think he deserves a great bond with his brother. I've had a fair bit of therapy, where he has not. We had a controlling father who died when I was 16.

Throughout our lives, he has made cutting remarks, even when I was a kid and he was an adult. He commented on how short I am, being slow to learn some console games,  never acknowledged my successes and I've had people comment that he is envious of my career as a chef. He dresses very well, has a sports car, owns a restaurant, spent thousands getting hair replacement that you can never mention. All this time, I've just seen him as vain and a bit of a prick. But over the last few weeks, it has dawned on me. I think he is an actual narcissist. And all my life, he has been using me for supply. From a early age, I fear he has been deliberately eroding my self-esteem, chipping away. Insulting my friends. Never supporting me. And being distant, as a way to message that I'm not worthy. This has caused untold hurt for me. 

We have sister who is a year younger than him, I don't know enough about their relationship, but I suspect he may have done similar things to her. The veil has really been lifted, and I feel kinda stupid if it is true. Everything is jokes for him. But there is a razor underneath.

So, I have an older brother who I've never been super close to, on the surface, because of a 9 year age gap. But even as we have got older, and having similar interests in gaming and culinary arts, we remain apart. However, I've always felt he kind of deliberately does this. Initially, I thought he was afraid, if we became close, and then if something happened to me, he wouldn't cope. In the last ten years, I've recognised he also has very low self-esteem, and maybe doesn't think he deserves a great bond with his brother. I've had a fair bit of therapy, where he has not. We had a controlling father who died when I was 16.

Throughout our lives, he has made cutting remarks, even when I was a kid and he was an adult. He commented on how short I am, being slow to learn some console games,  never acknowledged my successes and I've had people comment that he is envious of my career as a chef. He dresses very well, has a sports car, owns a restaurant, spent thousands getting hair replacement that you can never mention. All this time, I've just seen him as vain and a bit of a prick. But over the last few weeks, it has dawned on me. I think he is an actual narcissist. And all my life, he has been using me for supply. From a early age, I fear he has been deliberately eroding my self-esteem, chipping away. Insulting my friends. Never supporting me. And being distant, as a way to message that I'm not worthy. This has caused untold hurt for me. 

We have sister who is a year younger than him, I don't know enough about their relationship, but I suspect he may have done similar things to her. The veil has really been lifted, and I feel kinda stupid if it is true. Everything is jokes for him. But there is a razor underneath.

74,1fy1xrj,AITA for telling my bio-father that he doesn’t deserve to be called “dad”?,"I recently talked to my biological father for the first time in over 10 years. The last time I saw him was my seventh birthday party, and the entire time he complained to my mother that I wasn't calling him Dad. She went off on him, saying that he isn't, so no, I don't have to call him that. For clarification, when I was about a year old he stole my mother's money (she was the only one working while also being nineteen) right before he was supposed to fly out to move in with us. She cancelled his plane ticket, and after that it was inconsistent. Whenever he would call to talk to me, it always ended with him talking to my mother and trying to get back together with her. I realised rather early on that he didn't give one sh1t about me. So back to the present. I decided to try talking to him, and he started getting mad that I was calling him by his first name. (Everyone calls him by his middle name, even my mother. I did  it to annoy him purposefully because I'm spiteful). So I ""calmly"" explained to him that he cannot just not exist in my life and then expect me to cater to his every childish whim, and that he needs to grow up. My mother laughed when I told her what I said, but I feel guilty after the fact. AITA?

75,1fy1gzf,AITA for not lending my car to my brother in law? ,"My older sister (39) and her husband (35) came to visit me. I picked it them up from the airport and they were carless here. While they were visiting, my sister took my suv to see one of her friends who also lives in my city. That left me with my brother in law. We were talking normally about unimportant stuff, when he suddenly told me that he also is supposed to go see someone and asked me if he could borrow my second car, which is a new sports car. I told him that I would be more comfortable taking him or grabbing him an Uber. When I said this, he was visibly mad and offended. He said he is not going anywhere and proceeded to just use the phone while he waited for my sister.  When my sister got home she asked him why she didn’t go, and he said that I wouldn’t let him drive my car. She also got very offended, calling me selfish and disrespectful, and they left my house to stay at a hotel. 

I was confused because I thought there wasn’t anything wrong. My brother in law has gotten into a couple of car accidents, and isn’t the most mature driver. At the same time, the car is new and I just don’t feel comfortable sharing it. AITA? Should I apologize? 

Edit. Update:

Thanks everyone for the reassuring comments and suggestions. 

My sister is accusing me of always  “looking down” on her husband. She feels I am too judgmental and that I didn’t let him use my car because I don’t trust him. She says it’s not about the car, it is about always behaving like im better than him. 

For context, I once— perhaps out of place— pulled him aside during a family reunion and lectured him about the example he sets. He was drunk during her daughter’s birthday party and it really bothered me. I talked to him privately, but he made it a big deal that one time in front of everybody. Sister thinks the way I treat him is just condescending. I don’t think this is true, but I also don’t have a good poker face.  Anyway, sister is not talking to me anymore. We’ll see how that develops.

77,1fy15io,AITA for looking for emotional support from someone else's tragedy?,"I just need some clarity on something I think about often.

A couple years ago my sister's dog passed away. It was especially sad for her fiance since he had raised the dog from a puppy and his mom had also just passed away that year as well. A truly terrible year for him/them.

What happened is that I had made a needle felted little head of her fiance for christmas about a year prior when I was very into needle felting and I made the centre of this head from a ball of yarn. The dog unfortunately ate this needle felted ball. They took the dog to the vet right after he had eaten it and my sister had asked me what was inside the ball for the vet to know and I had told her it was yarn. She kept us all updated on our communal chat and we were all very supportive. I was feeling more and more dread that what was causing this was from something I gave them to put in their home. I know that when an animal eats string it can basically saw their insides, I didn't think that their dog would eat this ball. I was really hoping that the dog would be ok. He had gotten surgery and it was looking like he had a chance.

My sister informed us all via the group chat that the dog had unfortunately passed away and I BURST out crying. I had been holding onto this guilt that I was hoping would just become a scare and to be more careful who I gift with these needle felted things. My coworkers and I had luckily just finished cleaning our last place and my boss was on her way to driving me home. I told her why I was crying and asked if she could drop me off at my parents' since they live nearby me.

Let me be so clear before I continue. I NEVER mentioned that I was crying or anything to my sister. I never placed on my sister the guilt I felt- I only messaged her that I was so so sorry for her and her fiance's loss and that if she needed anything at all I was around. She had said thank you and that she was appreciative of my message and I sent her a heart emoji.

When I got to my parents' I had been crying and they asked what was wrong and I let them know how guilty I felt- I told them I know that it doesn't help the situation and that I don't think my sister blames me at all but I just felt soo bad and I just needed a bit of emotional support. My dad kind of rolled his eyes at me and was kind of mad and said that it was a dog and dogs do these things. I told him I know it was ridiculous but I couldn't help feeling guilty since if I hadn't given them that little head, the dog would still be alive, and the death was horrible. My dad then said sharply to me ""This isn't about you."" I told him I knew that, I told him I wasn't bugging my sister with my feelings but I was upset and just wanted to be around someone or some family. My sister and her fiance live just outside of town, I knew she wasn't going to be there and I had no intention of making my guilt her problem to deal with. I left for home soon after.

She mentioned having the best group of friends ever and that they’re all meeting for Super Bowl Sunday and she invited me. I was very excited and ready to form a true friendship with Suzie. 

I began getting more and more invites and got to see the drinking + bar scene for the first time. It felt good to be able to say that I was a part of that during college. However the vibes were definitely off with her whole “group.” No one was truly close to each other, everything was very shallow, no one even had conversations with each other. It felt more like a generic party group where each person had their own more important group of friends. 

Suzie began kind of latching on to me a little more, and I’ll never forget when she asked me to go get ice cream and walk with her at a park after her exam. It felt so personal and nice that I went despite it being extremely short notice at 9 pm. The entire time, Suzie didn’t ask me a single question about me. Absolutely nothing. I began noticing that even if I revealed something, she never asked a follow up. This resulted in her not knowing basic things about me like that I have an older brother, a single mom, my dad passed away, etc etc. I would ask her about her to keep the convo going and that’s it.

She would reach out to me for invites to things and to share gossip about something unrelated or talk to me about boys. It felt very weird bc it became more and more obvious that I was truly just a wall that agrees with her and that’s it. And she thoroughly enjoyed my presence every time, which was so weird bc she wouldn’t be able to answer any questions about me lol

The morning of her 22nd bday, we made a cake together all day for the party she was throwing later that evening and once again I began trying to talk about things that interest me like books I love and she simply never even tried to show interest (and we were talking for so long about a book she likes!!)

I went away to another state in the fall of 2023 to do an internship and didn’t truly keep in touch with her. I did my best to avoid her calls and stuff like that bc she would only call me to talk about boys. After coming back from my internship, I pretty much ghosted her.

She reached out a year later (now) asking to reconnect and told me she was very hurt with the way I ghosted her as she’s lost a lot of friends. I apologized and opened up about how I didn’t realize we were close bc I feel she doesnt really know much about me. The whole time we were talking she kept getting distracted by her phone and laughing at texts she was getting and then explaining the “inside joke” in those texts mid conversation with me. This annoyed me so, so, so bad.

My gf and i have been together for ten years. I love her but things changed.

We used to have dreams and goals. We dreemed about house, wedding etd. And we worked towards it.

Three years ago my gf told me she is unhappy in her workplace and i offered to support her till she finds new work, putting our plans on holt.

Yeah thats been three years ago. Since she has not been to a single interview and always talk about looking for the 'right' job.

So 100% of houshold expenses are on me, I also gave her some money to spend on herself.

At first, i did not mind. After some time, aprox. a year i did. I told her im not happy with her beying house wife without kids in small apartment. Its stupid.

She always either promises to try harder or starts to cry. So i offered to pay for therapy if she needs to. She said no.

That went for about two years. This year was very hard, company i work for went through a merger, so i lost my job, but thankfully i knew ahead. I told her its gonna be rough and i need for her to get a job and relieve me off some stress.

So while working at the old place i used my vacation days for some interviews and in the end landed a new job. All this while she did nothing even when she told me shes gonna help.

It was very stressfull time and i felt betrayed, because she did not help me like i did her.

I told her many times im unhappy from the stress. She always brushes it off with 'its gonna get better'.

So lately i got really pissed of and resentful.

My solution? Cutbacks. I cancelled her allowance, streaming services, her phone data plan. And told her no christmas.

To explain. Christmas are a big thing in her family, they decorate house, give lawish gifts, have people over.

I told her, you want to buy a dinner or gift, you pay for it.

82,1fy0iws,AITA for treating my classmates the same way they treated me.,"So, I’m a Chinese-American girl, and my classmates is a Brazilian-American boy. And we obviously don’t get along.

However, my classmate had always taken it even further when it comes to the whole problem, like making fun of me in every way. Being a girl, being an Asian (and even he called me that racist C-word multiple times), and so on.

And so, this whole things started when one of the classmates mistaken one Asian food with other Asian food. And what they said was that they had a Bánh Mì and calling it the best “Chinese sandwich ever.”

But when I corrected them by saying that Bánh Mì was Vietnamese and not Chinese, of course this Brazilian-American classmate of mine had to interjected and say (in almost exact words) “What does it matter what kind of “Asian” food it is? If it looks like Chinese food, then it’s Chinese food.”

And at first, I was peeved off but I tried to let it go. 

At least until a week later, I made a mistake about the different kinds of Latin-American food and mentioned something about this delicious Mexican chocolate ball (which apparently was Brazilian, and not Mexican, and called a “brigadeiro”), and he got mad at me over it.

And he went on this massive rant about the “Mexican” chocolate balls was actually Brazilian, and how I should learn to “culture myself on different Latinx countries,” because of something like how Mexico and Brazil don’t even speak the same language or make the same food.

And I decided to take this opportunity to get back at him, and say the same thing he said to me before: “Well, what does it matter what kind of “Latinx” food it is? If it looked like Mexican food, then it’s Mexican food.”

Well, apparently this got him angry enough that he told his mom about it. And a friend of mine told me that his mom got angry enough to actually come to the school, and complain to the teachers that I was being racist to her son.

Which probably explains why I have in-house suspension for the next two weeks when my principal called me to the office about my “racist behavior” to the Brazilian-American classmate. 

And when I tried to explain that he started it first, and he is always racist to every other classmate -including me, my teacher just told me that it was still unacceptable for me to be making discriminatory comments to him just because he had started it… 

… and that him being “poor Latinx” meant that it was even more unacceptable, simple because he was having it harder than a “well-off Asian” like me, even though my family isn’t actually that well-off. And that comment rubs me the wrong way.

But still, even though my teacher was right that I shouldn’t have gotten down to his level, I don't actually think I’m that wrong in what I did. 

And just to add, my own family doesn’t think I did anything that bad either, besides stooping down to his level. And even they think I don’t deserve to have a suspension like this.

AITA?

EDIT: Some people here have been correcting me about how “Latinx” is not a good word to use, and some even recommended that I could use “Latine” or “Latin-American” instead. 

So beside the words that was directly quoted (like how my principal who used the word “Latinx”, this Brazilian-American classmate of myself who actually called himself a “Latinx,” and well… me as well, but only because I was rephrasing what my classmate was calling himself), I’ll change the rest of my post to try to make it less offensive.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-07,"AITA for treating my classmates the same way they treated me.

83,1fy0gun,AITA for isolating myself away from my family on our holiday. ,"Some background context: 3 years ago my (18f) family found out that my Dad had cheated on my Mum but they were prepared to give it another ago until a few months later my Dad attacked my Mum and nearly me as well. He got arrested and since then I have barely texted my Dad, and if I have its usually to fight with him. 

2 years ago my Mum met this guy Alfie who also had two kids of his own (9f and 12m). Before the holiday I had only properly met and talked to him twice and his kids once and seen him a couple times in passing by whilst he has stayed over, but I still agreed to go on the holiday because I didn’t want to say no to my Mum and make her upset. Well, to put it frankly the holiday was a mess and I stayed in my room during the daytime and got dinner with my two younger siblings I was sharing a room with. I felt quite out of place when I was with the whole group because it felt like one big family which I am not really comfortable with as I miss my Dad quite a lot more than anyone in my family ( I was the child he was closes with). I also really struggle with body confidence so hate being in a swimsuit. I decided to stay in my room because I felt I would just bring the mood down. My Mum obviously got angry with me for hiding away but I just really did not feel comfortable acting like a whole big family when I’m still grieving the lost relationship between me and my Dad. I tried explaining this to her but I don’t think she understands why it still effects me as my Dad has been gone for a couple of years now, it also doesn’t help that my older sister (22f) gets on quite well with Alfie and talks to him when he comes to our house. I could start to feel myself tearing up so I just locked myself in the bathroom until she left. It got worst when my two younger siblings (13f and 10m) started staying in the room with me as they said the pool was getting boring and one of them gets sunburnt really easily. They are also not close to Alfie or his kids and avoid him as much as possible when he stays over. My mum accused me of convincing them to stay in the room but I was actually trying to encourage them to go outside with everyone else. When we got back home we just talked like it never happened and we’re speaking normally but I have still been thinking about if I was being a bit of an asshole to my Mum. Did I overreact or were my actions justified?

84,1fy08tl,AITA for telling my gf she rude?,"I got into a mini-argument with my gf recently because she commented on my haircut and says she likes it but she doesn't. I asked her to explain and she said she just doesn't like the sides as much and prefers long hair (which she's made painfully clear to me since we've been together for a year)

My problem is that she knows my hair is a sensitive subject because I'm young and have hairloss from MPB(Male Pattern Baldness), and while I am on medicine for it, it still makes me insecure and self-conscious. I recently got a haircut from a good barber that I'm happy with and I've had a lot of compliments from others but she seems to have this obsession with her preference of long hair and I don't want my hair long. I've made this clear plenty of times. 

I told her that she made me uncomfortable and insecure when she brought it up and I'd prefer her to just say nothing at all. And she proceeded to say ""well do you want me to lie to you?"" Keep in mind this is the same person who just a week ago said she really liked my haircut and now she's saying she kind of does but doesn't. I proceeded to call her rude and say she was being hurtful because if I was to comment something about her insecurities, she would react harshly and be really upset, more so than I even am at the moment.

85,1fxzv76,AITA for taking my stepson’s phone away after he got in trouble at school? ,"Throwaway account. I (M32) and my wife (F31) has a son (M13) who is my stepson. He goes to a public middle school and he does relatively well grade wise. He has some behavioral issues and we have tried some programs and some other things to help him with it. It seems to have gotten better as he aged as well but , my wife and i got an email from one of his teachers. 

In the email, she said that she was having issues with him being disruptive in class. I don’t think it’s acceptable for him to be disrespectful and disruptive during class when he’s not the same at home. He’s a pretty reserved kid around us. Now first, my wife and i talked to him, he seemed sorry and i didn’t hear anything else about him being like this. 
 
But today, my wife got another email from a different teacher with the same issue. As soon as he got home i told him to give me his phone. He didn’t like that idea, he refused it at first but eventually gave it to me. He never gets his phone taken and my wife is very easy on punishing him. I told him to go to his room to finish homework and that me and his mom would be talking to him tonight. 

As soon as my wife got home and learned i took his phone, she was furious. She said that i have no right to take that because she’s the one that pays for it. I agreed but tried to reason that he is having issues being a nuisance in school and it’s not stopping after we talked to her. She didn’t get that, she said i was being too rough on him and that im not his dad so i don’t have the right to take things from him. 

That stung. I raised that kid since he was 2 years old and stayed with her every moment. I consider that kid my child and he calls me dad because that’s what i am to him. He knows that i’m not his biological father but im his father figure. His bio dad is in prison (long story unrelated). 

After i try reasoning with my wife more she demands that i give her back the phone, i give it to her, but suggest that it doesn’t go back to him. He needs to understand his actions have consequences, and his mom is way too soft on him i believe. She calls for him and he comes from his room, and she gives his phone to him right infront of me. I asked her why and she said the same thing about me not having the right to take it from him.

She didn’t get why i didn’t want to just sit down and make him say sorry again. After he walked back to his room she looked at me and said “I hope you know you’re sleeping on the couch tonight.” She’s never made me do that. It hurt me, i love my wife and it truly hurt me to see her have so much anger against me. I’m laying on the couch right now. She’s in our room laying down with the door shut. Am i the asshole?

- we use to have weekly dinners with our friend group for months and when our friend got a partner she was welcomed in and joined the group 
Fast forward to earlier in the year the friend proposed to his partner. 
I thought I was on good terms with this friend as we had caught up weekly with everyone for months and he use to talk to me about his important/closer relationship details.
It comes around to the engagement party and I was strictly not invited however everyone else in the friendship group except me, I approached the situation trying to find a resolution to whatever issue it was as I was confused about how a week before things were good and now I’m a being the only one in the group purposely excluded.
I end up being blocked with no explanation,
My partner tried talking to him to work out what I’ve done and if things could be reconsidered as I’m important to my partner and I understand this friend is important to my partner too however my partner got no explanation and no reconsideration from the friend .
(It sucks but at the end of the day it’s my partner’s friend who’s also important to him and it’s also not my engagement so it’s not my choice if I’m not wanted)

Now the wedding is coming up and my names on the invite envelope.
I’m still blocked so nothing has been resolved,
My last contact I had sent an apology for whatever I may have done and would appreciate that if whenever they may feel ready to discuss what it may be I’d be willing to work through it with them, I had also sent them a gift hamper to congratulate them for the engagement wishing them the best.

I’m so stuck on what to do about the wedding 

If I say yes, then I’m going to feel guilty about the engagement party situation and just feeling so incredibly awkward, anxious and self conscious. Not feeling genuinely welcome and like I’m intruding there day.

Me: Okay got it, Ill be studying but if I have time Ill watch.

Best Friend (BF): You could’ve just not said that,now you made me feel bad

Me: Im not trying to make you feel bad

Me: Im sorry

BF: I don’t think you even know what you sorry for tbh, It felt like Im just crumbs on the floor

Me: I was just communicating my schedule to you, Nothing in what I said was disrespectful towards you

BF:It really rubbed me the wrong way. This is a huge moment for me, something Ive worked hard for, and it honestly felt disrespectful and dismissive to get such a lukewarm reply. Its not about you having to prioritize your time. everyone has commitments . But the way it came across was distasteful, as if this accomplishment wasn’t significant enough to warrant more consideration. Im not expecting the world to stop for me, but I do expect a bit more respect from people I consider close friends.

Me: I understand, I am also surprised you would think I ever be disrespectful or dismissive of anything you do. I been very supportive of you and everything you accomplish. Aside from mom I’m your biggest cheerleader. I’m very proud of everything you’ve accomplished. I have 2 midterms on Sunday the day of your graduation and 2 on Monday. Im sorry my reply didn’t live up to your expectations. My midterm schedule was already set, so it’s not like I can reschedule them or miss them, because just like you, I am also trying to accomplish something. Again, nothing I said I was disrespectful, I understand how it could be interpreted that way, but I was simply communicating my schedule and that it is. There’s no deeper meaning or anything else. You’re finding a problem when there isn’t one.

BF: I appreciate you taking the time to explain, and I understand you’re juggling a lot right now with your midterms. I know you’ve always been supportive, and I’m not questioning that. However, I also need you to understand that it wasn’t just about the content of your message, but how it came across in the moment.

From the start, she disapproved of him because he's not Hispanic or Catholic, he's too old, and a whole bunch of other things not worth listing. 

Mike's always been respectful to GM. But it grew from dirty looks to passive agressive comments to outright insults in Spanish in front of him. We see her 1x/2x a year, but it makes me livid. I've confronted her everytime, even my mom(GM's daughter)has told her to stop.

2ish years later at our engagement dinner, GM approached and insulted Mike, ending by saying she didnt give us her blessing. I'd had it. I pulled my parents and Mike aside. I told them I didnt want GM at our wedding. GM had been nothing but horrible to him from the start. It was clear that no matter how many times I/my mom tell her to stop, she was going to keep spitting her venom at Mike. He shouldnt have to deal with that at his own wedding/any other day for that matter. I tried to be respectful b/c of the whole ""she's family, she's our matriarch"" thing. But enough was enough. I also apologized to Mike profusely for all he'd gone through just to keep the peace. My parents supported my decision.

Now, a month after the wedding(which my family kept on the down low)my phone blows up from calls from GM. She started yelling at me in tears, asking how could I have robbed her of my wedding(I was the first of her grandkids to get married). How could I have done this to her? I told her she'd made it perfectly she didn't like Mike. If she couldn't be nice when I asked her to, how could I trust that she wouldn’t be cruel to him at our wedding? She tried defending herself, but somewhere in there said something like ""that’s how much I love you, I would’ve gone to your wedding despite you going through with it against my wishes"". That set me off. I yelled at her for the 1st time and ended it w/ saying ""Mike and I are a package deal. You disrespect him, you disrespect me. I won't tolerate it anymore. Consider me out of your life until you apologize to him"". I hung up.

Everyone has been saying that GM is a wreck. Crying nonstop and begging for me to talk to her. But she's also wailing that Mike has somehow turned me against her it's all his fault. My family sides with me, they’ve all seen first hand how awful GM was to him. 

Now I'm getting bombarded with messages from family I've never even met(my GM's siblings, neices, and nephews)saying I'm TA for doing that to her.

A few weeks ago I went to a concert in the major city and then drove back the same night because I had work in the morning. A few weeks before that, I drove up to a show after work, then again drove back the same night because I had another event the next day.

I posted pics from these concerts on my social media stories... only to find out that my uncle has been texting my mom saying that I keep driving up to the city but not coming to ""check in on"" them. Even though they don't even live in that city--they live in the town I grew up in which is another hour in the opposite direction.

I may be TA here because my grandmother lost our grandfather in April and I haven't seen them in 2 years. But I've never been super close with my grandmother and we usually only saw her once every few months anyway. My uncle and mom have a tense relationship and I haven't seen my uncle in 2-3 years.

A few weeks ago I went to a concert in the major city and then drove back the same night because I had work in the morning. A few weeks before that, I drove up to a show after work, then again drove back the same night because I had another event the next day.

I posted pics from these concerts on my social media stories... only to find out that my uncle has been texting my mom saying that I keep driving up to the city but not coming to ""check in on"" them. Even though they don't even live in that city--they live in the town I grew up in which is another hour in the opposite direction.

I may be TA here because my grandmother lost our grandfather in April and I haven't seen them in 2 years. But I've never been super close with my grandmother and we usually only saw her once every few months anyway. My uncle and mom have a tense relationship and I haven't seen my uncle in 2-3 years. I didn't attend the funeral to support my mom, who didn't feel comfortable going because of things my uncle has said to her in the past.

So AITA for not driving the extra hour to visit them after concerts?

99,1fxxhal,AITA for making a joke to my FMIL?,"Hi people! This just happened so it’s still fresh. I live with my boyfriend and his mom, and 98% of the time it’s perfectly fine. The 2% of the time is when she makes fun of me/everyone else, but when anyone makes jokes to her she immediately plays victim like it’s the end of the world. The main little thing she makes fun of me for is my pickiness when it comes to food. I don’t eat a lot of different foods or try new things a lot, just my normal cheeseburger or chicken tenders. She loves to cook different foods for everyone, but a lot of the time I don’t eat what she cooks, which is normally okay. I encourage her to make foods she wants even if I don’t eat it because I don’t have a big appetite anyway. 

Now what happened a little bit ago, she was going through the cabinets finding something to eat and was talking about getting groceries for the week. She was saying she doesn’t know what I would eat or what to get me and said I should make out a list of what I would eat. She said it while laughing so I made a joke saying I would just write “Nothing” on it (I was laughing and it was very much a clear joke). She didn’t understand so I explained it saying that I don’t eat much so I would just write “Nothing.” She then started sarcastically laughing and saying I was being a smart mouth. My boyfriend was sitting next to me and he was telling her I wasn’t being a “smart mouth” and she got quiet. She left whatever she had out and just went to her room, slamming the door behind her. She was saying she was just trying to be nice. I never said I wouldn’t and I appreciate her trying, I was making a joke that they [her and her mom] make about me. I just sat there stunned asking my boyfriend what I did wrong and he affirmed me that I didn’t do anything wrong and he doesn’t know what’s wrong with her. He went to her room to ask what happened and she kinda just repeated that she was trying to be nice and he explained that we understood but it was a joke, not even aimed towards her. She just kept repeating the same things and he just said whatever and was done with it. I just feel bad because I honestly was making a self inflicted joke, nothing to her at all. It’s also my boyfriends birthday and now his mom doesn’t want to even be in here with us. I just don’t know if I did something wrong.

101,1fxx96p,AITA for not making something for my mom ,"At the risk of being repetitive, I am posting a shorter version since I forgot this was the main sub. Yesterday, my parents + I were supposed to go out for my birthday dinner. I told them I didn't have a lot of extra spending money, and wasn't really planning to celebrate/that they didn't have to do anything for me, but they insisted they would treat me. 

Mom texts me while I'm getting ready. 'I need you to send me the focaccia recipe because I'm supposed to bring it to an event on Monday so I need to buy the ingredients'. I figured, 'oh cool, she's gonna try to make it'. I replied 'Kk', hold on' + sent a picture. 

Later, she said, 'I'm actually having you make the bread, so you can make it tomorrow for it to be ready on Monday'. I was a bit confused because her text read like she was going to make the bread, and she hadn't really asked me first if I could make it. I said, 'I'm sorry, I can't'. She said, 'Why?' I said 'I don't think I'm going to have time because I have some training that I needed to get done this weekend & I was going to work on it on whatever night we weren't going to dinner just because there's a lot of it to get finished'. 

She responded with, 'you have plenty of time, but if you can't make it, then forget it, I just won't bring it'. 

I said that it sounded like she was going to make it because she asked for the recipe. She punctuated this with 'You know, I just can't fucking believe you wouldn't make the time to make it!' before going to her room. 


She later said 'I don't ask you to do very much, but the only reason you aren't doing this isn't because you can't, it's because you're selfish/you just don't want to.'

 I replied 'It's not fair for you to say that, because you've asked me to do this for you before, and I have. It's not that I don't actually want to help you, but that I have things for work I was going to dedicate time to this weekend, and wished you'd asked me earlier.'
 
She claimed I’d feel the same as her if the roles were reversed. I told her that I respect others’ boundaries and don't take it personally/try to guilt trip them when they have to say no. That I gave her my reasons, but she chose to believe otherwise.

During this convo, she called me 'little girl' (I'm 24 btw) and told me that I 'sounded r*tarded'. I told her I was done talking because she was being very disrespectful to me, and I wasn't going to stand there while she spoke to me that way. Of course, she wouldn't let me disengage from that convo & told me that I wasn't going to walk away from her in 'her house'. 

It made me feel like I owed her this favor, and I told her that it felt like she wanted this conversation to happen; and a reason *not* to want to do the birthday dinner after that/hold it over my head, and frankly, I didn't either. 

‎ She tears up saying that it makes her feel taken advantage of/taken for granted, esp since she was spending money on me, that she felt like I didn't love her, I wouldn't care if something happened to her, etc.

I’m considering not letting the kids over like that if she’s going to be over when they are. I think it’s weird. I can’t scratch the feeling of her wishing ill onto my kids.

First off, I (48F) am not a chef, I can make a few meals that turn out pretty darn good but not many. My husband (45) does almost all the cooking because he can cook and it's almost always very tasty. He cooks, I clean up. Awesome sauce!

He has been having a hankering for chili since it's getting cooler and I agreed it sounded yummy. He started telling me what he would put in it and I asked if he could maybe skip an ingredient or two. Like chunks of tomatoes. They gross me out. Well, he got offended and told me to find a recipe that suits my needs. I did. 

As I'm heading to the grocery store I double and triple check with him what he needs for the chili. Apparently he had a bug up his butt because he was like ""You looked at recipes right? Then you should know what to get."" So I look at the recipe again, write down what I need to buy and leave. 

When I return he unloads the groceries and goes ham and potatoes because I got ONE can of beans. That's what the recipe called for, so I got it. He starts yelling at me because how can he make this amazing meal with ONE can of beans. Mind you I got everything else but this is just undid him.

     Here is the problem: She is absolutely the worst at her job. She has zero instinct for how to take care of this child. She constantly asks me for advice on how to improve, but any advice I give her seems to go in one ear and out the other.

     For example, the kid she works with only positively responds when an instructor is using a positive, playful voice. But no matter how many times I've reminded her of that or showed her examples, she uses a very angry voice to scold the child. In our job, you're not supposed to use hard no-s. You're supposed to redirect (give the student a new task that replaces the problem behavior). I've reminded her of this countless times, but it doesn't take. She just tells the child, ""No! Stop it now!"" in a very scolding tone, when it's clear that the child doesn't understand. This isnt the only problem by far, but its one that isnt too specific to the child's needs.

     Part of her responsibility is balancing when the child has to sit down vs explore their surroundings. But my coworker does it all-or nothing: either the student is restrained in her lap for way too long (which distressed them to the point of a full meltdown, which she doesnt understand how to stop despite me showing her how) or she let's the student roam around with virtually no supervision, when that student requires extreme supervision. Her student winds up putting things in their mouth, getting into things they shouldn't have been touching, and interrupting other students learning.

106,1fxwaiv,"WIBTA Navigating Cultural Differences and Unwanted Expectations: A Tale of Hospitality Gone Wrong

","While waiting in front of a café, I unexpectedly encountered a fellow countryman. He approached me rudely, asking for directions to his hotel. Initially taken aback, I soon realized this was merely a cultural difference and chose to overlook his rudeness, gladly guiding him to his destination. As our conversation unfolded, I learned that he was visiting for an ocular operation at a prestigious eye clinic. Given the rampant corruption in my country following the Arab Spring, I couldn’t help but question the legitimacy of his finances.



Our discussion began with general topics but quickly escalated to exploring educational opportunities and my aspirations to engage in trade with my homeland. The following day, he called me, seeking recommendations for places to visit. I suggested a trendy area by the port, filled with upscale restaurants, which sparked his desire to extend his stay. I enthusiastically shared everything he wanted to know about the country.



The next day, he introduced me to his uncle, who had accompanied him to support him during his eye clinic visits. Together, the three of us went to the clinic, where the PR and marketing atmosphere made me uneasy. Many Gulf patients were present, and I expected to translate for the doctor. However, an administrative staff member handled it instead, leading to a disorienting day. This admin even gave me her personal number, offering to help me find a job and residence.



As his visit continued, our relationship deepened. Yet, I sensed a growing desperation within myself, a profound longing to return home to pursue business opportunities. Although our communication increased, I began to notice an elitist attitude emerging from him. He criticized me for not praying and for keeping my personal life private. While I was uncomfortable with his judgments, I hesitated to confront him about crossing my boundaries. Our interactions with his uncle often left me feeling disrespected, as he would repeatedly slap me playfully, ignoring my requests for respect.



When the hotel prices increased, they needed to relocate. The uncle initially sought my assistance, which I was happy to provide. However, my countryman pressured me to visit every hotel in the area. After a lengthy search, I finally secured a place in Seville, but I couldn't get a refund for the initial reservation. Frustrated by the lack of gratitude and feeling emotionally entangled, I managed to find another hotel and booked it for them, receiving repayment plus extra money.



During our conversations about my business ideas, he offered valuable advice, emphasizing the importance of documentation to protect all parties involved in business contracts. This gesture built my trust in him, and I introduced him to a business contact in Egypt who worked at a bank. To my surprise, they quickly bonded and agreed on importing cement from Egypt. I felt hesitant to ask for a commission for the introduction, keeping that feeling to myself. Just yesterday, my business associate in Egypt informed me they were preparing for an advance payment, and I felt betrayed that my friend hadn’t mentioned anything about the transaction.



As my countryman’s visit drew to a close, his uncle instructed me to host him for three days and take good care of him. The uncle expressed his gratitude and honoured me by telling me that if I ever needed a business opportunity back home to never hesitate texting him. Given his esteem, I was honoured but I feel hesistant as he is a man of importance and esteem, but his humility and empathy never showed. Anyways, These days proved to be challenging. In my own home, he imposed his rules. During two outings, he convinced me that I should pay for everything, manipulating the conversation to suggest that it was an Arab custom to be generous and selfless. Eventually, I realized I was losing a significant amount of money. When I confronted him, he erupted in anger, claiming my kindness would be repaid when my father received an invitation, emphasizing that my father’s esteemed lineage in our country warranted such respect. He then gaslighted me, suggesting we could end our relationship if I was unhappy.



I am now at a crossroads, trying to assert myself in this relationship while continuing to support him. I have conducted extensive research as he considers studying English, reaching out to schools, soliciting pricing information, and meticulously exploring lodging and living expenses. Meanwhile, I feel blindsided by the realization that the cement business does not involve me at all. 



",TL;DR,2024-10-07,"WIBTA Navigating Cultural Differences and Unwanted Expectations: A Tale of Hospitality Gone Wrong

 While waiting in front of a café, I unexpectedly encountered a fellow countryman. He approached me rudely, asking for directions to his hotel. Initially taken aback, I soon realized this was merely a cultural difference and chose to overlook his rudeness, gladly guiding him to his destination. As our conversation unfolded, I learned that he was visiting for an ocular operation at a prestigious eye clinic. Given the rampant corruption in my country following the Arab Spring, I couldn’t help but question the legitimacy of his finances.



Our discussion began with general topics but quickly escalated to exploring educational opportunities and my aspirations to engage in trade with my homeland. The following day, he called me, seeking recommendations for places to visit. I suggested a trendy area by the port, filled with upscale restaurants, which sparked his desire to extend his stay. I enthusiastically shared everything he wanted to know about the country.



The next day, he introduced me to his uncle, who had accompanied him to support him during his eye clinic visits. Together, the three of us went to the clinic, where the PR and marketing atmosphere made me uneasy. Many Gulf patients were present, and I expected to translate for the doctor. However, an administrative staff member handled it instead, leading to a disorienting day. This admin even gave me her personal number, offering to help me find a job and residence.

108,1fxvnii,AITA for refusing to take my friend’s dog to the emergency vet after I accidentally hurt him?,"So, I need some perspective here because I’m feeling a bit guilty, but also unsure if I was really in the wrong.

Last weekend, I was at my friend Seraphina’s place for a small game night with a few others. She has this huge, hyper golden retriever named Ronan, who is basically the friendliest dog ever but also a bit of a handful. He’s the type of dog that’s always bouncing around and getting in everyone’s face because he’s so excited to see you.

At one point, I was walking through the living room with a glass of wine when Ronan, as usual, ran up to me full-speed. I wasn’t really paying attention, and when he jumped up on me, I kind of panicked and tried to move out of the way. But in the process, I stepped on his paw pretty hard. He yelped, and I immediately felt horrible. Ronan limped off for a bit, and Seraphina freaked out, understandably.

I apologized right away, but Seraphina was in full panic mode. Ronan was limping for a few minutes, but then he seemed to shake it off and started walking around more normally, even wagging his tail. Still, Seraphina insisted we should take him to the emergency vet right then and there because she was worried I’d really hurt him, like maybe fractured his paw or something.

Here’s where things got awkward. I told her I thought Ronan was fine. He wasn’t crying or limping anymore, and it didn’t seem serious enough to rush him to the vet in the middle of the night. I suggested we wait until morning, and if Ronan seemed worse, I’d totally cover the cost of a vet visit. Seraphina wasn’t having it, though—she was really upset, saying I didn’t care about what I did to her dog and that I should take responsibility right away by taking him to the emergency vet.

I get that it’s her dog, and I did feel bad, but at the same time, Ronan seemed okay to me, and I didn’t think it made sense to rush to an emergency vet over what seemed like a minor injury. I didn’t want to spend a ton of money (or time) at a vet for something I didn’t think was serious. So I stood my ground and said we should wait and see. Seraphina got really upset and said I was being selfish. I ended up leaving shortly after, and now she’s barely speaking to me.

So, was I being a jerk for not taking Ronan to the vet right away?

I have no problem with anyone in their family talking about her in front of me, I understand as that was his first love and his childhood friend. Though, I'm uncomfortable how much she compares me to her.

For example, on my boyfriends birthday the topic of his late girlfriend (who we'll call Maxine) came up and she almost immediately started talking about how we're so similar and we could be blood related.

She's also made comments about my body and how my boyfriend always preferred skinny woman/girls (I'm 130 and Maxine weighted 110).

Honestly I don't really care if she just does this every once in a while but it's every single fucking day.

Yesterday was Maxine's birthday and my boyfriend had asked me to accompany him to her grave which I did.

Her family (parents and siblings) plus my boyfriends parents and sister was there as well. I was kinda sitting next to my boyfriend, comforting him when he began to cry and that's when Alyssa started to compare me to her.

She said Maxine could comfort him and he would be happy within 5 minutes and how I was only making him more sad. Obviously as the title says I lasted out on her and called her a physcotic bitch who needed therapy for comparing me to someone who was no longer here 25/8.

They had another baby a year ago so I also watched him. They would invite us over a lot and have dinner, share some of their edibles/ smoke, drinks and just hang out and talk. We became pretty close after living next to each other for years. We’d have each other’s backs and look out for another if any sketchy things took place on the neighborhood. 

Well, about 4 months ago they moved 5 minutes down the road. While they were in the moving process, I offered to help them out by asking if they’d want me to watch their boys so they can move things. They asked if they could leave their boat in our yard just for a few days until they settled in their house and would come get. 

We were like oh yeah of course. So a week went by, a month, 2 months and we didn’t say anything at all about the boat still being there and also hadn’t heard anything about the plan for them to pick up?? So we messaged, hey are you planning on getting the boat? He replies oh yeah we’ll get this weekend. No message saying he will come get and didn’t hear anything for another week. Asked again pretty irritated, and he comes to pick it up. 

Well the boat needs a new tire, so now he’s gotta leave and buy a new tire to haul it home. 
It’s been a week almost 2 weeks and he hasn’t even communicated about coming to get the boat. We are not only so over having this boat here in our yard, but also feel disrespected as we let them borrow our space/ our property for a while now. So my husband told them if they weren’t coming to pick up, he was going to set out by the road for someone to pick up. Are we the assholes for saying this?

116,1fxumgs,AITA for accidentally having my friend 3rd wheel at a football game & asking her friend if she was shit-talking me instead of going directly to her?,"Last Friday, I attended a football game with Lia, as our friend Paula had other plans. We were a trio. At the time, I was in a talking stage with a football player named Jack, who wasn't supposed to be at the game due to a practice conflict. However, I unexpectedly ran into him with Lia, and we ended up spending time together with Lia, while Lia was aware of my interest in him.

During the game, I had to leave Lia for about 30 minutes to help a friend experiencing a panic attack. When I returned, Lia confronted me about leaving her alone, showing no concern for my friend’s distress. Later, she expressed surprise upon realizing Jack was the guy I was talking to, saying  she  didnt realize Jack was the guy i was talking to and accused me of dragging her to the game to flirt with him. I reacted defensively since she was yelling at me, arguing that it wasn’t my intention to make her feel like a third wheel and that her dry responses made conversation difficult.

Although I apologized for her feelings, Lia remained upset, and I tried to check in with her multiple times, but she kept saying she was fine. I noticed her texting Paula about the situation without being honest with me and saying she was texting her mom. The next day, Paula confronted me, having only heard Lia's side, and they both criticized how I handled the situation.

After reflecting, I apologized to Lia for dismissing her feelings, realizing I should have prioritized our friendship over Jack and told him to hangout with his friends so Lia wouldnt feel left out. However, when Paula asked Lia to apologize, Lia only gave a vague yes & nod. A couple of days later, I overheard them gossiping about me on the bus. When I approached them, they ignored my request for clarity and instead teamed up against me, criticizing my choice to ask Lia’s friend if she was talking about me instead of asking Lia directly, which occured before we all ""apologized"" to eachother.

I argued that it was natural to be suspicious when Lia was silent and glaring at me, but then talkative as soon as i left. And I didn’t trust her because she hadn’t been honest about her feelings and actions at the football game in the first place. Paula defended Lia, suggesting her behavior was due to being a ""people pleaser,"" and when asked if she would tell me the truth if she were gossiping, Lia hesitated before nodding. This moment confirmed my feelings that Paula was siding with Lia throughout our discussions and making excuses for Lia while talking for her, even though Paula wasnt even there or heard my side.

Im now wondering, AITA for not accepting Lia's apology, for calling Lia a liar, and for not going to Lia directly to ask if she was shit talking me? Because  right now it seems like all odds are against me.",Asshole,2024-10-07,"AITA for accidentally having my friend 3rd wheel at a football game & asking her friend if she was shit-talking me instead of going directly to her?
