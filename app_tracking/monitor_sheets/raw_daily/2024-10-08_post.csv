0,1fzcnti,AITA for not giving my wedding dress to my ex?,"This is difficult so bear with me. I (29F) was married to ‚ÄúAnna‚Äù (31F) for 3 years. We had been friends since high school and married as soon as we were both out of college. Anna is trans and came out about 2 years in but had been hiding it for a long time.  It was an extremely difficult time for both of us and ultimately I couldn‚Äôt stay.  It had less to do with her being a woman and more to do with her personality and behavior changing so much and not in a good way. The person I fell for didn‚Äôt exist anymore and maybe never did.  Divorcing was messy and painful, and I avoid her as much as I can.

I finally started dating last year and I‚Äôve met someone. When we started making plans to move in, I decided that it was a good time to do a clear out. I still had my wedding dress and I decided to pass it on to someone else who could make better memories with it. It was my perfect dress, and I know a lot of people who are either planning or about to be planning their weddings.

I posted about it on SM so my friends could have first dibs and several people were interested. The next day, I get an email from Anna who says she wants the dress. It was an odd request because at last report through mutual friends she is still single and I can‚Äôt imagine what she would do with the dress. Our body sizes are so different that I don‚Äôt think the dress could even be altered to fit her. So I told her that another friend had already called dibs.

Anna has been arguing at me - I‚Äôm trying not to engage, so at not with - ever since, saying that it was her wedding too and she should take precedence over some rando. It‚Äôs the least I could do. Several of her friends have contacted me to tell me what a terrible person I am and how upset refusing has made her when she‚Äôs already having a rough time.

I‚Äôm conflicted now because this obviously means a lot to her, but the idea that she would keep my wedding dress when we‚Äôre divorced and not really even friends makes me feel weird. I think it would be better for the dress to go to someone who‚Äôs going to love it and wear it on their special day.",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-10-08,"AITA for not giving my wedding dress to my ex?

1,1fz8owd,AITA for not having Christmas with my mum every year and not going on holiday with her? ,"To start, my mum has recently told me she will 'never have Christmas with me again'. This is because last year I did not spend Christmas with her.

For context a couple years ago me and my partner separated, but we have a positive and friendly co-parenting relationship and have decided while our child is young we will spend Christmas together. So last year I went to my ex's extended family Christmas gathering. Previously (when we were still together) my mum would have been invited to my ex's family's  Christmases, although she would always complain about it and I don't think enjoyed it very much. This time she wasn't invited, but I went anyway as I wanted to spend Christmas with my child. She was really angry with me. I thought she would have got over it, but the other day she said because of my behavior last year she won't spend Christmas with me again. 

The other thing she is recurringly angry with me about is not going on holiday with her. I have offered to buy her a holiday (she has been poor a long time) but she won't take the offer up as she's hurt I won't go with her. I do understand why she'd be hurt by this, but the thought of spending a few days just her and me makes me feel quite anxious and I don't have a tonne of money, so if I'm buying myself a holiday I'd like to know I'm going to have a relaxing time.

3,1fz854l,AITA for excluding my step mom from a lunch with me and my dad?,"This weekend I am celebrating getting my university ring and I told my dad I wanted him to be there. He currently lives 7 hours away from me with my step mom and I have only seen him 3 times since last September. The last time was in May and it wasn't a great visit considering it was me, my dad, and my step mom attending a funeral and I got no actual time with him. Recently I've been trying to plan for the weekend celebration by texting my step mom what kind of food she liked and that we could even order it to go and eat somewhere else since she does not like being around people all that much. I was planning a lot with her, trying to make her feel included and accommodated. I then texted my dad the idea of a lunch with just him and I so I could get some father-daughter time alone since the last time I had gotten that was last Christmas. Apparently my dad told my step mom later that day about my plan to have lunch with him and she got upset and felt left out. My dad told me that night that we weren't going to leave her alone and that she was his wife and it was unfair to her. I was very upset, both deeply hurt and sad since I felt he was prioritizing her feelings over mine and I was having to fight tooth and nail just to have some alone time with my own dad. I've discussed it more with my dad since then and when I asked what the issue was and I didn't understand why she wouldn't let us have something as simple as maybe 2 hours together, he said she was feeling left out of everything. I got very upset and personally think that is a nonsensical conclusion to come to since I have been very open with including her and thought 1 meal with my dad was a fair compromise.

But I am very tired. I do not want to work or study. I get my tiny salary for three hours of work per day - and that's it, that's all. I'm not ready and i don't want to do anything more, even if it will only make things worse for my family. AITA?",1.0,0.0061791427,0,0
8,1fz78l0,AITA for lying about my relationship status to my friend? ,"I (28f) I‚Äôm close friends with my friend (27f) for over 7 years. We don‚Äôt meet often but we exchange texts daily most of the time and meet occasionally whenever we can. 

I‚Äôm a very private person I don‚Äôt like sharing things with different people and even on social media I don‚Äôt share personal news or achievements etc, only some pics about things I like here and there. But I‚Äôm also open with my few close friends which includes this friend. 

When it comes to relationships I don‚Äôt date casually or for fun (idc about others u do u) but for me I only commit to serious relationships and I didn‚Äôt date often (only 2 long serious relationships including the one I‚Äôm in right now) 

I have gotten with my current bf over a year ago, I only told my close friends  and family after a couple of months when I was sure of the relationship and didn‚Äôt share much, I answered when they asked and that‚Äôs all. 

My friend on the other hand is the type to jump from a bf to another, get obsessed over them for a couple of months, then get ‚Äúbored‚Äù when they reciprocate her feelings and end up breaking up and moving on to the next obsession. 

Now I get it when we were young in our early twenties I didn‚Äôt bother with it much but now we‚Äôre older and she doesn‚Äôt seem to change.  ( I don‚Äôt like it but I never commented on it)
I appreciate her as a friend and we‚Äôre there for each other in difficult times but we never agreed on the relationships subject.

During my relationship when we talk or hang out she asks how me and my bf are doing and so on and I just answer briefly, which comes from 2 reasons: 

1- as I said I‚Äôm kinda private and also my bf is the same as me so we don‚Äôt share about our things much, people know we‚Äôre together but that‚Äôs it, other than that it‚Äôs our business. 

2- once at the beginning of my  relationship she asked me to show her my bf, I showed her his pic and when she saw him she said smth along the lines of ‚Äúoh he‚Äôs very handsome I‚Äôd let him fuck me too‚Äù which kinda irked me and gave me the ick cuz who says that about their friend‚Äôs bf. (She didn‚Äôt say she was kidding or apologized whatsoever) 

Anyway fast forward to a couple of months back me and my bf had a bad period (sickness, job related problems and so on) it affected us and we got in a big argument, at the time she asked me and I wasn‚Äôt really well or in a good mental state so I said we‚Äôre not together anymore and ended the conversation cuz I didn‚Äôt want to answer questions about what happened etc..

Now me and my bf at that time ended up talking it out and making up and continued our relationship (we never broke up in the first place). And I didn‚Äôt bother correcting what I said before to my friend so now she thinks I‚Äôm single while I‚Äôm not.

Now I‚Äôm feeling guilty for lying but also idk how to explain what happened or if I actually want to explain in the first place considering the reasons I said above. 

So AITA? Should I tell her the truth or just ignore the subject ? ",No A-holes here,2024-10-08,"AITA for lying about my relationship status to my friend?

My niece is 9 and my nephew is 7. Anna died 3 years ago. Josh remarried 1 year ago. His current wife is Hazel.

I'll confess it has been awkward, uncomfortable and my BIL has admitted that he feels it too. We're still close, still best friends too. But it's weird and hurts sometimes to see him with someone else. I'm happy he's happy but Anna was my sister so the emotions are a lot more complex. He understands. My niece and nephew have struggled to accept Hazel. My nephew doesn't really remember his mom but my niece talks about her a lot and BIL talks about her too. He has never wanted to forget her/erase her or let her memory fade. 

Hazel and I get along okay. We're not close. I admit that we don't really talk or engage much. There have been some weird moments. She didn't love me and my family being at the wedding or taking care of the kids that day (BIL asked). She had wanted her parents to take care of the kids. She has also said she finds it weird that I'm Anna's brother. While I struggle with Josh being married to someone who isn't Anna. But I'm also happy for his happiness.

A week ago Hazel and I got into a fight and it has caused some extra tension. She told me she was uncomfortable in my house and that I needed to remove the family photos of Anna, Josh and the kids and Anna and Josh's wedding photos. And even mine because Anna and Josh were in them too. I laughed at first thinking she couldn't be serious, but she was. She said she always looks to see if I still have them and then said I should take them down and put up some of them (her and Josh and the kids). She also wanted me to remove the wall of Anna's art in our dining room. This is different paintings/drawings Anna did for me/us over the years. She told me Anna's dead. Anna's the past and she (Hazel) is the future. I told her Anna is my sister, not her and I can have photos of my sister in my home if I want to. She told me I can't deny her this because I even have childhood photos of Anna on the walls and she's letting them go even though she feels they should be gone too. She said the kids see themselves in her kid photos and it's making it harder for her to get into their hearts. She told me I have no right to make her so uncomfortable. I said she should not be this insanely entitled at her age (32). That she should be grown enough to know she can't dictate other people's houses. Josh came in and asked Hazel to go home early. He asked me to have the kids three days last week too which we did. Hazel didn't like it and she accused me of taking the kids out of spite so I can fill their heads with talk about Anna.

12,1fz6qlk,"AITA for refusing to include my younger cousin in my ""pajama party""? ","I (21f) have a younger cousin who's 11. When she was younger, we had a very close bond. She's my only cousin, and I always loved children so I loved looking after her. But as she grew up we started being less close, partly because I moved away and we see each other less, but also because she turned into a bit of a brat. 

She's still a nice kid and I like to see her at family events, but she's a bit spoiled and entitled. I think that's because she's an only child, and her mother had many failed pregnancies before she had her (or so I've heard), so her parents give her anything she wants and treat her like a princess. For that reason, she sometimes throws tantrums over unreasonable things and gets very angry when things don't go her way. I have a few examples of that, but I'll try to make this post as short as possible so if you want to know I'll gladly answer. 

So, Sunday we had a family dinner and she was there, and as I was talking with the adults a bit, they asked if I had plans for the week or something. I told them that I was getting together with my friends on Friday, and that they were coming to my place. She overheard and asked me if she could come. I didn't think she was being serious because 1. she lives 2 hours away and 2. it would be weird for her to be there. 

But apparently she was serious, because I received a text from her mother yesterday asking for the info for my ""pajama party"". I told her that it was a misunderstanding and that my cousin wasn't invited, but that I'd love to do something with her on Saturday or another weekend. She started telling me that my cousin really wanted to come, that I should be a nice cousin and let her come, that she was old enough to do things with me, and that it probably wouldn't bother my friends. 

Here's the thing: we were planning on doing a cocktails night, inspired by our ex-relationships (like some people have done on TikTok). So I told her that she couldn't come because it wasn't a ""pajama party"" but a drinking night, and that we would be discussing things that aren't necessarily appropriate for a kid her age. She's now telling me that I'm doing everything I can to exclude my cousin, that I'm mean, that I'm putting my friends over my family, and she's trying to guilt trip me into inviting her. 

I feel like I'm not in the wrong here, but maybe I'm just not seeing the problem and am actually being an AH. I really don't know, is it wrong of me to not invite her?

14,1fz6cwz,WIBTA if I told my mum what I overheard our guest seen on the phone to her friend,"WIBTA if I told my mom what I overheard our guest saying on the phone to her friend?

For context, I live in a country where ‚Äòfoster care‚Äô is prevalent, though it‚Äôs not formal foster care. When low-income families can‚Äôt afford to care for their children, they often give them to wealthier families. These families cover schooling, food, and shelter in exchange for help around the house.

In this case, my grandma had a foster daughter, K, who helped out in her shop. When my grandma moved to Canada, K had nowhere to go, and her family couldn‚Äôt take her back. So, my mom, being the eldest child, took responsibility for K, even though she was reluctant. We only have four bedrooms, and it would be another mouth to feed. K had already applied to university, and without my mom paying the tuition and dorm fees, she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to attend.

Now, K comes back to our house during every university holiday. She helps out around the kitchen, mainly washing dishes, though she wasn‚Äôt specifically asked to do so‚Äîit seems more out of courtesy. She also cooks with us since it‚Äôs expected for women to be in the kitchen in our culture. Recently, K got a nanny job, and she works weekdays, coming home by 5 p.m.

One day, after my mom returned from a conference, she asked K to cook dinner. I passed by the kitchen and overheard K on the phone, crying. She was telling her friend how my mom doesn‚Äôt give her a moment of peace. She mentioned she hadn‚Äôt even had time to shower before being asked to cook. This surprised me, as it‚Äôs rare for her to be asked to cook since I usually prep meals during my university break.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering, WIBTA if I told my mom what I overheard? I don‚Äôt want to snitch, just let my mom know so she can take it easy on K. But I‚Äôm unsure how she‚Äôll react. She might get defensive, saying things like, ‚ÄúI pay for her uni fees, her dog, her phone, her clothes, and even though everything‚Äôs more expensive now, she still lives here for free.‚Äù I‚Äôm worried she might stop supporting K if she gets upset, though my mom is usually very kind. I just don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll react.

Edit: K is in her 20s (22-25) so no this is not child slavery lol she willingly comes her every school break, also I‚Äôve decided not to tell my mom but then it got me thinking about what k said to her friend and I have some internal feelings the first one being when I was thinking about how to help her more often yesterday night because she said she was being overworked here to her friend I was thinking about all the things she does and I didn‚Äôt find an instant she was being overworked like we have a maid, so she doesn‚Äôt really do chores and we all cook together in the kitchen like 90% of the time we also have a second guest with us right now and she helps K out with the cooking that I don‚Äôt help her out with so her saying that we overwork her when we literally do everything together and it‚Äôs crazy. And also you guys are acting like we do my mom makes her come here every holiday she is the one that asked my mum whether she could stay with us and my mum always says yes, even if we have a guest currently that‚Äôs why we have two guest and one kid in our house right now and we only live in a four bedroom house.

And for those that were telling me why would I even think of telling my mum? I only mentioned the worst case scenario which is like 30% possible that my mom would react that way my mom is normally super chill any time kids doing something like picking up the dishes to take to the kitchen my mom will tell us to go through it cause K isn‚Äôt our ‚Äòmaid‚Äô so no my mom does not abuse k and K isn‚Äôt in any child slavery like situation

So, my mom, being the eldest child, took responsibility for K, even though she was reluctant. We only have four bedrooms, and it would be another mouth to feed. K had already applied to university, and without my mom paying the tuition and dorm fees, she wouldn‚Äôt have been able to attend.

Now, K comes back to our house during every university holiday. She helps out around the kitchen, mainly washing dishes, though she wasn‚Äôt specifically asked to do so‚Äîit seems more out of courtesy. She also cooks with us since it‚Äôs expected for women to be in the kitchen in our culture. Recently, K got a nanny job, and she works weekdays, coming home by 5 p.m.

One day, after my mom returned from a conference, she asked K to cook dinner. I passed by the kitchen and overheard K on the phone, crying. She was telling her friend how my mom doesn‚Äôt give her a moment of peace. She mentioned she hadn‚Äôt even had time to shower before being asked to cook. This surprised me, as it‚Äôs rare for her to be asked to cook since I usually prep meals during my university break.

Now, I‚Äôm wondering, WIBTA if I told my mom what I overheard? I don‚Äôt want to snitch, just let my mom know so she can take it easy on K. But I‚Äôm unsure how she‚Äôll react. She might get defensive, saying things like, ‚ÄúI pay for her uni fees, her dog, her phone, her clothes, and even though everything‚Äôs more expensive now, she still lives here for free.‚Äù I‚Äôm worried she might stop supporting K if she gets upset, though my mom is usually very kind. I just don‚Äôt know how she‚Äôll react.

Edit: K is in her 20s (22-25) so no this is not child slavery lol she willingly comes her every school break, also I‚Äôve decided not to tell my mom but then it got me thinking about what k said to her friend and I have some internal feelings the first one being when I was thinking about how to help her more often yesterday night because she said she was being overworked here to her friend I was thinking about all the things she does and I didn‚Äôt find an instant she was being overworked like we have a maid, so she doesn‚Äôt really do chores and we all cook together in the kitchen like 90% of the time we also have a second guest with us right now and she helps K out with the cooking that I don‚Äôt help her out with so her saying that we overwork her when we literally do everything together and it‚Äôs crazy. And also you guys are acting like we do my mom makes her come here every holiday she is the one that asked my mum whether she could stay with us and my mum always says yes, even if we have a guest currently that‚Äôs why we have two guest and one kid in our house right now and we only live in a four bedroom house.

And for those that were telling me why would I even think of telling my mum? I only mentioned the worst case scenario which is like 30% possible that my mom would react that way my mom is normally super chill any time kids doing something like picking up the dishes to take to the kitchen my mom will tell us to go through it cause K isn‚Äôt our ‚Äòmaid‚Äô so no my mom does not abuse k and K isn‚Äôt in any child slavery like situation

15,1fz6alb,WIBTA for telling my best friend that her new friend creeps me out?,"My \[33F\] best friend Amy \[32F\] has introduced this new friend Brett \[34M\] to our friend group. Hes living with her for the past month while he finds a place to stay. Everyone in our circle loves him as hes funny and a good laugh when we go to the pub etc. Due to my closeness with Amy, I have seen a lot more of him than others, and im not as enamoured with him. Ive found it a bit difficult that I literally cant see her without seeing him too, as he doesnt really do his own thing, and whenever I've tried to spend 121 time with Amy, hes there. He clearly views her as his new best pal. Amy confornted me saying she could tell something was off with me and that I was coming across territorial. I admit there was a little bit of that and im trying to not let insecurity get the best of me, but there was also something I couldnt put my finger on.

Brett is gay, and very much always on grindr, always talking about sex. Amy jokes that hes a sex pest. The thing is, he seems to have a fixation on young (around 20yrs old) guys, and when he sees younger guys in the pub or outand about he becomes hyperfixated with them and wont stop looking at them and talking to us about them. Ive found it off putting, but made excuses for it (im not in my best mood today, maybe im just being prudish or judgemental).

On Sunday, we were sitting in Amys living room watching the netflix show Heartstopper. Its a wholesome show about two gay british schoolboys finding their first love. One of the characters is quite handsome, and has a very good figure. The actor would have been 18 at the time of filming, but he is playing a schoolboy. The whole time we watched this Brett would literally not stop talking about the things he wanted to do with him. Amy laughed it off, but I was sitting there with my skin crawling. It just felt really creepy and seedy the way he was talking about him. I have absolutely got the ick from Brett and dont want to be around him anymore. I dont consider myself a prude, but the age difference, plus the letchy way he was speaking just revolted me.

17,1fz5ut3,AITA for telling a coworker it was justified she was sent out of the office for sneaking in a dog?,"Today at the office, a woman walked in with a fairly big dog who did not seem well-trained. It was very obviously pulling on the leash and kept trying to approach people. 

I expressed my doubts that this dog was a service animal. Seeing as this was the office, where pets are not allowed, that meant I expressed my doubts this dog was even allowed to be in there. I didn't make a problem of it, I didn't go over to the reception to report it or anything, I simply mentioned it. 

A coworker heard me and mentioned that she had also brought in a dog last week because it couldn't be left alone, and that she was sent out of the building. I told her non-service animals didn't belong there, so if she truly brought in a dog, that it was justified that they sent her away. 

She seemed to get annoyed and retorted that the dog hadn't hurt anyone and if she was expected to be at the office, she didn't really have a choice. Let me just say that I don't dislike animals- but I hate people who act entitled to bring their animals everywhere. I have an allergy for dogs. Fortunately it's pretty mild, so as long as it's just a couple of hours I'm alright, might have a bit of itchy eyes but nothing else. I do also know someone who is allergic enough she couldn't even visit friends who have pets, because she would get breathing issues already. 

So I responded that the responsibility of the dog was hers and that there are people who are bothered by dogs. Either because of allergies, or fear, or whatever other reason they might have. Those people are expected at the office too, and that her desire to have a dog shouldn't negatively impact people who are just going to work. 

She was cold all day after that and several of my colleagues told me I should lighten up and that dogs can liven up a place. Considering dogs aren't allowed anyway and it's a moot point, I'm wondering, AITA for telling her it was justified she was sent home after taking her dog with her.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-08,"AITA for telling a coworker it was justified she was sent out of the office for sneaking in a dog?

21,1fz5fl8,AITA for telling my sister she should take care more of her dog?,"A few years ago it was the birthday of my sister (15f) who begged our parents to get a dog. My sister pleaded her case, stating that she would fully take care of the dog by taking him out on walks daily and feeding him. My mom supported my sister's request, saying that a dog would be nice and that she always wanted one. She also said that she would help out my sister if needed. Meanwhile, my dad and I (18m) were against it. We argued multiple times that the workload of owning a dog is much greater than owning cats, as you have to take them out for walks daily and can't leave them at home for multiple days alone, unlike cats (we have a pet door). (We already have 2 cats)

A few weeks later after my sister's birthday, a puppy Pomeranian appeared at our doorstep. We all loved him, and the first year went flawlessly. Fast forward to the following year (the dog was 1 year old), the first disputes over the dog started arising as my sister slowly started to delegate her tasks to us, citing school as the main excuse. So my mom, my dad, and I started to take on more of an active role. Prior to this, I'd say that my sister took out the dog for a walk and fed him 1/2 a day, and on some days when she couldn't, we would do all of the work - no problem.

Fast forward another year, and the disputes over the dog were getting fairly heated. My sister stated that because of school, she could only take the dog for a walk on weekends, since she wakes up at 6:30 am, with school starting at 8 am and ending at 1 pm. After school, she often goes to the gym or hangs out with friends and comes home around 5 or 6 pm, where she does her homework, eats dinner, and goes to bed by 9:30 pm. So it's generally up to me or my parents to take care of the dog. However, since I'm studying at a university out of my city, I often have to leave early in the morning (7 am) and come back late (7 pm), so I also have little time to help. As a result, it's mainly up to my mom and my dad. My mom works a full-time job, while my dad works a part-time job. For the last year, my dad has mostly taken care of the dog since he's usually at home. However, on some days when my dad goes out to dinner with friends or colleagues, he tells us to take out the dog before going to bed. My sister often says no, and my mom complains that since my dad has a part-time job and is mostly free, he should do more for the dog. In cases like these, I take the dog out for a walk.

My dad generally has a fairly spineless behavior as he doesn't scold my sister for not taking care of the dog she wanted, and doesn't really react to the complaints made by my mom. I think he does this to avoid escalating tensions within the family. However, I believe that the responsibility of the dog should mostly fall on my sister and my mom rather than me and my dad.

AITA for telling my sister she should take care more of her dog?

EDIT:  
TLDR: My mom and sister wanted a dog, my dad and I said no, they got it anyways and it feels like my dad and I are carrying most of the burden of owning a dog.

I forgot to mention that my dad may be looking at getting a full time job, so that might interesting.

After school, she often goes to the gym or hangs out with friends and comes home around 5 or 6 pm, where she does her homework, eats dinner, and goes to bed by 9:30 pm. So it's generally up to me or my parents to take care of the dog. However, since I'm studying at a university out of my city, I often have to leave early in the morning (7 am) and come back late (7 pm), so I also have little time to help. As a result, it's mainly up to my mom and my dad. My mom works a full-time job, while my dad works a part-time job. For the last year, my dad has mostly taken care of the dog since he's usually at home. However, on some days when my dad goes out to dinner with friends or colleagues, he tells us to take out the dog before going to bed. My sister often says no, and my mom complains that since my dad has a part-time job and is mostly free, he should do more for the dog. In cases like these, I take the dog out for a walk.

My dad generally has a fairly spineless behavior as he doesn't scold my sister for not taking care of the dog she wanted, and doesn't really react to the complaints made by my mom. I think he does this to avoid escalating tensions within the family. However, I believe that the responsibility of the dog should mostly fall on my sister and my mom rather than me and my dad.

AITA for telling my sister she should take care more of her dog?

EDIT:  
TLDR: My mom and sister wanted a dog, my dad and I said no, they got it anyways and it feels like my dad and I are carrying most of the burden of owning a dog.

I forgot to mention that my dad may be looking at getting a full time job, so that might interesting.

Is there anything I can do to motivate my sister and mom to take more of an active role? any other general tips?",0.0,0.03350136,0,1

23,1fz57pb,AITA not having worked for 9 months while living with my parents at 24?,"I'm a 24 year old guy living with his parents who hasn't worked in 9 months.

9 months ago I finished my degree in maths and stats. A couple months before finishing I made the decision to switch my plans from teaching to data science. While I had the math background, I had almost zero experience coding/programming, and zero exposure to machine learning. Also, I've never been a studious person. I was always the class clown in high school, and I've always left study to the last minute and scraped through.

Upon finishing uni, I made a promise to myself. As long as I was studying (self study, I don't want to endure a 2 year masters), I wouldn't have to work. If at any point I started slacking, I'd get a job instantly. Nine months later and I've studied roughly 50-70 per week every week. Without going into detail, I've learnt more in the last 9 months than I did in the previous 5 years. I honestly feel like a completely different person, its strange.

Now, you might be thinking I'm just sitting at home leeching off my parents, but it's not that simple. I had a job, often two, all through 2018 to early 2024. I'd work a bunch during uni (mostly as a distraction from study), and 40-50 hours a week during uni holidays. I invested most of my money and ended up with enough to pay off my degree 4 times over. I've offered to pay board but they declined, and I pay for everything else that's mine.

Anyway, getting to the reason for this post. I was talking to my dad the other day and out of nowhere he told me I've done ""f\*\*k all"" for the last year. I asked him to elaborate and he repeated that I've ""done f\*\*k all and achieved f\*\*k all"" in the last year. Damn bruh. Apparently I ""need to get a job instead of f\*\*king around on my computer all day like a loser"". Obviously I *have* been applying to jobs, but only those related to the field. According to him I should get a job in anything, since ""experience matters more than skill"". I personally don't see how a job in anything unrelated to data science would help at all with breaking into the field. As I've mentioned, I'm not short on money, so there's no benefit in getting a random job to earn a few extra dollars. Every hour stacking shelves is an hour I could be learning, reaching out on linkedin etc. The same way I worked a tonne during uni and invested instead of impulse buying junk, I see the last 9 months as an investment into a rewarding career in which I'll feel experienced and confident in my ability. I don't want to drift into a position just because I'm *seen* as competent through a bit of previous experience, I want to be seen as competent because I *am* competent.

I guess I just need to hear it from a stranger or someone with kids and a bit more life experience under the belt. Everyone else has supported me, but friends and people you aren't close to can often be 'yes men'. As it stands, I have zero intention to apply for jobs unrelated to my goals, but perhaps this mindset is wrong.

24,1fz54yz,AITA for sleeping during class?,"For context I'm in high school

The teacher decided to give us self-study time because we were ahead of our schedule. I was really tired because I stayed up late yesterday studying so I wanted to get some sleep. So I decided to sleep through this period because I was tired and I didn't want to miss anything. But the teacher said that if nobody slept everyone would get a merit point. The point does nothing to affect grades or anything. It's nothing academic. And I didn't really care for those points so I decided to sleep anyways.

Fast forward around 20 minutes and people noticed me sleeping. There were around 5 people who were very outspoken and wanted me to get up so they got their points. I wasn't exactly friends with anyone but I especially didn't like them because of how they are normally disruptive, selfish (play volleyball inside the classroom and just overall not caring about anyone else's wellbeing or safety) and just not a very kind person. So I decided to ignore them. Now that got one of them mad. So he decided to just kick my chair repeatedly. Now I knew waking up would just prove they were successful so I stayed down for a few more minutes. But in the end I had to wake up because it's extremely uncomfortable, and as I woke up one of them also decides to call me a curse word. In the end he had to apologize and write an ""apology form"". I didn't exactly want to deal with him anymore so I told him it's fine.


EDIT: I'll explain the entire merit system because it's pretty confusing and stupid. There‚Äôs 2 points, merit and demerit. If you get 15 demerit points in a month there is a council opened for teachers to discuss stuff about you. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many merit points you have. 15 demerits a month and the council is opened. You get demerits for being tardy, dress code violations and just breaking rules. 

Merit points are stuff you get for helping the teacher and stuff like that. I honestly have no clue what an advantage of having merit points is. They don‚Äôt give you stuff or anything it‚Äôs just there. Doesn‚Äôt cancel out the demerits either. So yeah I don‚Äôt really care about these.

25,1fz4uax,AITA? I didn‚Äôt tell my boyfriend my son was adopted ,"I (34F) have a 10-year-old son we‚Äôll call Arthur. I adopted him when he was 2, as his godparent, after his mother passed away and his father was never in the picture.

Arthur has always had trouble making friends, but he made a great one this past year‚Äîa 10-year-old boy in his grade, who we‚Äôll call Elliot. I didn‚Äôt plan on it, but Elliot‚Äôs father (38M), who we‚Äôll call Edward, and I became very close. We come from very different backgrounds: Edward grew up in a stable, high-income home, mostly raising Elliot in Europe until about a year and a half ago when they moved to our area. I grew up in a poor family and was raised by my uncle after my mother died. I had a rough childhood and was involved in crime when I was younger, but I‚Äôve been on the straight and narrow for Arthur‚Äôs sake.

I didn‚Äôt want my relationship with Edward to affect Arthur and Elliot‚Äôs friendship, but after agreeing that the boys would always come first, we began loosely dating about a year ago.

A few weeks ago, Arthur got really sick while Edward was watching him. I was an hour away fixing something at a friend‚Äôs house, and Edward took Arthur to the ER when things got worse. His appendix had burst. When I got there, Arthur was in surgery, and he went into anaphylactic shock due to the anesthetic.

The doctors started asking about family medical history, and I couldn‚Äôt provide any information since I‚Äôm not biologically related to Arthur. I never knew his mother‚Äôs family. Edward tried to help, but I was panicked and lashed out, saying that Arthur wasn‚Äôt my biological son. Edward walked away to give me space. Arthur‚Äôs fine now, but he had some complications and spent a few weeks in the hospital. Since then, Edward and I have barely spoken because of an argument that followed.

Edward was upset that I hadn‚Äôt told him Arthur was adopted. I can understand why, but it never came up, and I didn‚Äôt see the point in mentioning it. I wasn‚Äôt hiding it, but I didn‚Äôt have concrete plans to tell him, either. The situation escalated, and we both said hurtful things. I brought up Elliot‚Äôs mother, who I knew nothing about. I didn‚Äôt really care about her, but I made it seem like I did. From what I knew, Edward had raised Elliot on his own. I feel like our situations are similar, but Edward insists they‚Äôre different. He says it‚Äôs relevant that Arthur isn‚Äôt biologically mine, but I don‚Äôt think it changes anything. I didn‚Äôt want Arthur to know he was adopted before he could fully understand.

We‚Äôve never had an argument like this before. The only time we had a similar conversation was when I told him about my past. I felt like that was relevant because it directly involved me. He was understanding then, and there wasn‚Äôt nearly as much conflict.

Now I‚Äôm unsure if not telling him about Arthur was the right decision. He‚Äôs a kind man, but this caught me off guard, and we both said things we regret.

28,1fz497t,AITA for being angry that a guest ate my food?,"For context, I have a lot of allergies, all revolving around latex in some form.

But there are certain things I can have like cooked tomatoes but not raw ones. My allergies are weird but I just roll with them. 

Right now, I live with my dad rent free because I can‚Äôt afford to live by myself despite having a job. And because of my autism and depression.

Because of my allergies, I am very strict on my food. I usually cook the food for the week and my dad chops up tomatoes so I can use them but not touch them. My dad handles all the cleanup. I absolutely cannot have bananas or avocados anywhere near me. My dad likes avocados but he only has them when I am away and he cleans up very thoroughly afterwards to prevent cross-contamination. As for bananas, we don‚Äôt even keep them in the house because I get sick with even the scent. Also I get rashes if my skin touches any of my allergies and my tongue feels like it is burning if I eat them.

My dad has an out of town guest who is staying for a few days. I don‚Äôt mind him staying in the guest bedroom. 

I didn‚Äôt have time to do meal prep over the weekend, so I asked my mom for a few meals, so I did not have to buy anything and I had something to tide me over for three days. My parents are divorced. She made me a week‚Äôs worth of food and extra for my dad. My boxes were clearly labeled and put to one side of the fridge. She also bought some takeout from a safe restaurant. 

Well, the guest ate some of my food and some of the raw tomatoes my dad had put in a box in the fridge for my use, yesterday while I was at work. So now, I don‚Äôt know what is safe and what is cross-contaminated. My dad doesn‚Äôt understand why I got angry about it.  He did offer to buy me some more food to replace but it is gonna be takeout. I wanted my mom‚Äôs cooking because I don‚Äôt get to eat it anymore that often, since it is rare that she cooks. My aunt brings her home cooked food every two weeks, since she is a doctor. He also thinks that I could cook the food on the stove and it would just be tomatoes cooking. He is right in that way, but I still think I am justified.

I did not tell my mom about the situation.

AITA for being cross with a guest about eating my food?

Edit: Our boxes were labeled with our individual names. Mine with my name. My dad‚Äôs with his name. It did not say Dad. It said his name. For context, our names start with the same letter.

My dad had some food made for him by my mom. The raw tomatoes were on the other side of the fridge in a drawer, completely separate. The guest was welcome to take from my dad‚Äôs boxes but definitely not mine. My dad made it clear that my boxes were off limits. Absolutely no touching my boxes because of my food allergies. I don‚Äôt know if my dad specified my allergies to the guest.

Edit: I don‚Äôt even know if I can touch the boxes and I am too scared to. 

Edit: I do a ton of stuff for my parents, in exchange for living rent free. Cooking all the meals is one thing. I asked my mom for just enough to tide me over. I was willing to pay for it or get takeout. But she kept waving me off. Experience showed me it wasn‚Äôt worth the battle. She would just send it back. She made me Indian food that I was excited to have because I am Indian & it was my childhood food. She was the one who decided to make a week‚Äôs worth.

So I thought I‚Äôd ask first since she gave me an open invitation.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-08,"AITA for being angry that a guest ate my food? For context, I have a lot of allergies, all revolving around latex in some form.

But there are certain things I can have like cooked tomatoes but not raw ones. My allergies are weird but I just roll with them. 

Right now, I live with my dad rent free because I can‚Äôt afford to live by myself despite having a job. And because of my autism and depression.

Because of my allergies, I am very strict on my food. I usually cook the food for the week and my dad chops up tomatoes so I can use them but not touch them. My dad handles all the cleanup. I absolutely cannot have bananas or avocados anywhere near me. My dad likes avocados but he only has them when I am away and he cleans up very thoroughly afterwards to prevent cross-contamination. As for bananas, we don‚Äôt even keep them in the house because I get sick with even the scent. Also I get rashes if my skin touches any of my allergies and my tongue feels like it is burning if I eat them.

My dad has an out of town guest who is staying for a few days. I don‚Äôt mind him staying in the guest bedroom. 

I didn‚Äôt have time to do meal prep over the weekend, so I asked my mom for a few meals, so I did not have to buy anything and I had something to tide me over for three days. My parents are divorced. She made me a week‚Äôs worth of food and extra for my dad. My boxes were clearly labeled and put to one side of the fridge. She also bought some takeout from a safe restaurant. 

Well, the guest ate some of my food and some of the raw tomatoes my dad had put in a box in the fridge for my use, yesterday while I was at work. So now, I don‚Äôt know what is safe and what is cross-contaminated. My dad doesn‚Äôt understand why I got angry about it.  He did offer to buy me some more food to replace but it is gonna be takeout. I wanted my mom‚Äôs cooking because I don‚Äôt get to eat it anymore that often, since it is rare that she cooks. My aunt brings her home cooked food every two weeks, since she is a doctor. He also thinks that I could cook the food on the stove and it would just be tomatoes cooking. He is right in that way, but I still think I am justified.

I did not tell my mom about the situation.

AITA for being cross with a guest about eating my food?

Edit: Our boxes were labeled with our individual names. Mine with my name. My dad‚Äôs with his name. It did not say Dad. It said his name. For context, our names start with the same letter.

My dad had some food made for him by my mom. The raw tomatoes were on the other side of the fridge in a drawer, completely separate. The guest was welcome to take from my dad‚Äôs boxes but definitely not mine. My dad made it clear that my boxes were off limits. Absolutely no touching my boxes because of my food allergies. I don‚Äôt know if my dad specified my allergies to the guest.

At work everyone is always bringing snacks and sweets, which I avoid for the most part. 
  This morning a coworker came to my desk with a large slice of cheesecake and I told her cheekily to get it away from me.

When she asked why I didn‚Äôt want it I replied by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get fat‚Äù. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I realized as soon as it came out how rude and blunt the statement was and I felt instant regret in my careless choice of words. The realization got worse when I remembered my coworker who works at the cubicle next to me is significantly overweight. 
   Our cubicles are tall so I couldn‚Äôt see her and it was so quiet I‚Äôm not even sure if she was at her desk. The coworker I was speaking to seemed to notice the panic I had on my face and played it off saying to just take it because she doesn‚Äôt like chocolate. Now I‚Äôve been ruminating and worrying about if my coworker heard it. She‚Äôs very sweet and I like her a lot and would never intentionally say anything to hurt her feelings.

Let me start off by saying I‚Äôm not sure if my coworker heard or not but either way I feel terrible. Recently I‚Äôve been trying to improve my life in all ways, I stopped drinking, started exercising more, and have made efforts to eat better. At work everyone is always bringing snacks and sweets, which I avoid for the most part. 
  This morning a coworker came to my desk with a large slice of cheesecake and I told her cheekily to get it away from me. Me and this coworker are able to mess around a bit with each other so there wasn‚Äôt any hostility during the conversation. When she asked why I didn‚Äôt want it I replied by saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to get fat‚Äù. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I realized as soon as it came out how rude and blunt the statement was and I felt instant regret in my careless choice of words. The realization got worse when I remembered my coworker who works at the cubicle next to me is significantly overweight. 
   Our cubicles are tall so I couldn‚Äôt see her and it was so quiet I‚Äôm not even sure if she was at her desk. The coworker I was speaking to seemed to notice the panic I had on my face and played it off saying to just take it because she doesn‚Äôt like chocolate. Now I‚Äôve been ruminating and worrying about if my coworker heard it. She‚Äôs very sweet and I like her a lot and would never intentionally say anything to hurt her feelings.

37,1fz2u86,WIBTA if I told my flatmates that I am unhappy that we are no longer hosting parties / moving away from being a flat that entertains people the way we used to?,"Hi

Context: I'm (29M)  living in a flat share in the centre of a major city. I have a flatshare with 3 other people, all of whom are a year or two younger. We are all working professionals. Out of the four of us, I have lived in the flat the longest.

We are very fortunate that the flat is both A: in quite a desirable, vibrant area of the city and B: is very large, suitable for hosting gatherings and parties (we even have a hot tub somehow). The previous tenants, both during my tenancy and I know prior to mine, were very up for hosting joint house parties in the space. The landlord who owns the space has even mentioned that he sort of expects us to use it this way. Yes it got a bit loud and they typically went quite late, but only at the weekend. I always gave a lot of grace to flatmates who got a bit loud during the week only because I would have appreciated the same treatment.

Two of the flatmates, who have been here for a couple of years, have got together in the last year or so though and turned into real homebodies. Make no mistake, I like them as people. The girl has done a lot to make the flat a 'nicer' place to live, she's decorated with art, added plants and the like.

But on the other hand, she has become somewhat hostile to the idea of these parties. I have had to seek permission in ways that just weren't the norm before - i'm fine with this, it's their home - but she's also sort of withdrawn any desire to participate herself which I feel just brings the vibe down. No longer are we jointly hosting a thing for all of our friends, it's me and the other guy at best. Her boyfriend is likely to just go along with her.

It's almost implicit now that we aren't going to have parties like we used to. I should also mention that a big catalyst for this was a party last year, where we hosted quite a large gathering of people and some folks, not in my group of friends but in one of theirs, invited their friends etc, and it got a bit out of control in terms of scale. Nothing untoward happened, but i think it caused her quite a lot of anxiety. We agreed we would scale it down, but it's just lead to this vibe shift now which I guess they are happy with, but I am not.

Would I be the asshole for explaining to them my feelings or trying to explain my perspective? I cannot reasonably expect anything to change, it's their home and I accept they have that veto, so at best I would just be acting selfishly by getting it 'off my chest', and risking upsetting the dynamic just for the sake of my own catharsis?",Asshole,2024-10-08,"WIBTA if I told my flatmates that I am unhappy that we are no longer hosting parties / moving away from being a flat that entertains people the way we used to?

38,1fz2t29,AITA for not listening to my friend constantly complain about video games?,"Hi all,
I play a notoriously toxic game called league of legends which is supposed to be a team game, but most of the time it‚Äôs not that. Iykyk

Sometimes I play with a buddy of mine that I have known for 12 years and he is a toxic player. Whenever we are on comms together I am just trying to have a good time and enjoy the game however he is either complaining about team mates being bad and actively flaming them in the chat or giving me unsolicited advice on how to play the game (we have been playing the same amount of time and are similar rank) as if I don‚Äôt know as much as him when it comes to this game. 

I am often just pretty accepting of his behaviour as I‚Äôve known him a long time and figured that this is who he is however it doesn‚Äôt make me feel good. I am a ‚Äúmute all‚Äù and play type of player.

I try to avoid conflict with him most of the time, because in his eyes nothing I say is ever valid, but whenever I try to bring up a mistake he has made in game he will often deflect it onto the rest of the team as to why his decision is correct and that it‚Äôs the teams fault that we are losing. He will rarely take ownership of his mistakes which is frustrating because if I make a mistake he will vocalise it pretty quickly, even though I immediately know when I‚Äôve messed up.

When he plays on his own and gets bad team mates that completely feed (die a lot in the game) he will often message me and tell me in detail how bad his team mates were and how he just can‚Äôt believe that these people are his games, as he is too good to be in this rank. Today he messaged me a whole essay twice about these teams he has been getting and it is getting old. I have always listened to him complain and tried to be there for him when he is obviously upset about his ranked experience. 

Tonight I gave him a taste of his own medicine when instead of listening to his woes of ranked games like I usually do I gave him some unsolicited advice and said he should just dodge if there is a bad team composition for the game he was about to play. No excuses for putting yourself in a game where your team is obviously about to troll you.

40,1fz1ygq,AITA for informing my son's friend's parents that he is a kleptomaniac?,"Hi son is 14M. He is a diagnosed kleptomaniac. He is in therapy for it. It used to be a huge problem but is now is mostly under control, even tho sometimes he can't help himself. He is a good kid, but he is quick to grab things without even being aware of it, and honestly he is very good with his hands, he is able to pickpocket without being caught in the act.

I don't want this to affect his social life, so when he visits someone else's homes, I try to talk to the parents to inform them that he has this condition, and if they think something is missing from their homes, they can call me and I will search for it in case my son had grabbed it.

Yes, some parents have called me and I've brought their things back, usually small things but important enough to need to be returned. However, some parents have forbidden their kids to hang out with my son after i've delivered it, and it's hard for him.

So, recently, he visited for the first time the home of a friend to play Warhammer. I informed the parents of his condition and I thought everything was ok. But while he was there, the parents told their son, and the son told the other kids there, and they bullied him to the point that my son left and walked alone to our home. Nobody called me, he has a phone but didn't call or text, he just got home on his own. Then he scolded me, saying that I'm ruining his life by telling everyone that he is a ""thief"" and he'll never make friends because I keep telling people. Then locked himself in his bedroom to cry.

Honestly I feel bad, but I think this is a way of telling other kid's parents that I'm not enabling my son. I know is hard but I'm doing what I can as a mom, but I wanna ask if I'm the asshole because seems to be hurting him anyway.

edit: People keep saying that I should rather search him, but I've already done that when he was younger.

He is not allowed to wear pants with pockets, he is not allowed to use bags or backpacks, and only has a small fully transparent one when he needs it. He carries his phone in a case strapped to his belt. In school the principal is allowed to get into his locker if he suspects he took something. I have an inventory of what belongs to him and what belongs to me. If he buys something, has to show me a recipe, and other measures. Someone just commented that I should strip search him.

I have a friend from college, let‚Äôs call her Kelly. We‚Äôve been out of school for a few years now and live in different states, but talk regularly and have been able to take a few trips to see each other over the years. Thanks to FaceTime, we talk face-to-face quite a bit (important).

Kelly is gorgeous, very conventionally attractive, but she has always been insecure about having thin lips. She talked here and there about trying filler, and I knew at some point she would as it became so common and socially acceptable. Filler isn‚Äôt for me (don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm vain too, I tape up my forehead while I sleep and all that) and she knows it‚Äôs not my style, but I never ever discouraged her from getting it, I never even did the whole ‚Äòoh but you don‚Äôt need it!‚Äô thing. Just stuck to ‚Äòoh cool‚Äô and moved on, it wasn‚Äôt something we talked about very much.

Fast forward and Kelly is getting married this winter, to a great guy and we‚Äôre all super happy for them. A few months ago while we were FaceTiming I couldn‚Äôt stop looking at how oddly her mouth was moving when she talked, and realized she had finally gotten filler. I didn‚Äôt say anything and just tried to avoid staring at her mouth when she talked.

I'm currently staying with my family as we've had a bereavement and haven't been home for about 6 days. As far as I was aware, my flatmate wasn't going on any trips while I'm away. A couple days ago I got a text from my neighbour asking me to tell my flatmate to move her car as he couldn't get out of our building's car park for work. I told him I wasn't home and asked what he meant and he facetimed me and showed me that my flatmate's car was in the space next to the entrance/exit and was sticking out so much that it blocked the entrance/exit more than halfway. Cars could not get in or out of the lot because of this and her car isn't a small car by any means, it's an SUV. I texted her asking her to move her car and she left me on read for hours. I texted her again during this time and was continuously left on read. My neighbour had to get a ride to work in the end.

Eventually, I got a reply from her; ""oh yeah I'm gonna be out for a few days."" That was it, she didn't mention anything about her car acknowledged my messages about her car. I told her she was obstructing the only way in or out of the car park and asked if she could call her sister, who has a spare set of keys to her car, and ask if she could come over and move the car. I was left on read for a few more hours until she responded ""she's sick"". She didn't respond to any of my following texts and sent me to voicemail when I called.

Yesterday, the same neighbour called me and told me he had called a tow truck because the car had not moved for days and was still obstructing the entrance/exit. I was pretty pissed with my flatmate and her lack of care for other people and told him to go ahead and let him tow the car. This morning, I got a bunch of angry texts from my flatmate cursing me out and calling me every name under the sun. When she was dropped home this morning, my neighbour happened to be out front and when she saw her car was gone, he explained the situation and that I'd told him to go ahead with towing her car. I now feel bad because her car was her only way to get to work but she was fine to let other people not be able to drive to their work for days. Our friends are saying I could have come home early, picked up the spare keys from her sister and moved it myself but I can't leave my family during a really tough time.

I was left on read for a few more hours until she responded ""she's sick"". She didn't respond to any of my following texts and sent me to voicemail when I called.

Yesterday, the same neighbour called me and told me he had called a tow truck because the car had not moved for days and was still obstructing the entrance/exit. I was pretty pissed with my flatmate and her lack of care for other people and told him to go ahead and let him tow the car. This morning, I got a bunch of angry texts from my flatmate cursing me out and calling me every name under the sun. When she was dropped home this morning, my neighbour happened to be out front and when she saw her car was gone, he explained the situation and that I'd told him to go ahead with towing her car. I now feel bad because her car was her only way to get to work but she was fine to let other people not be able to drive to their work for days. Our friends are saying I could have come home early, picked up the spare keys from her sister and moved it myself but I can't leave my family during a really tough time. AITA for letting her car get towed?

Katty came to me and said she feels like it‚Äôs unfair we celebrate Jake, and I decided to have a conversation with her. I sat her down and explained that we love her just as much, but if she wants to be celebrated like Jake, she needs to put effort into something. I suggested she try finding something she‚Äôs passionate about or work harder in school. That she should make her own goals to work towards. I thought I was being honest but gentle.

Katty did not take it well. She exploded, accusing me of playing favorites and said it was unfair that Jake gets all the attention just because he‚Äôs always doing things. She even lashed out at Jake, telling him that he was ‚Äúthe golden child‚Äù and she was tired of hearing about how great he was.

Jake was hurt by her outburst, and now things are awkward between them. Katty has been avoiding both me and her brother since then, staying in her room or giving us the silent treatment.

But she had me (16m) first. I have seen photos and videos of the day I was born. She cried hysterically when they told her I was a boy. Then she refused to hold me. After we were cleaned up she cried about not using the name she had chosen and said she didn't know how to move on from it. All this was caught on camera. Eventually my paternal grandma took me and she was the person to hold me in photos and videos taken during the rest of our hospital stay.

My paternal grandma was my sole parent figure for the first 8 years of my life. She took care of me and I spent so much time at her house. Sometimes I was there for weeks. Then she had a brain bleed and died. So I was left with a mom who wanted girls and not a boy and a dad who wanted to be a provider and nothing more.

My mom had my sister ""Lily"" two years after me. So mom got her girl and Lily got all her attention. While I got grandma until I was 8 and then nobody. 

My mom and Lily are super close and mom adores Lily. Lily got the bigger bedroom, she gets the gifts, she gets all her favorite snacks, she gets to do all the extra curricular activities she could ever want and her birthdays are huge parties with huge gifts. Christmas she gets at minimum? 25 gifts from mom alone. Mom typically gets me one... never anything I'd like or want but you know, thought that counts (which is zero).

My mom's family don't act too interested in making up for my lack of parental love. And in the last couple of years mom and I have argued more and I give her a hard time.

Mom has mentioned how I ruined her dream of four daughters.

We were at mom's parents house Friday and mom gushed about Lily doing good on a project and the scooter she got Lily to help her get around easier. She got Lily a custom helmet and a personalized lock for her scooter. She couldn't stop talking about it and I told her she really does love to shower her favorite in gifts and praise.

47,1fz0x2u,AITA for calling my friend out on her Autism obsession?,"I (FTM 20) have recently been released out of a stationary clinic. There I met Sam(fake name) (MTF 25). We had similar interests and I was trying to fight my social anxiety so I tried to start talking, hanging out, etc.

We were talking about our art, interests and current projects. I knew Sam was trying to get an Autism diagnosis in the clinic as she has been denied previously by her psychiatrist. We had a talk about how it's difficult to get a diagnosis as an adult. I personally have had tests done at 17 where I have been diagnosed with ADHD and tendencies to autism. But I never got a full diagnosis. 

Now this happened about two months ago now so I'm paraphrasing a bit. 
During her stay Sam was very angry with the doctors, calling them ridiculous and demanding a second opinion. Once her test came back negative she 'rage quit' and said she'd go to someone else. Which she hasn't done to this day according to what she told me in our conversation today. Claiming that it took a toll on her and that she is now seeing a therapist who ALSO doesn't think she has autism.

I'm a very rational thinker and I'm not one to indulge delusional behaviour, but I also wanted to smooth things over, calm her down? I tried to be reasonable and told her that she may, like me, experience tendencies and it doesn't have to be full blown autism. To which she claimed in being frustrated with having to deal with replies like mine and how I'm not being 'helpful' at all. She continued saying that she is done being called 'not autistic enough' because her stimming and special interests don't revolve around cars or numbers. She said that autism doesn't have tendencies and is a 'yes or no' type spectrum. So she doesn't believe in that. ALSO, this is a quote: 'All my friends are autistic and have been diagnosed... so...' which is literally irrelevant and not a valid argument in my oppinion. Plus according to her of course having the diagnosis comes with many legal benefits at work and free transportation. But when I told her that stimming isn't inherently an autistic trait, she said she felt triggered so I apologised and left it at that. 

I was unsure wether I said the right thing, wether perhaps I was being ableist or insensitive, so I asked one of my friends. My friend K (27) also agreed that it felt off and very 'chronically online'. And that it doesn't make sense to fight with professionals who have years of medical studies behind them. None of the people she has seen so far have seen that she has autism(I dont remember how many people it was).

I felt uncomfortable so I have sent her a last message.I mentioned some things I already said in the post and then I told her to speak to a professional but to actually listen and stop being stubborn just because someone disagrees with her. I wished her good luck with her art and said that I'd like to leave our contact at that. She then unfriended me.

Basically, my moms surname has made it so I am the only person in the world with my combination of names, and I still would be if I only use her name. If I only used my dads surname, there would be hundreds, maybe thousands with the same name.

Recently i have been trying to brand myself on linkedIn, and i have made my own website. I have finished my degree and I want a job in marketing, preferebly something creative. I am trying to network and make people remember my name, which is why I like it short and easy to remember.

This decision to only use one surname is logical and based off of the word in itself. It is not based on how much i love each parent. And I am not going to change it legaly. Even if I get married or something, my name stays the same on paper, because I love it. 

Now my dad feels hurt by this. He says that his surname is good and he doesn't understand why I want to act like it doesn't exist. My mom also has his surname from the mariage, but my dad didn't take my moms. So he feels his name is much more the family name than my moms. 

I don't act like it doesn't exist. I just don't use it in a professional context. 

Even though I feel like this is a stupid disagreement, I don't like to hurt my dad, and I don't want him to feel like I am ashamed of the name or something. I love his name, because it has been passed down from many generations of farmers, and I love the combinations of names i have.

50,1fz02b6,AITA for not defending my friend when she was called a slut and saying she was a bad friend?,"I (21f) have been friends with a girl named Maylie (22f) for 2 years. This week, our whole friend group (5 girls) went out for drinks and later went to a club. I don't drink a lot, but some of my friends do. That night, one of them, Tara (21f), met a guy who invited her to go to all of the bars in the street with him and his friends. Since there were other women with them and Tara told us she was okay, we let her go with them and stayed inside the club. 

When it was time for us to go, we went looking for Tara because we had all agreed to leave together. But we didn't in what bar she was and her phone had died, so the 4 of us decided to split up and each go to a bar or two to see if she was there. We all went to a different bar, but after a while Maylie stopped replying to our messages. We waited for a bit and kept looking in other places, but after 30 minutes she was still not replying. 

So we all decided to go to the bar where Maylie was supposed to go, and there we were told by some guys that she left with one of their friends to go back to his place. The thing is, we always agreed that when we went out together we went home together, and we never went back to a guy's place, especially not without telling the others. Plus, we later found out that Tara was in that same bar, and she wasn't doing well because she had drunk a lot. 

The next day, when Maylie finally replied to our texts, Tara and another of our friends told her that what she did was wrong and kind of yelled at her, and it ended with the other friend telling Maylie that she ""was too busy being a slut to care about her friend"". I never replied to the texts, but honestly they were right, what Maylie did was very wrong I think. 

After that, Maylie texted me saying that I was mean for not defending her when the others were slutshaming her, and that ""as a friend and as a woman I shouldn't be okay with them saying that"". I told her that ""as a friend and a woman, she should've helped her friend instead of leaving to fuck some random guy she had barely met"" and said that she was a bad friend for putting that above finding her friend. She got really mad at me and doesn't speak to any of us anymore. 

Maybe what we said was mean, and I realize now that I used pretty strong words, but at the same time I was so angry that she didn't care about finding her friend more than sex. And I don't think calling someone a slut is ever right, but I didn't intervene because I felt like ultimately my friends were right to be angry. Am I an AH for that?

Plus, we later found out that Tara was in that same bar, and she wasn't doing well because she had drunk a lot. 

The next day, when Maylie finally replied to our texts, Tara and another of our friends told her that what she did was wrong and kind of yelled at her, and it ended with the other friend telling Maylie that she ""was too busy being a slut to care about her friend"". I never replied to the texts, but honestly they were right, what Maylie did was very wrong I think. 

After that, Maylie texted me saying that I was mean for not defending her when the others were slutshaming her, and that ""as a friend and as a woman I shouldn't be okay with them saying that"". I told her that ""as a friend and a woman, she should've helped her friend instead of leaving to fuck some random guy she had barely met"" and said that she was a bad friend for putting that above finding her friend. She got really mad at me and doesn't speak to any of us anymore. 

Maybe what we said was mean, and I realize now that I used pretty strong words, but at the same time I was so angry that she didn't care about finding her friend more than sex. And I don't think calling someone a slut is ever right, but I didn't intervene because I felt like ultimately my friends were right to be angry. Am I an AH for that? ",1.0,1.0153824,1,1
51,1fyzyn4,AITA for refusing to move out of my parent's home?,"Throwaway account, changed name.

I live in my parent's home, lived here my whole life, and have no desire to leave. Two years ago, my dad passed away unexpectedly. Not long after, my mom (who's mentally unfit) was moved into a care facility. Since then, I‚Äôve been living at home by myself.

Recently, my mom's court appointed guardian, John, sent me a letter that I will need to move out soon because he's selling the house.

Now, I‚Äôve told John multiple times that I could care for my mom at home. It would have been a win-win situation. The house wouldn't need to be sold off and John would have been paying a fraction of what the facility costs to pay me to be my mom's caregiver. But John always turned me down, saying that my mom is better off in the facility. His decision has added a lot of unneeded stress to my life, as I‚Äôm currently finishing my degree and working at the same time. Basically every paycheck is being used on school, car payments, and groceries--I can't even afford to move out. 

So I've decided to ignore the letter and stay past the move out date. I believe I have rights to remain in the house and could fight back in court. Honestly I think John managed things wrong and I could get him in trouble--especially after I explain to the judge that this whole situation could have been avoided. However, some of my friends think I'm TA for not preparing for this day sooner, and essentially I'm wasting money that should have gone to my mom's care.

52,1fyzdnr,AITA for intervening in my mums livestream?,"I'm 16 years old and living in New Zealand, and I'm currently dealing with a complicated family situation that has left me feeling lost and overwhelmed. 

My mom has always been caring and involved in my life. She took me to school and cheered me on at my netball practices. However, everything shifted when she had weight loss surgery when I was 11. After the surgery, she transformed into a different person. She was supposed to take vitamin supplements for her health, but her neglect of them severely impacted her mental well-being. She lost her motivation and began distancing herself from me and the entire family.

Growing up, I saw my parents argue frequently, but there were also loving moments between them. My dad expressed his actions while my mom craved physical & words of affirmations , which often led to conflicts. My dad has consistently been there for me, even during tough times, but my mom's emotional availability changed greatly, making her more of a friend than a parent.

Over time, her drinking worsened, particularly after her stepfather's death. Our family has a legacy of heavy drinking, which often results in conflicts. The night of the funeral was a turning point; we had to step in to protect her from spiraling further into her grief. This led to a pattern of daily drinking, during which she frequently blamed my dad for being overbearing. While my father has always looked out for us, my mother painted him in a negative light.

The situation deteriorated when she became involved with an app called Bigo, where she engaged in reckless and flirtatious behavior while live streaming. Rather than seeking the help she needed, she turned her grief inward and became even more distant from us. It all came to a head when she admitted to having an affair through Bigo. AITA for this?

Now, I witness her continued heavy drinking and drug use through her lives that she does in Australia, which breaks my heart.

53,1fyzccy,AITA for telling my roommate that she is not allowed to leave her partner in the house unattended? ,"Me and my roommates (five of us total) moved into a four bedroom house 2 months ago (four of us 25F, and one 25M). The four others lived together for 2-3 years, while I lived alone for that time. Their house was not rent controlled (Ontario) and the landlord was going to double their rent, and I was tired of paying $2400 per month as a graduate student, so we all decided to move into a 3-story, 4-bedroom house. We have known each other since first year of university, and two of the girls (let‚Äôs call them Rebecca and Dani) are long-term partners, so they share one room. 

About 3 months ago, before I lived with them, Macy (the third girl) started dating a girl named  Carol. I found out from Rebecca and Dani that Macy had let Carol (who Macy had known for two weeks) stay in their apartment alone for a few hours, and when Rebecca and Dani arrived at home, they found their door wide open. Macy also gave Carol the key code to enter their apartment. 

Since I moved in with them, Carol is often at our house and it‚Äôs starting to feel like we have a sixth roommate. Macy has let Carol cook in the kitchen, take Zoom calls in the dining room, and change into different outfits in the living room, all while Macy is somewhere else in the house. 

Yesterday, Macy let Carol stay at our house while Macy left for four hours. Rebecca, Dani, and I felt uncomfortable with this, as Carol is basically a stranger to us. Carol stayed in Macy‚Äôs room the majority of the time, but she did use our kitchen briefly. 

We told Macy that we were uncomfortable with this, but she told us we were being unreasonable. She said she pays for her room so she should be able to use it however she wants, and that includes leaving guests alone in her room while she is out of the house. We told her that since three of us (the majority) are uncomfortable with guests being unattended in the house that she is not allowed to leave Carol alone in her room, and that we would submit official complaints to the landlord if she does it again. 

Macy is upset with us because she thinks we are being unreasonable, so her and Carol have left to stay at Carol‚Äôs apartment for a few days (Carol has one roommate if that‚Äôs relevant). We think that it‚Äôs unfair to leave a stranger alone in our home - what if we had to leave the house while Carol was in our home without Macy? I have valuables and private items in my room that I don‚Äôt want a guest to find, and Carol already has a history of snooping. It‚Äôs also uncomfortable to find a guest using your kitchen as if it‚Äôs theirs, or just coming home to what you believe is an empty house to find a surprise guest alone in your house.

We haven't spoken since and then this morning he asks me something unrelated super casual and I totally blew up. I said I couldn‚Äôt believe he hasn‚Äôt even tried to have a conversation about The Call. And he says actually I should apologize for interrupting. I said I‚Äôm not waiting on an apology but an explanation especially given everything that happened a few months ago.

57,1fyyq0n,AITA for not getting my sil a gift from Marrakech,"I 26f went with my husband 26m and our 1.5yr old son on my first holiday abroad for a hectic 3 days.
First day was a tour of some of the market (about 5 hrs), 2nd atlas mountains (8am to 6pm), last I was ill with fever and diarrhea. 
We only brought hand luggage each which was already packed, my husband paying for everything, we didn't have enough left for a taxi to the airport.
We did get some gifts:
His mum,4 yr old nephew.
My mum,nan,twin sister.
He also bought for himself & me.
To me a trip shouldn't be worrying about gifts, it was my first passport, trip abroad too. My mum and nan told me off for worrying about gifts, even then I was worrying about his sil because we are abit close, but I figured I'll leave that to him, it's only his mum and nephew he got something for in the end so I thought it's fine, if we got something for her then we would have to for his bro and wife (the only other girl, nephews mum & dad).

We get back, I'm ill, son was tired and going crazy for hours, backs killing, next couple days she comes round after trip, brings me a funny souvenir of the mona lisa doing a dab, then asks where's her gift, I said we didn't get anything, it was already a push, just got things for our mums, my nan and my twin, she becomes cold and wants to leave, her mum makes her stay and says don't do that you'll upset her (me), I'm in shock and quiet and she says I deserve to feel bad. Later that night I'm hysterically crying shocked and confused feeling so bad. She messages during that time saying she's heartbroken because she always makes sure to get me something, I explain what I said above and she doesn't say anything about it just she understands but it hurts when you're forgotten about and she just had to let it out to me, and that was it.
Since then I cried for days, after a high of the trip it crashed fast and now it has negativity to it.

To add:
Apparently she thought we got something for her bro too and my husband is quite blunt and jokey and said we just forgot about her which didn't help. I did explain in the text that wasn't the case.
She's been on quite a few trips, came back and going again soon, she does come with gifts for everyone.
I did consider her close, sought comfort on text for things (before trip) she responded once then never responded to my msgs after, (not the type to ignore but I guess busy and forgot). Hurt and after that I did distance myself abit.
I'm a big introvert, I only spend time with my mum and sister if that.
She's a good person with good intentions all be it maybe sensitive and blunt sometimes.
If we didn't have our son I most likely would've been able to focus on the gifts more, when we got what we got it was a quick decision and go thing and my husband was leading it except my nans scarf I asked for.

We get back, I'm ill, son was tired and going crazy for hours, backs killing, next couple days she comes round after trip, brings me a funny souvenir of the mona lisa doing a dab, then asks where's her gift, I said we didn't get anything, it was already a push, just got things for our mums, my nan and my twin, she becomes cold and wants to leave, her mum makes her stay and says don't do that you'll upset her (me), I'm in shock and quiet and she says I deserve to feel bad. Later that night I'm hysterically crying shocked and confused feeling so bad. She messages during that time saying she's heartbroken because she always makes sure to get me something, I explain what I said above and she doesn't say anything about it just she understands but it hurts when you're forgotten about and she just had to let it out to me, and that was it.
Since then I cried for days, after a high of the trip it crashed fast and now it has negativity to it.

To add:
Apparently she thought we got something for her bro too and my husband is quite blunt and jokey and said we just forgot about her which didn't help. I did explain in the text that wasn't the case.
She's been on quite a few trips, came back and going again soon, she does come with gifts for everyone.
I did consider her close, sought comfort on text for things (before trip) she responded once then never responded to my msgs after, (not the type to ignore but I guess busy and forgot). Hurt and after that I did distance myself abit.
I'm a big introvert, I only spend time with my mum and sister if that.
She's a good person with good intentions all be it maybe sensitive and blunt sometimes.
If we didn't have our son I most likely would've been able to focus on the gifts more, when we got what we got it was a quick decision and go thing and my husband was leading it except my nans scarf I asked for.

58,1fyymsp,AITA for refusing to let my friend sit in my seat?,"So I (16F) sit in the same spot every morning for breakfast. Our lunchroom doesn‚Äôt have assigned seating, but all students generally sit at the same tables. I‚Äôm neurodivergent (diagnosed, of course), and one of my only pet peeves is having to move out of places where I usually sit. Teachers who constantly change their seating arrangements are the bane of my existence. For example, a few weeks ago, one of my close friends was sitting in my breakfast spot out of nowhere and it soured my mood for hours. I didn‚Äôt say anything to her because I didn‚Äôt want to be rude or start drama, and because I care about her a lot.

So one of my friends asked if he could sit in my seat this morning. I wasn‚Äôt sure, because part of me wanted to be nice and say yes and the other was freaking out internally. If the issue were that he didn‚Äôt have a seat I‚Äôd have said yes in a heartbeat, but he already had a seat (the one he always sits in) and had no actual reason for wanting the change other than just wanting to switch.

I politely said I wasn‚Äôt really comfortable with moving and that I‚Äôd rather we just stay where we were, which made him upset. He said I was acting ridiculous and that being autistic isn‚Äôt an excuse to be stingy. I felt bad but stuck by what I said, and now he‚Äôs making it into a bigger deal.

This is literally the one single thing I care about when it comes to structure; I‚Äôm usually a big fan of changing things up and I just go with the flow. I just literally hate moving seats.

59,1fyym24,AITA for accusing mom of being selfish when she forces my twin sister's dad to include me?,"You read that right my twin sister (16f) and I (16m) don't have the same dad. Mom slept with two guys close together and had us. DNA proved this too. It's always been a weird thing and we get a lot of questions irl. My sister's dad was willing to do the DNA test, took it and it showed he was her dad but not mine. Mine had to be dragged to court and he has found ways around paying for me and he and his family never wanted to know me. So my sister grew up with a dad and I didn't.

Mom didn't like it and when we were young (3 to 5 maybe) I apparently used to get so sad when she'd leave and go to her dad's house and I couldn't go with her. I don't remember it but I get why it'd be true. So mom told him he had to include me and he was like nope, no way. It ended up in court with mom wanting to take away his parenting time. The judge ended up saying he didn't have to take me for his custody time but he had to include me in any big days out with my sister or for family holidays if she went along. He tried to get my mom to drop it but she refused.

So ever since I about 5 or 6 he has been forced to include me in his life sometimes and the lives of his family members. None of them want me there. I know they see me as this huge burden. I hated it. If I wasn't being ignored they were just really short with me and made it so obvious they didn't want me there. My sister was torn between me and her dad. I told her I didn't want to deny her a dad. So she never let it come between them or us.

When I turned 13 I tried to put my foot down with mom but she told me I had to go and she said she'd take his ass to court so fast if he let me wander off and didn't make sure I was okay like he would with my sister.

There's only two years left but I can see how much my sister's paternal side despise having me around. It sucks being forced somewhere that nobody wants you. And my mom is still serious about taking him back to court. So I told mom a couple of nights ago that it needs to stop and she can't keep doing this. She told me I don't deserve to be left out because of her actions. I told her she can't make them love me and they have shown their distain for me for over 10 years now. I told her to let it go.

When I started college, I had to move out since my family lives too far from any college to commute. I was on a government grant, receiving ‚Ç¨150 every two weeks, but it was tough to manage.

Meanwhile, my mom was receiving ‚Ç¨150 a week in child support for me and another ‚Ç¨150 for my younger brother, but I didn‚Äôt get any financial support from her. Balancing work and school became overwhelming, and this year I had to drop out because my grant was denied due to higher earnings, rent prices increased, and I couldn‚Äôt keep up with working 45-hour weeks plus 25 hours of classes.

Now, I‚Äôm back living with my mom, working full-time and saving as much as I can. My mom is nearly 50 and works as a bartender like me, but she only does 20 hours a week, claiming she‚Äôs too old for more. While I‚Äôm working 50+ hours, she feels entitled to my earnings. She drinks and smokes weed daily, and even though she owns the house outright and has 6 acres of land, she complains she doesn‚Äôt have money to turn it into a BnB like she planned. She built a cabin but lets her boyfriend live there rent-free, and sometimes even gives him money for drinks or smokes.

The house is falling apart‚Äîthere are rats in the walls, and when I returned, my bedroom was in terrible shape. There was no bed frame, black mold under the mattress, and a filthy carpet. I had to buy a new bed frame, mattress, and carpet with my own money, but my mom complained that I had enough disposable income to afford those things.

Now, she‚Äôs asking me for ‚Ç¨100-150 a week in rent, which I feel is unfair. She refuses to work more hours, gave her BnB away rent-free, and let the house deteriorate while I wasn‚Äôt living here. I already cover all my own food, laundry, and personal expenses, and contribute minimally to household costs like utilities. I don‚Äôt mind helping her out, but I think asking for that much rent is unreasonable given the situation. Am I wrong for not wanting to pay it? Or at least not in cash?

It‚Äôs very difficult for me to just leave as I have a 14 year old brother who frankly if I don‚Äôt make sure he doesn‚Äôt get into trouble my mom just leaves him to his own devices, he misses a lot of school and has had a couple run ins with the cops, she feeds him and cares about him but she‚Äôs just not responsible enough to parent him right now. 

She wasn‚Äôt always like this, my dad basically stripped her of all her life‚Äôs work and worth and left her with very little money or prospects and since then she‚Äôs delved much deeper into her vices and insecurities 

Note: I didn‚Äôt receive any  of the child support she was getting for me from my dad despite being a child in need of support while living alone trying to get an education at college, the total of the child support that I didn‚Äôt see a cent of would be roughly 12000 euros or 13000 dollars


Edit: a reason for this may be because she is no longer receiving 150 a week from my dad as I am no longer attending college, which has probably put a financial strain on her.

Edit part 2: my dad divorced my mom took me and my brother off his will, sold his businesses and left the country after cutting ties with me and my family, my mom is currently in a legal dispute over the sale of businesses as she saw nothing from them despite contributing largely to them

Edit: a reason for this may be because she is no longer receiving 150 a week from my dad as I am no longer attending college, which has probably put a financial strain on her.

Edit part 2: my dad divorced my mom took me and my brother off his will, sold his businesses and left the country after cutting ties with me and my family, my mom is currently in a legal dispute over the sale of businesses as she saw nothing from them despite contributing largely to them

So no my dads help is not an option

70,1fyvmmw,AITA for refusing to let my neighbor take back the dog they abandoned?,"

Throwaway for privacy. 


TL;DR at the bottom. 

I (28F) live in a pretty quiet neighborhood and have always loved animals. About six months ago, my next-door neighbors, ""Mark"" and ""Julie,"" moved out of their house and completely abandoned their dog, ""Buddy"" (a 4-year-old Golden Retriever). They didn‚Äôt say a word about it‚Äîjust left him tied up in the backyard with a bag of food and water.

When I realized what had happened, I was furious. Who leaves a dog behind like that? I immediately took Buddy in and made sure he was safe and fed. Over the next few days, I tried contacting Mark and Julie to find out what was going on. They ignored all my calls and texts, so I figured they didn‚Äôt care and had intentionally left Buddy behind.

I ended up deciding to keep him. Buddy is the sweetest dog I‚Äôve ever met, and he quickly became a huge part of my life. I took him to the vet, got him vaccinated, and made sure he was healthy. It‚Äôs been six months, and he‚Äôs like family to me now. He‚Äôs happy, healthy, and honestly living his best life.

Then, last week, Mark randomly showed up at my door, saying they ""wanted Buddy back."" Apparently, they had some personal issues and had to leave town quickly, but now that things had settled, they were ready to bring him home. I was shocked. I told Mark there was no way I was giving Buddy back after they abandoned him for six months without any contact.

Mark got really defensive, saying that Buddy was their dog, and I had ""stolen"" him. He accused me of taking advantage of their situation and guilt-tripped me by saying that he and Julie had just been going through a tough time and needed a fresh start. He claimed that Buddy was ""better off with them"" since he‚Äôs their dog, and they had raised him for years.

I told him straight up that Buddy was staying with me. If they cared so much about him, they wouldn‚Äôt have left him behind like he was nothing. I reminded him that I had spent time and money taking care of Buddy when they couldn‚Äôt be bothered to even let me know what was going on. I told him that Buddy has a new home now and that I wasn‚Äôt about to uproot him just because they suddenly decided they wanted to play the responsible pet owners again.

Now, Mark and Julie are furious. They‚Äôve been going around the neighborhood, telling people I ""stole"" their dog and that I‚Äôm a terrible person for not giving him back. FYI they're living at a hotel and will leave sometime this week. 

I feel like I‚Äôm doing the right thing by keeping Buddy, but AITAH?

73,1fyuqpm,AITA for not asking my mom to help me with my kids ,"I (25f) just had my second baby eight weeks ago. My mom has been getting on my case about not asking her for help with the baby, but her idea of help is taking my kids away from me and I don‚Äôt need that kind of help. My son (4) loves going to her house so I let him once a week, but my parents have been coaching him to ask for sleepovers. For context, my husband and I aren‚Äôt comfortable with our son having sleepovers yet as we feel he is still too little to sleep away from home. But now our son will ask us to ‚Äústay the night at nana and pops house‚Äù because they bring it up to HIM all the time. It puts us in a weird spot, and my dad told me ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to keep asking until you guys relent.‚Äù 

Also, my mom is very passive aggressive by nature and if I mention anything about lack of sleep or the new baby being colicky, she immediately jumps down my throat with ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you ever ask me for help? I can‚Äôt beg you to ask me for help. You need to ask me, I want to help her wish you‚Äôd understand that.‚Äù And she screenshot a picture that my father in law posted of him holding the new baby a few days ago when they came for a visit demanding to know when the picture was taken because she was upset that I might have asked my in laws for help before I asked her. 

For some background, we asked our in laws to watch our son when we gave birth to our newest baby because my mother in law doesn‚Äôt work, and my mom does work, so my mother in law had a more flexible schedule since labor is usually spontaneous. My mom was really upset about this and made my entire birth about how upset she was that my in laws ‚Äúgot to watch‚Äù our son and ‚Äúwe didn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs not fair to us and we feel left out.‚Äù 

My parents are more on the self centered side, but also really love their grandkids and want to have them all the time to the point where it‚Äôs suffocating/overstepping.

I F20 live with my mum alone, I have been miserable living here and cannot wait until the day i can move out.

So basically, I‚Äôm technically unemployed at the moment, I have filed myself as self-employed as i have been strugggling to find a permanent job, so I have signed up for agencies to work in spas, and am also trying to get universal credit to help the extra bit.
I had a permanent part time job while I studied beauty in college, and when i first got that job, my mum would make everything extremely awkward, she received benefits as i was classed as dependent still in full time education, but those benefits would stop if i went over 22 hours a week, which i had no intention on.

On the other hand, my dad got me a card that said congratulations on the new job, which was my first. 

So i got the job in april, got made redundant in july, and I was like okay, i‚Äôll find another one, but my mum said it would be easier to wait until august as that‚Äôs when her benefits stop and my hours won‚Äôt affect her anymore. so I did, but I have struggled to find one, and been quite demotivated about it.

I agreed to contribute ¬£200 a month every month to help with bills and stuff starting november. 

My dad now has an apartment in spain as he needs it for work and has said if i wanted to come for a nice little holiday in november, he said he‚Äôd pay for the flights and i‚Äôd stay there for free obviously, for maybe a few days or week.

I mentioned this to my mum saying i might go to spain in november for a few days or a week, and she got angry, saying that i need to focus on getting more hours and a proper job because i‚Äôve only done one day so far and blah blah blah, that i might not get universal credit if i go on holiday, I‚Äôve already been on holiday twice this year and i don‚Äôt need to go on another one.

I mentioned trying to do 3 or 4 days a week and she mentioned i might get burnt out, and i agreed. I was hoping to get around 1000 a month 200 to my mum and the rest for me, i don‚Äôt really spend that much money so i‚Äôd save it.
 she says i‚Äôm not taking my career seriously, and if i go on holiday i‚Äôd have to pay her ¬£100 as I‚Äôm not contributing or whatever. She already came and told me that she not gonna cook anymore so id owe her less, and i can‚Äôt take the vitamins she has anymore because i don‚Äôt pay for them.

It‚Äôs 8 in the morning and i woke up at 6:30 to guess what? her making loud noises passive aggressively, using a blender, turning the lights one, turning the taps on super loudly, sighing, moving so loudly. 

  I‚Äôm so tired of being perceived as this monster, she claims i have a personality disorder and blah blah, i‚Äôm just tired, and I feel like i should just keep my mouth shut because anything involving my dad she goes haywire.

75,1fyuaq8,WIBTA for refusing to buy hoover add-ons for my cleaner?,"Context: I've just hired a cleaner and she came to my house for the first time yesterday. Immediately,  she was a LOT as a person. She constantly bragged about how good she was as a cleaner (and at the 9 other businesses she apparently runs) and also trauma dumped about her abusive husband. She Immediately said she couldn't do anything in the 2 hours I had booked, and said she would need at least 4 hours, which I agreed to (my house hasn't been cleaned in several months owing to me having a baby). She then didn't like the cleaning products I had, and had not brought any herself, so sent me to the shops to buy more cleaning products for her to use. She also insisted on having the heating on because the cold makes her ill (I normally keep my house at 17-18 degrees C). She also did not check whether anything was dishwasher safe before putting it in the dishwasher and ended up ruining a couple of water bottles that shrank.


The point I'm making is this was already quite a bit more expensive than I had been anticipating. I'm on maternity leave and not flush with money. She then told me that my hoover was missing a part that could extend it to make the pipe bit taller, and I needed to buy that because she has sciatica and can't bend down at all to hoover. I looked it up and to buy a replacement pipe for the hoover is ¬£44. I want to say no, as this has already cost more than I thought, and the hoover is perfectly functional as is (I have never had an issue with it). But I don't want to be an asshole who forces their cleaner to be in extreme pain because they won't spend ¬£44. Wibta for saying no?


Update: I've read all the comments and the verdict seems to be that I should get a new cleaner.

Now, my sister and I are huge Toronto Blue Jays fans. We love going to games. Both home and away. So‚Ä¶we are planning on going to an away game at the end of June. However it‚Äôs the same weekend as the wedding. 

I don‚Äôt feel bad about not going, but my mom (it‚Äôs my dad‚Äôs side. My mom‚Äôs side of the family is super close and we all love each other) is trying to guilt my sister and I into going.

83,1fytafx,WIBTA - If I Broke My Promise To Go Camping With my Friend For His B-Day?,"I'm 35F, have back problems that go from about a 3 on a good day to off-the-charts excruciating pain on the worst days. If you've ever had siatica pain, yeah...that's about where I am all day on a bad day. I see a chiropractor about this and she is the only reason I ever have days that are a '3'.

I am also one of those people who do NOT handle bugs. I run for my life from almost all, and will not sleep in a room that I know has a bug in it. I've slept in the living room when there was a ladybug in my room, and lost track of it when trying to get it out. Same with a cranefly. Those f\*ckers, along with all spiders and moths, put me in full panic mode.

I live with my aging mom, who sometimes has falls and needs help

I also don't drive

The situation: Last year(and for many years previous) my friend Tofu(35M) has been asking me to join him and his friends on a camping trip in the middle of May (a time of lots of bugs). I've dodged previously by siting my paralyzing fear of bugs, among other things. COVID got me out of it without much effort for 2020-2022, and he works in film so the writer's strike had him cancelling 2023.

Now, when he was planning his 2024 trip I had 'incidentally' planned a trip with my best friend to go to the local island. (It honestly was one of the few best times to go when considering hotel costs, weather, and how busy the area can get with tourists). Regardless, when he grumbled I eventually said I would go in 2025. He grumbled a bit more, but relented.

Well, now it's October and I need to start applying for 2025 vacation. And I'm so not wanting to go because I don't like the bugs, the sleeping arrangements will very likely ruin my back, it will take me using about 25% of my allowed vacation for the year, and I don't like leaving my mom for so long (Tofu is planning for 11 days total). Also, in general, he goes camping so he can play board games and magic. My brain is thinking...buddy...we can drive to a lake on your b day and do board games...why do we need 11 days out with the bugs? He won't be hiking, biking, or swimming...he'll be board gaming and cooking and smoring. That's it. It's just not my jam, but he gets very hurt when people opt out, and takes it as a personal affront. I also won't know anyone else going as everyone else are his coworkers.

Clarification: My 'dodging' in previous years has been accompanied by me saying, no, I don't want to, and explaining all the reasons. Tofu has always responded by making me feel like a bad friend for opting out of a birthday thing.

TL:DR: After years of telling my friend no, I promised to go with him and his friends on an 11 day camping trip next year for his b day. I hate bugs, have a bad back, have an elderly mother I'd be leaving alone, and don't drive, So, I really don't want to go.

85,1fysy22,AITA for telling my MIL I don‚Äôt want her around my wife anymore? ,"I'm 31m, married to my wife (28) for 8 years. We have 3 kids and she's currently pregnant with our fourth.

For context, my wife's mom and dad are divorced and both remarried long ago. FIL, stepmom, stepdad are all great.

The issue is her mother. My wife is an only child and her mother is overbearing to the point it stresses my wife out incredibly. She tries to FaceTime my wife and the kids every night for 2+ hours at a time despite knowing my wife (SAHM) has things to do. MIL will get upset if my wife can't text her all day about what she's doing and if she can't sit and talk at night. When our kids are on breaks, she expects them to spend every single day of it at her house (6 hours away) and gets mad and says my wife is doing the kids wrong by not letting them spend time with their grandparents. But when my wife DOES, MIL constantly acts like she's a bad mom, and I'm a bad husband and dad in general.

Last week, my wife had a pregnancy scare. She ended up in the hospital for three days, and didn‚Äôt text her mom back. MIL decided to message someone I work with on Facebook. He didn‚Äôt respond. So she messaged his wife who told my MIL that my wife was in the hospital. She got mad and called my wife repeatedly until she answered and MIL started yelling that my wife should have told her so she could come ""help"", and the call ended with my wife in tears and her blood pressure sky high. MIL called me yelling that she had a right to know and I had no right to keep her daughter from her family (again SHE- and her husband by default-is the only one being kept away from my wife at this time. Everyone else knew where we were). She told me I'm a bad husband, a bad father, and her daughter had never ""shunned"" her before ""I got my hooks into her"". She called me controlling and abusive. And I'll admit I lost my temper.

I told her that I couldn't stand her, and I don't want her- I made sure to specify HER specifically, not any one else in my wife's family- around my wife and kids anymore. She's done a lot of things to my wife that's affected her mental health. My wife is a nervous wreck any time she's around, to the point she's not even herself. She's nervous and she's jumpy and extremely irritable. She denied that any of it was her fault and blamed it on me, to which I pointed out it's ONLY HER that her daughter is like this around.

I blocked her number from my wife's phone (only while we were in the hospital) but she's been sending me relentless texts about how we ""can't keep keeping her daughter away from her"".

I did apologize to my wife for all of this. She says she's not upset with me.

So I (19F) live with my three other roommates (all 20F) in a college dormitory. We each have our own rooms to sleep in but share two bathrooms and a kitchen. Overall they are pretty great roommates. We communicate pretty well and share responsibilities, expect in one area, the kitchen.

88,1fyro7m,AITA for feeding my sister?,"My (35f) sister Kelly's (25f) boyfriend is in the hospital undergoing surgery and will not be able to work for a while. Kelly has been mentioning how stressed they are trying to prepare for this surgery/loss of income, and worries she won't be able to take care of him.

Last night she called to ask if I could walk their dog tomorrow since she has been cooped up in the house while Kelly works. She rarely asks for favors and I could tell she was upset. We talked a bit more and I asked if she needed anything I could bring with me when I came over, if she had eaten anything etc. She started crying and said she burnt her last few eggs that morning and couldn't afford anything other than ramen but she would be okay, work extra and figure it out.

My heart broke a little, I remember being so hungry living in my car in my late teens, then struggling with my husband in our 20s with young kids. I didn't have anyone to help me through my tough times and I don't want her to ever feel so alone. We are not rich but we're well enough off that we can afford what we need with some extras. I told Kelly I'd never let her starve and asked if she had any requests that I could make for her. Simple things that would be offered to anyone I love going through a tough time without a 2nd thought. She put up resistance but said she would take anything I was willing to give.

That night I ubered her dinner since I couldn't make it over. My husband Lucian seemed upset but said it was ""nothing"" when I asked if he was okay/why he was upset. I let it go as he tends to become more upset when pushed. I made extra dinner, extra muffins and decided that I'd spend $100 on staples/a toy for the dog since we had a bit of extra cash this month.

When Lucian came out of our bedroom from playing Xbox after the kids were in bed and saw me organizing the things I bought/writing instructions for easy recipes he was pissed and went off that ""she never helped you like this, why would you do all of this shit"". I told him that ""she was a child when I was younger, how would she have helped me? Even if that was true, that doesn't matter. Nobody deserves to go hungry, epecially not family and friends."" We went back and forth, eventually with him saying I ""wasted my time and money on someone who doesn't deserve all of this, what about us? What if I want banana bread? You put nuts in it, I don't like nuts"" and me telling him that he was ""being incredibly selfish, we have plenty to eat, I made a batch without nuts for him and there's more of everything for the family if he would just look. I'd understand if we were struggling but I'm not going to sit idly by while Kelly goes hungry because you don't like me spending time caring for someone other than you.""

He stomped off and has refused to come out of our bedroom all day besides to grab some snacks, ignoring the food I've made. I know he wants me to apologize but it just feels wrong.

So on Wednesday last week I went to the doctor for it and the doctor gave me these anti-histamine tablets and said my cough would be good if I took them.

I am still coughing, but I feel like it‚Äôs not as bad as it was an improving. But my mom is tired of this cough, and as a pharmacist, she‚Äôs been doing everything she can to help me. I‚Äôm slowly improving but my mom doesn‚Äôt think so.

Yesterday night my mom kind of told me I should go back again to the doctors, but even last week it was a big hassle trying to find a doctor that accepted walk in patients. Luckily I did find one, but I‚Äôm not sure I need to go again.

I told my mom this and she basically said I wasn‚Äôt taking responsibility for my health, and my sisters snakily said I was choosing to suffer because I didn‚Äôt want to go to the doctor again. 

My sisters said that my cough was annoying them and had become everyone‚Äôs problem and my sisters both told me to go to the walk in clinic I went to.

However, the clinic I went to didn‚Äôt start taking appointments until 12:30PM. I went at 1:00PM and I had to wait until 3:30PM. Luckily I could wait because I didn‚Äôt have any more classes, but tomorrow I do, and I don‚Äôt have much time in between. I feel like I am not going to be able to get an appointment I can wait for because of my classes.

My sisters said I should book an appointment, but as it is a walk in clinic I couldn‚Äôt. They started arguing with me and said I should try and tell them to hold a spot for me tomorrow but that‚Äôs not how walk in clinics work. They kept emphasizing and even close to yelling at me to book an appointment, but I told them how it was a walk in.

I couldn‚Äôt go today because I had a job interview, but I chose not to tell them that because I‚Äôm not really allowed to work during school but I wanted to anyway. So today my mom just thought I was being lazy. 

I‚Äôm going tomorrow to see if they can squeeze me in, but I feel like everyone is mad at me for not being adamant about my own health.

I feel like the doctor is going to tell me again to take anti-histamines but my mom wants to see if he can prescribe me something else. I don‚Äôt feel like going as I think the cough will go away.

Everyone is the house has been stressed over my cough, and even my dad said it‚Äôs hard to sleep because he hears me.

- Her parents are literally sending her rent money, and she keeps complaining to me about how she can't afford fun purchases and how having to pay money for rent is stupid (even though it's not even her money)

- She didn't renew her passport until a month before she needs it, and then got frustrated that wait times were over a month.

My girlfriend always complains about her weight and her body. I tell her I find her sexy for so many reasons outside her body and it didn‚Äôt matter to me whether she got bigger or smaller.

Eventually she decided she wanted to lose weight, I offered to help and when I pointed out things she could be doing better she gets mad at me. She isn‚Äôt losing weight currently and in fact says she is gaining a few extra pounds.

I ask her what exactly she eats in a day, she says she eats healthy so she should lose weight. I question that and we have an argument. I tell her that if she wants to show me, let me just spend a day with her and see what she eats in a day. She said only if I don‚Äôt make comments on what she‚Äôs eating as she‚Äôs eating it.

Now by the end of the day she had consumed, a plate of avocado toast that was about 400 calories, a coffee that was 110 calories, an 800 calorie salad from chick fil a and a fry (as a ‚Äúreward‚Äù for the salad) and veggie burrito that was about 500 calories. Along with snakinga but throughout the day. Her total consumption was about 2200 calories.

At the end of the day I explained this to her. My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she‚Äôll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn‚Äôt going to guarantee she‚Äôll lose weight.

She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn‚Äôt helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.

My exact words were that the amount of calories she is consuming is the amount I need to maintain my weight as a man 5 inches and 20 pounds bigger, who is constantly active. So chances are she‚Äôll slowly gain weight eating like that and that eating healthy isn‚Äôt going to guarantee she‚Äôll lose weight.

She got super fucking pissed at me and told me I wasn‚Äôt helping her and was just shaming her. I told her I want to help her but she did not listen.

I won‚Äôt give the exact reason, because it is very personal. My parents don‚Äôt want me to pay rent, so I don‚Äôt. 

My mom and I argue a lot because I don‚Äôt like her going in my room. It has been like this since I was in middle school. I told her multiple times to not go in my room because I hate it and she always messes things up, but because it is her house, she can do whatever she wants.

By ‚Äúmesses things up,‚Äù I mean she ruins my room. In the past, she has thrown away my school stuff, removed stuff she didn‚Äôt like, opens all my drawers and digs through every single thing, redecorates my room, throws out my plushies, throws away expensive stuff, and keeps all of her clothes in my closet (which is about 6-8ft in length) to the point I can‚Äôt even use it and keep all of my clothes in three small drawers and that plastic drawer on wheels you can buy at Target for $15 (that‚Äôs like 3ft tall, 1ft in width). Then, after doing all of this, she would say she was just cleaning. 

So, I very much hated her going in my room and wanted her to not even look in it. After I moved back in, she continued to do this even when I was an adult. The breaking point was when I left for a few hours to take care of some tasks, and I come back go find my room completely different.

If I‚Äôm in the house, she typically doesn‚Äôt try to get into my room, but if I‚Äôm out, she uses her key (there are two keys to my bedroom lock) and goes into my room. She says it‚Äôs to get her stuff (most of which I‚Äôve thrown in her bedroom out of anger), but I know it‚Äôs because she wants to snoop.

I‚Äôm completely sick of it. It‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt have peace and privacy at all. Knowing she can get into my room at anytime hurts my head and gives me anxiety. I want to change my locks, but I don‚Äôt know how she will react. I was considering completely throwing all her stuff in the closet out first and change the locks.

98,1fynsj5,WIBTA for accepting her money after surgery plans cancels my holiday.,"Let me preface this by saying I have a very busy and stressful job and I don't often go away on holidays.

So back in April/May of this year I decided I wanted to watch some international rugby as a treat for after a hard year. I planned to go to Dublin to watch the New Zealand All Blacks (New Zealand being the country I was born in) vs Irealnd (my ancestral country) then fly to London for a few days, i excitedly booked the flights and hotels (for Dublin and London) exchanged some currency and have been talking nonstop about how much I'm looking forward to it.

About a month ago, I got an email from the airline saying they've cancelled my flight, this was a bummer as they barely flew from my local airport and rearranging the flights and traveling to another airport proved tricky, so I decided to cancel the Dublin trip and focus on my getaway to London. I booked another hotel, train and again, told everyone how desperate I was for this little vacation. 

A few weeks ago, my mother started presenting with pains in her abdomen and back, she visited A&E who diagnosed her with gallstones. The plan was for her to eventually have surgery to remove the gallbladder, but a week ago, she was rushed into hospital with severe pain. A gallstone had become lodged in her pancreas, which she passed with fluids and an overnight stay. During the hospital stay, I jokingly said ""knowing my bad luck, they'll schedule your surgery during my holiday"" to which she replied ""it's no big deal if they do, it's only a simple keyhole surgery""

Well lo and behold, a letter arrived scheduling the surgery for... the very first day of my holiday. Mum suggested I cancel my holiday to take her to the hospital and be there for post surgery care. Naturally I was a little sad and disappointed to miss out on my holiday but I agreed. The problem being, all my train tickets and hotels are nonrefundable.

I've been dating my girlfriend (27f) for about a year now and during the course of the relationship, she shared with me her blog page which was like a journal of sorts. I was playfully suggested to have a look if I'm ever down for some reading. 

Sure enough, I obliged and never really paid heed to it. Here and there I'd read it but never obsessively. A while ago she told me about some stuff which bothers her regarding a former partner and she was quite sad about it and I hold tried to console her as best as I could and told her if she ever wanted to talk about it, I'd be there for her. 

A few days ago, I happen to open their blog and the same matter was blogged about a month ago. Seeing that it did bother her, I told her that I was sorry she had to go through that and of course if she feels like talking about it I'm there for her. She seemed very upset that I had read that and confirmed if I still had access to her blog. To be prefectly clear, at no point was I ever told that the blog is off limits. 

I told her that I'm utterly confused at the anger being directed my way when I was asked to visit this blog. I was told that I could read but not inquire about it and that her privacy feels violated and now she'll have to worry about me cross-examining everything. 
When I pointed out that I was asked to read it by her, she responded by saying that it did not imply that I would be asking her about it. 

What has me stumped is the fact that the post was about a matter we did talk about. There was no new information there in terms of events although it did explore her state of mind a bit more. And to reiterate, I was asked to read the blog by her way back and was never told not to read it.

my auntie (F29) and uncle (M40) lets call them James and Molly are recovered addicts, they lost their children due to said addictions. a week after their children were taken I (F11 at the time) was with my friends until they ditched me, i was very close to James and Molly at this point and i was near their house so i decided to go and see them.
I saw them as they were about to go to the shop and i tagged along, we laughed and joked until we got there. we got there and before anything they withdrew some money, ive grown up around addiction and i knew they had their kids taken because of it so i was already suspicious
we got into the shop they actually asked me to get a can drink so they could use the can after so James could smoke crack.
i said yeah because i was too scared to say no and after i went home and immediately told my mum, this caused a massive argument and for the family feud to start.
they've now got their kids back and my grandfather passed in 2021 on the 5th of september, we had him cremated and we all have our seperate sets of ashes, James and Molly along with my other auntie and uncle we'll call Steve and Jane went on holiday with my cousins (they're innocent in this, they didnt know) and on this holiday they all took their ashes and went to spread them without us (the people funnily enough closer to him than them) and without telling us, my mother had to get old through our older cousin because my mum had blocked them but she hadnt and they knew that it would get back to her and destroy her. the reason this is so bad is because Molly went around boasting about putting in fake social services reports against my mum because, and i quote, ""i dont see why i should lose my kids and she doesnt"". my mother is recovered (Mollys children were at risk of death from breathing in the fumes.) and not only that, my mother was the one caring for my granddad while he died from 3 different cancers, palarisys and liver failure. so please tell me, AITA?

my auntie (F29) and uncle (M40) lets call them James and Molly are recovered addicts, they lost their children due to said addictions. a week after their children were taken I (F11 at the time) was with my friends until they ditched me, i was very close to James and Molly at this point and i was near their house so i decided to go and see them.
I saw them as they were about to go to the shop and i tagged along, we laughed and joked until we got there. we got there and before anything they withdrew some money, ive grown up around addiction and i knew they had their kids taken because of it so i was already suspicious
we got into the shop they actually asked me to get a can drink so they could use the can after so James could smoke crack.
i said yeah because i was too scared to say no and after i went home and immediately told my mum, this caused a massive argument and for the family feud to start.
they've now got their kids back and my grandfather passed in 2021 on the 5th of september, we had him cremated and we all have our seperate sets of ashes, James and Molly along with my other auntie and uncle we'll call Steve and Jane went on holiday with my cousins (they're innocent in this, they didnt know) and on this holiday they all took their ashes and went to spread them without us (the people funnily enough closer to him than them) and without telling us, my mother had to get old through our older cousin because my mum had blocked them but she hadnt and they knew that it would get back to her and destroy her. the reason this is so bad is because Molly went around boasting about putting in fake social services reports against my mum because, and i quote, ""i dont see why i should lose my kids and she doesnt"". my mother is recovered (Mollys children were at risk of death from breathing in the fumes.) and not only that, my mother was the one caring for my granddad while he died from 3 different cancers, palarisys and liver failure. so please tell me, AITA?

102,1fyn46q,AITA/ for quitting after only 3 weeks that my friend helped me to get,"Edit: Not mad at my friend over the job. That's not on her. I'm hurt that she didn't care that I was doing bad mentally
Edit2: We don't talk often, not even every week. I had never gone to her whenever I was upset. That's why her points don't apply nor make sense
 
My friend's job was hiring but it would only work if I could get at least 25 hrs a week since I don't drive and a lyft total is $40. She told the manager, and the manager said, ""Yes, we can do that"". I plan for next month, expecting to get 50 hrs per paycheck. Which would be plenty. 1st week only 12hrs. I text my friend that this won't work and I'd have to talk to the manager. ""You just started, and you're already thinking about quitting."" I explained that I didn't want to quit, I'd have to quit. My friend said that I shouldn't expect to get those hrs and that I went in with the wrong expectations and the manager didn't lie. 

I talk with the manager, and she said she couldn't give me 25 and I settled for 20 until the holidays come and hrs will go up. She wanted me to fill out my availability on the calendar. 
I told my friend. She didn't apologize for blowing up on me just, ""It seems you and her have worked it out. So we good?"" I didn't want to end our friendship over work, so I got over it. The next week, 15 hrs. I was right. She lied. 1st paycheck and didn't even make the money back that I had spent on lyfts. Next week, 14 hrs. I'm over it. I called manager and told her to take me off the schedule til the holidays, but she didn't want to. Im a great worker. After all my shifts, I was complimented on how I'd organize and get things done in so little time.

For weeks, my mental health had been declining and now working there made it worse. I tried to distract myself. Work, games, art, but I nothing helps. I had a breakdown. For 4hrs, I was sobbing, feeling stressed, angry, lied to, hopeless. I was supposed to go in the next day but let the manager know that I quit. I told my friend, saying, ""I quit today at ""___. "" I had a bad breakdown last night, and I'm just over it. Thanks for advocating for me, but it's just not going to work."" 

""I don't have anything to say, but ok.""

 I got mad. I'd never do that to her. We were supposed to go to Busche Gardens together, but at that point, I didn't want to talk to her for a while. I said, ""girl... Your friend just told you they had a bad breakdown, and you say that? I don't think we should hang out for a while because wow. Go to Busche Gardens with someone else."" 

She sends me a long text about being an adult, and how she's going to keep it real and how my ""breakdowns"" are exhausting to deal with. What? I hadn't had a breakdown like that in 2 years. She rubbed in her successes in life and said she didn't want to be friends with me anymore and wished me the best in life.

 I'll admit it was lame of me to quit short notice, but I said my needs from the start, and had the manager been honest from the start, i wouldn't have bothered.

103,1fymzbg,AITA - Homeless nephew,"My nephew is currently homeless. This is the 3rd time in about the last 12 or so years. He has had lifelong substance abuse issues and at some point ends up fucking up somehow. I've helped in the past and gotten burned every time, as has his other family. I've let him stay twice at different times, and both found him passed out on the floor. The last time I Iet him stay, he brought heroin into my house and that was when he was told he was no longer welcome here. He went into a treatment program shortly after and got into a section 8 housing apartment. He's been on methadone for about 5 years now, but sometimes drinks and takes klonopin and blacks out and does stupid shit. Apparently he had some altercation with another tenant last month. He used some highly racist language, got a complaint filed against him, which he screwed up not responding to and as a result was evicted. Then shows up here while trying to get his mom (who has pretty much cut him out of her life at this point) let him stay with her. No was the answer and so I let him have one night on my couch.

Anyway, I let him store some things in my garage a week later, but he's now 3 times just showed up at my house under the guise of getting something from his stuff, and asking to use the shower, bitching about how unfair everything is and nothing is his fault... I have anxiety issues, and he knows this and that coming here without any warning is very stressful to me. I've been stressing out thinking any day is going to be him knocking at my door. Today was that day and he's now been here for 3 hours and I really just don't want to deal with him anymore.

104,1fymrou,AITA for telling my sister what guy I liked better?,"My sister hasn't been in a relationship yet, but she's been looking. She has one guy that is 25 years old that asked her on a date. The date went well, but she's worried he's too old for her because she's 20 and in college and he's graduated and they're in different life stages.

But she told me that she's crushing on a new guy who is at her work. She mentioned that said guy that her phone broke and he gave her his old phone for free. She said they've been talking a lot at work and she has a crush on him and she thinks he might like her but she's not sure. He's around her age, like 21.

She started showing me pictures of both guys, and this is where I got in trouble. She asked me who I liked best for her and I immediately said the 25 year old.

She asked why and I said that the 21 year old was cute, but seemed like a boy, cute but skinny. It should be pointed out that I'm 25, so that look doesn't do it for me. 

But I said he looked around 140 pounds and she's around the same weight and as a woman it's never hot if your man is skinnier than you. Or the same weight as you.

She actually got upset at me for saying that. I kinda said it without thinking but she immediately said that bringing up weight was not cool, and that's insulting to say.

I tried to play it off and say he'll age like fine wine though, especially since he goes to the gym every day, so he's not a bad pick. I kept saying they would still make a cute couple despite what I said, but yeah she was not happy and looked super upset and left.

It's just kinda like... She asked for my opinion and now she's upset my opinion wasn't what she wanted? It's how I feel when I see those relationships, but she's welcome to be with whoever she wants.
