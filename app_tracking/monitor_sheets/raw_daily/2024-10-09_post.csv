0,1g00ccj,AITA for telling my best friend she wasn’t in a one year long relationship. ,"My best friend (F), came to me (F) complaining that her bf does not want to get gifts for their anniversary. I asked what anniversary she was talking about and joked about it being a “one week anniversary”. She got defensive and mad, telling me it’s their one year anniversary. I got confused and told her that they have not been dating for a year, or at least that it doesn’t count. For context, in the past year, they broke up 8 times adding up to weeks if not months of being apart and single. When I say break up, I mean they broke up and not just breaks, because along with those break ups they had a few “breaks”. A few weeks ago they had their “final breakup”, and it seemed like they were going to stay single and agreed to not even consider getting back together for at least 6 months. However, a week and a half later, they got back together. It’s been now 3 weeks since their last break up, and I just don’t think their last 5-6 months count. At some point they were not in a relationship for a month, with her now bf hooking up with someone else. I’ve been as supportive as I can be, considering every break up she tells me how bad of a bf he is, and that she is glad she is now single. I’m getting tired of constantly supporting her, only for her to keep repeating her behavior. I love her to death and want the best for her, but I don’t know if she even wants that. So, AITA for telling her they have not been dating for a year? 

CLARIFICATIONS:
-We are in our twenties. 
-We’ve previously had multiple talks about how this relationship isn’t healthy, she agreed with me, but I guess only because it was after the breakup. 
-Idc about the date, ik it doesn’t count for me, the purpose was to point out in another way, how their relationship doesn’t even look healthy.

1,1g008qq,WIBTA For leaving my Dad's House,"For some context I should add I am 16(m) and that my biological parents split when I was 6. During this time my dad married someone and for awhile we were good, but a little while later when I was 10 we became more tolerable to each other for reasons I don't even understand. Around 13 me and my step-mom got into are biggest argument yet, and escalated to the point where I was sent to a family friends house for a couple of days. A year later I was sent to my Mom's house for 3 months because me and her go into another fight and could no longer stand each other.

Anyway when I came back it took some time heal our relationship, about half the year after I came back. It went good for about the next half of the year until yet again our relationship became tolerable and not good if you know what I mean. Now I would also like to point out the reason our relationship only goes down hill is usually because of her values of being a Christian and other things and demanding of respect to an older person(which I believe is from her culture),and while mine are more you have to earn my respect than just demand it(More from family background). There is more conflicting ideas but those are the main ones. Another reason is that she gets mad easily over minor things and I have the problem of my face showing anger which it doesn't really take much to show.  Anyway now to the story that finally tipped the scale was this recent Saturday when we just all finished breakfast and on our list it was my sister's turn to do the dishes, but I offered to do it for her and she said yes. Anyway when my Step-Mom heard this she got angry and started working her self up again on why I would do dishes for my sister, and while this happened I looked down and scowled, because I was getting frustrated that I am getting trouble for helping, anyway she caught this and completely blew up and started yelling. She then started to take clothes she bought recently and took them away from me(For note she did not taking all of it) and threatened she was going to send me back to my mom's, which in anger I replied back I wanted to go anyway.

Now this morning she apologized to me as I was getting ready to and live with my Mom next week and said that she said somethings she regrets, but went on that I have been arrogant for not paying attention to her and avoiding her. I also don't want to hurt my dad by leaving, but he also supports her with me avoiding her and be arrogant for not also saying sorry. I am still debating whether should I go or not(Not asking for Advice), but I think if I don't go another big right will happen and cause stress in the household for those who are not even involved, and my sister did refer to me that when I was gone the house was at its most peaceful state, so I'm not sure me leaving will also bring peace to our house.

3,1fzzyxx,AITA for leaving a party early because I felt bullied,"This happened a month ago and I am not much of a overthinking or thinker at all but I can't let go of this incident. 

I (33 M) went for dinner at a friend's house and there were 5 of us. My close friend (32 M) was there too. We started joking about something stupid I did and I thought it was funny but he suddenly started saying a lot of rude things after that out of no where. 

He said things like I was faking my laugh to pretend like I got the joke. He knows I am on the spectrum so he was joking about my lack of understanding about certain social situations. Other people on the table joked that he was behaving like a school bully which I agreed to as well. Then he points to me and calls me spineless for needing other people to help fight my battles. 

  
I have no idea why he started saying all this. We usually fool around but this was way beyond normal. I got pissed, got up and said I don't want to be here and left. I haven't spoken to him since and no one else at the party. The friend sent an apology message but no one else reached out either. 

  
I am now thinking that I was being overly sensitive and should not have left like that. I am okay with losing friends but Idk if I was the asshole.

They live in North Carolina in one of the small towns that were hit. I will not say which one for privacy. Luckily they were not home when it happened. Instead, they were off in Illinois for my wedding. They have been staying with me for around 3 weeks now.

Both my sister and myself have children. She has a 5f,3f, 1m. I have a 6 year old and a 2 year old who gets into everying. I have absolutely everything locked. Cabinets, door handles, appliances, outlit covers, you name it.. This is 100% needed with my toddler.

Since day 1 of my sister being here, she has been complaining about all of the locks. She thinks they are a pain and will constantly leave everything unlocked just so she doesn't have to deal with it. My toddler, and hers, have been getting into absolutely everything. It's dangerous for them, it's a mess and quite frankly, it sucks. 

I have tried talking to her about it but now, she's trying to play the guilt game because she lost everything and we said she could stay here. I get it, it sucks. It's absolutely devastating to have nothing to go home to. She hasn't even fully processed it yet, but this is still my home.

Yesterday, I reached my absolute limit with it when my toddler got into my cleaning closet. Luckily all he got ahold of was the broom. I admit, I yelled at my sister. She started yelling back about losing everything. I yelled it wasn't my fault it happened and told her she needed to find somewhere else to stay.

6,1fzz9jp,AITA for apparently “wasting” my friend’s weekends?,"I am 19F and have been best friends with a girl since childhood. We have been friends for over 10 years. She (18F) works full time Monday-Friday. I only get to see her on the weekends and usually always sleep over at her house on a Friday or Saturday night. When i get there we talk about what we have been up to and about general things. We also play games and show each other stuff we’ve seen. The next day after we wake up we will have breakfast and go on our phones as you usually do in the morning to check your messages or emails and have a little scroll on social media. On a morning she doesn’t talk much. She stays silent and just looks at me and then doesn’t say anything for at least an hour. I’ve now gotten used to this silence after 10 years. What am I supposed to do for that time? Just sit there and wait for her to talk to me? I’m gonna go on my phone and have some me time until she decides to talk to me. 

She is quite a controlling person so i’ve gotten used to her having her own way with things like these. Sometimes we end up on our phones for a while. I don’t see anything wrong with spending time together while also not actively doing anything or talking to each other. She has never had a problem with it before. She does it all the time. But now all of a sudden this time she claims i’m “wasting” her weekend. 

I understand she works all week and has the weekend to relax or do whatever she wants. But it’s not like she had other plans. She didn’t sacrifice spending time with someone else to spend time with me so why all of a sudden does she have a problem with us being on our phones when she never did before. There’s times where i’ll try to talk to her and we will for 5 minutes and she will go straight back on her phone. To me that doesn’t seem like i’m the problem. 

After that she said we should do something instead. I thought she was about to say we should go somewhere. She said “you should bring a colouring book so we can colour”. You made a big deal saying i’m wasting your time to suggest we colour instead. First of all is that not exactly the same thing as being on our phones. We will both be sat doing the same thing but separately while most likely not talking because we are concentrating on colouring. Secondly she has at least 5 different colouring books and so many colouring pens/pencils/crayons/sharpies. So if she really wanted to couldn’t we just use her books and pens. We have done it before. So clearly she doesn’t have a problem with me using her stuff. 

She brought up this whole problem and made me feel like a shit friend when she literally gave her own solution???!!!!! And she’s being a massive hypocrite. Should i just leave earlier when i wake up so she can do whatever she wants? Should i just not go on my phone the whole time i’m there cause she clearly has a problem with it even though she does the same?

As one of the more tech-savvy members, I’ve been put in charge of making graphics to post on social media to announce gigs, but the president of the group (46F) handles the actual posting on socials. I prefer it this way, but an issue has come up recently.

It was subtle at first, but slowly it's become more and more clear that she's been really heavily editing the photos. It was just her own photos at first (like, pics taken mid-show of her that she edits) but now she's taken up editing...well, everyone. 

There are a few main issues:

1. The photos she edits of herself (and now other people) are really obviously edited. Picture 2015 Snapchat ""beauty"" filters or that ""yassification"" meme from a few years ago. And beyond that, it's making jawlines slimmer, changing eye shape/size, etc. Even adding essentially ""digital hair extensions"" and more makeup. It's uncomfortable at best, and insulting at worst.

2. The filter is also an AI filter, and when the filter ""catches"" parts of the photo that have words/complex things in it, it gets warped. In one photo, someone was wearing a pin with words on it that got super weird in the way only AI can make it weird.

3. She isn't asking any of us if it's okay that she edits our photos. Again, this was whatever when she was just editing her own (even though it was really obvious and botched the overall picture quality), but now it's others in the group.

A few of us discussed it and brought it up gently. I mentioned how people, especially my fellow Gen-Zers online, can really easily clock AI editing, and it might reflect weirdly/poorly on us. Plus, the issue of not asking permission to edit others.

She got defensive, saying, ""Well, sometimes we need the editing."" That rubbed me the wrong way, so I replied (more kindly than I’m expressing here): ""It’s best practice to ask for consent before changing someone’s entire face structure on FaceApp. You can edit your own face, but others didn’t ask to be edited."" She countered, ""If I only edit my face, it’s really obvious unless I do it to everyone else."" I couldn’t argue that it’s obvious even in solo shots of her, so I dropped it.

I tried to wrap up by saying: ""We need to be careful about editing and get consent before posting heavily edited graphics--"" She cut me off with: ""Well, I don't want graphics even made where I have a double chin.""

(It’s also worth noting that she gets annoyed with other members who are self-critical about how they look in the photos she posts and tends to handpick shots where *she* looks the best, regardless of others.)

I know this likely stems from her own self-esteem issues, but she seems to be putting that pressure on the rest of us. Now she’s acting really upset with me, and we couldn’t discuss anything else regarding an upcoming show because she was too mad. I feel like an insensitive jerk for bringing it up, but it’s spiraled out of control. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA for telling my bandmate to stop over-editing photos she posts of us?

11,1fzy7y8,AITA for leaving my mom before a hurricane?,"I 30 live at one of my older brother’s house temporarily, until I find my footing. We live in Florida, our mother(69) also lives in the same home. Now there’s a hurricane, a catagory 5, coming to the state and our area will be impacted. For those of you that don’t know, a Cat.5 is incredibly dangerous/deadly. My older brother’s(49) work requires that he be present in the much more dangerous part of the state to provide relief. So it just leaves myself and my mother. As we were preparing I took a look at our town’s evacuation orders. We are situated in an area that’s likely to suffer from a storm surge, a large amount of displaced water that is projected to be about 15ft.

Now with this storm I did some research and looked at the projected outcomes. I explained to my mom that staying home is dangerous and we should evacuate to a nearby shelter. She says okay and I go about collecting my essentials and some bobbles to keep my mind occupied. When I was done I went to her room and asked if she needed help. She tells me that she wants to stay, citing that she has “diarrhea.” I tried to reason with her and convince her that this was not safe for about 5 minutes. She dismisses my points and says she wants to stay home and tells me to go. 

So this is where I may be the asshole, I left because in my mind landfall of the storm was eminent within a few hours and I didn’t have time to argue. I tried to convince her as I got ready to leave but she was adament that she was in “God’s hands.” 

Now my siblings, that live a few hours away weren’t pleased. I’m sure my mom convinced them that I left her to save my skin without a thought. My sister 46, and another brother (41) were berating me for leaving her. I ended up blocking them, after briefly explaining that I wasn’t successful in convincing her to leave. Now prior to them blowing up my phone, I was making periodic checks on my mom. The storm was a few hours out. On one of these checks I told her to let her pack of wolves know I’m not dealing with them anymore. While we were talking I asked if she wanted to come to the shelter with me as a last ditch attempt to convince her. She tells me that she had a friend that offered to pick her up and offer shelter, however they lived too far and this was the 11th hour of the advent of the storm. 

I was incredulous. She’d rather die than go to a shelter at a school for a few hours. I explained myself again that the situation was life or death and somehow managed to convince her to join me at the shelter. So i rushed out to get her, the storm was still several hours away and the winds were not too dangerous to drive in. I told her to get her stuff and we headed towards shelter. During the drive I berated her and asked what had changed from 3 hours ago, when I initially told her to come with me. She says that she was convinced that she was in an unsafe situation by my siblings and her friends. Now I am catching flack for leaving her when she was being undecided.

He came out as gay, and we mutually agreed to part ways. Changing my name wasn’t a priority—updating IDs, legal documents, and bank accounts would be a huge hassle. I still use his last name on official documents but go by my maiden name socially.

Recently, he got engaged to a wonderful guy. I’ve been supportive of their relationship, but during my grandson’s birthday party, my ex suddenly asked if I’d consider dropping his last name. His fiancé chimed in, saying it makes him uncomfortable that I still use it. I was caught off guard and awkwardly joked that unless they want to spend hours in lines at various government offices, I wasn’t going to change it. My ex didn’t laugh. He insisted it’s about starting a new chapter and wants me to “move on.”

The whole situation felt bizarre. For two years, it’s never been an issue, and now they’re ganging up on me? After the party, my ex called and argued that keeping his name makes it hard for his fiancé to feel like they’re starting a fresh life. I countered that our kids still use the same name, and it would feel strange for me to be the odd one out.

What really hurt was learning from my youngest son that his fiancé feels threatened by my name, assuming I’m clinging to some claim on my ex. I’ve made it clear I have zero interest in rekindling anything, but it feels like I’m being pressured to erase a part of my identity. My ex admitted his fiancé is uncomfortable because he sees me keeping the name as a “power play.”

I didn't know the other girls but I decided it'd be a great opportunity to make new friends too.

Now, for my age, I'm a little curvier/heavier than the ""average"" girl like me. And I learned through harsh words in the past by people at school and such so I've gotten used to it, but that doesn't mean it doesn't still hurt my feelings.

When the time came to practice our dances and such, I started to notice the girls would separate off from me, I payed it no mind, they didn't know me. But when it came to picking out the dresses we'd all wear, I didn't like the way it fit me, I talked to my friend about it, she apologized and got me a bigger size, but the other girls continued to ridicule me, calling me names behind my back.

15,1fzwxi6,AITA for letting my friend ask out my other friend? ,"My (25F) friend (25M), who I just recently reconnected with, invited me and my other friend (21F) to a theme park a little while ago. Let’s call my first friend John and other Sara, now John and Sara had never met previously and when John invited me he said I could bring a friend, and I chose Sara. I did show John pics of Sara just so he knew what she looked like, and he ended up saying that she was cute. I thought nothing of it and when we all met up to go the theme park, everyone was in good spirits and getting along really well. 

The day was going great and we were having a lot of fun and after some time, John pulls me aside and asks if it would be okay to ask for Sara’s number after the end of the hang out. I told him I think it would be okay, but I ended up not telling Sara that he was going to do this. I figured since they’re both adults, they could handle it and if it goes somewhere, great! If not, that’s okay too. 

So at the end of the day John walked Sara to her car, and asked for her number. Sara texted me a little while later saying “just so you know John asked for my number and I was kinda studded and I ended up giving it to him, and he mentioned something about you saying it was okay if he asked?” After that I fully admitted to Sara that I told him I think it would be okay and I apologized if that made her feel uncomfortable and said if that ever happens again I would give her a heads up first, if she prefers.

Sara said she wasn’t into him like that but could handle gently rejecting him and remain friends with him. So I left it at that, but for the next week she acted cold, but I ended up again apologizing and we (I thought) reconciled. Now, this was around the time of my birthday and John kept saying we should all do something for it. After Sara and I reconciled, John was still asking about us going out (this was also after Sara rejected him but was remaining friendly) and I asked Sara about it and if she wanted to go, and she said yes to my surprise. 

Before we all went out, Sara texted me saying that she was feeling weird about going out and that it might be awkward but was still willing to come. I told her that she absolutely didn’t have to come if she didn’t want to and that it was totally up to her. She said she would end up coming but her texts were very cold and short.
We ended up going out to dinner and all was good and everyone was friendly and having fun, no weird tension, at least none that I could feel. 

The dinner was about 5 days ago and now Sara is acting very cold towards me again and is even leaving me on read.

I thought nothing of it and when we all met up to go the theme park, everyone was in good spirits and getting along really well. 

The day was going great and we were having a lot of fun and after some time, John pulls me aside and asks if it would be okay to ask for Sara’s number after the end of the hang out. I told him I think it would be okay, but I ended up not telling Sara that he was going to do this. I figured since they’re both adults, they could handle it and if it goes somewhere, great! If not, that’s okay too. 

So at the end of the day John walked Sara to her car, and asked for her number. Sara texted me a little while later saying “just so you know John asked for my number and I was kinda studded and I ended up giving it to him, and he mentioned something about you saying it was okay if he asked?” After that I fully admitted to Sara that I told him I think it would be okay and I apologized if that made her feel uncomfortable and said if that ever happens again I would give her a heads up first, if she prefers.

Sara said she wasn’t into him like that but could handle gently rejecting him and remain friends with him. So I left it at that, but for the next week she acted cold, but I ended up again apologizing and we (I thought) reconciled. Now, this was around the time of my birthday and John kept saying we should all do something for it. After Sara and I reconciled, John was still asking about us going out (this was also after Sara rejected him but was remaining friendly) and I asked Sara about it and if she wanted to go, and she said yes to my surprise. 

Before we all went out, Sara texted me saying that she was feeling weird about going out and that it might be awkward but was still willing to come. I told her that she absolutely didn’t have to come if she didn’t want to and that it was totally up to her. She said she would end up coming but her texts were very cold and short.
We ended up going out to dinner and all was good and everyone was friendly and having fun, no weird tension, at least none that I could feel. 

The dinner was about 5 days ago and now Sara is acting very cold towards me again and is even leaving me on read. 

AITA for not giving her a heads up? I could see how I would be the asshole since that did seem to make her uncomfortable. I’m just very confused as to why she’s acting like this and I want to understand why she’s feeling the way she is. ",0.0,1.0388571,1,0

My cousin struggled to handle everything because of his work and thought about getting a maid to help with the kid and in the house. Since I'm not busy every morning, I offered to look after his daughter.

For weeks, I woke up early every day to make breakfast, clean the house, even wash the clothes of his daughter, and take care of her. I never complained even though I did it for free because I loved the kid and treated her as my own.

One day, I decided to go to the grocery to buy food. I asked the kid to stay in the house and already prepared a simple lunch. She was just alone in the house and I forgot to lock the gate.

Hours later, my cousin called me and told me not to come back to the house anymore because I was too stupid to leave his daughter alone in the house with no key in the gate. Although the kid is safe and nothing happens still he gets mad because of the safety of his daughter.

I didn’t say anything and hung him up. He was also upset because I didn't apologize for what happened and just left them.

I told him no and if he wants to buy the house he must speak to the realtor like everyone else. My aunt said she’s going to sue me for my dad cheating her out of a home and money. 

I talked to my realtor and she sent me to a property lawyer for consultation and the lawyer  said that’s not happening. So I’m goin on with my plan to sell the home.

18,1fzwddm,AITA for confiscating a student’s toy,"Hi everyone, throwaway account!

So, I (50F) am an elementary school teacher, and something happened last Friday.

I have a student, let's call her Emily (8F), who has been bringing a small stuffed dinosaur to class every day for the past couple of weeks. At first, I thought it was harmless and maybe even a bit cute. But then it started to become a major distraction. Emily would often place the dinosaur on her desk, talk to it during lessons, and even make it ""walk"" around her desk while I was teaching. The other students started to be more focused on the dinosaur than on what I was teaching, which I wasn’t happy about. 

Last Friday, when I was teaching, Emily started making the dinosaur ""talk"" to the student next to her. I had already asked her multiple times to put it away, but she would only do so for a few minutes before taking it out again. I tried confiscating it for a bit, and then when I gave it back, she still continued to disrupt class; I was frustrated and, in a moment of irritation, I took the dinosaur, walked over to the window, and tossed it off the our top floor outside into the schoolyard.

Emily was upset and started crying. I immediately questioned my actions, but the damage was done. I tried to go back to teaching like nothing happened, but she was so upset she was crying so much that she distracted my whole class.

Later that evening, I received an email from Emily's mother, accusing me of being cruel and unprofessional. She said that the dinosaur was a comfort item for Emily, who has been dealing with anxiety recently, and that I had traumatized her daughter by throwing it out the window. She demanded an apology and said she would be speaking to the principal about the incident. Sure enough, I just was called by my principal that we need to have a meeting on Monday. 

Now, idk what to do, and I’m pretty nervous for said meeting. On one hand, maybe I shouldn't have thrown the dinosaur out the window. But on the other hand, the dinosaur was genuinely disrupting the class, and I had already tried to address the issue several times.

20,1fzvzbj,AITA for ending friendships over a conversation?,"I (37F) have a group of friends that I have been extremely close to for 7 years. We get together at my friend's house (let's call her Jane, 48F) almost every Tuesday night to talk for an hour or so, then read a Bible study or watch a video & discuss. Over the last year, the study nights have become more of a hang, which is still supportive.

 

We do tons together, from hanging outside group, meals, trips, just generally being sisters. Our group is lovingly called ""Hot Mess"" because we all have ""colorful"" histories. Ex-biker chicks, drug-dealers, divorcées.... just alt people that Christians ostracize. The theme for this group is all about love and acceptance.

 

Since the pandemic, things have changed. These open-minded gals have slowly become MAGA supporters who will make borderline hate comments that are born out of innocent ignorance. I'm kinda left & we've learned that it's easier to avoid politics. I made it clear that I will leave when hateful comments come up.

 

Last night, while we were catching up before reading our study, we got on the topic of gender-affirming surgeries. One gal (let's call her Dorothy, 37F) has a trans-BIL (afab) who is getting top surgery. Dorothy is being supportive of him and is good about not deadnaming or misgendering. Jane (who is Dorothy's bestie) is not great when it comes to that community, and makes comments that can repeat, even after she is offered info that might educate.

 

Last night, Jane said she doesn't get why a trans person who isn’t hetero would need to transition. To clarify, she doesn't know why someone AFAB (who identifies as male) would want to be romantically involved with a Cis, gay man. 

 

I say that gender & sexuality are 2 different things. I don't claim to know everything LGBTQIA+, but as a cis, pan gal, I tried explaining. Jane said that anything other than ""cis straight"" or strictly ""cis gay"" relationships are just a kink. Dorothy agreed, and they said that's just because they're ""old-school"" & just ""don't get it"". I asked Jane if she's really saying that my identity is just a kink, and she said yes. 

 

I had my husband call w/an ""emergency"" and left. Jane asked me if they chased me off, and I said no. 

 

I discussed this w/my hub/ texted my mom & sis, and decided that I needed to end these connections but I don't want to ghost them.

 

I said:

I know that I hold different political beliefs that most of the group, and I can respect that (so long as we don't discuss it extensively) but when it comes down to insulting or erasing my own identity, that's hurtful. I tried to explain it so you might understand better, but I wasn't given that opportunity. 

 

I love this group so much, and the last 7 years of being family and supporting each other have meant the world to me. I sincerely will miss you all so much, but I have to protect my peace, as well as my mental health, and this isn't something I can handle anymore.

 

Dorothy: I'm not sure what you're even talking about- no one is asking you to erase your identity. We were just explaining where our heads are at with the whole thing. I think you are blowing this way out of proportion. 

 

Do what you gotta do. I'm freakin out about my parents being in Florida right now so I can't handle much more at this point.

Jake is generally a lovely lad, but he has this infuriating habit of purposely trying to wind me up. He’ll poke me when I’m trying to concentrate, make loud noises when I’m on a call with mates, or even nick my stuff and hide it just for a laugh.

I get that he doesn’t always understand boundaries, but he knows exactly what he’s doing when he’s being annoying.

I tried to ignore him, but after the tenth time, I lost it and shouted at him to “give it a rest already!”

Jake just stared at me like I was the villain and wandered off. My parents overheard and told me I needed to be more patient with him because “he doesn’t know better” and that I shouldn’t take it to heart. They said I should “set a better example” since I’m older.

I honestly felt well frustrated because it seems like Jake gets away with being a pain just because he’s autistic. I know I shouldn’t lose my temper, but it’s hard when I’m trying to do something important and he’s constantly interrupting me.

Some of my mates think I was justified in my reaction because everyone has their limits and I shouldn’t be expected to put up with his behaviour indefinitely. Others think I was an arsehole for losing my cool and that I should find better ways to cope and communicate with him.

22,1fzvcfx,AITA for taking my son to a pizza restaurant?,"
Hello. I am a single dad (35M) with two kids (12F and 8M). I have a pretty good relationship with my ex. It was my daughters birthday last Saturday, and when I asked her what she wanted to do for her birthday, she said she wanted to go to a pizza restaurant for dinner with a couple of her friends and then take them back to my house for a sleepover. This isn't exactly a very big extravagant party; so I said of course, and that was that. 

Now here's some context, my son is lactose intolerant, and eating or drinking anything containing dairy wrecks his stomach but it's not like a deadly allergy, just diarrhoea and occasionally vomiting. He can't eat pizza. Obviously, I couldn't leave him at home, so I told him he would have to come with us. 

Fast forward to the day, and everything is going fine. I ordered my son some fries and some other nice sides like dough balls and stuff that he could eat. He seemed happy. My daughter was happy. I thought it had gone perfectly.

Then a few days later, my ex texted me saying “I can't believe you took [sons name] to a pizza restaurant! You know how much he misses it!” I replied that I thought it was fine and he'd still got a nice meal, but she said he felt “excluded” and like he was an odd one out. She said I could have dropped him off at hers and she could have looked after him for the evening, or even hired a babysitter or something because apparently he found the whole thing “humiliating”. Also “there was a risk of cross contamination and he shouldn't be aloud to just go to random restaurants”

So now I feel bad and I realise maybe he did feel a little different, but I didn't realise it had upset him so much. So uh, AITA? I really feel the  dad guilt right now haha 🥲😅

So we live in a two-story apartment we’re on the bottom floor and they are above us and they  like to blast music to the point it’s some what vibrating  our bed sometimes, which I don’t have a problem with or I don’t like it, but I wasn’t gonna complain because we were all up at seven anyways and we go into the living room so it’s not that big of a deal.
 
But This morning they were blasting music like louder than they usually do it and it woke up me and my baby at 5am. And I love my sleep and she wakes up early enough anyways so I would like to get the sleep I normally get you know.

It’s a little funny because they were blasting birthday sex and I mean, I could hear the words, like I could sing along with it if I wanted to yk 🤣 

But I am going to talk to them and ask if they could just wait till 7am like they normally do. It’s just a little confusing because they know that we have a baby (she’s 15 months)and we’re new here (3 months)so I didn’t want to you know be that neighbor but they’ve been blasting music everyday almost since we moved in.

 I just thought it was like common courtesy and these are older people too like they aren’t younger like me and my boyfriend are like we don’t even do this. This is the first time that I would openly complain like obviously I have my opinion, but I never said anything to them yet.

I’m just not a confrontational person either so I don’t want them to get mad and just blast it even louder you know.

(when I called the front office I wasn’t even calling to complain. I was calling to see what the quiet hours were and it’s 10pm to either 6 or 7am the front lady said)

So we live in a two-story apartment we’re on the bottom floor and they are above us and they  like to blast music to the point it’s some what vibrating  our bed sometimes, which I don’t have a problem with or I don’t like it, but I wasn’t gonna complain because we were all up at seven anyways and we go into the living room so it’s not that big of a deal.
 
But This morning they were blasting music like louder than they usually do it and it woke up me and my baby at 5am. And I love my sleep and she wakes up early enough anyways so I would like to get the sleep I normally get you know.

24,1fzucq6,AITA for following my late sister’s wishes and kicking our brother out of her funeral,"Edit: I needed to bold a sentence 


My sister passed away recently after a long illness, and before she died, she made very clear instructions regarding her funeral. She specifically did not want our brother, John, to attend or receive any of her ashes.

To provide some context, growing up, my sister wasn’t kind to John. **John also was not great**, they fought like cats and dogs. As an adult, she sought therapy, recognized the damage she had done, and tried to make amends. She apologized multiple times and reached out, but John refused to reconcile. He was clear that he didn’t want a relationship with her.

When she became ill, my sister made one last attempt to reconnect, asking John to visit her. He declined again, stating that he had no interest in repairing the relationship, even as she was dying. This hurt her, and she made it clear that if he didn’t want to see her while she was alive, she didn’t want him at her funeral or receiving any part of her remains. In her view, if he couldn’t show up for her in life, he had no right to be there in death.

 John showed up at the funeral uninvited, I think our unlce gave him the date and time In line with my sister’s wishes, I asked him to leave. He became angry, caused a scene, and accused me of being cruel and preventing him from saying goodbye. 

Several family members have since criticized my decision, saying I should have let him stay for closure. Saying that funeral are for the living but I pointed out this was her last wish 

He thinks is am a huge jerk and I am a refusing to give him anything of hers still.

The family is mostly split.

I am female 17years old. Me and my friend decided to be partners for our big school dance. It’s not prom since I do not live in america. It’s the first big dance for me where people can actuallly dress up. At that time I did not know that my friend prefered for us to not look similiar. A while ago I bought myself a really pretty blue dress. I send a picture of it to my friend who is my partner. I was super excited for her response but she got mad at me and assumed i would buy a different color dress since her dress was also blue. The fact that our dresses looked similiar didn’t bother me but she was still mad at me. I didnt really think about it that much before bying the dress since I really liked the dress and it was the only one that really fit me. My mom also loved it. It has been some time since that happened and I though she was fine with it. Now she has send me messages stating all the acceccories that I should wear and things I souldnt wear since she already planned to wear them. She also said that I shouldnt have my hair up since she is going to have her hair up. I told her that this was also a big day for me and I wont dress according to her rules. Then I told her that I wont mind it if she finds another parnter. I didnt really mean it to come across as rude but she took it that way. I only assumed she would want to find a new partner since I wont dress like she wants me to. Now she has sent me a picture of her crying and a voice message where you can hear her crying and asking me why would I say something like that. I feel deeply saddend by this since I do like her a lot and have shared a lot of deep stuff with her but now I feel like she is starting to misunderstand me. I do not know what to do and I feel like my friend is giving me a lot of pressure and I always have to make sure that she doesnt hurt her feelings.

He met my brother Julian (20M) then and they  started seeing each other no too long afterwards. I didn't necessarily like the way Todd treated Julian sometimes and Julian had some weird Soccer accidents sometimes...but Janna convinced me to stay out of it and Julian hadn't told me anything major.

Julian had even started getting the bed again.. I knew something more had happened but Julian didn't want to talk about it. He's been in therapy and has been doing better. When Janna told me she wanted Todd at the wedding I told her no and I didn't want him around Julian.She tells me thats it's not fair..

Please forgive me for how I type as it's hard for me and I'm upset at the moment. I can't talk about it with family as I don't fully know how they feel about Trans/LGBTQ folks.

 I was speaking to a group of friends on discord yesterday, in this group was myself, two Trans friends(This will be important) Emilia(mtf, 27), Elias(ftm, 28) and our friend Charlotte(29). 

For context Emilia's family isn't supported of her being trans while Elias's family is.  We were talking about whatever, and as we were talking we could tell Emilia was upset. We were trying to make her feel better(She is only this upset when 1. A pet died. 2. A loved one died. 3. Her family is being shitty to her.) After a hour or so of talking she asked: 

""Guys? can I ask something...I guess silly? Dumb almost?"" We were all like ""Yeah, what's up?"" She then asked ""What if by some unknown force, you woke up and you were the opposite gender?"" She then when on to talk about something her Father had said to her, It was bad, and she wanted comfort. We all took turns talking about what we would do.

When it was my turn, I told her ""Bro, I would just be a Malewife! Marry a Girlboss and be a stay at home husband, I think it would be nice! It won't be too different than what I do now!"" I when on to make jokes about me being a Malewife. They laughed at that and began to make jokes about it to me when we heard ""Bitch, what the fuck is wrong with you?""

Charlotte's boyfriend had walked into her room when I made the Malewife joke and was listening. He when on to tell me I was a bitch, along with other awful names, and told me that the Malewife meme was transphobic and how he ""Fucking knew a disabled (r-slur), like you would be a bitch."" He begin to tell Charlotte how I was a (Native American slur I do not want to repeat). Charlotte then disconnected from the video/voice chat and logged off.

Both Emilia and Elias both began to tell me that he was just a ass and to ignore him and that they both know that I am a good friend and that they both know that I'm not transphobic or any kind of phobic. That I'm a beloved friend. I smiled and we continue to talk.

Today, i got a DM from Charlotte, telling me that maybe her boyfriend was right about me and how she was going to try and convince Emilia and Elias to not to speaking to me anymore. And not to speak to ""MY friends."" anymore. I am sad, heartbroken, and worried that maybe I did say something wrong.

This is where the problems began. I handled the following situations poorly. Their dog would rush the fence anytime it saw me or my wife outside, or even inside, and bark aggressively. A blue-nosed pit barking until it coughs. Our dog was a barker, but we always rushed outside to scoop him up and apologize for any issues. We lost him to lymphoma shortly after the new neighbors moved in.

Any time they let it out, it went to the fence and would bark like mad when it saw me, even if I was passing a window inside my own home.

He pulled out of his driveway and took off he appearing to ignore me intentionally. This frustrated me, I yelled an expletive, and decided to go pound on their door to at least try to talk to the wife about the issue with the dog. No one came to the door, which frustrated me more. I yelled ""TAKE CARE OF THE DOGS OR NEXT TIME IM CALLING THE COPS!"" After which I went back to my house.

He and my stepmom were not super cool with it but when dad asked me if I wanted to see my grandparents without my stepsiblings and I said yes, he agreed to the time. He told me if I ever wanted to change my mind I should speak up.

I have three half siblings (6, 5 and 2) now and they also come along for BBQs but not for the grandparent time.

My stepmom's mom was the only grandparent my step and half siblings had. But she's the biggest asshole and last year she and my stepmom stopped talking after her mom called the other kids names.

Since that happened my dad and stepmom have felt worse about my step and half siblings wanting to be included more in my mom's side of the family. They really grew attached to my grandparents. But my mom's side don't really consider them grandkids or family. They get included because they're part of my stepfamily. My dad tried to talk my grandparents into having grandkid days with all of us but my grandparents said no.

Last month my dad begged me to ask my grandparents to invite us all to grandparent time. He said my step and half siblings have no grandparents anymore and I have two. He said I have two really loving grandparents and they deserve it too. I told him I want to keep that time with them. They're my connection to mom and I like being with that side without the rest of the stepfamily. He said at my age it's not like I get as excited as I was. I said it makes me feel better inside when I get time with just them. That it makes me feel so loved and eases some of the sadness that I don't remember my mom. He told me to ask anyway and we'd figure it out. But I didn't ask. I don't think it would be what my dad or stepmom thinks because if my grandparents don't love them it won't be the same as what I get out of it. And I don't want to lose the time I get with them on my own.

My dad and stepmom are mad I didn't ask. They said I should do what they ask me as my parents. And I should think of my step and half siblings.

32,1fzsec4,AITA for being myself,"EDIT 

Last 2 weeks - i have tried to meet her multiple times, she said she is super busy, I called her many times but she never called back, we only text like once or twice a day, its nothing like before, WHAT HAPPENED? What’s going on??
—————————————————————

SORRY FOR THE LONG POST, It’s necessary context, PLEASE HELP ME 

It’s been 5 days since this happened and i have been on a roller coaster of emotions.

I(M24) will keep this short and concise.

She (f25) had been my friend since the first day of college, its been almost 18 months since, we have been very GOOD friends since that day (if not best-friends). 

I have liked her for almost an year now but planned to never tell her because i was not a 100% sure that she is into me, she gave me many reasons to think of both possibilities during this time.

She 2 months ago confessed and i was over the moon and believed ill will finally be happy now. She told me that i have bot been very expressive to her and this will have to change going forward. I agreed but also told her that I’m hardwired this way and I cant change overnight but i will make efforts and i did ( i cant even express how hard it has been for me to do it but I did make changes).

She fell I’ll for 10 days and I didn’t wanted to bother her with all this relationship stuff so I kept it more friendly and helpful during this time. But used to visit her every alternate day and send voice notes, texts explaining that im working on being more open with you and all that stuff to which she would say she will ALWAYS help me, tell me when i was wrong and I should not over think. 

Once she got better i planned our first official DATE. 

One day before the date i was at her place, we talked about 1. she is not materialistic at all and doesn’t expect any grand plans for the date 2. This is our dating phase and we should get to know each other better before committing 3. Our fears, Her past relationship trauma 4. All this while cuddling and kissing constantly for three hours.

On the day, she got me flowers (unexpected and felt very special), we went for a dinner where i got a bit nervous and she said relax its not as if we are meeting for the first time, we talked about ourselves 
( made a conscious effort to not talk about anything else). Later we went to an art gallery where I slightly ruined her mood by joking about her spending too much time looking at stuff and not talking much. After that we went for a walk and then sat a romantic place where we talked more and made a list of all the things we will do together as an effort to bond more. It included all sorts of stuff from learning new skills to opera to sports. I asked her if she would like to come over for a movie which she denied coz she had a headache. We got on a train later and started talking as if we are strangers and discussing about our day, i told the STRANGER all that happened this night and how i really like this girl but I think the date wasn’t up to the mark and i was nervous if I would get a second one to when she said you will definitely get another date. Once we got off the train we were waiting for a cab and she pulled me and we kissed. We sat in the cab, didn’t talk much but I asked again if she would like to come over if had no work to do at home. She denied again.

Next 5 days we didn’t talk much, meet once and I could tell she was not happy and something was off. 

She came over after work the next day and said she 
- the date wasn’t good because i got very nervous and hesitant at time, I sought of made her feel bad at the art gallery with my joke, 
- she had to kiss me instead of me making the move, ( this I believe was my biggest fuckup ever, i was going to kiss her that night but wanted to make it special and at the right moment, and when she did it i was not even thinking about it and was taken by surprise)
- we should not do this and just stay friends, we can always get can together later if it feels right. ( she had a similar guy in her past and doesn’t want this to happen again)

I tried explaining, apologising, reasoning, reassurance her for 2 hours, i broke down like thrice will doing all this, she said just can’t get this thought out of her head, she likes me too but doesn’t want to take to next stage. After this we cuddled, kissed a lot for 2 hours (why would she even do that if she didn’t want to continue). Even after that I asked her, pleaded her to not end this, I don’t want to end this, she said she doesn’t feel good doing this either (she continued saying she likes me alot) but this is the best for both of us. 

Its been 5 days since, we have hardly texted or talked on phone, i have asked her to meet me twice to which she said she wants to but can’t as she is very busy with work and stuff. (I know she can meet).

I’m shattered, heartbroken, feels as if my dream to be happy has ended. I can’t stop thinking about this even for 2 minutes. Since the last few days all i was  just trying to find ways to help her with her past issues and helping her be more comfortable and getting over her fears. 

What should i do now? 

I have thought of trying to convince her one last time, showing her how i had explained all of this to her to will she ALWAYS said she will help me figure out and tell me whenever I’m doing something wrong. Most importantly, she should not let her past stop her from giving this a shot, it genuinely hurts when she compares this relationship with her past, me with the other guy.

PLEASE ADVISE ME HOW SHOULD I DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION 🙏🙏🙏. I have invested a lot, made a lot of efforts. I can’t just simply move on and think of getting with some other girl.

My friends say I should just be friends and not continue this, which to me feels like giving up and i will forever have that regret of not trying to convince her one last time. 

Dm me if you want any extra info.

The father (m36) is not actually their father (who I’ll refer to as dad anyways) but was basically their stepdad since birth. In between children, they split up and she had gotten pregnant and tried to find other partners and it never worked out. She went back to “dad” and stayed for a while until he became a closet alcoholic/drug addict. It became very taxing in their relationship and they would constantly fight in front of the kids. She decided one day that it be best to leave the situation. He still begs her to come back even after a year. Out of the kindness of his mom’s heart, my friend now lives with his mom while she’s getting back on her own two feet. She has a bartending job and drives for our local taxi business. Trying to make money. She has a good bit of money saved up even thought she barely makes anything. “Dads” mom is now making my friend feel guilty for not being further in life and doing more to support her kids when she’s trying her absolute best to be a good mom and be involved while also working on getting o her own two feet. “Dad” doesn’t help much now that they aren’t together. But wants to reap the benefits of being called “dad”. So I started to help my friend with her kids so she can work. My friend has since found a guy at her workplace who she has recently started a relationship with and he’s not the best but I’ve told her that she needs to focus and do for her and the kids right now but she also needs to feel like a human being for mental sake.

Our kids are friends so I gladly watch hers when needed. But as of late, “Dad” is saying that my house is an unhealthy environment because the youngest (2 yo) has been saying curse words. I have a very big potty mouth but I don’t swear directly at the children. However, their mom does swear consistently in front of them as well. I stood up for myself to “dad” and expressed how that shouldn’t make my house an unhealthy environment and that I can always change my behavior and that I didn’t think that made me a bad person to help watch the kids that he so chooses not to support but claims to be their dad.

35,1fzrwgm,AITA here? I for feel guilt that my [30M] wife [28F] admitted to me that she is miserable over the fact that I’m now sober?,"
I decided to get sober (from alcohol) around the beginning of 2024. I had been a steady drinker throughout my 20s and since COVID, it had ramped up significantly and I was becoming more and more comfortable with several tall boys after work every night. After some health scares, I figured it would be best to just see how far I could go without drinking, and then I didn’t really miss it as much as I thought I would so I decided to stop completely. (Note: I still use cannabis products). I’m very proud of myself in a way that I’ve never been. I never dreamed I would be someone who is sober. 

Additionally, even more recently, I started to take my diet a lot more seriously and started intermittent fasting, which I can feel already is really helping with weight loss and eliminating the overall shitty bloated feeling. 

My wife still drinks. I have no issue with this whatsoever. I’m really not tempted by alcohol in any way shape or form so I couldn’t care less. However she did say that she would start fasting with me, which I was enthused by. I figured it would help us hold each other responsible. 

Today, my wife was upset due to a number of things including work stress, several unexpected home expenses, etc. As we’re sitting on the couch, during some  conversation, my wife mentions about how stressed she is about everything recently and how she can’t drink or eat (during fasting) which were her favorite things to do to relax. I told her she absolutely can do those things even if I’m not, I really don’t care. She tells me that she knows I’m proud of myself and that you have to be judging her for not being sober and not fasting. She says she’ll continue to fast with me because she “knows I’d be disappointed in her if I stop”. I even explained that my sobriety and weight loss goals are my own, it’s really a “me” thing. It’s not really about her in this particular instance. She is very upset with her current weight as well and says she will not be happy even if she’s thin. I think this is a narrative she’s telling herself. 

TL;DR I feel like I’m indirectly causing my wife to be miserable because of my recent life decisions about sobriety and weight loss. I’m feeling insanely guilty and like a huge asshole but insanely proud of myself at the same time and I’m really confused. I hate to see her unhappy. 

EDIT: yes I used the term “sober” but several of you have pointed out that it’s not entirely accurate if I still use cannabis. Wasn’t my intention to deceive anyone (or myself!) so let’s just say I “quit drinking” instead. Lol. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA here?

We already had 4 different neighbours. No issues before. 

I hop i to quick shower between 7-7,30 am (like 5 minutes max, rinse, showergel, rinse again, Done). 

My son is in quite a lot of pain and he gets analgetics at 6 am, he and other patients also have BP, temperature and I guess saturation(?) checked around that time. Ať 7 am is official end of calmer night shift, so I hop in for quick shower, while my son watches TV or tablet. Usually analgetics kick in by then.

I cannot really take shower later because it is quite busy - nurses, rounds, he has several medication with different schedule and it is usually quite Hard to plan when exactly I could do it. Also in the morning my son is  significantly calmer before the day officially start. 

Today I got stern talking to by our neighbours, I apologised to disturb them but pointed out it was in accoradance with the rules of the hospital. Mother was still quite annoyed and was then making lot of noise on the other side of the wall. They got discharged today and were side eyeing me every time we met

Am I really the asshole? 

It is the most convenient time for me, my son is in a lot of pain in the evening, so I really dont feel comfortable with showering the plus he is willing to leave the bed and go wander. During the day it is quite busy, we are teaching hospital and my son is very nice example of the disease, so we have a lot of traffic.

None of the other parents had a issue, we were talking friendly to eaxh other, exchange little gifts for kids, help out with etc. 

Now I do not want to dish the other party, but they were quite loud, mom was leaving quite often for cigarette and her daugther was crying quite a lot 😥, mom was watching loud  TV Long into the night (last night ať least 2 am) but I understand it is Hard to be in a hospital with sick Kid, we each have a different schedule and I would never complain about that. 

She claimed I was waking her up, but they had check up ať 6 am, ať 6, 30 we are getting tea for the kids and usually break fast fot the kids before 7 am, so she already had 3 people in her room in last hour. 

TLDR - Taking shower at shared bathroom at 7 am, neighbour from other room went quite ballistic for waking her up even though she already had at least 3 people in her room last hour.

38,1fzrm0s,AITA Asked SO’s to buy me a new moisturiser? ,"So… some of you are going to think this is boogie as hell and maybe you’re right. 

Basically my SO’s friend arrived at our place for a gaming/hang session. My partner was running late, and their friend asked if they could use our shower because the one at the gym was closed. No prob. I gave them a towel and said they can use whatever toiletries they like. My first mistake.

So I head out to see my friend and leave them to it. 

I come home and they’re playing Xbox and having a great time. I head into the bathroom to take off my makeup and do my skincare routine… and I see a huge man sized scoop taken out of my 6oz pot of Egyptian Magic.

A little background. I have super sensitive skin that will break into psoriasis for literally no reason. So I spend a lot of money on good quality product. Egyptian magic is expensive but I can rely on it 100%. 

I was pissed because it was UNOPENED before today. I hadn’t used it yet. 

I go in to ask who used it, and his buddy so nonchalant like says oh yeah I used it on my body after. 

I was literally raging. You don’t use this stuff on your body! We had cocoa butter right next to it for that! 

I told him he shouldn’t have and he needs to replace it. 

He counters that I said he could use what he liked. 

And then my SO gets upset with me for being rude and told me to forget about it. 

So… 

AITA?

41,1fzqwdr,AITA for holding a grudge towards my boyfriend for going on *my* laptop in a restaurant to do work?,"Me (22F) and my boyfriend (21M) went out to dinner last night to a cute little (cheap!) Vietnamese place not far from my house. He texted me suggesting we go out for dinner a couple of hours beforehand, while I'd been at work and he'd been studying, as we both really like that place and hadn't been out in a while.

I took the bus from work to go and meet him at the restaurant, and whilst I was on the bus he calls me and asks if he can borrow my laptop to upload a report for an AGM he had the following day (tonight), as his phone wasn't allowing him to do it and the only other device he had was his iPad (which he'd been studying with earlier). I said sure, thinking that he would do it quickly after dinner when we were back at my place (which is where we were going to be staying for the night).

But no, we get to the restaurant and he asks for my laptop. Silently and disapprovingly, I gave it to him, and he sat at the table for a good 20 minutes or so uploading this report while I sat in silence across from him. We've had some other issues recently (unusual for us) so I didn't want to cause a scene, but I couldn't believe his behaviour.

In the restaurant, I did the ordering - which I do struggle with a bit because of social anxiety, but anyway - and he didn't get off the computer until the moment the food arrived.

I expressed to him how rude I thought he was being, but he insisted that the upload had to be done right there and then. (For reference, the AGM was for a hobby club that he is on the committee for). He said he didn't want to cancel dinner plans after he'd suggested them, even though he knew this report business was going to take a bit of a while. Either way, I felt really disappointed.

When we got back to my place at about 8:30pm, he ended up calling some of the other committee people on Zoom and he was in the call for at least two hours. When he was done, all we could do was go to bed as we both had classes early the next morning (today). Zero quality time.

Also, he was shaking pretty much the whole time he was in the restaurant as well, which is pretty unusual for him. It's now 11:55pm on the night of his AGM, which started at 7:30pm, and he's still not texted or called back (ie: he's probably still in the meeting). I'm not planning on seeing him again for a few days.

So, AITA for thinking it's really rude of him to go on my computer in the restaurant, or was his need-to-upload a valid excuse for this kind of behaviour?

42,1fzqvsn,AITA for asking my friend to change her Halloween costume? ,"I (21f) have been friends with a girl I'll call Ellie (21f) since we were like 12. We're very close, but we are also very different. She loves going out, being with her friends, going to clubs and getting drunk, and I love being with my family, having chill nights with my friends, or going to brunch. That being said, there is absolutely no judgment, she's in college, it's absolutely normal to want to have fun. 

We were discussing our plans for Halloween and she told me she'd love to do something together. I was planning on going trick or treating with my younger sister (9f), and she said she had planned on going clubbing with friends. We both really wanted to spend Halloween together, so we decided on a compromise: she would come trick or treating with my sister and I, then we'd go clubbing together. 

This was a while ago, maybe two or three weeks. We also talked about what costumes to wear, and she told me she already had an idea of what she wanted to wear. I just told her ""nothing inappropriate"", jokingly, with the winking emoji. 

Yesterday, she FaceTimed me to show me the outfit she had chosen. I'll try to describe it as well as possible: it's a dark red latex miniskirt, a dark red latex top that's kind of like a bra, and then the top and bottom are sort of tied together, like there's a few strips. And then she has sort of garters on her legs. I'm really not describing this well, but the best way I can explain it is, it looks like what you would see in a porn video, or a strip club. I'm not judging that, just trying to help picture it, it looks kind of like sexy underwear. 

She looked awesome, but I told her that her outfit wasn't really appropriate to trick or treat with children. I told her that it was amazing for the club, but maybe not to be around children and parents. She told me that there was nothing inappropriate, she was dressed as a devil like many people/kids. I said that I felt like it wasn't very appropriate and asked if she could wear a different outfit to go trick or treating and then change at my house before going to the club. 

She got very mad at me and said that I was basically calling a slut, and that I was just jealous because I couldn't pull off this outfit and wasn't as pretty as her, and I didn't want her to get more attention than me. I barely replied, because I really don't know what to say. I'm saying this again, I have no problem with the outfit itself, and this is not me trying to control what she can or can't wear. I'm just saying, we're going to be surrounded by children so it feels inappropriate. I don't necessarily feel like my request was unreasonable but I can understand why it feels controlling to her.

I know James believes his mother cheated  but I have talked to his other sibling and they don’t think so. Really it was a messy situation where they were on constant breaks and mom pulled the plug. 

Anyways James bio dad hit the bottles and he passed away before James graduated college. His mom and Ryan married and he hates Ryan. He blames Ryan for the divorce and how his bio dad handled it. 

I have personally met Ryan and he is decent guy. James has confirmed with me that Ryan has only be polite to him, he doesn’t have any complaints against the guy besides blaming him for the divorce. He also doesn't cause drama at events, just acts like a normal guest

ORIGINAL WITH EDITS: I do not allow smokers to hold my infant baby. No hate on smokers, I just don’t want my infant baby exposed to it intentionally. My MIL knows how I detest vaping and cigarettes as it casually came up during one of our conversations when I was pregnant. Fast forward to after giving birth, I recently found out through multiple reliable sources that my MIL has picked up smoking cigarettes and thus has been hiding it from me so she can hold my baby. To my knowledge she wasn’t a smoker. To boot, she lied to me about why her apartment smelled like someone just lit up a cigarette in her living room and blamed it on the neighbors. 

I am going to ask my husband to set the following boundary (because I am too angry to do it politely) if she wants to come into our home and hold our baby: take a shower in our home, wash your hair, use the clean clothes we bought for you, and wear a mask (I would take her shopping to buy her clothes that she likes). These are a few tips I picked up from researching what would limit the third hand smoke impregnated in my MILs skin, clothes, hair, and breath. I can foresee the conversation not going well because my husband is protective of his mother, and he is also aware about how I feel as it relates to third hand smoke. Even within my own immediate family whom smoke have never asked me to hold my baby. They appreciate my baby from a far and I respect them for it. I know I can’t force my MIL to do any of the above and that’s okay; it just means she won’t hold our baby or come into our home. 

As infuriated as I am that my MIL thought it was a great idea to hide this from me and lie about it, I love my MIL. I would gladly meet her at a restaurant or somewhere public so she can see her gran baby if she finds my request unreasonable; she just can’t hold the baby.

To my knowledge she wasn’t a smoker. To boot, she lied to me about why her apartment smelled like someone just lit up a cigarette in her living room and blamed it on the neighbors. 

I am going to ask my husband to set the following boundary (because I am too angry to do it politely) if she wants to come into our home and hold our baby: take a shower in our home, wash your hair, use the clean clothes we bought for you, and wear a mask (I would take her shopping to buy her clothes that she likes). These are a few tips I picked up from researching what would limit the third hand smoke impregnated in my MILs skin, clothes, hair, and breath. I can foresee the conversation not going well because my husband is protective of his mother, and he is also aware about how I feel as it relates to third hand smoke. Even within my own immediate family whom smoke have never asked me to hold my baby. They appreciate my baby from a far and I respect them for it. I know I can’t force my MIL to do any of the above and that’s okay; it just means she won’t hold our baby or come into our home. 

As infuriated as I am that my MIL thought it was a great idea to hide this from me and lie about it, I love my MIL. I would gladly meet her at a restaurant or somewhere public so she can see her gran baby if she finds my request unreasonable; she just can’t hold the baby. ",3.0,1.0638851,1,0
45,1fzpx6v,AITA for asking my mom to leave my house?,"Me(18 fem) And my mother(45 fem) have never been able to live together, She was always on drugs during my childhood and i had to parent her for most of my life. Around 3 years ago she moved out of state to take care of her new boyfriend and his 3 kids. And i had to stay with my mentally abusive father. Once i turned 18(i’m about a month until 19 now) I moved in with my now Fiancé(18 male) and his parents. We were on the verge of being homeless and my mom finally cared enough to help us find a place in the city she lives in which is where we are now. We were doing just fine for ourselves once we made the move out here until she got into a fight with her boyfriend and expected an open door which we gave. Since then it’s only been 1 week, maybe 2. She has now taken over mine and my fiancés bedroom, bed and routine. Leaving me to sleep on a very small twin bed and my fiancé on a broken couch every night. I have always had back issues and now that i work in a deli i spend half my shift everyday hunched over a sink cleaning dishes so once i’m home i tend to not do any dishes, My fiancé will normally do them for me or i’ll do them on my days off if not. But now that she’s here she’s been doing them every night and today she said the house was trashed. The house isn’t clean but it’s nothing near trashed either. She then proceeded to call it embarrassing when more than half of the mess is her boxes she refuses to do anything with. Within these two weeks she has also talked crap about her now supposedly ex boyfriend while also calling him every day, still calling him cute nicknames and being lovey dovey but swears up and down they are never getting back together. They have been together for 5 years now almost 6 and they have broken up and gotten back together at least 5 times a month.

46,1fzphhn,WIBTA for not making a handmade gift for my friend when I made one for our other friend?,"Sorry about the vague title!

I’ve been friends with M (F22) for almost 4 years and our friendship has been kind of rocky. We met in first year of uni and lived together for 2 years after that. In the years I’ve known her it’s become very apparent that she is a harsh and sometimes rude and selfish person, she can often ignore things I say, tell me she isn’t interested in things I talk about, but demand attention for things she wants to talk about. She isn’t a bad friend persay, but she is a difficult person to be friends with sometimes. Around a year ago she properly introduced me to her friend E (F23) who I had only met briefly a few times before. We have a group chat together and all get along decently well. 

M has been more withdrawn and selfish than usual recently. She has been ignoring nearly every message me or E send in the group chat unless it pertains to one of her interests, but she will get angry if we don’t reply when she talks about her “not-quite-boyfriend” who she has been seeing on and off for a year and a half for example. Due to this, me and E have become really close recently and message each other independently more than in the group because we don’t see the point in talking with someone who clearly isn’t interested. She has ignored messages about important things like job interviews, life updates etc. She claims this is because she can’t reply to things at work, but she works a regular full time job in a clothing store and even on days off she will ignore us so it seems like an excuse for just not caring tbh. I understand work can be stressful and you don’t have time to message during the day, but opening messages, ignoring them and never getting back to them feels pretty rude when it happens on a very consistent basis.

E and M both have birthdays this month and I am crocheting a garment for E. I haven’t told M I’m doing this as she never seems interested in my crochet projects however we’re going away to Prague for a weekend trip for M’s birthday at the end of this month and I have no gift for her. I thought about making her a similar crochet garment but worry she won’t be interested in it and it will hurt me. It seems like an obvious decision to not make her something but I feel bad if she sees the effort I’ve gone into making E something handmade and she gets something random and store bought, as she would likely get upset. 

As I said, she’s not necessarily a bad friend and a lot of the time she’s okay but her actions recently have hurt me and E and so WIBTA for not making her something handmade?

49,1fzopnu,AITA for Canceling a Road Trip and Concerts After a Devastating Conversation with My Girlfriend?,"Hi everyone,

Long post, **TL;DR** on bottom.

I \[M26\] need some advice after a difficult conversation with my girlfriend \[F49\] that left me feeling humiliated. We’ve been together for about three months and had a very strong connection, both emotionally and physically. But after our first time having sex, things quickly went downhill, just two days before our first planned road trip together.

On the day we were intimate, it seemed like we both had an incredible time. We spent the entire day together, going on an amazing hike, enjoying great food, and cuddling for hours in bed. There were no signs that she wasn't enjoying herself. But three days later, during a follow-up conversation, she expressed disappointment. She made a hurtful face and noise that left me feeling completely emasculated. At one point, she said it felt more like fucking than lovemaking, which was a real blow. She seemed upset about her lack of orgasm, and claimed the whole experience felt rushed, even though we had spent the entire day together. Her tone was dissatisfied and increasingly critical, and a lot of her other grievances felt unfair. I felt like less of a man.

What hurt me the most was when she said she had dissociated during sex. This was incredibly alarming to me. She also made a disgusted face, like I was ""spoiled milk,"" and even gagged when talking about her feelings, which hit me really hard. When I commented on the face she made, she claimed she had never made it. I was left feeling like some kind of predator. To be judged so harshly after our first time felt deeply inappropriate, especially when I had thought we shared something special. I put a lot of time and effort into making her feel loved and cared for that day. I felt attacked, like I had been put on trial as a selfish lover, all based on just one experience. Knowing my body was the catalyst to her dissociation spooked me heavily, and made me feel deeply disgusted with myself.

This conversation unfortunately happened two days before our road trip, and the day before a major math test I had been studying for. I played it cool during our talk, but later, as I tried to study, I realized how much her words had hurt me. I was up all night thinking about it, and by the time we talked again, I had only 20 minutes to process everything before she called. I told her she had said and done some really messed-up things, and to not expect to hear from me for a while.

Not even 20 seconds after expressing how hurt I was, she said, “Wow,” and asked if I wanted to stop seeing her. I was completely blindsided, and it felt like a punch to the gut. Already struggling with my emotions, her question piled even more stress onto an already tense situation. It felt like she was carelessly throwing our entire relationship into question right when I was at my most vulnerable. I told her I didn’t know, and that I needed time to reevaluate, but inside, I was shattered. This was one of the most disheartening interactions I’ve ever had, leaving me heartbroken, insecure about our relationship, and whether I’d ever be enough for her moving forward.

In the end, I canceled our road trip, and a concert we were supposed to attend together. I needed space to process everything, and I didn’t want to risk having a fight on the road, which would have been a disaster. I was also supposed to meet her family during this trip, which obviously didn’t happen either. I went to the concert alone. After 10 days of no contact, I reached out to her to ask if she’d like to schedule a time to talk. She agreed, but her responses have been cold, formal, and distant, almost like scheduling a business meeting. I’m worried that my need for space has pushed her away further. I was hoping we would be able to reconcile this week, but our meeting won't be happening for another 6 days.

Now, I’m left wondering if I overreacted by canceling our plans. Should I have gone on the road trip despite my feelings, risking a confrontation during it? Can trust and intimacy be rebuilt after a conversation like this? And how should I approach discussing my feelings with her when we meet? Most importantly, AITA?

**TL;DR:** My girlfriend \[F49\] made me \[M26\] feel like a failure after our first sexual encounter. She said she dissociated during sex, which spooked me badly. She made a gagging face when talking about it. I canceled a road trip, concert, and plans to meet her family because I needed time to deal with it. Now I’m questioning if I should have handled things differently. Not sure how to fix this or if it can be fixed. AITA?

Fast forward to September 2nd I quit smoking weed completely and wanted to change my life around. I started talking to a army recruiter about enlisting in active duty and she seemed very supportive and proud of me Saying she wanted to be with me no matter where we went (moving wise) as well as expressing how scared she was.  I proceeded I studied hard for the Asvab (good enough to do almost any job) 3 weeks ago we go on our anniversary together for the weekend

52,1fzn2pp,AITA for making my stepmother cry in front of her family?,"My (16m) mom died when I was 5. When I was 8 my dad remarried. He started dating my stepmother a year before and he talked to me and my sister (24f) about it before. He told us we didn't need to see our stepmother as a new mom or even a mom figure if we weren't comfortable. But if we could be respectful and give her a chance to be something. He told us if there was anything off he wanted to hear that too. We gave our blessing while also saying we didn't want her to be 'new mom' and dad said he supported that and would make it clear to her. They got married and things seemed okay. Dad never called her our mom or anything and she... didn't really. There were times she called us her kids and she'd try to do some of the mom things like Mother's Day activities or sometimes we'd have stuff a parent-kid sports day and she'd want to go instead of dad since ""most kids have their mom"". But dad would gently remind her that she wasn't mom.

My sister and stepmother had a really rocky and rough relationship and they don't speak much. My sister tolerated her for dad after the wedding more than anything. But at first she was okay with her. She just hated that she didn't accept the no-mom role.

We spent after school with our grandparents until dad got home (he'd finish work before my stepmother). So she wasn't doing all the mom stuff. She did offer to quit her job to do it or to go to part time or something but dad and her talked and he asked if she'd be okay doing all that and not getting recognized equally. So she kept her job but still tried to fill the mom role sometimes.

My dad and her started trying for kids and they ended up going to fertility doctors and stuff. Even when that was happening she still tried to fill that role for me. But I still don't want her to be mom. The problem now is, she can't have bio kids. Nothing can help. Dad has been comforting her about it. But now she has decided that I could let her adopt me and we could work on changing our relationship. I said no when asked and told dad. He decided they needed couples therapy.

We were at her family's house Sunday afternoon and they were talking to her about the infertility stuff and she had mentioned she still has one kid aka me, and that we were maybe making that official and even if we didn't, she was still mom to someone. It annoyed me and my dad wasn't in the room at the time. And I said no. Her family all looked at me and I said she isn't my mom and we'll never make it official because it's not true. She started crying hard and my dad heard and came in and he brought us home. They got into a big fight that night and my dad told me I did nothing wrong but she said I humiliated her in front of her family.

53,1fzn1r0,AITA for secretly remaking my sisters eggs?,"I (23F) and my sister (35F) were invited to a family tea party with my aunts and cousins. My sister was asked to make deviled eggs, which she was really excited about. However, she has this weird way of making them she uses sour cream instead of mayo, skips the mustard, and the only seasoning she adds is McCormick imitation bacon bits. Honestly, they’re bland, don’t look cute and to top it off, she left them sitting out on the counter for way too long for my liking before putting them in the fridge. I was kind of grossed out.

While my sister went out, I decided to remake the eggs. I made them the traditional way—with mayo, mustard, real chopped bacon bits, and a little garnish on top. I even made sure to immediately put them in the fridge so they wouldn’t spoil.

Fast forward to the tea party, and when it was time to set up the food, my aunts were raving about how good the deviled eggs looked. My sister smiled and thanked them, but then she paused and stared at them confused. She realized they weren’t hers. Right in front of everyone, she turned to me and asked, “Did you replace my eggs?” I panicked and lied, saying I accidentally dropped hers on the floor and quickly remade them. She accepted my excuse but looked really irritated. I could feel the tension the rest of the party.

On the car ride home, she exploded on me. She was furious, asking why I would mess with her eggs and accused me of thinking I know better than her. I was trying to stay calm and give my reasoning but she kept yelling over me. I got really annoyed and snapped back saying that her deviled eggs aren’t good, that they’re always bland and look like goop, and that nobody ever likes them. I even said that people usually throw her other food away when she’s not looking because they don’t want to hurt her feelings.

She went silent for a second, and then she really started screaming. She told me I was a “fucking bitch”, and that I was humiliating her in front of the family. She accused me of micro managing and always trying to undermine her. She even said I ruined the tea party for her and made her look stupid in front of everyone.

Now she’s not speaking to me or I her, and I’m wondering if I went too far. I thought I was helping, but maybe I should’ve just let her serve her eggs the way she wanted.

We have been friends for three years, but over time, our views on life started to change. They grew up in a rich and complicated family, and have many habits that I find annoying or strange. They like to splurge on expensive makeup and bags, but we are still in school and I think we are too young for these things. 

There are been many issues other the past year, but one of them really affected our friendship. 

We both agreed to go to a concert together, and my friend asked me to buy the tickets. I asked my mum for help since I was busy that day and my mum was able to buy us floor seats. 

But my friend said they were too far from the stage and then went to buy her own ticket that was closer to the stage and also had the VIP soundcheck experience. I had to find another friend to go with since I had the spare ticket. 

Because I now had to go with someone else, I told her that we wouldn't meet up beforehand, but she expected me to go to her house and let her do my makeup before going. 

I still said no, and told her that there was no point in us going together if we were going at different times and areas. 

Ever since, she has started to ignore me, and I heard that she no longer wants to be friends with me anymore. I sit alone in classes now and worry about the situation. I worry that she will tell my other friends bad things about me and make them leave me too.

57,1fzmbtw,AITA for taking issue with how a flat trip is being planned? ,"Hey guys. Sorry, this is a long one. 
For a short while now, my two flatmates (22f and 20m) and I (24f) have been wanting to go on a road trip together to a landmark that is about 2 hours away from where we live. It has been up in the air regarding what we’re going to do and how long we’re going to stay when we get there. There’s also been uncertainty about when we want to actually go on said road trip. Until tonight.

My flatmate James (who also happens to be my cousin) and I were driving home from the gym when he brought up the trip. He said that he would like to go on a weekend that is approx three weeks away due to it being a holiday weekend in New Zealand, where we live. This I was happy with because we are all free that weekend. However, he then continued talking about it and told me that he and my other flatmate Allie had already decided that they would like to stay the night when we get there: not in a hotel/airbnb, not in a tent, but in their cars (separately). For those of you who are wondering, the landmark is in the middle of nowhere, which means there are no places in which we could stay. There’s also a no-camping rule at said landmark. James and Allie want to sleep in their cars on the side of the road. 

James continued and said that because they are wanting to stay the night, they will be taking separate cars. Therefore, I will need to take my own car on the trip too. Travelling with either of them in their cars is out of the question because neither of them want anyone else to sleep in their car with them (and understandably so). 

This plan did not sit well with me for several reasons. I’m a student, so I’m constantly financially stressed. I don’t want to have to pay for a full tank of gas if I can avoid it. My car is also very short. I’ve slept in it once before and that night I had one of the worst sleeps of my life because I couldn’t stretch out my legs and only slept in the fetal position. Also, the plan for the trip is being presented in such a binary way. The way they planned it - without talking about it with me at the same time - is that either the trip is done their way or I don’t come at all. 

I feel as if what I want to happen on this flat trip hasn’t been considered at all even though I’m just as much a part of this flat as they are. I also feel frustrated with the fact that they didn’t communicate with me until a plan was in place. However, I understand that compromise is necessary, that it’s okay that people have different personalities to me, and that people want different things.

58,1fzmboj,AITA for telling my sister who can't have kids that she does not get to be a part of naming mine and my wife's babies?,"My older sister (34F) was born without the reproductive organs required to have a biological child. Because of her condition she also has some other health problems which disqualify her from adopting due to the uncertainty around her quality and length of life. She was aware for most of her life that she couldn't have biological children. That was discovered when she was still very young but the rest came throughout her 20s. She had dreams of motherhood and had lists of baby names she wanted to use. But she will never be able to use them on children that are hers. What I (28M) did not know at the time was she had saved her baby names and was hoping she would get to name or help name my future children.

My wife (27F) and I are expecting our first child. We haven't announced the sex but my sister thinks we're having a girl and shared her girl names with us. We thanked her and said we (wife and I) would discuss what the name would be at some point. My sister looked upset by the response and she then shared her boy names thinking she got it wrong. We gave her the same response.

My mom suggested a couple of months ago that it would be generous and kind to let my sister have some input. I told her we felt it was better if we named our child ourselves.

My wife and I did look at the list, just to see if we liked any of the names. We did not. Names on the lists included Elizabeth, Hannah, Rosemary and Francesca for girls and James, Edward, Patrick and Michael for boys. Those just aren't to our preference. None of them were and there were more names.

My sister mentioned the names again recently and she said we should pick Elizabeth for a girl and Michael for a boy. She said that's what she'd do if she were having the baby. I told her we hadn't made our mind up yet but were still in discussions about it. She offered to help and I said no thanks, my wife and I want to figure it out between us. My sister said she wants to be a part of naming all our babies. That she would love to share all her endless thoughts on names that she'll never get to put into her own kid. I told her I understood she wanted that but my wife and I as parents would name our child and she does not get to be a part of that. I told her I understood that was hurtful to her but she does not get a say. I also asked her to please stop bringing it up. My sister told me I could let her have at least a little say in this and I said sorry but no.

She cried to mom, who thinks we should be more sensitive, while my dad told my sister I wasn't wrong and she needs to accept that she doesn't get to name our baby. My response has caused a divide among my parents and sister and me. It has been made clear my mom thinks I lack compassion and my sister believes I'm hurtful to her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA for telling my sister who can't have kids that she does not get to be a part of naming mine and my wife's babies? My older sister (34F) was born without the reproductive organs required to have a biological child. Because of her condition she also has some other health problems which disqualify her from adopting due to the uncertainty around her quality and length of life. She was aware for most of her life that she couldn't have biological children. That was discovered when she was still very young but the rest came throughout her 20s. She had dreams of motherhood and had lists of baby names she wanted to use. But she will never be able to use them on children that are hers. What I (28M) did not know at the time was she had saved her baby names and was hoping she would get to name or help name my future children.

My wife (27F) and I are expecting our first child. We haven't announced the sex but my sister thinks we're having a girl and shared her girl names with us. We thanked her and said we (wife and I) would discuss what the name would be at some point. My sister looked upset by the response and she then shared her boy names thinking she got it wrong. We gave her the same response.

My mom suggested a couple of months ago that it would be generous and kind to let my sister have some input. I told her we felt it was better if we named our child ourselves.

My wife and I did look at the list, just to see if we liked any of the names. We did not. Names on the lists included Elizabeth, Hannah, Rosemary and Francesca for girls and James, Edward, Patrick and Michael for boys. Those just aren't to our preference.

59,1fzmb6w,AITA for not really wanting to spend time with my best friend and their bf?,"Basically, I love spending time with my best friend when it’s the two of us or we are in a group (without their bf). We are super close and they act totally normal and as they did before they met their boyfriend. We make all our inside jokes, keep a conversation going easily, etc.

However, when they are with their bf, they leave very little room for me and other people. i dont think other people notice as much because our friend group is less close to them than i am. They try to include me, but them and bf are always whispering to each other, doing a lot of pda, and just generally it’s kind of a lot and makes me uncomfortable. pda does not normally make me uncomfortable, but this is on a whole other level. It kind of infuriates me and I think it’s because my friend never ever has acted this way. 

One of the reasons they act like this is because they have a hard time saying no to things. I think it would be different if they wanted to be doing this pda all the time, but from the conversations i have had with them, and from seeing them with their bf, the bf basically initiates all the pda and needs constant reassurance. bf is insecure it seems, and overcompensates. for example, my friend’s calculator died, so i offered them mine, and as soon as the bf heard that he jumped up and got them his instead. it’s little things like this that make me so annoyed because it feels like a competition. i get even more annoyed at the fact that my friend can’t stand up for themselves when they know it’s too much.

when we are all together, i do not enjoy hanging out. and, of course, people in general prioritize their significant other, so a lot of the time i don’t get to see my best friend. i feel really bad because i try to hang out with them, and i would just bite the bullet in order to get more time hanging out with my best friend, but when it’s the three of us it literally feels like im hanging out with a different person. I sometimes find myself acting kind of bitchy toward them while hanging out all three of us, which i feel really bad for but i can’t help it in the moment. We have talked about how we don’t really hang out as much, but I just don’t feel like anything is changing and i miss them. I would love honest feedback. AITA for being upset by this??

Reasons I may be the asshole:
- i could be blowing this way out of proportion and this may just be how it is with couples and i need to give my friend more grace
- could keep my emotions in control more",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA for not really wanting to spend time with my best friend and their bf?

61,1fzlzal,WIBTA for getting fed up with my sister expecting everyone to avoid coming out of their rooms every time she wants to be alone?,"
(TL;DR: my sister wants me and my parents to accomdate her need for alone time by staying in our rooms until she's done using a room. Has been giving attitude and throwing outbursts everytime someone inconvenieces her in the slightest. is adamant on checking on us to make sure we're asleep so she can be alone to the point where she will get onto you and message you repeatedly if your still awake, feel her approach is unrealistic)

So as the title says, my sister(16f) is particularly picky about wanting space when using the kitchen or when she wants to be alone. I think it's valid to want space once in a while, especially cause her room is located by the busiest part of the house and theres always someone there. 

I know how it is to need your space as someone who frequently needs space myself aswell,so I try to respect her wishes and give her that space s much as I can.

 She has been having outbursts of anger toward all of us lately, and while I do know that it's because she is struggling mentally and I feel bad that she is going through that, However I feel like it ends up being a problem when these moments become an almost daily routine.

Her moments of attitude and acting rude have been occuring almost daily lately, and its getting to the point where she will rant to me or my parents about what we did to annoy her repeatedly until the behavior is no longer an issue for her.It's usually small things most of the time too.

This has led to tension between me and her lately because I'll be awake and either go to use the bathroom or just walk around my room because I need to grab something or get ready for bed. Regardless of what I'm doing, if she catches me being awake late at night, it's more than guaranteed that im gonna be receiving a long rant in text coming from her bout how she's tired of this happening and how she feels like I don't respect her boundaries. 

Its frustrating whenever she assumes that I don't wanna respect her boundaries. That's all I've been trying to do and even tho she has a right to have a reaction to things,  I feel like my efforts are for nothing because shell find another reason to be annoyed with me. I have snapped at her a couple times recently cause I'm frustrated with her behavior, so I didn't handle myself the best 😅 so I might've been the ahole there but I wanna know what others think.

63,1fzlwym,WIBTA for not moving in with my boyfriend and his brother?,"My (31F) boyfriend (35M) wants me to move in with him and his brother (41M).

My boyfriend and I have been going out for 3 years now. Earlier this year he asked me if I wanted to move in with him and his brother and I said no. I’d like to move in together as I think that’s where our relationship is naturally progressing to, but I’m also fine to continue living separate right now.

Over the past few months we’ve talked about living together and it always ends up with the same argument about why I don’t want to live with him and his brother. I can understand his situation, he currently lives with his brother and is hesitant to move out because his brother does not have a high-paying salary and might struggle to rent a place on his own. My boyfriend doesn’t want to leave his brother in a difficult situation. And I also understand that this is will be more convenient financially since it’s easier to be in a 2 bedroom place for a reasonable rent and divide it in 3.

But for me, I have reasons why I don’t want to. One of the big reasons for me is cleanliness. I have a compromised immune system so cleanliness of germs and bacteria is important to me. I also don’t want to because I don’t feel like it would be our home, I feel like I’ll just be the extra person there who needs to make small talk and be in my room when they’re watching sports.

Lately, I’ve been feeling like I want to move. My living situation is okay, but my commute to work is quite awful and I’m looking for somewhere closer. I had started looking at places for myself but my boyfriend says I shouldn’t do that because then we won’t be living together for a year or two. But he isn’t willing to move in, just the two of us in the near future anyways. He says I should move with him and his brother to be considerate of his brothers financial situation for a couple of years and then we can find our own place.

She has been dating Adam 29M for about 6 years and he is really nice. The whole family loves him. He proposed to her last year and they were planning to marry in March next year. But here is the problem, Adam really wants children. He always plays around with our little cousins at family events and talks about what he wants to do and teach his future children. We always thought that they were just going to be adopting so we never brought it up. But since the engagement I have noticed that he always talks about them as their children, as in biological.

I told him some of the details and said that it would probably be best if he talked with Emma for the full story. He was quite for the rest of the evening.

66,1fzkidm,WIBTA for making a HIPPA violation on my sister-in-law ,"So, I’m in a tough situation and I’m not sure if I would be an asshole for taking action.

My sister-in-law (SIL) is a therapist, and to be honest, she’s been an absolute nightmare to deal with. She’s mean, vindictive, selfish, and a massive hypocrite. I resent her a lot for how she treats people, and to be perfectly honest, I have started to hate her.

But here’s the problem: she talks in extreme detail about her clients’ private matters in front of me. I’m not talking vague situations; I’ve actually been able to identify two of her clients based on the details she’s shared. She’s broken confidentiality in ways that seem blatantly wrong and unethical.

I’m in therapy myself, and I can’t even imagine what it would feel like if my therapist were revealing private details about me to someone else. I put so much trust in the idea that everything I share stays between me and my therapist. So, on one hand, I feel like it’s my responsibility to report this because what she’s doing is so morally wrong.

But on the other hand, I have to admit that part of me just wants her to face the consequences for her actions because of how much I dislike her. I don’t know if that makes me petty or vindictive, but I can’t tell if my desire for her to get in trouble is clouding my judgment.

But on the other hand, I have to admit that part of me just wants her to face the consequences for her actions because of how much I dislike her. I don’t know if that makes me petty or vindictive, but I can’t tell if my desire for her to get in trouble is clouding my judgment.

So, would I be the asshole if I reported her for a HIPAA violation? Is it wrong to report her, even if part of my motivation is that I resent her?",0.0,0.0754479,0,1
67,1fzkf1h,AITA for telling my sister she talks and acts unhealthily about food in front of my 8 year old niece?,"For some context, my sister (36F) has always been really concerned with her weight and appearance. As a teenager, she was extremely underweight and obsessed with being thin. She would restrict her food intake a lot and was constantly counting calories. She's healthier now and has even been to therapy in the past, but this obsession has never fully gone away. 

She frequently talks about ""good"" and ""bad foods, and I recently noticed her doing so in front of her daughter (8F). Whenever we're together, my sister says things like ""I can’t eat that, it’s too many calories"" or ""I was so bad today, I had a cookie."" She even praises my niece when she skips sweets or chooses a healthier option. I’ve even noticed my niece starting to pick up on this, and it’s worrying me. She’s started saying things like ""I don’t want to get fat"" or ""I've been really good today, I only ate vegetables.""

I'm really concerned that this is teaching my niece to have an unhealthy relationship with food and her body, just like my sister. I’ve tried to dispel this by encouraging my niece to enjoy all kinds of food and reminding her that eating is about balance, not being ""good"" or ""bad."" But I feel like I’m fighting an uphill battle when my sister constantly reinforces these negative ideas.

I gently brought it up and told my sister that I think the way she talks about food around her daughter could be harmful. I suggested that she might want to rethink how she approaches these conversations to set a better example. I really just want to help her and my niece build a healthier relationship with food, especially given my sister’s history.

Well, my sister did NOT take it well. She got super defensive and said I was overreacting, and that she’s just trying to teach her daughter good habits. She also told me it’s her child, not mine, and I should mind my own business. Now she’s upset with me and thinks I’m being judgmental.

69,1fzk80q,"AITA for Going Out with My Sister’s Close Friend, Knowing She Wouldn’t Like It?","I (22F) have been fighting with my sister (20F) for over a week now, and we haven't spoken since. We've shared a room our entire lives, which I think intensifies a lot of things at this age. We’ve always had two main issues: friends and clothes.

When it comes to friends, we have very different perspectives. My sister is more protective and territorial about her small group of friends, while I tend to mix all my groups—family, friends, everyone. I’ve always been more open and inclusive, even with her. In fact, she’s currently dating a close friend from my friend group, and I never had an issue with it.

Things went wrong when I went on a work trip to Cancun. I didn’t have a place to stay, but one of her close friends invited me to stay at his apartment. I’d always suspected he had a crush on me, which he later confirmed during the trip. We ended up kissing, and he asked me out. I hesitated because I knew how my sister would react, and honestly, I wasn’t sure if I liked him that much. But It was a great kiss, he has many qualities I like and I've been single for more than a year now and starting to get back into the idea of dating someone, I thought, ""Why not go on a date and see what happens?""

Here’s the thing—my sister never allowed us to get close. I suspect she always knew he liked me, and she’d get jealous whenever he tried to make plans involving me so she wouldn't invite me. I absolutely knew this could be an issue for her, but I decided to go out with him anyway. The date wasn’t great; I wasn't sure if I liked him. However, HE went ahead and told my sister that we were ""dating"" ???—after just one dinner. This, of course, caused a huge drama.

My sister was furious. She called me names, like ""slut"" and ""manipulative,"" and told me not to mess with her friends because she didn’t want to hear about him later crying over me. I felt incredibly offended and decided to stop talking to her for days.

The issue escalated when I really stupidly took one of her jackets yesterday. Clothing is another big point of conflict between us. She woke me up at 6 a.m. yelling insults and calling me names for using her jacket without permission, and believe me - that woman CAN yell, even my parents woke up. We had a extended family gathering later, and while I was out for a work meeting, she told everyone how horrible and abusive I was for taking her jacket.

I’m honestly exhausted. I think the way she speaks to me and treats me is the real abuse. I believe these are issues that could be discussed, but I have no interest in talking to her because of the way she treats me and the things she says.

By the time I’d gotten a job my mom had already put around $5,000 away in that account for me. I saved up another $5,000-ish but I decided I wanted to buy a motorbike as my first vehicle and voiced this very firmly to my mom. 

I got a car learner’s and restricted license so I can drive on my own and I’m confident driving. I got a learner’s motorbike license too and I’ve been taking lessons so I can actually ride a bike by the time I buy one (using my own money to pay for these lessons). 

So the actual problem: My mom recently went behind my back and took out all the money from the account and bought a car with it.

We met in May 2023 and I moved to DC from Boston to be with him in September 2023. After being together for around six months, he started pressuring me to get married and start having kids.

This gave me a lot of anxiety. He loves me so much and tells me all the time how much he wants to marry me. However, I don't think I feel the same. When I first met him, he presented himself as someone who is super motivated and has lots of hobbies but I have found that most of his spare time is spent watching tv or gaming. I do almost all of the cooking and cleaning. We also adopted a dog together and I mostly take care of her.

There are also things that I don't agree with him on. He doesn't think men and women can be friends so he doesn't want me to have any guy friends. He considers himself ""traditional"" and does not want me to keep my last name. However, I love my last name and I don't want to change it. He has also told me that he would be ""disappointed"" if we had a gay child.

In June 2024, he got stationed in CA and I moved out here with him. After being here for a week, he got put on a ship for four months and doesn't come back until November. During this time, I've been thinking about our relationship. He was again pressuring me during our phone calls to get married by My 2025 and said he wants me to start having kids by the time I'm 29.

He asked me if I could ever see myself marrying him and I said no. I've been telling him I want to go home and that I'm probably going to leave before he gets back. He started going back on everything he's told me and saying we don't have to get married for awhile or have kids and that he'll start helping with the cooking, cleaning and taking care of the dog.

But mostly I've just been telling him how I don't want to be with him so that we could both move on.

75,1fzjpa3,AITA for jokingly saying my fwb is untrustworthy?,"Me (22f) and him (44m) have had a fwb relationship for a little under a year. So far he's been very respectful and kind and generally easy to get along with. Recently, I was gonna go see fwb for a second time that week and my sister got annoyed bc she wanted to hang out that night. While I was asking if we could reschedule, I ended up joking about how my sister said she didn't trust him bc he's older and dmed her to wish her a happy bday once.

This got him pretty mad, and he immediately started calling us dumb and toxic. So I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to accuse him of anything, that my sibling is ofc gonna be protective about seeing a guy twice my age, and that a man in his 40s sending a woman in her mid 20s a random message can be perceived very negatively. For more context, my sister knows about him but doesn't actually know anything about the nature of our relationship, so it was naturally a shock for him to dm her.

Eventually, I did apologize for what I said bc I could tell he was upset about it and I shouldn't have joked about that when he hasn't given me reason to not trust him.

He was working at the time of this conversation, but ended up not replying after I apologized. When I asked if he was okay the next day, he asked if we could put it behind us.

I'd like to be okay with that, but my issue is that he didn't listen to anything I was trying to explain about the messy dynamics that can potentially exist in age gaps and why women are gonna be cautious with men they don't know, and instead he was just very angry and pretty rude.

AITA for joking about it/bringing it up when I didn't really need to? Or did he overreact? I want to validate people's feelings but I'm still not sure who was in the wrong.

(p.s. i think our age gap is important for context but don't really need comments on the relationship, just need an objective opinion on the situation)

So far he's been very respectful and kind and generally easy to get along with. Recently, I was gonna go see fwb for a second time that week and my sister got annoyed bc she wanted to hang out that night. While I was asking if we could reschedule, I ended up joking about how my sister said she didn't trust him bc he's older and dmed her to wish her a happy bday once.

This got him pretty mad, and he immediately started calling us dumb and toxic. So I tried to explain that I wasn't trying to accuse him of anything, that my sibling is ofc gonna be protective about seeing a guy twice my age, and that a man in his 40s sending a woman in her mid 20s a random message can be perceived very negatively. For more context, my sister knows about him but doesn't actually know anything about the nature of our relationship, so it was naturally a shock for him to dm her.

Eventually, I did apologize for what I said bc I could tell he was upset about it and I shouldn't have joked about that when he hasn't given me reason to not trust him.

76,1fzjntc,AITA for making my girlfriend pay for my flight when our hotel was practically free?,"So my girlfriend is really into F1 and wanted to make it to the Las Vegas Grand Prix this year. I’m not the biggest fan, but want to support her hobby so I got us a resort hotel for 4 nights which comes out to about $1128 total after resort fees.

The kicker is I pretty much got this hotel for free, I just have to attend a timeshare seminar for one of the 4 days we’re there. 

My girlfriend bought the tickets to the race which totaled $434.00. Right now we’re deliberating on the flights and I can’t help but feel conflicted in asking her to pay the entire $474.00 total in airplane tickets based on the commensurate value of the hotel. 
She insists I pay for at least half of the flights citing: “the hotel was free so it’s only fair you at least pay for your half.”

I’m currently getting ready to move to another state as well so finances are a little tough. I make decent money and can technically afford to pay for my half of the flights, but would rather not make any unnecessary expenses at the time.

77,1fzjjvg,AITA for claiming that all blood is disgusting/disturbing including period blood?,"I (17m) was on call my gf (16f) of 2.5 years and she asked me if I found period blood gross. Knowing this is an obvious trap and wanting to be supportive of her while also being honest told her that while I don't specifically find period blood gross I generally find blood gross and I'm disturbed by it. I then went on to give an example after her initial reaction of saying ""right..."" in a lowered tone. The example I gave was seeing an open wound would cause me to feel disgust because blood is gross to me, that's just the reaction I have.

She then went on to ask several questions about my distaste for the sight of blood and asked if she gave birth would I find that disgusting. I of course said no because my disgust for blood is far weaker than my love for her and our hypothetical child. She then asked why do I find period blood gross but childbirth not gross and I said again that birth creates life and it's more beautiful than the grossness of blood even though I don't necessarily find period blood gross.

I then compared the ingredients of a cake and cake itself to a period and pregnancy and explaining that I wouldn't call flour and eggs cake just because it can become that. Following this logic I wouldn't say that periods aren't life just because they can become life so I don't hold the same love and reverence for them. She then stated that I was claiming that she belonged in the kitchen because of the cake analogy and proceeded to text her friends about this and tell them I'm sexist.

All the while this entire conversation she is using a vocal fry and mild valley girl accent which I rarely see her do so I assume this is a strange bit she is doing. She then gets mad at me for laughing for thinking it's a bit because of the voice and what I perceived to be a weird conversation. In the end I hang up after her saying I need to respect period blood like her English teacher who consoled her in class today for her migraine and pain.

There’s a new girl on the squad who has been nothing but trouble since she joined. She’s constantly creating problems, whether it’s ignoring instructions, distracting the team, or even physically hurting others. I don’t think there’s been a single practice where someone hasn’t been hurt because of her.

On top of that, she goes out of her way to make rude comments about everyone’s appearance—skin color, weight, height, body type, hair—you name it.

Fast forward to today (10/8/2024). We had a game to cheer at, and she asked me if I could do her hair. I told her yes, but only if she got to the school between 7-7:30. She didn’t show up until 7:55 and threw a fit when I told her I didn’t have time to do her hair because she was late. Later that day, a teacher told me she was spreading lies about me to cover up her own behavior—like being late and breaking school rules (e.g., bringing a duffle bag into classrooms despite a no-bag policy).

79,1fzjdjv,AITA for not seeing my dad after 12 years?,"My (22F) story is a long one so I’ll try to sum it up as best as I possibly can. So, my dad is American, my mom is German and they met in the 90’s when my dad was stationed in Germany! They had my brother in Germany, moved back to the States permanently after leaving the military and had me!  Around the age of 10, my family began to fall apart. My German grandparents died and it left my mom with crazy bad anxiety and depression. 

After not being able to attend their funeral, my mom decided to divorce my dad. She was unhappy and sidenote, he had a porn addiction which wasn’t helping the situation. I was left with the decision to either stay with my dad and my brother in Oklahoma or go with my mother to Germany. I chose to be with my mom and thought that it’d be like visiting Germany. But it was nothing like that. Growing up their sucked and my childhood went dark! I was abused and bullied at home AND in school, leaving me with scars. 

Throughout the entire time of me suffering overseas, my dad only reached out to me on holidays or my birthday by sending me Christmas cards with 100 dollars in them. It would make me happy as a child but growing up, I realized that I needed more than that. I sent him a letter giving him my email and my phone number. He ever reached out in 12 years. I haven’t heard my dad’s voice in 12 years. 

We kept going back and forth via email and he ended up taking out his life insurance for me. I was confused as to why he did this? I asked him why and he later confessed that he had colon cancer and has already surpassed his life expectancy which was 2 years. He’s just waiting for his time to come. It broke me! But throughout this whole time, I had my boyfriend that I had met online. We spent hours together every single day for an entire year and he has helped me through sooooo much. I feel incredibly lucky to have such an amazing human being in my life. He keeps me sane.

So with the money my dad had sent, I bought tickets to America. I always wanted to go back but instead of visiting my dad first in Oklahoma, I decided to go to my boyfriend in LA.

I can hear him when he walks downstairs, so i’m sure he can hear me too. We don’t really interact with each other at all beside the courtesy half smile when we pass each other in the driveway.  

Long story short, I have psoriasis. I am currently experiencing a flare up and it is extremely uncomfortable. One of the only things that give me instant relief is a hot oatmeal bath. Two nights ago I woke up around 1am in extreme itching discomfort. I tried to ignore it but i just couldn’t. I decided to take a bath. I was in the bath for about an hour and filled it up one additional time to get it hot again. The next morning I woke up to a text from the guy downstairs saying that i woke him up with the running water right above him and i need to take my baths at a reasonable hour. I simply said “it’s a medical thing, i didn’t mean to wake you”. He texted back “what medical need could you possibly have that you need to take a bath at 1am??” I didn’t answer him and he texted again saying he would be speaking to the landlord about this. I didn’t respond again because i don’t need to explain anything to him regarding my medical history. also i’m not sure what he thinks the landlord will do. i’m allowed to take baths in my own home.

82,1fzioos,AITA for not cleaning my parents’ spare bedroom?,"Hi :) I’m F21, I live alone. I have my mom and dad ~50, and sister 18, and they all live together in the next town over.

They had a 3bd house custom built but it took years longer than expected. It was supposed to be done in 2019-2020, but it was finally done in 2022. I moved out for school in 2021 so I never actually got to live there.

One of the bedrooms was obviously supposed to be mine, but like I said I moved out before it was finished. Now it’s just their spare room for guests and some extra storage. I have a few things in there like spare clothes and stuff, but it’s like one drawer’s worth of items. 

My grandparents are visiting in a few days and they will be staying in there. My mom has asked me to come over and clean it up. I work a full time job in the nighttime and also have a side job for extra money. Of course I could make time, but there’s other factors.

So my sister uses “my” room for crafting and clothing storage sometimes. More of her stuff is in there, than mine. All the stuff to clean is hers. Also she lives there and doesn’t work so it would make more sense for her or my parents to clean it.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA for not cleaning my parents’ spare bedroom? Hi :) I’m F21, I live alone. I have my mom and dad ~50, and sister 18, and they all live together in the next town over.

They had a 3bd house custom built but it took years longer than expected. It was supposed to be done in 2019-2020, but it was finally done in 2022. I moved out for school in 2021 so I never actually got to live there.

One of the bedrooms was obviously supposed to be mine, but like I said I moved out before it was finished. Now it’s just their spare room for guests and some extra storage. I have a few things in there like spare clothes and stuff, but it’s like one drawer’s worth of items. 

My grandparents are visiting in a few days and they will be staying in there. My mom has asked me to come over and clean it up. I work a full time job in the nighttime and also have a side job for extra money. Of course I could make time, but there’s other factors.

So my sister uses “my” room for crafting and clothing storage sometimes. More of her stuff is in there, than mine. All the stuff to clean is hers. Also she lives there and doesn’t work so it would make more sense for her or my parents to clean it.

89,1fzhthy,WIBTA for not giving a ride to an elderly woman on my birthday?,"I (20F) and my mom (42F) just got into a huge fight about giving rides to a 70 year old woman (let’s call her Sandra) who is essentially a stranger. 

So some back story: about a month ago my dad (44M) was doing Uber for some extra money and ended up picking up Sandra who just became homeless and the drop off location no longer existed. My dad ended up calling my mom about the situation and my mom decided to take her in until she figured out a plan. Sandra lived with us for maybe 2 weeks until my mom found a shelter for her.

For the 2 weeks she lived with us, I didn’t have much encounters with her since I am a full time College student, who also works part time (usually right after classes), and I go to church every Sunday. So I basically only go home to eat and sleep. Anyways, my mom found a shelter for her but the problem is you can’t be at the shelter between 8:30a-5p, so Sandra needed something to do during the day. My mom decided that she could go to the senior center, which opens up at 8:30a, during that time period and then go back to the shelter. She also needs transportation to and from the senior center. 

My mom works Tuesdays-Thursdays 45 minutes away. So she needed someone else to pick Sandra up. I have school in the morning but on Tuesdays and Thursdays I have class at 10 am so technically I could pick her up, it’s just stressful every time because if I’m not on campus by 8:30a parking gets filled up very quickly and there’s a possibility I won’t find any parking anywhere, not even on the surrounding streets. Anyways I have been doing this almost every Tuesday and Thursday for the past few weeks except on the occasion that I have an early morning exam. I am exhausted every time bc I have to wake up at 7 am every day, go to school, sometimes pick her up, and also go to work, and then stay up super late doing my homework. 

My birthday is coming up and it falls on a Tuesday. Today I decided that I’m going to make it my relax day. I only have one class that day and I took off work so I can have the whole day to myself. I want to be able to sleep in for once, so I told my mom that I wasn’t going to pick up Sandra on my Birthday because it’s my birthday.

I also had a big sweet tooth, but generally sodas were my go to. I found out I had prediabetes , and needed to make some changes. 

Over the past 3+ years I completely stopped drinking soda, & drastically cut back on sweets. I ended up going from 180 lbs to 130 lbs in that time. FWIW - I never paraded around announcing I was doing it, it my private personal changes. I didn't feel like I needed to tell people. But, they do know I quit drinking soda cold turkey roughly 3ish years ago. 

For whatever reason the people around me are still shocked that I don't want soda, mainly my brother and a friend of mine. They drink it like I use to, I never told them to stop. Yet, anytime we sit down for a meal or to hang out someone will ask if I want a coke or something, I say no thank you. That's not enough, it's usually followed up with ""are you sure"" or ""it's been long enough, just treat yourself!"" I just have to keep saying no thanks until they stop. I feel like I've been polite long enough. I've even tried reminding them of my previous medical condition. So now, instead of saying ""no thanks"" I may say something like:

* If I stopped smoking, would you offer me a cigarette? - they will say but that's actually unhealthy 

* If I stopped doing [insert random illegal felony level drug here] would you offer me some? - they will be offended and angry because that's an extreme example

* Do you want me to get diabetes this time around and have something amputated? - they'll say one soda won't lead to that and will get angry b/c of the extreme example

* Sometimes I may just say that I think it tastes like the sickly sweet taste of rotting garbage - they get irritated because I said something gross

I've even reminded them that I did have a coke not that long ago, and couldn't drink more than one sip as it felt like acid pouring down my throat and I got heartburn right after. 

I don't know if this detail should or should not be included - but mostly everyone in my circle is extremely overweight, I use to eat like them and now I don't. As I got smaller and smaller, I noticed their behavior changing around me a lot.

92,1fzgd6u,AITA for telling Dad in front of everyone that I don't want to date family friend's son because I think he's manipulating me with his anxiety,"I am on the spectrum so it's hard for me to tell. My older sister is diagnosed with anxiety. I know anxiety can come in different forms but I believe (& my sister as well) that someone is using their ""anxiety"" to manipulate me. I am a girl. Guy named Trey is the son of Dad's friend. Sometimes he'd come around and we became friends, then he asked me out and we dated for a month. We go to the same school, this is the first year we had classes together. He makes it well known that he has anxiety to me and everyone around us. We have 4 classes together - in 2 we sit at the same table. 

Here's the issue - I suspect that Trey is faking his anxiety or using it as manipulation. In the two classes where we sit close, he always suddenly starts breathing really heavily and working up a worried expression, burying his face in his hands and shaky breath. It lasts for like 20 seconds, then repeats about 20 mins later. I know to be polite and ask if he's okay but it just feels very off. From knowing my sister she seems genuinely scared in panic attacks. Trey doesn't seem scared he just seems... calmer immediately after someone gives him empathy? Sometimes I even see a smirk. Or he'll suddenly go into an ""anxiety attack"", saying ""it feels like the world is caving in"" over and over and then... \*RUN\* over to adjacent tables to put his head on their desks and get their sympathy. Kinda distracting imo but he doesn't leave until someone asks him if he's alright. It just is kinda off like usually in anxiety attacks you'd be just trying to get through it so I'd find it hard to immediately think about running to adjacent tables and making it known. I thought most people don't want others to know when these panic attacks happen. He keeps doing it more and more, it's like a daily occurrence by now. He only started after we began dating.

In the two classes we aren't sitting close, he will never have a single anxiety attack. He'll be loudly talking to friends. It just is kinda off because his behavior isn't ever consistent.

EDIT: Wow this blew up a lot more than I expected. Thanks for all the support. I talked to my dad about it this morning and he’s on my side now. I think I can understand why he was mad at me at first since I had never mentioned Trey’s anxiety thing before and my sister has anxiety which makes him a little sensitive to that topic especially if I’m accusing someone of faking. I’m just grateful for the help and I appreciate it from everyone of you :) ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-09,"AITA for telling Dad in front of everyone that I don't want to date family friend's son because I think he's manipulating me with his anxiety I am on the spectrum so it's hard for me to tell. My older sister is diagnosed with anxiety. I know anxiety can come in different forms but I believe (& my sister as well) that someone is using their ""anxiety"" to manipulate me. I am a girl. Guy named Trey is the son of Dad's friend. Sometimes he'd come around and we became friends, then he asked me out and we dated for a month. We go to the same school, this is the first year we had classes together. He makes it well known that he has anxiety to me and everyone around us. We have 4 classes together - in 2 we sit at the same table. 

Here's the issue - I suspect that Trey is faking his anxiety or using it as manipulation. In the two classes where we sit close, he always suddenly starts breathing really heavily and working up a worried expression, burying his face in his hands and shaky breath. It lasts for like 20 seconds, then repeats about 20 mins later. I know to be polite and ask if he's okay but it just feels very off. From knowing my sister she seems genuinely scared in panic attacks. Trey doesn't seem scared he just seems... calmer immediately after someone gives him empathy? Sometimes I even see a smirk. Or he'll suddenly go into an ""anxiety attack"", saying ""it feels like the world is caving in"" over and over and then... \*RUN\* over to adjacent tables to put his head on their desks and get their sympathy. Kinda distracting imo but he doesn't leave until someone asks him if he's alright. It just is kinda off like usually in anxiety attacks you'd be just trying to get through it so I'd find it hard to immediately think about running to adjacent tables and making it known. I thought most people don't want others to know when these panic attacks happen. He keeps doing it more and more, it's like a daily occurrence by now. He only started after we began dating.

In the two classes we aren't sitting close, he will never have a single anxiety attack. He'll be loudly talking to friends. It just is kinda off because his behavior isn't ever consistent.

93,1fzg5s2,AITA for not being proud of my sister? ,"I (33f) and my sister (39f, chosen not blood) were in an argument and she’s furious. 

Background: I’ve known her since I was 13 and she’s always made poor financial decisions. My parents would constantly bail her out because they (her and ex partner, my bio sibling) would be behind on all their bills. 

Fast forward, she made the best decision to dump my bio sibling and buy a house 13 years ago. She continuously would be late on her mortgage over the years because she would rather have $36 balloons and a leather couch. 

The issue: She asked me what I thought about her taking a 2nd mortgage on her house to buy herself a new truck and make repairs on her house. She was very proud of herself to get her credit up enough to get pre-approved. She can’t get approved for a car loan. 

I was honest and said I felt it was a huge mistake to risk her kids home for a vehicle. That she needs to get herself a sedan to drive until she betters her position to get a truck and can consistently meet her bills. 

The flood gates open about how I’m an AH, and I should be telling her how proud I am of her. She can make her bills and things just happened. If she had to drive a sedan her mental health would spiral. She’s currently 2 months behind on her mortgage due to a hot water heater.

I don't want to have another thing to worry about on my wedding day, and despite it causing a rift in the family, I just... don't want my half brother there. He won't make it better.

My fiance smokes it sometimes, too. My fiance was trying to bond with him over that, and then my brother was arguing about how my fiance was putting his family in danger by using it, which... he also does.

one day he just proposed to her saying that he really liked her, and that if she didn't accept to cheat on me and be his gf, it was over. So she stopped talking with him. 

it's been 1 year from that. It started with a message, my GF told me and she was very open about it. At first she said she didn't want to talk to him again but asked me if I would be mad if she did, and I said that it was fine if it was just to talk a bit about idk what. Tbh I didn't wanted to show that it bothered me since we had an argument about this guy, what he did and how it made me feel really bad, and I let her know about it. 

Few weeks later and they've been talking pretty much, my SO is not open about it anymore (Which is ok, and I don't want to ask much to respect her privacy too). 
 The ""I think I don't wanna talk to him"" became a ""We just talk about dumb stuff"" 
The ""I don't wanna hang out with him in person"" became ""I'm going out with him next Sunday"", etc

I told her that it was weird. Specially since Jerry said (again) that ""he still loved her and couldn't find a girl like her"". 

 It really bothers me that they're talking and hanging out, I guess the question is, Am I over reacting? There's a story between the three.

105,1g04vwl,AITA for ignoring my friend?,"
This is the best title I could come up with, bear with me so I can explain it better. I (17 M) just started “college” (won’t go into how the education system works in my country right now but it’s close enough) and I’ve made a new friend, which I’ll call Katherine (17 F), that I spend a lot of time with. I kinda like her romantically but I don’t think it’s the same for her and that’s fine by me, I just enjoy spending time with someone who I think is funny and smart. We also share most of our classes, so we generally go together to class and talk on the way.

I’ve got a friend from high school, let’s call him Charlie (17 M), and he’s been probably my best friend for a good amount of time now. He’s the one who supported me when my gf broke up with me. And I’ve supported him when he got rejected by the girl he had a crush on for most of high school. However, he’s sometimes annoying and gets on my nerves. I’m not saying it in a mean way, it’s just that he talks loudly and generally can’t be trusted with doing the right choice. 

Yesterday, I was walking with Katherine to our physics class, we were talking about Arabic (she speaks it and I’m learning it), and I saw Charlie. So I waved cause my brain went into “hey I know that dude!”. He comes and starts talking. I thought it was a bit rude to just cut me off and start a new conversation but ok. I let him finish his sentence, give a small answer, and then continue what I was saying to Katherine. At this point she realizes we went the wrong way, so I turn around with her and tell Charlie something it was nice seeing him around. He follows us, saying he doesn’t have classes right now so he wants to talk with me. Welp ok. I continue talking to Katherine, seeing that she is visibly kind of put off by how Charlie is acting, and then here’s the really annoying part: he grabs me by my shirt and pulls me back so I walk next to him instead of her. In the moment I just walked back next to her, but I wanted to scream “WTF m8? What do you think you’re doing? I’m talking to someone!”. He then left us at some point as we continued walking to our class.

When I tried bringing the subject up he dismissed me, saying I had no chance since she wanted “a tall, strong guy with a buzz cut and a moustache”. Which is something she told me once, and lots of things have happened that make me think that I still have a chance. I think it’s irrelevant since she’s, more importantly, my friend, and simply trying to take over a conversation you’re not a part of is a rude thing to do. He didn’t let me answer so I haven’t got the chance to say that to him. I’m just really annoyed by him lately.

My mom and I had taken a plane ride to Florida so we could meet them there. The trip was supposed to be from Sunday to Friday, but we had to leave Wednesday morning because of Hurricane Milton, which I was upset about, but after I had my little moment, I was ready to leave and was actually glad to. 

Since our flights got canceled, we had to buy a rental car and drive around 12 1/2 hours to get to my Nana's house so that we could spend the night, then drive to our house which was another 4 hours away. I get car sick really easily, so I tried to sleep at the beginning of the ride. Eventually, around 4 or 5 hours into the drive, we were gonna stop at Starbucks and my nana was driving.

109,1g03601,AITA communal restrooms,"Hello there, I am a university student in my last semester. I’ve recently had to move into a new dorm for the fall semester and I noticed after a month or so that my roommate across from my room hasn’t been cleaning the restroom. My action was mainly due to him leaving stains on and around the toilet seat, the rim, and even other parts of the toilet. I became uncomfortable, which led to me having to use the restroom in school facilities. This isn’t too bad since I live in campus. Right after addressing the following he told me that he has a medical condition and I felt bad. I was caught off guard and apologized; he said it was okay. I’ve had mix thoughts about the situation since he’s probably going through a lot but I don’t want to be cleaning for two people for the rest of the semester.

Now, it’s apart of housing policy that we both share responsibility of the restroom since it’s shared. However, I have been cleaning the restroom since late August with the exception of last week. This is due to me addressing the issue on September 26th. I told him that I could do the current week since it was about to be the weekend and he would have some time to buy the equipment. He said he would do it but fast forward into Week 7 he has not cleaned the restroom. I’m a bit annoyed since I am somewhat obligated to clean for others when we both use the restroom. I can’t bring it up the issue again since I am very timid. Also, unlike me, he does have small talk with my other roommates so I’d feel even more like ostracized if I do bring it up.

Also, I’m the only one that has provided soap, toilet paper, and trash bags till now. He stopped using my toilet paper but I’ve noticed that he likes to bring waste from his room into the trash can located in the restroom. It stinks up the restroom, and it puts me in an inconvenient situation since I replace the bags.

My action was mainly due to him leaving stains on and around the toilet seat, the rim, and even other parts of the toilet. I became uncomfortable, which led to me having to use the restroom in school facilities. This isn’t too bad since I live in campus. Right after addressing the following he told me that he has a medical condition and I felt bad. I was caught off guard and apologized; he said it was okay. I’ve had mix thoughts about the situation since he’s probably going through a lot but I don’t want to be cleaning for two people for the rest of the semester.

Now, it’s apart of housing policy that we both share responsibility of the restroom since it’s shared. However, I have been cleaning the restroom since late August with the exception of last week. This is due to me addressing the issue on September 26th. I told him that I could do the current week since it was about to be the weekend and he would have some time to buy the equipment. He said he would do it but fast forward into Week 7 he has not cleaned the restroom. I’m a bit annoyed since I am somewhat obligated to clean for others when we both use the restroom. I can’t bring it up the issue again since I am very timid. Also, unlike me, he does have small talk with my other roommates so I’d feel even more like ostracized if I do bring it up.

Also, I’m the only one that has provided soap, toilet paper, and trash bags till now. He stopped using my toilet paper but I’ve noticed that he likes to bring waste from his room into the trash can located in the restroom. It stinks up the restroom, and it puts me in an inconvenient situation since I replace the bags.

110,1g02yq5,AITA for telling my boyfriend to stop pointing out that I’m wearing his clothes in front of others?,"My boyfriend (M27) and I (M26) have been together for over 6 months now. Let’s call him James. For context, he’s white (European), and I’m Black (African). While this isn’t a factor in our relationship, I think it’s relevant to what I’m feeling right now.

James and I have a really healthy, loving relationship. He’s kind, and supportive, and we communicate well about almost everything. However, there’s one thing that’s been bothering me lately, and I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into it.

Before we met, James had put on a bit of weight, so some of his old clothes didn’t fit anymore. He generously offered them to me, and although I’ve never been super comfortable with sharing clothes (probably something I picked up from my upbringing), I accepted. His clothes are nice, and it’s fun to mix up my style every now and then.

The issue is that James keeps bringing up the fact that I’m wearing his clothes—constantly, okay maybe at least five times now. At first, he would mention it casually when it was just the two of us, but more recently, he’s started doing it in front of other people.

For example, one time while I was wearing his jumper, he asked my housemate, *“Doesn’t my jumper look good on him?”...* while I was standing there, and I just smiled. Another time, one of his friends complimented my outfit, and James chimed in with, *“Dressed by James.”* It didn’t bother me too much at first, but it’s becoming more frequent, and I’m starting to feel uneasy about it.

The most recent instance happened a few days ago. I was running late to meet James and some friends for dinner, so I grabbed the nearest sweater I could find in the closet (I’d slept over at his since I work remotely, so most of my clothes were his). When I arrived at the restaurant, the first thing he said was, *“Is that my sweater? Looking nice, babes.”*

Honestly, it kinda annoyed me lol, but I was already stressed from work and a delayed train, so I wasn’t sure if I was just projecting my frustration.

What’s been nagging at me is this: I don’t want to make a big deal out of something small, but as the Black partner in a relationship with a white partner, I worry that this could be feeding into a stereotype—that I’m dependent on him, or that there’s some kind of power imbalance. The reality is that we have a very equal, loving relationship, and I don’t rely on his clothes. I have my own. It’s just the frequency of him pointing it out that’s starting to make me uncomfortable.

We communicate openly about everything else, but for some reason, I haven’t brought this up with him yet. Maybe it’s because I’m not sure if it’s just my own insecurities talking or if it’s something worth addressing.

So, AITA for feeling uneasy about this and wanting to bring it up, or am I overthinking the situation?

Edit 1: I’ve taken some time to think about you guys’ take on this. And thank you for making me see this differently :). The thing that I’ve had to wrestle with the past few months is how to perceive minor aggressions and not conflate them with bigger issues like racism. Your opinions have helped me frame this better; James is probably just teasing like he usually does and doesn’t mean anything bad by his comments. I will talk to him after work today.

113,1g01xhc,AITA for being angry about my (42f) husbands (45m) drug use? ,"I have been with my husband for 17 years, married for 14. Relevant background: me best friend died of a drug overdose in high school. She was experimenting for one of her first times, and was in a coma before doctors advised there was no brain activity. It messed me up a while and changed a lot of things in my life. I'm okay with marijuana usage and maybe occasional mushrooms, but that's about where it ends. Everything else is triggering and I've dumped boyfriends for it in the past. 

My husband and I have been going through difficult times lately and have basically been acting as roommates. We have 2 kids (6m, 8f). With all the distance between us and his lack of emotional support, I decided to go through his phone to see if he was involved with other women. Instead, I found messages that he recently spend hundreds of dollars on coke. 

I got very upset and confronted him about it. He basically told me I'm overreacting and that coke isn't that serious of a drug. He also told me he's been doing it ""occasionally"" for the entirety of our relationship. This caused even more strain. I told him I wanted to separate. He said he thinks he can fix it. I moved into the guest room. 

After 6 months it seems like he's trying to fix some things. He listens to me more when I talk which I guess is his version of emotional support. He helps around the house and is mostly a good dad. He recently went on a business trip and when he got back, I looked through his phone again only to find that he bought another large amount of coke while he was away. 

I feel like this is so disrespectful of my feelings and thoughts. I feel like it's disrespectful to our children because lots of bad things can happen whether it's heart issues or what he buys is laced with something. I know he's going to act like since he didn't have it around the kids, it shouldn't be a big deal. But he has known since before we dated about my friend, how it affected me, and my stance on anything stronger than weed basically. 

Am I the asshole for even considering leaving an otherwise decent person for this? The lying and the crossing of boundaries? How do I even approach the situation or start the convo? Am I overreacting and is coke really not that big of a deal? I just can't get past all the what ifs. What if the kids found it and tasted or smelled it? What if I was driving him with it and got in an accident or pulled over and police found it? I could lose my job, my kids, etc. What if he got a bad batch laced with fentanyl or it just finally took a toll on his heart after over two decades of use? I feel lost any help would be wonderful.

My one friend is increadibly smart and a great artist but, to put it nicely, she is not doing good with our studies. Almost all our projects/ exams are teamwork. Until now I always worked with her but there are issues.

In every exam she does her work last minute. Most her work needs to be redone, so everyone else doesn't get to sleep

IF she redoes it herself, she always does it incorrect again, no matter howoften you tell her how to do it

She uses incompatible programs, says she won't do it again, then does it again

She doesn't show up to university unless we tell her to. When we tell her to go but can't come ourselves (for sickness, etc), she finds an excuse to not go

She does not tell us she won't go. There have been instances where I told her I would go sick if she didn't and still she didn't tell me

Her work is bad. Last time she didn't draw crutial details such as handrails, frames for the windows, flooring, entire inside walls of the building, etc

She once gave me something incorrect at 10pm, 10 hours before hand in. She said she couldn't redo it in the little time and went to sleep. I redid it

She doesn't work at home when she came to uni that day

116,1g019kc,AITA for refusing to stay with my in laws forever,"My husband (34) and I (29) got married shortly after meeting on Instagram. We are from different countries, have different religions, and grew up in different cultures, but we get along very well. Before marriage, everything was great, and I was a happy, healthy person. However, after our wedding, my in-laws came to the U.S. on a visitor visa for the ceremony and ended up staying with us. They’re supposed to stay for six months at a time due to visa restrictions.

My FIL constantly pressures us to have a baby, even though my husband and I aren’t ready. He makes comments about my biological clock, and I feel overwhelmed by their presence. My MIL is emotionally dependent on my husband since my FIL neglects her unless he needs something. She’s anxious and unhappy, despite my husband constantly trying to make her feel better. Their lifestyle—unhealthy diet, smoking, and keeping the house uncomfortably warm—affects my well-being. I often avoid going downstairs because they dominate the common spaces, spending all day in the living room on their phones.

Before moving to the U.S., I was the happiest person I knew, but now I feel trapped. I drink daily, barely eat, and my physical and mental health have deteriorated. I’ve gained weight, struggle with stress-related stomach issues, and take medication to cope. I try to stay away from my in-laws to maintain some peace, but when they’re here, I feel depressed and uncomfortable. They don’t respect my privacy, and their presence disrupts my daily routine.

I’ve spoken to my husband about this, but he expects me to ""deal with it."" He feels indebted to his parents and refuses to ask them not to stay for long periods. While he has asked them to stop pressuring us about having a baby and be cleaner, the situation hasn’t improved much. I’m willing to compromise and have them stay for 1-2 months a year, but I don’t want them raising any future children due to their emotional instability.

My husband wants a baby within a year, but I’m unsure if it’s the right time. I believe we could have a better relationship with his parents if we only visited during holidays, but he doesn’t accept this suggestion. Aside from this issue, my husband and I have a good relationship. I love him and don’t want to leave him, but I feel like I’m losing myself. 

I married my husband because we are compatible, but I’m struggling with the expectation to live with his parents, who come from a different culture. They have a nice home in their country and are capable of traveling, yet they choose to stay with us for long periods. I need to resolve this before I turn 30, so I can return to being the person I used to be. People say I’m not trying to adjust, but I don't want to adjust further than I already have.

Before moving to the U.S., I was the happiest person I knew, but now I feel trapped. I drink daily, barely eat, and my physical and mental health have deteriorated. I’ve gained weight, struggle with stress-related stomach issues, and take medication to cope. I try to stay away from my in-laws to maintain some peace, but when they’re here, I feel depressed and uncomfortable. They don’t respect my privacy, and their presence disrupts my daily routine.

I’ve spoken to my husband about this, but he expects me to ""deal with it."" He feels indebted to his parents and refuses to ask them not to stay for long periods. While he has asked them to stop pressuring us about having a baby and be cleaner, the situation hasn’t improved much. I’m willing to compromise and have them stay for 1-2 months a year, but I don’t want them raising any future children due to their emotional instability.

My husband wants a baby within a year, but I’m unsure if it’s the right time. I believe we could have a better relationship with his parents if we only visited during holidays, but he doesn’t accept this suggestion. Aside from this issue, my husband and I have a good relationship. I love him and don’t want to leave him, but I feel like I’m losing myself. 

I married my husband because we are compatible, but I’m struggling with the expectation to live with his parents, who come from a different culture. They have a nice home in their country and are capable of traveling, yet they choose to stay with us for long periods. I need to resolve this before I turn 30, so I can return to being the person I used to be. People say I’m not trying to adjust, but I don't want to adjust further than I already have.

117,1g017gp,WIBTA if I throw a party at my house and invite a girl my roommate doesn't like?,"Backstory: I (23W) live in a house with two sisters, Liz (25W) and Micah (20W). We've lived together for over a year, but Liz and I lived together two years prior. For a long time, Micah and Liz were best friends with this girl Julia (22W). They're from the same hometown and Julia even dated Liz and Micah's brother for about two years or so. They're no longer together but everyone remained friends. 

I was introduced to Julia through Liz three years ago because I thought she was cute (i'm bi). I slid in her DMs and she invited me to a party at her place. Liz and Micah were there. One thing led to another, then Julia and I were flirting, I got too wasted to drive home, I crashed at her place and we made out in her bed after the party. The day after we decided to stay friends. 

Now, we're still friends, Micah and Julia are still besties, but Liz and Julia aren't friends. It started after Liz started dating this guy Mark (28M). Mark is a med school student with no car, no license, he can't cook and he barely cleans his apartment with 3 cats. He has extremely crude humor and drinks a lot. Me, Micah, and Julia have said to each other that we're not very fond of him. One day, Julia was drunk and told Liz she thinks Mark isn't a good guy for her. Liz got pissed with her and was already mad at her for a bunch of other reasons. She decided not to be friends with Julia anymore. Liz even had a meeting with me and Micah to say she doesn't even want Julia in the house anymore. I told her that wasn't fair because Julia is Micah and I's friend. Long story short, we compromised and said if Liz isn't there Julia can come over but we won't invite her over if Liz is there (she's at Mark's most of the time anyways).

Here's my problem: I want to throw costume party for Halloween at the house. I want to invite Julia and a ton of other people, so I texted Liz and let her know I was inviting her and I would understand if she didn't want to be at house. Liz was PISSED. She said I was ignoring her boundaries and said she thought we were friends. I told her part of having roommates is that you won't like everyone your roomie is friends with. I told her there's folks she brings over often that I'm not fond of (literally just Mark but I didn't say that) but I just deal with it because you have the right to have guests. I still plan on throwing the party but Liz is still pissed about it.

119,1g00pfk,AITA for wanting a gift on our wedding anniversary?,"My husband (M48) and I (F37) have a rather big wedding anniversary approaching.
Around here it's usually celebrated with a party and quite a few other traditions. Just to give the picture, it's usually something that a couple would end up spending quite a bit of money on.

We are both on the introverted side, my husband moreso than me, so we have opted for a quiet family meal at home with some good food and wine, our small son and my parents. The weekend after the actual anniversary day, we've been planning to go to a nice hotel and a fancy dinner. We both like eating out, so this is our only celebration.

I brought up gifts for each other, as I am planning something for him, and would like to be somewhere near his idea and budget. He was completely surprised and said that he considers the hotel and dinner our shared gift.

He is not the romantic type, it's always been like this, but he shows affection and love in other ways. It's just that for this very special occassion, I would really like him to consider me and think of something. Not necessarily expensive, though we are not struggling financially. 

So, AITA for asking for a gift from him?
