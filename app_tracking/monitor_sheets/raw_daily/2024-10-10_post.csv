0,1g0cxor,AITA for joking a person in drag as charli xcx voice sounded deeper than usual? ,"Tonight I went to the sweat tour (charli xcx,troye,shygirl) concert with some friends and we loved it. One thing I feel awful about that I cant stop replaying in my head is that when we got there there was a person in drag as charli, they looked amazing and I asked for a picture. When I went up to them and their friend I decided to joking be like “omg hi charli can i get a pic” like being silly and playing that theyre really charlie. They said of course, they made a joke and I stupidly was like “oh wow charli your voice sounds deeper than normal!”. I realize now how bad that comes off as a cis woman approaching them in drag, and their friend immediately was like “no, no, we dont say things like that, that was transphobic”. Immediately apologized and looked back at the person in drag and apologized to them as well, but she said its okay “ill still take a oic with you. “. 

I took the pic and walked away stunned because honestly I didn’t mean it like that at all. I was just trying to make light of being in drag at a concert and playing along with the fun of it. I guess i thought it was okay to make jokes like that because I’ve seen so many drag queens and queer people make those jokes with one another. I honestly feel really bad and I regret not explaining how I totally didn’t mean it that way. 

I don’t even know what I was thinking and just bc I am a queer woman thats doesn’t let me just make jokes at that sort of expense. Was it really that bad of a joke to make ? I guess I was wondering about the opinions drag queens or other gender bending artists feel about receiving jokes from people who aren’t trans. I really hope it didn’t make them feel bad. I feel so stupid and I will def be more mindful with those types of things. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-10-10,"AITA for joking a person in drag as charli xcx voice sounded deeper than usual?
