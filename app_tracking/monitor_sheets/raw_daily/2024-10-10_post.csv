0,1g0cxor,AITA for joking a person in drag as charli xcx voice sounded deeper than usual? ,"Tonight I went to the sweat tour (charli xcx,troye,shygirl) concert with some friends and we loved it. One thing I feel awful about that I cant stop replaying in my head is that when we got there there was a person in drag as charli, they looked amazing and I asked for a picture. When I went up to them and their friend I decided to joking be like ‚Äúomg hi charli can i get a pic‚Äù like being silly and playing that theyre really charlie. They said of course, they made a joke and I stupidly was like ‚Äúoh wow charli your voice sounds deeper than normal!‚Äù. I realize now how bad that comes off as a cis woman approaching them in drag, and their friend immediately was like ‚Äúno, no, we dont say things like that, that was transphobic‚Äù. Immediately apologized and looked back at the person in drag and apologized to them as well, but she said its okay ‚Äúill still take a oic with you. ‚Äú. 

I took the pic and walked away stunned because honestly I didn‚Äôt mean it like that at all. I was just trying to make light of being in drag at a concert and playing along with the fun of it. I guess i thought it was okay to make jokes like that because I‚Äôve seen so many drag queens and queer people make those jokes with one another. I honestly feel really bad and I regret not explaining how I totally didn‚Äôt mean it that way. 

I don‚Äôt even know what I was thinking and just bc I am a queer woman thats doesn‚Äôt let me just make jokes at that sort of expense. Was it really that bad of a joke to make ? I guess I was wondering about the opinions drag queens or other gender bending artists feel about receiving jokes from people who aren‚Äôt trans. I really hope it didn‚Äôt make them feel bad.

1,1g0qtx7,AITA For Not Going To Varsity's Game Because of One Girl?,"Hi everyone. I'll try to keep it short and sweet so as to not take up the word cap. I'm a freshman playing volleyball for JV(Junior Varsity) and I've been playing since middle school and under the same school since middle school. I've been playing with a girl I'll call Meela. She's a very annoying person, always nitpicking what others are doing, and very two-faced. When we first tried out, we were on the freshman team she never wanted to talk to others. 



So when we were moved up to JV, I was planning to be their setter until the old one came back and she put on the team for whatever reason. I hated our season. Lots of fighting and rumors Parents didn't like Meela that much and neither did my mom for the same reasons; rude, loud, and always telling people what to do. She constantly told me how to set and how to serve. Two things she sucks at. I've had many instances of me getting at her during games. At first, I told her to stop telling me what to do. I got pulled over after the game with my mom and told to be more respectful. I honestly blocked out everything she said after she laughed in my face when I told her how I felt. And after a few more games of Meela pissing me off, I yelled at her at one game and just honestly detached myself from the team except for a few people. I felt like I was forced to apologize. 



During our last game, we lost 2 games in a row. I clapped and tried to cheer up the team and Meela told me to stop and started arguing with me talking about how I was annoying her I just told her, and I quote ""Don't Meela don't! I don't have time for you!"" I raised my voice. All THREE COACHES SEEING HER AND FACING HER STARTED TO YELL AT ME! I just went mute the whole time and just watched as they forced me to be on the side the whole time. I didn't care for it or the team anymore. When we shagged balls for the last game, she tried to talk. For the sake of myself and for her safety I didn't talk to her so for 30 seconds straight her voice was in my ear asking to talk, body to body. I said stop and she kept going at me. Then she left saying fuck you and I said fuck you too. And started to trash talk me behind me. 



Now she's on varsity to show that being a ""team player"" is what gets me on varsity. And she got to play with them. We were all expected to come. I said I didn't want to go and I had no reason to see a girl who could barely pass play. They played and lost and now their season is over.



My coaches and friends say I'm an AH for not going to Vasity's game because Meela was playing. I honestly feel like I am one, but I could care less.

2,1g0qj9q,AITA for holding a grudge against an SSO?,"I (15M) go to a new school, which opened this year, where the transportation, particularly the carpool line, is a bit shambolic, with kids having to run after their cars as staff and SSOs (school security officer) just keep telling cars to move forward, even when they see their kid and it makes most sense to stop. As such, typically SSOs are getting kids to move up to the front of the pavement near the carpool line. That's where I come in. 

Me mates and I were talking and an SSO tells us to move up front as we were a bit back in the pavement. As we start doing so, I almost bump into a lady I didn't see coming.

I got pissed but kept me chin up and didn't do anything, but the remark's been scratching at me head since then, as I felt mad that she felt the need to bad mouth my parents. I told my dad about it, and he says I should calmly bring it up to her again tomorrow, which I also thought would be the thing to do. The thing is, since I couldn't make out what she said after ""probably"", I'm only assuming she said something negative about my parents since she seemed generally unhappy with me by the end, which makes it seem a bit unfair for me to hold this grudge. Even more so, I know she's just trying to do her job, and dealing with people my age, let alone that many, can definitely be a handful.

3,1g0q9wk,AITA for not getting a perm?,"AITA for not wanting to get a perm for my sister's wedding?

I (28f) am supposed to be my sister's (26f) maid of honor. We are and always have been super close and have a great relationship, so I have no idea, how this could have escalated this badly.
I have long, very straight hair, that doesn't hold a curl for longer than 2 hours at most, no matter what products or tools you use. It also not colored but completely virgin hair, which also makes it less likely to hold onto any kind of curls. I love curls, but I've accepted my fate and don't see a point in spending a long time to try and style it, just for everything to be gone an hour later.
My sister insists on all women in the wedding having their hair styled with curls. I can and would let the best hairstylist ever curl my hair - I know it won't hold up during the day, and my sister knows it, too. 
Because of that she has gotten the idea into her head, that I should just get a perm, so I would be able to wear my hair curly at her wedding. I don't want to do that?? I have several years of length in my hair and a perm would mean I'd have to keep up this very time intensive style I didn't even chose or chop my perm-damaged hair of afterwards?

I'd do a lot to make my sister happy and I want her to have a lovely wedding, but I think her demand is absolutely ridiculous. She goes on and on about how I want to ruin her perfect day and how I'd only do that, because I'm jealous of her getting married before me (not true at all).

4,1g0q9vg,AITA for Not Tipping,"I go to a Bruegger's Bagels about once every other week, a very suburban Bagel chain that serves Bagels, Bagels as Sandwiches, and a array of other breakfast goods.

Today I got in there around 1:30, 30 minutes before closing. I'm the only customer, it's a small location, with two people behind the counter.

I order two bagels with cream cheese, toasted.

The person manning the cash register rings me up, I input my debit card, I don't tip. They hand me the bag a minute later, I say thanks, and leave out the door.

I get home and open the bag, and the bagels are poorly toasted (ie, only slightly warm, and my house is 3 minutes away from the location) and also not cut. It's a silly thing to write on the internet about, the food is totally fine to eat and it tastes mostly good, but it strikes me as a sloppy job.

First, I jump to the conclusion that I didn't tip, and they were like ""fuck this guy"" and did the bare minimum.

My personal stance on tipping is that if I'm standing at a cashier and ordering food that's going to come out a moment or a few moments later tipping is totally off the table. It kinda pisses me off when some places turn the card reader around and it says 25% tip as the base.

If I had ordered something complex, or something where a person was going to put effort into that item, I would have tipped. But what I ordered strikes me as almost the simplest item on the menu to curate.

I think the reason why I'm writing on this form about this is because this isn't the first time this has happened at this location. In previous months, again where I was not tipping and ordering the same order, there were similar small errors, mostly around the bagel not being toasted (usually not at all), poorly cut or not cut, etc.

I also thought about the angle of ""it's late in the day for this person's shift, perhaps they are just really tired and are missing the mark"" which is somewhat understandable but it's shitty for me and my experience buying a overpriced bagel. But I thought back to the incidents that occurred over the past few months and thought that I might be the asshole not throwing them a extra couple of dollars.

Right now my mindset is that I'm just going to avoid that joint and use other breakfast food options, and to also just get my own bagel supplies from the grocery store. I stopped going to that Bruegger's after being previously annoyed at their service, and thought to give them another go recently, but I think it's over with them.

As an aside, this is a non-conclusive list of scenarios where I would totally tip:

1. I sit down and food is brought to me / a server comes to my table.  
2. I am given advice on what I should do/order.  
3. I know/see the individual regularly and we have good interactions.  
4. There's some type of 'skill' or craftsmanship put into the product.  
5. I spend a extended period of time with that person for that service (ie, a Uber ride).

I used to work in the service industry, in my opinion it's almost always a shitty place to be. I personally think that tipping shouldn't exist because it's mostly a tool for corporations and small businesses to pass on costs to the customer rather than provide people a stable working income. It's just bad for the working class in my opinion.

7,1g0plhq,AITA for buying a portable AC/Humidifier?,"AITA for buying a portable AC for my room?

for context, I (21F) live in a college apartment with 2 other girls around my age. The thermostat we have controls the entire apartment. For the first month of living there, my roommates and I couldn‚Äôt agree on a temperature. We went back and forth between turning it up and down, but we weren‚Äôt discussing it. For context, I run very hot, my comfort level is like 65-66. However, i understand that is really cold for other people. I was willing to compromise up to 69, because thats about as high as it can go for me to be comfortable in the house. However, the problem arises when the AC was completely shut off without consulting me. The reason I was given was to save money, because we do pay the utility bill excluded from our rent. This made the apartment uncomfortable for me, as there was no air flow, and it got uncomfortably hot in my room. My room would heat up even more because the sun shines right into my room. I tried to turn the AC back on quite a few times, and each time it was turned right back off before my room could even cool down again. Instead of fighting about this, I got a portable air conditioner/dehumidifier for my room only. I figured this would solve the issue, because then I could keep my room at the 65-66 that I liked, and they could keep the central AC off as they liked. I got a text yesterday though, saying it was frustrating and inconsiderate of me to get a portable AC without talking to them about it, because they do not want a ‚Äúsuper high electric bill.‚Äù I have looked at the billing statements from when they turned off the AC, and they saved no money from doing so. I do not know if my AC will significantly impact the utility bill, but as its only cooling one room, and only when I am physically in the room (i turn it off to go to work, school, gym, etc) I do not see how this is an issue, as we haven‚Äôt even seen the billing statement for from the time I bought the unit. I also don‚Äôt see why I have to consult them about buying the unit, when they don‚Äôt have to consult me about turning off the AC and leaving it off indefinitely.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for buying a portable AC/Humidifier?

For the first month of living there, my roommates and I couldn‚Äôt agree on a temperature. We went back and forth between turning it up and down, but we weren‚Äôt discussing it. For context, I run very hot, my comfort level is like 65-66. However, i understand that is really cold for other people. I was willing to compromise up to 69, because thats about as high as it can go for me to be comfortable in the house. However, the problem arises when the AC was completely shut off without consulting me. The reason I was given was to save money, because we do pay the utility bill excluded from our rent. This made the apartment uncomfortable for me, as there was no air flow, and it got uncomfortably hot in my room. My room would heat up even more because the sun shines right into my room. I tried to turn the AC back on quite a few times, and each time it was turned right back off before my room could even cool down again. Instead of fighting about this, I got a portable air conditioner/dehumidifier for my room only. I figured this would solve the issue, because then I could keep my room at the 65-66 that I liked, and they could keep the central AC off as they liked. I got a text yesterday though, saying it was frustrating and inconsiderate of me to get a portable AC without talking to them about it, because they do not want a ‚Äúsuper high electric bill.‚Äù I have looked at the billing statements from when they turned off the AC, and they saved no money from doing so. I do not know if my AC will significantly impact the utility bill, but as its only cooling one room, and only when I am physically in the room (i turn it off to go to work, school, gym, etc) I do not see how this is an issue, as we haven‚Äôt even seen the billing statement for from the time I bought the unit. I also don‚Äôt see why I have to consult them about buying the unit, when they don‚Äôt have to consult me about turning off the AC and leaving it off indefinitely.",0.0,0.0557127371430397,0,1

9,1g0p5os,AITA for not letting my husband go on ANOTHER vacation with his friend?,"We've always kept our $ separate and split bills evenly. We made roughly the same $ so it wasn't an issue. We had our first child 1.5y ago. I was working p/t a lot of my preg and after my 12w leave b/c we couldn't find daycare. I also just started my own business but it's taking longer to get clients so I'm currently not even making enough $ to cover ""my half"" of the bills. I started working 16h shifts on w/ends to make more $ but it's not enough. I do all of the cooking, cleaning, and most things for our son. I'm still nursing him. My hub has never given him a bath. I have done EVERY SINGLE night waking (he still wakes 1-2 /night). My hub works mostly f/t but does whatever he wants when he comes home and on the w/ends.

We've traveled a lot together. B4 we started TTC, we talked about how we will have to put travel on hold for a bit. He agreed and was fine with it. That turned into having 1 more trip before TTC so we went to Greece. Once preg it was 1 more trip b4 he's born so we went to Iceland. Then he planned another trip with his friend to Spain w/out me knowing and told me about 2w before he left. I was 28w preg and very upset. Then he tried going to Mexico with his BIL 2w b/4 my due date and I talked him out of it. Then we went on a trip to MA when our son was 3m and then to CO when he was 10m. Then he went to Mexico with his BIL a few m ago which he told me about days before he left. I just found out he is planning another trip with his friend to Albania w/o me knowing AGAIN. I finally put my foot down. We are a family and just b/c our $ is separate, we are in this together and can't afford it. Just b/c I am not making as much $ doesn't mean I am doing less or are less valuable. Ppl don't leave the country with their friend while their wife stays home to take care of the baby alone. Sometimes we need to sacrifice our wants. It's just temporary. He was BEGGING me to let him go and I said I really am not ok with it and I'm sorry but I think you're being selfish. He said he deserves a vacation. I kept firm and told him I am not ok with it. Since then (1w) he hasn't spoken to me. He sent me this text:

*""I feel like I had my soul sucked out. I'm not trying to be dramatic but I would do anything just to take a few days to travel. It's my biggest passion what I get excited for.

10,1g0ohzv,AITA for cursing out my Aunt?,"I (32M) grew up in a very conservative Christian family. I left the church when I was 28 simply because I realized that while I had respect for Christianity as a religion, it was not something that I personally believed in. On top of that I came out as bisexual and I‚Äôve seen how a lot of people in the LGBTQ community are treated by a lot of people in the church.

my aunt Gia (60F) has always had reputation in the family as a gossip, and also is notorious for her mean spirited behavior. On top of that she is what I call a super Christian and believes in forcing her religion down everybody‚Äôs throats. As you can probably guess my aunt is extremely homophobic and as a result, I never told her about my sexuality simply because I did not want the drama.

Somehow last year she found out and according to the rest of my family members, she had a meltdown. And ever since then she has been posting a lot of homophobic rhetoric on Facebook.

Now, normally I would not say anything to her about it because I have been conditioned from birth to be a complete pushover, but I‚Äôm not going to lie, It started to bother me because it started feeling like a personal attack. Needless to say our relationship is not good for the past year because I cannot see myself being close to somebody who has these negative opinions about me.

Yesterday, I was at work when I went on Facebook and saw that she once again posted homophobic rhetoric. So I decided that she was comfortable posting such hatefulness on the Internet. I would then intern let her know how I feel about it publicly. So I decided to comment under her post and this is what I said:

 ‚ÄúEvery time you post shit like this it reminds me why I left Christianity.. it‚Äôs one thing to have your own beliefs and opinions but it‚Äôs another thing to to attack a community because the believe differently than you.. this is not the first time you have posted stuff like this ..every time you post shit like this make me NOT want to call you my family because I refuse to associate with individuals who are this hateful.. doesn‚Äôt  1 John 4:8  say that God is love? How could a loving god breed such hatefulness? Sad‚Ä¶ but I mean I guess it‚Äôs true what they say ‚Äú there‚Äôs no hate like a Christian love‚Äú

A couple hours later I started getting phone calls from my family members asking if I was OK because apparently my aunt is now upset claiming that I ‚Äúcursed her out on Facebook‚Äù. On top of that, she‚Äôs refusing to now come to our families Thanksgiving celebration if I‚Äôm there

If I‚Äôm being completely honest, I don‚Äôt think I said anything in that comment that was rude. At the most I used two  curse words, but neither of them were directed at her specifically but more at the things that she was posting.

Most of my family is on my side and state that while I probably should‚Äôve not used profanity, I was completely right with what I said, but some of my friends think that I went too far because she‚Äôs family.

Been together 6 years, finally moving in together after finishing school. He's 30 and I'm 28. He makes 85k and I make 58k. He contributes 25% to his 401k and has savings on top of that (almost 60k) and is agreeing to drop it to 12% when we move in together. Rent is 2200 in Socal. I contribute 6% to my 401k and have 18k in savings. Originally he said he would cover rent and I could cover groceries and utilities since I have a car payment ($500) and student loans (4k). Now he says he doesn't think he should cover all the rent since he won't be able to save. Not 50/50 but he thinks it should be more proportional. 

I'm of the thought that he wants to save more at the expense of my savings and my 401k. If I have to pay some rent, I won't be able to save as much either when I already have significantly less in savings than he does. He's shown me the trajectory of his 401K which is set to have him be a millionaire at 40 and I can't help but think that when we move in I'll be struggling to save while he's on track to be a millionaire. 

My compromise was this: I'll pay some rent up until we get married in 2026 BUT after that he's paying the rent. Our savings would be joint at that point anyway. He seemed fine with this but the more I think about it, the less I'm willing to sacrifice a year of saving for him to pad his savings and 401k.

14,1g0lzs0,AITA for not getting special treats for a neighbor kid who has a disability? ,"Every year at Halloween we give out chips instead of candy.  My wife and I think it‚Äôs fun for the kids to get chips to go along with their candy.  We buy ahead of time at Costco so there‚Äôs always plenty.  What we don‚Äôt use will be saved for things like bbq later in the year so people can have their own bags of chips.  

I have a neighbor Debbie who is really upset about the potato chips we give put because her kid don‚Äôt eat them.  She thinks we should offer some other options to her kid because he has a disability.  I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair and I told her it‚Äôs extremely rude to ask people who are giving out free stuff for Halloween to change things for just one kid and I told her I‚Äôm not doing it.  When her child comes and knocks on my door he gets chips like everyone else.  I let the kids pick the types of chips from the bowl that they like and I feel like that‚Äôs more than generous.

15,1g0llj3,AITA for ‚Äúletting‚Äù my ex and my kids‚Äô half siblings ‚Äúbe poor‚Äù when I could help?,"
I have an ex with whom I share two kids (13M & 12M). Our relationship did not work out and we broke up seven years ago. Since I was the financially stable one, she wanted me to have full custody. I have had full custody ever since. She has visitation, but she only uses it intermittently. Quickly after the breakup, she started dating a guy ‚Äúwith money.‚Äù He is from overseas. She quickly got pregnant by the guy and they had a son. The guy did not want to ‚Äúraise someone else‚Äôs kids,‚Äù so she moved three hours away and completely stopped seeing our kids for almost two years. It turns out the guys‚Äô money was actually family money, and when his conservative family found out about my ex and the baby, they cut them off. Also, their son had some developmental issues. She got pregnant again and a few months later, her BF left and returned to his home country. She is now 6-ish months pregnant with no job and taking care of a special needs kid.

She called me last week and asked me for financial help. They are living out of a motel and she is running out of money. I have a lake house about 30 minutes from her. She asked if she could stay there. I said ‚Äúno.‚Äù She asked if I would send her money, I said, ‚Äúno.‚Äù She called me an AH. She said that I am letting ‚Äúmy family‚Äù suffer unnecessarily when I have the means to help. I told I have no obligation to help. We have been arguing ever since.

16,1g0l58v,"AITA for asking the host of our band practice to turn down/off (or change genre) the blasting electronica music he is playing during setup time for our classic rock/blues band?
","TLDR: Band member who hosts band practice blasting drum and bass, stressing me out, and refused to turn it down/change to different music. AITAH for asking him to change it, and saying he was being inconsiderate after he refused? 



The guitarist of my band, who hosts our practices in his home studio, has gotten in the habit of loudly playing electronic music (drum and bass) as we are arriving and setting up. It's so loud i have to put in my 'in ear monitors' as my seat is near a speaker. Often it's too loud to carry on a normal volume conversation without borderline yelling. I should note, we play classic rock/blues and a bit of reggae/jazz/etc. This music is a huge departure from what we are there to play. 

Knowing the guitarist, I have tolerated this in the past, as I predicted he would not have a conciliatory reaction to me politely asking him to turn it down and or put on different music. However, last practice I had had a stressful day and was REALLY not in the mood to be bombarded by loud electronic music. I said something along the lines of: ""hey i had a stressful day and this music is really adding to my stress and not putting me in the mood to play music. Do you mind turning it down and maybe putting on some rock/blues or something closer to the type of music we play here as a band."" 



His response was basically ""No. I just got home and i want to listen to this."" From there things escalated rather quickly (as they often do with him), he said if the roles were reversed he wouldn't complain and would just listen to whatever music i put on no matter how much he disliked it. I said he was being selfish and inconsiderate and a bad host. He accused me of telling him ""what he can and can't listen to in his own house."" I told him he was being a bully, he responded that I'm the bully for trying to control what music he can listen to. He also accused me of ""sabotaging band practice by making an issue out of this."" 



IMO its not as simple as its ""his house"", its not like I'm telling him what he's allowed to listen to when I'm not there. Band practice is a shared activity in a shared space, that happens to be at his house because its the best location; though it could be done at another house certainly. One primary reason he hosts, is due to his allergies to other band members pets. 

I believe I'm entitled to feel comfortable and respected in a shared space. Furthermore, when hosting people in your home, you try to make your guests feel comfortable and respect their wishes if they are within reason. For example, I keep the heat quite low in my house in winter, but if a guest is cold i will happily turn it up to make them feel comfortable; in fact I do so preemptively so they don't feel they have to impose by asking.

When he said ""No, I want to listen to this"" AITA for pointing out he was being inconsiderate and not just dropping the matter entirely?

I am feeling stuck and awful and am not sure how to handle this. In September my friends reached out (who live two hours away from me) to invite my husband (m34) and I (f36) out to a Halloween activity three hours away or so from where we live that is ticketed. I conferred with my husband and we decided to go as it sounded fun and at the time it seemed doable. However, we're running into issues. I work away from home so I am gone during the week, only seeing my husband on weekends so we are already stressed out (for context) with trying to do what we can to manage coordinating just daily life stuff while apart and right now, circumstances are that is not going to change. We also have a diabetic cat and we have no one available now to care for her. So, now, the options are: to not go (which will hurt and disappoint our friends--there is a lot of context here too. We often have to go to them, one has had a really hard time that I have not had enough time to spend with them but it has been overwhelming and I am doing the best I can, etc), or I go and my husband stays back (I do not want to do this because I do not want to drive the three hours there and back in one day, especially late at night, or spend time trying to figure out where to stay and miss out on time seeing my husband, My car is not exactly in the best shape either).  
The event is this weekend and I know I should have never said yes in the first place but now I am dreading it and just feel overwhelmed with trying to coordinate. I can't deny there is some other stuff seeping in (some resentment that we always have to go their way, they have only been to our house once because basically we said that it needed to be fair, and my own life circumstance stress ) impacting my judgement. I truly do not want to be a flakey friend and disappoint my friends, but I just do not know what else to do besides not go at this point.

Would I be the asshole and risk hurting and disappointing my friends by cancelling plans with them that I committed to in September?

Now, my son, being the rule-follower and total team player that he is (plus, he can eat like no one else), didn‚Äôt question it and just went for it. The problem is, I had no idea this was happening, and it wasn‚Äôt until recently that I realized just how extreme the coach‚Äôs advice actually was.

Apparently, the coach gave him a whole list of ‚Äúrules‚Äù to follow to pack on the weight quickly.

Now it makes sense why boxes of Boost started showing up on our doorstep out of nowhere! And to top it all off, the coach told him to cut back on cardio‚Äîincluding swimming, which is something he‚Äôs always loved.

21,1g0jtyh,AITA for telling my friend to stop mentioning pictures my wife posts? ,"I‚Äôve got a friend who the last couple of years has turned a bit ‚ÄúTatey‚Äù. He has been wronged by a couple of women in the past couple of years (one left him and got married within three months, the other stole a lot of his money) but he seems to have a particular dislike for women selling content or just generally being confident in how they look. 

That point brings me on to my wife. She‚Äôs 39 and we‚Äôve been together since school. She‚Äôs a very fit and attractive woman and her main hobby is pole dancing. She loves it and has been doing it for a few years. She‚Äôs really good and she loves it so much, it‚Äôs great to see her really excelling at something and being so passionate about it. She posts a lot of pictures and video of herself pole dancing on accounts that only friends can follow so it‚Äôs not like she does this for attention even though I‚Äôve told her if she ever wanted to I wouldn‚Äôt mind as a few of her friends have quite big followings and sometimes when they do shows my wife is in the photos and videos and gets a lot of positive comments. 

At the weekend I went to my friends to help him with some DIY and he asked me if I mind my wife posting what she posts. I said not at all it doesn‚Äôt bother me. He then said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre part of the problem.

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for telling my friend to stop mentioning pictures my wife posts?  I‚Äôve got a friend who the last couple of years has turned a bit ‚ÄúTatey‚Äù. He has been wronged by a couple of women in the past couple of years (one left him and got married within three months, the other stole a lot of his money) but he seems to have a particular dislike for women selling content or just generally being confident in how they look. 

That point brings me on to my wife. She‚Äôs 39 and we‚Äôve been together since school. She‚Äôs a very fit and attractive woman and her main hobby is pole dancing. She loves it and has been doing it for a few years. She‚Äôs really good and she loves it so much, it‚Äôs great to see her really excelling at something and being so passionate about it. She posts a lot of pictures and video of herself pole dancing on accounts that only friends can follow so it‚Äôs not like she does this for attention even though I‚Äôve told her if she ever wanted to I wouldn‚Äôt mind as a few of her friends have quite big followings and sometimes when they do shows my wife is in the photos and videos and gets a lot of positive comments. 

At the weekend I went to my friends to help him with some DIY and he asked me if I mind my wife posting what she posts. I said not at all it doesn‚Äôt bother me. He then said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre part of the problem. Women are getting too much ego and it‚Äôs bad enough when it‚Äôs single women but married women shouldn‚Äôt be doing that‚Äù I told him if he‚Äôs that bothered then don‚Äôt look and unfollow her.

22,1g0jthe,AITA for calling out a trainer who keeps sneaking up at me/us at the gym?,"
Some background: been boxing for 6-8 months and have experience in grappling at a reputable MMA gym. A trainer at this regular gym I go to has previously approached me with unsolicited critique but when asked couldn‚Äôt provide any direct feedback on what I was doing wrong, which I found annoying but handled politely the first time around. He offered to ‚Äútrain‚Äù me which I said I‚Äôd consider and let him know.

Today, I saw a beginner who looked like he had no prior training, so I kindly asked if he wanted some unsolicited advice in between his sets and when he was facing me. He was very receptive, even giving me fist bumps.

The same trainer then decided to interrupt us from behind, commenting on how I said I‚Äôm not an expert. (Iirc I told the beginner ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not exactly an expert but I‚Äôve been training for about 7 months now, can i show you how to and when to jab?) When i calmly but firmly pointed out that he wasn‚Äôt part of our conversation and explained that his interruptions come off as condescending. He acted surprised and claimed I was being hostile, and asked how he was offensive. After explaining that this wasn‚Äôt my first interaction with him, I also let him know what he said and asked how he would interpret that if the roles were reversed.

He didn‚Äôt seem to have an answer for that 
Or anything else after I walked him through the facts and he decided to end the conversation neutrally after explaining how his words could come across (ie saying that he can tell I‚Äôm not an ‚Äúexpert‚Äù as his opener to us? ) but now I‚Äôm questioning if I overreacted. 

 At the end, the beginner I approached asked if the training of his was free, and I heard him slightly scoff at that statement lol.

A lady in her 50s-60s cut the queue just right behind me. It was the moment where people started walking so no one bothered saying anything.

I settled into my seat next the the aisle (row C), minding my own business with my earphones in but slowly realised that the aisle traffic congested hard so I looked up.

Turns out that lady just stood there like a statue, frozr and blocked the way of the passengers behind her.

I could tell because she didn't want to lift her stuff by herself. She wasn't big, but wasn't small either.

I was about to pack my earphones away so I could help (I'm a Thai Aussie so like I'm double friendly). She saw me moving so she turned to me and do that finger clicking thing in my face to get my attention and said ""You help?"". I work hospitality and I fucking hate that shit.

But it was that moment of confusion, if you know what I mean, like I was gonna help anyway so might as well just help her, so people get to move on.

But shit I had the worst flight. She interrupts my movie so I could open her water bottle. She interrupts my game to unpack her snack. I was sleeping and she literally turned on the light on purpose to wake me up for some stupid shit that I had now started to ignore.

Also whatever I did for her she never said thank you or smile, none.

The plane landed and she did the same shit to me again but now demanding me retrieving the luggage for her. I declined in the most polite way possible : ""I think you should ask the staff to assist you""

He‚Äôs decided to have a really small wedding just a handful of close friends and family and he‚Äôs not inviting my husband (30M).

To give you some background, my brother has never really liked my husband and they‚Äôve had their fair share of disagreements over the years. I always thought that regardless of their differences, family should come together for important moments like this. When I expressed my disappointment about my husband not being invited, my brother told me it‚Äôs his wedding and he wants it to be intimate with people he feels comfortable around.

I felt pretty strongly about it and told him that I wouldn‚Äôt be attending if my husband wasn‚Äôt invited. For me, it‚Äôs a package deal. My husband and I are a team and it just feels unfair to make me choose between supporting my brother and supporting my husband. Now my brother is upset and thinks I‚Äôm being dramatic, saying I‚Äôm putting him in a tough position.

To complicate things, some family members have jumped in, saying I‚Äôm being unreasonable and that my brother deserves to have the wedding he wants without feeling guilty about inviting someone he doesn‚Äôt want there. I believe in family loyalty, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm overreacting by saying I won‚Äôt go.


Edit: I‚Äôm sorry I was so vague in my post, to answer some questions yes everyone else‚Äôs significant others were invited, no my husband is not homophobic (he‚Äôs lgbtq) and they don‚Äôt get along because my husband is into video games and comics and my brother sees that as childish and a waste of time, on top of that, my husband is pretty introverted and shy whereas my brother is extroverted so my brother sees him as a ‚Äúbuzzkill‚Äù.

I (29F) have a younger brother (26M) who is getting married soon, and while I‚Äôm excited for him and his husband (28m) there‚Äôs a pretty big issue. He‚Äôs decided to have a really small wedding just a handful of close friends and family and he‚Äôs not inviting my husband (30M).

To give you some background, my brother has never really liked my husband and they‚Äôve had their fair share of disagreements over the years. I always thought that regardless of their differences, family should come together for important moments like this. When I expressed my disappointment about my husband not being invited, my brother told me it‚Äôs his wedding and he wants it to be intimate with people he feels comfortable around.

I felt pretty strongly about it and told him that I wouldn‚Äôt be attending if my husband wasn‚Äôt invited. For me, it‚Äôs a package deal. My husband and I are a team and it just feels unfair to make me choose between supporting my brother and supporting my husband. Now my brother is upset and thinks I‚Äôm being dramatic, saying I‚Äôm putting him in a tough position.

To complicate things, some family members have jumped in, saying I‚Äôm being unreasonable and that my brother deserves to have the wedding he wants without feeling guilty about inviting someone he doesn‚Äôt want there. I believe in family loyalty, but I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm overreacting by saying I won‚Äôt go.

30,1g0gzrs,AITA for hiding things from my dad,"am I an ass hole?,

I 22 (f) living with my aunt and her family I grew up in her custody ever since I was an Infant but she treated me as her own, I'm with her even before she got married to this guy that I now call dad. that's when my life turned upside down I have learned that my now dad had 2 other daughters from different women and the way he treated them is always about for his benefits I had always been afraid that he would do the same to me. sure enough he did. I'm now studying 3rd year college attempting to follow my mom's footsteps in education and everything his mouth goes on about is the money that I would earn and the money that I would give him when I started earning.
he would always tell me to always focus on my studies, never go near any boys even my male friends are afraid of him even with my gay friends he would always get suspicious of me being in a relationship with them he told me that he doesn't want my attention steering away from him and our family. I met this guy during my first year in college we began dating everything is going well I am open about my relationship with my mom and she supports me we both know that dad wouldn't like it and would lash out if he finds out about it. he is the type to break stuff and bring in innocent people into the issue. so me and my mom hid it from him. he would get suspicious occasionally that I'm spending time with a guy because I would get home late and even if it's about school he would not believe me but my mom would always back me up. it always put a pressure on my mental health Having his eyes all over me he even got the school guard to look after me but thankfully that guard had been fired for other matters. I would always feel like he's everywhere watching me, he is basically the reason why I have severe anxiety. I can't go to parties I can't visit a friend, I always feel like I'm not living my own life. he even invaded my privacy before by looking through my phone I even found him taking pictures of my conversations with friends behind my back.

his excuse for Having his eyes on me all the time is because he never lived with the other 2 daughter he had from his previous wives and he wanted to fulfil the feeling of raising a child but he never contributed to my education. he also doesn't have a job and always rely on my mom's money as well as his siblings who lives in the US.

his excuse for forbidding me to not have a boyfriend is because he said I might get pregnant Early. that's what he always says he makes me feel like a slut a girl who all want is sex and he said that all guys are the same so he knows what they wanted and he was only trying to protect me. I feel unsafe and afraid of him he had always been the reason of my mental breakdowns making me think that I'm unlovable and my life is not worth living if I disobeyed him, he is also the type who would laugh at my flaws.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for hiding things from my dad am I an ass hole?,

36,1g0ffex,AITA for calling my stepmom selfish during family therapy?,"I'm (17f) in family therapy with my dad and stepmom. My dad wanted us to talk through our problems because my stepmom has been really upset lately that I have shut her out of my life in a pretty big way and she just wants to be closer. My mom died when I was 5 and I have two older brothers who are 20 and 23. My stepmom moved in when I was 8 and she and my dad got married when I was almost 11. We always got along okay. But I never thought of her as like a second mom or as the strongest mom figure in my life. 

My mom left videos for each of us. My dad got some birthday ones and a Christmas and wedding anniversary video. My brothers and I got every birthday until 18 that she'd miss, milestone birthdays, Christmas and big events like our own weddings and babies. After dad remarried I started to watch mine more at Christmas and I'd maybe watch my birthday videos twice. My dad remarrying made me think of mom more and made me miss her more. It felt more real that life had moved on without her and dad really fell in love with someone else. My dad watched his whenever his birthday or Christmas would happen too. But a year after he remarried he turned 40 and she started making faces whenever one of us would watch a mom video. And whenever dad would smile watching the video she would look annoyed/pissed. After that she suggested she could keep mine safe for me because I was so young but I didn't trust her to do that.

After three years of noticing this stuff, she told dad the videos made her unhappy and uncomfortable and she felt like an outsider at Christmas when he looked so in love with my mom. She also said she felt like the videos were a road block between her and us (me and my brothers). Dad compromised that he would watch his less and she wouldn't say anything to us. I saw my dad struggle with that for years. I saw him go to watch one of mom's videos and stop himself. Then my stepmom and I started fighting because I didn't want her to touch the disks the messages were recorded on. She was also upset when my brothers did backups of all the disks so we'd always have the messages even if the originals were broken. She told us we valued those more than we valued most people. Dad told her to leave us alone. But I stopped being as friendly with her as I was and shut her out. I left her out of prom stuff last year that she wanted to do with me and I always say no to hanging out with her.

This brought us to therapy and last week I spoke my mind and said I think she's incredibly selfish for making dad feel bad about watching the videos mom left for him. I said mom was his first wife, the mother of his children and if she really loved him she'd want him to have them. But she doesn't like knowing she came second and yet she joined the family anyway.

My dad wanted us to talk through our problems because my stepmom has been really upset lately that I have shut her out of my life in a pretty big way and she just wants to be closer. My mom died when I was 5 and I have two older brothers who are 20 and 23. My stepmom moved in when I was 8 and she and my dad got married when I was almost 11. We always got along okay. But I never thought of her as like a second mom or as the strongest mom figure in my life. 

My mom left videos for each of us. My dad got some birthday ones and a Christmas and wedding anniversary video. My brothers and I got every birthday until 18 that she'd miss, milestone birthdays, Christmas and big events like our own weddings and babies. After dad remarried I started to watch mine more at Christmas and I'd maybe watch my birthday videos twice. My dad remarrying made me think of mom more and made me miss her more. It felt more real that life had moved on without her and dad really fell in love with someone else. My dad watched his whenever his birthday or Christmas would happen too. But a year after he remarried he turned 40 and she started making faces whenever one of us would watch a mom video. And whenever dad would smile watching the video she would look annoyed/pissed. After that she suggested she could keep mine safe for me because I was so young but I didn't trust her to do that.

After three years of noticing this stuff, she told dad the videos made her unhappy and uncomfortable and she felt like an outsider at Christmas when he looked so in love with my mom. She also said she felt like the videos were a road block between her and us (me and my brothers). Dad compromised that he would watch his less and she wouldn't say anything to us. I saw my dad struggle with that for years. I saw him go to watch one of mom's videos and stop himself. Then my stepmom and I started fighting because I didn't want her to touch the disks the messages were recorded on. She was also upset when my brothers did backups of all the disks so we'd always have the messages even if the originals were broken. She told us we valued those more than we valued most people. Dad told her to leave us alone. But I stopped being as friendly with her as I was and shut her out. I left her out of prom stuff last year that she wanted to do with me and I always say no to hanging out with her.

This brought us to therapy and last week I spoke my mind and said I think she's incredibly selfish for making dad feel bad about watching the videos mom left for him. I said mom was his first wife, the mother of his children and if she really loved him she'd want him to have them. But she doesn't like knowing she came second and yet she joined the family anyway. I also mentioned why I never trusted her with mine. She was so upset because she had no idea I had picked up on and heard so much. She cried and said I didn't need to destroy her feelings like that.

37,1g0f84t,AITA for refusing to buy a new dress for any of my friend‚Äôs weddings?,"I (19f) have been attending a lot of weddings recently. (Most of my friends are my co-workers - who are much older to me).

I wasn‚Äôt included in the wedding but was invited so I always had a set dress. I wore a regular length ~tight black dress.

Now I should add for context I have attended 5 weddings over the last two years and none of them had a specific dress code.

One of my coworkers is getting married next June and after I received the invite she asked what I‚Äôd be wearing and I told her that I would wear my regular black dress (I don‚Äôt have a lot of others - the only ones I do are very formal). 

She told me after that she actually has imposed a dress code (which was not mentioned on the invite) and that everyone should be wearing red as she was going to wear black.

I agreed and said I‚Äôd get to buying a nice one. However, when I spoke to my other coworkers none of them mentioned anything about a dress code - one of them even asked her (the bride - ‚ÄúMaria‚Äù) and Maria said there was no dress code. 

Initially I thought this was confusing, and maybe she changed her mind and forgot to tell me, so when I asked my coworker to ask her, Maria said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like the black dress she always wears, it‚Äôs old and unflattering and I would rather my guests look presentable at my wedding.‚Äù

I always felt good in the dress, it is old (I bought it for my sophomore prom) but I felt as if it still worked. 

I texted Maria that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to attend her wedding. She came up to me at work and put a sweet act on about how she thought we were friends and she really wanted me there.

Eventually I told her I was not planning on buying a new dress because I heard what she said about my black one. Maria said I was mistaken but I know I was not.

Even though she apologised, she texted me later that I am uninvited from her wedding as she would rather not have a broke teenager ruining all her photos.

I spoke to my friend about this, and he thinks I could have just bought a cheap red dress and avoided all the drama.

Recently, MIL has been frustrating us. I used to do all the cleaning and cooking when I worked part-time, but since starting my second job, I don‚Äôt have the time or energy.

Despite this, she recently cooked food I had set aside to take to my parents, despite me telling her not to touch it. When my partner spoke to her, she shouted, claiming she didn‚Äôt know, though I had informed her.

The next morning, after our discussion about not touching my things, she over-watered my plant, which didn‚Äôt need watering. She laughed and said, ‚ÄúOh, it will probably die now,‚Äù which really upset me.

42,1g0drda,WIBTAH if I purposely blow up my FIL‚Äôs life? ,"This is still very fresh, so I apologize if the writing is scrambled. 

My Husband and I just found out that in the past two months his father has stolen in total about $800 from his banking account, $400 of which was between September 28th- October 8th. He had been pulling the money out the day he got paid so we didn‚Äôt realize(before anyone asks how he had access, they opened up the account together when he was 14 and he didn‚Äôt expect his father to steal from him so he never made it a point to take his name off the account). October 8th he pulled out $200, and it was the first time we noticed, which is what caused me to look and find all the other transactions. He called his dad who made some bs response that he needed it for bills and would get it back into our account the next day(which didn‚Äôt happen). We hit a rough patch early September due to me being ordered on bed rest, we very quickly went from a two income household to a single income and we had to really scrape things together to make it work. 

We thought we were struggling, but it turned out my husbands father was just stealing from us. I can‚Äôt even imagine how vile of a human being you have to be in order to listen to your son and his 8 month pregnant wife talk about their financial struggles, all the while knowing you‚Äôre taking food from their mouths. I can‚Äôt even imagine the pain and anger my husband is dealing with right now. 

FIL and his wife got into a pretty massive argument last month because she had been sending him money for all the bills(she‚Äôs the breadwinner) and he had been going and spending it all on his ‚Äúcoin collection‚Äù, leaving their mortgage and electric bill unpaid. From the time that argument happened to current, he has taken about $600, so I can only assume that he‚Äôs doing it to save his face and marriage. 

There‚Äôs no way his wife has any idea about this, she has truly been a blessing to my husband and I throughout all of this, and she would rather starve herself than take money from her children(I had stayed with my in-laws a few weeks while we were moving and she refused to let me pay rent for the time I was there). She is already on her last leg with him. 

So, wibtah if we confront him with all the transactions in front of his wife? I want her to know exactly the kind of man she married. Part of me wonders if that‚Äôs too far, but the other part of me is honestly too angry to care. I just cannot believe a person could be so foul to his own flesh and blood. 

TLDR: my Husbands father had stolen about $800 from him in the past two months, and his wife has no idea. Wibtah if we confront him about it in front of his wife, even though it‚Äôll likely be the nail in their marriage‚Äôs coffin? 



UPDATE: 

We‚Äôve gotten a lot of very helpful responses and advice from you all, and I want to start off by thanking you guys for that. This has been a very tough situation for everyone involved, and sometimes getting 3rd party advice is the best way to go. We did take him off the account this morning, tomorrow morning we will be closing the account and opening a new one at a different bank per suggestions. 

I did take a redditors advice and before we had confronted him about everything I took MIL aside and explained what had happened, and as I guessed she had no idea. She was beyond angry and hurt. She has been sending him $750 a month to help with utilities, and he‚Äôs been spending it on god knows what. Their electricity shut off on the 8th, which is why he took the $200 from us. He then tried to excuse the other 6 transactions as an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, then kept on switching from it being an accident to him having an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù after nobody including his wife believed that any of them were accidents. 

His wife sent us the money he had taken out, which I don‚Äôt agree with. I don‚Äôt feel like it was her mistake to rectify, but I also understand she couldn‚Äôt consciously let us suffer because of him. I have no idea where they are going to go from here, but I now know this is not the first time he has done this, and he had taken out money from HER account 4 times before she lost it on him. In my personal opinion he has a serious problem, whether it be gambling or addiction, I do not think he would be spending over 1k a month on coins. But hopefully this situation can be a means of his wife finding out what has actually been going on, and her being able to take the proper steps to protect herself from his financial instability. 

We honestly have no idea where to go from here. The last thing I personally want is for MIL to be sucked into this more than she is, which makes distancing very difficult because no matter what she‚Äôs also going to take some of that downfall, even if it‚Äôs just supposed to be him. I am not sure where their relationship is after this though, she feels very betrayed. 

So that‚Äôs where we‚Äôre at. I want to thank everyone again for the amazing advice, and the validating responses. You‚Äôve all helped out a lot more than you realize. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"WIBTAH if I purposely blow up my FIL‚Äôs life?  This is still very fresh, so I apologize if the writing is scrambled. 

My Husband and I just found out that in the past two months his father has stolen in total about $800 from his banking account, $400 of which was between September 28th- October 8th. He had been pulling the money out the day he got paid so we didn‚Äôt realize(before anyone asks how he had access, they opened up the account together when he was 14 and he didn‚Äôt expect his father to steal from him so he never made it a point to take his name off the account). October 8th he pulled out $200, and it was the first time we noticed, which is what caused me to look and find all the other transactions. He called his dad who made some bs response that he needed it for bills and would get it back into our account the next day(which didn‚Äôt happen). We hit a rough patch early September due to me being ordered on bed rest, we very quickly went from a two income household to a single income and we had to really scrape things together to make it work. 

We thought we were struggling, but it turned out my husbands father was just stealing from us. I can‚Äôt even imagine how vile of a human being you have to be in order to listen to your son and his 8 month pregnant wife talk about their financial struggles, all the while knowing you‚Äôre taking food from their mouths. I can‚Äôt even imagine the pain and anger my husband is dealing with right now. 

FIL and his wife got into a pretty massive argument last month because she had been sending him money for all the bills(she‚Äôs the breadwinner) and he had been going and spending it all on his ‚Äúcoin collection‚Äù, leaving their mortgage and electric bill unpaid. From the time that argument happened to current, he has taken about $600, so I can only assume that he‚Äôs doing it to save his face and marriage. 

There‚Äôs no way his wife has any idea about this, she has truly been a blessing to my husband and I throughout all of this, and she would rather starve herself than take money from her children(I had stayed with my in-laws a few weeks while we were moving and she refused to let me pay rent for the time I was there). She is already on her last leg with him. 

So, wibtah if we confront him with all the transactions in front of his wife? I want her to know exactly the kind of man she married. Part of me wonders if that‚Äôs too far, but the other part of me is honestly too angry to care. I just cannot believe a person could be so foul to his own flesh and blood. 

TLDR: my Husbands father had stolen about $800 from him in the past two months, and his wife has no idea. Wibtah if we confront him about it in front of his wife, even though it‚Äôll likely be the nail in their marriage‚Äôs coffin? 



UPDATE: 

We‚Äôve gotten a lot of very helpful responses and advice from you all, and I want to start off by thanking you guys for that. This has been a very tough situation for everyone involved, and sometimes getting 3rd party advice is the best way to go. We did take him off the account this morning, tomorrow morning we will be closing the account and opening a new one at a different bank per suggestions. 

I did take a redditors advice and before we had confronted him about everything I took MIL aside and explained what had happened, and as I guessed she had no idea. She was beyond angry and hurt. She has been sending him $750 a month to help with utilities, and he‚Äôs been spending it on god knows what. Their electricity shut off on the 8th, which is why he took the $200 from us. He then tried to excuse the other 6 transactions as an ‚Äúaccident‚Äù, then kept on switching from it being an accident to him having an ‚Äúemergency‚Äù after nobody including his wife believed that any of them were accidents. 

His wife sent us the money he had taken out, which I don‚Äôt agree with. I don‚Äôt feel like it was her mistake to rectify, but I also understand she couldn‚Äôt consciously let us suffer because of him.

45,1g0d7ao,AITA for calling the cops on my (maybe?) neighbors? ,"So I (20F) live in a house that was broken up into apartments. Attic is two apartments, ground floor is two, and tha basement is one. 

I live one of the attic apartments. The way it was modified was around the side of the house there is a door, when you open that door there's a rather steep and narrow stair case straight up to the two attic apartments. So the only possible neighbor I risk running into on the inside of the building would be that second attic apartment. 

When I first moved in 8 months ago the person across the hall was just at the tail end of the eviction process and left all of his stuff and his cat. So someone took the cat and the whole apartment had to be gutted because that place was one step away from being a biohazard. 

So for as long as I've lived here, that apartment has been empty. 

Around 9pm I was chilling with my boyfriend when I thought I heard talking in the hallway, a thick stench of cigarettes wafting through the door. I threw on a shirt and peeked my head out the door to see a man and a woman messing with the door to the other apartment. 

I initially apologized and they just said they were trying to get into the apartment. It was locked and they didn't have a key. 

I closed the door and told my boyfriend about it and then called my landlord, because I never saw anyone go in and finish actually fix that apartment since I moved here. 

I asked if anyone was living there or moving in and she said absolutely not and to call the police. 

As I hung up with her my boyfriend and I heard the door of the other apartment pop open. 

I called the police to tell them there were people possibly trespassing ans explained the whole situation. 

As I say that the door slams and the bolted down the stairs and ran to a truck parked around the back. My boyfriend was able to get photos of the truck and we shared it with the police who tracked down the couple. 

The weird part was they said they were tenants and called the homeowner on the spot for them, a man (my landlord is a woman). 

So I called my landlord back confused, and she was just as confused as I was. She did co-own the property with a man, but it was agreed upon that she handled contracts, finances, and moving people in while he handled maintenance and up keep of the property. She also said that in the 20 years she's worked with him he's never gone behind her back to move tenants in. So she also talked to the cop and low and behold the people had the right name and person who co-owns the house, so he just hadn't told her.

Last year I said I wasn‚Äôt going to do anything but my favorite artist had a concert+meet & greet on my birthday and i took my friend A(22M) with me cause he liked her as well and i didn‚Äôt want to go alone. 

I guess he took that as me changing my mind for some reason? so this year he‚Äôs been asking me what i want to do and originally i said a house party but that‚Äôs not going to work so i elected to my og plan of nothing. apparently that‚Äôs not what he wanted to hear, so he‚Äôs been pestering me to change my mind by saying things like ‚Äúspending your birthday alone is CRAZYYY‚Äù or ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt really want to spend it by yourself‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äôd be a bad friend if i let you spend my birthday alone.‚Äù and usually when he does this i just ask him to drop it, but tonight he‚Äôd been annoying all night and i was fed up. 

i very firmly told him to stop asking me about my birthday and it‚Äôs pissing me off. i already told him nicely to stop asking several times prior. he immediately shut me down and called me rude and that i shouldn‚Äôt talk to him like a child because it‚Äôs disrespectful. that he was simply trying to be a good friend a push me towards a good time and i shouldn‚Äôt make him feel guilty for wanting to do that. 

i told him that i don‚Äôt want a party. i don‚Äôt want to be celebrated. i want to be ALONE. so him pushing me towards something i‚Äôve repeatedly told him i DONT WANT is obviously going to piss me off. we got into a whole fight where he basically guilt tripped me saying that if i don‚Äôt explain why i don‚Äôt want to have a party, my friends are going to be confused and will feel like bad friends if they don‚Äôt celebrate me.

Tuesday-was a little better. We went to this huge mall and had a fun family moment, and the pool had opened completely. Overall a good day. 
Wednesday-was bumpy. Parents decided to choose a boat ride as our activity, (they‚Äôre completely aware of my fear of boats and was told I HAD to attend.) My mom finally canceled it because it was all booked up, so we decided to do the aquarium instead.
We stopped for a minute to look around at some shops, and I asked if we could go back later. My stepdad said yes so we continued to the aquarium.
Only for him to end up saying no after the aquarium. For the reason ‚Äúwe had to be back for our reservations‚Äù (weren‚Äôt until 8:20, it was 4:30 and bus ride takes 15 minutes) so for the bus ride I gave them the silent treatment.
(Parents have a habit of making/saying yes to plans, canceling last minute, and calling me spoiled for being upset) 

Fast forward to dinner, I managed to calm down so I could enjoy the little time we had together. Afterwards I tried to play pool w/ them in the lobby. I asked for the to watch to table while I went pee. But when I got back the table was occupied by another group while my family  was across the room drinking and gave little to no explanation and instead said they‚Äôd wait only 10 minutes for it to open along with telling me to stop whining about a dumb pool table. For whatever reason that was my breaking point and I‚Äôd stormed off to the room.

Only for him to end up saying no after the aquarium. For the reason ‚Äúwe had to be back for our reservations‚Äù (weren‚Äôt until 8:20, it was 4:30 and bus ride takes 15 minutes) so for the bus ride I gave them the silent treatment.
(Parents have a habit of making/saying yes to plans, canceling last minute, and calling me spoiled for being upset) 

Fast forward to dinner, I managed to calm down so I could enjoy the little time we had together. Afterwards I tried to play pool w/ them in the lobby. I asked for the to watch to table while I went pee. But when I got back the table was occupied by another group while my family  was across the room drinking and gave little to no explanation and instead said they‚Äôd wait only 10 minutes for it to open along with telling me to stop whining about a dumb pool table. For whatever reason that was my breaking point and I‚Äôd stormed off to the room. 

I've been on so many vacations with my family, and it‚Äôs never ended well. I've tried talking to my mom about it, but she either never listens or disregards everything I say. While it sounds dramatic, I‚Äôm not sure how much many more times I can take of consistent arguing when I‚Äôm also trying to have a good time. 

(I can see how I can come off as the cliche spoiled brat (which I won‚Äôt deny I am) but I‚Äôm not mad that I didn‚Äôt get to shop more or play pool. I was more upset that my parents pulled the same stunt again. I am VERY grateful for my parents and all they do but I just wish they‚Äôd keep their word)",1.0,0.1236403211951255,0,0

52,1g0bu2c,AITA for cancelling my friends trip?,"I‚Äôm part of a friend group of 8, and we planned a trip to Korea in December as a graduation celebration, especially since two of us will be enlisting to the army soon. We‚Äôve been looking forward to this as a once-in-a-lifetime trip together, so we want everything to be perfect.

We booked our air tickets around February, however as the months went by, tensions have been escalating with one friend in particular (let‚Äôs call him Ray). He constantly complains about money spent on the trip (air ticket and accommodation) which made everyone annoyed and frustrated at him. Even during our regular meetups for meals, he‚Äôd kick up a fuss over small things, like a discrepancy as small as $5 in the bill. This kind of behavior frustrated everyone.

What made things worse was when we discovered Ray had been badmouthing another member of the group to his other friends. One of our friends happened to hear what he‚Äôd been saying, and it became a major point of tension between us all.

At first, we tried to cut Ray some slack, thinking maybe he was going through something personal that he hadn‚Äôt shared with us. We gave him the benefit of the doubt and even tried asking him subtly if everything was okay. But Ray never opened up, and his behavior only worsened. Over the months, Ray became increasingly unpleasant, and our group grew hesitant about having him join us on the trip.

We knew we couldn‚Äôt ignore the issue any longer, so we decided to confront him and be honest about our feelings. We hoped he‚Äôd choose to cancel his flight on his own‚Äîafter all, why go on a trip with people who don‚Äôt want you there? During the conversation, we explained how his constant complaints and negative attitude had impacted the group, and how the tension between him and the other group member would make things uncomfortable for everyone.

Ray didn‚Äôt take it well at first. He insisted on coming and said we were overreacting, claiming that he didn‚Äôt mean anything serious by his complaints or the things he‚Äôd said. But we stood our ground, and eventually, we suggested that if he really wanted to come, he would have to book his own accommodation. We even offered to reimburse him for his flight and the accommodation he had already paid for if he canceled the trip.

After a week of back-and-forth, Ray finally decided to cancel his flight. Now, I‚Äôm wondering, AITA for forcing him into a corner and threatening him with the fact that he would have no place to stay?

I know we could‚Äôve addressed this sooner instead of letting his hopes build, but he was a decent friend before, and at the time, his behavior was more bearable. We wanted this trip to be perfect, and we felt his presence would ruin it, not just for us but for him as well, since he‚Äôd be isolated with no one to talk to.

They were at work so they couldn‚Äôt but asked if I wanted to hang out on later in the week, I said sure and waited till the day we agreed upon. No message, we talked back that day so it‚Äôs not like they forgot about me. But I check later and realize they are playing with a friend we both share and one of the people I don‚Äôt like. I was a bit surprised but I was like oh they are just playing a game with them and ask me later if I am still up to hang out. 

That did not happen, the next day came and went they didn‚Äôt message all day. Feeling a bit mad I reply to the hangout text and wait. They sent me a half-ass reply and about how their sleep schedule is messed up and how the show we are watching is almost over and said sorry at the end. I decided to call them out how they hanged out with other people last night and didn‚Äôt text me afterwards at all, also how their sleep schedule messed up is nothing to do with hanging out.

They started to message me, sending some memes or TikToks then deleting them, and said that they would give me space. They did all that in the span of a day. The next day, they message me again asking if we are still friends so they can stop obsessing over this.

Today he called and his sister started asking me random question, I was caught off guard because I didn‚Äôt know she was there and that I was on speaker, and then as I was saying something mid sentence she hung up on me? As a joke?? Not sure where the humour is but he called back and she was laughing in the background. After this, I told him not to call if I‚Äôm gonna be on speaker. He replied ‚Äúwhy is it such a big deal?‚Äù So I said because I don‚Äôt like it?

59,1g0aopz,AITA for bringing up my coworker's treatment of me to my boss?,"A little bit of context: 
I (21 NB) am DIAGNOSED with Adhd/ autism. Social cues and Social norms and whatnot are NOT my strongsuit.

I recently moved and I got a job as a Document Coordinator. It's a job that I had to relearn since I had a similar one years prior. The whole building has multiple departments but we have our own mini office. 

I got hired in an office with 4 other employee's (Fake names/ estimated ages) Korra (45F), Aussie (35F), and Sierra (28F) 
These people have worked at this company for quite some time with loads of things in common.

Since I have been working here, I have had 3 people UNPROMPTED come up to me while on mail walk and ask me something along the lines of, ""Why are they talking to you this way"", ""Don't you think their tone when they talk to you is kind of.. snooby?"" (Not my words- I'd personally say they sometimes have a more... annoyed tone?) 

Recently it's been getting alot worse.
I was accidentally sent a screenshot of my own text with the label ""wtf"" because Aussie and Sierra were texting each other ABOUT something I had asked. 
It was resolved the next day with the excuse that, ""Oh well I've been stressed and we were confused on your question."" Etc.. but like... I didn't quite honestly believe that. I grew up in a superficial town where you couldn't quite tell just anyone anything without gossip and whispers down the street. 

Aussie sometimes flat out ignores me in casual talk or work questions. An example from 2 days ago was when I was mid sentence with a work question that I know she was engaging with (I always get the attention of the other person before saying anything normally)
And mid sentence she cuts me off, turns towards Sierra and starts a new convo with her, not even answering the question I was asking. 

Aussie will hop into the conversation with the other two but if I have anything to say, she almost slows/ stops conversing.
When she does respond, sometimes it can come off as kind of rude in a way. (I'd like to add that this is just how I see it from MY OWN PERSPECTIVE because maybe I'm misinterpreting but Aussie has an entirely different tone talking to me vs talking to Korra or Sierra) 

Where I may be the AH is that I finally brought this up with my boss, Korra, today. 
I told her how this is effecting me and how it is kind of getting way too much. She said we can all have a chat together about it which I'm terrified will make it worse.
I feel like the AH because sometimes they can be nice. Sierra is alot nicer (to my face at least...) And will help out in office alot more than Aussie will.

I'm not saying ""Everyone should love me and think I'm cool at all times ever"" and I'm not saying I want/ expect ""Work besides forever bffs omg!!""

65,1g09ep7,AITA for telling my friend that I can‚Äôt tell when my tone offends him and for calling him verbally abusive?,"(Throwaway) Recently, my friend and I had a big argument, and it ended with him removing me from our DnD group and kicking me out of the group chat. It all started when I asked how he was doing since he had been ignoring me. He mentioned that he wasn‚Äôt doing well, which I said was understandable because of the stress we‚Äôve both been under. However, he then told me I was making everyone uncomfortable and acting ""uncool.""

I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt noticed any issues, so I asked for examples. He said it was my tone, and could only really give me one instance where this affected him. For context, I‚Äôm autistic, so controlling my tone can be difficult for me, but I‚Äôve asked people to let me know if something I say comes across as hurtful so I can fix it. It took 3 or 4 times of me repeating myself before he finally acknowledged that he would tell me when my tone was affecting him. When he did, I apologized and tried to explain myself. Instead of giving me specific feedback, he told me I just needed to ""be nicer."" 

I apologized multiple times, but I was also hurt that he had never told me about this issue before. The conversation escalated, and he called me an asshole, which made me more upset. Then, things got worse when he called me delusional. I didn‚Äôt get mad until he brought up my mother, saying my apology was ‚Äútextbook‚Äù for not taking responsibility. I mentioned that my mother says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings‚Äù all the time, and he responded with, ""Your mother has never been sorry in her life"" and later added after I told him that was hurtful, ""Well, your mom doesn‚Äôt know how to act.""

I was so overwhelmed that I ended the conversation, blocked him so I could cry myself to sleep, and went to bed. 

After the argument, I sent him an apology, taking responsibility for my tone and explaining that I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress lately. I said I didn‚Äôt want to escalate things, but I just wanted him to apologize for how hurtful his language was and acknowledge that the way he brought up the conversation wasn‚Äôt respectful. 

Later, one of my friends sent me a screenshot of what he said to the DnD group chat. In the message, he called me toxic and said I couldn‚Äôt recognize when I was wrong. He said I was adding to his stress and making the DnD sessions uncomfortable for others, so I wasn‚Äôt welcome anymore.

(Throwaway) Recently, my friend and I had a big argument, and it ended with him removing me from our DnD group and kicking me out of the group chat. It all started when I asked how he was doing since he had been ignoring me. He mentioned that he wasn‚Äôt doing well, which I said was understandable because of the stress we‚Äôve both been under. However, he then told me I was making everyone uncomfortable and acting ""uncool.""

I was confused because I hadn‚Äôt noticed any issues, so I asked for examples. He said it was my tone, and could only really give me one instance where this affected him. For context, I‚Äôm autistic, so controlling my tone can be difficult for me, but I‚Äôve asked people to let me know if something I say comes across as hurtful so I can fix it. It took 3 or 4 times of me repeating myself before he finally acknowledged that he would tell me when my tone was affecting him. When he did, I apologized and tried to explain myself. Instead of giving me specific feedback, he told me I just needed to ""be nicer."" 

I apologized multiple times, but I was also hurt that he had never told me about this issue before. The conversation escalated, and he called me an asshole, which made me more upset. Then, things got worse when he called me delusional. I didn‚Äôt get mad until he brought up my mother, saying my apology was ‚Äútextbook‚Äù for not taking responsibility. I mentioned that my mother says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I hurt your feelings‚Äù all the time, and he responded with, ""Your mother has never been sorry in her life"" and later added after I told him that was hurtful, ""Well, your mom doesn‚Äôt know how to act.""

I was so overwhelmed that I ended the conversation, blocked him so I could cry myself to sleep, and went to bed. 

After the argument, I sent him an apology, taking responsibility for my tone and explaining that I‚Äôve been under a lot of stress lately. I said I didn‚Äôt want to escalate things, but I just wanted him to apologize for how hurtful his language was and acknowledge that the way he brought up the conversation wasn‚Äôt respectful. 

Later, one of my friends sent me a screenshot of what he said to the DnD group chat. In the message, he called me toxic and said I couldn‚Äôt recognize when I was wrong. He said I was adding to his stress and making the DnD sessions uncomfortable for others, so I wasn‚Äôt welcome anymore. I‚Äôm also really hurt that he has cut me off from my DnD friends without giving me a chance to explain my side of the story.

67,1g08vz9,WIBTA If I don't pay for my stepfather's ticketa to visit me?,"AM I THE ASSHOLE NOT TO BUY TICKETS FOR MY STEPFATHER TO COME VISIT ME?

First I'd like to warn you guys that english isn't my first language, so it may be poorly written.

Well, let's start:

I'm (F28) brazilian, but I live in Japan with my husband (M26). My entire family still lives in Brazil, and they're not rich or anything, mostly middle class I think... Adding it for some context.

We came here to work and save money and I just found out I'm pregnant! I'm very very happy about it, as we always wanted to have a big family.

Now I'm saving some money so I can invite my mom (F51), my dad (M60) and my stepmom (F62) to come visit and help with the baby after labor. I pretend to pay for the 3 of them. However, after I told my mom I refused to pay for my stepfather's (M53) ticket, seh got really sad and said whe wasn't coming. She said she 'can't leave him alone for 2 months, he can't deal with everything alone' (mind you they live in a small house on the middle of nowhere, but he can drive and as an adult man should be able to take a little care of the house and the cat). 

You guys must be wondering why I will not pay for him, well... when I was a teenager he used to offend me, call me ugly, freak and dumb, forbidden me from having house keys (he said I'd lost it and then random people would follow me and enter the house) and I ended up locked outside many time, he said I (13 yo at the time) was makig strategies so and creating situations to separate him and my mom, said I was a burden and kicked me out 'his house' (which my mom helped paying for) and I had to go live with my grandma.

During this time my mom would only see me once a week and spent all her free days with him. I know she has her flaws and made choices, but she said sorry and we're trying to rebuild this relationship, also because I grew to see how abusive, narcissistic and selfish he is and how it affects her. He even brainwashed her into becoming an right-wingish Karen like person sometimes... (She used to be inteligent and smart, but he trapped her far from society now)

Now, coming back to present times. Me and my mom have been trying to bond again for the last few years and we can have good times together, and as I said, I'm polite around my stepfather.

On my way home from work, I decided to surprise her. I picked up a Krabby Patty burger, a chicken sandwich for myself, and two pineapple Frostys. I knew she was about an hour away, so I told her I had a surprise waiting for her when she got home.

To keep the food fresh, I put her burger in the fridge and the Frosty in the freezer. I even ordered the burger without lettuce, thinking I could avoid it getting soggy, and we have lettuce at home that we could add fresh.

When she got home, she was excited about the Frosty and asked, ""Is there a Krabby Patty burger too?"" I told her to check the fridge, and that‚Äôs when things went downhill. She got upset because the burger was cold and I didn‚Äôt get fries. She said that real ""justice"" would have been me waiting for her to come home so we could both get fresh food together, or at least putting my food in the fridge too, so we‚Äôd both be eating cold food.

She accused me of always expecting grand thanks for doing gestures that aren‚Äôt as big as I think they are and said I didn‚Äôt listen to her, since she wanted the full meal, not just the burger and Frosty. She also said she‚Äôs not going to pretend to be grateful for something that wasn‚Äôt what she asked for.

I was just trying to do something nice, and now I feel like my gesture was totally unappreciated. AITA?


Update: so we talked about it and I explained that I didn't have a problem if she would have said, I appreciate the gesture but I would have liked to get it together or if we would have waited until she was home.

 I told her I understood why she was upset and we both agreed that there was a better way to talk about it. 

She took a bite just now and said ""this is just a Dave's single with fancy sauce,"" so she doesn't even want it anymore hot or cold.

72,1g07mma,AITA for relocating without telling my parents and siblings and refusing to give my brother a house down payment?,"I (33f) am relocating out of my home state in 2 weeks. 

I went no contact with my parents and siblings nearly 4 years ago shortly after I purchased my current home. My parents are very blue collar and grew up with only brothers. My brother is the only boy, the baby, autistic, and named his only son after my brother who passed away. He gets everything. My sister is very masculine, blue collar, lesbian. I‚Äôm white collar, educated and very girly. 

My entire life I‚Äôve always been the outsider and they made sure I knew that, harshly. It was worse whenever I succeeded in life. No contact with them was the best thing I could‚Äôve ever done for my mental health and I‚Äôll never go back unless they‚Äôre all in intensive therapy. 

Fast forward to this week they found out I‚Äôm relocating out of state and selling my home. Naturally, the horrific texts have rolled through and are extra special. They know what I bought it for and a simple search they will know what I‚Äôm selling for. They‚Äôre ‚Äúhurt‚Äù I didn‚Äôt tell them and want the money they gifted me to get my home to give my brother. 

I refuse to give them any access to my life. They gifted my sister her down payment and me but unable to for my brother. Of course they think I‚Äôm an AH and a few more nice choice words. My cousin and uncle say I should give the money because it‚Äôs only 1/3 of my proceeds. I refuse. They gave MY savings account to him that I had been building for years. 

But, I‚Äôm second guessing my decision to not tell them where I‚Äôm going or giving them the money back. I‚Äôm still their daughter and they want to know my whereabouts. My brother has a 3 yr old son and 1 year old daughter. It‚Äôs expensive where we are and I want the kids to have stability. So, Am I TAH?

EDIT TO ANSWER COMMON QUESTIONS: I am no contact. I do not initiate or engage with them at all. I don‚Äôt have them blocked due to they will text me about important family updates like my uncle died, or was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs. (I have 11) Also for evidence if needed for an injunction of harassment or something else which has been the case in 2021. 

They found out through a family member who has early Alzheimer‚Äôs. I will not go no contact or scold someone with a horrible disease over this. 

The savings account was a conservator account from when my brother and I got a settlement as babies. We both needed to be 18 and a court order to withdraw but could add. I took advantage of it by adding birthday and chore money. My mom managed to get the court order for both when my brother turned 18, I was 19 and the bank gave her the funds. She gave it to my brother. I‚Äôve no idea why she did and can only guess.

My entire life I‚Äôve always been the outsider and they made sure I knew that, harshly. It was worse whenever I succeeded in life. No contact with them was the best thing I could‚Äôve ever done for my mental health and I‚Äôll never go back unless they‚Äôre all in intensive therapy. 

Fast forward to this week they found out I‚Äôm relocating out of state and selling my home. Naturally, the horrific texts have rolled through and are extra special. They know what I bought it for and a simple search they will know what I‚Äôm selling for. They‚Äôre ‚Äúhurt‚Äù I didn‚Äôt tell them and want the money they gifted me to get my home to give my brother. 

I refuse to give them any access to my life. They gifted my sister her down payment and me but unable to for my brother. Of course they think I‚Äôm an AH and a few more nice choice words. My cousin and uncle say I should give the money because it‚Äôs only 1/3 of my proceeds. I refuse. They gave MY savings account to him that I had been building for years. 

But, I‚Äôm second guessing my decision to not tell them where I‚Äôm going or giving them the money back. I‚Äôm still their daughter and they want to know my whereabouts. My brother has a 3 yr old son and 1 year old daughter. It‚Äôs expensive where we are and I want the kids to have stability. So, Am I TAH?

EDIT TO ANSWER COMMON QUESTIONS: I am no contact. I do not initiate or engage with them at all. I don‚Äôt have them blocked due to they will text me about important family updates like my uncle died, or was diagnosed with Alzheimer‚Äôs. (I have 11) Also for evidence if needed for an injunction of harassment or something else which has been the case in 2021. 

They found out through a family member who has early Alzheimer‚Äôs. I will not go no contact or scold someone with a horrible disease over this. 

The savings account was a conservator account from when my brother and I got a settlement as babies. We both needed to be 18 and a court order to withdraw but could add. I took advantage of it by adding birthday and chore money. My mom managed to get the court order for both when my brother turned 18, I was 19 and the bank gave her the funds. She gave it to my brother. I‚Äôve no idea why she did and can only guess. ",0.0,0.0411424785852432,0,1

I‚Äôve asked them to stop their two younger girls from walking on my gravel, why? One because I‚Äôm sick of having to relay it and set the back to look nice and two, because it‚Äôs simply impolite. It went ignored.

But life happened, we had two sons, Noel (20M) and Will (17M) young and those big dreams faded. Steven's stuck teaching English at the local comp, living on an estate. Now, I love Steven, but everyday, he comes home angrier, more frustrated and lately, he's been taking it all out on Will.

Will's always been his own person. Loud, cocky and arrogant. Dressed in nowt but adidas ane band tshirts, mouthing off about football or music, winding everyone up. He's not what Steven wanted him to be. Back when Will was a baby, Steven was obsessed with the idea that he'd be something special, but as Will's grown up into this unapologetic working-class lad, Steven can't handle it.

It was all going well until we got to the guest list. The guest list had pretty much been finalized at this point but it was my first time seeing it. I noticed that my name didn't have a plus one and that my wife's name wasn't on the list at all. I assumed that it must have been a mistake so I asked Anya about it casually in front of everyone.

I feel it is important to mention at this point that Anya and I are both South Asian and Anya's wedding is going to take place in India (although we live in the US) so that all her relatives and parents' friends are able to attend.

I told one of my colleagues, and she has proceeded to tell other colleagues of mine, without my knowledge, so some of them have come in and talked to me, without me being able to approach each situation. I'm upset, and very irate with my colleague for talking about my loss with people, I feel like it was up to me to speak to people, when I'm ready. 

I lost my temper with her, and she's guilted me that she did it so I didn't have to have ""the awkward"" conversation about a loss of a loved one with them. That she did it for my well-being, and such, and me being angry with her isn't fair.

87,1g0ve93,WIBTA for refusing to rehome my dog even though my roommates are complaining?,"I (22F) live with my boyfriend (23M) and another couple (both 22). We all moved in together at the same time, and the woman in the couple is a high school friend. They already had a cat, and after settling in, I decided to adopt a dog. I‚Äôve struggled with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and ADD, and I‚Äôve found that living with a dog helps. Plus, I‚Äôm planning to move abroad in a year and wanted a familiar companion.

Before getting the dog, I asked my roommates how they felt, and they were fine with it since they already had a cat, and their cat liked dogs. I adopted a mix-breed dog, and I‚Äôve worked hard to potty train him (no accidents for three months). I also invested in professional training, and he‚Äôs doing advanced obedience classes.

The main issue is my dog has separation anxiety. When we‚Äôre at work for 8 hours, he used to cry, bark, throw up, and even escape his crate. To help, I walked him in the mornings, did light training, and hired a dog walker. That became too expensive, so I started leaving him in my room with a chew toy. This reduced some behaviors, but my roommates still complained about his whining.

I eventually sent him to a $2,000 board-and-train program. Since returning, he no longer cries, whines, or escapes his crate, and he‚Äôs no longer destructive. However, he still barks once every 2-10 minutes for about four hours. I‚Äôve been working with the trainer, but my roommates don‚Äôt think the progress is enough. They‚Äôve asked me to rehome him, saying it‚Äôs unfair he‚Äôs crated for 8 hours and that the barking is disruptive.

My dog came from a shelter, and I‚Äôve done everything I can to give him a better life. He gets daily park visits, plenty of exercise, vet visits, etc. He comes on trips and hikes with me and socializes with my mom‚Äôs dog. He‚Äôs not perfect, but he‚Äôs made progress, and I don‚Äôt think rehoming is the answer.

I also feel entitled to keeping him due to other roommate issues. I‚Äôve spent over $1,100 on shared house items, and they‚Äôve never contributed or helped with chores. They clogged our shower drain, and my boyfriend paid for the plumber. The woman sometimes flirts with my boyfriend or tries to villainize me, which is uncomfortable. When they mention dog issues, they say, ‚ÄúYou need to take care of it,‚Äù even though I‚Äôm at work (its usually at 7am). When I mentioned contacting the trainer or rehoming, the woman immediately latched onto rehoming, offering to help find him a new home, which felt insensitive.

I‚Äôve been quiet about these frustrations because they‚Äôve been patient while my dog‚Äôs in training, but I feel like I deserve to keep him after everything I‚Äôve handled. I don‚Äôt think rehoming is the right solution.

88,1g0v93q,AITA for scolding my best friend after his dad threw out my gym equipment,"2 years ago I moved in w/ my gf and couldn't fit my gym equipment in my new apt (\~$1200 worth of gear - a bench, a squat-rack, 3 barbells and about 500 lbs of plates.) I asked my best friend (32 yo who lives at home w/ his parents) to hold on to it since he works out at home. He only had a bench and some dumbbells so i figured he could make good use of my equipment. The agreement was always that I would get it back when I moved to a new spot but that he could keep it in the meantime.... I never said the equipment was his and I've made references throughout the past two years about ""my weights"".

I recently moved and now have a backyard. I asked him for the equipment and he says his dad threw it away. I see this friend at least every other week but we text almost daily and he never mentioned that his dad would be throwing out my stuff. When I found out, I went off on him and I'm now very tempted to cut him out of my life. He lives a very carefree life (no bills no major responsibilities) so I can understand why he might not know the monetary value of the gym equipment. But this kinda thing happens often and I'm just a little fed up with the dgaf attitude and just how inconsiderate he was by not letting me know. I've already been questioning our friendship because I often feel like I'm outgrowing him. He's never intentionally done me dirty, but he lives in a very different world where and he's never needed to consider much outside his 4 walls. This one hurts though because I know the value of the weights and I can't ask him to buy me new equipment because 1) he can't afford it and 2) I doubt he'll even feel guilty/the need to.

I just think a heads up would have been nice so that I could have had a chance to put the gear in a storage unit or at least tried to sell it. But instead I had to ask about my stuff only to learn it's gone. 

AITA for scolding him and telling him I might need a break from this friendship? Should I not be expecting more from my best friend of 20 years?

89,1g0v09k,"AITA for not going with my friend to a ""party""","Hi, before we start I want to say I'm not very good at English,so sorry for the typos.

This happen  months ago , around July ,my (19 f) , friend let's name her May (also 19f)  asked me to come with her to a party. She said that our other friend (18F) will also come and that there will be many people. Also to mention, the guy who's is making this party is May's friend. May said that she'll call me to make sure if I'm able to come. I agreed to come . The party was to set at Saturday .

Then a few days later,
the Saturday came and I never got the call from her.I made plans with my boyfriend to have a sleepover over his and then she suddenly calls me. It was like 10 pm at the time. She asked what I was doing and I told her I was at my boyfriends and she asked if I can come with her to that party because she didn't want to be alone with her male friend who is hosting that party. I asked May what about the other people that were attending and she said that no one is coming expect her. 

I said no , because my boyfriend lives far away from where the party is ,and I know I'll be bored with just two people. She started begging me and said that I could leave whenever I want . I know that I'll get bored in few minutes and plus I won't be able to go back home if I went there. Then I was done with begging and pressuring and I told her big NO and she should've called me earlier about this. Then she just said okay and that was it.


I called the other friend that was supposed to come and she agrees with me about this situation. But I've tried to reach out May and she ignored me every time. So AITA?


[EDIT] As I'm reading what I wrote,I realized that I didn't give enough info about this situation ,so here it is. I'm going to write everything in bullet points:

- May didn't tell me the exact time when this party is going to happen even after I asked.

-  May didn't tell the other friend that was supposed to go as well ,let's call her Jenna , that no one else will be there.

- Jenna lives far away so if she came along,she would be in the same situation if I went . So that's why she agreed with me.

- About me rejecting the invite after she called the second time. I didn't want to go for several reasons,as I've mentioned if I got bored  or if I was uncomfortable I couldn't go home because of transportation. Second,May   has this weird flirty personality whenever she's hanging out with a guy and I didn't want to be a third wheel. 


- May didn't want to be alone with her guy friend because she said it's embarrassing ( not to be seen with him but like she is 'shy')  even tho she's leading him on and flirts with him .


- When I said , she's going to check if I'm still going is because she didn't really know if the party is going to happen on Saturday,so she said that she'll call me back before Saturday to tell me if the party is still happening,she never did.

So that's about it with this edit,if you have any more questions ask away!

I asked May what about the other people that were attending and she said that no one is coming expect her. 

I said no , because my boyfriend lives far away from where the party is ,and I know I'll be bored with just two people. She started begging me and said that I could leave whenever I want . I know that I'll get bored in few minutes and plus I won't be able to go back home if I went there. Then I was done with begging and pressuring and I told her big NO and she should've called me earlier about this. Then she just said okay and that was it.


I called the other friend that was supposed to come and she agrees with me about this situation. But I've tried to reach out May and she ignored me every time. So AITA?


[EDIT] As I'm reading what I wrote,I realized that I didn't give enough info about this situation ,so here it is. I'm going to write everything in bullet points:

- May didn't tell me the exact time when this party is going to happen even after I asked.

-  May didn't tell the other friend that was supposed to go as well ,let's call her Jenna , that no one else will be there.

- Jenna lives far away so if she came along,she would be in the same situation if I went . So that's why she agreed with me.

- About me rejecting the invite after she called the second time. I didn't want to go for several reasons,as I've mentioned if I got bored  or if I was uncomfortable I couldn't go home because of transportation. Second,May   has this weird flirty personality whenever she's hanging out with a guy and I didn't want to be a third wheel. 


- May didn't want to be alone with her guy friend because she said it's embarrassing ( not to be seen with him but like she is 'shy')  even tho she's leading him on and flirts with him .


- When I said , she's going to check if I'm still going is because she didn't really know if the party is going to happen on Saturday,so she said that she'll call me back before Saturday to tell me if the party is still happening,she never did.

So that's about it with this edit,if you have any more questions ask away!

We were introduced by our friends, Spencer (27M) and Ashley (25F), who recently started dating at the time. Spencer has known Ken since high school, and I‚Äôve been friends with Ashley since I was 11.

Before Ken and I started dating, he had a girlfriend, Beca. Beca knew Spencer and had met Ashley a few times. I had also met Beca before, but Ken and Beca were just friends at that time. Fast forward, Ken and I have been together for almost four years and are engaged.
A few months ago, Ken and I were invited to a party at Ashley and Spencer‚Äôs house. To our surprise, Beca showed up. We hadn‚Äôt seen her since we officially started dating. Spencer came over and said, ‚ÄúHey guys, I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt know Beca would be here.‚Äù Ken and I thought it was Spencer and Ashley‚Äôs roommate, Max, who invited her. Max is a longtime friend of Ken‚Äôs, so we shrugged it off.

During the party, several friends approached us, acknowledging how odd it was for Beca to be there, but making sure we were okay. The next day, Ken called Max to set boundaries and ask to be notified if Beca would be invited to future events. Max explained that Spencer had considered inviting Beca, but they both agreed it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to us, so Max was surprised to see her too. This made things seem odd, so Ken spoke to Spencer, and they came to an agreement. Spencer apologized, saying he and Beca were just good friends. However, I was disappointed that Spencer tried to blame someone else for Beca‚Äôs presence.

Weeks later, Ken and I were invited to another party at Ashley and Spencer‚Äôs. We assumed Beca wouldn‚Äôt be invited but called Spencer to confirm. Spencer revealed that Ashley had invited Beca. In response, Ken and I declined the invitation. Shortly after, I received a message from Ashley, pleading for me to attend and assuring me it wouldn‚Äôt be uncomfortable. I told her my concern wasn‚Äôt discomfort, but the fact that it felt disrespectful for them to continue forcing us and our friends into a situation with someone we had respectfully separated from three years ago.

I‚Äôm the years after that she had off and on relationships with boys, but never any girls. Eventually though, she meet a girl that she really liked, and, they started dating.
Now, my sister never told my parents, because they are very judgmental, and even the relationships with boys were looked at with suspicion (sex before marriage is basically worse then murder in my family) 

Eventually, my sister let it slip in a conversation with me that she was dating a girl, I was completely fine with it, but she also begged that I keep it from my parents, I agreed, knowing how they can be

They eventually asked her what was wrong, and she admitted that she was in a relationship, but told them that it was with a boy.

I will be leaving out key details so you hopefully can't find out anyone's identification, if you find my mothers information please keep it to yourself.

When I was 3 my dad was out of the picture due to being in the special forces, my mother was as left alone to watch me and my brother.
We was often neglected, left home alone, wasnt fed, and physically abused. I ended up having my arms broken, several ribs, as well as several fingers and toes. My brother didn't get off so lucky and she ended up killing him right in front of me. She went to jail for a very short amount of time.

As an adult I finally understand what my dad went through, though I would never do the same to my kid if I was in the same situation. My mother would also beat my dad, she even ran him over with a car several times.

My mother got out of prison after a very short sentence. I eventually learned more about the case and found out the court case didn't include the abuse to either of us just the fact that she kill my brother and she pleaded insanity.

I tried to forgive my mom regardless, meeting her maybe once or twice a month. When we met all I would hear is that she wants grand children, even though the last kid she had she beat to death brutally. When I took her out to mothers day at this nice restaurant she would just talk about how she would get railed by countless guys while tied up, keep in mind I was 17 at the time and was super uncomfortable about the whole situation.

Only to be met with resistance consistently. She honestly didn't care if I was there or not as long as the child support was paid I heard nothing from her.


I truly believe she did not want me his life. Planning things on my scheduled visitations & not letting it be made up the following weekend got aggravating. When it came to things he wanted to, I was not going to stop him from doing them. I did not mind sacrificing the time. I understand he's gonna want to hang out with friends, gf & go to family events.


I made the biggest mistake telling her one day that he could come when he wanted. He has friends, a gf & is a teen. I understand I was that age once. Let him have fun. This ultimately backfired. After that phone call I saw him once more & that was it. To this day I do not know what was said to him & that was 7 years ago. I couldn't have his phone number or email. To be clear he's now an adult & I still don't know his phone #. He refuses to see or speak to me or anyone on my side of the family. 


She let him talk to my mother before she passed so she could say goodbye, only to turn & say I kept it from him. Knowing I told her long before.


I ended up having a conversation with a friend about this as she had asked me about it. I told her I've yet to hear from him & am not worried about it. I've stopped worrying about things I can't control long ago. 


She asked me a question ""HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HE NEVER bothered with you for the rest of your life, never let you know if you were a grandparent & just never let you know anything about his life?"" 


I told her I had thought about that before & to be honest it wouldn't bother me. I've been estranged for 7 years now. I've missed all the major milestones, missed seeing him become an adult, at this point I have no idea who he is & he is basically a stranger to me. At some point you accept that this your situation and there's not much you can do. 


After a while you stop caring because you realize you'll drive yourself crazy & keep yourself depressed for something you have 0 control over.


This answer did not go over well. Let me state this first; she's married & has children. I believe this will add context to why she responded the way she did. Which I understood & respected as we all have our views, but I do not agree with. 


She said that I am have become heartless, cold & can't believe I'd think that way after the all the years of fighting I did.

105,1g0rn9n,AITA for being mad that our cat sitters didn't scoop the litter for 2 weeks?,"This happened years ago but I get so annoyed every time I think about it so I need verdicts.

My boyfriend and I had an arrangement with a couple we were friends with where we would watch each other's cats whenever we traveled. They took advantage of it much more often because they went on a lot of vacations, had family in other states, plus more money to travel. Our family is local and we're homebodies so our cats rarely needed watching and always for no more than 3-4 days. This didn't bother us because we love animals and are always happy to care for them with no payment or anything expected. As far as we knew this arrangement was a happy one on both sides. 

This was until we planned a very rare (for us) trip for two weeks. The couple we knew instantly agreed to watch our three cats and we were relieved to have that sorted.

CUT TO the day we got back. I walked inside and was instantly hit with the stench of ammonia. Our ""friends"" had not scooped the litter boxes even once in the two weeks we were gone. Each box contained a solid block of pee-soldered litter festooned with copious amounts of stool. At some point the cats had started peeing on our clothes and couch and I do not blame them. We were not mad at the cats and felt terrible for the stressful time they had endured. We had to deal with this massive biohazard situation and run out to get new litter boxes and products to deodorize the couch.

We were enraged and could not imagine why this happened. The couple was indignant and baffled that we were so upset. They felt that ""taking care of the cats"" just meant feeding them and checking the water dish, not scooping the litter. This makes no sense since they had cats of their own for most of their lives so they know that litter is part of it. We ALWAYS scooped their cats' litter when we were watching them, so I don't know where they thought all that pee and poop was going while they were away\*. We left them an instruction sheet with the cats' diets and serving portion but did not specify scooping because we thought that any rational person would know you need to scoop litter and we left the scoop out. They refused to apologize or reimburse us for the new litter boxes and sanitation supplies, and basically acted like we were the AHs for being upset. They said things like ""you weren't even paying us!"" even though we had performed the same duties for them far more times and always for free.

They are wealthy, by the way, thanks to a lucky stock option early on in the man's career. They don't need the money.

So are we the AHs for cutting them out of our lives? If they had acknowledged wrongdoing and apologized it might have been different but they were 100% obstinate that we were being unreasonable in our expectations and our anger.
