0,1g0cxor,AITA for joking a person in drag as charli xcx voice sounded deeper than usual? ,"Tonight I went to the sweat tour (charli xcx,troye,shygirl) concert with some friends and we loved it. One thing I feel awful about that I cant stop replaying in my head is that when we got there there was a person in drag as charli, they looked amazing and I asked for a picture. When I went up to them and their friend I decided to joking be like “omg hi charli can i get a pic” like being silly and playing that theyre really charlie. They said of course, they made a joke and I stupidly was like “oh wow charli your voice sounds deeper than normal!”. I realize now how bad that comes off as a cis woman approaching them in drag, and their friend immediately was like “no, no, we dont say things like that, that was transphobic”. Immediately apologized and looked back at the person in drag and apologized to them as well, but she said its okay “ill still take a oic with you. “. 

I took the pic and walked away stunned because honestly I didn’t mean it like that at all. I was just trying to make light of being in drag at a concert and playing along with the fun of it. I guess i thought it was okay to make jokes like that because I’ve seen so many drag queens and queer people make those jokes with one another. I honestly feel really bad and I regret not explaining how I totally didn’t mean it that way. 

I don’t even know what I was thinking and just bc I am a queer woman thats doesn’t let me just make jokes at that sort of expense. Was it really that bad of a joke to make ? I guess I was wondering about the opinions drag queens or other gender bending artists feel about receiving jokes from people who aren’t trans. I really hope it didn’t make them feel bad. I feel so stupid and I will def be more mindful with those types of things. ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-10-10,"AITA for joking a person in drag as charli xcx voice sounded deeper than usual?

1,1g0qtx7,AITA For Not Going To Varsity's Game Because of One Girl?,"Hi everyone. I'll try to keep it short and sweet so as to not take up the word cap. I'm a freshman playing volleyball for JV(Junior Varsity) and I've been playing since middle school and under the same school since middle school. I've been playing with a girl I'll call Meela. She's a very annoying person, always nitpicking what others are doing, and very two-faced. When we first tried out, we were on the freshman team she never wanted to talk to others. 



So when we were moved up to JV, I was planning to be their setter until the old one came back and she put on the team for whatever reason. I hated our season. Lots of fighting and rumors Parents didn't like Meela that much and neither did my mom for the same reasons; rude, loud, and always telling people what to do. She constantly told me how to set and how to serve. Two things she sucks at. I've had many instances of me getting at her during games. At first, I told her to stop telling me what to do. I got pulled over after the game with my mom and told to be more respectful. I honestly blocked out everything she said after she laughed in my face when I told her how I felt. And after a few more games of Meela pissing me off, I yelled at her at one game and just honestly detached myself from the team except for a few people. I felt like I was forced to apologize. 



During our last game, we lost 2 games in a row. I clapped and tried to cheer up the team and Meela told me to stop and started arguing with me talking about how I was annoying her I just told her, and I quote ""Don't Meela don't! I don't have time for you!"" I raised my voice. All THREE COACHES SEEING HER AND FACING HER STARTED TO YELL AT ME! I just went mute the whole time and just watched as they forced me to be on the side the whole time. I didn't care for it or the team anymore. When we shagged balls for the last game, she tried to talk. For the sake of myself and for her safety I didn't talk to her so for 30 seconds straight her voice was in my ear asking to talk, body to body. I said stop and she kept going at me. Then she left saying fuck you and I said fuck you too. And started to trash talk me behind me. 



Now she's on varsity to show that being a ""team player"" is what gets me on varsity. And she got to play with them. We were all expected to come. I said I didn't want to go and I had no reason to see a girl who could barely pass play. They played and lost and now their season is over.



My coaches and friends say I'm an AH for not going to Vasity's game because Meela was playing. I honestly feel like I am one, but I could care less.

2,1g0qj9q,AITA for holding a grudge against an SSO?,"I (15M) go to a new school, which opened this year, where the transportation, particularly the carpool line, is a bit shambolic, with kids having to run after their cars as staff and SSOs (school security officer) just keep telling cars to move forward, even when they see their kid and it makes most sense to stop. As such, typically SSOs are getting kids to move up to the front of the pavement near the carpool line. That's where I come in. 

Me mates and I were talking and an SSO tells us to move up front as we were a bit back in the pavement. As we start doing so, I almost bump into a lady I didn't see coming. The SSO tells me to say excuse me, and on stupid teenage instinct, I say ""my bad"". Classic mistake 🤦‍♂️.SSO's quick to correct me and tell me again to say excuse me, and I do, a bit embarrassed at this point that I didn't the first time. She tells me to use my manners next time, which I nod to, but then as she walks off, says ""I know your parents probably...."".

I got pissed but kept me chin up and didn't do anything, but the remark's been scratching at me head since then, as I felt mad that she felt the need to bad mouth my parents. I told my dad about it, and he says I should calmly bring it up to her again tomorrow, which I also thought would be the thing to do. The thing is, since I couldn't make out what she said after ""probably"", I'm only assuming she said something negative about my parents since she seemed generally unhappy with me by the end, which makes it seem a bit unfair for me to hold this grudge. Even more so, I know she's just trying to do her job, and dealing with people my age, let alone that many, can definitely be a handful.

3,1g0q9wk,AITA for not getting a perm?,"AITA for not wanting to get a perm for my sister's wedding?

I (28f) am supposed to be my sister's (26f) maid of honor. We are and always have been super close and have a great relationship, so I have no idea, how this could have escalated this badly.
I have long, very straight hair, that doesn't hold a curl for longer than 2 hours at most, no matter what products or tools you use. It also not colored but completely virgin hair, which also makes it less likely to hold onto any kind of curls. I love curls, but I've accepted my fate and don't see a point in spending a long time to try and style it, just for everything to be gone an hour later.
My sister insists on all women in the wedding having their hair styled with curls. I can and would let the best hairstylist ever curl my hair - I know it won't hold up during the day, and my sister knows it, too. 
Because of that she has gotten the idea into her head, that I should just get a perm, so I would be able to wear my hair curly at her wedding. I don't want to do that?? I have several years of length in my hair and a perm would mean I'd have to keep up this very time intensive style I didn't even chose or chop my perm-damaged hair of afterwards?

I'd do a lot to make my sister happy and I want her to have a lovely wedding, but I think her demand is absolutely ridiculous. She goes on and on about how I want to ruin her perfect day and how I'd only do that, because I'm jealous of her getting married before me (not true at all).

4,1g0q9vg,AITA for Not Tipping,"I go to a Bruegger's Bagels about once every other week, a very suburban Bagel chain that serves Bagels, Bagels as Sandwiches, and a array of other breakfast goods.

Today I got in there around 1:30, 30 minutes before closing. I'm the only customer, it's a small location, with two people behind the counter.

I order two bagels with cream cheese, toasted.

The person manning the cash register rings me up, I input my debit card, I don't tip. They hand me the bag a minute later, I say thanks, and leave out the door.

I get home and open the bag, and the bagels are poorly toasted (ie, only slightly warm, and my house is 3 minutes away from the location) and also not cut. It's a silly thing to write on the internet about, the food is totally fine to eat and it tastes mostly good, but it strikes me as a sloppy job.

First, I jump to the conclusion that I didn't tip, and they were like ""fuck this guy"" and did the bare minimum.

My personal stance on tipping is that if I'm standing at a cashier and ordering food that's going to come out a moment or a few moments later tipping is totally off the table. It kinda pisses me off when some places turn the card reader around and it says 25% tip as the base.

If I had ordered something complex, or something where a person was going to put effort into that item, I would have tipped. But what I ordered strikes me as almost the simplest item on the menu to curate.

I think the reason why I'm writing on this form about this is because this isn't the first time this has happened at this location. In previous months, again where I was not tipping and ordering the same order, there were similar small errors, mostly around the bagel not being toasted (usually not at all), poorly cut or not cut, etc.

I also thought about the angle of ""it's late in the day for this person's shift, perhaps they are just really tired and are missing the mark"" which is somewhat understandable but it's shitty for me and my experience buying a overpriced bagel. But I thought back to the incidents that occurred over the past few months and thought that I might be the asshole not throwing them a extra couple of dollars.

Right now my mindset is that I'm just going to avoid that joint and use other breakfast food options, and to also just get my own bagel supplies from the grocery store. I stopped going to that Bruegger's after being previously annoyed at their service, and thought to give them another go recently, but I think it's over with them.

As an aside, this is a non-conclusive list of scenarios where I would totally tip:

1. I sit down and food is brought to me / a server comes to my table.  
2. I am given advice on what I should do/order.  
3. I know/see the individual regularly and we have good interactions.  
4. There's some type of 'skill' or craftsmanship put into the product.  
5. I spend a extended period of time with that person for that service (ie, a Uber ride).

I used to work in the service industry, in my opinion it's almost always a shitty place to be. I personally think that tipping shouldn't exist because it's mostly a tool for corporations and small businesses to pass on costs to the customer rather than provide people a stable working income. It's just bad for the working class in my opinion.

7,1g0plhq,AITA for buying a portable AC/Humidifier?,"AITA for buying a portable AC for my room?

for context, I (21F) live in a college apartment with 2 other girls around my age. The thermostat we have controls the entire apartment. For the first month of living there, my roommates and I couldn’t agree on a temperature. We went back and forth between turning it up and down, but we weren’t discussing it. For context, I run very hot, my comfort level is like 65-66. However, i understand that is really cold for other people. I was willing to compromise up to 69, because thats about as high as it can go for me to be comfortable in the house. However, the problem arises when the AC was completely shut off without consulting me. The reason I was given was to save money, because we do pay the utility bill excluded from our rent. This made the apartment uncomfortable for me, as there was no air flow, and it got uncomfortably hot in my room. My room would heat up even more because the sun shines right into my room. I tried to turn the AC back on quite a few times, and each time it was turned right back off before my room could even cool down again. Instead of fighting about this, I got a portable air conditioner/dehumidifier for my room only. I figured this would solve the issue, because then I could keep my room at the 65-66 that I liked, and they could keep the central AC off as they liked. I got a text yesterday though, saying it was frustrating and inconsiderate of me to get a portable AC without talking to them about it, because they do not want a “super high electric bill.” I have looked at the billing statements from when they turned off the AC, and they saved no money from doing so. I do not know if my AC will significantly impact the utility bill, but as its only cooling one room, and only when I am physically in the room (i turn it off to go to work, school, gym, etc) I do not see how this is an issue, as we haven’t even seen the billing statement for from the time I bought the unit. I also don’t see why I have to consult them about buying the unit, when they don’t have to consult me about turning off the AC and leaving it off indefinitely.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for buying a portable AC/Humidifier?

This made the apartment uncomfortable for me, as there was no air flow, and it got uncomfortably hot in my room. My room would heat up even more because the sun shines right into my room. I tried to turn the AC back on quite a few times, and each time it was turned right back off before my room could even cool down again. Instead of fighting about this, I got a portable air conditioner/dehumidifier for my room only. I figured this would solve the issue, because then I could keep my room at the 65-66 that I liked, and they could keep the central AC off as they liked. I got a text yesterday though, saying it was frustrating and inconsiderate of me to get a portable AC without talking to them about it, because they do not want a “super high electric bill.” I have looked at the billing statements from when they turned off the AC, and they saved no money from doing so. I do not know if my AC will significantly impact the utility bill, but as its only cooling one room, and only when I am physically in the room (i turn it off to go to work, school, gym, etc) I do not see how this is an issue, as we haven’t even seen the billing statement for from the time I bought the unit. I also don’t see why I have to consult them about buying the unit, when they don’t have to consult me about turning off the AC and leaving it off indefinitely.",0.0,0.0557127371430397,0,1

I loved that idea considering he likes to help clean. If he had his own stuff he can do it by himself if he wanted to without us having to watch and make sure he wasn’t swinging and hitting things. Well, I told my nana what my sister was going to get him for Christmas, and how cool it was.

9,1g0p5os,AITA for not letting my husband go on ANOTHER vacation with his friend?,"We've always kept our $ separate and split bills evenly. We made roughly the same $ so it wasn't an issue. We had our first child 1.5y ago. I was working p/t a lot of my preg and after my 12w leave b/c we couldn't find daycare. I also just started my own business but it's taking longer to get clients so I'm currently not even making enough $ to cover ""my half"" of the bills. I started working 16h shifts on w/ends to make more $ but it's not enough. I do all of the cooking, cleaning, and most things for our son. I'm still nursing him. My hub has never given him a bath. I have done EVERY SINGLE night waking (he still wakes 1-2 /night). My hub works mostly f/t but does whatever he wants when he comes home and on the w/ends.

We've traveled a lot together. B4 we started TTC, we talked about how we will have to put travel on hold for a bit. He agreed and was fine with it. That turned into having 1 more trip before TTC so we went to Greece. Once preg it was 1 more trip b4 he's born so we went to Iceland. Then he planned another trip with his friend to Spain w/out me knowing and told me about 2w before he left. I was 28w preg and very upset. Then he tried going to Mexico with his BIL 2w b/4 my due date and I talked him out of it. Then we went on a trip to MA when our son was 3m and then to CO when he was 10m. Then he went to Mexico with his BIL a few m ago which he told me about days before he left. I just found out he is planning another trip with his friend to Albania w/o me knowing AGAIN.

10,1g0ohzv,AITA for cursing out my Aunt?,"I (32M) grew up in a very conservative Christian family. I left the church when I was 28 simply because I realized that while I had respect for Christianity as a religion, it was not something that I personally believed in. On top of that I came out as bisexual and I’ve seen how a lot of people in the LGBTQ community are treated by a lot of people in the church.

my aunt Gia (60F) has always had reputation in the family as a gossip, and also is notorious for her mean spirited behavior. On top of that she is what I call a super Christian and believes in forcing her religion down everybody’s throats. As you can probably guess my aunt is extremely homophobic and as a result, I never told her about my sexuality simply because I did not want the drama.

Somehow last year she found out and according to the rest of my family members, she had a meltdown. And ever since then she has been posting a lot of homophobic rhetoric on Facebook.

Now, normally I would not say anything to her about it because I have been conditioned from birth to be a complete pushover, but I’m not going to lie, It started to bother me because it started feeling like a personal attack. Needless to say our relationship is not good for the past year because I cannot see myself being close to somebody who has these negative opinions about me.

Yesterday, I was at work when I went on Facebook and saw that she once again posted homophobic rhetoric. So I decided that she was comfortable posting such hatefulness on the Internet. I would then intern let her know how I feel about it publicly. So I decided to comment under her post and this is what I said:

 “Every time you post shit like this it reminds me why I left Christianity.. it’s one thing to have your own beliefs and opinions but it’s another thing to to attack a community because the believe differently than you.. this is not the first time you have posted stuff like this ..every time you post shit like this make me NOT want to call you my family because I refuse to associate with individuals who are this hateful.. doesn’t  1 John 4:8  say that God is love? How could a loving god breed such hatefulness? Sad… but I mean I guess it’s true what they say “ there’s no hate like a Christian love“

A couple hours later I started getting phone calls from my family members asking if I was OK because apparently my aunt is now upset claiming that I “cursed her out on Facebook”. On top of that, she’s refusing to now come to our families Thanksgiving celebration if I’m there

If I’m being completely honest, I don’t think I said anything in that comment that was rude. At the most I used two  curse words, but neither of them were directed at her specifically but more at the things that she was posting.

Most of my family is on my side and state that while I probably should’ve not used profanity, I was completely right with what I said, but some of my friends think that I went too far because she’s family.

I, M26, recently discovered that my brother, 19, was playing a video game that we both had been looking forward to. I was excited and asked him if he bought it on Steam or what. He responded “I got it for free”. At first, I thought that his girlfriend gifted it to him, because she occasionally does that. So, I checked the gift history on the Steam account and found nothing. He explained to me that he downloaded it from a website. 

Immediately, I am not only extremely disappointed, but concerned, for a multitude of reasons. 

Firstly, we come from a family of criminals and thieves. I don’t want to see him go down that path. I asked him why he did this and he said “why would I spend money if I don’t have to?”. I explained to him that this is no different than walking into a gas station and stealing a candy bar because you didn’t feel like paying for it. I am worried that this could be the start of him stealing physical items next. 

Next, I work in IT and am concerned about the security. He refuses to send me the website and I respect his privacy enough to not get on his computer when he isn’t home. He doesn’t use a VPN or anything either. I don’t pirate, but I do use a VPN for my security. 

Finally, I am disappointed that he is refusing to support the hardworking creators of the game. When I brought this up to him, he said “I don’t care about corporations”. I handle all of the bills alongside my grandpa since my brother is in school. We purchased his phone and his phone also. His refund money is his to do as he pleases. 

In conclusion, I understand wanting to save money. However, I believe that’s why sales exist. I do not find any form of theft acceptable, especially with my family history. My brother keeps telling me to shut up about this and that it’s not a big deal.

Been together 6 years, finally moving in together after finishing school. He's 30 and I'm 28. He makes 85k and I make 58k. He contributes 25% to his 401k and has savings on top of that (almost 60k) and is agreeing to drop it to 12% when we move in together. Rent is 2200 in Socal. I contribute 6% to my 401k and have 18k in savings. Originally he said he would cover rent and I could cover groceries and utilities since I have a car payment ($500) and student loans (4k). Now he says he doesn't think he should cover all the rent since he won't be able to save. Not 50/50 but he thinks it should be more proportional. 

I'm of the thought that he wants to save more at the expense of my savings and my 401k. If I have to pay some rent, I won't be able to save as much either when I already have significantly less in savings than he does. He's shown me the trajectory of his 401K which is set to have him be a millionaire at 40 and I can't help but think that when we move in I'll be struggling to save while he's on track to be a millionaire. 

My compromise was this: I'll pay some rent up until we get married in 2026 BUT after that he's paying the rent. Our savings would be joint at that point anyway.

I’m older so I think a child should be grateful for whatever they get for free on Halloween and not expect special treatment for a disability when getting free items. 

Edit: My wife and I decided we don't want to deal with it anymore and will be donating the chips to the local school and churches for their Halloween party. Lights off at our house. ",0.0,0.964163303375244,1,0
15,1g0llj3,AITA for “letting” my ex and my kids’ half siblings “be poor” when I could help?,"
I have an ex with whom I share two kids (13M & 12M). Our relationship did not work out and we broke up seven years ago. Since I was the financially stable one, she wanted me to have full custody. I have had full custody ever since. She has visitation, but she only uses it intermittently. Quickly after the breakup, she started dating a guy “with money.” He is from overseas. She quickly got pregnant by the guy and they had a son. The guy did not want to “raise someone else’s kids,” so she moved three hours away and completely stopped seeing our kids for almost two years. It turns out the guys’ money was actually family money, and when his conservative family found out about my ex and the baby, they cut them off. Also, their son had some developmental issues. She got pregnant again and a few months later, her BF left and returned to his home country. She is now 6-ish months pregnant with no job and taking care of a special needs kid.

She called me last week and asked me for financial help. They are living out of a motel and she is running out of money. I have a lake house about 30 minutes from her. She asked if she could stay there. I said “no.” She asked if I would send her money, I said, “no.” She called me an AH. She said that I am letting “my family” suffer unnecessarily when I have the means to help. I told I have no obligation to help. We have been arguing ever since.

16,1g0l58v,"AITA for asking the host of our band practice to turn down/off (or change genre) the blasting electronica music he is playing during setup time for our classic rock/blues band?
","TLDR: Band member who hosts band practice blasting drum and bass, stressing me out, and refused to turn it down/change to different music. AITAH for asking him to change it, and saying he was being inconsiderate after he refused? 



The guitarist of my band, who hosts our practices in his home studio, has gotten in the habit of loudly playing electronic music (drum and bass) as we are arriving and setting up. It's so loud i have to put in my 'in ear monitors' as my seat is near a speaker. Often it's too loud to carry on a normal volume conversation without borderline yelling. I should note, we play classic rock/blues and a bit of reggae/jazz/etc. This music is a huge departure from what we are there to play. 

Knowing the guitarist, I have tolerated this in the past, as I predicted he would not have a conciliatory reaction to me politely asking him to turn it down and or put on different music. However, last practice I had had a stressful day and was REALLY not in the mood to be bombarded by loud electronic music. I said something along the lines of: ""hey i had a stressful day and this music is really adding to my stress and not putting me in the mood to play music. Do you mind turning it down and maybe putting on some rock/blues or something closer to the type of music we play here as a band."" 



His response was basically ""No. I just got home and i want to listen to this."" From there things escalated rather quickly (as they often do with him), he said if the roles were reversed he wouldn't complain and would just listen to whatever music i put on no matter how much he disliked it. I said he was being selfish and inconsiderate and a bad host. He accused me of telling him ""what he can and can't listen to in his own house."" I told him he was being a bully, he responded that I'm the bully for trying to control what music he can listen to. He also accused me of ""sabotaging band practice by making an issue out of this."" 



IMO its not as simple as its ""his house"", its not like I'm telling him what he's allowed to listen to when I'm not there. Band practice is a shared activity in a shared space, that happens to be at his house because its the best location; though it could be done at another house certainly. One primary reason he hosts, is due to his allergies to other band members pets. 

I believe I'm entitled to feel comfortable and respected in a shared space. Furthermore, when hosting people in your home, you try to make your guests feel comfortable and respect their wishes if they are within reason. For example, I keep the heat quite low in my house in winter, but if a guest is cold i will happily turn it up to make them feel comfortable; in fact I do so preemptively so they don't feel they have to impose by asking.

When he said ""No, I want to listen to this"" AITA for pointing out he was being inconsiderate and not just dropping the matter entirely?

17,1g0l3ae,WIBTA for cancelling plans this weekend with friends that I committed to in September?,"Hello all.  
I am feeling stuck and awful and am not sure how to handle this. In September my friends reached out (who live two hours away from me) to invite my husband (m34) and I (f36) out to a Halloween activity three hours away or so from where we live that is ticketed. I conferred with my husband and we decided to go as it sounded fun and at the time it seemed doable. However, we're running into issues. I work away from home so I am gone during the week, only seeing my husband on weekends so we are already stressed out (for context) with trying to do what we can to manage coordinating just daily life stuff while apart and right now, circumstances are that is not going to change. We also have a diabetic cat and we have no one available now to care for her. So, now, the options are: to not go (which will hurt and disappoint our friends--there is a lot of context here too. We often have to go to them, one has had a really hard time that I have not had enough time to spend with them but it has been overwhelming and I am doing the best I can, etc), or I go and my husband stays back (I do not want to do this because I do not want to drive the three hours there and back in one day, especially late at night, or spend time trying to figure out where to stay and miss out on time seeing my husband, My car is not exactly in the best shape either).  
The event is this weekend and I know I should have never said yes in the first place but now I am dreading it and just feel overwhelmed with trying to coordinate. I can't deny there is some other stuff seeping in (some resentment that we always have to go their way, they have only been to our house once because basically we said that it needed to be fair, and my own life circumstance stress ) impacting my judgement. I truly do not want to be a flakey friend and disappoint my friends, but I just do not know what else to do besides not go at this point.

Would I be the asshole and risk hurting and disappointing my friends by cancelling plans with them that I committed to in September?

18,1g0keer,AITA for confronting my son's (16M) football coach for literally fattening him up?,"For some background, my son is 16 and has always been pretty athletic. He plays football and swims competitively, and he’s been doing both for years.

Last year, his coach told him he needed to gain weight—*a lot* of weight—like 40 pounds. The idea was to get him up to 200 pounds for this season. Now, my son, being the rule-follower and total team player that he is (plus, he can eat like no one else), didn’t question it and just went for it. The problem is, I had no idea this was happening, and it wasn’t until recently that I realized just how extreme the coach’s advice actually was.

Apparently, the coach gave him a whole list of “rules” to follow to pack on the weight quickly. We're talking calorie goals every day, specific fast food orders to hit those numbers (hello, McDonald's), drinking more soda (which we don't usually keep much of in the house), and even ordering supplements online. Now it makes sense why boxes of Boost started showing up on our doorstep out of nowhere! And to top it all off, the coach told him to cut back on cardio—including swimming, which is something he’s always loved.

I didn’t really put all the pieces together until later, but now, looking back at this summer, it’s so obvious. He wasn't running as much, and his swimming practically stopped, which was strange for him. And the food… it went from the usual healthy stuff to fast food galore. But honestly, I didn’t think much of it at the time. I just thought it was him being a lazy teenager.

Fast forward to now, and I can *definitely* see the difference. He’s already put on 35 pounds, and it shows. I hate to say this, but his stomach is starting to look like his dad’s. And he’s never had a weight problem before! He’s always been fit and active, so this feels like wrong. And I can’t help but worry this is setting him up for bigger problems later on.

I asked him what was going on, and to his credit, he was pretty upfront about it. He explained the coach’s plan, and he doesn’t seem to think it’s a big deal. Meanwhile, I’m sitting here feeling *so* guilty for not catching on sooner, and also furious at his coach for encouraging this. Both my son and my husband acted like I was overreacting. Apparently, my husband knew about it all along and was quietly supporting it! They both say I don’t “get it” because I’m more into swimming than football.

I requested a meeting with his head coach one-on-one, but husband and son both say I'm majorly overreacting, don't understand how football works these days, and that intervening made me a ""Karen."" But I’m worried about his health in the long run. AITAH for contacting his coach?

He has been wronged by a couple of women in the past couple of years (one left him and got married within three months, the other stole a lot of his money) but he seems to have a particular dislike for women selling content or just generally being confident in how they look. 

That point brings me on to my wife. She’s 39 and we’ve been together since school. She’s a very fit and attractive woman and her main hobby is pole dancing. She loves it and has been doing it for a few years. She’s really good and she loves it so much, it’s great to see her really excelling at something and being so passionate about it.

I ended up leaving and a few mutual friends have said that while I was right he’s going though a hard time and is a bit vulnerable to this way of thinking. I personally think thats bullshit and we need to tell him he’s heading down a wrong path.

I got a bit wound up at this point and asked him if he’d like to ring my wife and tell her himself? He said no he was just talking to me man to man and I need to grow a backbone. I told him I’m not the one with the backbone problem if he can’t handle a bit of flesh and gets offended by it and he’s the weak one. 

I ended up leaving and a few mutual friends have said that while I was right he’s going though a hard time and is a bit vulnerable to this way of thinking. I personally think thats bullshit and we need to tell him he’s heading down a wrong path. 

Me and my friend are both 41 I forgot to mention that. 

TLDR: friend is heading down a Tate wormhole and said my wife shouldn’t be posting pictures of herself pole dancing. I told him to grow up and not be so easily offended. ",0.0,1.0066958665847778,1,0
22,1g0jthe,AITA for calling out a trainer who keeps sneaking up at me/us at the gym?,"
Some background: been boxing for 6-8 months and have experience in grappling at a reputable MMA gym. A trainer at this regular gym I go to has previously approached me with unsolicited critique but when asked couldn’t provide any direct feedback on what I was doing wrong, which I found annoying but handled politely the first time around. He offered to “train” me which I said I’d consider and let him know.

Today, I saw a beginner who looked like he had no prior training, so I kindly asked if he wanted some unsolicited advice in between his sets and when he was facing me. He was very receptive, even giving me fist bumps.

The same trainer then decided to interrupt us from behind, commenting on how I said I’m not an expert. (Iirc I told the beginner “I’m not exactly an expert but I’ve been training for about 7 months now, can i show you how to and when to jab?) When i calmly but firmly pointed out that he wasn’t part of our conversation and explained that his interruptions come off as condescending. He acted surprised and claimed I was being hostile, and asked how he was offensive. After explaining that this wasn’t my first interaction with him, I also let him know what he said and asked how he would interpret that if the roles were reversed.

He didn’t seem to have an answer for that 
Or anything else after I walked him through the facts and he decided to end the conversation neutrally after explaining how his words could come across (ie saying that he can tell I’m not an “expert” as his opener to us? ) but now I’m questioning if I overreacted. 

 At the end, the beginner I approached asked if the training of his was free, and I heard him slightly scoff at that statement lol.

I’ve noticed over the past year that Emily tends to stretch the truth or flat-out lie about things, both big and small. At first, it was little things like saying she couldn’t come to family dinners because of work, only to post on social media that she was out with friends. Then it escalated to bigger things.

One example that really bothered me happened recently. We were both supposed to attend a charity fundraiser I was there the entire evening and never saw her. When I later asked if she had made it, she insisted that she had been there the whole time and even said she saw me but was too busy to come say hi. This wasn’t true—I know for a fact she wasn’t there the volenteers list was small and I definitely would have seen her. We were all in the same room.

More recently, she lied about something involving a family event. We were planning a small gathering for my husband’s birthday, and Emily told me she’d arranged a cake from his favorite bakery. The day of the party, she showed up empty-handed, claiming they “lost the order.” When I called the bakery to see what happened, they had no record of any order ever being placed. 

That was the last straw for me.

I pulled her aside later and confronted her about her constant lying. I tried to be calm and respectful, but I told her that her dishonesty was starting to affect how I viewed her and that it was creating tension in the family. She literally messed up my husband birthday with these lies.  

She completely denied it and got really upset, saying I was making her out to be a bad person and that I was overreacting. My son got involved and is now angry with me.

A lady in her 50s-60s cut the queue just right behind me. It was the moment where people started walking so no one bothered saying anything.

I settled into my seat next the the aisle (row C), minding my own business with my earphones in but slowly realised that the aisle traffic congested hard so I looked up.

Turns out that lady just stood there like a statue, frozr and blocked the way of the passengers behind her.

I could tell because she didn't want to lift her stuff by herself. She wasn't big, but wasn't small either.

I was about to pack my earphones away so I could help (I'm a Thai Aussie so like I'm double friendly). She saw me moving so she turned to me and do that finger clicking thing in my face to get my attention and said ""You help?"". I work hospitality and I fucking hate that shit.

But it was that moment of confusion, if you know what I mean, like I was gonna help anyway so might as well just help her, so people get to move on.

But shit I had the worst flight. She interrupts my movie so I could open her water bottle. She interrupts my game to unpack her snack. I was sleeping and she literally turned on the light on purpose to wake me up for some stupid shit that I had now started to ignore.

Also whatever I did for her she never said thank you or smile, none.

The plane landed and she did the same shit to me again but now demanding me retrieving the luggage for her. I declined in the most polite way possible : ""I think you should ask the staff to assist you""

 I thought I would feel good, but I could sense all eyes looking at me like ""wow this dude heartless af""

28,1g0h9h3,AITA for refusing to lend my parents money?,"

I (25F) live with my parents and four other family members. We’re a six-member household, and while I have a job that covers my living expenses, my salary barely stretches far enough to cover my own bills. My parents have a habit of borrowing money from me, but the issue is they never seem to pay it back unless I nag them—at which point they get extremely aggressive and verbal about it. They either say they’ll pay when they can, or they guilt-trip me about needing to help “the family.”

On the other hand, they also borrow from my sibling (30M). For some reason, they always prioritize paying him back on time or at least give him clear updates. But when it comes to me, they just seem to conveniently forget about it. If I even try to ask for a repayment date, it becomes a full-blown argument where I’m made to feel like I’m selfish for needing the money back.

Recently, they asked me to lend them a significant amount of money again. I’m already stretched thin with my own expenses and simply can’t afford it. So, I said no, politely explaining that I have my own bills to handle. Since then, my parents have been acting really passive-aggressive. They’re giving me the silent treatment and making snide comments that I can hear, things like, “Some people don’t care about family” or “Must be nice to just think of yourself.”

Now I’m starting to feel guilty, but at the same time, I’m frustrated. It’s not like I’ve never helped them, but when I do, they treat me horribly if I ever need the money back. I feel like they’re taking advantage of me.

He’s decided to have a really small wedding just a handful of close friends and family and he’s not inviting my husband (30M).

To give you some background, my brother has never really liked my husband and they’ve had their fair share of disagreements over the years. I always thought that regardless of their differences, family should come together for important moments like this. When I expressed my disappointment about my husband not being invited, my brother told me it’s his wedding and he wants it to be intimate with people he feels comfortable around.

I felt pretty strongly about it and told him that I wouldn’t be attending if my husband wasn’t invited. For me, it’s a package deal. My husband and I are a team and it just feels unfair to make me choose between supporting my brother and supporting my husband. Now my brother is upset and thinks I’m being dramatic, saying I’m putting him in a tough position.

To complicate things, some family members have jumped in, saying I’m being unreasonable and that my brother deserves to have the wedding he wants without feeling guilty about inviting someone he doesn’t want there. I believe in family loyalty, but I’m starting to wonder if I’m overreacting by saying I won’t go.

Everything is great so far, but one thing really bothers me. My bf makes a very good money as a programmer. I used to be a freelancer too 2 years ago but I lost my job and went through a severe depressive episode, so I started working as a part-time cleaner. My income wasn’t really an issue for me because my job really fulfills all my needs because it is flexible, low stress and helps to clear my mind. I work with elderly clients and I am also something like a companion. This job fulfills me more than what I used to do when I made more money. It allows me to take more sick leave in case I get an episode (I also have an anxiety disorder, BPD and ADHD and take disability benefits for it).

I worked on myself in therapy for 8 years and I am stable enough to be in a relationship, so we don’t have any issues when comes to my mental health. But I just make a fraction of what my bf makes. I recently got kicked out of my cheap rent flat because the landlord didn’t prolong my contract (they gave the flat to a family member). It completely crushed me and I started being depressed because I didn’ t have enough money to rent a place. My bf offered for us to move in together, but because he is used to a different standard of living, the rent for our current flat is totally out of my means. We agreed that I will do all the housework and chores while paying only third of the rent and buying all our food and drinks.

I am scared my bf might start to resent me for my low income and I feel like I should find a better paying job. But my experience with any higher-pressure job was constant mental breakdowns and trips to the psychiatrist followed by long sick leaves (not many jobs tolerate that). I also can’t work more than 6 hours a day to keep myself from spiraling into another episode. I am on medication and seeing a psychiatrist regularly, but the medication limits my mental performance quite a bit. I tried talking about changing medication but my doctor says it’s not advisable to lower my doses. This medication actually works well, but there’s many side effects. I got fired 4 times because I just failed to perform. My bf said it is fine the way it is but at the same time he occasionally drops comments about me maybe starting a teaching job and advancing my career.

I’m a 24-year-old woman, and I’ve been dating my boyfriend, let’s call him Mark, for about a year. My birthday was coming up, and I had to make a choice: spend it with Mark or with my family. Now, for context, my family is really close, and birthdays are a big deal for us. They go all out with celebrations, and since I had been so busy with work lately, I was really looking forward to some time with them.

When I told Mark that I wanted to spend the day with my family, he wasn’t thrilled. He had planned a special day for just the two of us and felt hurt that I didn’t want to spend my birthday with him. He even said I was being selfish for choosing my family over him, especially since we’ve been together for a while now. I tried explaining that this was just how we did things in my family, but he kept pushing the idea that I should be with him, saying that as my boyfriend, he should come first on such an important day.

So, I stuck to my decision and spent the day with my family. We had a great time—my mom made my favorite meal, and my little siblings decorated the house. I did feel a bit guilty about leaving Mark out, but I figured we could celebrate the next day.

Here’s where the twist comes in. That night, after the party was winding down, I got a call from one of Mark’s friends. Turns out, Mark hadn’t actually planned anything special. He’d mentioned to his friends that he wasn’t really into big celebrations and was just trying to see if I’d prioritize him over my family. To make things worse, I found out that while I was with my family, he spent the day gaming with his buddies and didn’t seem upset at all.

So, was I the asshole for choosing my family over Mark on my birthday? I don’t think so anymore, especially after finding out that he wasn’t even serious about his plans.

35,1g0fh5l,WIBTAh (for naming my daughter the same as my niece),"Want some opinions, especially if you’ve been the child in this situation. 
I’ve had a dream name for a future daughter picked out for over a decade and when I shared it with my husband he loved it too, (Going to use “Mary Sue” as a placeholder for privacy). 
Hubby and I have been ttc for years due to me having pcos and while we’ve been trying his brother and wife have had a baby. 
The ‘problem’ is that they named their daughter “Mary Jane”. 
It was heartbreaking for me that they used the first name I have had my heart set on because it just highlighted the fact I hadn’t been able to have my own daughter, like she replaced my baby. 

Well now I’m finally pregnant and just passed the end of my second trimester so things are looking good and we’re discussing names. 
I still really want to use “Mary Sue” but my husband says it would be weird if she had the same first name as her cousin. 
I argued that it wouldn’t feel like the same name because this name has several popular nicknames and they use a different one than we had planned. 

He says we shouldn’t do it because it will cause drama between him and his brother because they are very uptight and get snooty and think everything is about them so they’ll assume we did it on purpose out of spite or something and they’ll just be passive aggressive and make interactions between us awkward. 

Only recently has this changed. For years they we’re basically indifferent to each other just quick awkward “hi how are you”s at family gatherings. 
They never had a fight or anything they just never got close or connected the way a lot of brothers do. 

Now we all talk a little more, though it’s definitely still stunted and awkward conversation but we all try. 
So we don’t want to rock the boat, but should we have to tiptoe around them?? 

So if you were ever a parent in this situation or a kid with the same name as your cousin please tell me how you felt.

36,1g0ffex,AITA for calling my stepmom selfish during family therapy?,"I'm (17f) in family therapy with my dad and stepmom. My dad wanted us to talk through our problems because my stepmom has been really upset lately that I have shut her out of my life in a pretty big way and she just wants to be closer. My mom died when I was 5 and I have two older brothers who are 20 and 23. My stepmom moved in when I was 8 and she and my dad got married when I was almost 11. We always got along okay. But I never thought of her as like a second mom or as the strongest mom figure in my life. 

My mom left videos for each of us. My dad got some birthday ones and a Christmas and wedding anniversary video. My brothers and I got every birthday until 18 that she'd miss, milestone birthdays, Christmas and big events like our own weddings and babies. After dad remarried I started to watch mine more at Christmas and I'd maybe watch my birthday videos twice. My dad remarrying made me think of mom more and made me miss her more. It felt more real that life had moved on without her and dad really fell in love with someone else. My dad watched his whenever his birthday or Christmas would happen too. But a year after he remarried he turned 40 and she started making faces whenever one of us would watch a mom video. And whenever dad would smile watching the video she would look annoyed/pissed. After that she suggested she could keep mine safe for me because I was so young but I didn't trust her to do that.

After three years of noticing this stuff, she told dad the videos made her unhappy and uncomfortable and she felt like an outsider at Christmas when he looked so in love with my mom. She also said she felt like the videos were a road block between her and us (me and my brothers). Dad compromised that he would watch his less and she wouldn't say anything to us. I saw my dad struggle with that for years. I saw him go to watch one of mom's videos and stop himself. Then my stepmom and I started fighting because I didn't want her to touch the disks the messages were recorded on. She was also upset when my brothers did backups of all the disks so we'd always have the messages even if the originals were broken. She told us we valued those more than we valued most people. Dad told her to leave us alone. But I stopped being as friendly with her as I was and shut her out. I left her out of prom stuff last year that she wanted to do with me and I always say no to hanging out with her.

This brought us to therapy and last week I spoke my mind and said I think she's incredibly selfish for making dad feel bad about watching the videos mom left for him. I said mom was his first wife, the mother of his children and if she really loved him she'd want him to have them. But she doesn't like knowing she came second and yet she joined the family anyway.

Now I should add for context I have attended 5 weddings over the last two years and none of them had a specific dress code.

One of my coworkers is getting married next June and after I received the invite she asked what I’d be wearing and I told her that I would wear my regular black dress (I don’t have a lot of others - the only ones I do are very formal). 

She told me after that she actually has imposed a dress code (which was not mentioned on the invite) and that everyone should be wearing red as she was going to wear black.

I agreed and said I’d get to buying a nice one. However, when I spoke to my other coworkers none of them mentioned anything about a dress code - one of them even asked her (the bride - “Maria”) and Maria said there was no dress code. 

Initially I thought this was confusing, and maybe she changed her mind and forgot to tell me, so when I asked my coworker to ask her, Maria said, “I don’t like the black dress she always wears, it’s old and unflattering and I would rather my guests look presentable at my wedding.”

I always felt good in the dress, it is old (I bought it for my sophomore prom) but I felt as if it still worked. 

I texted Maria that I wouldn’t be able to attend her wedding. She came up to me at work and put a sweet act on about how she thought we were friends and she really wanted me there.

Eventually I told her I was not planning on buying a new dress because I heard what she said about my black one. Maria said I was mistaken but I know I was not.

Even though she apologised, she texted me later that I am uninvited from her wedding as she would rather not have a broke teenager ruining all her photos.

I spoke to my friend about this, and he thinks I could have just bought a cheap red dress and avoided all the drama.

It's not ideal but my upstairs neighbour's water isolation tap is in my private courtyard but I have always given access to previous owners.

About a week after that the Owners Corp asked me for them to access the isolation tap so they could do plumbing works.  I wasn't paying attention to what they were doing as I was busy with family but after they left I discovered they'd placed a long copper pipe up the middle of my wall (the pipes were previously all internal). I complained and the OC issued a breach notice to remove it within 28 days.  They continued with their renovations and on day 25 asked if they could move the pipe to run along the bottom of my wall instead - less noticeable.  I rejected that also.  My reasoning was the OC plumber had told me there would have been an easy solution that didn't involve my property if they weren't such ""cowboys"" and gutted everything - his words.

Long story short, she got lawyers involved to send myself and OC a letter refusing to remove the pipe and would take us to VCAT in the matter if we tried to.  They are now saying it's too late to put it back the way it was and implement the easy solution and that it would cost them $10k to pull everything out.

I wouldn't say my family is poor, but we can't afford too many luxuries or waste too much money on things that we can't all benefit from in some way.

I live with my mother (39F), my brother (8M) and my mother's boyfriend (35M). My parents separated when I was 4 years old and the separation was not very amicable, I have memories of my father breaking things and hurting my mother, memories which I have only recently begun to remember, but he never hurt me, and in fact, I have good memories with him, he even spoiled me a lot with toys that I liked at that time, I loved him a lot.

But one day, when I was about 8, he stopped visiting me. Now he only spoke to me on my birthday and didn't make much contact beyond a greeting and nothing more. I never held a grudge against him for this, but whenever I thought about him I felt a sense of nostalgia. Over the years I would occasionally check his social media to see what he was up to and stuff like that, just to get a sense of connection, though recently I've started to stop having that urge to check out what he's up to.

But recently, I found out (from my grandmother) that he had now settled back in my town, and was looking to have the same connection with me like years back. I, of course, felt a bit strange about it, as I was no longer used to having him around, which led to me feeling quite overwhelmed about what I should do, as my grandmother kept insisting that I should talk to him. My mom also told me that I should talk to him to ask for money, but she didn't insist nor did I feel obligated by her.

To cut to the chase:

My computer recently broke, and my phone has been malfunctioning lately, I need these things to find a job in the field I want (programming). My mom told me that I should ask my dad for money since he makes a pretty good living to buy big cars and all sorts of stuff. The thing is, I don't know exactly how to ask him. I've always had a problem asking people for things and I feel like this would be too much to ask.

My mom says that he owes me since he hasn't paid for anything for me in these years and because I'm his daughter. My girlfriend (19F) agrees with her and wants me to ask him since it would be a lot of help for me, but a part of me is afraid to ask my dad, I feel like he is going to stop talking to me again.

40,1g0eg4z,"AITA for refusing to spend time with my MIL, even though we live together?","I (19F) live with my fiancé (19M) and his mother (50F). We’ve lived together for over a year without major issues. I work two jobs, and my fiancé also works full-time, while my MIL stays home.

Recently, MIL has been frustrating us. I used to do all the cleaning and cooking when I worked part-time, but since starting my second job, I don’t have the time or energy. I still clean up after myself and prep meals for me and my partner, but the house is often in a mess—dirty dishes, kitchen utensils, and even a dirty knife on the floor when we return home.

MIL is aware I have OCD, which primarily affects my need for cleanliness and organization. Despite this, she recently cooked food I had set aside to take to my parents, despite me telling her not to touch it. When my partner spoke to her, she shouted, claiming she didn’t know, though I had informed her.

The next morning, after our discussion about not touching my things, she over-watered my plant, which didn’t need watering. She laughed and said, “Oh, it will probably die now,” which really upset me.

This behavior has been ongoing for months. Even after many conversations, nothing changes. I now avoid leaving our room to prevent further anxiety. I even keep items like drinking glasses, a kettle, and plants in our bedroom to avoid them being moved. I feel like a hermit in my own home.

My partner tries his best to support me, especially with my OCD. He helps clean and always accommodates my needs, but this is no way to live. We’re saving to buy a house, which will take time, and when we mention it, MIL pouts and says, “You’re not trying to leave me already, are you?” It feels like a guilt trip, but I don’t want to cause trouble.

In addition to these issues, the house is often filthy, especially the living room, where MIL chain-smokes. I can’t breathe in there, which is another reason I avoid spending time with her, aside from the lack of respect for my boundaries.

So, AITA for refusing to spend time with my MIL, even though we live together?

Edit: For clarification, I was asked to move in by her because she has disabilities that needed to be looked over. No one went into this blind as we had a big discussion about it before hand. As time went on, that is when the issues started to arise. I say “my own home” because she told me repeatedly to be more comfortable in the house as it was mine too. I am not trying to be entitled, It has just been in my head that it was a shared home from the start as MIL told me. All I simply wanted was for her to clean up her own dishes as my partner (her own son) had asked her before. I did not want to cause any trouble but I simple feel like my own boundaries have not been respected as I respect hers. 
She states that I do not spend time with her but I work full time and I spend my time cleaning and organising when I get home because MIL does not do her dishes. It’s a cycle that I cannot get out of. I get home every evening at 10pm to which she is already in bed and I have to clean and organise her medications.

42,1g0drda,WIBTAH if I purposely blow up my FIL’s life? ,"This is still very fresh, so I apologize if the writing is scrambled. 

My Husband and I just found out that in the past two months his father has stolen in total about $800 from his banking account, $400 of which was between September 28th- October 8th. He had been pulling the money out the day he got paid so we didn’t realize(before anyone asks how he had access, they opened up the account together when he was 14 and he didn’t expect his father to steal from him so he never made it a point to take his name off the account). October 8th he pulled out $200, and it was the first time we noticed, which is what caused me to look and find all the other transactions. He called his dad who made some bs response that he needed it for bills and would get it back into our account the next day(which didn’t happen). We hit a rough patch early September due to me being ordered on bed rest, we very quickly went from a two income household to a single income and we had to really scrape things together to make it work. 

We thought we were struggling, but it turned out my husbands father was just stealing from us. I can’t even imagine how vile of a human being you have to be in order to listen to your son and his 8 month pregnant wife talk about their financial struggles, all the while knowing you’re taking food from their mouths. I can’t even imagine the pain and anger my husband is dealing with right now. 

FIL and his wife got into a pretty massive argument last month because she had been sending him money for all the bills(she’s the breadwinner) and he had been going and spending it all on his “coin collection”, leaving their mortgage and electric bill unpaid. From the time that argument happened to current, he has taken about $600, so I can only assume that he’s doing it to save his face and marriage. 

There’s no way his wife has any idea about this, she has truly been a blessing to my husband and I throughout all of this, and she would rather starve herself than take money from her children(I had stayed with my in-laws a few weeks while we were moving and she refused to let me pay rent for the time I was there). She is already on her last leg with him. 

So, wibtah if we confront him with all the transactions in front of his wife? I want her to know exactly the kind of man she married. Part of me wonders if that’s too far, but the other part of me is honestly too angry to care. I just cannot believe a person could be so foul to his own flesh and blood. 

TLDR: my Husbands father had stolen about $800 from him in the past two months, and his wife has no idea. Wibtah if we confront him about it in front of his wife, even though it’ll likely be the nail in their marriage’s coffin? 



UPDATE: 

We’ve gotten a lot of very helpful responses and advice from you all, and I want to start off by thanking you guys for that. This has been a very tough situation for everyone involved, and sometimes getting 3rd party advice is the best way to go. We did take him off the account this morning, tomorrow morning we will be closing the account and opening a new one at a different bank per suggestions. 

I did take a redditors advice and before we had confronted him about everything I took MIL aside and explained what had happened, and as I guessed she had no idea. She was beyond angry and hurt. She has been sending him $750 a month to help with utilities, and he’s been spending it on god knows what. Their electricity shut off on the 8th, which is why he took the $200 from us. He then tried to excuse the other 6 transactions as an “accident”, then kept on switching from it being an accident to him having an “emergency” after nobody including his wife believed that any of them were accidents. 

His wife sent us the money he had taken out, which I don’t agree with. I don’t feel like it was her mistake to rectify, but I also understand she couldn’t consciously let us suffer because of him. I have no idea where they are going to go from here, but I now know this is not the first time he has done this, and he had taken out money from HER account 4 times before she lost it on him. In my personal opinion he has a serious problem, whether it be gambling or addiction, I do not think he would be spending over 1k a month on coins. But hopefully this situation can be a means of his wife finding out what has actually been going on, and her being able to take the proper steps to protect herself from his financial instability. 

We honestly have no idea where to go from here. The last thing I personally want is for MIL to be sucked into this more than she is, which makes distancing very difficult because no matter what she’s also going to take some of that downfall, even if it’s just supposed to be him. I am not sure where their relationship is after this though, she feels very betrayed. 

So that’s where we’re at. I want to thank everyone again for the amazing advice, and the validating responses. You’ve all helped out a lot more than you realize.

She has been sending him $750 a month to help with utilities, and he’s been spending it on god knows what. Their electricity shut off on the 8th, which is why he took the $200 from us. He then tried to excuse the other 6 transactions as an “accident”, then kept on switching from it being an accident to him having an “emergency” after nobody including his wife believed that any of them were accidents. 

His wife sent us the money he had taken out, which I don’t agree with. I don’t feel like it was her mistake to rectify, but I also understand she couldn’t consciously let us suffer because of him. I have no idea where they are going to go from here, but I now know this is not the first time he has done this, and he had taken out money from HER account 4 times before she lost it on him. In my personal opinion he has a serious problem, whether it be gambling or addiction, I do not think he would be spending over 1k a month on coins. But hopefully this situation can be a means of his wife finding out what has actually been going on, and her being able to take the proper steps to protect herself from his financial instability. 

We honestly have no idea where to go from here. The last thing I personally want is for MIL to be sucked into this more than she is, which makes distancing very difficult because no matter what she’s also going to take some of that downfall, even if it’s just supposed to be him. I am not sure where their relationship is after this though, she feels very betrayed. 

So that’s where we’re at. I want to thank everyone again for the amazing advice, and the validating responses. You’ve all helped out a lot more than you realize. ",0.0,-0.0007363969925791,0,1

A week out from the concert and my SO now lives with me and i said have we found anywhere for the concert. She said no and i said “well im not that keen to go now because we are both tight for money now since moving here and i said id only go if we get a place and it makes sense for me not to go if i dont enjoy the bands and itll cost me another $300+ just to get a place” she agreed and now the concert is tomorrow and we are arguing because she wants me to come with them now but i still dont feel comfortable and i see it as a waste of $300 to go and stay there watch bands i dont like and bob my head to and drive home in the morning.

44,1g0d896,AITA for exposing my friend’s crush ,"So my ex best friend had a crush on this girl at school named Sarah. 
To cut the story short, my friend decided to confess to Sarah but she unfortunately got rejected. 
The word about my friend’s confession spread quickly and everyone in our class knew. 

Fast forward three months after the incident, and we are talking in the pool about what happened and joking about it, but we all thought my friend got over Sarah. 
I said something along the lines of what my friend thought of Sarah at the time of the confession, and everyone started laughing. 

I didn’t think there was a problem at the time because we all thought that my friend didn’t like Sarah anymore. 
My friend had even said that she wasn’t really interested in Sarah anymore and started having a new crush on someone outside of school. 

However, after the chat at the pool, my friend confronted me, saying that she was annoyed that I told everyone. She said I should have kept it a secret and that she wouldn’t trust me anymore. 

Now we are no longer friends but I would still like to know.

45,1g0d7ao,AITA for calling the cops on my (maybe?) neighbors? ,"So I (20F) live in a house that was broken up into apartments. Attic is two apartments, ground floor is two, and tha basement is one. 

I live one of the attic apartments. The way it was modified was around the side of the house there is a door, when you open that door there's a rather steep and narrow stair case straight up to the two attic apartments. So the only possible neighbor I risk running into on the inside of the building would be that second attic apartment. 

When I first moved in 8 months ago the person across the hall was just at the tail end of the eviction process and left all of his stuff and his cat. So someone took the cat and the whole apartment had to be gutted because that place was one step away from being a biohazard. 

So for as long as I've lived here, that apartment has been empty. 

Around 9pm I was chilling with my boyfriend when I thought I heard talking in the hallway, a thick stench of cigarettes wafting through the door. I threw on a shirt and peeked my head out the door to see a man and a woman messing with the door to the other apartment. 

I initially apologized and they just said they were trying to get into the apartment. It was locked and they didn't have a key. 

I closed the door and told my boyfriend about it and then called my landlord, because I never saw anyone go in and finish actually fix that apartment since I moved here. 

I asked if anyone was living there or moving in and she said absolutely not and to call the police. 

As I hung up with her my boyfriend and I heard the door of the other apartment pop open. 

I called the police to tell them there were people possibly trespassing ans explained the whole situation. 

As I say that the door slams and the bolted down the stairs and ran to a truck parked around the back. My boyfriend was able to get photos of the truck and we shared it with the police who tracked down the couple. 

The weird part was they said they were tenants and called the homeowner on the spot for them, a man (my landlord is a woman). 

So I called my landlord back confused, and she was just as confused as I was. She did co-own the property with a man, but it was agreed upon that she handled contracts, finances, and moving people in while he handled maintenance and up keep of the property. She also said that in the 20 years she's worked with him he's never gone behind her back to move tenants in. So she also talked to the cop and low and behold the people had the right name and person who co-owns the house, so he just hadn't told her.

Last year I said I wasn’t going to do anything but my favorite artist had a concert+meet & greet on my birthday and i took my friend A(22M) with me cause he liked her as well and i didn’t want to go alone. 

I guess he took that as me changing my mind for some reason? so this year he’s been asking me what i want to do and originally i said a house party but that’s not going to work so i elected to my og plan of nothing. apparently that’s not what he wanted to hear, so he’s been pestering me to change my mind by saying things like “spending your birthday alone is CRAZYYY” or “you don’t really want to spend it by yourself” or “i’d be a bad friend if i let you spend my birthday alone.” and usually when he does this i just ask him to drop it, but tonight he’d been annoying all night and i was fed up. 

i very firmly told him to stop asking me about my birthday and it’s pissing me off. i already told him nicely to stop asking several times prior. he immediately shut me down and called me rude and that i shouldn’t talk to him like a child because it’s disrespectful. that he was simply trying to be a good friend a push me towards a good time and i shouldn’t make him feel guilty for wanting to do that. 

i told him that i don’t want a party. i don’t want to be celebrated. i want to be ALONE. so him pushing me towards something i’ve repeatedly told him i DONT WANT is obviously going to piss me off. we got into a whole fight where he basically guilt tripped me saying that if i don’t explain why i don’t want to have a party, my friends are going to be confused and will feel like bad friends if they don’t celebrate me. (which is false, i’ve told my other friends i don’t want to celebrate without trauma dumping and while they may not agree with it, they’re respecting my decision.) so i told him “a real friend would back me in whatever i wanted to do because it’s MY birthday” and i guess that upset him cause he shut down the conversation saying he was tired and “didn’t want to read paragraphs about how he’s a shitty person”

Along with this decision, i also decided to move out of state to go live with my dad and stepmom for a while. There are multiple reasons for my decision but I’ll list the main ones here: my mom is a high functioning alcoholic who is verbally and emotionally abusive. She has threatened to kick me out several times over the past 2 months i’ve been in school and since i turned 18 frankly. The environment i live in is toxic and has had a negative impact on my mental health. Anyways, I made the decision to move and that made a whole argument start.

51,1g0bysl,AITA for telling my kids anything I say is up for debate ,"My ex and I have 2 kids, 7m and 5f. We have very different parenting styles. He’s very authoritative and, while I wouldn’t call myself permissive, I try to give the kids as much control in their day to day lives as possible. 

Something new that I’ve been trying with the kids is that I told them nearly all of my decisions are up for debate; meaning if they could understand my reasoning for my decision but come up with a respectful well thought out compromise or argument, I may change my mind.  

An example of this happened the other day. My son asked for an icee and I said no. He asked why and I told him it had too much sugar and I didn’t want to spend my money on it. He went to his room and came back 10 minutes later asking if I could take him to get an icee if he gets 100% on his practice spelling test, buys the icee with his own money, and skips dessert for the next 2 nights. I decided that was a fair agreement that addressed my concerns and was presented in a respectful manner, he completed his end of the bargain with his spelling test and getting the money out of his bank, and he got an icee. The next day he asked for dessert but accepted it when I reminded him that he said 2 days without dessert in exchange for the icee. 

My ex hates that I’m doing this. Apparently the kids ask why he makes every decision and try to come to an agreement with him for everything.

He’s very authoritative and, while I wouldn’t call myself permissive, I try to give the kids as much control in their day to day lives as possible. 

Something new that I’ve been trying with the kids is that I told them nearly all of my decisions are up for debate; meaning if they could understand my reasoning for my decision but come up with a respectful well thought out compromise or argument, I may change my mind.  

An example of this happened the other day. My son asked for an icee and I said no. He asked why and I told him it had too much sugar and I didn’t want to spend my money on it. He went to his room and came back 10 minutes later asking if I could take him to get an icee if he gets 100% on his practice spelling test, buys the icee with his own money, and skips dessert for the next 2 nights. I decided that was a fair agreement that addressed my concerns and was presented in a respectful manner, he completed his end of the bargain with his spelling test and getting the money out of his bank, and he got an icee. The next day he asked for dessert but accepted it when I reminded him that he said 2 days without dessert in exchange for the icee. 

My ex hates that I’m doing this. Apparently the kids ask why he makes every decision and try to come to an agreement with him for everything. He told me to stop and that I’m encouraging the kids to try to undermine his parenting but I’m trying to teach them critical thinking and problem solving skills and to question/challenge authority.

52,1g0bu2c,AITA for cancelling my friends trip?,"I’m part of a friend group of 8, and we planned a trip to Korea in December as a graduation celebration, especially since two of us will be enlisting to the army soon. We’ve been looking forward to this as a once-in-a-lifetime trip together, so we want everything to be perfect.

We booked our air tickets around February, however as the months went by, tensions have been escalating with one friend in particular (let’s call him Ray). He constantly complains about money spent on the trip (air ticket and accommodation) which made everyone annoyed and frustrated at him. Even during our regular meetups for meals, he’d kick up a fuss over small things, like a discrepancy as small as $5 in the bill. This kind of behavior frustrated everyone.

What made things worse was when we discovered Ray had been badmouthing another member of the group to his other friends. One of our friends happened to hear what he’d been saying, and it became a major point of tension between us all.

At first, we tried to cut Ray some slack, thinking maybe he was going through something personal that he hadn’t shared with us. We gave him the benefit of the doubt and even tried asking him subtly if everything was okay. But Ray never opened up, and his behavior only worsened. Over the months, Ray became increasingly unpleasant, and our group grew hesitant about having him join us on the trip.

We knew we couldn’t ignore the issue any longer, so we decided to confront him and be honest about our feelings. We hoped he’d choose to cancel his flight on his own—after all, why go on a trip with people who don’t want you there? During the conversation, we explained how his constant complaints and negative attitude had impacted the group, and how the tension between him and the other group member would make things uncomfortable for everyone.

Ray didn’t take it well at first. He insisted on coming and said we were overreacting, claiming that he didn’t mean anything serious by his complaints or the things he’d said. But we stood our ground, and eventually, we suggested that if he really wanted to come, he would have to book his own accommodation. We even offered to reimburse him for his flight and the accommodation he had already paid for if he canceled the trip.

After a week of back-and-forth, Ray finally decided to cancel his flight. Now, I’m wondering, AITA for forcing him into a corner and threatening him with the fact that he would have no place to stay?

I know we could’ve addressed this sooner instead of letting his hopes build, but he was a decent friend before, and at the time, his behavior was more bearable. We wanted this trip to be perfect, and we felt his presence would ruin it, not just for us but for him as well, since he’d be isolated with no one to talk to. Offering to pay for his ticket and accommodation was our way of apologizing for wasting his time and disappointing him.

53,1g0bp22,AITA for ignoring someone ,"Me and my online friend have been pretty close, and lately they felt distance. By that I mean when I invited to hang out they rather play by themselves, they are already hanging out with people already and they are people I don’t like, etc. Which I understand we need breaks from people and all that, but it seemed like it was just me lately. 

So I start hanging with in a server where we have mutual friends. They message and said something like no invite. I was like it’s an open server so they could come in and hang out if they wanted to. They were at work so they couldn’t but asked if I wanted to hang out on later in the week, I said sure and waited till the day we agreed upon. No message, we talked back that day so it’s not like they forgot about me. But I check later and realize they are playing with a friend we both share and one of the people I don’t like. I was a bit surprised but I was like oh they are just playing a game with them and ask me later if I am still up to hang out. 

That did not happen, the next day came and went they didn’t message all day. Feeling a bit mad I reply to the hangout text and wait. They sent me a half-ass reply and about how their sleep schedule is messed up and how the show we are watching is almost over and said sorry at the end. I decided to call them out how they hanged out with other people last night and didn’t text me afterwards at all, also how their sleep schedule messed up is nothing to do with hanging out. They start back peddling a bit, and said they are an asshole and ask if I wanted to hang out then. I told them no and started to ignore them. They started to message me, sending some memes or TikToks then deleting them, and said that they would give me space. They did all that in the span of a day. The next day, they message me again asking if we are still friends so they can stop obsessing over this.

54,1g0bolk,AITA for reporting my car stolen after my “friend” stole it?,"Couple of my friends came over to my house to hang out because my parents went out of town for the week. I’m the only one in the group with a license and a car and live in the suburbs while everyone else lived in the inner city. One of my friends brought some pretty strong edibles and I was literally out for four days straight, think it was like 500 mg of THC and I was tripping balls. While high, one of them was asking me to drive him to McDonald’s or whatever and I told him to fuck off because I was high as fuck. 

While I was high, I saw him going through my pockets and taking my keys, I was too high to do anything about it and slowly said “Do…n…t ta….ke my ca…r” he just ignored me and I heard my car drive off. I went back into my high and forgot about it for few hours. I woke up from a weird dream and realized my car was gone. 

The person that stole my car has no license and asked me before if he could practice on my car. I always refused because I only had a novice license and literally couldn’t by law, have him behind the wheel of my car. I first called him and told him that he was a dick and bring my car back, he said “relax, I’m just practicing I’ll be back soon”. I don’t know about you, but I hate people who have zero respect for other people’s property. So instead of just letting it go, I called the cops and reported my car stolen and gave them my “friend’s” information. 

A police officer came over to my house and I told him the whole story, the officer and I waited for him to come back. Rest of my buddies were still high, so I sent them to my bedroom. About two hours later the dipshit thief comes back with my car. When he came back the officer gave him an earful and arrests him motor vehicle theft. He now has a criminal record and will probably get prison time. AITA?

I didn't really appreciate that so i told her to just not say anything if she was being negative. so today she was talking about how the student news at my school was getting an add and that it was 9% of the video. the conversation went something like this (the bold is me, the italics is her)  **""makes sense for normal tv""** *""the difference is tv is longer + paid for lol""* \*\*\*""\*\*\***idc""** then she told me she didn't think i realized how I came off.

I told her I did, then brought up the issue from two days ago where she said the thing about the character i liked. she made the excuse that it was from two days ago and also she wasn't entirely shutting down a conversation (which in my opinion DID because she was being rude about something i was passionate about.) she just wanted to have 'discussions' is what she calls them. i didn't want a debate/discussion about why my character is good and not boring and doesn't deserve hate. i just wanted to celebrate that he was being released after months of waiting. i can't tell if i am an asshole here or not.

EDIT: CANNOT believe I left out an important detail (im not adding this to clear my name) but she's had a past of commenting on most things i find nice and stuff and just trying to debate me and or just not like the things i like. my friend likes having very deep and heavy conversations about media and I'm just not the person to do it with her.

I recently moved and I got a job as a Document Coordinator. It's a job that I had to relearn since I had a similar one years prior. The whole building has multiple departments but we have our own mini office. 

I got hired in an office with 4 other employee's (Fake names/ estimated ages) Korra (45F), Aussie (35F), and Sierra (28F) 
These people have worked at this company for quite some time with loads of things in common.

Since I have been working here, I have had 3 people UNPROMPTED come up to me while on mail walk and ask me something along the lines of, ""Why are they talking to you this way"", ""Don't you think their tone when they talk to you is kind of.. snooby?"" (Not my words- I'd personally say they sometimes have a more... annoyed tone?) 

Recently it's been getting alot worse.
I was accidentally sent a screenshot of my own text with the label ""wtf"" because Aussie and Sierra were texting each other ABOUT something I had asked. 
It was resolved the next day with the excuse that, ""Oh well I've been stressed and we were confused on your question."" Etc.. but like... I didn't quite honestly believe that. I grew up in a superficial town where you couldn't quite tell just anyone anything without gossip and whispers down the street. 

Aussie sometimes flat out ignores me in casual talk or work questions. An example from 2 days ago was when I was mid sentence with a work question that I know she was engaging with (I always get the attention of the other person before saying anything normally)
And mid sentence she cuts me off, turns towards Sierra and starts a new convo with her, not even answering the question I was asking. 

Aussie will hop into the conversation with the other two but if I have anything to say, she almost slows/ stops conversing.
When she does respond, sometimes it can come off as kind of rude in a way. (I'd like to add that this is just how I see it from MY OWN PERSPECTIVE because maybe I'm misinterpreting but Aussie has an entirely different tone talking to me vs talking to Korra or Sierra) 

Where I may be the AH is that I finally brought this up with my boss, Korra, today. 
I told her how this is effecting me and how it is kind of getting way too much. She said we can all have a chat together about it which I'm terrified will make it worse.
I feel like the AH because sometimes they can be nice. Sierra is alot nicer (to my face at least...) And will help out in office alot more than Aussie will.

I'm not saying ""Everyone should love me and think I'm cool at all times ever"" and I'm not saying I want/ expect ""Work besides forever bffs omg!!""

I (21 NB) am DIAGNOSED with Adhd/ autism. Social cues and Social norms and whatnot are NOT my strongsuit.

I recently moved and I got a job as a Document Coordinator. It's a job that I had to relearn since I had a similar one years prior. The whole building has multiple departments but we have our own mini office. 

I got hired in an office with 4 other employee's (Fake names/ estimated ages) Korra (45F), Aussie (35F), and Sierra (28F) 
These people have worked at this company for quite some time with loads of things in common.

Since I have been working here, I have had 3 people UNPROMPTED come up to me while on mail walk and ask me something along the lines of, ""Why are they talking to you this way"", ""Don't you think their tone when they talk to you is kind of.. snooby?"" (Not my words- I'd personally say they sometimes have a more... annoyed tone?)

64,1g09f4h,AITA for telling my best friend he is being inconsiderate for scheduling his wedding over NBA All-Star Weekend?,"I (32M) am in a group of eight male best friends. We met in college, and we have done an amazing job of maintaining our relationship as a really tight knit group. 

One of the guys in our group has worked for the NBA for the last decade, and he runs the All-Star Weekend. Every year he brings our entire group to NBA All-Star Weekend where we get incredibly special treatment. 

Our whole group relishes this weekend, but it’s most important to our friend who works for the NBA. This is his dream job, and he absolutely loves sharing the weekend with all of us. 

Getting to experience all of the All-Star events is truly a blast, but what is more important is getting our group of eight best friends together. All-Star Weekend is the only time our entire group gets together, and we look forward to it all year round. 

We have done this trip every year for the last 10 years, and we’ve each booked the weekend off for the indefinite future. It’s basically the most important weekend of the year for our collective friendship. 

With only four months' notice, one of our best friends sent a text to our group last week to let us know that he was booking his wedding over NBA All-Star Weekend. He told us that it was the only date that worked for his wedding, and he could not have the wedding on any other day. The other seven of us would be his groomsmen. 

I called my friend and told him that I thought it was inconsiderate that he was having his wedding on All-Star Weekend. I told him that I did not care that we were going to miss All-Star Weekend this year because obviously I was thrilled to celebrate his wedding. 

However, I told him that I thought it was an inconsiderate decision because it means his wedding anniversary will always be right around the event. As such, we will likely lose him for the guy’s trip forever. 

He was very angry with me, saying that I am an AH for comparing his wedding to All-Star Weekend. I can understand that because I know that planning a wedding is challenging and he has to manage needs from his fiancée and their families. But on the other hand he has the ability to pick any weekend he wants, and we cannot control when All-Star Weekend is scheduled. 

Now he expects me to apologize to him for insinuating that his wedding is less important than NBA All-Star Weekend. I can understand why he feels this way, but that is not what I meant. 

I meant that I thought he could be flexible to maintain our annual guy’s trip by scheduling his wedding at any other time. I still think he should try to move the wedding. So… AITA?

67,1g08vz9,WIBTA If I don't pay for my stepfather's ticketa to visit me?,"AM I THE ASSHOLE NOT TO BUY TICKETS FOR MY STEPFATHER TO COME VISIT ME?

First I'd like to warn you guys that english isn't my first language, so it may be poorly written.

Well, let's start:

I'm (F28) brazilian, but I live in Japan with my husband (M26). My entire family still lives in Brazil, and they're not rich or anything, mostly middle class I think... Adding it for some context.

We came here to work and save money and I just found out I'm pregnant! I'm very very happy about it, as we always wanted to have a big family.

Now I'm saving some money so I can invite my mom (F51), my dad (M60) and my stepmom (F62) to come visit and help with the baby after labor. I pretend to pay for the 3 of them. However, after I told my mom I refused to pay for my stepfather's (M53) ticket, seh got really sad and said whe wasn't coming. She said she 'can't leave him alone for 2 months, he can't deal with everything alone' (mind you they live in a small house on the middle of nowhere, but he can drive and as an adult man should be able to take a little care of the house and the cat). 

You guys must be wondering why I will not pay for him, well... when I was a teenager he used to offend me, call me ugly, freak and dumb, forbidden me from having house keys (he said I'd lost it and then random people would follow me and enter the house) and I ended up locked outside many time, he said I (13 yo at the time) was makig strategies so and creating situations to separate him and my mom, said I was a burden and kicked me out 'his house' (which my mom helped paying for) and I had to go live with my grandma.

During this time my mom would only see me once a week and spent all her free days with him. I know she has her flaws and made choices, but she said sorry and we're trying to rebuild this relationship, also because I grew to see how abusive, narcissistic and selfish he is and how it affects her. He even brainwashed her into becoming an right-wingish Karen like person sometimes... (She used to be inteligent and smart, but he trapped her far from society now)

Now, coming back to present times. Me and my mom have been trying to bond again for the last few years and we can have good times together, and as I said, I'm polite around my stepfather.

I'm (F28) brazilian, but I live in Japan with my husband (M26). My entire family still lives in Brazil, and they're not rich or anything, mostly middle class I think... Adding it for some context.

We came here to work and save money and I just found out I'm pregnant! I'm very very happy about it, as we always wanted to have a big family.

Now I'm saving some money so I can invite my mom (F51), my dad (M60) and my stepmom (F62) to come visit and help with the baby after labor. I pretend to pay for the 3 of them. However, after I told my mom I refused to pay for my stepfather's (M53) ticket, seh got really sad and said whe wasn't coming. She said she 'can't leave him alone for 2 months, he can't deal with everything alone' (mind you they live in a small house on the middle of nowhere, but he can drive and as an adult man should be able to take a little care of the house and the cat). 

You guys must be wondering why I will not pay for him, well... when I was a teenager he used to offend me, call me ugly, freak and dumb, forbidden me from having house keys (he said I'd lost it and then random people would follow me and enter the house) and I ended up locked outside many time, he said I (13 yo at the time) was makig strategies so and creating situations to separate him and my mom, said I was a burden and kicked me out 'his house' (which my mom helped paying for) and I had to go live with my grandma.

During this time my mom would only see me once a week and spent all her free days with him. I know she has her flaws and made choices, but she said sorry and we're trying to rebuild this relationship, also because I grew to see how abusive, narcissistic and selfish he is and how it affects her. He even brainwashed her into becoming an right-wingish Karen like person sometimes... (She used to be inteligent and smart, but he trapped her far from society now)

Now, coming back to present times. Me and my mom have been trying to bond again for the last few years and we can have good times together, and as I said, I'm polite around my stepfather. Also, my dad means the whole world to me and I would need 9394 pages",0.0,0.0188200529664754,0,1
68,1g08dcx,AITA for arguing with my parents,"AITA for arguing with my parents? 

Context: I am 18, my mother is religious and Mexican. My dad is white and temperamental.

My pet hamster dies and the next morning I decide to bury it. My mother says alright, I can go bury him in the backyard while I clean the cage. I begin crying of course I saw the hamster as a family member, and come inside after burying him. 

My mother says,”It is annoying to have to clean up his cage, I shouldn’t be doing this.” I thought,”Really? You’re gonna say that after he died and right after I barely buried him?” I don’t say anything. 

Afterwards my father returns from grocery shopping and asks if something happened between me and my mother. I say,” no? Of course not”. He gets upset and says “You don’t have to be sarcastic about it”. I begin crying because again, the family pet just died, and my father says,”Okay, don’t bother me about it. Go do what you need to do”. 

Later on we have dinner, and my sister tells me to grab my food. I mistake my brother’s food for my own and she says with a tone,”No, YOUR FOOD.” I say “ALRIGHT” back with the same tone and my mother says,”You two are not enemies you’re sisters, act like it”. My father says to me,”Again, why are you being sarcastic?” I say I was only defending myself

We begin arguing and my father eventually says,”It’s just a fcking mascot, why are you so sad about it?!” I say “I was attached to it!” My mother agrees with my father, she says I should be that sad when my parents die, not a small rat. 

Later on in the argument I tell my mother,”Why would you say you’re bothered to clean up the cage right after I buried him? That’s insensitive and horrible timing to say that. For someone so religious, you sure don’t care about small life”. 


My mother defends herself by saying,”No, I’m religious for the exact opposite! I am a broken sinner who goes to church because I need God. I know that animals don’t have souls because they don’t have rational thought like we do! I am happy the hamster died because he was suffering, and I could care less that he died because it was an animal with no soul! Why do you care about it?! You know, you haven’t matured at all”.

I start defending myself too saying,”Of course I’ve matured you just don’t see it. I’ve matured since I’ve gotten bullied as a kid.” My mother interrupts me by yelling,”You always bring that up! You being bullied! Every discussion! You have not matured and continue to bring it up!” 

I don’t bring it up, maybe every other month or so, once. It’s not a day to day occurrence, or I don’t constantly sob about it like a wimp. I say,” No no, it’s to prove my point, that I have matured. I know how to handle myself”. 

So am I the asshole for being upset about the family pet dying? For bringing that point up to my mother?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for arguing with my parents AITA for arguing with my parents?

69,1g082bi,"AITA for surprising my wife with food she mentioned wanting, but not getting exactly what she expected?","My wife has mentioned in the past that she wanted to try the Krabby Patty burger and a pineapple Frosty from Wendy's. On my way home from work, I decided to surprise her. I picked up a Krabby Patty burger, a chicken sandwich for myself, and two pineapple Frostys. I knew she was about an hour away, so I told her I had a surprise waiting for her when she got home.

To keep the food fresh, I put her burger in the fridge and the Frosty in the freezer. I even ordered the burger without lettuce, thinking I could avoid it getting soggy, and we have lettuce at home that we could add fresh.

When she got home, she was excited about the Frosty and asked, ""Is there a Krabby Patty burger too?"" I told her to check the fridge, and that’s when things went downhill. She got upset because the burger was cold and I didn’t get fries. She said that real ""justice"" would have been me waiting for her to come home so we could both get fresh food together, or at least putting my food in the fridge too, so we’d both be eating cold food.

She accused me of always expecting grand thanks for doing gestures that aren’t as big as I think they are and said I didn’t listen to her, since she wanted the full meal, not just the burger and Frosty. She also said she’s not going to pretend to be grateful for something that wasn’t what she asked for.

I was just trying to do something nice, and now I feel like my gesture was totally unappreciated. AITA?


Update: so we talked about it and I explained that I didn't have a problem if she would have said, I appreciate the gesture but I would have liked to get it together or if we would have waited until she was home.

 I told her I understood why she was upset and we both agreed that there was a better way to talk about it. 

She took a bite just now and said ""this is just a Dave's single with fancy sauce,"" so she doesn't even want it anymore hot or cold.

71,1g07nc8,AITA for calling out my friend after he did something generally considered rude?,"Additional context going back about two months: we were playing games and at some point hit each other with cars while playing the aforementioned video game, we spoke for the first time since then at an event that I will not mention here to maintain anonymity.

I felt like he was holding it above my head, but I don’t know to what end. AITA?

Here’s a form of transcript of our text conversation this morning:

Just so you know dude, it’s generally a dick move to inform someone of plans they aren’t invited to. 

I might invite you. I’m still planning it but
(Mutual friend) does not like how you cussing. 

Again, tell him to grow a metaphorical pair and come to me about it. If he has a problem, he can speak to me directly. 

Maybe you can try and respect people sometimes too. 

Don’t try and use the fact that I think I’m a dickhead against me, I’m not the asshole here. You are the asshole in this context, and I am the one pointing it out. best case scenario it feels like you’re holding it above my head. Worst case you just told me about plans you never planned to invite me to just out of spite, and I’m kinda leaning towards the latter. 

I just want you to now just forget everything I said about friends thing I think it is just a (event group) friend thing would more work out then just being friends out of (event).

My brother in Christ you are the asshole here, you don’t inform people about plans they aren’t invited to unless asked if you’re busy that day/time and then expect them to cave and call themselves the asshole

72,1g07mma,AITA for relocating without telling my parents and siblings and refusing to give my brother a house down payment?,"I (33f) am relocating out of my home state in 2 weeks. 

I went no contact with my parents and siblings nearly 4 years ago shortly after I purchased my current home. My parents are very blue collar and grew up with only brothers. My brother is the only boy, the baby, autistic, and named his only son after my brother who passed away. He gets everything. My sister is very masculine, blue collar, lesbian. I’m white collar, educated and very girly. 

My entire life I’ve always been the outsider and they made sure I knew that, harshly. It was worse whenever I succeeded in life. No contact with them was the best thing I could’ve ever done for my mental health and I’ll never go back unless they’re all in intensive therapy. 

Fast forward to this week they found out I’m relocating out of state and selling my home. Naturally, the horrific texts have rolled through and are extra special. They know what I bought it for and a simple search they will know what I’m selling for. They’re “hurt” I didn’t tell them and want the money they gifted me to get my home to give my brother. 

I refuse to give them any access to my life. They gifted my sister her down payment and me but unable to for my brother. Of course they think I’m an AH and a few more nice choice words. My cousin and uncle say I should give the money because it’s only 1/3 of my proceeds. I refuse. They gave MY savings account to him that I had been building for years. 

But, I’m second guessing my decision to not tell them where I’m going or giving them the money back. I’m still their daughter and they want to know my whereabouts. My brother has a 3 yr old son and 1 year old daughter. It’s expensive where we are and I want the kids to have stability. So, Am I TAH?

EDIT TO ANSWER COMMON QUESTIONS: I am no contact. I do not initiate or engage with them at all. I don’t have them blocked due to they will text me about important family updates like my uncle died, or was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. (I have 11) Also for evidence if needed for an injunction of harassment or something else which has been the case in 2021. 

They found out through a family member who has early Alzheimer’s. I will not go no contact or scold someone with a horrible disease over this. 

The savings account was a conservator account from when my brother and I got a settlement as babies. We both needed to be 18 and a court order to withdraw but could add. I took advantage of it by adding birthday and chore money. My mom managed to get the court order for both when my brother turned 18, I was 19 and the bank gave her the funds. She gave it to my brother. I’ve no idea why she did and can only guess.

Okay.
So I’ve lived here now for 3 years.. they’ve lived here about 6. We share a drive and theirs sits infront of my front door.

Let me start by saying I offer this woman help with the girls, the ability to use my skip when we have renovations and take their bins in and out when they’re on holiday. Cause I’m nice. I won’t be any more.
I’ve asked them to stop their two younger girls from walking on my gravel, why? One because I’m sick of having to relay it and set the back to look nice and two, because it’s simply impolite. It went ignored.
So yesterday I put my bins on the line between my property and theirs. The neighbours misses messaged me at ten at night saying if I don’t move them I’ll be billed for any damage due to current weather to their DLA car…. And it’ll all be on camera. Now okay, I was being petty with the bins… so I admitted that and said “I’ll move them if you make the girls stop. Whilst I’ve got you though” I’ve been parking on the road for the past three months as my partners car is way more expensive than mine and your kids keep dinging it. So can you ask them to be mindful when they open doors. Got told I was lying 🤥 and then I informed her that their new dog keeps bulldozing itself into out fence (it’s now fooked) and scaring our 2 year old from playing out there, can she fix that? She said she knew nothing about it (she does cause she’s installed bird feeders in the sections with gaps 😂🥱) and told me I’m point scoring? I said no there’s just no way to approach you and when I do I’m “lying”. I’ve since set up a camera on the front and back facing mostly their way since I “lie” to prove that actually you just need to get some manners.
She said she will talk to my fella.. he messaged her 17 hours ago and no reply, I asked if she got it 6 hours ago and she blanked my message. What do I do now? Just had a new kitchen installed by the landlady so didn’t really wanna move and leave her in the red, but these dickheads next door have boiled my piss. I even threw a lol doll campervan my mum got for them cause she knows I like to give the girls shit in the bin instead of offering it to them like I normally would 😂😡 what would you do? Cause I’m like either gonna shit in a bag and light it then ring the door bell.

76,1g06g53,AITA for this stupid impulsive mistake I made?,"For a preface, I (ftm19) was in a toxic relationship with a sociopath last year and developed a lot of identity and trauma from it. She made me think things that weren’t normal were normal for instance she made me believe that most relationships were open sex relationships (she cheated on me twice with my best friend… no longer my best friend. They are also now dating which sucks ass.) I made a new friend (m19) a few weeks ago and we’ve been really close. I have impulsivity issues and for whatever stupid reason I asked him if he would be interested in and if his long distance boyfriend (m19) would be okay with us hooking up as a casual friend thing. He was interested and asked his long distance boyfriend and his boyfriend got really mad at him. Especially because his boyfriend is really insecure and was worried that I was making my friend happier than he was. His boyfriend told him that he can’t be friends with me anymore. My friend and I spoke, I apologized about asking him because I know I was incredibly stupid and impulsive asking something like that. He forgives me. He really wants to be friends, as do I. It’s his boyfriend that won’t let him.

But life happened, we had two sons, Noel (20M) and Will (17M) young and those big dreams faded. Steven's stuck teaching English at the local comp, living on an estate. Now, I love Steven, but everyday, he comes home angrier, more frustrated and lately, he's been taking it all out on Will.

Will's always been his own person. Loud, cocky and arrogant. Dressed in nowt but adidas ane band tshirts, mouthing off about football or music, winding everyone up. He's not what Steven wanted him to be. Back when Will was a baby, Steven was obsessed with the idea that he'd be something special, but as Will's grown up into this unapologetic working-class lad, Steven can't handle it. Meanwhile, Noel's always been quiet, thoughtful, Steven adores him. He gets along with Noel because Noel doesn't challenge him, doesn't remind him of everything he resents. But Will? He's like a walking reminder of what Steven didn't want his life to be.

78,1g06415,AITA for not attending my best friend's wedding? ,"I (35f) have known my best friend (34f) since she was born (our parents were friends in college). As long as I can remember, we've always been inseparable. We went to different high schools and then different states for college and yet we have remained closer than ever. This bond grew especially because my parents died when I was 18 and since then her parents took it upon themselves to act as my family, inviting me over for the holidays, sending me care packages, etc. And so, she became the closest thing I have to a sibling.

A few weeks ago, my best friend (let's call her Anya), her fiancé, and I visited our hometown where we stayed with Anya's parents for a few days to plan her wedding. It was all going well until we got to the guest list. The guest list had pretty much been finalized at this point but it was my first time seeing it. I noticed that my name didn't have a plus one and that my wife's name wasn't on the list at all. I assumed that it must have been a mistake so I asked Anya about it casually in front of everyone. As soon as I asked, she got all tense and looked at her fiancé and parents weirdly. At this point, it was clear to me that there was something going on that I didn't know about. I asked her what was going on and Anya cleared her throat awkwardly before telling me that the reason my wife wasn't on the list was because she wasn't invited. 

I was shocked. Anya and my wife aren't particularly close but they have always been friendly with each other and never had bad things to say about the other person. I asked her why, thinking it might have been a financial issue. She again looked around awkwardly before eventually telling me the truth. She was afraid that having my wife at her wedding and us being seen as an openly queer couple would take attention away from her on her big day. 

I feel it is important to mention at this point that Anya and I are both South Asian and Anya's wedding is going to take place in India (although we live in the US) so that all her relatives and parents' friends are able to attend. At such a traditional event, it would indeed be an uncommon sight to see an openly queer couple together and honestly, it likely would take some of the attention off of Anya on her wedding day. Knowing that, I can't really blame Anya for wanting one day where the focus is solely on her and her soon to be husband. 

However, I also don't think I can attend an event where my partner isn't welcome, regardless of the reason. My wife is the most important person in the world to me and although I respect Anya's decision, I can't bring myself to go to another country and to the wedding without my wife. 

Anya, her parents, and our family friends are all extremely hurt by this decision and are telling me that I am being selfish.

I reached my breaking point and finally stood up for myself, but now she's trying to make me out to be the bad guy. Can you believe that?",0.0,0.05483213812112808,0,1

87,1g0ve93,WIBTA for refusing to rehome my dog even though my roommates are complaining?,"I (22F) live with my boyfriend (23M) and another couple (both 22). We all moved in together at the same time, and the woman in the couple is a high school friend. They already had a cat, and after settling in, I decided to adopt a dog. I’ve struggled with depression, anxiety, panic attacks, and ADD, and I’ve found that living with a dog helps. Plus, I’m planning to move abroad in a year and wanted a familiar companion.

Before getting the dog, I asked my roommates how they felt, and they were fine with it since they already had a cat, and their cat liked dogs. I adopted a mix-breed dog, and I’ve worked hard to potty train him (no accidents for three months). I also invested in professional training, and he’s doing advanced obedience classes.

The main issue is my dog has separation anxiety. When we’re at work for 8 hours, he used to cry, bark, throw up, and even escape his crate. To help, I walked him in the mornings, did light training, and hired a dog walker. That became too expensive, so I started leaving him in my room with a chew toy. This reduced some behaviors, but my roommates still complained about his whining.

I eventually sent him to a $2,000 board-and-train program. Since returning, he no longer cries, whines, or escapes his crate, and he’s no longer destructive. However, he still barks once every 2-10 minutes for about four hours. I’ve been working with the trainer, but my roommates don’t think the progress is enough. They’ve asked me to rehome him, saying it’s unfair he’s crated for 8 hours and that the barking is disruptive.

My dog came from a shelter, and I’ve done everything I can to give him a better life. He gets daily park visits, plenty of exercise, vet visits, etc. He comes on trips and hikes with me and socializes with my mom’s dog. He’s not perfect, but he’s made progress, and I don’t think rehoming is the answer.

I also feel entitled to keeping him due to other roommate issues. I’ve spent over $1,100 on shared house items, and they’ve never contributed or helped with chores. They clogged our shower drain, and my boyfriend paid for the plumber. The woman sometimes flirts with my boyfriend or tries to villainize me, which is uncomfortable. When they mention dog issues, they say, “You need to take care of it,” even though I’m at work (its usually at 7am). When I mentioned contacting the trainer or rehoming, the woman immediately latched onto rehoming, offering to help find him a new home, which felt insensitive.

I’ve been quiet about these frustrations because they’ve been patient while my dog’s in training, but I feel like I deserve to keep him after everything I’ve handled. I don’t think rehoming is the right solution.

88,1g0v93q,AITA for scolding my best friend after his dad threw out my gym equipment,"2 years ago I moved in w/ my gf and couldn't fit my gym equipment in my new apt (\~$1200 worth of gear - a bench, a squat-rack, 3 barbells and about 500 lbs of plates.) I asked my best friend (32 yo who lives at home w/ his parents) to hold on to it since he works out at home. He only had a bench and some dumbbells so i figured he could make good use of my equipment. The agreement was always that I would get it back when I moved to a new spot but that he could keep it in the meantime.... I never said the equipment was his and I've made references throughout the past two years about ""my weights"".

I recently moved and now have a backyard. I asked him for the equipment and he says his dad threw it away. I see this friend at least every other week but we text almost daily and he never mentioned that his dad would be throwing out my stuff. When I found out, I went off on him and I'm now very tempted to cut him out of my life. He lives a very carefree life (no bills no major responsibilities) so I can understand why he might not know the monetary value of the gym equipment. But this kinda thing happens often and I'm just a little fed up with the dgaf attitude and just how inconsiderate he was by not letting me know. I've already been questioning our friendship because I often feel like I'm outgrowing him. He's never intentionally done me dirty, but he lives in a very different world where and he's never needed to consider much outside his 4 walls. This one hurts though because I know the value of the weights and I can't ask him to buy me new equipment because 1) he can't afford it and 2) I doubt he'll even feel guilty/the need to.

I just think a heads up would have been nice so that I could have had a chance to put the gear in a storage unit or at least tried to sell it. But instead I had to ask about my stuff only to learn it's gone. 

AITA for scolding him and telling him I might need a break from this friendship? Should I not be expecting more from my best friend of 20 years?

89,1g0v09k,"AITA for not going with my friend to a ""party""","Hi, before we start I want to say I'm not very good at English,so sorry for the typos.

This happen  months ago , around July ,my (19 f) , friend let's name her May (also 19f)  asked me to come with her to a party. She said that our other friend (18F) will also come and that there will be many people. Also to mention, the guy who's is making this party is May's friend. May said that she'll call me to make sure if I'm able to come. I agreed to come . The party was to set at Saturday .

Then a few days later,
the Saturday came and I never got the call from her.I made plans with my boyfriend to have a sleepover over his and then she suddenly calls me. It was like 10 pm at the time. She asked what I was doing and I told her I was at my boyfriends and she asked if I can come with her to that party because she didn't want to be alone with her male friend who is hosting that party. I asked May what about the other people that were attending and she said that no one is coming expect her. 

I said no , because my boyfriend lives far away from where the party is ,and I know I'll be bored with just two people. She started begging me and said that I could leave whenever I want . I know that I'll get bored in few minutes and plus I won't be able to go back home if I went there. Then I was done with begging and pressuring and I told her big NO and she should've called me earlier about this. Then she just said okay and that was it.


I called the other friend that was supposed to come and she agrees with me about this situation. But I've tried to reach out May and she ignored me every time. So AITA?


[EDIT] As I'm reading what I wrote,I realized that I didn't give enough info about this situation ,so here it is. I'm going to write everything in bullet points:

- May didn't tell me the exact time when this party is going to happen even after I asked.

-  May didn't tell the other friend that was supposed to go as well ,let's call her Jenna , that no one else will be there.

- Jenna lives far away so if she came along,she would be in the same situation if I went . So that's why she agreed with me.

- About me rejecting the invite after she called the second time. I didn't want to go for several reasons,as I've mentioned if I got bored  or if I was uncomfortable I couldn't go home because of transportation. Second,May   has this weird flirty personality whenever she's hanging out with a guy and I didn't want to be a third wheel. 


- May didn't want to be alone with her guy friend because she said it's embarrassing ( not to be seen with him but like she is 'shy')  even tho she's leading him on and flirts with him .


- When I said , she's going to check if I'm still going is because she didn't really know if the party is going to happen on Saturday,so she said that she'll call me back before Saturday to tell me if the party is still happening,she never did.

So that's about it with this edit,if you have any more questions ask away!

Because of that, they always said they wanted to spoil me since they missed out on so much stuff when they were young. As a family, we legally migrated to the US when I was 6 years old because they wanted to give me a better life. From my earliest memory that I can remember until recently, I’ve always felt my parents raised me with good morals and sense of personal/financial responsibility, as well as respect for other people. They weren’t perfect, but I feel they did a good job. I’ve almost never been told no from them and they have helped me out financially and with whatever needs I had. I almost feel like I didn’t completely develop myself because of how protected I was. Nevertheless, I’ve been grateful to them.

Since the pandemic, however, my parents have drastically changed their personalities in ways that I sometimes feel I got thrown into an alternate timeline. My dad cheated on my mom in 2022 with various women that live in the same city where he works, consequently digging himself into a massive hole of debt with credit cards and loans, all of which he used to fund his affairs. My mom, on the other hand, finally fulfilled her dream of becoming a travel agent and spends a lot of her time traveling and spending what she makes from her job, only she doesn’t save a single cent of it, therefore, she always runs out of money before she is paid again. 

Now it’s two years later, and I graduated college and managed to get a starting well-paying job at a bank in my city. I’m 24, so my goal for 2025 is to save up to be able to move out and start my own life so that my parents no longer have to worry about me. To make their matters much worse, I just found out that almost all of my dad’s credit cards and personal loans have gone into collections after months of him not paying them at all (granted, he’s been struggling to find any steady work for months) and my mom only recently started to try to forgive him for all of his affairs, so they simultaneously decided together to redecorate and work on our house instead of working to get out of debt. 

I told my parents that I’m going to be saving $1,000 every month and still have some left over which will be enough to pay for my own necessities while still living with them. They have repeated to me numerous times that they feel I should be contributing to help fix their debt and financial problems, but I always ask them how they can possibly think it’s responsible to redecorate and renovate parts of the house as well as spend money on luxuries when their main priority should be to become debt free, something that THEY TAUGHT ME when I was growing up.

They have repeated to me numerous times that they feel I should be contributing to help fix their debt and financial problems, but I always ask them how they can possibly think it’s responsible to redecorate and renovate parts of the house as well as spend money on luxuries when their main priority should be to become debt free, something that THEY TAUGHT ME when I was growing up.

Help me, do I leave this never ending financial dumpster fire behind, or do I suck it up and help them out even though there’s no end in sight to their irresponsibility?",0.0,-0.008140766061842442,0,1
93,1g0tts1,AITA for not going to my friends party ,"My fiancé, Ken (27M), and I (23F) are getting married soon. We were introduced by our friends, Spencer (27M) and Ashley (25F), who recently started dating at the time. Spencer has known Ken since high school, and I’ve been friends with Ashley since I was 11.

Before Ken and I started dating, he had a girlfriend, Beca. Beca knew Spencer and had met Ashley a few times. I had also met Beca before, but Ken and Beca were just friends at that time. Fast forward, Ken and I have been together for almost four years and are engaged.
A few months ago, Ken and I were invited to a party at Ashley and Spencer’s house. To our surprise, Beca showed up. We hadn’t seen her since we officially started dating. Spencer came over and said, “Hey guys, I’m sorry, I didn’t know Beca would be here.” Ken and I thought it was Spencer and Ashley’s roommate, Max, who invited her. Max is a longtime friend of Ken’s, so we shrugged it off.

During the party, several friends approached us, acknowledging how odd it was for Beca to be there, but making sure we were okay. The next day, Ken called Max to set boundaries and ask to be notified if Beca would be invited to future events. Max explained that Spencer had considered inviting Beca, but they both agreed it wouldn’t be fair to us, so Max was surprised to see her too. This made things seem odd, so Ken spoke to Spencer, and they came to an agreement. Spencer apologized, saying he and Beca were just good friends. However, I was disappointed that Spencer tried to blame someone else for Beca’s presence.

Weeks later, Ken and I were invited to another party at Ashley and Spencer’s. We assumed Beca wouldn’t be invited but called Spencer to confirm. Spencer revealed that Ashley had invited Beca. In response, Ken and I declined the invitation. Shortly after, I received a message from Ashley, pleading for me to attend and assuring me it wouldn’t be uncomfortable. I told her my concern wasn’t discomfort, but the fact that it felt disrespectful for them to continue forcing us and our friends into a situation with someone we had respectfully separated from three years ago.

I suggested having a separate celebration, but Ashley left me on read. I’m upset with both Ashley and Spencer, feeling their loyalties have changed, though Ken keeps reminding me that Beca helped Spencer through his divorce, just as Ken did.

94,1g0tq0w,AITA For not telling my parents about my sisters (ex) girlfriend ,"I know the title seems self explanatory but to be honest I’ve been getting people telling me I’m in the wrong, so I need Radom strangers to tell me 

My sister came out as Bi (to the poorly hidden dismay of my Christian parents) around two years ago, when she was still 16. She also said that she no longer believed in Christianity, much to the dismay of both of them 

I’m the years after that she had off and on relationships with boys, but never any girls. Eventually though, she meet a girl that she really liked, and, they started dating.
Now, my sister never told my parents, because they are very judgmental, and even the relationships with boys were looked at with suspicion (sex before marriage is basically worse then murder in my family) 

Eventually, my sister let it slip in a conversation with me that she was dating a girl, I was completely fine with it, but she also begged that I keep it from my parents, I agreed, knowing how they can be 

Eventually, my sister and her gf started having relationship problems, this interfered with her school life, and made my parents suspicious 

They eventually asked her what was wrong, and she admitted that she was in a relationship, but told them that it was with a boy. 

My parents tried a couple of time to bring up the topic with me, asking about the boy and if I had met him, but I just skirted the conversation, and tried to throw them off the trail 

Eventually though, my sister and her gf had a large falling out, leaving her crying in my mom’s arms and, as a result, spilling her guts about the situation 

My mom immediately came to me to ask if I had known it was a girl, and, the secret being out, I stupidly said yes 

That was a mistake, leading to yelling about not being a good son, and lying by omission to them 

Eventually they calmed down, but took away my phone to keep me from “being feed lies” 

When I told my friends at school about this whole situation, many of them told me that I was in the right, but, my girlfriend at the time said that I should have told my parents about the gf

96,1g0tduj,AITA for cutting off my mothers side of the family completely,"This is very graphic, if don't like reading about child abuse I would avoid this post. I will be leaving out key details so you hopefully can't find out anyone's identification, if you find my mothers information please keep it to yourself.

When I was 3 my dad was out of the picture due to being in the special forces, my mother was as left alone to watch me and my brother.
We was often neglected, left home alone, wasnt fed, and physically abused. I ended up having my arms broken, several ribs, as well as several fingers and toes. My brother didn't get off so lucky and she ended up killing him right in front of me. She went to jail for a very short amount of time. During the time she was in jail my dad came home from the military and continued the abuse, I think he was frustrated about the situation and took it out on me. As an adult I finally understand what my dad went through, though I would never do the same to my kid if I was in the same situation. My mother would also beat my dad, she even ran him over with a car several times.

My mother got out of prison after a very short sentence. I eventually learned more about the case and found out the court case didn't include the abuse to either of us just the fact that she kill my brother and she pleaded insanity.

I tried to forgive my mom regardless, meeting her maybe once or twice a month. When we met all I would hear is that she wants grand children, even though the last kid she had she beat to death brutally. When I took her out to mothers day at this nice restaurant she would just talk about how she would get railed by countless guys while tied up, keep in mind I was 17 at the time and was super uncomfortable about the whole situation. All the people around us just stared and I was so embarrassed, I just thought how can a person act like this in public... After this I stopped seeing her nearly as much maybe 10 times over the next 5 years.

Time goes forward, I'm getting married, my mom comes into the picture and starts getting upset because several of my family members don't want her at the wedding. I told her she can come anyways, I think it's her right as I'm her son. It blows up and she ends up getting extremely mad at people and blaming everything on me. At this point I've given up. I gave her so many chances and I just can't deal with her anymore. The thing is, everyone on her side of the family sides with her and they are all just a vulger and nasty as she is, so I decided to cut off the entire family.

I've had people die, people I used to love and I feel nothing. I didn't attend their funerals and people on my mom's side see me as a monster worst than her. But I don't see them as family, nor do I think I should care about their life when they didn't care about my brothers.

102,1g0s05d,AITA for no longer being concerned that my son refuses to deal with me? ,"Let me start this off with I love my child, I've fought and fought for many years with his mother to be in his life. Only to be met with resistance consistently. She honestly didn't care if I was there or not as long as the child support was paid I heard nothing from her.


I truly believe she did not want me his life. Planning things on my scheduled visitations & not letting it be made up the following weekend got aggravating. When it came to things he wanted to, I was not going to stop him from doing them. I did not mind sacrificing the time. I understand he's gonna want to hang out with friends, gf & go to family events.


I made the biggest mistake telling her one day that he could come when he wanted. He has friends, a gf & is a teen. I understand I was that age once. Let him have fun. This ultimately backfired. After that phone call I saw him once more & that was it. To this day I do not know what was said to him & that was 7 years ago. I couldn't have his phone number or email. To be clear he's now an adult & I still don't know his phone #. He refuses to see or speak to me or anyone on my side of the family. 


She let him talk to my mother before she passed so she could say goodbye, only to turn & say I kept it from him. Knowing I told her long before.


I ended up having a conversation with a friend about this as she had asked me about it. I told her I've yet to hear from him & am not worried about it. I've stopped worrying about things I can't control long ago. 


She asked me a question ""HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HE NEVER bothered with you for the rest of your life, never let you know if you were a grandparent & just never let you know anything about his life?"" 


I told her I had thought about that before & to be honest it wouldn't bother me. I've been estranged for 7 years now. I've missed all the major milestones, missed seeing him become an adult, at this point I have no idea who he is & he is basically a stranger to me. At some point you accept that this your situation and there's not much you can do. 


After a while you stop caring because you realize you'll drive yourself crazy & keep yourself depressed for something you have 0 control over.


This answer did not go over well. Let me state this first; she's married & has children. I believe this will add context to why she responded the way she did. Which I understood & respected as we all have our views, but I do not agree with. 


She said that I am have become heartless, cold & can't believe I'd think that way after the all the years of fighting I did. She said she never in a million years would think I would have thought like that. You are a parent, you are supposed to never stop fighting no matter how many walls you have to climb. I'm truly shocked & disappointed that you'd think like this. I love you, we've been good friends for many years, but I can't agree with your line of thought on this. 


So Reddit, what do you think 🤔 AITA for my view of this situation with my son? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for no longer being concerned that my son refuses to deal with me?  Let me start this off with I love my child, I've fought and fought for many years with his mother to be in his life. Only to be met with resistance consistently. She honestly didn't care if I was there or not as long as the child support was paid I heard nothing from her.


I truly believe she did not want me his life. Planning things on my scheduled visitations & not letting it be made up the following weekend got aggravating. When it came to things he wanted to, I was not going to stop him from doing them. I did not mind sacrificing the time. I understand he's gonna want to hang out with friends, gf & go to family events.


I made the biggest mistake telling her one day that he could come when he wanted. He has friends, a gf & is a teen. I understand I was that age once. Let him have fun. This ultimately backfired. After that phone call I saw him once more & that was it. To this day I do not know what was said to him & that was 7 years ago. I couldn't have his phone number or email. To be clear he's now an adult & I still don't know his phone #. He refuses to see or speak to me or anyone on my side of the family. 


She let him talk to my mother before she passed so she could say goodbye, only to turn & say I kept it from him. Knowing I told her long before.


I ended up having a conversation with a friend about this as she had asked me about it. I told her I've yet to hear from him & am not worried about it. I've stopped worrying about things I can't control long ago. 


She asked me a question ""HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF HE NEVER bothered with you for the rest of your life, never let you know if you were a grandparent & just never let you know anything about his life?"" 


I told her I had thought about that before & to be honest it wouldn't bother me. I've been estranged for 7 years now. I've missed all the major milestones, missed seeing him become an adult, at this point I have no idea who he is & he is basically a stranger to me. At some point you accept that this your situation and there's not much you can do. 


After a while you stop caring because you realize you'll drive yourself crazy & keep yourself depressed for something you have 0 control over.

103,1g0rxzz,AITAH for watching a movie without my GF,"I (M20) love to watch movies, it’s one of my favorite hobbies/passtimes. My GF (F19) strongly dislikes movies. She much prefers tv shows so when we hang and watch things together, we usually default to a tv show. I don’t have much of a problem with this, and we on rare occasions we will watch a movie. I have a large watchlist of movies I want to see, and we sometimes agree to watch one of them, but when the time comes to watch it she had changed her mind so we end up watching a show instead, which can be slightly annoying at times.

Where the problem arose is that I had the day off a couple days ago while my gf was at work, so I turned on a movie I was excited to watch. It had been 3 weeks or so since the last movie I had seen which is a long time for me. When she got off work and asked what I did that day, I told her I watched a movie. She got upset with me because she said that she would have wanted to watch it with me, and I explained that we’ve tried to watch this particular one more than a few times and she changed her mind everytime. She is still upset with me and thinks I was being inconsiderate.

104,1g0rvkw,AITA for telling my neighbor to stay off of my property?,"Background: Neighbor clears forest (on his property) up to my back door, and installs one of those wire fences, supported with those green metal fence posts. In the process of his land clearing, he comes onto our property, and pushes trees over a trail that I had cut out to transport my kayak to the river (our property)Also digs out a large hole in the beginning of the trail, in my opinion, to clearly show that he doesn't want me using it. I show the man fire insurance (GIS) maps of the surrounding land plots which clearly show that he has messed up something on our property. He argues that ""the maps are out dated, I own that land""... When i pointed out to him that the map was updated at the beginning of the year, the only reply I receive is crickets. (I believe he filled in the massive hole he created with stones (fair... thank you for trying to fix it). 

A year goes by, and I notice that he has begun cutting down bushes and small sapling trees on my side of the fence (where we can't directly see anything from inside the house) and just leaving them there on our property, (I assume he did this because he has some planter boxes near there and was worried about these small bushes and saplings blocking sunlight. (form planter boxes that didn't have anything in them) I very politely explained to him through text that although I am a renter, I have been at that property for over 10 years (not any of his business but was trying to explain where I am coming from) and that I, nor anyone else that lives in our home, would go onto his property, and start cutting bushes and trees and just leaving them there in the yard. HE sends a very short ""I understand"" text back, no apology..... 

4 more months go by. It is Spring. Only had 2 opportunities to mow our massive lawn before the riding mower breaks. So our grass is long at the moment, as I am trying to find a used ride on, for cheap. The neighbor sends me a text along the lines of ""Do you mind getting your grass off of my fence"".... Mind you the other side of the fence (his property) is mostly dirt, with random piles of junk laying everywhere that we have had to look at for the last 7 or 8 years (never mentioned anything about this to him.... I try very hard to keep to myself, and mind my business)..... Now, after these things considered (and a couple other incidents i didn't list here) my text response back to him was not so polite. I explained to him that his fence is not my priority, or responsibility. And I couldn't care less what happens to his wire fence.... My thought is because I have politely asked this guy to stay off of my property.... That he's just going to make things difficult for me.

105,1g0rn9n,AITA for being mad that our cat sitters didn't scoop the litter for 2 weeks?,"This happened years ago but I get so annoyed every time I think about it so I need verdicts.

My boyfriend and I had an arrangement with a couple we were friends with where we would watch each other's cats whenever we traveled. They took advantage of it much more often because they went on a lot of vacations, had family in other states, plus more money to travel. Our family is local and we're homebodies so our cats rarely needed watching and always for no more than 3-4 days. This didn't bother us because we love animals and are always happy to care for them with no payment or anything expected. As far as we knew this arrangement was a happy one on both sides. 

This was until we planned a very rare (for us) trip for two weeks. The couple we knew instantly agreed to watch our three cats and we were relieved to have that sorted.

CUT TO the day we got back. I walked inside and was instantly hit with the stench of ammonia. Our ""friends"" had not scooped the litter boxes even once in the two weeks we were gone. Each box contained a solid block of pee-soldered litter festooned with copious amounts of stool. At some point the cats had started peeing on our clothes and couch and I do not blame them. We were not mad at the cats and felt terrible for the stressful time they had endured. We had to deal with this massive biohazard situation and run out to get new litter boxes and products to deodorize the couch.

We were enraged and could not imagine why this happened. The couple was indignant and baffled that we were so upset. They felt that ""taking care of the cats"" just meant feeding them and checking the water dish, not scooping the litter. This makes no sense since they had cats of their own for most of their lives so they know that litter is part of it. We ALWAYS scooped their cats' litter when we were watching them, so I don't know where they thought all that pee and poop was going while they were away\*. We left them an instruction sheet with the cats' diets and serving portion but did not specify scooping because we thought that any rational person would know you need to scoop litter and we left the scoop out. They refused to apologize or reimburse us for the new litter boxes and sanitation supplies, and basically acted like we were the AHs for being upset. They said things like ""you weren't even paying us!"" even though we had performed the same duties for them far more times and always for free.

They are wealthy, by the way, thanks to a lucky stock option early on in the man's career. They don't need the money.

So are we the AHs for cutting them out of our lives? If they had acknowledged wrongdoing and apologized it might have been different but they were 100% obstinate that we were being unreasonable in our expectations and our anger.

\* We didn't notice that they weren't scooping for us because we'd usually only be gone for a day or two at a time so there wasn't enough accumulation to really notice until the two weeks of buildup occurred.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-10,"AITA for being mad that our cat sitters didn't scoop the litter for 2 weeks?
