0,1g1hu2a,AITAH if I were to report something to the office?,"I am a junior in High School, recently someone made a page for my school as some of known ‘It’s finally Friday’ on instagram, it’s a slideshow that shows students doing random things with the caption ‘finally Friday’ 

And in one of the pictures it shown a black male, who is on the toilet who accidentally fell asleep. It doesn’t show his you know what as it’s covered by his stomach due to him being ‘chubby’. When coming across this I was horrified, I’m not sure if the boy even knows..

My friends found it funny, people reposted this specific picture but it made me VERY uncomfortable seeing this. I didn’t like it once. As I feel like it’s basically bullying.

I’m sure some kids my age will say I’m just being sensitive and it’s just a picture but it lacks privacy, and posting it online is such a low blow. And especially taking a picture from above the stall since it was locked (as it looks like from the picture) is messed up.

I spoke about this with my cousin who’s in the same grade level as me but she said I’ll be ‘lame’ if I was to report it and obviously if the boy had an issue he could report it himself.

But imagine this person behind the account posts this, what if they post something worser? I just don’t want it getting out of hand..

This whole situation is just messed up to me and knowing this kid is walking around school probably being made fun of because some person thought it’ll be fully to post. 

I’m just not too sure what to do.

1,1g1htgl,AITA for using the disabled bathroom when I just have IBS?,"At my university there's bathrooms in every corridor, with easily 20 stalls in each, just one stall for disabled people. Going from one bathroom to another takes less than a minute. I prefer using the disabled ones since they are big and you can't hear anything (normal ones have the typical walls that don't go up to the ceiling or the floor)

I have not seen anyone with obvious visible disabilities but I still will only go into the bathroom if there's no one going in at the same time as me. I know I might not realize that someone needs to use it so I'll just wait until I see no one. There's SO many stalls in every bathroom I literally have never seen half of them full so it's never a problem. I have also never seen anyone go inside the disabled ones. 

I am not disabled, but I have huge anxiety over going to the bathroom. It takes me a while. It hurts. There's noises. (Sorry for the tmi). Nothing gross, and even if it was I will always leave the bathroom cleaner than I've found it. That's in general btw, not only at uni.

Today I went in, and when I got out there was an older woman who saw me and immediately started screaming at me in German (don't speak the language so i got very confused). I literally ran out and a girl that saw the exchange explained she was calling me a inconsiderate AH because Im obviously not disabled and I was in there a while (like 6/7minutes). She went in after I left.

3,1g1hdsv,AITA for leaving my sister?,"About 3 years ago, my grandmother passed. My oldest sister asked if we could drive out of state to the funeral together to cut costs for her and her daughter (my niece). I agreed and booked a rental car.

My sister told me she was fed up with me asking, her cashapp wasn't working, she didn't care to go anymore and then blocked me.

5,1g1h4ot,AITA For lying to my wife's friends after an argument,"My wife (39F) and I (40M) have been married for 8 years and have a 4-year-old son.  We both work full time have a good handle on household duties and expectations.  My wife has been really busy at her job the past 6 weeks or so.  Her job does a lot of seasonal work and this time of the year is among their busiest.  They have a lot of seasonal workers they hire to help, and they held a party/happy hour for them last week.  

The week before the party, my wife was at a work conference for 4 days while I was holding down the home front.  The day of the party, she told me that she would only stay until 6-7 so that she could be home for our son's bedtime.  I went about our normal evening routine with our son and got a text from my wife at about 7:15 telling me that she was just wrapping up and would be home soon.

I put our son to bed and started doing some cleaning and the next thing I know, it's 9pm and my wife isn't home so I text her to see if she's ok.  She calls back a few minutes later and tells me she's still talking with people but will be heading home soon.  I was a little frustrated and annoyed by this.

When she got home, I told her that I would appreciate a little more communication from her if her plans are going to change like that.  She got defensive and told me that I am not supporting her and that she needs to feel like she has the freedom and agency to do social things without me ""policing and parenting"" her and that she lost track of time.  I told her that 90 minutes is a long time to lose track of and that it takes 20 seconds to send a text.  She got mad and went off to bed.  

That weekend, she had a few friends over for cocktails.  My wife was inside doing something, so I went out to the patio and said hi to her friends.  I then asked them if I could get their opinion on a disagreement my wife and I had.  I told them the story about my wife's work party but lied and told them that it was me that stayed out without updating my plans.  

They started going off on me for not respecting my wife enough to give her an update after 90-minutes and that even though it's important for parents to have social time, I need to recognize that the only way I can do that is by my wife staying home with our son.  They all told me I owe my wife an apology and that I need to do better.

In the middle of their admonishment of me, my wife came out and asked what we were talking about.  One of her friends said that I had just told them about the party the previous week and they were telling me I need to apologize. My wife looked confused and said, ""But I was the one who had the work party.""

I was sitting there with a little smirk on my face and my wife got pissed.  Her friends did too.  Her friends told me I was a jerk for lying to them and tricking them.  I asked them if their advice for me still applies to my wife and they all got defensive and tried to change their stories.  My wife got upset because I embarrassed her.

6,1g1gsl4,AITA for calling my friend immature and bringing up her exes? ,"Throwaway because she knows my main account. 

I (24NB) have a friend I'll call Lina (23F). Lina & I used to be pretty close but due to reasons we aren't as close though we still care for each other. I've been friends with Lina since she was born as our mothers were friends. 

Lina recently told me and our other childhood friend, I'll call him Krys, that she's pregnant and expecting her next child. We both congratulated her but she said it seemed like we didn't care about her pregnancy and weren't happy for her. I said I was happy for her because I know she wanted kids with her boyfriend but she kept pushing us to tell her what we really felt.

I got annoyed with her and told her that I was happy for her but I was tired of her acting immature and pushing people for answers that she knows are going to hurt her feelings. She said if I was being honest about being happy for her then the answer wouldn't hurt her feelings so I told her that I am happy for her but I think she's being irresponsible because she already has two young children with two different men and she isn't getting child support from either of them so I don't think she should be having another one yet.

She called me a bitch for that and said it's not my place to say that because I don't know what she went through. I said that considering she never shut up about about it and used me as a therapist, I do know, which I admit myself I was an asshole for that. I said that I know she wants kids with her boyfriend but she needs to actually get her life together first because she doesn't have a job nor child support and she's still suffering trauma from her past whilst refusing therapy and it's going to fuck up the kids life. 

Now she's not talking to me and Krys is telling me that she's trying to talk badly about me to our other friends. I don't want to lose my friendship with her but I'm tired of her acting childish and immature. Krys & his wife agree with me that Lina needs to grow up and so do a few other people but then some are bitching at me for saying it. 

I have been informed by our mutual friend that she is now getting child support from one dad, which I don't get why she didn't tell me but whatever, but I still think she's being ridiculous. I am happy for her to get what she wants but I'm not happy about her decisions.

My mum and I went to pick up my sister from work and then we came back. I went upstairs to go play FIFA. I was playing with my friends on my XBOX and then i heard arguing. I’ve heard them bicker before but it hasn’t gotten to this level before. I got up and went to the stairs, my sister explained everything. In a brief summary. 

My mum asked her to collect her clothes from the washing line, she said had asked if she could collect them later as her arm was hurting (caused by an early injury) and she was exhausted from working 9-5. My mum said “Fine, but if your clothes get wet from the rain it’s your problem.” In a bit of a mean tone. That’s when the argument started. 

But then it went even further when my mum said she to my sister that she should “Set an alarm for early in the morning to clean the whole house.” Which is really odd because she doesn’t even do that.

12,1g1gads,AITA. for blowing up on my dad,"On a throwaway cause a lot of family follow me on my real.
Necessary warnings: on mobile, english isn't my first language, so sorry.

Ok so I (f24) was ""raised"" by my single dad.  In reality it was mostly ne raising myself. He traveled for work a lot when I was younger which I can understand, but the biggest problem growing up was him just putting me down whatever I do. 
And when I was 16 I started dating my girlfriend (f24), and that's what destroyed what little good relationship we had. A day couldn't pass without him being homophobic to me or her.
But whenever I complained to anyone in my family they all told me I should respect and okay him like any good daughter would. 
As soon as I got into uni I moved as far away from him as I could, but was shamed into keeping contact with him and visiting whenever I could. This is still the case. Whenever I try to cut contact, on just try to not visit dozen family members blow my phone up and I cave.
Sorry for such a long backstory but I think it's important. Onto the story: last week was his birthday, and since i work remotely I went to visit him. I bought him a nice gift, a very nice fishing rod because he got into fishing recently. It cost me around 100 dollars in my currency. When I gave it to him he thanked me like this ""thank you, i guess"" and them told me I should have just given him the money or asked what he wanted cause he already has a rod. I don't know what happened but I snapped. I started yelling at him, telling him everything he did that made me hate him, and the only reason I was here was because I was shamed by bunch of family members. I ended my rant by grabbing my bag and yelling a huge fuck you before slamming the door. I went to my girlfriends parents house, and my grandmother went there telling me how my father was in tears, and how I broke his heart and I should apologize. I almost caved but my girlfriends mom kicked her out. Since then I feel that every family member texted me either calling me an asshole, guilt tripping me or both. I think I'm not an asshole but I need more opinions.

But just a few years ago everything changed. Doesn't work hard, care, or well anything. Just started getting lazy. Hardly ever cooks for himself, does laundry, or anything. Complaining to anyone that life isn't fair and giving him the chances he needs to be successful. Like dude, you were on a great path to climb up any ladder. All you had to do was take a step.

A couple of days ago, I said that to him when he started to complain to me. I told him, ""If you stop being lazy when stuff gets going, you'll be successful or at least giving yourself a chance."" I got called a bad friend. I left him a job application for my job. I was told if he applied, he'd get hired.

My dad and mom divorced when I was young. I have 2 older brothers and they got college paid for. I did not. The reason my dad gave us that he will pay for my wedding with the same amount of money instead. My dad’s argument is that the men should pay for their own wedding as it looks good on them but a woman paying for a wedding is shameful. But a man needs a good education to pay for the wedding, a woman can expect things from her future husband including paying off her student loans. I’m Indian so the weddings are huge and as expensive or more expensive than a college degree. But the problem is my student loans need monthly payments regardless which prevent me from doing other things whereas I don’t even know if I want to have a wedding. I don’t even know if I want to marry and expecting a man to pay off my student loans sees ridiculous now as I out earn most men in my age range. He also expects me to have 2 weddings which I doubt I will do which will probably piss him off and he will refuse to pay for my wedding unless I do another one in India. 

After arguing with my dad about his somewhat old fashion beliefs, I paid off my student loans to avoid more interest and stopped talking to him. My dad says being raised by a single mom (that he created) means I will not want to marry because I’m not use to a man around and he wants to make sure I marry. I think this is his way to control me.

19,1g1dyjx,AITAH for not getting my boyfriend breakfast and sleeping instead? ,"
My (22M) boyfriend is upset with me (23F) because instead of getting him breakfast a little over an hour before I had to be at work I decided to continue sleeping. For some context, I work from home and usually don’t get up until about 10-15 minutes before I need to clock in. Since I work from home and luckily I don’t have to be on camera, I just get up, walk my dog, wash my face, and then clock into work. The night before my boyfriend did mention he wanted me to wake up  an hour before I had to be at work and go grab him breakfast. I politely told him that I won’t be waking up to get him breakfast because I try to sleep in as long as possible. I am a very light sleeper and multiple times throughout the night I wake up due to even the littlest noise and sometimes it’s very hard for me to fall back asleep. This is why I try to get as much sleep as possible. 

This morning my boyfriend woke me up when he decided to get up for the day which was over an hour before I had to be up. I quickly ran to the bathroom and was headed to lay back down when my boyfriend stopped me and said he wanted me to go get him breakfast. I told him that I wanted to go back to sleep since I had to be up for work soon and that I was going to lay back down and so I did. I woke up a little over an hour later to my alarm, got up and did my normal routine. I tried talking to my boyfriend but he was ignoring me and acting very pouty. He continued this behavior until he left for work, leaving without saying a word. I called him after the left and asked why he was acting the way he was. After him being standoffish for about five minutes on the phone. He said that he’s upset because all he wanted me to do was get him food before work and I chose to sleep instead of getting him food. 

We are currently sharing one car, so I am unable to go grab food and drop it off to his work place so I offered to DoorDash him food. He told me no and that he can’t eat food at work because he is super busy. So then I offered him lunch from what ever place he wanted and I would pay for it. He turned down that offer because he said he is going to be too busy to get food. 

AITAH because I didn’t get him breakfast and chose to sleep? I am very conflicted because I feel maybe I should have just gotten up instead of sleeping to get him food. 


Edit: I seem to be getting a lot of questions in regard to if it was a special day or if we had done something different. Nope, it was not a special day just another Friday. I think I may have said Thursday in a comment but I meant to say Friday. I actually bought groceries yesterday and included some breakfast items. 

Edit 2: First I would like to thank everyone who gave me their opinions! I would like to answer a few questions I have seen to hopefully give more context. 1) Does he randomly buy me breakfast? No he does not, when we have any type of breakfast I am usually the one to grab it or cook it. 2) Was he busy? When I woke up he was sitting at his gaming table watching TikTok so I would assume he wasn’t busy, but I am not exactly sure how his work days go because one day it can be super busy and the next not so much. 3) Why couldn’t he pick it up on his way to work? I also asked him this question and he told me he didn’t want his clothes to smell like food. 4) How do I have enough time to walk my dog? In the morning we do a very quick use the potty than come inside. I take her out multiple times throughout the day to walk since I work from home and we do a long walk late at night!

22,1g1d5cw,AITA for leaving my dad to live with my mom?,"This is something that happened a few years ago, but I still feel like I'm the asshole. 



I(17 tm) moved out of my dad's (46 at the time) house when I was 14. I moved in with my mom(42 at the time) because when I was with my dad my mental state was depleting.(it was stuff that got me sent to the hospital) After moving in with her I felt amazing, I was finally experiencing happiness on a regular basis. I enjoyed living for the first time in years.

My mental state wasn't the only reason I moved out. He never made any effort to have a relationship with me after the age of 6. Most of my childhood memories are of me trying to enjoy things he liked, so he would spend time with me. I eventually realized he didn't see me as his child, but a babysitter for his kids and someone he could show off to keep his reputation. 

I realized this after many years of a simple good job for getting all A's, and almost getting grounded for a C. This wouldn't have been a problem if he hadn't rewarded my older brother for just barely passing his classes. 

Before my dad got remarried, I cleaned the house and cooked while he played cod on his ps4 after work. (my brother played with him) That started when I was 8, and continued until I moved out.

He always told other people how good of a daughter I was, getting good grades and helping around the house.(this is funny because he had nothing but shit to say about me after I left) I did something when I was 13(not allowed to say what bc of the guidelines) that finally made me realize that he only saw me as a way to uphold his reputation because he went on and on about how I ruined it.

I fully realized the extent of how much I was caring for his kids when I moved out and my sisters started complaining about how they had to take care of his wife's kids all the time.

Not to mention the time when I was 10, and he said to me ""I never wanted kids, especially not this many. I regret letting your mom talk me into having kids. I regret having all of you""

when I moved out he spent hours talking to my mom about how lazy I was, how I never appreciated anything he did for me, how I was narrow-minded, and that the only reason I was mad at him was because he missed one of my marching band performances. He only went to three the whole season, the reason I was mad about that one specifically is bc it was a 15-minute drive and a $5 entry fee. (he missed it to wash dishes)

When I came out as trans, he told me he'd always see me as his daughter, and said he's never going to refer to me by my preferred name. He said it was too much work, and that he was fine calling me my dead name and referring to me as his daughter.

23,1g1d1qx,AITA for refusing to let my mom take things from my house to give to her cult leader?,"For context, my parents are Muslim (I'm agnostic). They follow a branch of Islam with a heavy emphasis on philosophy. Growing up, I was often subjected to these religious discussions and visits to a ""Respected Elder"" who led these spiritual gatherings. My parents have followed multiple elders over the years, bringing them gifts as a form of respect. As a child, I believed it was normal until I grew up and realized it felt very cult-like.

One such elder, “Grumpy Elder,” lives in the city where I attend university. A few years ago, my mom insisted we visit him before driving back home. Reluctantly, I agreed. During the visit, I was shocked when my mom got on her knees and kissed his foot. This was the moment I felt fully disgusted and realized I no longer respected these elders.

Today, as I’m preparing to move back home, my mom wanted to visit Grumpy Elder again. I told her she could, but then noticed she was packing items from my house—a large can of olive oil and a pack of Earl Grey tea—as gifts for him. I refused, telling her that he already gets enough from his followers and has a decent pension.

Yesterday, this neighbor sent me a message via social media saying that another child called another child a derogatory term. The child that said this term is a neighborhood kid that my child plays with occasionally, not my child. The child being called the name was her child’s friend. My response was polite and concerned. I told her I would speak to that child (even though he is not mine) and tell his parents and have a talk with my child to ensure they know that behavior is unacceptable. 
This morning, I woke up to a message asking if my child and I were looking in this neighbors car windows with a flashlight. I explained that my child lost her phone while playing with all the kids in the street, and that Find My Iphone was pinging right where her car was. Since her child was outside (approximately 13 years old) we looked under the car and on the roof of the car as well as on the hood. It may have looked like we were looking in her car (we did not), but her child was there so we did not feel this was inappropriate. Now the neighbor is saying “I instructed my child to turn the other way and not hangout with your kids anymore”, and “since there are no boundaries, just stay away”.
I feel like this is being a bit blown out of proportion and I am wondering if I am the a**hole. I have no problem respecting her wishes to stay away, but why the aggression? There is more background to the story in which the child who had been called a derogatory name had stolen items from my child. I am not saying the name calling was ok, in fact, it really upset me to hear that happened, but I do not quite understand why my neighbor is upset with me and my children.

Today she randomly found something in his mouth that he was chewing on, she had no idea what it was, or how much he had potentially ate.  She pulled it out of his mouth and it was mushy and she said she tasted it and it had a ""soapy"" taste. 

Having no idea what it was, she went around the house tasting random chemicals trying to match the flavor to what she pulled out of his mouth.  At the time she said she had licked a dish washing pod, ate a corner of a laundry detergent sheet, took a bite of a hot glue stick, and licked a fabric glue stick. To no avail she still hasnt found the matching mystery flavor.

This caused a pretty big fight between the 2 of us. I told her it was very irresponsible as what if something happened to her from eating random chemicals around the house.  Her defense is that if she needed to call poison control that she would be more informed about the chemical he ingested.

31,1g1bghp,AITA for bringing up my partner’s noisy behavior while I tried to rest?,"I (29M) often let my partner (27 NB) sleep in. I tiptoe around, staying quiet so they can rest. They can sleep until 2 PM if allowed, but I usually wake them by 11 AM since we have things to do.

Recently, I’ve taken on more work, going from running my own business with a few weekly Zoom calls to adding a new job where I worked 59 hours over 10 days. It’s exhausting, and I’m currently battling what I think is the flu. My partner knows I’m not well. I’m also a full-time online student, working on assignments in my spare time. My partner hasn’t worked for about 10 months.

I’ve noticed a pattern of my partner being noisy when I’m trying to sleep, and they get defensive when I mention it. For example, I had a midnight-to-8 AM shift, so I told them I needed rest. I took melatonin, set an alarm, and napped. Less than an hour later, I woke up to them eating popcorn loudly in bed, the sound and smell waking me.

Another time, while trying to rest before a shift, they were using a bug zapper on the bed, making it shake. These incidents, among others, have been frustrating. That brings me to this morning.

I recently worked a double shift and came down with a bad cough. I didn’t sleep well yesterday since we had to go to the pharmacy for cough suppressants.

Last night, my partner snapped at me and then stormed out, they messaged saying they were overtired and needed sleep, but I could stay up. I went outside to take photos of the Northern Lights and cool down my fever, then returned quietly.

We have a litter of rescue puppies, and yesterday, we introduced them to puppy mush, which involves grinding kibble to prevent choking. This morning, I woke up at 7:30 AM to the loud sound of the grinder. I went to see what was happening, and my partner was making the mush. I was annoyed because we usually don’t feed the dogs before 9 AM. I stepped outside for a vape (I’m 24 days cigarette-free!), then came back in. I hadn’t planned to say anything, but my partner apologized, saying, “Sorry for waking you up with the grinder.”

I replied, “I just don’t understand why it had to be done at 7:30 AM.”

They said, “Because the puppies needed food.”

This frustrated me because I handle most of the dog responsibilities, and they rarely help. I mentioned that feeding the puppies didn’t have to happen so early, and they explained that the mama dog had spilled kibble, and they worried about the puppies choking. I suggested cleaning up the spill instead and mentioned that it feels like they’re intentionally waking me. They rolled their eyes, said “whatever,” and I walked away, heading back to the bedroom to type this out.

I feel like I’m making an effort to give them space to rest, but I don’t get the same in return. Even setting work and school aside, I’m sick, which they know means I need extra sleep to recover.

35,1g1arva,WIBTA If I call out GFs dad for disrespecting me?,"So me (36M) and my GF (36F) have been together for 2.5 years and we have lots of big plans for our future together, including kids and a shared apartment.

My GF is really big on spending time with family and wants me to come with her to visit her parents and grandparents regularly (atleast once every few weeks), which I usually do, even though I'm very much an introverted person, but not every time because sometimes I just feel like I need some alone time to recharge.

Here's where the issue comes in, because my GFs dad (59M) has a very... strong personality, and has no issues about stepping on anyones toes or speaking his mind quite unfiltered. He is a really intelligent and social person who loves to banter, often in quite a mean way, and he is quick to catch up on small details about people, and has a long memory. 

I'm usually not thin-skinned enough to let that stuff bother me, but recently he has started to take jabs at me, in areas where I feel the most awkward, which would be my social skills and introvertedness. He came over a while back to my place for dinner, and as he left he said to me ""you should meet up with us (him and my GF) more often, you could really practice being more social"", in quite a condescending way. I was a bit upset that he said that to me in my own home but I didn't comment on it to him or my GF.

And more my GF asked if I wanted to meet up with her dad at a restaurant for dinner, and since I felt it was a bit overdue on my part, I accepted. So we met up at a subway stop near the restaurant, and her dad looked at me with a surprised look on his face and said ""oh, I didn't think YOU would be here, why did you decide to join THIS time?"", again in a very condescending way. I laughed it off, and we walked together towards the restaurant.

As we were walking, he again said to me (paraphrasing) ""it's good that you're FINALLY coming out to practice your social skills, you are always just sitting at home. You need to learn to talk more, you're always too quiet and boring"". This really hurt my feelings, since I usually try to do my best to jump in and talk when I get the chance to, because he can go on never-ending monologues about almost anything.

Later that night, I told my girlfriend that I'm sick of being treated by her dad this way, because it's very clear to me that he dislikes me and looks down on me because of my personality. And that I would not silently take all these jabs from him anymore, and that I would firmly stand up for myself next time it happens. This really upset my GF, and she told me that's just his personality, and he is being mean to most people in his life and that I should just ignore it, because that's how he is.

Edit: To be clear, I did tell my GF about this before. She said it was not a big deal. But once I entered the country I had to agree I would register with police within 24 hours. I also told them again before going to the police.

Edit 2: To clarify further, I even did offer to go to a hotel, but my GF preferred I register vs going to a hotel as she did not want me to spend money.",0.0,1.0495821,1,0

She didn’t like that we moved in together so soon (fair) but then she also went to snoop through my digital past and find out things that my bf already knew, but used them as moral policing by saying things like “I didn’t think these were you preferences, I didn’t know you’d be okay with it.”

Anyway, she lives a couple hours away by car and the last time we visited, my bf asked her if I could stay at her place with him, to which she said “no I don’t feel like telling my husband you have a gf it’ll make me uncomfortable.” Which is wild because if I was just his friend, she’d be fine with it. I should also add she’s a bit religious/conservative (Islam), but we’re in a western country and my bf has made it clear he has no desire or intention to get married, ever. 

She then recently told him he needs to “get serious” and grow up because he’s living with his gf but doesn’t want to get married. He told his mom (it’s been a year) because she kept saying she was going to stay with him in the spring. So he finally told his mom that he lives with me and his mother has been faking illnesses and pushing him to get married to me. She is religious and cannot comprehend that two consenting 30 year old adults would live together. 

After all that, his sister asked him if the parents can come stay for 2 weeks when they come in the Spring. He said it’ll be 4 of us, including my gf, in a 1 bedroom apartment. Can we split an Airbnb for them instead, near your city? And she passive aggressively responded saying “I’ll manage. Have you talked to mom? She’s ill.” And then he felt guilty and asked me if it’s okay if they come stay with us for 2 weeks, and I said of course. He then called his sister back and she said “they’re not gonna be comfortable with that anyway so forget it they’ll just stay with me.” And it’s like… if you already knew that why fucking ask and make my bf feel guilty?!!!

Now, my bf clearly feels guilty and he wants to go see his sister for thanksgiving weekend here in Canada. I essentially said no, you only want to go so sporadically because they’re guilting you, we can make a proper plan and spend longer time during the December holidays — also I don’t want to be left alone on thanksgiving since his sister doesn’t want to tell her husband (who would have no issues with me staying with them) about my existence?

Our relationship is complicated, but we mainly rely on each other for financial stability, with me relying on her emotionally as well seeing as we are pretty good friends and me having attachment issues (already not a great situation, but it is what it is).

Anyway, she recently got a new job after being off of work for a few weeks. Her first day was Wednesday. She's notorious for being late to work. At her old job she'd regularly be 30-45 minutes late and was able to get away with it due to being highschool friends with her GM. Mind you, I had been the one driving her to and from work (15 minute drive) nearly everyday. So, as I'm driving her to her first shift to this new job on Wednesday (5ish minute drive from our apartment), I tell her she can't be late to this job because she won't be able to get away with it. She says she knows and I tell her from here on out if she's not ready to go by the time she needs to be (5:50am) I'm not going to drive her and she's going to have to find her own way to work, whether it's walking or Uber. This was my way of hopefully encouraging her to be on time.

Yesterday (Thursday), I had told her I'd wake her up since I'd probably be up already, but I had ended up falling asleep. I had set 3 alarms on the Alexa in the living room (where she sleeps) to wake her up instead. One for 5 am, one for 5:15 am, and one for 5:30am. She ended up being late, but I still drove her due to her saying she was expecting me to wake her up so I lowkey felt responsible, even though I had set 3 alarms for her. On the way to her work I told her what I said about not driving her if she's late still stands after this. She said ok.

Fast forward to this morning and I have an alarm routine setup on Alexa for her and I also have my alarm set for 5:45am, which is when I need to get up to take her to work. I wake up and get my shoes on and am ready to drive her, but she's in the bathroom not ready and ends up taking a quick shower at the time we should be heading out the door. I go back to my bed because I'm not going to drive her due to our previous agreement. She comes into my room 5 minutes later asking me to drive her and I tell her no because I was already up and ready and she wasn't, so I'm not driving her. She says ok and ends up walking to work, which makes her almost 45 minutes late, which could've been only 10 if I had decided to drive her instead. One part of me feels guilty since she was only running about 10 minutes behind, but the other part of me just wants her to learn a lesson and stop taking advantage of how flexible I've been in the past and actually be on time to her job.

46,1g17h7f,AITA for not planning what my friend wanted for their birthday?,"It is my friends (f29) birthday this weekend, she is turning 30. We have a good small friendship group of 4 girls and our partners, every birthday we get together, do small gifts at someones house, play games and we order food. It is usually a great night, no one has ever had a problem with this before. She is the first in our friendship group to reach 30, she suggested about a month prior that she wanted to do something a little more special, and suggested a restaurant she liked. We were all happy to do that, confirming that we would all do whatever she wanted for her day, she said we would confirm closer to the time. So we all proceed waiting for confirmation. 

About two weeks after this, she said she had changed her mind and would rather order food as we normally would- so we proceeded to get decorations and such ready for the night itself.

Now, it is a few days until we have planned her birthday night and she has put a message in our group chat essentially saying that she wanted to do something more special, that she didnt want to just sit around like usual, that she would be forcing herself to do it for our sake. We are a little confused by this, as she hasn't expressed this until now- we have went on to say we will still go out if she wanted but she said she was feeling ignored and that we hadn't listened to what she had asked for. I argued the case that if there was a booking made, we of course would have obligated but neither her or her partner had set any plans in place, nor asked any of us to do so. 

We have apologised, and tried to say we would still like to celebrate, that we just want her to be happy. We are just at a loss on what to do- some the group think we should proceed and still do the night as planned and try to encourage her to come, whereas the others are feeling a little like fuck it and dont think we should bother at all because they feel it is ungrateful for the effort made.

47,1g16lvg,AITA for telling my stepmom she's not an incentive for me to change my last name?,"My parents were never married so I (16m) have my mom's last name. She died when I was 5. My dad was already married to my stepmom at the time. But I admit I didn't really warm up to her because I picked up on tension between her and mom. After mom died it was worse because my stepmom would say things like ""you're finally where you belong"" and ""I'm so happy you're my little boy now"". It made me feel really icky and unhappy. My dad was never the hands on parent he liked to pretend to be so he'd just tell me to accept being loved. Two months after mom died the oldest of my three half sisters was born. It was a lot of change for me and I was very sad back then. I felt pretty alone. My stepmom was always trying to grow closer to me. She'd even sometimes hire babysitters for an entire day to spend her time trying to make me love her. It hurt her really bad when I'd shut her out. But I hated hearing her call me hers and she would tell me I was hers now and I needed a ""mommy"" because she did baby talk and titles with me until I was almost 12. I think she thought it would make me warm up faster.

She'd always call me by my middle name (James) because that was her dad's first name instead of using my first name. There were times she'd ask me if I wanted to change my name to James and ""be grandpa's junior!"" I always said no. Then when I was around 8 or 9 they tried to change both my first and last name. When they didn't take me to court the first time the judge asked to see me. He said kids would typically be present at court for something like that (I'm not sure if it's true or not but that's what I was told) and so I was brought the next time and asked how I felt about my new name. I said I didn't want to change my name. So my name remained the same. Mom's last name included.

It really bothers my stepmom that I don't share their last name. She has three girls and wants ""her only son"" to share the same name as her. She talked to me a few days ago and tried to convince me to make the change she and dad tried making a few years ago (first and last name). She told me to do it for her because it would make her really happy and I could present it as a Christmas or a birthday gift. I told her she wasn't an incentive for me to change my name because I don't want to be her boy and I don't accept her as my mom. She started to cry and she called me spoiled and bratty in retaliation.

48,1g167d0,AITA for not apologizing for making my sister run away?,"My sister is 14 and I'm 16. My sister's always had issues. She gets bullied in school a lot and has trouble keeping friends. It started when she was like 7 and the one girl who always targets her was bullying another kid. My sister was next to her in class and didn't lie to the teacher when asked if this girl was being mean. After that the girl focused just on my sister. This girl has a reputation for being really mean but she's also pretty popular too. I think after being bullied for so long, it's made her take it out on others. She does it to me. So I think that doesn't help her keep friends.

I tried being a supportive sister. I tried to help her socially and to be someone she could talk to. But she expects a lot out of me and gets pissed when I can't give it. Like when she wants me to spend less time with friends and spend time with her doing stuff he wants to do. I always spent time with her but she reached a point where I was basically meant to hang out with her if she had nobody else to spend time with and never see my friends. Other times she would call me ugly and say why was I never bullied at school but she gets bullied every year no matter what she does. Then she'd go and lie to our parents to get me into trouble so I'd be punished. Lies like saying I yelled at her because she wanted to talk to me to saying I walked home from school without her (we walk together). The walking home from school lie got me punished twice already. So I started putting distance between us because I'm done being a supportive sister if she's going to treat me that way and our parents are extra sensitive with her because of the bullying so they won't do anything that might upset her more like getting her to stop her crap.

This all built into a fight with my sister three weeks ago. She wanted to talk to me because she had a shitty day and I told her to go away and find someone else to listen. She told me I had to listen and I said no. She said I'm her sister and she needs me. I told her I don't fucking care and I'm not here to be her emotional punching bag. She started crying and saying I was supposed to love her no matter what. Again my reply was I didn't fucking care. I told her she got my sympathy until she started treating me like shit when I was trying to help her. I told her she wants to see me grounded, to call me names and take her problems out on me then she could forget about me supporting her. I told her I was so tired of being her sister and that I didn't give a shit about her anymore. She ended up running away after that. I had to tell our parents what happened when they realized she was gone. It took us 3 days to find her. And when she was found my parents expected me to apologize. But I didn't and they're still mad. I told them I didn't regret saying it and she might be fragile but I'm not here to take her crap. They told me I should be more understanding and kind and I should feel guilty for making her run away.

49,1g156zv,AITA for confronting my cousin because what his mom said had my mom call me crying?,"So, I (F25) have an elder cousin (M27) who is a literal pick me child. I admit that his family losses (nephew & oldest brother) took a toll on him, especially after his eldest sister turned to substances after having, and watching his mom, my aunt(who hates me) deteriorate over time because she took custody of all 3 kids.
Growing up he (M27) was very close with my younger brother, until we ended up in our dad’s mother’s custody in 2011. We grew up and grew apart, and I was the only one out of my 3 siblings who came back home. Well, my brother told me to notify said cousin that he was coming home since my cousin and I work at the same place. My brother was super excited. So, I pulled cousin aside and told him, only to be met with a very cold selfish response from him in regards to the news. I was taken aback and upset by his attitude. This cousin told me that he was going to be working and that he had no time for childish bulls**t anymore. Okay cool.
This cousin then went to his mother and lied to her saying that I screamed at her son halfway across the workplace and embarrassed him. My aunt, is also my mother’s sister. My mother is completely disabled and in a nursing home. I’m EXTREMELY protective over her since I found out about my 3rd siblings passing back in Nov. My aunt chose to call my mother and screams at her for over an hour about me embarrassing her son at work and that I need to stop harassing him. My mother called me crying and begged me to leave him alone to keep the peace. So I did, until it ate at me and ate at me until I snapped. You don’t make my mom cry and get away with it. 

So today I confronted my cousin telling him that the next time he has an issue with me to address me as an adult or keep his f**king mouth shut because if my mother calls me crying again because of his mother’s need to defend a man child that both of them will face legal issues. He then pulled me aside saying I was being childish. I said no, that my mother is sick, and i don’t need the stress being a 7 week high risk pregnant female. I’m my mother’s POA and I may be placing a no contact order between my mother and aunt for now because I no longer believe my aunts mentally okay due to her hatred of me and the loss of her son and grandson.

Yesterday at 2pm he told me he was WFH because he couldn't walk due to pain on his legs. I told him he should go to the doctor and asked if it had started that day, he said it had been getting worse for some time. I told him he needs to start seeing the doctor before it gets bad, and he left me on ""seen"".



We have free healthcare, it's not a money issue.



At 10:30pm I picked up a call from mom (59F). We usually call each other around that time. As soon as I pick up, she started asking me a bunch of questions that didn't make sense, like ""Are you at home? Did you go out? Is everything ok?"". I'm broke, plus it was a Thursday. My mom knows I rarely go out. I said ""Ofc I didn't go out, what kind of question is that? I'm ok"". She replied in a very bitter tone ""I'm asking because I called you and \[Fiancé\] and none picked up, and \*family cares\*, family asks if the others are ok, you know?"". I had a call from her 2 min before and my fiancé had a call 1 min before, but we were at the balcony and left the phones inside (we don't have a place to put them outside), so we didn't hear them. This is not something uncommon btw, she knows I don't carry my phone around all the time at home.



I told her everything was ok, I was just outside, and we picked up the phone within 5 min, so I wasn't sure what she was on about. She repeated, ""Family cares, I just wanted to know you were safe"". It sounded like there was something implied, but I know enough to know that, if she's mad about something, she won't just let me know, I'll have to figure it out. So I decided to let it go and asked her if Dad was feeling better.



She replied ""What do you mean? We're at the ER."". I asked her how was I supposed to know and she told me ""We've been here since 6pm and your dad sent you a picture of the bracelet \[those with your name and whatever they give you at hospitals\] at 8pm. And you didn't even ask about it. Family asks and cares for each other"".



Now, there are 3 situations here. 1) I work remotely, so I use WhatsApp for 90% of my job communications. 2) I also freelance, and same thing. 3) my dad sends me dozens of random memes and inspirational quotes a day that he finds on Facebook. All that said, I rarely check my phone after 7-8pm, to be able to have some rest, because I assume if something is serious, people will call. Even if I did see the notification (which I didn't), I probably wouldn't rush to open it, as I was having dinner by that time, and it was a picture sent by my dad on WhatsApp, which is something I get a LOT.



I asked my mom ""Why didn't you call when you got to the hospital instead of sending and picture?"". She told me to not turn the blame on her and now is mad that I ""didn't care"" for my dad.

51,1g146aa,AITA for asking my mum what does her voice sound like to her in her head.,"I was hanging with my mum, we were on the couch watching tv. I suddenly remembered a conversation I had with my friend last night and asked her the question that sparked the conversation. I asked her “does your voice sound lower or higher in your head when you speak?” (Edit: to be clear we were watching friends, a show we both have seen the whole way through loads of times, and we talking about other stuff before I asked this question)

I said “you’ve made me feel like I’ve asked some really invasive strange question but I don’t think I have”. Then she just answered everything I said with a very patronising “ohh ok”, “mhmm” “really?” Which I really fucking hate. 

So I got annoyed and told her she always does this shit, when I ask a simple question that I just want to speculate about and she gets all weird about it. If I asked my sister or a friend they’d just bloody answer and speculate along with me no matter what the reasonable topic is.

52,1g1434o,AITA for telling a cannabis store manager that their new hire deserves more support?,"I recently went to a weed shop I have been to a few times before.

I went in for a pickup order, turns out they put away all the items — turned out to be policy. I didn’t have issue with that because I didn’t know that and it takes 2 minutes or less  to grab the items.

I’m in the line with a girl who is a new hire, she’s frantically running around trying to run beck and forth from the computer writing down my order, she just handles 8 customers in a row during a rush, I actually moved to the side to wait since my order was messed up. I was okay waiting a bit longer esp because she’s new. So…25 minutes pass of me standing there waiting. I grew a bit frustrated just waiting and waiting while her coworkers just walked around laughing and talking. In my head I’d assume one of them could help her with the rush line or help me get my messed up order sorted. But nope. 

Anyway I’m being super patient because again this girl is a new hire and I was okay waiting — didn’t expect to stand there for 30+ minutes for 3 items but whatever, I’m trying to be understanding.

I see this girl by herself on the other side of the store away from her coworkers basically overwhelmed, stressed and seemingly drowning by herself. It was shocking to watch. Hence why I was okay waiting longer, I was tired but you know I was of the kind to either walk out and come back another time or simply wait. For example it took her 20 minutes to figure out how to print my order receipt …one coworkers gives her wrong info then the manager comes at 30 minutes later and finally prints it. Something she could’ve been helped with AGES ago. The girl looks defeated.

Anyway, fast forward she finally rings me up (I’d been standing to the side waiting for 35 minutes at this point …for a pickup order :/ — but I’m trying to give grace and patience as a person who has worked in service before.

After she rings me up, I kindly ask her to grab her manager please. I reassure her she did nothing wrong, I tell her she deserves more support and that the way she’s being treated isn’t okay. She looks terrified to grab her manager, which is a bad sign.

I am mindfully and calmly just explaining to her manager that “I just wanted to say I think this young woman could use a bit more support, I just stood there watching her and waiting for almost 40 minutes). I understand the issue with my order and also she’s new I have absolutely no issue with that. My feedback is regarding the support she could have received”. I am very very mindful of my tone, my body language, I’m speaking very calmly, being mindful to be respectful, and just concise and eloquent but honest. 

He bites back and goes “have you ever ran a million dollar business?” I look around puzzled because where did that jump come from? What does that have to do about the young lady and her getting support from coworkers including you who were just giggling in the back not helping her during a rush? I say, that essentially, he repeats that stupid phrase. And I just ask “am I being rude to you” asking that because he’s being rude. I tell him he’s being very passive aggressive while I came to him kind and respectful. He just continues to be so disrespectful, and immature. He cannot handle any feedback or critique even if it with a kind and calm tone from a repeat customer. He doesn’t own the store by the way he’s just a day manager. But he’s scribing as if he owns the business…weird.

I was just in disbelief at how rude he was to me. I don’t think he liked a woman telling him anything or giving any criticism so he lost himself. I simply just can’t have a conversation with a child, and I leave. Tempted to turn around and curse him out, but I get to my car to calm down.

Am I the asshole in this situation? Is he? Should I have not said anything to the manager or was I correct? 

I simply was frustrated waiting so long for something so simple and I was shocked at how they left that young lady new hire out to drown by herself for so long. I haven’t had bad experiences with anyone but that guy, the last time I met him I didn’t know he was the manager he was just a cashier and he was so incredibly rude to me. Just cutting me down and belittling me as someone who was very very new to any sort of cannabis.

Yeah thats last season me, I’m 18 finishing up my senior year in highschool and am burnt out. I feel like I have that mid life ‘I don’t give an f’ morality and have been cutting off toxic people left and right. I just need someone to “AH check” me because I’m starting to get numb out the “What if they change/be decent” things and no longer care.

For this post I’ll call this girl Riley (17F).

Riley reminds me of middle school me before my Covid character development mixed in with Camp Rock’s….Camp rockness. Most of the time this girl acts like a Disney character brought to life, yeah that means random dancing in the middle of the halls (twerking mostly), blasting songs and screech- I mean singing it (I loooove the looks that gives), having a harem of guys she’s ’talking’ to, and says she’ll do something like join a club/audition for theatre and take 3 months of saying ‘I’m scared’ to just move tf on.

She constantly says/does something that should end up here like anything from objectifying men to full on falling in guys laps/sniffing a guy’s shirt while rummaging in his bag/ and last but not least being interested in my brother because he’s a guy!

Guess how old- He’s 12 (I yelled at her & she denies that intention).

If you couldn’t tell I really don’t like her, sure sometimes we have decent conversations and in the end yes she’s an awkward teenage girl that is boy crazy-

But the MAIN reason I’m friends with her, is because it’s convenient and is easier than dealing with the awkwardness that comes with making an enemy.

I feel like that’s a AH move and very fake of me but the amount of times I SEE her- it just sounds like a headache.

The rest of my friends give her death glares and side eyes and say that they’ll ’be my bodyguard so I don’t have to deal with her since I am hesitating in order to say it the nicest way possible and make sure I do it so she doesn’t make a ‘I can fix us’ fantasy scenario out of this. And I get weird looks just by TALKING to her from people I’ve never even met!

This is ruining my chi, she was like “Yknow I love how you’re so much like me, it’s one of the main things I love about you” which would’ve been fine if in the next introduce your friend thing she called her friend a “a ex hood rat” and that she’s glad she grew out of it. 

So I’m thinking I would say I can’t be friends with someone that makes me uncomfortable or is hated by the rest of the people I’m friends with and I would feel fake if I can’t defend you in private (her only redeeming quality is other my bestie loving her and she’s good with parents).

55,1g13aou,AITA for asking a lady to leave the bank with her dog outside?,"Hi! It's my first time posting here, so I hope I'm doing it correctly.


Just saw a post about a guy in a elevator who fears dogs and the OP decided the guy could take it because it was just a short lift and it wouldn't hurt him. So I got reminded of something that happened to me last week.


Well, I was at the bank the other day, which is a tiny tiny space of less than 80sm (including cubicles, so like a 4-5sm space, which is really small) and this lady come in with a humongously big dog that was shedding like hell because it's fur changing time here. The lady parade it around and I went to ask her if the dog was a service dog. She asked me what that was and I answered by asking if she needs the dog with her for any medical reasons. She said no. So I proceed to explain to her that I have a quite severe allergy to dogs and told her I thought they weren't allowed in if they aren't service dogs. She threw a pissy fit and loudly exclaimed that she had to wait outside because a girl didn't like the dog. Which is not the case. I don't mind dogs and I really like some of them. They simply give me allergies. Well, when I approached the front desk, lady comes in again with the dog. At this point I'm tired as hell and I wasn't breathing properly so I ran outside.

By the time I got home, I was breaking out in hives, couldn't breathe, my whole body was swelling, etc. It took a ton of meds for me to be able to start breathing a bit better, but I still had the hives and swelling. Took two days to mildly recover from it.

Well, yesterday I saw the woman again, minus dog, going to the shops. If she can go to the shops dogless, why is she forcing her dog into a small place where the door has to be closed at all times and then has a tantrum because someone tells her they cannot be near dogs? I wasn't saying I don't like dogs, I was breaking in hives in front of her and couldn't speak properly because I couldn't breathe properly.

Was I TAH for asking her to attend least keep the dog outside? I hoped she would understand the situation, but she clearly didn't and got her dog in again the moment she saw me out of sight, even tough she knew I was still inside.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-11,"AITA for asking a lady to leave the bank with her dog outside?

56,1g127jq,WIBTA if I set this boundary with my (20s F) temporary lodger(20s F)?,"Okay I (late 20s F) just need a sanity checked on this one to make sure I'm NTA before I put my foot in it/ back down.

A friend (late 20sf) I've known for about six years has temporarily moved in with me and my partner into our home due to her living situation not working out. Since we've known her for a while, we feel fairly comfortable around her, but still struggle sharing our space to recharge. She has been here about a month now and has had her partner (late 20s m) over about 3-4 times a week, we've seen him every weekend in one way or another. He is nice enough but quite loud and wants to talk a lot. We don't really know him, have a lot going on and need a lot of time to recharge as people. He also lives with his parents, which is relevant.

The first week she moved in he was over 5 nights, she brought this up and apologised, saying he would only come over at weekends. The next week it was 4 nights, granted we didn't really see him during the week. This week he wanted to cook for us all but we already had food, he then came over at seven and took over the kitchen making food and being super loud. I was feeling really ill and annoyed my friend hadn't stuck to what she said about weekends as I needed to go in the kitchen and tidy up and having to chat felt super draining.

So, today I asked if she could start splitting her time with him at his parents at the weekends. She said she could ask but him it was hard with him living with his parents. I received a big message saying she is upset because:
A. She wants alone time with her partner without his parents there for privacy
B. Weekends are their only proper time together
C. having set time he can come over feels weird & like she is not an adult 
D. He wants a chance to get to know us and she feels this will upset him
E. She feels like a burden and like we regret letting her stay

For me, this feels like for a&b I could turn around and say, that's how I feel about my home and partner? D also feels irrelevant, forced hangouts don't make friends.

 I'm worried I WBTA because it feels like its controlling her autonomy and feels harsh or extreme, I also don't want her to feel unwelcome. But it feels like it has been affecting my partner and me to have to constantly keep our social face switched on whenever he's over, especially when we need to recharge at the weekend. It means we've both been more snappy with each other and feel more drained / overwhelmed easily. 

So WIBTA if I double down on this?

Edit: just to clarify, Im asking her to split spending weekends at his parents and mine. Not specifically because she isn't okay to stay at our house, but so we don't spend every weekend with her partner in our space

58,1g11l4r,AITA my husband prioritizing gym above our marriage and household activities ,"Okay so throwaway account just to be on the safe side. Let me first specify some things.

1. Partner started weightlifting training recently - He used to go to the gym before and workout but he started weightlifting recently and his whole personality has changed.
Ever since he started going by a schedule to weightlift, his schedule is all that matters. Everything revolves around his schedule. His work. His family life. His willingness to do chores.

As a result of which I dont have to do much chores around the house even though I step in and help out once I get back from work.
But his excuse for not stepping in and helping with chores is that he is tired, his body hurts, he has to go to gym etc etc etc. I drive 2+ hours to work and back 5 days in the week and even then I get back home and help out. He works from home most days or is back home by noon. He was play video games or sleep till its time to go to the gym and then say he forgot. He is someone who is usually forgetful but what bothers me is that if it's anything related to gym, he never forgets. He doesnt forget his schedule, he doesnt forget what he has to do at gym that day, he doesnt forget to buy all his training stuff etc. But everything else he forgets or is too tired.

I bought this up with him recently and he said "" tell me what to do and I will do it"", I said okay that time. And then continued a series of me telling him what to do and him still not doing half of those things. A week back we had another fight about it and it's the same thing. Our fights get resolved when I talk to him again and by then usually I am tired of fighting so I just give in. And past few days I have been telling him to do things and he did it. And the day I forgot to tell him what to do, he didn't do it.

Now I am just worried. We are planning to move out soon and I worry that the rest of my life I will have to list out each chore for him (chores around home usually changes so its not a strict schedule) or just end up doing it myself.

1. Partner started weightlifting training recently - He used to go to the gym before and workout but he started weightlifting recently and his whole personality has changed.
Ever since he started going by a schedule to weightlift, his schedule is all that matters. Everything revolves around his schedule. His work. His family life. His willingness to do chores.

59,1g11ibu,WIBTA If I showed my nephew Slipknot? ," UPDATE: its only been like 30 min but the answer is pretty conclusive. I will wait it out, most fun aunt duties don’t come to play until he is older anyway. Thank you for the people out there who responded kindly even when telling me I’m in the wrong I appreciate it. My intentions were good but the actual actions would not be. I’ll also be sure to keep opinions to myself in front of his parents so no undermining happens, I appreciate that being pointed out too.

Also guys i’m 20 with no children that is why I asked, I know I do not have good gauge for these things because as stated my nephew is also the only child I like. I appreciate you helping me get perspective so I can adjust what I know for future situations with him. I want to be in his life always so thank you to those of you who (KINDLY) pointed out it would be a mistake that would jeopardize that. 





I 20F have a nephew 4M who is literally the only child I like because he is the cutest sweetest little baby ever. I actually cannot talk about it too much or I’ll ramble on about how perfect he is forever. 

The Reason for my posting here is: he is starting to get into music now. Not like baby shark and nursery rhymes like actual real music. Unfortunately both of his parents are very boring default setting people. They like country so that is all he knows, It made me cringe when the little angel told me his favourite song was “Tipsy.” 

I played him one metal song before (non-explicit) and both his parents said it was weird music. They both HATE anything alternative leaning They aren’t republican or ultra religious (or really religious at all) they just like country. I just feel like it is my duty as his cool aunt to give him a chance to see all the music that is out there. And maybe also save him from having a bad music taste. The tipsy song isn’t very child appropriate so I feel like non-explicit slipknot songs should be fine too but i’m unsure. 

As much as I love him and am involved in raising him he isn’t my kid. I feel like not letting him listen because they look scary and intimidating isn’t fair. I wouldn’t make him watch any music videos or anything i’m not trying to scar him. But once again it isn’t my choice. They have never said I can’t but they were a bit scandalized when I did once before. 

I worry about the kid. Both parents want him to be a country loving sports star and he is only 3. I feel like he deserves the chance to know there is other stuff out there. I also like other music beyond metal and considered showing him that and working my way up to metal. But he already did like the one song I played for him before. 

TLDR: I want to show my nephew slipknot because his parents only play him country. They have never said I cant but also have outwardly said they dont like my music. I want to but I don’t wanna cause a gigantic drama.

Both his boyfriend and girlfriend are amazing and treat him so well. They live about an hour away and my son still gets some mail here some times. We usually hold until he has time to come pick it up, but this week he had a package that was there for almost a month. I wasn’t sure if it was anything important or something he urgently needed, like a medication. And this the part where I knew I was wrong, I decided to open it. I know this was a breach of privacy, but it felt alright at the time. 

To my surprise, it was 3 heart shaped, rhinestone butt plugs, in 3 sizes that get progressively larger.

Later that week, my son stopped by to pick up his mail and packages. I went to grab the previously opened box and I said, “I’m so sorry, I opened this one thinking it might be important…”. He could sense my discomfort and he busted out laughing. I laughed with him too, and I could tell we were both acknowledging the awkwardness. I guess I was really nervous because when I caught my breathe, I blurted out, “So who gets each size?”. My son immediately stopped laughing and it got very awkward. My son finally said, “Don’t ask me that” and awkwardly took the package and left. 

Later that day, my daughter, who still lives at home with me, asked me what I had said to my son. Apparently he was really upset with what I had said. He thought I was weirdly sexualizing his partnerships and breaching his privacy by opening private mail. 

I know I’m in the wrong for opening his mail, I feel really bad about it. I didn’t mean to make him feel bad. But I was just trying to relate to him and lighten the mood with a funny joke.

I asked my mom if we could try again and she said to wait for my birthday which was a few weeks away. Come my birthday...no laptop.(my birthday was still cool) I asked again a few days later incase it was just a surprise and she said wait until next Tuesday, come Tuesday I asked and she said wait until Thursday and come Thursday she said Saturday... obviously we didn't get it. She's starting to get irritated everything I ask so a waited longer before asking again. When I asked her tonight she said she has the laptop and will give it to me but I had to be consistent with getting to school on time for 3 weeks.

62,1g119zy,AITA for telling my parents to not include my stepdaughter in their will?,"Throw away account …

I (35f) have 2 kids (17 m/f twins) and 1 stepdaughter (18) who I met when she was 11. 

The other day, I was at my parents house going over some estate planning as I am the executor. While reviewing, I saw my folks had split their assets to be half for my 2 siblings and I and the other half for their grandkids—all to be distributed evenly. My stepdaughter was included. When I asked them about this, they said they wanted to be fair. Their estate isn’t super large, but the sum would be substantial (think new car). 

I told my parents that while generous of them, I didn’t think it would be necessary and would be better to split between their 5 grandkids. 

When we got home, my husband said he overheard what I said and that I was being an AH for alienating his daughter. 

I told him my reasoning was because she is the only child/grandchild/niece on both her parent’s sides and that she would be set. Her grandparents own multiple properties, her uncles are fairly well off and live in a HCOL area, and well, she’s the only kid and it’s not looking like (at least in his side) that she’ll have any cousins. Plus, their collective net worth is substantially more than my side. I also asked him if his parents included my kid in their estate, but he refused to answer. 

Still. He said I was being an AH and accused me of not caring about her future. I think I was doing the right thing by looking out for my kids and their cousins. AITA? 

Edit: I was told to include this in the post-

1- I didn’t argue with or pressure my parents to make a change. I simply mentioned that I don’t feel it was necessary for her to receive a monetary amount. 

2- my mom plans on giving her a set of family heirloom jewelry that is her birthstone. I think this is quite thoughtful. I’m not a big jewelry person and she has other sets for the other girls in the family so I feel this is ok. 

3- my parents have seen her about 3-5x a year since I met her.

4- my nephews and my kids do not have active relationships with their biological father sides. My niece is a new mom and works at a restaurant. I feel that financial inheritance would be more impactful for them even as such a small amount. 

5- I know my SD is set to inherit at least 2 houses in a major us city with HCOL.  I found this out a while back after my husband asked me to help him organize his office. I had to read through papers to know how to file them accordingly. The paper was a certified copy and was drafted soon after we married. My kids were not included. I am not sure if it has been updated. I did not ask him about it at the time because I did not have an issue with it. 

6- There is distance in the relationship but I don’t feel it’s my fault. I can explain this. When I met her mom for the first time, she made it very clear that I wasn’t her mom. I didn’t see this as an issue because I did not want to overstep and as a mom myself, I could see where she was coming from and respected her request. 

But as time progressed, our opportunity to spend time together became less frequent. At first my husband had every other weekend visitation. It became less frequent as she became a teenager because she wanted to spend the night with friends, hang out, etc which I see as normal teenager behavior. The other piece is that we were never invited to be included in major celebrations for her. We usually celebrated birthdays with her a week after because we weren’t invited (my husband was-just not us). She’s also never spent Thanksgiving or Christmas with us because her mom wanted those days. Again, which I saw as fine because that’s her only child. My husband would spend holidays with her at her mom’s house which I encouraged because I knew the importance of father/daughter connections. We also were not invited to her HS graduation.

63,1g117on,WIBTA if I keep (legally)trying to get vending machines to dispense doubles?,"
There is this small vending machine at sport practice, and sometimes a bag of chips is crammed behind another. They are stocked that way. So whenever you buy them, they would get stuck floating or almost tip forward because the other bag of chips would block it a bit. 

This vending machine (after people complained that it stole their money, probably), has a “vend product guarantee”. If the first time it tries to drop the chips the bags get stuck, then it’ll spin again so that the extra spin will drop the original bag of chips. 

When I bought something from the vending machine for the first time, however, I chose the bag of chips that I saw was stuck behind another bag. (Why tempt fate? It was my favourite flavour.) As predicted, it got stuck. What I didn’t realize was that the vending machine would spin again, giving me two bags of chips. I thought it was a lucky coincidence, so I gave the extra to a teammate. 

But the next time I tried it with the same strategy, it gave me two bags again. 

The time after that, it almost gave me two. But the second bag was left floating, filling me with unjustified disappointment. 

This landed me as the good luck person with vending machines. Every time I said I’d buy something, a couple of teammates would want to watch me.

Today, I was going to look at the chips to see which ones would drop a double, with the couple of teammates around me. Someone might have started cheering. 

Our coach walks by, confused as to why there’s so much commotion around a vending machine. 

“What are you doing?” 

We answer with the truth, saying we wanted two bags of chips for the price of one. 

Coach then proceeded to give a mildly disapproving speech, saying that someone worked hard to run the vending machine; we are abusing a flaw, taking away somebody’s profits, and maybe getting someone in trouble. All true points. 

My teammate says that it’s not our fault that the machine gives out doubles, and “what would we do with the extra ? Shove it back in?” Another says “we practiced so hard today we deserve extra”and “someone else would do this anyways”.

Coach, getting a bit miffed, then said that if we get an extra bag, we should give it to the front desk to ultimately give to the supplier. (I feel like the receptionist would just eat it.)

My teammates say that I should trying to get two bags, because: I’m not doing anything not allowed (all I do is pay and press the buttons. I don’t shake the machine at all, I’ve read the warning labels), and the likelihood that some big corporation manages the machine is high.

My coach is a very morally upright person. They work hard and sacrifice a lot for the team and they try to always take the high road and do what is right. I appreciate it; I just don’t know if I have enough morals to not engage in a by-the-rules loophole that benefits me. I doubt most people would give it up.

65,1g10zpv,AITA for not going with my(20M) gf(20F) to a football game?,"So for context, I go to a particular football game with my family every single year. We make a weekend out of it, get a hotel room in that city, the whole 9 yard so to speak. My girlfriend of 3 years just recently started going to this game with her family too, which has been fun as we get to meet up there in a completely different town and on the day of the game see each other, but we sit separately with our families. Well this year, her and her family were set to go and the game is this Saturday. Out of the blue they call her and tell her that they sold all of their tickets except for hers, and that she needs to find someone else to go with, as well as a ride to that city (about a 4 hour drive). Obviously she was extremely upset about this and I comforted her the best I could. I came up with the idea that she could come with me and my family to the game and they “wouldn’t leave her out.” I called my mom and explained her the situation and she basically said no. She gave excuses like “there is not enough room in the hotel for her” “this is a family thing” “she doesn’t have a ticket by us anyways” and a couple others. I can see her point with some of the excuses but it felt like she just didn’t want my gf there and she wanted it to be an immediate family only thing like it normally is. I went back to my gf and told her the news and now she is mad at me and my family, she said that “she thought she was family and that she would have a place with us” I feel like I am stuck between a rock and a hard place. What do I do? I don’t know how to resolve this without hurting either my family or my girlfriend. 

For context, my parents bought my ticket to the game, they also stated this in a text to me after saying goodnight
“You just do what u want buddy. And let me know what u decide. We are sticking to our plan over here and if you go with us that’s great and if you go with GF I’ll understand.”

66,1g10yy8,AITA for shutting off my ex's utilities?,"My Ex and I separated about 3 and a half months ago.



After I'd moved out, I provided her with the utility account numbers as a temporary fix until she could have the accounts transferred over to her.



Just for context, it probably hasn't been super easy for her and part of that is my fault. I'm not super proud of this, but I stopped by and dropped off some snacks a couple of weeks later, with a lengthy letter explaining how I felt and asking her to start over and try again with me. I asked her to take some time to think about it and get back to me. No response. I guess that was her response, in a way. What can I say? I was deeply depressed and still hopeful for a fresh start with her.



Getting back on track, I assumed that everything had been attended to, as far as the bills go, because I thought that she was an independent adult. Yet, a charge appeared on my bank statement from our internet service provider again (previously, it was on my card, we just split the bill). When I say again, I mean that the first month I'd left, I was accidently charged, but the following month, I wasn't charged by them, so I assumed everything was in order. I texted her to let her know about it - no response.



After some digging, I realized that the gas bill hadn't been paid. So, I notify her and attempted to communicate with her, getting a range of sparse, to passive aggressive, and even non-responses. So, because of how she was handling this and how she was ignoring me now, I scheduled services to stop.



Finally, I get a nastygram this morning informing me that I'm going to get stuck with the gas bill and that, thanks to her electricity being scheduled for shut-off, that she's going to come home from work to find her fish dead (she made it a point to mention she'd gotten after I'd moved out), and for me to have a nice life. I did send some responses but I doubt she even read them. Or if she did, she hasn't responded.



I knew going into it this was just emotionally manipulative BS, but I have to admit that it worked because I did feel bad for the fish and her as well, to be honest. I know I shouldn't feel bad, but I do. I called the electric company and had the shut-off rescheduled until after the weekend.



I guess after all this time, after screwing me out of what's going to be about a $200 gas bill, along with a bunch of other things (probably the electric bill now too), I still care about her. I know that extending the electric usage isn't going to bring her back to me, that she'll never thank me for it, and that she probably hates me. I have no illusions about any of that. She and I were together for 10, almost 11 years and as much as I try to banish it from my heart, I still love her.

I have expressed as much to my family & am waiting to get diagnosed on my own insurance. I also work as a ASM in retail. I like my job, but my social battery drained by the night. I also haven't been sleeping lately.

So today was really rough at work. And when I called my mom's cell when I got off I asked them if they needed anything on my way home. List secured, I ran to the grocery store. While there I was wondering if there was still any of the food I'd bought for myself in the fridge. 

This time I called the house phone, and the person in the  other  end didn't sound like anyone who lives in my house. I asked them if they could check the fridge and then asked who if I was speaking to someone I asked who it was and  they said it!s me, I figured one of them (probably my mom) was putting on a voice. I asked them specifically who it was, incredibly frustrated, and they answered, ""well you called my house you should know who it is.""

71,1g10exi,"WIBTA if I asked my mother to let her children inherit her properties instead of starting a ""memorial fund""?","My sister and I are in our early 20s. We are middle class, live at home with our single mother a first generation migrant who has worked hard to support us.

My sister and I have both never got into trouble, we are in long term relationships and have entry level jobs in our chosen careers straight out of university. We bought our own cars, paying off our own university loans. Years ago, she sat us down individually and told us she would divide up her assets equally between us before she passed away. 

A couple weeks ago she told me she had some other thoughts. She basically said, now that we are adults and have jobs in our country, we have become ""successful"", and we don't need her help anymore. She also wants to be remembered for generations so she is going to sell everything and use the money that she receives to donate to the church to set up a memorial fund and maybe get a statue in her name.

She said if she gave us her properties we might sell them and no one would even know about her. I was kinda floored when I heard this and I didn't know what to say. She seemed excited at the idea and eager for our approval.

I don't know what could have caused her change of mind. The only thing I could think of, is that over the past 10 years my mother has become increasingly involved in the church. My mother is a born again Christian but neither my sister nor I are religious. We have never said it outright to her but I think she knows since she's always preaching to convince us. Maybe she thinks we're sinners and not going to heaven so what's the point of leaving us with anything? Maybe it's the idea of not focusing on worldly possessions?

I just feel like everything my mother has worked towards since she had us is to build us up to have a better life and this seems like a complete 180.

I am a bit offended because it feels like she doesn't trust we will use her assets for good, like we'll just blow it all on coke and hookers. We live in a country with a huge cost of living and rental crisis, and I would be more than happy to be able to move out in one of her properties. I am confused why she would rather be ""remembered"" than to want to support our lives. Our father is out of the picture and has made it clear his step wife will be inheriting everything, so neither of us will be inheriting anything from anyone.
But the thing is, I honestly don't think her assets will be worth enough to fund anything long term. If I was being more critical, I don't trust that the church will handle her money appropriately at all. I'm thinking of raising these concerns with her.

It seems like the consensus is that where your parent's money goes is their decision to make and that trying to change their mind for your benefit is an entitled asshole thing to do. I feel like my situation is a bit different though because we had agreed on a different plan. WIBTA?",No A-holes here,2024-10-11,"WIBTA if I asked my mother to let her children inherit her properties instead of starting a ""memorial fund""? My sister and I are in our early 20s. We are middle class, live at home with our single mother a first generation migrant who has worked hard to support us.

My sister and I have both never got into trouble, we are in long term relationships and have entry level jobs in our chosen careers straight out of university. We bought our own cars, paying off our own university loans. Years ago, she sat us down individually and told us she would divide up her assets equally between us before she passed away. 

A couple weeks ago she told me she had some other thoughts. She basically said, now that we are adults and have jobs in our country, we have become ""successful"", and we don't need her help anymore. She also wants to be remembered for generations so she is going to sell everything and use the money that she receives to donate to the church to set up a memorial fund and maybe get a statue in her name.

She said if she gave us her properties we might sell them and no one would even know about her. I was kinda floored when I heard this and I didn't know what to say. She seemed excited at the idea and eager for our approval.

I don't know what could have caused her change of mind. The only thing I could think of, is that over the past 10 years my mother has become increasingly involved in the church. My mother is a born again Christian but neither my sister nor I are religious. We have never said it outright to her but I think she knows since she's always preaching to convince us. Maybe she thinks we're sinners and not going to heaven so what's the point of leaving us with anything? Maybe it's the idea of not focusing on worldly possessions?

I just feel like everything my mother has worked towards since she had us is to build us up to have a better life and this seems like a complete 180.

I am a bit offended because it feels like she doesn't trust we will use her assets for good, like we'll just blow it all on coke and hookers. We live in a country with a huge cost of living and rental crisis, and I would be more than happy to be able to move out in one of her properties.

72,1g102vt,"AITA for choosing to jump into the swimming lane with two people instead of the lane with one?
","My gym has three swimming lanes. When I went today, all three were taken. Left lane was a guy swimming laps, middle lane was four younger people playing in the water and the right lane was two older guys slowly walking back and forth. I chose to go into the lane with the two guys. 

I sat on the ledge and waited for them to get near but they never got close enough to speak with so I made eye contact, smiled, nodded at them to let them know I was joining their lane and then jumped into the pool. 

When we passed each other, one of the guy stops me and says,  
Guy: Hey, why don’t you go to the other lane? It’s one guy by himself.  
Me: Oh, he’s swimming laps so I didn’t want to get in his way.  
Guy: Well, do you think it makes any sense that there’s only one guy in that lane and there’s three of us here?  
Me: It’s okay. You guys are just walking and I’m just doggy paddling.  
Guy: It’s not fair, you should go over there.  
Me: It’s NOT that big of an problem.

I rolled my eyes and continued swimming. We ended up going opposite directions so when we turned around and met again, I went to my right, assuming that he would scoot over to the middle to give me a little space to swim by. Nope, he did not move at all. By this point, my neck was literally touching the lane line as I tried getting out of his way. He walked right into me and gave me a hard nudge. It took everything in me not kick him as I swam by, I settled with just saying “FU\*KER\*

Like I said, they were walking super slow so when I turned around, I had already caught up with them before they even reached the end of the pool. He saw me coming behind me so he purposely turned around, right into me and blocked me again. I yet again could only utter ""FU\*KER"". By this point, I was over it so I was going to move over to the lane with the four people. I swam past them and jumped over to the other lane, looked at him and said “HAPPY? F’in asshole.”

Not even five minutes, they left the pool and went into the hot tub.

74,1g0z7ni,AITA for claiming my gf sounded like a “Fat Albert” character when she made a funny voice?,"God even writing this out feels seriously stupid.

For context I (M28, White) and my girlfriend (F27, Mixed race Trinidadian and White) were ordering door dash. She’s looking at the options at a grocery store and found a new ice cream flavor that sounded good to her. I can’t even remember exactly what she said, but something along the lines of “I’m so excited for this ice cream”. But when she said it she made a voice that sounded incredibly similar to a Bill Cosby impression. It immediately made me think of the Fat Albert show that I watched a bunch of as a kid that Bill Cosby does multiple voices on.

So I said through a laugh, “When you find a dessert you like you almost sound like a Fat Albert character”.

Cue silence and tension. 

Next comes an argument about how what I said made her extremely uncomfortable, and that I as a white person should be more racially sensitive toward caricatures of POC. 

I tried to explain to her that to me, personally, race was not a factor in what I had just said. She made a voice that invoked a memory of a cartoon I watched as a kid, and I thought it was funny. But she wasn’t having it. She lectured me about how it isn’t my place to make such a reference, and that any POC would have been offended by what I said. And the fact that I didn’t see it was just my white privilege at play. 

Usually I’m pretty on the ball with this stuff, I consider myself a decent person most of the time and would never intentionally disrespect anyone on the grounds of race, gender, sexuality, or creed. But it was such a quick and innocent thought that popped into my head I couldn’t let it go when my character was called into question. I tried to defend myself in that it was misinterpreted on her end, but she would not let up that I needed to work on myself and reflect on why I *wouldn’t* think that’s an offensive thing to say.

I really don’t know here, some of the things she said were completely valid and had me questioning myself. But at the same time, is the basis of this argument that I as a white person can not reference something from another races culture? And who is to say what is categorized as belonging to a specific race? Maybe that sounds ignorant, but I grew up in NYC. When I watched the Fat Albert show as a kid I didn’t think “this is a black show”. I just related to these characters who lived in neighborhoods that looked just like mine. To me they were just people. Had she done a voice that sounded more like Tom Kenny when she got excited, I probably would have said “you sounded just like SpongeBob”. Again, outside of the context of the show, it doesn’t matter who the characters are or where they lived, the voice just reminded me of something specific so I referenced it.

I’m completely willing to hear out both sides of the argument, because I do try to educate myself on the injustices of the world and make sure that I am not contributing to them. But this just didn’t feel like an “injustice” to me. Maybe I’m wrong, you tell me.

75,1g0ytxh,AITA for not paying my (soon to be ex) roommates more rent after I’ve moved out,"Hi, so I currently have two roommates. Our lease expired over a year ago, therefore making us month to month. I've been trying to buy a house since April (have had 5 offers that didn't get accepted). Both roommates knew about this and I gave them updates every step of the way. I legally only owe 30 days notice, but I told them I'd do my best to give them two months so they had more time to figure out their plan for once I leave.

September 1st I tour a house that is for sale by owner and they want to sell it to me. September 4th I am under contract. They know all of this. September 9th is the inspection and it goes well. I tell them this immediately, that I am going to buy it. I let them know I will be moved out by November 1st. 

Despite the fact that they've both known since April that I have been trying to buy a house, they never talked about it with each other, if they wanted to find a new roommate or continue living just the two of them. After we meet and talk about my plan, one roommmate gives me the silent treatment for a week and then tells me they are so hurt because they believe I gave them less then 60 days and they say that it would be fair for me to pay rent for at least half of November (but not get to keep my stuff there longer) because they cannot afford paying more for that month if they are still looking for a third roommate, and so they want me to pay to make it affordable for them even though I am now also responsible for a mortgage.

They refuse to live with anyone under 30 and refuse to post on Facebook housing groups looking for a new roommate. And they are saying it's so uncaring and disappointing for me to not offer them more money even though I will be moved out. They believe that if we were on a lease (which we are not) I would be penalized for giving official notice 9 days late and so they want me to pay that to them. Which is not relevant bc we are not on a lease and so I owe 30 days.

Which ... I notified my actual landlord and all he said was congrats we will miss having you as a tenant!

Basically I have given my roommates much more than what is legally required by me (including emotional space for their feelings and tears about me moving out) but am I the asshole for not offering to pay rent longer since I was 8 days short of the 60 days I had hoped to give them?

77,1g0yahg,AITA for telling my dad the truth when he complained about taking care of my mom?,"**I do not give permission for my post to be used or shared on any other social media platform.**

 I (42 F) am an only child.  My dad was horrifically verbally abusive. This is important for our story.

My mom (78 F) is in the early stages of dementia. She lives with my dad (81 M) who is of sound (and **exceptionally angry**) mind.  I do not think he is providing for her well right now, so I am taking steps with my wife (40 F) to move my mother in with us.

For backstory, my father yells.  *Screams,* to be accurate. I had a routine of hiding in my closet while my dad would tear into my mom, shouting until he could barely speak. I don't know how my neighbors didn't call the cops or CPS or something. Anyway, this explains how I grew up and brings us to the other day at my parents' house. 

My mom's been having some accidents at night. I found out she was experiencing concussion symptoms as she had **fallen down the stairs and hit her head...** but my dad refused to call an ambulance/hospital/doctor because it was too big of an inconvenience! I knew nothing about this, and it happened over a week ago! 

Then he admitted she might be acting ""funny"" because she hadn't been taking her pills. I went through everything and found full bottles, but not *taking.* My dad just shrugged and kept watching TV. 

The final straw was her nutrition. Both of them are type 2 diabetics, and they eat whatever they want. I asked what she usually eats, and he said she's never hungry, so he doesn't know.

With her standing **right there,** he complained her interrupting his sleep. He's retired with no responsibilities, but he's furious that he's expected to get up to assist her. 

Now she is suddenly, and *""totally unprovokedly""* getting angry/yelling *at HIM* during these episodes! She's been snapping at him, saying she should have divorced him years ago and she can't believe how he's treating her after the years she tended to his health!

Then **this man had the gall to ask me what he ever did that was *sooo bad* that *he* should be spoken to in such a way...** and, welp, here's where I may be the asshole, Reddit:

I said maybe she finally had enough and decided to stand up for herself. Maybe his screaming and shredding her nerves met its expiration date, and I was glad she was standing up for herself.

Well. He lost his *SHIT* and said he understands his place, that he was NEVER ONCE appreciated. 

After getting my mom some actual dinner, I left. 

I called the next day to see if she took her pills. Before I ended the call I told him I didn't want to fight and I loved him. He said he knows where he stands and hung up. 

We are taking her soon and arranging daytime care. She also has several doctor's appointments lined up.

But, did I go too far? I don't think he's capable of taking responsibility or ownership of his abuse. He sees himself as infallible. Am I the asshole for telling the truth when I could have just *pretended* for the sake of peace?

Thank you for reading this.


Edit: It's happening. I'll be officially moving Mom in at 10am! I was able to get a hold of her neighbor who will be home so I am not alone when I get her. My wife is joining us when she returns from work, and Mom will have her first doctor's checkup at 3pm. Whew. She has an eye exam next week, dental check before the end of the month, and she will start daily care on Tuesday of next week. 

I have not had a civil conversation with my dad. 

Edit 2: The transition was very easy. She already had her things folded up neatly, and she even had her pill bottles/cases in a big Ziplock freezer bag. She ate lunch and she's taking a nap now.

For backstory, my father yells.  *Screams,* to be accurate. I had a routine of hiding in my closet while my dad would tear into my mom, shouting until he could barely speak. I don't know how my neighbors didn't call the cops or CPS or something. Anyway, this explains how I grew up and brings us to the other day at my parents' house. 

My mom's been having some accidents at night. I found out she was experiencing concussion symptoms as she had **fallen down the stairs and hit her head...** but my dad refused to call an ambulance/hospital/doctor because it was too big of an inconvenience! I knew nothing about this, and it happened over a week ago! 

Then he admitted she might be acting ""funny"" because she hadn't been taking her pills. I went through everything and found full bottles, but not *taking.* My dad just shrugged and kept watching TV. 

The final straw was her nutrition. Both of them are type 2 diabetics, and they eat whatever they want. I asked what she usually eats, and he said she's never hungry, so he doesn't know.

With her standing **right there,** he complained her interrupting his sleep. He's retired with no responsibilities, but he's furious that he's expected to get up to assist her. 

Now she is suddenly, and *""totally unprovokedly""* getting angry/yelling *at HIM* during these episodes! She's been snapping at him, saying she should have divorced him years ago and she can't believe how he's treating her after the years she tended to his health!

Then **this man had the gall to ask me what he ever did that was *sooo bad* that *he* should be spoken to in such a way...** and, welp, here's where I may be the asshole, Reddit:

I said maybe she finally had enough and decided to stand up for herself. Maybe his screaming and shredding her nerves met its expiration date, and I was glad she was standing up for herself.

Well. He lost his *SHIT* and said he understands his place, that he was NEVER ONCE appreciated. 

After getting my mom some actual dinner, I left. 

I called the next day to see if she took her pills. Before I ended the call I told him I didn't want to fight and I loved him. He said he knows where he stands and hung up. 

We are taking her soon and arranging daytime care. She also has several doctor's appointments lined up.

But, did I go too far? I don't think he's capable of taking responsibility or ownership of his abuse. He sees himself as infallible. Am I the asshole for telling the truth when I could have just *pretended* for the sake of peace?

Thank you for reading this.


Edit: It's happening. I'll be officially moving Mom in at 10am! I was able to get a hold of her neighbor who will be home so I am not alone when I get her. My wife is joining us when she returns from work, and Mom will have her first doctor's checkup at 3pm. Whew. She has an eye exam next week, dental check before the end of the month, and she will start daily care on Tuesday of next week. 

I have not had a civil conversation with my dad. 

Edit 2: The transition was very easy. She already had her things folded up neatly, and she even had her pill bottles/cases in a big Ziplock freezer bag. She ate lunch and she's taking a nap now. One of my cats is curled up with her. Whew. Doctor's appointment coming up soon. ",0.0,0.01066585,0,1

I said I'd ask my dad. After school, I called him and asked if I could stay for Homework Club (a coverup for Pride Club because my dad is homophobic.) Apparently, the Pride Club supervision staff member guy didn't come outside where he was supposed to meet us, so we assumed it was canceled (and later confirmed). My friend takes the bus, but it already left and the late bus didn't come until 4:00 PM. It was currently around 2:15. I decided that since my dad said I could go to the club, he wouldn't mind if I stayed with my friend until the bus came. So we waited for a bit at the front of the school for about 30 minutes. Then there was a swarm of flying ants and gnats or something so we moved to the side of the school and waited longer. 

Eventually, we got bored and my friend suggested that we could explore around the area. I said sure. We started walking around and he found a Lutheran school around the corner and my friend again suggested we looked around there. We headed over, but as we were crossing the road, very carefully I might add, my dad's car was coincidentally right there. He stopped me on the side of the road and told me to get in the car after screaming at my friend, thinking it was his fault and that he brainwashed me into going with him.

I told him nothing but the truth as we were driving back home. He didn't believe me and thought that I was lying. When we got home, I went straight upstairs to cry and I texted my friend about what I said to my dad, etc. Later, both my parents' came into my room and talked to me about how the Lutheran school was private property (which neither of us were aware of) and that by crossing a major road, I could've got hit by a car.

He grew up on a farm and apparently his family always drank it straight from the cow, and he's been doing the same ever since we moved in together.

At first I didn’t think much of it (being a vegan I never drank it myself) but I started doing some research after I saw the label on it literally says ""not for human consumption"". Apparently raw milk can carry harmful bacteria like salmonella, E. coli, and listeria. I freaked out when I read that, I don't want him to get sick or expose me to something dangerous.

So, when I saw a fresh bottle of raw milk in our fridge yesterday I panicked and poured the entire bottle down the drain. I thought it was the safest thing to do.

When my boyfriend got home he immediately noticed and was pissed. He said he spent a lot of money on that milk and that he’s been drinking it for years without a problem. He accused me of not trusting him and said I had no right to throw away something he enjoys just because I disagree with it. I tried explaining that I was just concerned for his health and ours, but he said I was being a ""control freak"". Now he's barely talking to me and I feel like there’s this huge distance between us.

That resident was reasonably upset, and i had to have the tough conversation of ""You can think it, but you can't say it!"" 

Today, i took a 15-minute break in my office and decided towards the end of said break that i would spend some time updating my papers for the coming week. She had walked into my office as i had just sat down on my break, left, and then came back 20 minutes later as i was getting up to go to my last room of the day. (*also should mention that some directors had made complaints about housekeepers sitting in the laundry rooms chit chatting instead of working. Sue was one of them. She had already been talked to about it.)

Sue: You're still in here taking a break?
Me: No. I was working on papers.
Sue: Look who's being lazy now!
Me: Excuse me?
Sue: Look. Who's. Being. Lazy. Now.
Me: i heard you the first time. You do understand how incredibly rude that is, right? Not to mention that i'm technically your supervisor and could write you up for that, which i'm not going to because i'm not an a-hole.
Sue: Well, what are you doing in your office this long?
Me: it's really none of your business, but i was working on my papers for next week because i have a bunch of new move ins and wanted it updated. Sue, you really need to watch what you say and who you say it to, because it can get you in trouble if you say it to the wrong person.
Sue: *storms off as she says* Well, i just don't want you to get yelled at for sitting around.
Me: *speaking loudly* Well, it's not your place to tell me that i need to get off my butt. It's the directors place. 

Later on, she storms by, mumbling, ""i'm so sick of this ish, i need to find me a new job! Tired of her ish.""

I could tell my boss was exasperated with Sue too, but she agreed. I haven't heard anymore about it. I'm sure she went and told the other housekeeper how i was being a B to her and how she was going to go and find herself another job.
I want her to understand that in a professional setting such as work, you can not just shoot off at the mouth and expect everything to be hunky dory after. She wasn't smirking or smiling when she called me lazy. She was being 100% serious.

Those who are “too” independent or estranged from their families are often looked down upon. In school, im taking pretty hard classes that take up all of my time and Im going to be joining some clubs pretty soon and my mom also wants me to get a job and volunteer all at the same time because my dream univeristy is one in D.C. (Like an hour away) but that one has a pretty low acceptance rate so she asked me what I would do if i wasnt accepted. I said id apply to other unis in DC and if I didnt get accepted into those Id apply to 3 other colleges in my state that are really good. Problem is, DC is super close to me while all those other unis are hours away. I have already been told I’m not allowed to go to dorms or move out until I get married.

My mom got superrr mad at me when she heard that those farther away unis were my next choices because of course, im not allowed to leave according to her.

In Middle School I met my online friend of 2-3 years on TikTok, we talk on Discord and bond over similar interests. I've vented to him about a few things and one of those things involves my white friend who I'll call Vee. Vee and I met in Elementary through mutual friends, my relationship with her was good at the time. I also have a friend who I'll call Em, she was my best friend in Elementary, she is also white. 

One day, Em and I had the idea to pretend to be twins during lunch, we were kids, so twinning to us meant eating the same lunches, which is what we did. We both got a PB&J sandwich for lunch. When we sat to eat we were telling Vee and one of our other friends that we were twins. Vee speaks up and tells us we can't be twins because I'm too dark skinned, I'm not sure what she said verbatim, but it was along those lines.

I started crying for the rest of lunch and as soon as I got out onto the blacktop for recess, I immediately ran to tell my teacher, who we both had. She got in trouble and was told to apologize but that apology didn't mend our friendship. What I did next, I know is wrong, but I was still a kid. I told people we knew about what Vee did some people sided with me and some stayed on the fence.

Years later, we share multiple classes in Middle School and it starts to seem like we're friends again. This is around the time I met my friend that I'll call K, we started talking around April and we really bonded over art and Gacha games, interests we both share. I have had 3-4 therapists in my life because I deal with Anxiety, Depression and a more recent diagnosis, ADD. I have told only one therapist about this incident so when I told K, I was surprised myself. I suppose it was because he didn't know me so I felt comfortable to share my experience.

Vee didn't like that though, the summer before I moved away from my home and was about to start fresh in a new area and a new High School, I told her. Vee also has Discord so I suggested letting her meet K, but I said he probably wouldn't like her much, she was confused and asked why. I told her that I explained what happened between us to him and she got mad at me. I don't think that she had a reason to be as angry as she did but I do feel bad. She wrote a long paragraph about how she was just a kid and no one taught her about that kind of stuff, even though we learn that in history, but I digress.

She blocked me after that without letting me explain or apologize. But now I'd like to know, am I in the wrong?

86,1g1m78x,AITA if I (M30) gave my hair spray bottle to my sister (F42) instead of asking my girlfriend (F25) if she wanted it first?,"
My girlfriend mentioned me that she was upset because I did not consider her to give that hair spray I bought for myself more than a year ago (even before we started dating) to her before offering them to my sister whom mentioned long ago she would like hair spray like the one I bought. 

She then started rattling about how uneducated (I think she meant inconsiderate) I was because I am suppose to ask her first if she wanted something first even if I know the answer would be no. The problem got bigger with her saying that I am always like this etc. but I don't really see the problem here as in many times before if I am the owner of the stuff I give away. Am I wrong to think that way?

Here is my thought: I would considerate her in this case if we bought the spray together and neither of us used it. Perhaps considerated her if she mentioned that she used or she liked or wanted the spray but she never EVER mentioned any of it. 

I know the spray bottle is a small thing but this could transfer to other similar problems in the future but I always leave space for if I am in the wrong.

88,1g1lvxg,AITA for not being interested in attending my mother’s wedding? ,"Hi y’all! So, I’m gonna try to make this short and simple. My (24F) mother (44F) is about to have her third wedding in a couple of weeks. I’m not interested in attending. I won’t include much context, because I’m afraid the post will get banned for being interpersonal conflict, but I’m very minimal contact with her to start with. I had planned on dropping contact completely after the wedding. But, she asked me months ago to walk her down the aisle because my grandpa refused to do it for the third time. I hedged and told her I’d have to see if I could get off work. Luckily, I was scheduled to work the weekend of the wedding. I work a job in healthcare that has rotating weekends, so I didn’t have to be dishonest. I do, in fact, have to work. And that’s just what I told her. 

The problem is that she’s now threatening to cancel the wedding and throwing a whole fit because I can’t come. I wasn’t planning on attending anyway. We aren’t close, and I wanted this to be a nice, clean break. But she’s blaming me for being the reason that she has to cancel the wedding. She’s pulling in my friends to try to get them to make me talk to her, and she’s really laying on the guilt thick. Am I the asshole for not trying to get off work to go? I know I’d be miserable if I went, and I’ve never even met her fiancé’s family. I won’t know most of the people there, and I just generally don’t want to be around her. But she’s throwing a tantrum about me not coming, and she’s even threatening to go to social media and “call me out” for being a “bad daughter”. Am I? 


Edit to Add: I’m at work so I can’t reply to comments, so I thought I’d go ahead and add this in here. I have already cut contact with my mother. She asked me this question in the beginning of the year, and I’ve since completely cut contact and have her blocked. She knows I wasn’t going to be attending the wedding. I don’t live with her, and she’s known for a few months that I wouldn’t be there, and that she’s not to contact me. But since it’s so close now, she’s starting to message people around me threatening them if I don’t talk to her. She’s even sent police to my place for a “welfare check” claiming she was concerned for my safety. I had to explain to them that I am, in fact, okay, and that I’d just contact with her and that’s why she’s making a fuss. The social media thing bothers me solely because I have people who support her messaging me attacking my character for “abandoning my mother”, and it’s making me feel insecure and guilty. Everyone who knows me knows that this was inevitable with our relationship, but her friends and people who don’t know me well are coming out of the woodwork to message me. I just want to know if the guilt I’m feeling is warranted, since the wedding is so close and people are telling me for the sake of family harmony, I should try to call off or get my shift switched so I can be there to support her.

My sister has a history of not paying people back, including me but it was smaller things like restaurants so I let it go. I knew this and wanted to put my card down for the hotel, food etc and have my bridesmaids pay me back. But my best friend said she would because it’s not right for a bride to do it. I thought there was no way my sister wouldn’t pay her back, I thought shame would make her do it so I agreed. 

We got a 2 bedroom suite and it was 2 nights in Vegas. We agreed to split everything. I paid my portion as well and each person owed $600 not including flights. What I didn’t know was my sister asked my best friend if she could put her flight on her card as well because she was maxed out on her credit card. I did not know this and my best friend thought it wasn’t a big deal. So my sister now owes my best friend $800.

She admitted she didn’t want to tell me because she was suppose to handle everything but my sister has not replied to any of her communications. 

I asked my sister who said she was broke and told me to please smooth things over with my best friend. I have no idea how I’m just suppose to convince her $800 loss is ok.

I told her she can come as a guest but as being a bridesmaid is expensive then she doesn’t have to be one. She got mad and said it would be humiliating if she showed up as a guest and told our mom. My mom said I should just cover the cost but let her be a bridesmaid for the sake of us being family. I’m conflicted because I did do a Vegas bachelorette but my sister never told me she is broke.

92,1g1kvib,AITA for getting a cat despite my brother in laws severe allergy ,"Hi redditors,

Throwaway just in case.

My sister and brother in law have been married for quite some time, and been together for as long as I can remember. I truly see him as a real brother and part of our family. Wouldn’t change him for anything!

However, lately our bond has been quite strained. I will be moving into my own place soon with my boyfriend and next to looking forward to living with my bf (who I love very much) getting a pet cat is another thing I am super looking forward to.

My childhood cat died a couple years ago and I was devastated. I mourned for a very long time and still miss him to this day. Despite the loving family he grew up in, Having a cat was quite complicated, as my brother in law has a severe cat allergy which required my mom to clean the house completely daily and the cat had to be outside at all times when he came to visit. His allergy is super severe and while he might not die like someone with a nut allergy would from eating a nut, ofcourse we want to avoid people not being able to see from the swollen face or have trouble breathing from cat fur.

This is the issue now. As I am living closer to the day of getting a new cat when I have my own place and enjoying silly cat shenanigans again, my family has grown angry at the fact that I am even considering getting a cat. I’ll be moving to the city so most likely an apartment and with no option for the cat to roam outside when my brother in law comes to visit. They are taking it as if I announced a planned poisoning in his Christmas dinner and have absolutely no respect for him.

I promised to do what I can so he can visit us as well, but I’m not delusional to the fact that I’ll never be able to provide him a comfortable visit for as long as we don’t have a place less busy where the cat can hang out in the garden from time to time.  

The feeling of not getting a cat makes me feel very sad, as I know I’ll definitely still feel the empty feeling I still have today. I just like to have a furry friend to cuddle up with. But I also don’t want to create the impression like I don’t respect and value my brother in law.

So Reddit, AITA here? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-11,"AITA for getting a cat despite my brother in laws severe allergy  Hi redditors,

Throwaway just in case.

My sister and brother in law have been married for quite some time, and been together for as long as I can remember. I truly see him as a real brother and part of our family. Wouldn’t change him for anything!

However, lately our bond has been quite strained. I will be moving into my own place soon with my boyfriend and next to looking forward to living with my bf (who I love very much) getting a pet cat is another thing I am super looking forward to.

My childhood cat died a couple years ago and I was devastated. I mourned for a very long time and still miss him to this day. Despite the loving family he grew up in, Having a cat was quite complicated, as my brother in law has a severe cat allergy which required my mom to clean the house completely daily and the cat had to be outside at all times when he came to visit. His allergy is super severe and while he might not die like someone with a nut allergy would from eating a nut, ofcourse we want to avoid people not being able to see from the swollen face or have trouble breathing from cat fur.

This is the issue now. As I am living closer to the day of getting a new cat when I have my own place and enjoying silly cat shenanigans again, my family has grown angry at the fact that I am even considering getting a cat. I’ll be moving to the city so most likely an apartment and with no option for the cat to roam outside when my brother in law comes to visit. They are taking it as if I announced a planned poisoning in his Christmas dinner and have absolutely no respect for him.

I promised to do what I can so he can visit us as well, but I’m not delusional to the fact that I’ll never be able to provide him a comfortable visit for as long as we don’t have a place less busy where the cat can hang out in the garden from time to time.

","I(24F) have been best friends with Emily (26F) for years. We usually have a great time together, but lately, things have been weird. The last time we went out, Emily told me I needed to start dressing ""classy"" if I ever wanted to get a boyfriend. She said no guy would take me seriously if I kept wearing casual clothes like I do.

The thing is, the outfits she’s suggesting are way out of my budget. I can’t afford the designer clothes and expensive looks she’s into. I explained this to her, but she just shrugged and said I was being ""unserious"" and that I needed to ""invest in myself.""

That comment really hurt. It made me feel like she was judging me for not being able to afford the same lifestyle. Since then, I’ve been avoiding going out with her, and now she’s upset that I keep saying no to plans.

ANYWAY, the surgery was about an hour long plus 2 hours recovery, my husband (33M) was welcome to stay with me until I was taken in and welcome to join me in recovery, but his mum has started a TMS therapy for her anxiety (Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a procedure that uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain to improve symptoms of major depression. It's called a ""noninvasive"" procedure because it's done without using surgery or cutting the skin.). The therapy is about a hours drive away from us in the major city so he's been taking her x4 days a week since she started it because she isn't allowed to drive afterwards, I asked hubby to please ask her to organise someone else to take her because I really wanted him with me since I was anxious about this surgery (definitely don't want more children but was also anxious at the thought of now it's near impossible to have another). He wouldn't, so he dropped me off and waited until I was taken into the preparing area, then he left to go to her house, I got a text about an hour later saying ""mums TMS got cancelled because the clinicians called in sick"". So i thought oh awesome now he can come be with me instead of leaving me alone and anxious. (Heart rate sky-rocketed so I was given nearly 20mg of diazepam to calm me down), he said no he's just going to chill at home because he didn't want to wait around bored, which fair enough but he could have easily stayed with me until I went in then go to the cafeteria and gotten food while he waited but again he said no.

I (25m) live at home with my mum (54F) and my younger (23m) and older (32m) brother

My older brother lost his job in January after his company found out that he has a drug driving record after they held another background check (he worked in project management at the time and one of the clients he was involved in a project for requested a background check for those involved i think).

Since then, he has lived between our house and his girlfriends house (more often at his girlfriends house e.g. 2.5/3weeks spent at his girlfriend’s house in a month) and is currently collecting benefits whilst applying for jobs. He has also as a result stopped contributing towards the rent for our house as he can no longer afford to do so (he was paying £400 a month, the same as me).

My room in our house is by far the smallest compared to my younger brothers, mothers and my older brothers room (even though I pay the most rent out of the brothers), in which it is not even big enough to fit in a desk to carry out my work duties. I often find myself having to go to their rooms when they are not in or even the living room to hold client meetings (which can be really distracting due to the background chatter/cooking in the nearby kitchen or them re-entering their rooms for something)

Since my older brother is not in his room as much (and the fact that he is not paying for rent in the house), I suggested that we switch rooms based on these reasons as i figured it wouldn’t be a problem and I need it more due to my work.

However, he was completely against it as he still feels entitled to it. 

Due to my personal belief of the situation being unfair to myself as I am paying the most out of the brothers but have the room with the least facilities as well as the fact that I am not able to work to the best ability in my current situation, I’ve been seriously considering moving out to a house share/room to rent elsewhere.

I am currently on 50k a month (bonuses bring me towards 58-60k annually) and live in London, and I believe that an Ensuite room in London (zone 4-6) with a desk that costs around 800-1100 a month including bills can be found as well as fit within my budget whilst also allowing me to save for a deposit on my own place someday.

However, if I was to move out, my mother would not be able to afford the rent on solely my younger brothers contribution and as such we would all have to move out, and my older brother would have no choice but to move in with his girlfriend as he would not be able to afford his own place (which I would feel guilty for).

My mum would most likely get another place with my younger brother for him to have a room to stay in, but my older brother would be on his own without being fully able to support himself.

I also feel like I would be resented for this choice by my family as I could be seen as not being there in a time of need for my brother/family.

I was riding as a passenger in my brother's car.  We were driving through normal traffic when he said ""woah, look at that dog!"" or something to that effect when he rear ended the car in front of us.  It was 100% his fault.  When the accident happened, I felt my head snap forward but it did not hurt immediately.  After the crash happened, everyone got out of their cars, exchanged information, and everyone acted cool.  The guy my brother hit called the police, and the police did come, and they gave my brother a ticket saying that he caused the crash.

My brother told me at the crash that he knew it was his fault.  I mean, how could it not be?

Well, about 2 days after the crash, my neck, shoulder, and upper back started to REALLY hurt.  Like really bad.  So I went to the ER.  They took some x-rays, told me nothing was broken, but said I could have a spine injury but I would need to see a specialist for that.  They also gave me some medication that isn't doing anything to help.

Husband came home and was surprised I was still there. Apparently Jane was going to meet with me and “the girls” but took drugs and passed out. Messing up the plan to tell everyone equally. 


I confronted John saying I was friends with him before Jane!  Before ANYONE in the group! Not only that he got my husband to LIE to me?! Unacceptable. He said they agreed Jane “could have me” in the divorce so he didn’t know what else to do. She doesn’t have much family and now fewer to no friends. 


John knows I’ve lost family members to drug addiction and the lies and hurt that came out of that. Jane has been using drugs, cheating, and hiding it for like 10 years. She admitted to this. John desperately wanted a big family. THATS gone. They both knew this is not something I would forgive. Even if I did, it’s MY CHOICE who I decide to have, or not have, as friends. I’m not property to split. 


I let it go because I knew John was devastated. They had been TTC and the whole time it was a lie.


My husband and I had a talk. I don’t approve but he thought I’d be getting my own call. That I’d be confused and worried for minutes not hours.


Moving forward John says I need to be there for Jane. He invites my husband out but not me. We’re also devastated that our whole social group is imploding. My husband went to a few outings to be supportive and to give John time. It’s been 6 months and still no invites for me. 


John has said he has nothing against me in this. Jane came clean and no one in my group is suspected of covering up for her, etc. She simply “asked for me” and it’s “the least he could do”. 



The group is divided. Some say I should be there for Jane. I’ve known her most of my life and they say she shouldn’t start from scratch without any friends after a divorce, rehab, etc. On the secret hysterectomy alone I just can’t respect her anymore. I don’t want her as a friend….. but I’m the only one “she asked for”. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-11,"AITA because I won’t let friends decide “who gets me” in their divorce? I (F) had a very good friend (M) John in high school. He started dating Jane. (all same age). In college I met and married my husband. We all went to the same college and all got along famously. It was really the most ideal thing ever. 


One night, now 15 years into our friendship, and 11 years into my marriage, I hear the phone and my husband is basically flying out the door in the dead of night. I said WTF is going on? He says he can’t tell me. He’s SUPER uncomfortable with this. I see his phone says John. He apologized profusely,
says he doesn’t know what to do, he can only say he promised not to say, and left.

102,1g1ilyu,WIBTA if I didn't invite my bestie's partner to my birthday hang?,"I (33 NB) am planning a small birthday thing with my wife (30 F) and my bestie (32 NB) to a planetarium event in a few months, followed up by dinner at my favorite place in that town, a small, mom and pop Indian restaurant. I'm feeling guilty because I don't want to invite Bestie's partner (24 F) Bree. They've been together a few years now, and I like the girl well enough to consider her a friend, but I don't want her there.

Don't get me wrong, I love when we do board game nights, movie nights, and dinners together, but more often then not, all of those things kind of bend to what Bree wants, and when it doesn't, she excuses herself to go hang alone on her bedroom or go home early. What I want to do and where I want to eat are completely opposite of what Bree likes, and honestly I don't want to deal with that. I want to eat Indian food, but Bree only really eats chicken tenders at restaurants and hates spice. The event is 2.5 hrs long and focused on space and science, which she has zero interest in and will leave the room when Bestie and I start talking about the latest images and reports that NASA releases.

If the planetarium was local, I wouldn't mind inviting her since Bree could eat beforehand and just go home when she was done hanging out, and my wife and I would bring Bestie back home ourselves, but it's a 2-3 hour drive each way.

If I invite her, I think she'll be bored the whole time and upset at the food choice, which will ruin the mood. If I don't explicitly NOT invite her, she will expect she's invited because Bestie is. If I do explicitly only invite Bestie, she will be upset that we're excluding her, even if I explain why. Bree is also the type that would rather go along with Bestie and be upset than stay at home alone, so I have zero expectation that if I invited her she would decline.

So WIBTA if I explicitly didn't invite Bree, and only invited my Bestie and wife?

Also any tips on kind ways to tell Bree this? I don't want to hurt her, but I don't want her there either.

104,1g1idtw,AITA for flaking on pre-established Halloween plans?,"So I m(22), have been best friends with m(23) CJ for about a year. CJ and I usually hang out one-on-one, but recently he's been bringing people I don't know around. There are now 3 of his friends that get invited every time we hang out. I don't dislike them, but it's a bit annoying to have 3 randoms hanging around, especially when none of them will speak to me. I tried to make conversation with them, but they make no effort to engage with me unless CJ prompts them directly. 

I didn't really have an issue with being ignored by his other friends, until I noticed that whenever he was with me, he'd constantly be on his phone texting them. I even stopped getting included in his hangouts. He would thoroughly tell me about his plans with his other friends, but make no move to bring me along. I tried to look past it, but here's the real kicker:

So CJ and I were at a restaurant. One of my old buddies, Dominick, works there and gives me the employee discount. When CJ noticed how cheap our bill was, he suggested we come back. 

We did, and he brought his sister, which was fine. She started talking about how ""fun the movie night"" was gonna be. I asked about it, and CJ immediately said ""You're not invited."" 

I was kind of floored, because I hadn't even asked to go. I was just trying to make small talk, but sure enough, it was those two, along with CJ's other friends who were going. I was the only one left out.

 I had a feeling CJ was just trying to use me for my employee discount, so I left. We had plans to trick or treat together, but when I found out his other friends would be coming, I booked a train ticket home for Oct. 30th. I've decided to hang out with my family instead, but I haven't yet told him I'll be flaking because I really don't feel like his best friend anymore.

105,1g1ibuy,AITA for removing 3 year olds fresh ear piercing,"So my ex partner (daughters mum) had asked me multiple times if she could get my 3 year old daughters ear pierced, to which I’d said “No, she cannot have her ears pierced” every time.

However, she has now gone behind my back to have this done even though I’d made it clear to her that I didn’t want it done under any circumstances.

So my question is AITA for removing them and threatening to have a PSO (prohibitive steps order) if she attempts to have them done again? I feel bad for removing them but at the same time I don’t feel any guilt whatsoever as I’d already made it clear not to do it and it’s been done despite this.
