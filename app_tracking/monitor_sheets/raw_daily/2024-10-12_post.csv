0,1g2brxj,AITA for being jealous over my friends boyfriend?,"I (20 trans M) have had a crush on my best friend Ray(19 F). We have known eachother since 7th grade and have been inseparable since then. We had a very small time where we dated, it was about 2 months, I ended it since I didn't think I was ready to date but I definitely loved her and I still do. We live together, separate rooms, in a simple apartment. 

About 2 months ago Ray got into a relationship with a guy, Finn(20M). He is a nice guy and I honestly don't have a problem with her dating him. He comes to our apartment often and since I'm gone a lot for college classes I never minded him being there that often. But recently, I've been doing online classes and I'm home a lot more so I see them together a lot. They cuddle on the couch all the time and I can hear them having dinner dates in our kitchen most nights. I have no issues with this since I have no room to say who Ray can and can't date but i have definitely been very jealous.

 I've told a friend of mine about this and they said it is very selfish of me to be jealous. I know it would be very rude if I outright made comments about Finn or about them spending time at our apartment but I haven't done that. I keep to myself when he's around cause I don't know him well. But my friend has practically shunned me for this ""being to selfish"". The same friend has told some of our other friends about this and they all seem to agree and have started calling me an asshole about my jealousy

She had to take her dog to the hospital and ended up spending about $1,500 on treatment. I feel awful about it, but I’m currently unemployed and don’t have any money. Because of this, I didn’t offer to help pay the vet bills, thinking she could handle it since she has savings.

Today, she brought it up when I mentioned wanting to finance a PS5 (just $42/month since I can't pay outright). She said it wasn’t fair that I was thinking about buying something for myself when I hadn’t offered to help with the bills. I told her I didn’t offer because I literally don’t have the money and that if she had asked me directly, I would’ve tried to pay over time. Now M's upset and feels like I’m dismissing her, but I was so scared for her dog I literally threw up so I don't understand how I'm being dismissive.

AITA for not offering to pay when I’m broke? And is it wrong of me to want to buy things for myself when I still feel guilty about what happened?

**UPDATE 10/12 10:20pm CT:** This was actually written from the dog owner's perspective, ""M"". I covered the full medical expenses and didn't ask my friend to pay because she told me earlier that day she was struggling to pay for food, and she's a close friend so I didn't want to add to her burdens even though I'm struggling as well. I paid for our food and wine that night. Then, when she told me she was thinking of buying a PS5 and I questioned why she would make a luxury expense when she didn't offer to help pay Maya's medical bill, she attempted to villainize and emotionally manipulate me.  I sent her this post and said ""thought it might help to see how others are seeing this situation"" and she (or her sibling) is now commenting on this post going off, so I've posted our full conversation here since I was actually giving her the benefit of the doubt in the initial post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g281l9/comment/lro0hys/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1g281l9/comment/lro0hys/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (& a screenshot of our conversation with dates): [https://imgur.com/a/KjJmTaX](https://imgur.com/a/KjJmTaX)

**Some key points:**

* This happened just about 2 weeks ago. I didn't ask her to help pay because she told me she was struggling to pay for her food, and I didn't want to add to her burdens since I do have emergency funds set aside, and our friendship was valuable to me. I make 42k and I make constant sacrifices to build my savings, even though most months I'm at a deficit. She is very aware that I struggle with funds.
* She commented that she DID offer to pay over time, but as noted in the comment exchange, she did not. She was with me when the hospital told me what the expenses were, and she remained silent, even though I kept bringing up how I don't know how I'm going to afford it.
* She says that I ""often have money and a lot of nice things"" which makes me feel like noting she is 30, lives with her parents and doesn't pay rent, and had a job that paid nearly double what I make for years before getting laid off and she is choosing to remain unemployed after the layoff. If I have savings and she doesn't, there's a good reason for that.
   * Additional note: She spends thousands of dollars on kpop albums, concert tickets, travel  expenses for kpop shows, and has admitted to have a spending addiction. I had no issue with these things as they didn't affect me, until she played the victim today for not having savings.
* My comment responses from her perspective used words she explicitly said to me - I didn't fictionalize any of it.
* When Maya was hospitalized, I couldn't stop crying and couldn't sleep. I kept checking my phone throughout the night thinking I was going to get a call that she had died. For days afterwards, I couldn't take my eyes off her in case she had side effects or permanent brain damage. I'm still too scared to leave her alone for more than an hour or two because I'm terrified something will happen to her.",Asshole,2024-10-12,"AITA for not offering to help pay my friend’s $1,500 vet bill after her dog ate my medication?

2,1g27znk,AITA for replacing my friend without telling her?,"So there is this bi-annual coding competition at my school that allows up to 3 people per team. For the past two years, I have teamed with two of my friends (we'll call them Ava and Bella). In these two years, I and Ava have always spend a huge amount of time outside of school preparing, while Bella has always been busy with things such as volleyball competitions and schoolwork (for classes that Ava and I are also in, but we still manage to make time for this competition), and has not had much time to meet up with us to get ready. Whenever we are doing anything and apportion some of the work and preparation to her, she always tells us that she will, but then doesn't because she says she has too much homework and too many tests, and will do our competition work later.

However, despite Bella's lack of time spent into this competition, she has not been completely indifferent. She still shows up to the final competitions and works hard during those competitions, and does some of the practice I mentioned earlier eventually (in a rushed way however, after we've asked her multiple times). Overall, she is a nice person and seems like she genuinely wants to be on this team, she just doesn't take this seriously enough like Ava and I. I would say because of this, our team has never placed very well in the final rankings since we have been more of a two person team rather than a three person team.

This year, Bella talked occasionally about how her workload this year has been even more overwhelming than last year, and that she wasn't even fully sure if she could commit to the competitions this year anymore. However, whenever she said that, she quickly changed her mind to still being able to compete later. Even though she said that, we knew that the problems from last year and the year before that would only get worse.

Then, Catherine, who is another friend, lost her team because they dropped out due to scheduling conflicts, so Ava and I decided to kick Bella out and invite Catherine into our team instead. We didn't want to break off our friendship with Bella, since we like her as a friend, just not as a teammate, so we tried to kindly push Bella to drop out without directing asking her if she could drop out by emphasizing the time commitments needed and that she couldn't meet that commitment. She seemed very unhappy though, and kept saying that she could still do the competition and would spend time outside of school, but we had trouble believing that since we have asked her countless times the previous years to spend more time and she never did despite agreeing to. 

Because of this, and the fact that the deadline was extremely close, I ended up just registering our team with Catherine rather than Bella before Bella fully agreed to dropping out. When Bella found this out, she was extremely upset about how we replaced her without even getting her approval, and now glares at me whenever she walks past me, not responding to any of my text messages either.

One of our friends Anthony, randomly decided he wanted to play with us, which is fine, the more the better right? So of course we have to teach him the basics and how to quest and all that but from the get go he won't listen. For example, one quest is to pick up 3 medical injectors and turn them in. For several weeks now we've been telling him ""Hey Anthony we found an injector come and take it"" and he says ok and grabs it or ignores us. And I understand at first you don't know what you're doing but after weeks of being on the same quest, and not listening, I think its ok for me and others to be a little upset?

So I made a hidden vc in our discord server and we sit in there and pretend we aren't on the game when he asks to play.

I now know she was wrong and we never got into a major fight so I will humbly and in the least petty way just leave the candle upside down next the sink so when she wakes up first to brush her teeth she can know that this candle was in fact meant to be lit, and that I was right.

The candle looked like most scented candles I’ve seen. Round glass, tan colored wax inside, smelled good, HAD F*ING WICKS. We get back, smoke alarm is going off, house is cloudy but no worse than burning food in the oven. Smokes worse in the bathroom so I blowout the candle and she tells me you’re not supposed to light that candle. WTF, why would it have wicks? Why would she put it on top of the toilet?

On this event there were two days on religious ceremony [not anything particularly important, but middling importance for us], I went with them yesterday, and today I chose to rest up for a late night party at a friend's house.

The party was meant to start at 9:30, but got delayed to 12:30, the thing is, they were fine with me going early and staying over, but seem to be more upset by the later start and me leaving house at midnight.

Out of sheer tiredness I chose to ditch my relatives today before the party to catch some hours of sleep. The friends I'm meeting are working now, I don't get to meet them so readily - this was one opportunity in the last 3 months and my last [potentially] till the coming December break.

6,1g26s0z,AITA for distancing myself when my father kept pressuring me into studying more?,"For context, I (14 soon 15 female) have just started high school this year, and it has been very stressful. I've been having trouble with studying ever since 5th grade, I struggled with pretty much all subjects except English and my grades have significantly dropped. I have told my parents but they said that I'm just not trying hard enough. I have thought of dropping out since the end of 8th grade and all of 9th grade, but sucked it up and kept quiet because i was afraid my father would get mad and make a fuss about it.

But a while ago, when bringing me back from high school, I was complaining that the school was too far, i didn't like the students and teachers, and still had trouble with school. He suggested i drop out, which i didn't expect. At first i pretended like i didn't want to because then i'd have nothing to do, but he said that building a career doesn't necessarily rely on getting a degree, so, when i was sure he wasn't joking, i agreed.

For context, I (14 soon 15 female) have just started high school this year, and it has been very stressful. I've been having trouble with studying ever since 5th grade, I struggled with pretty much all subjects except English and my grades have significantly dropped. I have told my parents but they said that I'm just not trying hard enough. I have thought of dropping out since the end of 8th grade and all of 9th grade, but sucked it up and kept quiet because i was afraid my father would get mad and make a fuss about it.

But a while ago, when bringing me back from high school, I was complaining that the school was too far, i didn't like the students and teachers, and still had trouble with school. He suggested i drop out, which i didn't expect. At first i pretended like i didn't want to because then i'd have nothing to do, but he said that building a career doesn't necessarily rely on getting a degree, so, when i was sure he wasn't joking, i agreed.

7,1g26rqm,AITA for telling my mom I want to quit uni? ,"
hi everyone! I (18F) just got into university into an English Language major. at first i thought I would like it, since i love reading, writing, and everything regarding languages but that’s not the case now. on the first week, it hit me: I don’t want to do this. it’s not something I want to do in my life, and now I’d much rather prefer be majoring in nursing or biology (yes, very different things from English.) The thing is, I can’t change my major this year. University rules. I need to wait until next year to change it but everything about university is completely draining - I hate every second of it. everything I do in classes is waiting for them to end, during the day I wait for the night and during the night I hope I don’t sleep because if I do, time will past faster and a new class awaits me in the morning. It’s just a horrible feeling and ever since the 1st week it’s gotten worse. I can’t tell you exactly how I feel - sadness? anger? I can’t tell. I’m like a robot with no emotions atp. And I just want to quit.

My mom doesn’t let me quit. After a month she still believes I will magically start loving my major (even after i told her that even if happened, i will still change next year.) i told her because she is paying for my tuition and since i came to the conclusion i came, i don't want something useless weighing in her pocket. but she doesn't let me quit. i texted her about this, had long conversations and tried to understand her side. but all i receive back are ""i know this is all my fault"" and comments about how my “bad mood” affects her. “you know what you’re doing, don’t you? you’re not ten anymore.” (meaning I was hurting her.) 

I don’t want to hurt her, that’s the last thing I would ever want to do. But I need to be selfish at least one time in my life and I know I’m dying everyday I spend on campus. 

the truth is, what’s holding my mom back is that she wants to have the “college student mom experience.” that’s all she talks about - how she’s mad I didn’t make any friends and how I don’t enjoy college parties or go to traditional meetings where she can join and take pictures. That’s because I hate everything about it. I’m sorry mom. I wish you could wait a year.

8,1g26pk8,AITA hurricane tree debacle ,"

 My boyfriend 35M (me30f) has been doing hurricane cleanup since Milton. One of the trees in his backyard got uprooted so it had to come down. So here’s what happened.. me being the awesome partner that I am volunteered to help with the yardwork when I’m not at work. So he woke me up from a nap this morning at 9 AM after I woke up at 7 AM to help him go look for gas which then he decided halfway through the drive that he didn’t even need because he thought I should watch this tree fall. Obviously, I grabbed my phone because like when does this ever happen?? so when I grabbed my phone, I started recording him signing the tree down and I jokingly go “ good job, babe just like I taught you” meanwhile I’ve never used a saw in my life. He then gets super dramatic and he was like what the hell get out of there. Come stand by me right now. He was acting like I was out of my mind or something because I was standing infront of this 100ft tree as he was sawing it down. I thought the video of him yelling at me was actually pretty comical so I posted it to my Instagram, like my public story not even my private friends. He thinks that he looks bad in the video for yelling at me, but I just think it’s funny. So tell me, am I the asshole? I’m not sure if he’s upset, nor do I really care.

My dad confronted my sister about asking me several months ago and told her it wasn't right. He told her she HAD to include all of us or none of us would attend the wedding and he would stop me going too. She told him she was not going to give into him. He said she shouldn't prioritize me over siblings that are younger or just not biologically related to us. She said they (him, his wife and the other kids) were only invited so she could have me there and since he was imposing such an awful rule she was just going to move the date, I'd be 18 and able to choose so she didn't need to invite the rest of them.

The new date is next year and I will be 18 and I'll already be moved out. My dad and stepmother are pissed she actually went ahead with her plan and that I still plan to be her man of honor. They told me I cannot and should not do this. That I am putting my other siblings feelings at risk and making them feel rejected by two of us. They said my sister was making me choose between her and the rest of my family and I should not choose her for that reason. I told them I would always choose her and they were not going to make me say no.

This argument continued and I ignored it for about two months but the other night they told me to sit and talk to them and they said my other siblings had noticed what was going on and I should feel bad about that. I told them I didn't. They told me I have five other siblings and shouldn't hurt a relationship with them a relationship with one. I told them I didn't care what they say, I'll be her man of honor and they won't stop me. So they need to just let it go because they are making the countdown to my 18th birthday a bigger deal.

They said I'm being hurtful and I'll regret my decision to burn all these bridges in 10 or 20 years.

My partner and I have been together for 10 years, and we’ve started having more family dinners since our kids are getting older (ages 6 and 2). I feel like dinner is one of the few times we can actually sit down as a family, connect, and talk about our day. However, my partner often pulls out their phone during dinner to check social media or reply to texts.

I’ve asked them repeatedly to put the phone away and just be present for 30 minutes, but they get defensive and say that they’re just “checking something quickly.” The problem is, it’s not just “quick.” It happens almost every night, and it really disrupts the family dynamic.

Recently, I decided to make a no-phone rule at the dinner table, and they got upset, saying I’m treating them like a child and that it’s “controlling.” I argued that I just want us to have some real family time without distractions, and that it’s setting a bad example for our kids. They still think I’m overreacting and that I need to “relax” because it’s not that big of a deal.

They do celebrate their wedding anniversary but that's a them thing.

His parents were extremely pushy and didn’t follow any of the rules we were trying to make for our daughters. For example, when my oldest was a baby, i got called into work. I told my MIL we needed her look after Elsa. She’d been sick, so I didn’t want to leave her with a sitter. MIL agreed but said she had already had plans and would have to take the baby. Since this involved taking Elsa out into the cold and into a stranger’s house, I wasn’t comfortable with that. She did agree eventually.

We set a clear boundary around social media. No posting pictures or sharing ours, or commenting or liking them, because they would show up in other people’s feeds. Several times I had to remind her not to comment, but she did anyway, so I unfriended her. 

It was lots of stuff like that. We would ask for help or make a rule, then have to justify it. We felt like our children and family weren’t a priority, so right before Anna was born 6 years ago, we cut contact with the whole family.

This spring, my husband decided it’s not fair for our daughters. So, I agreed we could try it again with the understanding that if things hadn’t changed, we’d go back to the way we’d been doing it. Things were rocky at first but now his family are excited we came back. Everyone is willing to let the past be the past, except his older sister (37).

The only time she’s seen us was for Anna’s birthday party. She was polite, and brought her a nice card and present, but left as soon as the party was over. She didn’t post on her socials about Anna’s birthday or anything. 

Finally, last week we called her about it. She was quiet for a while and then said that she felt like she couldn’t trust us anymore, and that she had had be the one to hold things together when we left the first time, and she didn’t want to open that door again, and she hung up. 

My husband is really mad. He says they were close as kids and she’s always been dramatic and a diva but this is unusual. She doesn’t seem like she’s angry, she just acts like we don’t exist. With the holidays coming up, she told MIL she’ll do birthdays and Christmas with us for the kids, but that’s it.

The only time she’s seen us was for Anna’s birthday party. She was polite, and brought her a nice card and present, but left as soon as the party was over. She didn’t post on her socials about Anna’s birthday or anything. 

Finally, last week we called her about it. She was quiet for a while and then said that she felt like she couldn’t trust us anymore, and that she had had be the one to hold things together when we left the first time, and she didn’t want to open that door again, and she hung up. 

My husband is really mad. He says they were close as kids and she’s always been dramatic and a diva but this is unusual. She doesn’t seem like she’s angry, she just acts like we don’t exist. With the holidays coming up, she told MIL she’ll do birthdays and Christmas with us for the kids, but that’s it. We were just trying to protect ourselves, but now she’s acting like we did it to target her. Are we really TAHs here, or is she just being dramatic like my husband says?",1.0,1.0022784,1,1

Yesterday, i went to meet up with a friend of mine (female). I told my parents that id be home before sunset; 6 30pm ish and that id be leaving campus at around 4pm. Long story short, i ended up leaving at 5 since there were issues with the bus and reached over to my friends by 5 30. We were meeting up at those cute ceramic painting places.

My dad, ends up staying awake the whole time i was there. Keep in mind theres like an 8 hour difference between where i am and where my parents are, so for him its around 2 am when its 6 pm for me. My dad texts me a couple times, asking how i am and all, and i tell him that im gonna end up getting back to campus late since i didnt realise how long paintings gonna take, and my dad leaves me on seen. I text him a couple times, asking if he went to sleep, but no reply he just saw my texts

I left the place at around 8, and my mom starts texting me, telling me that i shouldn’t be out ‘so late’ and i shouldve looked at the time. I text her back that i’m okay and that im almost at campus. It’s like 4 am for her btw.

I send my parents pictures and everything, like i usually do whenever I’m out, and they don’t reply at all. I head to bed and wake up the next morning to my sisters telling me that my dad is super pissed and hasn’t eaten anything.

My mom then calls me, yelling at me about how i shouldn’t go out or be out so late. I tell het that you guys are treating me like a child, acting as if you don’t trust me at all. She keeps going on about how i should’ve been more responsible.

I understand that they’re worried for me, and i’m grateful for that. But do you think this is a bit too much? I wasn’t even alone that night, my friend was with me the entire time. Am i the asshole?

They went in the litter box, I cleaned the litter box every now and then when she was sick or pregnant but now…

Those cats passed away. She got new cat we didn’t know was pregnant and now we have 3 cats. We also have 2 kids. As the person that works the most in the house I’m also constantly the one who gets them to daycare and brings them back home. I then watch them til they go to sleep. Feed them, etc. play with them, everything that comes with parenthood.

She works an opposite shift so she essentially gets from when she wakes up til 4 p.m. in the house alone.

I get home, the house is a wreck. She leaves food out? Leaves her dirty dishes in the sink, which that’s fine. Whatever, it means I have to clean before I can even cook for our children. Sucks but I do it.

Well these cats have 3 litter boxes. Every single ____ing day I come home to piss on not only our bed, but our children’s as well. 

Every single day I come home I’m washing bedding, changing it out, making dinner, using a carpet cleaner on their mattresses, consuming all of my time.

I’ve talked to her about it, she says she’ll try new litter, I really don’t think she has. I’ve had several talks about how look “I understand you love these cats but I can’t in all honesty keep coming home to piss everywhere but the litter box. They’re peeing on our children’s beds, their clothing, etc. this isn’t okay, we’ve got to get rid of them. 

She has a strong emotional attachment to them though but today I finally gave her an ultimatum. Either the cats go, the issue gets solved or me and the kids are staying somewhere else. 

It’s sucking all the energy out of me. I work construction 10 hours a day 5 days a week, by the time I’m done getting their beds ready it’s like 2 hours past their bed time.

It’s so bad I’ve gotten an extra mattress to swap out atleast one of their beds so I don’t have to wait on both to dry. I make sure their door is closed so they can’t get in. When I ask her why the door to our kids room was opened she says “well the cats love to stair out their window”

17,1g24o1l,WIBTA if I stopped splitting the utilities with my roommates? ,"I have two roommates. We split all rent, utilities, household costs by 3 every month. Recently, our landlords told us they are selling the place and leaving the country and that we’d have to move out by January. We discussed as roommates and decided not to fight them on the lease. They had to sell because they’re being forced to leave the country permanently on short notice and they’ve been otherwise really good landlords (fixed everything free, very reasonable, no rent increases). This led to me calling my boss and expediting a promotion scheduled for April (when the lease ends) which would require me to move cities. I am now moving in January instead of April. 

After I had already pulled those strings the landlord said we can now stay until the lease terminates in April. Too late for me, I’ve already gotten things in motion so I am moving out in January no matter what. 

My two roommates have since decided they will stay as long as they can and will not move out until the lease ends in April. Doesn’t make much sense to me because I’ll be taking more than half the furniture and kitchen ware so they’ll be left with an empty unfurnished house and it’d be easier to find a new place in the middle of winter than in the spring rental season, but that’s their choice I guess. I have committed to paying my portion of the rent until the lease ends and I intend to. But WIBTA if I stopped paying my split of the utilities and other expenses? It adds up to about $100-200 per month. The reason I ask is because a large portion of these expenses are fixed costs that would exist whether we used 1000000 GJ or 0.00001 J. They also expect me to. 

Thanks! 

Edit: fixed run on sentence lol 

Edit 2: Also just confirmed the lease and sublease (one roommate is subleasing)

The master lease basically says the tenant is responsible to pay the utilities respecting their use of the property (I will not be using the property) and the sublease says the subtenant is responsible for 33% of the cost of utilities.

So what this means, as I interpret it, is that 1) I’m not using the property so I’m off the hook and 2) one roommate legally only has to pay his 33% written in his sublease and the other one would get stuck with 66% lol

Not that any of this matters because these guys are known by me to avoid conflict and wouldn’t sue over a couple hundred anyways.

Context: I will try to keep this brief. My partner‘s brother is new here to Canada, and quite reclusive. He’s very shy, he’s got no friends here, nor any family aside from his sister and myself. He suffers from some mental illness, and is known to really blow up if he gets upset (he has been in a psychiatric hold in a hospital before). He has a cat, and I think it’s an amazing relationship that they have even though his cat is definitely an asshole lol. He likes to travel quite a bit, and when that happens, the expectation is that my partner and I watch his cat. I would never object to doing something like this, in general, but his expectations are that we either bring the cat to our condo for the duration of his trip, or go and stay over at his place for the duration of his trip to be with the cat 24/7. He says it’s because he’s worked from home his entire life, the cat is very used to someone there and needs to be around someone all of the time. Generally speaking, I don’t have any opinion on how people raise their pets because it has nothing to do with me, so I won’t argue that logic. 

However, I am pushing back at this time because I believe it is ridiculous and unreasonable to expect my partner and I to have to either bring the cat to a condo or to go and stay over at his place for the rest of the trip. In the past, I’ve knuckled under and accommodated to his request because my partner was begging me, due to her fear that he would completely blow up and do something terrible to himself, etc. There was even a point where their parents visited, and the four of them took a trip and I had to go stay alone at his house for four nights to watch his cat.

He is planning a trip to Japan in December, and I am pushing back on the request that we stay at his house or bring the cat here (it sheds heavily, and it bothers my nose and throat). I have always maintained that I have no problem looking after the Cat by going by and spending some time with it and making sure that it has food, water and clean litter. My partner is saying she’s afraid of the reaction so it’s just easier to do what he wants, but I think that’s ridiculous and just because he has a mental illness it does not give you a get out of jail free card. She’s saying that she will go stay at the house by herself for 10 days, but then I feel like the asshole for a separate reason which is not being there with her because I’m quite adamant about my position. Oh, and I know for a fact that if we do get into a discussion and he doesn’t like our response and throws a complete bitch fit and does something crazy and stupid, his sister will get extremely upset and then blame me for not knuckling under.

when I told her that I was upset not bc she stayed the night at home but bc she lied about it and kept sticking to her story , she got emotional , began to cry and say that I was a cold human being who doesn't understand what being a mother is. i feel deeply hurt and my heart is broken bc I rlly love my mother but she has broken mine and my sister's trust multiples time in past .
if we tell her that she's broken our trust b4 she gets angry and demands for incidents and starts tearing up again.

when I told her that I was upset not bc she stayed the night at home but bc she lied about it and kept sticking to her story , she got emotional , began to cry and say that I was a cold human being who doesn't understand what being a mother is. i feel deeply hurt and my heart is broken bc I rlly love my mother but she has broken mine and my sister's trust multiples time in past .
if we tell her that she's broken our trust b4 she gets angry and demands for incidents and starts tearing up again.

so aita for being upset with her for breaking my trust?

22,1g23c3s,AITA for still snapping with my friend even though my GF feels betrayed by her?,"AITA for still snapping with my friend even though my GF feels betrayed by her?

So, my girlfriend (GF) of 7 months has been having some conflicts with my friend group. I won’t go into too much detail, but basically, she feels like she’s been bullied by them. While my friends aren’t entirely innocent, I’ve talked to them, and I don’t think the situation is as bad as my GF is interpreting it. I’ll admit, I’ve probably made things worse by sharing negative thoughts back and forth between my GF and my friends. She didn’t exactly help either—she’s deleted them from Snapchat and has been posting public Snapchat stories about how she’s the victim. The catch is, she’s only making these stories public when they’re about my friends. I told her they’ve seen it, but she shrugged it off, saying “so what? It’s just facts.”

Now, I’m currently on a work trip, and I sent her a Snap earlier today. She asked if I’m still snapping with one specific friend (let’s call her Jenny), who’s the one my GF feels most betrayed by. Am I the asshole for still snapping with Jenny? I don’t talk much to her, just send her the same generic snaps I send to everyone. I’ve also turned down most hangouts with my friend group since this conflict started two months ago.

My GF sent me a long message explaining that her reactions are “normal,” just maybe a bit more intense because of past trauma. I initially tried to explain that things weren’t as bad as she felt, but the more I tried, the angrier she got, so I gave up and decided to just keep my GF and friends separate. The problem is, anytime I mention my friends, she reacts with a lot of anger/rage. She also hates when if I want to talk to my brother about my problem with her. But when she is in rage, she call a lot of friends and tell them how bad I am as a bf that don't have her back. And she also share a lot in snap story about hinting at how a partner should always support each other etc.

One more thing: my friends recently withdrew an invitation for my gf to a pretty important party because they felt they was uncomfortable around her. My gf is pretty angry I still went.

So, AITA for still snapping generic snaps with Jenny? My gf says it sends a signal that what they do to her is Okey.

23,1g233qo,AITA for cutting my step daughter off financially ,"I 35 F married my now Husband 41 male 7 years ago. My husband had three kids from his previous marriage and I had two kids from a previous relationship. 

My husband and I welcomed a child together 8 months after getting married. I have always treated my step children like my own . My husband’s oldest daughter we will call her Kelly 19 F is a sophomore in college and recently got engaged to her high school sweetheart we call him Zach  19 m . 

Both go the same college and have been together for 4 years. We all love her fiancé and his family. Zach asked my husband for his blessing and everything. We all figured they would get married after they graduated. My step daughter told me they plan to get married next summer after they are done with their sophomore year. 


Her fiancé and her plan to get an apartment at college and stay with his grandma in her basement during the summer. Kelly works as a host at college and babysits during the summer. She refuses to get out college loans and after financial aid she has to make payments of around $800 a month. 

Her mother helps and we help what we can but ultimately we told her if she chose an out of state college she will be financially responsible. I told her I respect her decision but to be aware she will start her nursing classes her junior year and it is nearly impossible to work during those two years. 

I informed her this weekend when she told us her plans to wed next summer that I will not be paying her car insurance or cell bill after she gets married. Kelly got upset with me and refuses to talk to me even though I explained my reason. 

I told her that it was her decision to get married young and by doing so your saying I am independent and ready to start a future with my husband. She explained well yeah but I still need your help I said yes of course I will help here or there but not paying your bills every month until you can pay them yourselves. I just think they both should focus on school and get married after they graduate so they can both be financially independent instead of being married but still independent on my parents. So AITA for cutting her off. 

Edit: My husband did inform her of this joint decision. Kelly is 19 will be 20 next Spring while her siblings are 17 ( almost 18, 15, 13, 8 and 6. We are not financially well off and live paycheck to paycheck. I have been pulling in overtime to pay off debt that occurred when my husband was not working because of health reasons. 

The 17 year has been told if she moves out on her own she is on her own because she does have self entitlement. She needs tough love mom, dad, step mom and step dad will agree. I am happy she has job she works where I work but still obsessed  with boyfriend. She didn’t come home one night so different situation prolly a future Reddit post lol

The 15 year old will be dependent on us it be emotionally, financially and mentally he  has Autism.  He has made some amazing accomplishments in life he will tell you I have been more like his mom than his real mom. He has a heart of gold

The 13 year old and 8 year old are mine from a previous relationship. There father does not help or see them because he is in prison prolly also a future  Reddit post considering he paroles in December of this year
 
The 6 year old the one who is biologically my husband and I is the baby and just loves tornadoes. 


I will be there for my kids they be bonus or bio but at the same time I want them to be responsible for themselves. I grew up if you don’t buy it you don’t appreciate it. I have always paid my own bills starting at age 16. And yes at 16 I paid for my school fees, cloths, food , cell, insurance, graduation gown and cap, and dresses. Trust me I do not expect my kids to pay for these things. I just paid for Kelly’s sister graduation stuff. I will be here to help but grown up decisions means grown up responsibilities. 

Marriage is serious and marriage couple need to have the financial conversation. Talk over a monthly budget date nights, food, rent and ect.

24,1g22rwo,AITA for telling my best friend’s GF about his fentanyl addiction,"Let’s call my friend John and his girlfriend Jane. John and I got really close in college, and we became even tighter after living together post-graduation. Naturally, I became good friends with Jane too, as I’d often third-wheel their hangouts (or as she joked, she’d be the one third-wheeling me and John). I’m telling you this to paint a picture of how close we all are.

John’s always been into drugs since we met. It started out light, with him just being a big stoner in college, but over time, he began experimenting with heavier stuff like Xanax, cocaine, etc. You’d think it would drag him down, but John’s sharp and charismatic. He was always a functioning user. He graduated fine, landed a solid job, and seemed to have it together.

The real trouble started when he got into opioids: Oxy, Percs, anything he could get his hands on. It started gradually but has since developed into a full-blown addiction. I’ve expressed my concerns over the years, and he always tells me he’s going to quit. He’s made countless promises to get clean, but none of them have stuck. I’ve supported him through every failed attempt, but the cycle has repeated so much that I’ve become kind of numb to his pledges of sobriety.

Here’s the kicker: recently, John has started using fentanyl, and as you probably know, that’s a game-changer. Before, he was still functioning, but now he’s been laid off from his job and is showing signs of depression (he stays inside all day, gambles online, and isolates himself from friends). Without any income, he’s been borrowing money from me to fund his habit. He claims it’s for bills, but I know what it’s really for. I feel trapped — I know I’m enabling his addiction, but saying no to someone I see as a brother feels impossible when I see how desperate he is.

Now, about Jane. She’s a great person and has a lot going for her. John really lucked out. While I only hang out with her when John’s around, I’ve gotten to know her well enough to consider her an actual friend irrespective of our ties to John. She’s aware of John’s drug use, but she doesn’t know the full extent like I do, especially his fentanyl addiction. John hides it well from her.

This is where I need advice: since I don’t live with John anymore, I can’t keep tabs on him like I used to. He tells me he’s tapering off the fentanyl, but I have no way of knowing if that’s true. I’m starting to think the best way to help him would be to tell Jane so that she can monitor him and help hold him accountable. But here’s the issue: John has told me that his relationship with Jane has been rocky lately, and I’m worried that telling her could lead to them breaking up, causing John to spiral even further. 

TL;DR: My best friend is addicted to fentanyl, and his life is unraveling. I’m considering telling his girlfriend, but I’m worried it would feel like a betrayal and might cause a breakup that would make his addiction even worse.

27,1g22i3e,AITA for how I refused to speak to my half sister for my mom?,"I (17f) have four siblings. Eldest is my half sister (19) and younger siblings are my full brothers (14 and 12). Mom is my half sister's stepmom. Dad was married before. His first wife died because of a rupture during the delivery. They saved my half sister, but couldn't save her mom. Six months later my parents met and 8 months after that they were married.

My mom and half sister always had a pretty okay relationship. She never called her mom or another mom-like title. She always used mom's first name. When she says mom she means her mom who died. She has a really close relationship with her mom's side of the family. She'd go to see them a lot and was kept very much a part of their family. I remember her loving that time when we were younger and begging for more. My parents believe that her mom's family might have been a big reason why she never called mom 'mom' and why she wasn't super close to me or my brothers. My half sister always made the half and step distinction and that confused a lot of people. Some extended family members would make a point to tell her mom was raising her. But she always said mom was her stepmom not her mom.

Things got more clear 2/3 years ago. My half sister made it so clear she doesn't consider mom one of her actual parents. She was interviewed for the school newsletter because she was captain of one of our school teams and when asked about her parents she talked a lot about dad, mentioned her mom a few times but never mentioned my mom. She gave dad the credit for raising her. Not my mom at all. She also did a personal essay on what it's like growing up without a mom. Then when she graduated she only listed dad under her parents. She didn't list mom at all and when asked she said she didn't list mom because she would never mention her and not her mom. But they had a rule about not listing parents who died several years ago... or something.

My half sister is in college now and she doesn't live with us anymore. Since she moved out she spends more time with her maternal family and while she hasn't gone no contact, really makes more of an effort with dad than the rest of us, even mom. This upset mom. She feels like she was discarded and like the maternal family have helped push her out. A few days ago she suggested I could bring up the distance to my half sister. I told her I don't want to get involved. Mom asked if it didn't bother me. I told her I think she deserves more recognition but I'm not close to my half sister so getting involved just seems like it's drama and it's not like she cares what I think. I also told her I don't know what it's like from my half's sister's POV so it feels wrong. So I won't interfere.

My dad told me I could have handled that talk with mom better and should have shown more sensitivity.

I told her I think she deserves more recognition but I'm not close to my half sister so getting involved just seems like it's drama and it's not like she cares what I think. I also told her I don't know what it's like from my half's sister's POV so it feels wrong. So I won't interfere.

My dad told me I could have handled that talk with mom better and should have shown more sensitivity.

28,1g22axh,AITA for not watching our kids for her birthday?,"To keep it short and sweet, my wife has moved on after years of us having a bad marriage. I decided to try and reconcile this summer not knowing or realizing she was already involved with someone else. We still live together. We do day to day life together. We depend on one another. Despite all of that she’s adamant that she’s no longer married and she wants a divorce. I’ve been coping with it as best I can but it’s been a really painful experience. 

To make matters worse she’s not very good at concealing her plans so I found out that she’s planning to spend her bday weekend with this man. She’s been down playing it and asking why I can’t watch the kids for her and my response is I’m not in space to watch the children for your BAEday Weekend. It’s all too soon and too much for me honestly. 

As a result she’s upset and feels like I’m putting a damper on her weekend. I told her months ago to properly prepare and have sitters because I’d likely be out of town myself. I need to get as far away from her as possible and busy myself so I don’t think about it as much. 

So let me know. AITA? Childish? Petty? 
If the shoe was on the other foot she’s already said she wouldn’t do it. What about you all? 


🚨 UPDATE 🚨

Well, the consensus is in! lol you guys definitely let me have it. Reddit never disappoints! It’s why I always come on here. I think I’d lean more towards ESH though but that’s my opinion. I’m fine with being the AH in this situation. I’ve been called worse. At the end of the day I do not agree with how she’s conducting herself and I do not have to watch the kids so she can have a weekend away with bae. Idc what anyone says. 

Wanted to clarify a few things:

NEVER told my wife I’d watch the kids for her next weekend. I’ve definitely considered it but I’ve never definitively told her I would on her or in person. Please show me where and what post I made that agreement. I work on the weekends but even if I just wanted to play pocket pool all weekend long that’s my prerogative. I’d love to see how everyone who responded in so much angst and discuss would handle this situation if they were in my shoes. 

Secondly, I had/have NO trouble dating or getting a woman. I shut things down when I realized it couldn’t go but so far. Also, women have better morals and standards than men so some of them weren’t with dating a married man from the get go. The only reason her and this guy have even gotten this far is because she lied about still being married and living with me. So everything she’s established has been on a foundation of lies anyway. 

Happy Saturday Everyone!

29,1g228nf,AITA for not allowing my future MIL at our marriage proposal?,"Will (23, fake name) plans to propose to me (F26) at the end of the month. We both want a meaningful proposal with a few close friends.

Will is not close to his family at all and is indifferent to his parents being there. But his mom is **adamant** that she, his dad, and his older sister be there. She didn't even ask him; she just said that she must be there as soon as she saw the ring.

I don't want his mom to be there because she can be dramatic and overbearing. I feel like I have to be on my best behaviour when I'm around her and I can't act natural. I want to be relaxed at the proposal, not have to guard my behaviour because I'm worried about her reactions or what she might be thinking about me.

Will and I are both Hispanic, first-generation Americans, and traditional Catholics, so I understand how important it is to honour your parents and family. His mom is also Catholic and I think she genuinely cares about our souls and well-being. But the way she cares is too much for me.

She is constantly overstepping others' boundaries. She treats Will like a child. When she isn't included in his personal, health, and financial plans, she cries and says things like, how could you do this to me?

His dad and sister are pretty quiet with me and even with Will. I think they would be fine with not being there. But they always side with his mom's wishes when Will makes his own decisions in similar situations.

My Catholic parents are fine with not being there and said that this should be a special moment for us. That I should be able to look back on it with happiness.

I might be TA because marriage is supposed to be about bringing families together and it is not uncommon to have family at proposals. And we are inviting friends so it won't be just the two of us. It might be insulting to not allow his family there and could cause a rift between our families.

Will hasn't told her yet and I know she is going to be extremely upset.

30,1g21pkk,AITA for not accommodating the needs of my partner greatly enough and going straight home/skipping a bakery stop when my partner (who has a sudden need to go sometimes) needed the toilet?,"I (27f) and my partner (28m) are planning a new bathroom. I suggested we go to look at bathroom shops and he begrudgingly agreed. I knew he would lag so planned in a trip to a bakery as a treat to break up visits. 

At the shop before the bakery, he said he needed to pee. He has an undiagnosed but real issue of suddenly needing to pee quickly and at that point I also needed to go too! I suggested we still go to the bakery after anyway as there was likely a toilet there and it was just around the corner. The bakery was in a courtyard, each unit doesn't have its own toilet but there is usually one for the complex, we just needed to ask where. He refused to ask the server while we were in the queue (around a 5-minute wait), so I suggested he go to the petrol station over the road as I've used theirs before. I wait in the line for 5 mins, collect the goods and asked for the toilet and I used it. I message my partner to let him know there was one there too.

When leaving, I call him to say there is a loo and if he still needed, he could use it. He said he was in the petrol station waiting behind someone to go to the toilet. I say I'd drive over and pick him up and asked if he would like to go to a vintage market after, he said 'yeah if I can use this toilet'. I then walk to the car and drive over thinking all was fine. When arriving he calls to ask where I am, I was at the petrol station. He'd walked back to the bakery despite me saying I’d get him, and he said he didn't use the petrol station toilet because it was locked. I asked whether he asked the staff, he said no. I am then annoyed, he just needed to ask at both places to use the toilet, but he refused. I understand he would be stressed because he would need to go but it was frustrating that he wouldn't advocate for himself.

I raise my voice on the phone and say this is ridiculous. I was also just frustrated because I knew he'd want to go straight home, and he would be hurt that I got annoyed. When driving home, he said he'd never agreed to go to a market afterwards, that I always get annoyed when plans don't go my way, that I treat him poorly considering his condition, and never appreciate this is a need of his that I need to support and accommodate. He thought it was selfish of me to go to the bakery despite not being 100% sure there was a toilet there and that it was unreasonable for him to ask a server while still in the queue. I felt hurt, this was a nice trip out that had turned sour, I presented two options to solve the issue, and I had managed to go to the toilet so felt that this was avoidable. I also felt that to just go home was annoying as there was another bathroom shop planned on the list which was now written off. I was also conscious that he lay the blame at my feet and that he still needed to go to the bathroom he was growing in discomfort.

My sister (20) no longer wanted to live with our father and she left to my mother’s and then decided she did not want to be there either. I told her she could move in with me.

She moves in & does not help with anything financially at my place. A few weeks after moving in she gets a part time job and still won’t help w/ anything. (Not even the groceries that she ate.) I set boundaries and tell her she has to pay me 100 a month to stay. She never pays and l let it be. 

She’s always been irresponsible, I was planing on living abroad for a year (I work from home) l tell her I will be leaving her in the apartment and she has to pay 700 dollars a month. My rent is 1445 and all utilities are included in the rent and I left all furniture there. She agrees cause what 20yo doesn’t want an apartment for themselves in a city where renting a bedroom goes for 1600+ a month. 

All goes well for a few months, she is paying her part of the rent. However 6 months in I find out she moved her BF into my apartment (she said only for 2 weeks while he found an apartment but he was already at my place for a week & couldn’t find a place, he also had no money because supposedly his friend who he used to live with was renting him a room and took his money and gave up the apartment he had leaving him broke and homeless).

I find out cause a cousin needed a place to crash for a few weeks. (my cousin paid rent for the time he stayed) I find out about this on the phone with her while I am out of the country. I am upset so l tell her they need to pay the full sum of the apartment since he is living there and I am not going to pay for her and her man to live in my one bedroom apartment when I am not even living there and they both work and she says no. my mother agrees with her, saying my sister is doing me a favor by paying part of the rent while I am away (I can afford my apartment just fine on my own) Because I make more money and my sister can’t keep a job and only does low paying jobs and her boyfriend couldn’t keep a job either what I was doing asking her to pay the apartment was wrong. My mother calls me a bad person, demon child and bad mouths me and talked horrible things to anyone who would listen. She said “she can move anyone in because she is paying for her side of the apartment.” 

(Against my mother’s wishes I got her and her man to split the rent in 3 (my rent is 1445. My cousin stayed for 2 months and he paid the 3rd part. When my cousin left I told her she had to pay the full sum and she said no. My mother treated me like shit. I only had 9 months left of my lease so I agreed to pay the third part.

Me (30,F) and my roommate and long-time best friend (31, F) share a house. It largely works. We have our ups and downs. Lately it's mostly her misinterpreting my neutral and making them into downs, and me doing vice versa. We're working on it and just shared Chinese food and are otherwise quite good at squashing beef.

We've been combating it. She buys tools and traps, and I find the little places they hide and clean them. We are a vicious and effective team.

However, I found that the Litter Genie receptacle she uses for our downstairs litter box was FULL of both flies and gnats. They coated the top of the lid. I pulled it out, opened it up, gagged, and ran upstairs. I refused to go back down and emphasized that this was her fault and it needs to be addressed. She said she'd get to it after her workday. I said "" well, there's currently a huge amount of flies NOW"" and she hopped off of her work desk and addressed it. She was passive aggressive the whole evening after, but owned up that yeah she probably should've been more attentive. Mind you, I've never been on board with the whole ""keep the shit in a container for ages because it's easy! :D"" concept, and have told her, multiple times, that I don't like it.

I emphatically told her I have always thought the Litter Genie was a stupid product; she replied that it wasn't, but that it got bad because the bags are expensive and she didn't replace them like she should. I insisted she SHOULD throw them away, but reassured that I can't control what she does/won't do it myself and won't force a change.

We still have the Litter Genie. In theory it's going to be better; I've promised to work harder to take on some of the load of multiple daily scoops.

But man. Shit sitting in a bucket seems like a fly trap regardless, and I KEEP. TRYING. to tell her. It's like it's bouncing off a wall.

A day later we had a conversation about sharing responsibilities/helping with daily tasks, and she let slip at the end of an otherwise-productive and civil talk that she ""doesn't have her hopes up"" when I stated that I'd stop being as lazy as I'd been and pick up more of the slack. I asked why the f\*ck she'd say that and told her it made the entire conversation prior seem like a bad-faith waste of time.

Me (30,F) and my roommate and long-time best friend (31, F) share a house. It largely works. We have our ups and downs.

36,1g204bj,AITA for making my stepdaughter do more chores than my son?,"My husband and I (both 47) brought one child each into our marriage, his daughter (24) and my son (22). My husband and I have been married for 17 years and we all get along for the most part.

The biggest continuing issue we have is that I make my step daughter do more chores and that's almost always been the case. I work 30-40 hours a week and my husband works around 50 so I handle a lot more of the household and child care. She often complained to her father who complained to me but I felt like he agreed more with me because he only mentioned she complained and let it go.

The chores were fairly light and even through elementary school for both of them. When they got to middle school though my son started taking advanced placement classes, which have more homework. He also started doing some volunteer work, mentoring younger kids. He's always been very scholarship minded because he knew we didn't have a lot to save back. The chores were still pretty even, but on days when his tutoring/mentoring ran late, I did them. I didn't do the same for her when she was out later with friends. She has always been well liked with lots of friends because she has a very bright, fun personality. In HS, my son picked up more volunteer hours, college prep and AP classes, and got a job. He paid for his ""extras"" and she had to earn her allowance. That's when the bigger discrepancy happened. 

Now he's going into his graduate program, doing research, working two part-time jobs, and still tutoring on the side. We pay for his housing, food, etc so he can save some money. She's still very much a social butterfly and I love that she has so many people who love her. But she has no job, no college, and isn't trying to get either. We've offered to help her any way we can but she just says she's too busy. So she has far more chores than him. 

Apparently she complained more to her father and he has finally decided I need to balance it out more. I don't even know how when my son has so little time and told him no.

They both say I'm being unfair and the more I think about it, I don't know. Aita?

Edit: Her chores are to sweep, dust when necessary, and wash bedding and towels once a week. Her allowance is $1,000/month from her father. His chores are take out the trash, load the dishwasher, cook his own food. He also helps with outside chores when asked. He declined an allowance because he knows we are trying to save money ourselves and he has a job. I do the cooking, mopping, kitchen and bathroom cleaning myself.

38,1g1z1vh,AITA for not blindly supporting my partner ,"I (39F) was hanging out with my partner (37M) tonight. We’ve been dating for about 8 months, but it’s still a pretty new relationship.

He recently bought a caravan to live in with his pets after going through a tough situation. We were talking about it, and he mentioned he was upset because he had asked a friend for help, and they didn’t respond for about 24 hours.

I don’t know the friend or what was asked, so I asked if they had kids. He said yes, and I explained that as a parent, I sometimes get distracted and don’t respond to messages right away. He agreed, and then I asked what he had requested. He told me he’d asked if he could drop his dog off at their place while he was at work. I asked if he offered them money, and he said no. I suggested that since dogs require attention, he could offer to pay them. He didn’t agree with me and was just like his dog will be in the yard. Keep in mind d this will be multiple days a week, and I tried to explain that if I was asking someone to babysit that the minimum expectation is that I offer them money for their time/resources. 

At this point, he got up to get a drink and seemed a little annoyed. He said he’s known his friend for years and that I don’t know them (which is true). I asked if he was mad at me, and he said yes because I didn’t take his side.

For context, my ex used to say the same thing about me not supporting him in the same way. I try to see things from the other person’s perspective and don’t feel comfortable blindly taking sides. I just want to understand the situation and have a conversation about it. I feel like I struggle to read the room in these situations that they just want blind support and to not try to understand the other persons actions and perhaps try to grow from it.

39,1g1ykj0,AITA for not showing up to an old friends fiancés 30th bday celebration?,"My old friend invited me to her partners 30th birthday celebration and I said I would come because I assumed it was close to where she lived which I could afford to go. 

When I saw the address i immediately started looking on my journey on how to come back home because where I live trains end 12:30 am and so does the bus time. Usually when I go out to some places I can take night buses and then a final bus home but it takes me hours because I am financially not able to get a cab.
 
I asked her weeks before if they were driving there as they have a car so I could ask f it's possible to drop me home as they live around me. She said they were taking public transport but we would figure it out. 

I said I'm not sure I'm able to come as I can't afford taking a cab home at the moment. 

AND I ALSO haven't spoken to her in years. Once a while I would respon to a snap story like 'this is cool and looks good.' But we don't talk so I'm surprised. 

I usually don't go out when I'm invited but say I would come but cancel last minute because I get anxiety so I just couldn't. But yesterday I was looking at how to get back home if I did show and told her I was looking at the journey.

 If I could come I will and if I can't I'll stay shortly. But on my way home I realised it wouldn't be fun to bother going at all. I went home and I actually did fall asleep after a long day at work until 10:30pm. 

She messaged me asking where I was and I told her I fell asleep after work because I was exhausted. I had plans to go to a nerd game near me to play mtg instead of going out for one hour and heading back home. 
This morning she responded and said they was plenty of free cares that could have taken me home.

I said she didn't tell me that. 
One; I wouldn't know the person and I needed to feel safe. If she was in that car I would feel safer. 

And she said 'I literally said we will figure it out.' I told her I needed confirmation before I left my house. I have been to a friends bday party before and when I wanted to leave she told me we would figure out how to get home that I should stay till the end so I did. 

When time came I was asking her and she was so drunk and said I should get a Uber. I'm used to friends confirming I'll drop you home because I don't wanna go out with no money. I'm broke and saving.

 That friends entire friend GANGED UP ON ME saying I shouldn't have assumed I would be driven I home and I shouldn't come out to party if I had no money. I was like damn... y'all are right. I came to show support but I'm attacked for assuming.

43,1g1xrd9,AITA for wishing to live alone when my parents about to divorce?,"I (F24) don't have warm relationships with both of them. Dad is neutral, but my mom is hard to deal with as she is toxic. Living with her was so hard for me that I've had depression, took meds, and ""ran away"" from her when my EX offered me to live with him in his flat.

Our family has:  
(1) mom's flat, where she lives at and where I lived  
(2) grandma's flat, owned by my dad by inheritance  
(3) dad's flat where my brother and his family lives  
(4) brother's flat, bought with mom's partial help, now rented

All money from (4) rent go to the parent's summer cottage construction works. I.e. my brother is the landlord, but all the money go to my mom so she could build the cottage.

The situation: When I broke up with my ex and moved back to parents', she offered me to live at (2) flat. She promised that I will live there alone. My dad agreed with her, so I moved there. Everything was fine until now.

Recently, she called me and told that she initiates the divorce. So either I live with my dad where I am now, or come back to her, or rent something myself.

I've had a conversation with my dad, he understands my need to live alone, so he told me he doesn't want to bother me by living here. So we came to my brother and asked if it is okay to break the lease and let my dad live at apartment (4). It means that my mom will no longer have any rental money for her cottage. To my relief, he agreed.

When dad told this to my mom, she became furious. She called me, said that my wish to live in this apartment is luxury, that she invested in the (4) apartment, and the cottage she builds is not for her but for grandkids. Now she calls me every day saying the same thing over again and asking me to agree to live with my father or her, or go rent some apartment if my wish to live alone is so strong.

To clarify: Yes, I understand that with current prices, living alone is luxury. I understand that I really can just go rent myself (but with my current salary I actually can't). I understand that no one is obliged to give me a place to live.

BUT my mom does not need this money to survive. She lives in abundance, goes on vacation at least 2 times a year, buys a lot of unnecessary stuff. She can pay for cottage construction herself. But she does not want to spend her own money, because she has them from the apartment rent. And only because my brother is so kind to give them to her, even though he needs money too for his kids and unemployed wife. No one but her wants that cottage. This is entirely her intention to build it.

I just feel betrayed, because I was promised, and now this promise is about to break. I need to live separately for the sake of my mental health, and I have already invested a lot of money to buy things here. I think that having to rent an apartment, when my family has an option to give me a place to live, is unfair.

AITA for not agreeing to live with anyone?",Asshole,2024-10-12,"AITA for wishing to live alone when my parents about to divorce? I (F24) don't have warm relationships with both of them. Dad is neutral, but my mom is hard to deal with as she is toxic. Living with her was so hard for me that I've had depression, took meds, and ""ran away"" from her when my EX offered me to live with him in his flat.

Our family has:  
(1) mom's flat, where she lives at and where I lived  
(2) grandma's flat, owned by my dad by inheritance  
(3) dad's flat where my brother and his family lives  
(4) brother's flat, bought with mom's partial help, now rented

All money from (4) rent go to the parent's summer cottage construction works. I.e. my brother is the landlord, but all the money go to my mom so she could build the cottage.

The situation: When I broke up with my ex and moved back to parents', she offered me to live at (2) flat. She promised that I will live there alone. My dad agreed with her, so I moved there. Everything was fine until now.

   I do have to add some background! 

I have been trying to make plans with this long time friend for a MONTH. 
The first week I contacted her, she read my messages and didn’t reply. I waited a week before I confronted her about how I felt ignored, she gave the classic response of being busy. I accepted her apology and told her to let me know when she is free. No rush AT ALL. I made sure to work on her schedule and plan on HER time.

   3 weeks later she and I plan to hang out on a Thursday. Then she asked to reschedule to Friday which I agreed would be okay with me. Friday comes, I finished getting ready, and then she asks me if we can reschedule an hour before we are supposed to meet. At that point my patience was thin, because I have been trying for a month and waiting days at time for her to respond. I got the hint that she doesn’t want to hang out with me, so I told her that we don’t have to reschedule. She ended up blowing up on me saying I didn’t respect her boundaries and made her feel anxious because I “forced” her to make plans.

She had stage 4 brain cancer and yesterday they told us she had taken a turn for the worst and had merely hours left. I barely slept an hour last night, and I was really shaken up. This is the first time someone close to me has passed away. I have never even been to a funeral before.

My parents called me saying tey had been arranging her clothes etc and that the wake is today and the funeral is probably tomorrow. 

I was telling my boyfriend this, and saying that we would probably go with my parents to the wake for a little bit. My boyfriend then says ""I'm going to call my parents and tell them, see if they want to come too"". I was taken aback because his parents did not know my aunt at all, they don't even know my parents yet, have never even met them at all for the three years me and my boyfriend have been together.

47,1g1wxun,AITA for Pursuing Legal Action against a “Friend”,"I was part of a group savings scheme where my friend, “Jessica,” acted as the banker. The group works by having each member deposit an agreed amount monthly, and when it’s your turn, you receive the full amount collected. Everyone has to trust each other, which is why these groups are usually made up of friends or family.

When it was my turn to receive the payout, Jessica contacted me on 1/9 to confirm the account details, but after that, things started to go wrong. She delayed the payment, first blaming another member for being late. By 5/9, after I had followed up several times, Jessica admitted she had used my portion of the savings for an emergency and promised to repay it by 8/9. I was understanding and told her it was okay, just let me know next time.

However, 8/9 came and went with no payment and no response from her. I repeatedly tried contacting her—texts, calls, even reaching out to her roommate—but I was met with silence. By 13/9, I sent her a message saying we could make an arrangement that worked for both of us if she couldn’t pay right away. Still no reply. Later that day, I sent a message in the group savings chat asking if anyone had heard from her, and she responded by removing me from the group, accusing me of humiliating her publicly and getting a kick out of it.

I was shocked because that was never my intention. I’ve lent her money in the past and had no problem doing so again, but now I feel taken advantage of. After trying to work things out, I’ve decided to give her a final deadline to transfer the money. If she doesn’t, I plan to pursue legal action. This savings scheme is legal where I live, and with the proper documentation, I can file for debt collection.

Considering I’ve been patient and understanding throughout, AITA for wanting to pursue this legally after she’s ignored me?

EDIT: While I don’t know these people personally, they’ve been vouched for, and there’s a contract. Where I live, due to the common practice and deep-rooted tradition of this type of saving, the government recognizes its legitimacy. It’s not necessary to have a formal contract. If the banker fails to pay, it’s treated as a debt, and you can file for debt collection without a lawyer. The process is relatively simple, though I didn’t realize this because I’ve never had to file one before. In all the previous group savings I’ve joined, there were no issues. This case is an isolated incident in my experience. I understand how my post might make it seem like I got involved in a random scheme and was scammed, but that’s not what happened. My only concern is whether I might be the asshole for not giving her enough time or chances to make things right.

UPDATE: I’ve reached out to the other members and informed them about what’s been happening, and they’re just as shocked as I am. To clarify something I mentioned earlier - when Jessica’s account was hacked last April, I helped cover the funds, but she did pay me back. Only two members had transferred before the hack, and she was able to recover their money and her account, that’s how she paid me back. The remaining members then transferred directly to the person who was due to receive the payout in April.

You might wonder why the funds don’t just go directly to the corresponding member each month. The banker’s role is to make sure everyone deposits on time - they track and follow up with the members. If this was a scam, the April member wouldn’t have received their payout, no one else at work would have joined (like my colleague who’s using his savings for his baby’s arrival), and Jessica could’ve easily disappeared with the much larger amount I lent her before any of this happened.

The fact that she owes me less now suggests it’s not a simple scam. If it were, I’d be asking if I got cheated instead of worrying about whether I’m being the asshole. Jessica clearly has money troubles, but her poor communication and bad decisions forced me to take legal action.

My partner and I live together, needed another roomie to afford the mortgage. Long process, lots of interviewees, most had glaring character defects. This guy seemed normal and cool. Three weeks in, nothing glaring, some minor things but that’s life with a roomie.

My partner is out of town. New roomie got a cold, informed me to stay clear. Today he informed me he “borrowed” some of my coffee and “one shot of whiskey for a hot toddie”. He tried to pay me five bucks, I turned it down, not a big deal, I didn’t think anything of it and I didn’t check anything.

Tonight I got home from Uber driving, went to pour myself a nightcap, and discovered that 2 very special partial bottles of very expensive bourbon that my partner and I had been saving are now empty, two more special bottles that we’ve been saving have been opened and have significant volume missing.

We really need the rent. Otherwise this guy has been fine. But who the fuck finished fancy bottles of liquor that doesn’t belong to them?!?! And who the fuck cracks open fancy bottles of liquor that doesn’t belong to them?!?! Are we living with a psychopath? Or an alcoholic?
I plan to absolutely ream him out, no yelling, no name calling. But strongly point out the cost of the bottles, the sentimental value of the bottles, and how fucked up it is to just help yourself to other people’s stuff. I plan to not be condescending or treat him like a child, but I definitely want to get my point across in no uncertain terms that leaves him thinking and maybe feeling bad too.

My grandparents love to cook so it was fun and cool to learn from them and I picked up some recipes from them. When my parents heard this they added cooking 1 night a week once you're 13 to the list. I liked it because I enjoy my cooking more than my parents. Probably because I don't hate every second of cooking so I pay more attention.

My family preferred it too. Especially my siblings.

My sisters do not like cooking and our parents stopped the rule when both of them turned out to make shitty food. They didn't want to come home from work to eat bad food. They knew my sisters hated cooking too so they knew they wouldn't want to do better and my parents didn't blame them since they hate it. So my parents told me they wanted me to take over cooking 3 nights a week. I told them I wanted them to drop my chore of kid bathroom chore for the extra nights cooking chore.

I'm talking my sisters not disposing of their period pads well and sometimes leaving them, marks being left on the toilet seat, shit left in the toilet, all kinds of stuff in the shower. And one of my brothers pisses all over the place at night when he's half asleep so extra gross. My parents never try to anything about it but I hate cleaning that bathroom. I never want to use it. Sometimes I ask my best friends family if I can use theirs (they live right next door) because it's better.

My parents refused to drop that because they know my siblings won't clean it good and they don't want to do it either. So I said no to cooking three nights. My parents said I don't make the rules as the kid and I told them I refuse to take on more when I have the worst job in the house.

Her mother and I have had our differences, but I care about her. She can be very controlling at times, and it creates tension. She is known to argue frequently with her daughter (my fiance), and tries to dictate things. Also, I don't like the lack of privacy in general that comes with living under same roof.

It's uncomfortable.

She wants her to live 3 months with us, 3 months with her sibling, then back with us etc.. about 6 months/year.

Reason she wants her to live with us is because she had a minor stroke. She is ok, and does not need physical help, no need for custodial care and she can take care if herself (and she goes shopping likes crazy and frequently travels).

Fiance is simply scared it will happen again. And that she will be alone if it does. It's a scary thought.

She got pregnant 3 years later and he died before their son (aka nephew) was born. By that point their marriage hadn't been great and she admitted to me that she proposed because he'd wanted them to break up for good and she hadn't wanted that to happen. Despite them being bad together he was SO looking forward to being a father and had a little keepsake box he'd started when he fond out he was going to be a dad. I took that after he died and kept it safe because my sister wanted to throw it out. I knew one day my nephew might like to see his dad loved him even if they never got to meet. My sister has no idea.

Less than a year later she met her current husband and they got married after dating for 8 months. He adopted my nephew before his second birthday. They also changed my nephew's last name to reflect their marriage name/his adoptive father's name.

My sister did not allow her late husband's family to see my nephew and because she remarried, and he was adopted, our state did not allow for grandparents rights. They did try to seek some sort of legal access but my sister did not want nephew to know her husband was not his bio father.

I get 1 free tuition per year at my school. Eve goes for free. My husband M40 Seth thinks Amy and Greg should attend a great public school until 6th grade and then we can pay for them to go to my school for 7th to 12th.

To simplify it, Seth and I will have to pay a total of 8 years. When Eve graduates, my free tuition moves to Amy for 2 years and then to Greg when Amy graduates. There will be 3 years when we have to pay both Amy and Greg's tuition simultaneously. Tuition is $26k now with a 5% increase annually.

I want my children there with me. I had an idea to ask my parents for help with Amy and Greg for elementary tuition at my school. Seth said he thought my parents would turn me down and changed his mind. He calls me dumb because I should have had them pay from 7th grade then we wouldnt have any tuition to pay. Amy and Greg could go to the public school first.

Seth is jobless. He was hospitalized 2.5 years ago. We thought he might die. Seth recovered physically 2 months after, but has not been the same mentally. He went from being a confident, driven social butterfly to an anxious and always tired, preferring to avoid larger events and new situations. Seth has applied for very specific blue-collar jobs with limited recruitment openings and bi-annual application periods. He hasn't received callbacks and didn't perform as well as he would have prior to his hospitalization. Seth says he's trying, but I think he's picky. He is ineligible for unemployment or other aid. 

We have bills to pay. We have been digging into our savings for 2.5 years, 60% his and 40% mine. My monthly salary covers only 40% of our bills. I do a second job weekly, so covers 10% more. I did receive financial aid for Greg's preschool, so no bill for that! To add, Seth is a gambler, relying on stocks and lottery tickets as solutions.

Our savings before he was jobless was 91% of the tuition we'd need to start paying 7 years from now. I thought we'd dip into it a little while he recovered for a few months. Now it's been 2.5 years. We should be adding to our savings! Not depleting it...

He blames me weekly for ruining our lives. Seth says it is unfair of me to look to him to earn the most when I'm saddling us with a future debt 7 years from now. I have the stable job with health insurance, but no opportunity for wild salary increases. Seth had chances to seek careers that he is in control of his own success and it suited him because he has ADHD and he is (was?) so talented.

I'm frustrated. He's at home with no children. I tell him to get a job, any pay. My friend even offered him a job working 10 hours a week that would cover 30% of our monthly bills. Seth has excuse after excuse. The most used one is it's all my fault and I'll regret it when we can't afford tuition 7 years from now and must disenroll both Amy and Greg because I'm selfish. I want to speak to someone, but Seth won't. He claims I'll spin it so everyone takes my side. So Reddit, here I am!

57,1g1vcr0,AITA for not responding to a message that I had to translate in order to read? ,"Some background: I (31M) am a professional musician, a solo artist, and sometimes preparing for performances takes a lot of time. Like, a LOT of time. many hours of writing and proofreading (sheet music), putting together accompaniment tracks, loading sound equipment and instruments into the van, etc etc. Show days are always eventful days. 

I met Julio (38M) at the bar last week, and thought he was interesting and attractive. We danced, chatted, and had a good time together. Julio comes from Colombia, and doesn't yet speak much English. Thankfully, I grew up in a US state with a large Hispanic population, and have learned a small (but passable) amount of Spanish; so we are able to communicate a little. I'm really not that good at Spanish, though. When he texts me, it's entirely in Spanish (and I believe the 🇨🇴 dialect), which means I must do a little homework to translate the messages, and also reply back in Spanish. I don't really mind this... I like language, and study Japanese and Mandarin too, but it takes time. We had been meaning to meet up again at some point (it's been about a week since we met) but our schedules had not yet aligned, despite me asking what he was up to Wednesday night. (He replied, ""estudio"", which I take to mean he was studying - he is becoming a doctor.)

Fast forward to today, Friday. Today is a show day for me, and unfortunately I procrastinated, so I am quite swamped, with a lot to do in not a lot of time. Julio texted me a message that I couldn't instantly read around 1:30pm. I put it off, knowing I didn't have time. I am already a little on edge, as by this point I have to be loaded and in my car in 3 hours, and I am shaving it. 

I make it to the venue with just 20 minutes to spare before it's time for me to set up. There were very few moments to myself between setting up, sound checking, playing the show itself, and then socializing with and thanking the people that came. 

I arrived home around 11pm with new unread messages. Now, in my free time, I've gone to translate  them: 

1:30pm: 

""Hl if I could see you today or not at night""

7pm: (the start time of my gig - phone was off)

""Okay, I see you're very busy. Well, bye, take care.""

I sent a text after seeing these, saying basically ""sorry I missed you, I had an extremely busy day and had very little time for anything"".

There's a part of me that wants him to know that I wasn't snubbing him, that I had no conscious intention of ghosting or leaving him hanging, and that I just had the craziest day. 

But there's another part of me that thinks this is a red flag. It's not my fault that the communication is work for me; and we've only known each other for a week. So, I wasn't responsive for one day. Sue me? As I'm typing this, I'm feeling less and less like the asshole, hahaha 

But I'll still pose the question.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-12,"AITA for not responding to a message that I had to translate in order to read?  Some background: I (31M) am a professional musician, a solo artist, and sometimes preparing for performances takes a lot of time. Like, a LOT of time. many hours of writing and proofreading (sheet music), putting together accompaniment tracks, loading sound equipment and instruments into the van, etc etc. Show days are always eventful days. 

I met Julio (38M) at the bar last week, and thought he was interesting and attractive. We danced, chatted, and had a good time together. Julio comes from Colombia, and doesn't yet speak much English. Thankfully, I grew up in a US state with a large Hispanic population, and have learned a small (but passable) amount of Spanish; so we are able to communicate a little. I'm really not that good at Spanish, though. When he texts me, it's entirely in Spanish (and I believe the 🇨🇴 dialect), which means I must do a little homework to translate the messages, and also reply back in Spanish. I don't really mind this... I like language, and study Japanese and Mandarin too, but it takes time. We had been meaning to meet up again at some point (it's been about a week since we met) but our schedules had not yet aligned, despite me asking what he was up to Wednesday night. (He replied, ""estudio"", which I take to mean he was studying - he is becoming a doctor.)

Fast forward to today, Friday. Today is a show day for me, and unfortunately I procrastinated, so I am quite swamped, with a lot to do in not a lot of time. Julio texted me a message that I couldn't instantly read around 1:30pm. I put it off, knowing I didn't have time. I am already a little on edge, as by this point I have to be loaded and in my car in 3 hours, and I am shaving it. 

I make it to the venue with just 20 minutes to spare before it's time for me to set up. There were very few moments to myself between setting up, sound checking, playing the show itself, and then socializing with and thanking the people that came. 

I arrived home around 11pm with new unread messages. Now, in my free time, I've gone to translate  them: 

1:30pm: 

""Hl if I could see you today or not at night""

7pm: (the start time of my gig - phone was off)

""Okay, I see you're very busy. Well, bye, take care.""

I sent a text after seeing these, saying basically ""sorry I missed you, I had an extremely busy day and had very little time for anything"".

58,1g1v83k,AITA for Demanding Action After Human Waste Keeps Appearing in My Parking Spot?,"
I (29F) live in an apartment complex where I’ve been dealing with a pretty gross issue: human waste in my designated parking spot. This has happened three times in the last few months, with the most recent incidents on October 4th and 7th. I reported it to the property manager (PM) each time, but they only responded by cleaning the spot.

For context, my rent is in the mid-$5000s, and for this price, I think my living situation should at least meet basic sanitary standards.

After the third time, I sent an email to the PM detailing the problem, attaching photo evidence, and suggesting solutions like changing my parking spot, installing security cameras, or putting up warning signs. I also mentioned that if the issue couldn’t be resolved, I might have to consider requesting a rent reduction because this affects the habitability of my space.

Two days went by with no response, so I followed up and asked for the contact info of the PM’s supervisor if they couldn’t address the situation. PM finally replied, but their response was pretty hostile. They accused me of having “threatening intentions,” told me to “lower my tone,” and said they couldn’t reply right away because my email had gone to their spam folder. They did say they would clean up the mess but refused to change my parking spot or implement any security measures, which won’t prevent this from happening again.

I feel like I was just standing up for myself and my living situation, but now I’m wondering if I crossed a line. AITA for being prepared to escalate this issue to prevent future incidents?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-12,"AITA for Demanding Action After Human Waste Keeps Appearing in My Parking Spot?

me (F26) and my husband (M25) just moved to a more southern state because that’s where he was stationed and our town has a bar where they do line/swing dancing almost every night. back home we don’t have places like that but i’ve always wanted to do it. i danced when i was little and grew up dancing in my church (i have since deconstructed but i digress) its just in my blood, i love dancing and to me it’s not something that’s inherently sexual or romantic unless you choose to make it that way. 

because of my husbands job he can’t come with me during the week because he has to get up early (understandable) so i go with my female friend and we have a fun girls night. the bar opens at 9 and that’s usually the time my partner goes to bed to get up for work in the morning but every thursday, no matter that i spend the time with him from when he gets home till right before they open he gives me a hard time because im “leaving him” instead of going to bed with him. but im not tired and wouldn’t be going to bed anyways. 

so line dancing doesn’t have partners but swing does. i talked with my partner about swing dancing with other men. i made my case about how it’s not sexual to me nor to the other people there (unless you make it so) it’s just a hobby. i said they have this thing where if you wear a bandana on your left side it means you’re married/taken and aren’t looking and that i would wear one. i stated that i wouldn’t do any inappropriate moves with the other men, for obvious reasons. my friend and i only drink water when we go so we’re not impaired to drive or otherwise. i tried to make every thing i possibly could clear that i was protecting our relationship while still wanting to dance. i was trying to compromise and he still says it makes him uncomfortable. i asked him why and he said it’s because hes disappointed and wants to do that with me but because he can’t i’m going to other men to do it. like ?? that shouldn’t be how you’re looking at it because that’s definitely not how it is. i would love to swing dance with him and would go again on days he could but im not “replacing” him. it feels controlling and icky but he just feels like i don’t care about his feelings so idk. aita?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-12,"AITA for swing dancing with other people AITA?

62,1g1ucvu,AITA for “shutting down my living room”? ,"I (22f) am a married (27M) sahm with a 15mo daughter. Recently my family came to visit us for a week. My mom (41) is staying in our spare bedroom. My Aunt&Uncle came with their kids as well, but they are staying in a hotel. 

I told my mom that I have rules about my home, pretty simple rules, nothing over the top. No shoes on the rug, don’t eat food in the living room (drinks and snacks are fine), put your dish in the dishwasher when done, and once I go to bed the living room is shut down. By shut down I mean- do not go in it. I clean my living room before bed. Vacuum the floors, fix and vacuum the cushions, wipe down the coffee tables, ect. 

Anyways- I go out to the living room in the morning and there is a cup ring on my coffee table (I HAVE COASTERS) , the cushions are messed up, and a red sauce stain on my rug. I was livid. Mainly of the sauce stain on the rug. The rug is literally brand new, and a light beige color. I waited until my mom woke up and confronted her about the living room. She told me I was being over dramatic, the stain will come out, the rule is stupid, blah blah blah. Long story short, I told her my house, my rules and if she couldn’t go by my rules she needed to leave. So, she left and went to my aunts hotel. My aunt is blowing up my phone telling me that I am being unreasonable and they paid all the money to come see us. I told her I wasn’t being unreasonable, I have very simple rules and I just wanted to be respected in my own home. 

Am I the AH? The stain won’t come out and I am extremely disappointed. I tried to move the rug around and have the coffee table cover it, but where it’s at there’s no way to hide it. 

EDIT- never did I tell her she couldn’t exit her bedroom. I have a kitchen island that has seats and a dining room where she could have eaten- plus the bedroom she was in has a tv and a couch. 
 
Also- it takes long to clean my living room because I go through the cushions to find snacks my daughter may have dropped throughout the day. My daughter is in the stage where she puts everything in her mouth- no matter what it is and I do not want her to eat old food. She also hides her cup which normally has milk in it. Where I live mice and pests are EXTREMELY common, the last thing I’d want is mice or roaches in my home because of loose food. 

Edit 2- The rule is not permanent! It is just until my daughter grows out of the stage of putting everything in her mouth. Also- my mom and I have never had a great relationship, so my going off the way I did is probably just pelt up emotions towards her. 

I have people over all the time and people commonly spend the night (mostly like a week at a time) and we’ve never had a problem, because my whole home is open to them. I just ask they don’t use the living room until morning, since my daughter will make a mess of it anyways. As I’ve stated in the comments- I do not pickup throughout the day and I know children are messy. If something drops on the rug I immediately clean it, it’s no big deal. The problem is- she left a red sauce stain on my beige carpet ALL night. I wouldn’t have cared if it wasn’t for the stain and the coaster ring. My mom isn’t and never has been a tidy person, but I always have been and did most of the cleaning growing up. 

Edit 3- I’m tired of seeing the “you have ocd” comments. To everyone saying this- you clearly do not understand what ocd is and you shouldn’t be diagnosing someone without a degree. 
It is NOT a compulsion to clean my living room. I put the mental energy to make sure it is clean ONCE A DAY. Plus- there are people insinuating that I need to keep it clean all the time, I do not. I clean once a day. Besides cleaning up my kitchen as I make dinner and If a drink spills I will spot clean the rug. It waits until my husband and child have gone to bed. I do it as a settle down, I like routines and it has become a staple of my alone time and routine. Idk about you, but I LOVE to wake up to my home clean, even if I know it will be destroyed throughout the day.

On Wednesday, my grandfather died. At this point my life feels like a cosmic joke, but I know that if I let myself grieve right now, I'm going to be unable to work and I can't afford that right now. So this weekend, I planned to remember them and grieve privately. I hate making a scene and empty pity makes me incredibly uncomfortable, so I don't typically let on when things like this happen. 

I sent a message to a group chat that Tori, Sarah, and I are all in asking for the typical weekend hangout to happen at Sarah's place this weekend because work had been stressful and I needed some quiet, alone time. Sarah responds by asking if she could come over to the apartment for a bit because she ""misses Groose [the cat]"". I replied that I had just lost two grandparents, and I really needed the personal space. 

Sarah responds again with this: ""Oh no, I’m so sorry! That’s really hard. I totally hear that request and I don’t want to be a jerk, but might there be a couple hours when you’re already planning to be out of the apartment for something? I get that quiet need but I’d love to see Groose even for an hour or two""

I was flabbergasted and speechless. I honestly don't know how to respond. I didn't think it so unreasonable a request, but am I just being a jerk for breaking our weekly hangout?

TLDR: My grandparents died and I don't feel like socializing this weekend. My friend keeps insisting.

I (27, female) live with a roommate (27, female) and we have a mutual friend (27, female) (platonic, but an amiable ex of roommate) who stays with us most weekends so we can hang out. The friend 'Sarah' lives in the city and we live in the suburb, so Sarah stays with us because it's easier than commuting. Roommate, 'Tori', has a cat. End context.

I don't feel comfortable disclosing much about either of us personally. I'm posting this from a throwaway account.

I have severe autism, and my girlfriend (F) of about a year knows this, and knows that it effects my communication and how I conversate with people.

However, recently she has expressed to me (quite harshly,) that it seems to her that I'm making it about myself. 

The issue is, everything is always about her, throughout our entire relationship. She's always been a bit sensitive about things, and I've always done my best to accommodate that. However, any time I express I'm having a bad day, or that I'm stressed, or something large is happening, etc, it almost seems she's intentionally acting upset or in need. (note: I care for her and comfort her day and night, I think we've had more of me comforting her than conversations.)

I've never really had a day or event to myself without having to comfort her, and she does have a history of lying about things. I try really hard to trust her but it never ends up anywhere.

I'm not trying to demonize her in any way, she does try her best, but tends to get distant and snappy during any kind of serious conversation.

68,1g1sxdh,AITAH for calling my friends bullies?,"I (23F) am part of an awesome gaming club. We meet in person and have group chats. It started at my local college and after people graduated they kept the group going, and it’s now open to everyone ages 17+. A group of our size needs a lot of volunteers, so there is approximately 30 of them, some available at events and to message online should issues arise. They are fantastic at organizing our community, and on average are the nicest people I have ever met. They even helped me personally when I lost my dad last year. I cannot state how much I care for these people. I am friends with a lot of the volunteers, but 3 of them I am extremely close with and hang out weekly (Lincoln, Brody, Sam).

One instance a few years ago involved a small debate about religion with one of the volunteers, let’s call her Brittney. This did not happen at a group gathering. I was discussing my personal experience growing up and how things were interpreted in my faith, and Brittney kept interrupting me saying, “No,” and that that’s not what’s believed. I lived in a different country and practiced a different faith than her. I got frustrated and replied snarkily that it was my experience, and in turn she called me a B-word. A few days later I texted her an apology with an anecdote of a personal experience to hope she could understand where I am coming from. She never replied except a few weeks later where she said she never saw it but by then I had already deleted the message. A few months after this I was having an unrelated personal spat with Lincoln and he brought up my message with Brittney and used it against me in the argument. Turns out she sent it in volunteer group chat and complained about me to everyone while she ignored my message. This isn’t the only time where unrelated msgs have been sent to the whole team and gossiped about.

The final instance I want to discuss involves a removed member from our circle several years ago, let’s call him James. He was removed due to constantly causing debates with others and stomping on other’s opinions at meet ups, and just generally being a nuisance. He was 17 at the time and is neurodivergent. While that doesn’t excuse what he did I think it is worth mentioning as after he was kicked volunteered friend Sam (age 25+) dressed up as them to  “scare” other members, and gathered newbies to tell them the “horror story” of this kid on Halloween.

There are more instances but these are two of the biggest. This is where I may be the AH. Sam mentioned this year that they wanted to dress up as James again and repeat the same joke as it was so funny the time before. I snapped and told that it’s not funny and that they’re being bullies, and brought up the above. They’ve said that I was being unreasonable and overreacting, and that James was a jerk anyway.

69,1g1svde,AITA for telling the servers in my restaurant to stop messing with my kitchen workflow?,"So, I’m (29M) a head chef at a pretty busy restaurant, and I’ve been working in kitchens for over a decade. I love my job, but it can be a high-stress environment, especially during the dinner rush. Recently, we’ve had some issues between the kitchen staff (my crew) and the front-of-house servers.

For context, servers at our place are notorious for being pretty demanding. They always want their tables’ orders out fast, which I get—that’s their job. But lately, a few of them have started getting way too comfortable walking into the kitchen and trying to tell us how to do our jobs.

For example, last week one of the servers (let’s call her Sarah, 24F) came back and re-plated one of the dishes because she “didn’t like the presentation.” She told me it looked “too messy” for her table of VIP guests. Keep in mind, this is a dish I’ve made the exact same way for months, and I’ve never had a single complaint about it. I told her the kitchen isn’t her space to control, and if she wants something changed, she needs to tell me first instead of messing with my food.

Then another server, Jake (22M), started coming into the kitchen and saying stuff like, “Hey, can you prioritize Table 3’s order? They’re in a rush,” as if we don’t already have a system in place for timing everything out. I get it, sometimes customers are impatient, but the servers don’t understand the flow of the kitchen, and them stepping in just throws everything off.

It all came to a head last night when we were slammed, and Sarah decided to tell one of my line cooks to remake a dish because “it looked overdone.” That was the last straw for me. I gathered all the servers after the shift and basically told them that they need to stop interfering with the kitchen’s workflow and stay out unless they’re delivering orders or asking about allergies/substitutions. I wasn’t rude, just firm.

Now, the servers are pissed, saying I’m being controlling and that it’s their job to make sure the customers get the best experience. They’ve been gossiping that I’m a “kitchen tyrant” and even complained to the owner, who’s staying neutral but said I should “try to keep things harmonious.”

A few of my kitchen staff think I was totally right to set boundaries, but now I feel like I’m stuck in this battle between keeping the kitchen efficient and not alienating the front-of-house team.

70,1g1ssw0,AITA for agreeing to a modeling gig with my friend’s dad?,"throwaway account because i didn’t want this tied to my personal account. 

so I 18F met my friend 19F back when i was a freshman in high school. our friendship has been pretty rocky since our personalities clash, but we’ve always pulled through our struggles. we stopped being friends for about 8 months due to some stupid argument, but became friends again in march 2024. we’ve both been working on ourselves to be better friends and we haven’t even had an argument since becoming friends again. 

well that was until a couple weeks ago. her dad messaged me asking if i was interested in a part time modeling gig because he wanted to build a website for his photography. i was slightly taken aback so i messaged my friend. she thought it was a little weird but was as interested as i was. (they have a pretty rough relationship because he had a tendency to be neglectful throughout my friends childhood). so he messaged me again and said he would pay me for it. he has been doing photography for a while but mainly did scenery photos. he explained that he wanted to expand his hobby to actually make money. it seemed legit so i went through with it. 

we met at his house (my friend no longer lives there) and he offered to take me to the location so i could save gas. the shoot was normal and we were there for under an hour. he paid me VERY well afterwards. he made some slightly off-putting comments to me during the shoot but i thought i was being dramatic because i have a fear of men lol. i don’t remember exactly what he said but i think it was just compliments. it just seemed weird bc ik how he treats his daughter. 

so i was talking with my friend after the shoot and we laughed about it because it was kinda weird but not that big of a deal. her dad messaged me that night asking if we could shoot more pictures the next day since there were some pics that didn’t turn out like he wanted. i agreed. right when i pulled up to the house i got a weird gut feeling. ik that i should’ve listened but i also have multiple anxiety disorders, so if i always listened to my gut then i would literally never leave my bed. i decided that i would drive myself to the location just in case. when i walked into the house he brought me to his computer to show me the pictures from the day before. when he turned on the computer my face went pale. it was a ZOOMED IN photo of my tits. he clicked off right away and swore that it was an accident. i didn’t know the software so i didn’t know if it was like a double click to zoom in so i tried to calm myself down. i was trying to give him the benefit of the doubt as much as possible bc who wants to think of someone you trusted, that you’ve known for FIVE YEARS, like that? after quickly scanning through the photos we left in separate cars. i called my friend on the way to the location and i was nervously trying to laugh it off. i was uncomfortable but it was such a weird situation to be in. my friend was also uncomfortable and awkwardly laughing it off with me, and we decided that i would make up an excuse to leave early. so i was at the location for barely 30mins before i left and he paid me very well again. 

i kept thinking about the situation throughout the rest of the day and i felt nauseated. i decided that i would make up some sort of excuse to never take photos again. my friend called me later that evening and she BLEW UP at me. she said things like “do you like entertaining my dad?” “is this all for attention?” “idk why you were laughing, is this a joke to you?” i was so thrown off. i was already planning on stopping because i was uncomfortable, but i was so confused how she could interpret that i had those intentions. i guess the laughing was wrong, but that’s what i do when im uncomfortable idk. she didn’t let me get much of a sentence in before she continues “idc if you keep taking photos with him but i don’t want to fucking hear about it, it’s nasty and fucking weird”. then i finally talked and said that i was already planning on stopping, and that i was sorry because i didn’t realize she felt so strongly about it because she didn’t say anything like this before. we continued to talk a bit and she eventually apologized for blowing up at me and she said she was going to talk with her mom about it (we didn’t know if she even knew this was going on ) and that she would eventually confront her father. she said she would let me know how it goes. 

about an hour after the call i messaged her apologizing again because i felt so guilty about the whole thing. she never even opened it. a few hours after that i messaged her on a different platform asking is she was awake, and she responded “yeah, why”. i apologized again and she never responded. it has been damn near a month now and she hasn’t responded or reached out at all. 

her father messaged me a couple days after asking if i could stop by, and i made up an excuse to not. he messaged me a few days after that with more of the pictures that were finished editing. he told me he was going to print some out to see how they looked on paper and asked if i wanted any printed. i never responded to any of these. he messaged me about a week after asking if he did anything to upset me or if the pictures were just bad. i responded saying that i was busy, i didn’t need anything printed, and that they looked fine. he messaged me earlier this week telling me to please delete any photos that i might have saved that he sent me. he unsent ever photo that he had previously sent me. 

so i’m guessing she confronted him. this whole situation is making me so unbelievable anxious and i feel so bad thinking i probably caused so many issues in their family. i want to talk to her, but she obviously doesn’t want to speak to me. i understand why she’s upset, but i can’t see why i was to blame. i’m upset with myself for being naive but im also upset with her but i don’t think it’s fair for me to be upset with her. sorry for such a long post, i just really need an unbiased opinion because i feel like garbage, but everyone in my life is saying that i wasn’t in the wrong. so, AITA?

tl;dr- i agreed to do a modeling gig with my friends dad, but realized he might have bad intentions. my friend blew up at me blaming me for the situation. now she won’t talk to me and im pretty sure i caused a lot of problems in their family. AITA?",,0.04259465,0,0
71,1g1sjye,AITA for judging my friend for liking a movie?,"I (29M) went with my friend (37F) and my husband (28M) to see a movie last night - specifically Terrifier 3. If you aren’t familiar with the movies, they are horror films that focus a lot on the blood and gore and consistently push the envelope with their graphic practical effects. The first one was already pretty uncomfortable, the second was disgusting, and going into the third one I knew was going to be even more over-the-top. I loved the first two, though, and if the films escalated in the same way or at the same pace, the third would  have been a blast. 

However, without spoiling it, the first 20-30 minutes of the movie was some of the most uncomfortable media I have ever consumed. While the first two balanced the horrific violence with a creepy villain and lots of humor, the opening of this movie was just bleak and exploitative shock value for the sake of shock value - the kind made just for people to say “I watched Terrifier 3 and liked it because that stuff doesn’t bother me” and it’s a red flag. If you have ever seen or heard of A Serbian Film, kind of like that.

Honestly the remaining 90 minutes was great. Disgusting, and definitely far more intense than the first two, but in the way I was expecting and excited for. Unfortunately, because the first part was so upsetting, I was overwhelmed and exhausted. I had a hard time letting go of that and enjoying the depravity.

Leaving the theater, I was silent. I did not have a good time and I didn’t really want to talk about the film. However, my husband and my friend were both raving about it - how funny it was, how disgusting it was, discussing the parts that made them cover their eyes or squirm. And I was just silent.

When we got in the car, I told my husband that I did not have a good time and was kind of surprised by his and my friend’s reactions. He explained why he enjoyed it and said I sounded a bit judgmental. I told him no, just didn’t like it.

But really I am judging both of them - especially my friend for how much she was laughing throughout the film, including the most unnecessary parts. I just don’t understand finding enjoyment out of some of the scenes in the opening, and I don’t think it’s normal. But also, my husband says I just shouldn’t have gone to see the movie if I couldn’t handle some of the content in it, and that I can’t judge someone for enjoying it.

72,1g1scv0,AITA for refusing to jump start someone’s car at the carwash?,"Hey all,

Fridays are pretty hectic for me, and something that I end up doing to both decompress and be productive is to wash my car on the way home. It’s an automatic car wash so afterwards all I do is dry my car with the rags they provide. 

I was in the middle of cleaning my car’s license plate when I get approached by a lady who asked if I could jump start her car. She said that she had the cables and that her battery got drained from her bumping her music. Idk how long she was there, but yeah when I arrived she was there playing her music and cleaning her car. Anyways, she didn’t let me answer before she told me she would be waiting for me whenever I was finished. 

I told her no, as I had just gotten off work and wanted to get home after cleaning my car. She changed her customer service voice right away and scoffed and saying “oh my god” as she walked off. I understood her frustration, but his was the excuse that required the least mount of effort on my part as I was exhausted and I didn’t want to jump start someone’s car for them, my car was just wet as hell from the car wash, it’s night time, and with previous jumps from people who “knew how to do it” my car ended up smelling burnt afterwards. 

I’m a woman, heavily tattooed, so maybe she thought I would know how to jump cars but I only know how to jump cars using YouTube or Wikihow.

 I always watch it while doing the jump start. Maybe it’s very sexist of me to think that this lady wouldn’t know how to do it and I would have to do everything for her, and jumping cars makes me anxious due to it being improperly done in the past to my car. 

I get it, jumping someone’s car isn’t something you HAVE to do but it’s a courtesy on the streets. 

To be completely transparent, I did feel some type of way when she assumed I’d say yes, but didn’t even give me a chance to ask her if she knew how to do it properly. So I just said no without a reason besides I wanted to go home after being at work all day.

She asked one of the many other 12 dudes also drying their cars to help, which 1 did. As I was pulling out I looked over and the guy was doing the cables for both cars and she got the help she needed.

I feel like an asshole with how I went about it. If I am indeed the asshole, would it be better in the future to just say yes and let them do it? Is the burnt smell in my car just a coincidence? Does the order of how the connectors are placed matter? Everyone does it out of order, sometimes connecting the cables to the live car while it’s already on and sometimes doing it with the car off (not always on my car).

73,1g1sav7,AITA for telling my boyfriend no? ,"
I(22F) have been with my boyfriend(26M) for four years. Something to know, I grew up with people who were addicted to all kinds of shit. I’m talking pain pills, harder drugs, the works. I suffered because of their choices, went without so they could get high. Pain pills are already iffy for me, I don’t feel comfortable being around them, or taking them. 

Now, two days ago, my tooth broke while I was eating. I went to work, I’m a broke 22 year old, I had to go. Until the pain got so bad, I had to stop by an emergency dentist. The game plan was to take a long lunch, get my tooth filled, and clock back in for work. Turns out, I needed a root canal, and I have a high tolerance to numbing agents. So they just periodically numbed me up throughout the procedure. I felt a bit, it wasn’t too terrible, but I was so sore, I couldn’t go to work. 

I finally got my medication today, I had an infection, so I got antibiotics and some higher grade Tylenol with Vicodin. I’ve only taken one, and that’s so I could eat. Well my boyfriend has does warehouse work for years, his back is pretty messed up. I’ll give him that, man is always hurting. We have a little medicine cabinet just for both of our pain management—like ibuprofen, heating pads. 

He got the bright idea to ask me for one of my pain pills. I told him no. This dude pouted, I told him I’d never give anyone pain medication that was prescribed for me. I grew up with people selling their pills or people buying it so they could abuse it. Now I don’t think my boyfriend would do that, but the underlying issue is that he knows about my past. And still had the nerve to kinda give me shit for it. 

He said something along the lines of “well I’ve given you my medication before”. Yeah, an antibiotic, that I cleared with his mom(used to be a nurse) that it was safe to take. That happened two years ago. I explained the above to him, and he got shitty, apparently under the impression id think he would do something and abuse it. It’s my boundary, I don’t give a fuck. 

So Reddit, I don’t really feel like an asshole, but am I one for telling him no?

76,1g1ryxm,AITA for accidentally yelling at an autistic person? ,"I’m not totally sure how to go about telling this story. But it took place over two separate occasions, so I’ll start with the first one. 

About a month ago, my mom (51f), my boyfriend (17m), and I (17f) were at a popular theme park in our area. We were all standing in line for a ride when a park employee walked past us. He was giving my bf a strange look. We all noticed, but didn’t say anything. It was kinda funny at the time. The employee kept walking back and forth past us, genuinely just staring at my bf the whole time. This went on for a few minutes, until we got on the ride and then we didn’t see the employee again that day. 

Fast forward to today. The three of us were at the theme park again. And again, THE SAME EMPLOYEE was literally just staring at my bf. This time we were really weirded out. The first time it happened, we chalked it up to being a weird fluke. But now we were all honestly creeped out because what are the chances that the same employee does the same thing to my bf again?? 

And this time it was even worse. The employee actually was following us for a bit. Like genuinely he was walking right next to us, never breaking his stare at my bf. We were trying to just ignore him. 

But he wouldn’t stop following us, and wouldn’t stop staring. So we spoke up. 

My mom asked him to knock it off. I asked what was his problem? We were kinda yelling, not fully but louder than a talking volume. 

The employee then pointed to a pin on his badge that said “captain autism”. We automatically felt bad. We wouldn’t have been so aggressive if we knew he was autistic. 

I’m being genuine when I say I feel bad. But also, are we in the wrong? From our point of view, we were being followed and very uncomfortable. It feels like he knew what he was doing, because he kept doing it even after this altercation. We didn’t say anything else to the employee, but it felt like he just showed us his autism badge to get out of the situation? Honestly I’m not super familiar with autism, but you would think he might get the hint to stop following us after our conversation?

77,1g1rps0,AITA for talking about abuse in my support group?,"Hi everyone,

So I’ve been dealing with a debilitating chronic illness for many years. I’ve been hospitalized multiple times in the past year. As a result of my illness I’ve also had to move back in with my family who act as my caregivers. Unfortunately it’s been a very mentally/emotionally abusive situation with one of my family members taking financial advantage of me and telling me I’m a burden, I’m such a loser for getting sick, I’m being abusive for needing to be taken care of due to my illness, etc. 

As a result of all of this, I’ve joined a support group for people with chronic illness and started therapy. People talk about all sorts of trauma in their life and how it’s been impacted by their illness. This includes really intense topics like sexual assault, thoughts of unaliving, narcissistic family members, being 5150ed, etc. 

I started talking to one of the members outside of the group and everything seemed fine. She would share her trauma, I would share mine and we both try to be supportive of each other. Most of it would have to do with how emotionally abusive our families are and how it impacts our health. Their feedback was consistently that I should cut off contact with my family, stop giving them attention, etc. I tried to explain to this person that that’s not an option for me since I have to live with someone who has to be my caregiver and I’m not sure if my insurance would currently approve another option. They are not in the same situation as me (they can live independently) so I think it was difficult for them to understand my situation. 

They would always basically try to give me advice. I would thank them but gently try to tell them in so many words that I didn’t really want advice, I just needed support. 

Then one day out of (seemingly) nowhere, this person began to tell me to that they are not a therapist, and that if I’m not ready to basically do something about my situation (like completely cut my family off even though that would essentially leave me homeless) that they can’t listen to me anymore and they just don’t want to hear about it anymore. 

I responded by saying that I didn’t think that was fair since I was never even really looking for advice to begin with, just support. Even then, I said that was fine and I basically just stopped talking to this person.

The AITA moment comes in here - because the next thing I knew the moderator of the group (who was also my therapist) pulled me aside and told me that my family situation is too overwhelming for “some members” and asked me not to talk about the abusive situation I’ve been going through anymore. Which I’m happy to do. But I also think is totally unfair since literally almost everyone in the group is talking about super overwhelming topics, including being in abusive situations with their families. This includes the person who told me they “didn’t want to hear about it anymore”. It just feels like I’m being singled out.

I had what it probably my last conversation the aforementioned person in which they alluded to me doing something offensive during our last group session (I had no idea what she was talking about) and telling me I was self-centered for not thinking of the group first. 

I’ve just been in a very fragile place between my family and all of my medical issues and it’s just been a very invalidating experience and it’s just added more trauma to what has already been a pretty traumatic time. 

If this person would have reached out to me and discussed this issue and the fact that they were feeling overwhelmed by my situation I would have been pretty responsive and stopped talking about it with them. Instead, they kind of just blew up one day and lashed out. 

So my question is AITA for talking about my (admittedly) overwhelming situation in my support group? Am I being self-centered here as this person claims by not putting the group first? 

Or are they one for not being more communicative about their feelings then trying to basically block me from talking about my situation not only with them but with anyone else in the group?

Or is it the moderator for not doing a better job at moderating this situation? What do you guys think? ",,0.0058030495,0,0
78,1g1rn51,AITA for going off on my sister because she won’t reschedule her baby shower because of the hurricane? ,"I (20F) have a sister (23F) who is currently pregnant. We found out in March and we could not be more excited. She decided to throw a baby shower, and so me and my mom (50f) bought a whole bunch of things for her. For context, my sister lives where Hurricane Milton hit, and so leading up toward the day we planned to leave (we live a couple states away, which is about a 12 hour drive not taking into consideration stopping for gas and bathroom.), we made sure to constantly check on the Hurricane patterns so we would know whether or not to postpone or leave day. When Hurricane Milton became a Category 5 and evacuation orders were put in place, her husband asked her if they want to reschedule the baby shower so everyone can get there safely, including me and my mom. She said “No, I’m tired of hearing about the hurricane, the weather is supposed to be beautiful after the hurricane. I’m not canceling.” 

Hurricane Milton hits landfall, and their area is completely flooded and there’s debris everywhere. They lost power as well as a lot of their friends and family. Still, despite this, baby shower on.

Flash forward to today. We woke up around 2 in the morning to pack up our truck to head to Florida. The first couple hours go by smoothly, and then we end up getting stuck in traffic for two hours because of a wreck. That pushed our ETA back two hours. As we get closer, we are faced with more and more traffic of people returning from hurricane evacuation, and our ETA begins to reach into the late hours of the evening. Our final ETA was 1 AM before we hit a breaking point.

Me and my mom both were beyond exhausted. She was bobbing her head at the wheel and her eyes kept closing as we drove. Me, I was so exhausted and nauseated that I was hallucinating. However, we still had a good three hours of our trip left. After I told her we have to park somewhere, we ended up parking at a truck stop. My sister then calls my mom to check on her, and says “Tell (My Name) to get her fucking ass in the driver’s seat and drive.” My mom answers, “Honey, (my name) is just as exhausted as I am and she’s also autistic, she’s never driven a truck this size before.” (For context: yes I am autistic, and my dad has one of those absolutely massive chevy trucks where I can literally stand in it if I bend my body.) 

This is where I start to lose it because I’m loopy and I’m extremely overwhelmed with everything. I tell my sister “You could have easily rescheduled this for another day. A hurricane literally blew through your town, people died, people lost their homes. We are doing all we can.”

She hasn’t responded to me. Currently I’m staying awake with my mom at a truck stop making sure she gets some sleep. I’m so close to passing out I don’t even know how I’m writing this. But I feel like I kinda went too hard on her.. I mean, she’s my sister and she’s pregnant. She didn’t evacuate for the hurricane because she said it wasn’t that big of a deal, and that she was tired of hearing about it. 

AITA?

EDIT: Y’all, I posted this to get some helpful advice, not get DMs where I’m called slurs and told to “get a normal brain” because I mentioned a disability I have. Please don’t send me these things. I know it’s hard for some people to comprehend, but respect goes a long way.

EDIT 2: Currently driving to my sister’s house.. We have less than an hour before we’re there and the traffic seems to be less congested. Not a religious person whatsoever but let’s hope that some force out there is strong today and on my side.

UPDATE: We arrived safely at my sister’s house. Any kind of problems or drama have all just blown over because we’re all just happy to be together safely. 

FINAL UPDATE: Hi everyone! Thank you for all the comments and giving your perspective on things. It helped me realize that I really should put my foot down more often and try to be more firm with my family. Being the youngest out of three is not for the faint of heart lol. Anyway, the baby shower happened, and it actually went really well. Everyone who RSVP’d showed up, it was about 30 people or so. Everyone was smiling, laughing, and having an amazing time. It was a long day of decorating and preparing food, but it was totally worth it at the end of the day. I love my family so much.

81,1g1qhla,AITA For refusing myself after an heated arguement while Girlfriend plays board game with friends in the other Room?,"For context: My girlfriend(23f) was prepping for her sister and some friends to come over for board games and asked me(23m) for help moving a puzzle onto a tray of cardboard to clear up a surface, so I tried sliding the cardboard under while she slid the puzzle on top, pieces ended up everywhere, but she gets up storms off saying ""fuck it, I'm going to take a shower, you do it"". I sit dumbfounded since she told people to come at 5pm and I still had to work for my corporate job till then. I got ready upset because she left me the choice of either do my job and leave a giant mess for guests or put the puzzle back together and risk my job for a puzzle.

Seeing as I didn't want to embarrass my Girlfriend or myself to our guests, I got to work putting the puzzle back together. She comes back half an hour later and then asks me for more help to do something else. This started an argument where I called her out for just leaving to play a much more painful 52 pickup while she went off to take a shower. She then yelled at me that she had been doing things all day to prep and that I was barely working (I'm the breadwinner). She was also upset that the puzzle hadn't been moved when she asked me to do it the weekend prior (which I pointed out I had fallen ill during). I apologized for that, but pointed out the reason I was upset was that she asked me to help her do something with her, and in that process, something happened that made the task significantly larger, and then she immediately absolved herself of the responsibility and walked away. She then says she gets that I feel ""abandoned"" but since she says she's constantly feeling that way it's ok. I drop this conversation since at this point I'm not getting an apology for literally being left to clean up her mess

Around 5:30 she asks if I still have work, and I say yes and they can have dinner without me. I then tell her I'm not in the mood for board games so I probably won't come out of the room to play with her friends. She immediately says that I am punishing her for us having a heated argument for not joining for the even she planned. I try telling her that I am not trying to spoil her night, but rather since my mood has already been spoiled and I wanted to recuse myself to prevent doing the same to others.

82,1g1qaze,AITA for not want my partner to do nitrous in the loungeroom and playing games when she is napping on the couch?,"First a bit of context.  
My partner suffers from poor mental health - This has been off and on for the last 10 years however in the last 6 months it got particularly bad and long story short she has picked up the habit of doing nitrous oxide from balloons in recent months.

This is something I have really struggled with as I feel that it actually puts her in a worse state after she has done it and while we used to do nitrous recreationally with friends at parties it has become a thing that she does several times a week - even coming home from work early to sit on the couch and do it for the rest of the day (which was very alarming to see the first time). I obviously want her to stop, however it is an extremely volatile situation as she is quite sensitive and feels she needs it to cope.

For me personally the second I hear the balloon inflate (its extremely loud) my gut drops and I am stuck in this situation where I feel like I am either enabling her by letting her do it, or taking away the thing she feels helps, a lose-lose situation.

Currently I try to gently deter her and tell her she does not need it as anything more direct could (and has in the past) adds more stress and pressure to her and can make things worse.

  
The house we rent has only 1 room that is super comfortable with our couch, tv, computers etc - this includes my computer in which on the weekends I often play video games with some of my buddies on discord - this is my me time and helps me deal with everything in my own way.

  
Some days my partner will play music quite loud and do nitrous which is very loud. The music I do not mind - its loud but I can deal. However the sound of the balloon being explosively filled every 30-45 seconds for hours on end - not only drives me crazy because of the sheer sound but also is picked up by my mic, meaning I can't hang out with my friends without getting questions about ""wtf is that sound?"" which I am very anxious and unsure how to answer. I could use push to talk however I will inevitably speak right as one is being blown up and have the same problem. Beside this - it is just generally hard to hear people when they are going off.

That is my perspective - Her perspective is basically - This is my house and I should be comfortable to do what I want in my own house.

On the flipside of this the other problem we have had recently will fall asleep on the couch - and when I go to watch something or play a game/talk to friends she gets quite upset and annoyed with me for waking her up. I do often put the headset on when she is sleeping however if I am on discord I admit I tend to talk louder as I cannot hear myself - I should work on that but its hard to notice until its too late.

Of course my parents took the master bedroom on the first floor and my little sibling took the room next to my parents upstairs because they were like 1-5 at the moment.

I told them it was unfair we had to help them clean their basement but never helped us keep our basement clean and always put the main problem in the basement everyday. They got mad at me every time I refused and they called me spoiled and talked about kicking me out at 18 if I don’t start helping around the house (which I already do, I clean the kitchen, the upstairs bathroom, me and my sisters shared room which my sister never helps me clean, the upstairs living room, doing dishes, cooking dinner, etc) and I’m worried they’ll hold this over my head when I turn 18 next month?

Most of us kept our distance from the basement most of the times and only ever went down there to talk to our parents or do laundry. The basement became a mess with tones of clothes from the laundry room and our parents wanted our help cleaning the basement. I refused for the longest time because I told them that this was their mess and we had no part in it. I told them it was unfair we had to help them clean their basement but never helped us keep our basement clean and always put the main problem in the basement everyday. They got mad at me every time I refused and they called me spoiled and talked about kicking me out at 18 if I don’t start helping around the house (which I already do, I clean the kitchen, the upstairs bathroom, me and my sisters shared room which my sister never helps me clean, the upstairs living room, doing dishes, cooking dinner, etc) and I’m worried they’ll hold this over my head when I turn 18 next month?

Ok. I’ll try to keep this brief. 

My mother, wife, and 3 kids all live under the same roof. After my father passed away Mom was in a bad stretch and suggested she sell her house and we all get a house for everybody so she wouldn’t be alone.  And we could keep an eye on her when her health will eventually fail.  She’s 73, I’m 47, kids are 20, 19, and 7.   She owns the house but we pay every bill.  And when I mean every.  Every bill. Homeowner’s insurance, property taxes, electric, water, natural gas, pool maintenance, lawn maintenance, pet waste disposal. Everything.  

Now there’s a sticking point about food. She nearly refuses to cook for herself anymore. We’ve been in this situation over a year now.  She’ll just have what we have.  And we just cook extra since we’re cooking anyway. But she doesn’t contribute to the food bill at all. She buys her own food for breakfast and lunches and stuff. But the expectations are or seems like that we are to provide dinner.  

Eating out has gotten expensive. Especially these days with the economy.  But if we don’t want to cook it seems like she’s just happy with asking what’s for dinner. We telling her we’ll grab something and from wherever. And she’ll happily place an order.  She never offers to pay for her own.  Doesn’t say hey what’s my portion?  Have we asked?  No. How does one broach that?  Because eating out is about $15-$20/person now.  And that’s an easy $100. I’m sorry but I can’t really afford for everybody to eat out. 

She’s stingy.  She pulls in $5k/month from SS and IRA stipend.  WITH NO BILLS other than her health insurance and DirecTV.  Since we don’t watch TV much.  

Wife and I work full time. I’m out of the house 12 hours a day.  She’s a dog groomer from home and she does well with that.  

So. Are we the assholes if we say “hey we don’t want to cook, if you want us to grab something please shoot us over the money for it. Or heat up something in the kitchen (leftovers etc etc)”.

Last year, he came to my family's thanksgiving dinner, and I went to his. Considering that we are in a long-term relationship and that we both went to each other's dinners last year, I thought it would be safe to assume that we would go to each other's dinners again this year, no?

Well, about a week ago, I asked what day he was free so my family could plan a good day to have our dinner so that he could join, and he told me that his friend invited him for thanksgiving weekend (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) to his cottage with some other friends, so he wouldn't be able to come to my dinner. He said that in the moment, he forgot that my family was going to be having our thanksgiving dinner, and since I hadn't mentioned anything about it yet, he didn't have any plans at the time when his friend invited him, so he said yes.

I guess he has a point about how he technically didn't have any plans at the time when his friend invited him, but it threw me off how he was leaving for the weekend with his friends instead of spending time with me and my family. It's not like we're a married couple or anything, but it rubbed me the wrong way. I also want to make it clear that he has NEVER prioritized his friends over me, so this was a first, although he technically didn't prioritize them over me because we didn't have plans yet. It just hurt that it didn't cross his mind that my family would invite him.

I already told him how I felt about it when he first told me that he wouldn't be able to come over, and we talked it through and I thought everything was fine. But now that it's becoming real and thanksgiving weekend is here and he's at the cottage with his friends, I can't shake off the fact that I'm still slightly annoyed about it. Especially since I'm still going to his house on Monday for his family's thanksgiving dinner. I feel like I'm probably overreacting but it's really bothering me right now and I don't want to start anything again because I don't want to ruin his weekend with his friends right now.

Part of me wants to get back at him by not going to his thanksgiving dinner since he's not going to mine. But I would feel bad for cancelling at the last minute and causing issues not only with him but also with his family.

92,1g1oztr,"AITA for calling my coworker a bad storyteller, and weird for texting me on my day off?","AITA for calling my coworker a bad storyteller, and weird for texting me on my day off?

Disclaimer: I haven't posted on reddit since I was a teenager, been solidly lurking, so sorry if the format is off. 

I (24f) have a coworker, Arjun (25m) who sucks at telling stories. He takes way too long to get to his point, and usually his stories don’t even really have a point. There’s no interesting conflict or express beginning, middle, or end. 

Today, I had the day off. Arjun texts me in the middle of the day, across around 5 long texts altogether back to back, to tell this story:

He was working with another coworker of ours Mary (40s f) at an information desk in our museum. A young lady comes up and asks for a trash bag, because her sister (nowhere to be seen) was feeling sick and might barf. Mary tells her to just go to the bathroom, but the young lady said her sister felt too sick to even move. 

Arjun goes to our office two floors away and gets a spare trash bag from a cabinet, but by the time he comes back, the young lady is gone. He looks around for her and even gets Mary to check in the women’s bathroom (???). 

And… that’s it. That was the story. What’s even more confusing, is I know there’s a small wastebin that rarely gets used at that information desk. If anything, it might’ve had a couple of balled up sticky notes in it but nothing else. I asked why he didn’t just take that trash bag out and offer it to the young lady? But Arjun said she was “already gone” by the time he thought of that. Which is confusing, because did he really not think about that until after going to our office two floors away for a bag?

All in all the story was not entertaining and I’m confused why he shared it with me.

He seemed disappointed in his response and hasn’t texted me any more today, which is fine by me. 

Now, i mentioned this to a couple of our other coworkers who I’m actually friends with outside of work. They said I was a little cruel and should’ve been nicer. They also said it’s “obvious” Arjun has a crush on me and just likes talking to me, so I should be more gentle. I can deal with that at work, but I shouldn’t have to dodge it on my days off too. 

So, AITA? Should I have been nicer? Next time I’ll probably just ignore his messages if they’re weird/boring. ",Asshole,2024-10-12,"AITA for calling my coworker a bad storyteller, and weird for texting me on my day off? AITA for calling my coworker a bad storyteller, and weird for texting me on my day off?

Disclaimer: I haven't posted on reddit since I was a teenager, been solidly lurking, so sorry if the format is off. 

I (24f) have a coworker, Arjun (25m) who sucks at telling stories. He takes way too long to get to his point, and usually his stories don’t even really have a point. There’s no interesting conflict or express beginning, middle, or end. 

Today, I had the day off. Arjun texts me in the middle of the day, across around 5 long texts altogether back to back, to tell this story:

He was working with another coworker of ours Mary (40s f) at an information desk in our museum. A young lady comes up and asks for a trash bag, because her sister (nowhere to be seen) was feeling sick and might barf. Mary tells her to just go to the bathroom, but the young lady said her sister felt too sick to even move. 

Arjun goes to our office two floors away and gets a spare trash bag from a cabinet, but by the time he comes back, the young lady is gone. He looks around for her and even gets Mary to check in the women’s bathroom (???). 

And… that’s it. That was the story. What’s even more confusing, is I know there’s a small wastebin that rarely gets used at that information desk. If anything, it might’ve had a couple of balled up sticky notes in it but nothing else. I asked why he didn’t just take that trash bag out and offer it to the young lady? But Arjun said she was “already gone” by the time he thought of that. Which is confusing, because did he really not think about that until after going to our office two floors away for a bag?

It seemed like he wanted to brag to me about unsuccessfully trying to help a random woman lol. What's the point?

All in all the story was not entertaining and I’m confused why he shared it with me. I told him such (along with some tips about getting to the point faster while telling stories) and that I would prefer if he didn’t text me about work when I’m off, because that’s weird.

93,1g1oyu0,AITA for telling my mom I don't trust her or my dad?,"hey I'm 16f and my mom is always going on and on and on about how her and my dad want nothing but the best for me, that they know what's best for me and that I just have to listen. (In this case it was academically) (also my dad lives abroad and only visits so this convo happened w my mom)

but that's the thing, I don't believe that they do. I don't trust them at all. Ik it sounds lowkey harsh but here's some bg info. 

She's ripped up my textbooks the night before an exam and forced me to not study. Once I was 30 seconds late for the bus (as in it was just turning the corner as we got there) and my dad said he'd drop me off. He yelled for the next two hours, took a dump, watched the news, showered, got dressed, ate, then screamed at me in the car, then got pissed off when my school receptionist didn't let me in. I had a practical that day (worth 50% of my grade) that I missed and I got shit for it in the car (HE KNEW I HAD IT) and also later on when I got my report card. I had 98% in the theory part of the subject, but I failed because I didn't get to do the practical. My mom also has this thing where she was pissed off that I didn't study her way and that I studied during the night (I have a sleep disorder that makes it so im awake anyway). She's punished me for it a lot. They've both taken away electronics when I had to submit assignments and stuff. You get the drift. I won't talk about all the stuff to do with health and shit.

Anyway, I got sick of being told the same thing. ""do you think we're the enemy?"" And I said, ""yeah. You've never helped me, and I don't trust you to do so. You've never given me a reason to trust you. You've definitely given me reasons not to."" 

Obviously, she freaked out. Called me ungrateful. Said, ""fine, of course we're your enemy. to think you're so rude and ungrateful, what did we do wrong with you?"" got more pissed off and asked me if I ever even listened to them, that i changed the password on my phone and wouldn't tell her it (she kept snooping throguh my friends texts and blcoking them for no reason) and idk. 

maybe I was too harsh? I don't usually backtalk. I think I hurt her feelings again. Her reasoning for the stuff I said was that it was for the best and I just didn't see it. that they were trying to teach me a lesson and I'm so out of control and stupid that I still haven't learnt it. Maybe I was mean? maybe I'm not a good kid I don't know. I just don't understand the reasoning behind that stuff being good for me, and I don't trust them to interfere w my life in a good way either. Am I just being spoilt?

94,1g1onbf,AITA for pointing out my friend has a reddit addiction,"I (19M) have been getting steadily more and more concerned about my roomate (19NB). Every day, they pace in the kitchen listening to reddit videos. Every time they eat...reddit. Every time they shower...reddit. When they go to sleep....reddit. I fear they are replacing all of us with reddit.... and finally, i couldn't take it anymore. While it was cute at first, with them screaming ""REDDIT TIME!!"" every time a new video is posted, they totally cannot function without those videos and I'm worried they won't be able to get anything done without them. 

Multiple times have I found them listening to reddit videos in social situations by having their earbuds in (with their hair/hat covering them). They have cannot talk to us if they have a reddit video playing, and they reached 1000 videos on a single reddit youtube channel within a month. Even while writing this post, they said they had to leave our discord call (we were gaming) to watch reddit videos.

I told them they had a reddit addiction and that it was impacting their friendships and mental wellbeing. They completely blew up at me over pointing that out, saying it wasn't an addiction and that they just really like reddit videos. They said that it was just an easy way to cope with focusing, but I insisted that they were ruining their focus as even halfway through this argument they started to drift away to another reddit video. I told them they are a bad friend and don't care about me and our other housemates, and they told me they were oppressing them for not listening to the fact they needed these videos for neurodivergent reasons (to which they did not elaborate). The argument ended with them calling me an ""annoying cunt"" and storming out the room. 

Now, things are pretty awkward between us, with them not talking to me whenever I see them in our house and playing their videos on full volume just to spite me, and I'm worried I went too far. My other housemates think I shouldn't have said anything, bar one who helped me draft this post.

Now I know this whole thing seems pretty outlandish and unserious, but I'm worried about my future living situation because of what's happened. However, I can't just let their addiction go as it's seriously impacting the friendships within the house.

My grandmother said we could take one cause she doesn't use it, and I told my mother as such. 

It took a while cause we don't have a vehicle to transport the stove but my dad worked it out and planned to have a family friend help bring it back here. 

He went this morning, and when he got there the stove was gone. My grandmother told him that my mom came to get it the week before(my grandmother is starting to lose her memory so she probably didn't realised what happened). My brother and I didn't find this out till after he got back home. I'm not 100% sure why she took it but  if I remember correctly, I think where she lives either didn't have a stove at all or a proper one.

Here's where I might be the AH. I was livid cause she knew how much we needed the stove and she was informed beforehand that we were going to get it. I unblocked(blocked for a different reason) her and cursed her out cause I thought it was a petty and selfish thing to do to her family. And I was already mad at her for previous events. 

I felt bad cause at the end of the day, she's still my mother, but I just felt like I had to say something cause my dad wasn't going to. 

So AITA?

Edit based on comments: 
-We're not in the US.

-My parents are recently separated. 

-I was more upset at her taking it after we asked than the stove itself(seemed purposeful), even though it would've been nice to have. 

-The stove my grandmother had has a convection oven that would've been great for my father's side business, which is a source of income we need at the moment. The stovetop on our stove still works but the seal, among other things, on the oven is broken so it doesn't bake properly.

I felt bad cause at the end of the day, she's still my mother, but I just felt like I had to say something cause my dad wasn't going to. 

So AITA?

Edit based on comments: 
-We're not in the US.

-My parents are recently separated. 

-I was more upset at her taking it after we asked than the stove itself(seemed purposeful), even though it would've been nice to have. 

-The stove my grandmother had has a convection oven that would've been great for my father's side business, which is a source of income we need at the moment. The stovetop on our stove still works but the seal, among other things, on the oven is broken so it doesn't bake properly. I think we can all appreciate the free things in life but obviously we're gonna have to buy one now. ",0.0,1.038061499595642,1,0
101,1g2cvz7,WIBTA If I (27 NB) told my sister (29F) that I don't won't to be a bridesmaid?,"So I do not want to be a bridesmaid for my older sister. For many reasons:

1) I have already been her bridesmaid before at her first wedding almost 3 years ago. It wasn't the best relationship nor was the best person in my eyes.

The longest relationship she had was 2 years with a dude named.... Brant. So she dated Brant then cheated on him with his friend called Ashton. They had this affairs for a few months before he found out and then broke it off. She kicked out Brant and moved Ashton in with a week. I told her maybe to use this time to keep Ashton at a distance, find herself and have him as a roommate or find a smaller apartment as her lease was almost up, and realize that she doesn't NEED a man to survive but have a partner because she loves them. Destination wedding gone wrong. Two days before the wedding I had over heard him and her yelling and she said verbatim ""I don't want to marry you"".

2) I was not asked. She expected it and just dropped it in a conversation. I have asked my younger brothers (20 and 21) if they don't mind being I'm MY wedding party. I had planned my sister and brother (27) to not be in it.

3) She has stolen my own wedding ideas. To be honest this is the most reason why I don't want to. One of the ideas was my and my gfs Wedding March. It's an opening to a game that my gf and I have bonded over (it was what started our friendship) and are planing to incorporate in our wedding along with another franchise that usually goes hand in hand (congratulations to those that figure it out 👏). I had planned it as mine when I was 16 and then told her to her when I was 18,  and then again, during her talks about her own wedding (long before the first). We would talk about it together and I guess she decided to use it. Without talking to me.

The theme of her wedding was elvin LOTR style but on the beach. I didn't know until it started to play (badly mind you) on her wedding. I had glanced at my gf at the time and say her livid. It was a special song to me and it's a VERY special song to her. Afterwards my gf pulled me aside and said she was going to do it better while I didn't want to use it at all as I felt it was disrespectful if I did. Then, I get a call from my sister telling me her idea for her wedding and also that I was in her wedding party.

My idea for my wedding was wedding with our esthetic then, at the reception, it could be a cosplay party. My gf and I have planned this for 3 years. In this talk she said she was going to have a cosplay reception. But renaissance style. When I asked where she got the idea she said I had said I was going to do it and thought it was a good idea.

I am livid. I don't want to be a bridesmaid. Especially after the last hellfire the last one was. So reddit would I be the AH?

103,1g2cruq,AITA for having issues with my FIL making himself at home?,"My (33M) wife’s (33F) father has been single (divorced) for about 20 years. Got divorced because he was a workaholic, working the midnight shift at a power plant. He never had any interest in dating or getting remarried, probably because he is extremely frugal. 

My wife and I bought a house in 2018, about a mile from him within the same town, and had a couple kids shortly thereafter (2019 and 2021). He retired in 2021. Since then, he has been coming to our house, most times unannounced, at least 4x a week. Some weeks it’s everyday.

Remember I said he was frugal? Well he keeps no food at his house. So he comes here and beelines for the fridge and pantry. He lays on the couch and puts his feet up, expecting my wife to serve him and cater to him, while scrolling on Instagram with volume on 100 and cackling out loud the whole time. Does nothing to help with the kids while he’s here at the same time we are. When he’s not lounging on IG he’s talking a million words a minute about things that are so boring or irrelevant, usually having told us the same things multiple times before. 

My wife feels bad saying anything to him since he is a reliable babysitter when we want to go out to dinner. He’s also our personal handyman even though he half-asses the work. However, despite her not saying anything to him directly, she agrees with my sentiment. 

I say things tongue-in-cheek or passive aggressively as a joke, but I know that if I ever try to have a real talk with him he’ll take it extremely personal. 

Am I the asshole for feeling this way? What should I do here?

I love Christmas and went all out and got him 13 small presents. I bought everything on clearance/BOGOs so it was only 150 bucks for everything (not including shipping). Some shirts, some funkos, a wallet, and a blanket. I bought some gifts for his mom and sister (his only family) as he was bringing me to Christmas at their house since my family moved out of state. 

On Christmas Eve when we got to their house I saw they only had about 2-3 presents out per person so I only brought a couple of my bf’s presents in from the car bc I didn’t want to have a giant pile just for my bf and make everyone sit there while he unwrapped a ton of smaller presents. 

Christmas rolled around, we opened presents, and then in private I surprised my bf with the rest of his presents before we went to bed. The next day he was really excited about one of them and showed his mom, she asked about it and he told her that I gave him more presents in private. She pulled me aside later and basically told me that she didn’t appreciate what I’d done and that I had gone too overboard. She only got my bf 2 presents BUT they were higher value presents whereas I bought my bf numerous smaller things. 

We’re spending Christmas at his family’s again. I reached out to his mom to ask her to let me know if she got anything off his wishlist so we didn’t double buy for my bf.

105,1g2cbfx,AITA for not giving my notes to a girl I used to consider a friend of mine?,"I (19,F) started university last year in the city that I live. I wanted socialize and have groups of friends I could hang out with but, I also wanted to be consistent with my studies and pass most of my classes.

In my second semester, I met a group of people that I hanged out a bit in uni, went out 2-3 times and talked a bit through a group chat that we made. But after a month or so, it seemed like I was the only one asking to go out and no one seemed to stay true to their word because they always seemed to cancel last minute after agreeing to our plans days before. They also seemed to stop coming to classes and only interacted with me when they needed notes or to ask questions about classes. I respected the fact that they maybe couldn't come because sometimes they were working or too bored, but it was just something that they seemed to do too often to be excused all the time. I tried my best to answer nicely but at the same time show that I am not interested in being their source of university news and information by saying quotes like ""the teacher will talk about this topic next class, come if you are interested"" or ""the website has news posted about X topic"". 
And that resulted into us not speaking after a while, the groupchat slowly becoming inactive and so on.

But now, months after not interacting at all, my third semester started and so did my lectures. I was attending a difficult class when one of the girls from the group came up and sat next to me being all nice and happy. I didn't really entertain any conversation because I was trying to take notes (mind you, it was a 3 hour lecture with no breaks) and she didn't seem to have brought any bag with notebooks inside and just sat at her phone until the very end of the lecture.
When the class finally ended, she just left without saying another word and I didn't get the chance to even try and see if I could maybe hang out with her or just talk.

Now, a week later, she texts me asking me for the notes I took.
I responded with a short message saying that we haven't interacted in months, that I don't really consider us friends anymore and that I think she is just using me because she didn't want to sit and actually take notes herself even though she came to class.

She answered saying i was the one who cut her and the group off and that I should consider her asking for my notes, a compliment. She later added that she believes that my negative reaction to her asking for notes is childish and I should reconsider how highly I view myself.

I told her that she is delusional and maybe come to class and take her own notes instead of slacking off and then blaming everyone but herself when she isn't passing her classes.

We’ve been not talking as much because I feel that we don’t have much to talk about anymore because I text her almost every day she replies with dry responses. After a hard day, me and a couple of friends were just chatting and Emma and her ex boyfriend come up. I was feeling frustrated after and I kind of just started spewing about them but I mentioned something about how Emma made me feel frustrated because she never let me have my own personal life. I understand that’s she wants to know why I’m busy but sometimes I don’t feel comfortable telling her, so I resort to lying. On many occasions we like to hang out with each other around two weeks ago I was going to hang out with another friend of mine and she wanted to too. However, the places we wanted to go contradicted and I didn’t really feel like going to far so I stuck to my plans with my other friend. So in order to reject Emma’s plans I her I was busy. I understand I was lying but I didn’t want her to feel like she was being replaced or not as important She responded with “busy doing what?” And I just sent her whatever came to my mind first which was that I was going to study. She proceeded to ask, “study for what?” So I said some test. After a little I sent her a couple of reels and she replied with “stop sending me reels and go study”. Based on this response I felt as if she was angry with me and was unhappy that we couldn’t go out. This has happened many other times before this and I just feel that she comes off passive aggressive just because I cannot call of go out.

Now back to the conversation with my friends. One of the people in the group decided to go and tell Emma how I felt because she felt as if Emma and I were drifting apart. Let’s call her Jane. So Jane goes and tells Emma that I think she gets mad at me when we can’t go out because she asks so many questions. So then Emma begins to ignore me. Another friend in the conversation told me about what Jane told Emma and I get confused. Emma is extremely angry at me because she feels that I view her as a clingy girlfriend but I can’t help but feel she is sometimes passive aggressive towards me when she wants me to call or go out. I understand why Jane did what she did and why she did it but I can’t help but think if I really am the cause of this falling out. I would love to continue to be friends with Emma but sometimes she does make me feel bad. I know talking behind someone’s back, especially a good friends, is bad. So AITA for lying to my best friend to try and make her feel not left out? (I’m pretty sure I am.

So, I’ve been friends with (let’s call her Emma) for 4 years and she’s someone I’d call my best friend. We’ve been not talking as much because I feel that we don’t have much to talk about anymore because I text her almost every day she replies with dry responses. After a hard day, me and a couple of friends were just chatting and Emma and her ex boyfriend come up. I was feeling frustrated after and I kind of just started spewing about them but I mentioned something about how Emma made me feel frustrated because she never let me have my own personal life. I understand that’s she wants to know why I’m busy but sometimes I don’t feel comfortable telling her, so I resort to lying. On many occasions we like to hang out with each other around two weeks ago I was going to hang out with another friend of mine and she wanted to too. However, the places we wanted to go contradicted and I didn’t really feel like going to far so I stuck to my plans with my other friend. So in order to reject Emma’s plans I her I was busy.

111,1g2btht,AITAH for just walking my small dog twice a day?,"For context:

My husband (28) and I (f28) have a Shih-Tzu mini Yorkie mix lady who is 10 years old since 2 days. 

We have quite a big apartment and have a 40 squaremeters garden (431 square feet) garden.

The situation:

Today I met a neighbor that recently got a golden retriever. We talked about our dogs and also about our walking habits because she said she never see us walking her. I told her, that I walk her in the morning and in the evening before bedtime, both around 30-60 minutes depending on the weather. The rest of the day we go in our garden. 

She got upset but I explained that we let her our every 1-2 hours for 10-15 minutes to pee, poo and play and we also share a few hours a day in the garden with her playing or sunbathing etc. (We clean up the garden right after her and there are no kids or other people on our grass except us) When the weather is good we leave the backdoor open for her to go in and out at her own will, she uses this often and spends many hours playing in the grass, animating us to play or just sunbathing. 

For example today I did plant a few flowers and tidied up the garden from weeds or leaves, in total my husband and I were outside around 4 hours. We had our backdoor open the whole time and the dog went in and out at her will. We played with her with sticks laying around or her toys she brought us.  

My neighbor still was upset and told me I am an AH for treating my dog so poorly and that this is animal cruelty what I do to her.

I don’t think that way because we have the garden and she gets lots of exercise in the time of a whole day. When we are not at home my father watches her because he is retired. But also she is already 10 years old and we are seeing that she needs more rest and is quieter than before. Her playtime reduced and she needs more breaks than 2 years ago.

My best friends said that yes she gets much exercise but we could also walk her more often and reduce the garden time. So I wanted an outside opinion. Am I the AH?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-12,"AITAH for just walking my small dog twice a day? For context:

112,1g2bjwt,AITA for staying up late to eat Crackers?,"My girlfriend (F22) of almost 3 years told me she's been loosing respect for me (M23) because of my irresponsibility. This was prompted with my action of staying up later than I should've on a work night, because I was going to make crackers & cheese before bed, but I got caught on a limited time event in a mobile game I play. I was only on my phone around 50 minutes.

In the middle of me playing, my girlfriend asked me why I couldn't play tomorrow, and telling me ""we need to go to bed soon can we please make our snacks now"". I felt really rushed and hurt, and I didn't want to explain to her that it was a limited time event, so I just decided to finish the whole event in that 50 mins. I finally got up to go make the snack, as it was only 30mins past when i was supposed to be asleep, and thats when she tells me, ""this is why I feel like im loosing respect for you, you're not very responsible."" 

I was really upset, and this might be where I'm the asshole, I told her she's annoying and that she doesn't get to dictate how I spend my time before work. 

She replied that she also has to get up early too and doesn't like missing sleep because of her chronic health condition thing, and that I never care about making her feel comfortable before work (she works so early in the morning that I usually just go back to sleep, there's not really any time to do anything so I don't understand?) and complaining that I don't do chores, or cook, even though I would if she just told me what she needed done. 

To end it, I said whatever, you're not gonna listen to me anyways, I'm done talking to you, goodnight. Then we just wordlessly went to sleep. It's been a day and a half and she hasn't spoken to me much, but says she's waiting for an apology and to talk about it. I don't think I went over the line, and I don't think there's really that much to talk about. I'm still so hurt that she would say she doesn't respect me. Reddit am I the asshole?


Edit: I do some chores without communicating with her, but she's very particular about how she likes the house to be and I'm just not as picky.

113,1g2bhht,AITA for telling my brother he's being dramatic over a Wii?,"This situation is so ridiculous that I had to post to Reddit because I'm getting called an AH.

I (24F) have two brothers, Will (25M) and Nick (17M). This is about my younger brother.

When we were growing up, Nick was very spoiled. His dad was pretty well off so if Nick wanted something, he got it and he frankly was mean about it so we had a strained relationship. 

Now we have had a good relationship but now I'm being called an AH because while one the phone with him (I moved out in 2018 and live 6+ hours away), he asked if I knew what happened to the Wii.

We got this Wii as a family Christmas gift is 2009. I told him I had it and he got angry.

For context back in 2009, when the system was bought for us, our mom gifted us two games.

As a kid I usually saved my money and didn't spend it unless I absolutely had to. Since it was around the holidays and Wii Sports got old fast, I decided I wanted to use my money to buy a game or two for the Wii. And over the next year or so, I probably bought between 3 and 5 games for it that I bought for myself to play.

There was an incident with me visiting family that he took a game I loved and ruined it while I was gone. That game took years to get fixed as my mom had other priorities but since then, I never let him touch anything of mine, including the games.

Instead of buying his own games (we all earned money in some way) or asking for games for Christmas, he only wanted to play mine and I refused every time. 

Eventually he forgot about it because his dad had eventually bought him newer consoles. And the Wii was dubbed as mine since W never really cared for it and Nick had new systems and had abandoned the Wii.

This was the point in time that my mom had let me bring the Wii into my room because it was collecting dust in our living room and I was the only one playing it. We moved multiple times before I had turned 18 and was able to leave the house and nobody ever mentioned the Wii.

The present:

Nick is angry that I have the Wii and said I need to mail it back to him because it was bought for Family use, not individual siblings. I told him I wasn't paying the postage and that if he looked online, the Wii was cheap to buy and he has a job that he could pay for a used one. Nick told me that I stole it from the house when I moved to college in 2018 and that I didn't have permission. I told him that our mother gave me permission and that he was being dramatic.

I told him regardless, I was not sending it back to him. It's been in my possession for years and he hasn't even thought about it for longer than that. I asked him what game it was and guess what he said?

The game that he destroyed! That's the game he bought! 

I told him absolutely not, at this point in petty mode because the nostalgia he has for that game, made me unable to play it for years so I'm even more sure about not sending it back now.

I'm fully aware I'm now being petty but am I being an AH?

I told him I expected that he would be happy cause finally I'm making new friends here, and I try to explain to him that the only thing that change was the time, that we could go to the festival and that I thought he wouldn't mind to go at night!",1.0,1.01235830783844,1,1
117,1g2aq7k,AITA for skinny dipping?,"My husband and I usually go hiking with his friends on weekends when the weather is nice. Last weekend we went hiking on a new trail and came across a small lake after a few hours of hiking. This trail was a loop so we were maybe a mile or two from our car. One of his friends suggests we take a break and hop in the water. Everyone agrees.

The two friends shed their shirt and shorts and jump in. As I'm getting ready to take my shirt off my husband stops me and says I gotta just sit on the side because it would be inappropriate for me to go in. I tell him that is ridiculous. He says he doesn't want his friends seeing me nude.

I tell him to stop being ridiculous and quickly strip down and hop in. He comes in shortly after but hardly says anything and I can tell he's upset. We swim for maybe 30 min. Dry off get dressed and go eat. And now he's being all ""I can't believe you did that"" and ""You gave my friends a show"". It's been a few days now and he's wanting me to apologize.

It's somewhat of a dorm, so there's people moving in and out every few months. I've been here for  two years now, and I've seen my fair share of mess. In the beginning, I would be very civil when addressing messes in either the bathrooms or the kitchen. When I'd ask someone to clean up, the person who made the mess would come clean about 25% of the time. This means I was cleaning up after people a LOT. I let them get away with it for the sake of peace.

Recently there was an incident where someone has been leaving dishes and old food for days on end in the sink. One of my housemates would text saying ""guys, I cleaned this up last time. Please clean up after yourselves"". Two days pass and the dishes are still there. At this point Im getting frustrated because polite requests are falling on deaf ears, and i write ""don't be fking disgusting"" ""food in the sink??? Not only are you lazy but you're also stupid"". 

I also threaten to knock on doors and start throwing dishes in rooms if everyone denies accountability. Although I never actually would have done this, and I didnt, I feel this was the first point where I could have been the AH.

This caught people's attention and people start saying ""it wasn't me"". 

All except one girl.

A few hours pass and I need to use the kitchen, so I say ""I'm gonna go ahead and wash these now, but if this happens one more time I swear I'm gonna make it your problem you nasty fk"" and I @ the girl that has been quiet.

She also tells me that yelling and swearing isn't a solution to this problem.

This is where I have mixed feelings about if I'm the AH or not. I ended up apologizing to her for calling her out, because it's true that I was not 100% sure. We don't have cameras in the kitchen. So for that I agree that I wasn't in the right.

119,1g2a02i,AITA for telling my sister to just suck it up and wear the bridesmaid dress our cousin chose?,"My cousin Christie (27F) got engaged a few months ago and asked my sister Jessica (20F) and I (25F) to be bridesmaids in her wedding. She recently sent the bridesmaid dress she picked for us in the bridal party group chat, and everyone immediately gushed about how much we loved it, and Christie was clearly very happy and excited about the dress. It’s an orange satin dress with a pink floral pattern. It’s definitely a very bright and bold choice, but I personally think it’s really pretty, and fits her colorful tropical wedding theme really nicely.

However, my sister Jessica HATES everything about dress. She thinks the color is ugly, the pattern is tacky, and that satin is impractical for a beach wedding. She does not want to be seen wearing it or have pictures of her in posted on social media. She has been begging me to help her talk to Christie about it and tell her to pick a different dress, or let us choose our own dresses. She also wants to reach out to the other bridesmaids (who are mostly Christie’s friends who we barely know yet) and ask them their opinion, because she is certain no one else likes the dress.

I’ve told Jessica that she just needs to suck it up, because part of being a bridesmaid is realizing the day is not about you or your preferences. We are there to support the bride and make the day special for her. Christie clearly has a certain vision for her dream wedding, and I feel like wearing the dress she wants for one day is not a huge ask. 

Jessica does not see it that way, and believes she should not be made to wear a something she is not comfortable in. It would be different if her discomfort came from the dress being too revealing, or if she wasn’t comfortable wearing dresses in general. But her argument basically boils down to the dress being ugly in her opinion and not her style. I don’t know how we would confront Christie with this without insulting her taste and potentially hurting her feelings.


The wedding is still 8 months away, so if I’m the asshole here and should try to change Christie’s mind on behalf of my sister, now is the time to do it before everyone has bought the dresses and gotten alterations. But I would rather just avoid the drama.

EDIT: since a couple people asked to see the dress I will try to add the link to it.

120,1g29ykt,AITAH for dropping the girl my friend likes at home?,"For context, I live in an extremely dangerous city, in a country world renowned for GBV (gender based violence).  I literally witnessed someone getting mugged earlier today in broad daylight. 

I work part time with a bunch of my friends. Recently my closest friend has been interested in one of the girls we work with. 

Tonight after the shift, we were both chilling in our cars outside work.

I saw this girl leaving work, usually she gets picked up, but this time she just kept walking further and further down the main road. I saw this, ran up to my friends car and said ""yo she's walking home did you know about that"" not thinking of how this might have looked, I hopped into my car and sped off after her because she was slowly walking out of sight.

I finally caught up to her, and asked her where she's going and why she's walking home instead of asking someone for a lift. I offered to drop her off (5 min drive from where we work) and she said yes and I dropped her off.

When I got back to the branch, my friend was gone. Wer were supposed to meet up somewhere after work. I texted him and he was upset with me, saying ""what I did was weird"" and ""disrespectful towards him"". I admit, I sped off without waiting for him to hop in, or without asking him to drive after her. But honestly, I was just concerned that a woman her age should not be walking home in a dangerous area at this time of night. I didnt do it to gain favour from her, or to ""out-do"" him. And I'd be extremely grateful of one of my friends would help my girlfriend out in the same way, I'd never want her walking anywhere in this city at night.

Am I the asshole for dropping her off?

122,1g29haq,AITAH for having having sympathy for my grandfather?,"Posting this on a burner account because I don't want to use my main.

For context: A few weeks ago, my grandfather had a serious fall. He was on the floor for a while before being taken to the hospital, and now he's at a rehab facility for mobility issues. His experience there hasn’t been great—he’s being neglected by the night staff, some of whom are rude, and he’s barely eating. Recently, one of my aunts made him a sandwich, but he refused to eat it, and he's mostly been starving himself. Additionally, he’s showing early signs of dementia, according to his doctors.

The issue: My grandfather was not a good person to his family. back then, he did, and my mom constantly reminds me of how terrible he was as a parent. I even blame him partly for the passing of my grandmother.

One of my aunts (the one who's moving out) has been treated almost exactly like my grandmother was. My grandfather expects her to take care of everything for him, to ""baby"" him, and put his needs above her own. It’s been emotionally exhausting for her, to the point where she’s broken down in tears over the pressure. She’s now moving out of their childhood home and likely cutting off all contact with him, which I completely understand.

However, my other aunt and my mom are furious at her for leaving, saying she should be helping him, even though my mom openly despises him. I don’t understand why my mom feels sympathy for him despite everything he did, and we had a small argument over it. She seems to expect me to feel the same sympathy just because he’s my grandfather, but I personally feel he’s getting what he deserves.

Now, I’m feeling conflicted. Part of me wonders if I should feel some sympathy for him since he’s always been nice to me, but I also can’t ignore the fact that he was a horrible person to the rest of my family.

So, AITAH for not feeling sympathy for my grandfather?

TLDR: My grandfather is now struggling in a rehab facility. While he was awful to my mom, aunts, and grandmother, he’s always been kind to me.

123,1g28z19,WIBTA if I did not tip one of the doormen?,"I (42F) am probably neurodivergent. Through childhood, teens and 20s people would often tell me I was rude or inconsiderate. I never wanted to make people feel bad, so I learned to compensate for the fact that I don't know certain things I am supposed to know by being overly polite and accommodating. This has worked pretty well and most people think I am a little weird, but overall nice. The downside of being so polite is sometimes people, mostly men, think I am a push over and try to take advantage of me. I do not like this and it upsets me.

My husband and I rent a co-op from my MIL. Our co-op is in a middle class neighborhood and is not very flashy. The people who live there with us are mostly retirees on pensions and a few families. Some people of the older generations are probably well off, no one is rich.

One of the doormen in our building started acting really nice to me and going out of his way to help me. I was suspicious at first, but figured that maybe he was embarrassed by how he treated me when we first moved into the building and was overcompensating. He wasn't mean or rude, but for some reason he thought I was someone's cleaning lady. The first three months, he would ask me who I was working for. If I entered the building late, he would tell me I cannot clean at night. I would explain that I lived there and he'd let me go. It didn't really bother me, but none of the other doormen did this. The doorman finally realized I lived there when he saw me leaving with my husband.

Few days ago the doorman helps me with my grocery cart to the elevator. Then he asks me, ""Can I ask you for a favor?"" I thought maybe I did something rude without knowing it and he wanted to tell me not to do whatever rude thing I have been doing; I say, ""sure."" He smiles and asks me if he can borrow $100. I start laughing (which I realize is very rude) because I find the request absurd. I told him that I do not have that kind of money and that I am on foodstamps. He says sorry and goes back to the desk. In retrospect, I probably could have handled that interaction better.

Now I avoid going through the lobby when this doorman is working, I use the basement exit instead. I told my husband that I would not be able to get any packages when this doorman is working and my husband said that it was all right, he would take care of it.

The holidays are coming up and my husband and I usually save up and give each of the doormen $75. My question is WIBTA if I didn't tip this doorman? Even though I do not have any contact with him anymore, my husband still does and the doorman does things like receive our packages and sort them in the mailroom. I guess my issue is that I still feel like he was trying to take advantage of me, which makes me angry. But I don't have proof outside my ""gut"" that says he behaved in a similar pattern to people who have tried to scam me in the past.

If I entered the building late, he would tell me I cannot clean at night. I would explain that I lived there and he'd let me go. It didn't really bother me, but none of the other doormen did this. The doorman finally realized I lived there when he saw me leaving with my husband.

Few days ago the doorman helps me with my grocery cart to the elevator. Then he asks me, ""Can I ask you for a favor?"" I thought maybe I did something rude without knowing it and he wanted to tell me not to do whatever rude thing I have been doing; I say, ""sure."" He smiles and asks me if he can borrow $100. I start laughing (which I realize is very rude) because I find the request absurd. I told him that I do not have that kind of money and that I am on foodstamps. He says sorry and goes back to the desk. In retrospect, I probably could have handled that interaction better.

Now I avoid going through the lobby when this doorman is working, I use the basement exit instead. I told my husband that I would not be able to get any packages when this doorman is working and my husband said that it was all right, he would take care of it.

The holidays are coming up and my husband and I usually save up and give each of the doormen $75. My question is WIBTA if I didn't tip this doorman? Even though I do not have any contact with him anymore, my husband still does and the doorman does things like receive our packages and sort them in the mailroom. I guess my issue is that I still feel like he was trying to take advantage of me, which makes me angry. But I don't have proof outside my ""gut"" that says he behaved in a similar pattern to people who have tried to scam me in the past. But these are just feelings and without evidence to back them up.",0.0,0.9492517113685608,1,0
124,1g28sn2,WIBTAH if I told a special needs kid to stay away from me,"So there's this very clearly special needs boy at my school. He's accompanied by a women who helps him throughout school. He's a nice guy normally I was friends with him for quite a bit but the problems arose when he became more romantically interested in me.

 I am aromantic and even if I wasn't he wouldn't be my type, mostly because I feel the need to censor what I say around him (like no cursing or sex jokes) mostly because he just seems way too innocent. At first it was pretty chill, he'd just drop some hints here and there. I didn't want to hurt him so I just pretended I was oblivious. 

Then he got my number and he'd call me every Day after school and in every call he'd ask multiple times about kissing me and the way he was stating these questions made it seem like he was actually intending to just suddenly kiss me without asking some day. I told him no every time but the questions just kept coming up. I was extremely uncomfortable with it, but I still didn't want to hurt him since I figured he probably doesn't have bad intentions and he's really special needs so he might now fully understand. So I just decided to avoid him instead I tried to not make it extremely obvious I'm avoiding him because that would probably hurt. 

I'm not entirely sure if he's still interested in me but I'm definitely still scared that he'll do something. Recently I was at a dance and I don't like crowds so I was off wall flowering and he approached me and I got genuinely terrified. I was praying that a slow dance song didn't start playing until after I got away from him. I ended up leaving as soon as he looked away, then waited for my friend to get out of the bathroom because I was too scared to go back on the dance floor alone. 

Before the dance I probably would've said I still want to be his friend I just don't want him to see me like that but to be completely honest he's just made me way too uncomfortable in too many situations I honestly don't want to be his friend. I am tempted to tell him to stay away from me and if he sees me just don't approach me, but I mean he's still special needs and Im worried if I did tell him to stay away it'd be way too harsh especially considering the only way he's ever actually touched me was holding my hand or hugging me.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-12,"WIBTAH if I told a special needs kid to stay away from me So there's this very clearly special needs boy at my school.

126,1g28n8i,WIBTA if I let my partner default on a car loan,"My (25f) fiancée/partner (38m) recently had to take out a car loan because his old beater finally had too many problems to be worth fixing. He talked with a dealership and they ran his credit before making it clear that’s what they were doing, he felt pressured, and he ended up buying a much more expensive car than we had talked about. It is safer, newer (so hopefully will have less issues to fix), and is big enough to fit us and our pets comfortably. 

Well, the first payment was due a week ago. He has a grace period, so the money has to be in by Monday at the absolute latest. He does side jobs, gig work on apps. He had half the payment two days ago, and we made a plan to put in the payment on Friday, so it’ll post Monday and we’ll have the weekend to make up the difference. And I said, worst case scenario we can borrow some money from my mom to make it happen, thinking it would be less than half the payment. 

Then, the next day (yesterday) he turns around and spends the money he had for the payment on an auction (in hopes to make profit) but it was a flop. So now we have not even 1/5 of the money for the payment. I told him I’m embarrassed to be with him. He’s spent the day sulking and complaining about how he messes everything up. I tried lying with him for a while, but it didn’t do anything. He has all these excuses: the season, lack of support from friends, trying to quit smoking, stress of taking care of the house, stress of family, etc. 

I’m tired of helping him out of his self-sabotage, and I’m so embarrassed to ask my mom for the amount of money we need. I can’t lie to her about why we don’t have the money; I’m an awful liar. I already offered to ask though. I know she’ll give it to me if I ask, but I feel terrible asking this much (even though I can 100% pay her back on payday, just put off my other bills). And it’s not like I can even assure her he’s spending the weekend working to get some of it, because he’s not. It’ll wreck his credit if the payment bounces and he defaults on it though.

My grandma is in no way a frail old lady, she does most of the cleaning, cooking, etc. around the house, and she says she has no problem with it, she says it “gives her something to do during the day”.

My grandma sat besides me for a bit at the table, making conversation until she began to tell me everything i had to do or was doing wrong, “you have to do laundry”, “you have to change your pillowcases”, “stop taking such big bites”, “take a shower before you go to bed”, “pack your bag so you can go to your moms house tomorrow”, “get your elbows off the table”, etc.

At some point i began to get agitated, as i usually do when she does this (it wasn’t the first time she’s done this, but the first time i’ve responded in this way). Mind you, i have a short temper and i’m very aware of that, so i typically try to avoid these situations. 

As i had said before, i got agitated, and i said something along the lines of, “Okay, i get it, i have to do all this stuff soon and i’m going to, so can you please stop talking for like 10 minutes?” and i’d said it at a pretty fast speed, so it might have sounded a bit aggressive. 

She reacted with standing up from the table, saying “i’m sorry for bothering,” and a few other things i can’t remember off the top of my head.

I raised my voice, saying “dude” and slamming my hands down on the table, and she shouted something at me aswell, though it was incoherent. I stood up aswell and put my food into tupperware, as she stormed off into her room upstairs.

129,1g25ddd,AITA for delaying our gym trip and upsetting my super time-conscious boyfriend?,"This might seem boring compared to other stories here, but I'd appreciate some perspective. My boyfriend (35) and I (34) have been fighting, and I can't figure out why it became such a big deal.


Context
My boyfriend is very intense about time management and hates wasting time. He’s productive and punctual, seeing it as a sign of respect for others. That said, he does relax, and isn't like this 100% of the time. I respect his need for timeliness, try hard not to delay him, and keep it in mind when we’re together—though I'm not perfect.
Another important thing to add is that this was a work day for both of us. We work from home and can mostly manage our own time, no need to do a typical 9 to 5.


What happened
So yesterday around lunch time he says to me ‘Hey, I am going to the gym’.

I respond by saying ‘ah, I was also thinking of going now-ish, maybe we can go together?’ (we often go to the gym together) and he agrees. I tell him I am finishing work in 15 minutes and will come downstairs.
I then come downstairs and suggest we have lunch before we go, because the gym is usually very busy at around midday, if we had lunch, this would mean we would be going a little later and the gym would be emptier. Also, we needed to have lunch anyway, either before or after the gym. He agreed to have lunch first.

After lunch, I went to the sofa to relax as I was feeling a bit off, and also to try to digest a bit before going to the gym. He sat next to me and was watching football on his phone. 

Then I suggested we get up and go to the cafe which is right next to the gym, we always have coffee after lunch so I thought this would be a good idea. It would get us moving towards the gym and we would get our after-lunch coffee.

After I said that, I was feeling low energy and possibly sick, this is why I wanted to rest on the sofa and also try to get coffee before going. I then expressed to him ‘actually I maybe shouldn’t go to the gym today, maybe I could go tomorrow instead I feel exhausted’.

Then he got extremely annoyed, he started saying that I was disrespecting his time and that I was dragging him along. He got very pissed off in a way that, to me, seemed to come out of nowhere.
I get that I was slow, maybe annoying and too laid-back. But I only made suggestions he kept agreeing to. I never forced anything, and he didn’t say he was in a hurry until he got mad. He let me take the lead but clearly wanted things his way (which would have been fine), and didn’t say anything until his frustration boiled over.

As I said, sometimes he is chill, sometimes he is intense about time. How was I supposed to know this was not a chill moment? How could I be 'dragging him along' and 'disrespecting his time' when I literally only made suggestions.
