0,1g2ghz0,AITA for falling out with a friend after not being picked to go on a trans girls weekend she was hosting?,"So I (39, Trans woman) have most of my community of trans friends online (mostly through Instagram), and in that time, there have been a handful of people who I‚Äôve come to consider friends. 

One of those friends holds a bi-annual ‚Äúgirls weekend‚Äù where people who present female at least some of the time come from across the country for a weekend of fellowship, shopping, going out, and girling out. Even though I‚Äôve transitioned, I still want community, and several people I consider friends go. So, when she announced sign-ups for the next event, I reached out to express interest, and tell her that once I got the okay from my partner, I was going to buy a plane ticket and sign up. A few days later, I asked about logistics, and she gave me information about lodging and how the weekend works. On the last day of signups, I bought a plane ticket and officially signed up. 

The next week, she made an announcement that she (along with a board) selected who got to go, and those selected would be notified that morning. (Wait‚Ä¶ there was a cutoff?)

By afternoon, it was obvious I didn‚Äôt get picked. It wasn‚Äôt a message from her that made me me aware‚Ä¶ it was silence‚Ä¶ nothing. I heard nothing, though I did see a few IG posts from friends who did get picked. 

A couple weeks later and admittedly after I had a few drinks, I decided to reach out to confess that I felt really hurt. One thing that I admit to being an asshole about was that I was much more bitchy than I should have been, though I don‚Äôt regret reaching out.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not hurt that I wasn‚Äôt selected‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hurt that, in the times I‚Äôd reached out to her, including mentioning that I was looking at flights, not once did she bother to tell me that not everyone who signs up gets to go, and once the guest list was finalized, I was practically ghosted by her. 

The next day, she sent a series of ‚Äúincognito messages‚Äù telling me that she had been surprised by me buying a flight, that she and the board agreed to not pick me because they didn‚Äôt want to set a precedent that ‚Äúa way to force yourself in would be to buy a plane ticket,‚Äù became really defensive in her tone, and then told me to block her if I didn‚Äôt like it. I sent a few messages clarifying why I was hurt, asking her to clarify in the future that signing up doesn‚Äôt guarantee you get to come, and then I backed away. 

I feel terrible, humiliated, and, honestly, rejected. After a couple of days, I reached out to a mutual friend to better understand what had happened, but was instantly greeted with a very cold response, and then a lecture about how I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnot accepted,‚Äù but instead ‚Äúnot selected.‚Äù While I see what she was trying to say, lecturing me on the semantics of accepted vs selected felt like gaslighting when, honestly, I felt rejected. 

So‚Ä¶ was I the asshole in all of this? Had she reached out to me to explain that, I would have totally understood and supported the decision. Instead, I was ghosted and I feel like such an idiot.

1,1g309jp,AITA for unknowingly upsetting several folks at a convention at the end of August?,"**DISCLAIMER: I(23m) have autism, possibly ADHD, but I've yet to get a proper diagnosis for the latter. Boundaries, reading the air, and emotional and speech regulation (how I feel and what comes out of my mouth) are not my strong points. Though I try to learn from my mistakes, I still get people who view me as a jerk even though some of my behavior aligns with someone who has these conditions. So I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a real jerk, or if I need to manage an undiagnosed condition better.**



Anyway, in the days before PopCult, I was exhibiting high anxiety. There are a bunch of people that I usually see at conventions who are normally free, but most of them were on staff at this particular convention, and I was worried about not getting the chance to say hi to them. I made it clear on their streams despite knowing there was that chance. I knew they would be busy that weekend, but I didn‚Äôt realize how busy they were.



Not much happened on Friday aside from me complaining about not being able to join everyone for dinner, but I was understanding citing how that was a female/non-binary-only thing, so I let it slide.



The only notable incidents on Saturday were 1. me leaving the manga library at the wrong time to find that the people I wanted to talk to were busy with other people, and another member of staff having the same idea by coincidence and getting concerned when she saw me, and 2. trying to join in conversation with my co-mate and her friend without realizing how busy they were providing feedback since they were masquerade judges.



Sunday was the worst. A lot happened. 1. I impulsively jumped in to fix a party member‚Äôs badge, but I didn‚Äôt know they didn‚Äôt like being touched. 2. I was with my con-mate and some of her friends, including the staff member from yesterday. I showed off a Bionicle sticker I got at Artist Alley to her, but I was unexpectedly met with an unnerved reaction. 3. I mistakenly assumed that I would get a hug from someone my con-mate knew, but I failed to realize that I hadn‚Äôt even shaken her hand prior. 4. I suffered a meltdown when everyone was going to film Tiktoks and I couldn‚Äôt come along because I did not have the app. I tried to mask it and respect them, but my anxiety and frustration over not feeling included got to a point where I snapped and I had to be pulled away for a chat. Finally, I forgot that I wasn‚Äôt supposed to talk to said staff member‚Äôs fiancee when I told him I was heading home.



After the con was over, my con-mate‚Äôs friend blocked me. In addition, I swear I barely did any trauma dumping on Twitch when I said I was still recovering mentally and emotionally from the convention. I didn‚Äôt go into specifics for fear of going too far, and the rule was unspoken on their streams, but it was still enough for the staff member and some of her friends to cut me off! She even accused me of thinking I was her friend even though I knew she was not. No one let me explain, and I‚Äôve been feeling awful ever since.

4,1g2wg81,AITA for not offering my home to my twin ,"
Hi everyone! I‚Äôm not sure how many people this will reach so I‚Äôm not expecting much of a response. My twin and I‚Äôs birthday is coming up pretty soon and we‚Äôre turning 30. She‚Äôs going through kind of a rough time-her and her ex boyfriend broke up recently after having moved to another state together a few months ago and (obviously) getting an apartment/signing a lease together. Our mom just told me that my twin will be coming here to our home state and mentioned the possibility of my twin staying with me. I didn‚Äôt even know she was going to be coming down here for our birthday until a couple days ago and it‚Äôs mainly because of everything that is going on with her and her ex. There‚Äôs more to the story of her and her ex breaking up but I won‚Äôt go into it because that‚Äôs her story. Essentially before they broke up, she was kind of nasty to me when I told her something she didn‚Äôt want to hear at the time. Now, for our birthday, my plan was to camp alone for a couple of days, one of those being the actual day of our birthday. Am I an asshole for not really wanting her to stay with me in my apartment and not want to move around my original plan to accommodate her? This will be the first time in the year and some change I would have a guest in my studio apartment. Not only that, I didn‚Äôt really want to do anything big with anyone (except for my mom) for my birthday this year even though I‚Äôm turning 30. I know she‚Äôs going through a tough time with her breakup and if my mom had just told me she was coming back home for our birthday rather than her suggesting my sister stay with me, I would be there for her. But suggesting she stay with me wasn‚Äôt my idea in the first place. I just wonder if I‚Äôm being selfish/an asshole or if what I‚Äôm feeling is valid

We have something planned with my mom, sis, stepdad, stepsister and my stepsisters boyfriend on another day other than my actual birthday too so it‚Äôs not like we aren‚Äôt doing anything!

Cee and I used to be really close‚Äîshe‚Äôd confide in me about everything, especially her frustrations with our friends. But the way she talked about people wasn‚Äôt exactly kind.

It was confusing.

At some point, I started sharing with her friends what Cee had been saying about them behind their backs. It wasn‚Äôt long before things took a turn. We started hanging out without her, especially after she flipped out on me for going out with some friends without her. Apparently, since she introduced me to them, she thinks I shouldn‚Äôt hang out without her permission.

That situation spiraled, and now our friendship is strained. We don‚Äôt talk or hang out as much. To make things even more awkward, I found out her family doesn‚Äôt like me‚Äîor anyone from her friend group, really. None of us feel comfortable around her place anymore.

Recently, some of us ditched our last class to chill by the pool at a friend‚Äôs house. Cee, who has our location, saw we were hanging out and went off on another friend about how I went without her. And just yesterday, we went to a birthday party that Cee wasn‚Äôt invited to. The host didn‚Äôt even want her to know about it.

6,1g2vrp2,AITA for not inviting my stepmother wedding dress shopping?,"I went shopping for my wedding dress last weekend and picked a dress. I brought my two best friends and my two grandma's. My stepmother saw our photo on the bridal store's page and she was upset I didn't ask her to come. Two of her son's are married and their wives didn't invite her either and her third son is gay so I was her only chance to experience this because she has no daughters. She told me she wanted to come and wanted to know why I wouldn't invite her. She claimed she became my mom when I was 10 (which is when she married my dad) and she had no other girls so having me leave her out was extra hurtful. She vented about her DILs not including her in that process either and how one went solo even though she was free and close by to go with her.

For reference, I do not consider her my mom and I never considered her in a parental light. She's married to my dad and makes him happy so I appreciate that but I never liked how she seemed to obsess about me being a girl and having a mother/daughter relationship. My own mom died so it made me more protective of who claims that title for me. But even still I do not feel like she would have made any effort to be a mom to me if I were a stepson vs a stepdaughter.

I wasn't going to include her in anything wedding related. She'll be invited as my dad's wife. She'll be in photos because they're married. She'll be seated with him for the same reason. But she's not mother of the bride or anything. And I don't have a relationship with her where I would ask her to help with wedding related stuff. I'm no longer that close to my dad either so I don't see them often anyway. But she has been making her point about being left out and asking me why I excluded her. It's very clear she's unhappy.

For reference, I do not consider her my mom and I never considered her in a parental light. She's married to my dad and makes him happy so I appreciate that but I never liked how she seemed to obsess about me being a girl and having a mother/daughter relationship. My own mom died so it made me more protective of who claims that title for me. But even still I do not feel like she would have made any effort to be a mom to me if I were a stepson vs a stepdaughter.

I wasn't going to include her in anything wedding related. She'll be invited as my dad's wife. She'll be in photos because they're married. She'll be seated with him for the same reason. But she's not mother of the bride or anything. And I don't have a relationship with her where I would ask her to help with wedding related stuff. I'm no longer that close to my dad either so I don't see them often anyway. But she has been making her point about being left out and asking me why I excluded her. It's very clear she's unhappy.

This July when I call to confirm his coming to help me move he tells me he now can't because they have decided to get married in Oct of this year.He has to save money.Not going to lie.I was upset w/the extra physical&financial burden caused by his backing out.It also hurt my feelings but I kept my mouth shut because I am not entitled to his help.

In Sept I reached out to him to confirm wedding is still on for end of October.

8,1g2vhs0,AITA for not helping plan our post-uni trip?,"
For context, I‚Äôm planning a post-uni graduation trip for 6 of us total, which has been in the works for months. With exams around the corner, this trip is supposed to be a stress-free celebration of our hard work. I‚Äôm a very Type A planner, and I‚Äôm okay that my friends aren‚Äôt as organized, but I feel like the planning burden is mostly on me.

From the start, it‚Äôs been tough to get responses. I‚Äôll ask for input and sometimes hear nothing back. I know they‚Äôre busy, but as friends, I feel I deserve at least some acknowledgment or direction. The lack of response makes it hard to book things, especially when limited spots or discounts are available.

One specific instance was a play we wanted to watch. I‚Äôd been asking for weeks for everyone to book their tickets, but when they finally checked, the cheaper seats were sold out. They then expected me to somehow find cheaper tickets, as if I could work a miracle. It felt like they relied on me to save the day instead of handling it themselves, knowing I‚Äôll pick up the pieces if things fall apart.

On top of that, they like to throw in tons of opinions after I‚Äôve already spent hours researching the best options, despite not doing any research themselves. They‚Äôll make suggestions or complaints based purely on what they ‚Äúthink‚Äù without knowing the logistics, budget, or options I‚Äôve already ruled out. When we get on group calls to discuss plans, I often feel like I‚Äôm talking to myself, planning everything alone. And when they change the itinerary without notifying anyone, it proves they‚Äôre capable of organizing when they want to, but for some reason, they think trip planning is mainly my responsibility.

So, AITA for feeling frustrated that they aren‚Äôt helping more? Should I just suck it up because I took on the role of planner, or is it fair to expect a little more participation from them?

My (18M) brother has been eating tons of eggs and greasy meats lately.

He claims it's because he can't throw away the hot grease and has to let it cool. I said he can just use napkins to soak it up but cleaning his own dishes has always been a contentious issue. He also left a whole pack of soggy ramen in the pot for over a day despite me telling him to throw it out.

I want to be able to cook myself dinner with my own kitchenware without having to always clean up after him. Especially because washing those kinds of dishes gives me the ick.

11,1g2v7vv,AITA for refusing to switch my daughter to another school.,"I have a daughter (15F). She was always happy with her school and has good friends.

Some years ago when my son was her age, I switched him to an elite private school. Not because I thought the education was better but they follow an international curriculum based on the UK system and this is helpful for applying to international universities who recognize the system. My son will be studying engineering abroad.

At the time when my son changed schools my daughter said she was happy not to switch schools and said it would be hard to make new friends etc.

However now since he started attending she has gotten jealous and started reading his textbooks especially the science ones and going through things like the yearbook.

She is now upset with me because I refused to switch her to the school even though she herself at the time said she was happy where she was.

While I can afford it, the education isn't really better and I only sent my son there so that foreign universities recognize the credential better.

Furthermore the school environment would be quite different. She goes to a girls only school and this is co-ed and most of the girls at the school are foreigners with different values and usually the kids of diplomats and embassy workers and the boys are either the kids of diplomats or the ultra rich locals and I am concerned this could cause her to either not fit in or lose her morals.

13,1g2v23f,AITA ‚Äî Upset Streamer Reaction,"I‚Äôm a small Twitch streamer, mainly for fun and as a side hustle while being a stay-at-home mom with a chronic illness. I landed a big sponsorship to stream and get downloads for a game, which was a huge deal for me, especially since my family and friends usually dismiss my streaming.

During my sponsored stream, my dad called. I sent an auto-reply asking if it was urgent or another prank, since he‚Äôs interrupted my streams before like this. He called again after the message, and I knew it was a joke, so I declined. He texted, ‚ÄúCome on. I can be part of your show. The annoying interrupting dad. Thought about that?‚Äù I ignored him and kept talking about the game. 

Then 15 minutes later, my mom calls me and I sent similar message about streaming and is it urgent. She responds ‚ÄúHe wants to know why you won‚Äôt talk to him? Did he do something‚Äù. Right away I realize he went through his ex-wife to contact me. My response was ‚ÄúI‚Äôm streaming and he knows I‚Äôm streaming. He is using you to get to me. He knows it will interfere with my job.‚Äù I call my stream my job since it is my only source of income.

I ask husband to call my dad to remind him how important this stream is to me. At this point it has been maybe 30-40 minutes live with my 4 regular viewers trying to communicate with me and my best friend(mod) talking to hold over my silence. So I finally am getting back to the game and my 5 year old son who has autism walks up and loudly asked/screams, why are you ignoring grandpa when he wants you to talk to him. I hear over the speaker phone in the doorway of my husband trying to grab my son, my dad and sister laughing. My husband grabs my son and leaves, but the damage is done and I‚Äôm shot. I‚Äôm crying ugly and end my stream abruptly and raid out to my friend/mod I was supposed to play the game with later in stream.

When my husband called, they asked if our son was awake to say hi, but it was just a way to get to me. I know it wasn‚Äôt his fault, and he didn‚Äôt get in trouble, but it was so nasty of my family to use him like that. He‚Äôs too young to understand and just saw me crying, thinking I was mad at him for interrupting my stream. On top of that, I felt defeated from a failed sponsorship stream due to a prank.

So here is why I‚Äôm asking if I‚Äôm the asshole, because of my response to him. Was I rude for using harsh language in my texts?

Myself- You really pissed me off. I‚Äôm very livid. I get this means shit to you. I get that you see my source of income a joke. Thanks. Next time you are in a work call I‚Äôll have everyone interrupt you.

Dad- Have a good night

Myself- This is my sponsorship. You are being a dick to me at my job. It isn‚Äôt funny and you hurt me

My boyfriend is quite calm naturally. Not much phases him. Though when he expresses frustration like a sigh or is mad at something I don't jump to find solutions for him or tell him to calm down. I ask what's wrong and if I can help or take over. 
HE FAILS to do anything of the sort for me. If I say fu*k under my breath cause I drop some of my food on the floor while plating it or even drop something too loud in the sink.. He's like WHATS WRONG?!? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WHY ARE YOU SO MAD?
another example: at Costco today, I was trying to get around someone going extremely slow, they kept stop starting and shit you not... all I did was clicked my tongue and clenched my jaw a bit from some internal frustration.

My boyfriend is quite calm naturally. Not much phases him. Though when he expresses frustration like a sigh or is mad at something I don't jump to find solutions for him or tell him to calm down. I ask what's wrong and if I can help or take over.

I like to make self deprecating jokes and have always been the ""clown"" in friendship groups so I'm totally fine laughing at myself. 

My ""friend"" suddenly started to make very mean comments aimed at me disguised as a joke. She got the group to somehow laugh at me and the cute ""funny"" anecdote I shared from my childhood suddenly became ""she is so stupid let's laugh at her"". When we would talk about serious things and I would share my opinion, she would just burst out laughing like I said something and then I asked ""what's funny?"" and she would say ""nothing, just the way you said it is funny""

My other friend was showing me a video that really upset her and I was trying to sympathise with her and I said ""ya it's a very sad clip"". The ""friend"" saw the video and said ""ya I think its sad but it's not as sad as you(me) are making it seem, you're just pretending so she (other friend) will like you"". And then she laughs as if it is a joke.  
I was too stunned to speak. Other people also called her a ""school bully"" jokingly and she just started to say ""oh I wasn't a bully, I was just cool""

She also goes on to make fun of the gift I got my friend saying it is ugly. She never behaved this way before so I have no idea where this came from. 

  
I left the gathering thinking I am never going to talk to her again. She texted me apologising for her behaviour so she probably knew she did something wrong.

17,1g2tqjn,AITA? Trying to understand bridal drama. I think I messed up.,"TLDR: After agreeing to be my best friend's maid of honor, logistical issues with the wedding date, a dress mishap, and conflicting advice from another bridesmaid have created significant tension, making me question my role and I'd like outsider perspectives on whether I am the asshole and if I should apologize. I'm not built for this type of drama.

My best friend asked me to be the maid of honor (MOH) at her wedding. I was thrilled and jumped into action finding venues, vendors, and¬†making spreadsheets of all she needs within her price range. She selected a date, and given that there‚Äôs a few months to prepare, her preferred date is not available at the places she wanted, which was a Saturday. Her options were to do it Friday evening or anytime Sunday. She told me she was open to both. After talking to my friend, who is also a bridesmaid (let‚Äôs call her Bridesmaid #1), she and I agreed Friday at 5 pm in perhaps one of the worst traffic areas of our state will mean we all need to take the day off from work, not send kids to school, or pick them up early. Early pickup may mean several hours on the road for me that day, and this will take away my ability to help set up and be there for the bride. Factoring in the Thursday rehearsal, that turns into 2 days of vacation, and an extra hotel expense to Bridesmaid #1, who is even farther away and is taking care of her elderly father with serious health issues (also adding a nurse care cost for her). In summary, Bridesmaid #1 and I see it as a logistical nightmare. I tried explaining this to her and said if there was no difference in price, we should consider Sunday. This was BAD. She spiraled out of control, and I'm confused because she was open to Sunday at first.

Then I may have accidentally made things worse by trying on 2 bridesmaid dresses for her to select the color she wanted. This was the same day as her wedding gown shopping. I was thinking practically‚Ä¶ we are all there from different areas and we won‚Äôt have another chance to talk about these selections as a group in person. She was extremely upset when I came out of the dressing room. I saw this, naively went to her, hugged her, and asked: ‚ÄúAre you ok?‚Äù¬†¬†She stood still, did not hug back, and said nothing. Now I know this is not just me¬†*thinking*¬†she‚Äôs mad. I know it.¬†

After that, we went to dinner. I tried walking on the eggshells and somehow messed up once again. They were talking about shoes and I said she should select the shoes she wants, and¬†we will go with that. Bridesmaid #2 told her to go in a different direction and when I smiled and said ‚Äúyou should stick to what you love,‚Äù I offended this bridesmaid. She said ‚Äúoh, you mean she shouldn‚Äôt listen to me?‚Äù across the dinner table. Bridesmaid #2 is on attack mode.

I hate all of this, and if it will ruin our friendship, I want out of the MOH role. But I also want outsider perspectives. Am I the asshole here?¬†Do I apologize for any of this? I seriously don't know what to think.

Let me begin this post by describing few traits about me,
I have an habit of critizing anything which i strongly disagree with,
Had anger issues since childhood,
I get frustrated easily,


So one day when our family was going out and my mum was driving,

She almost hit an mercedes benz because of her negligence,
She was scrolling through her phone.

So to prevent it I had to alert her and thank God, my mum stopped few cms away while holding her phone.

I was very pissed and i raised my voice and shouted on her saying I have said her many times not to use phones while driving, and if it weren't for me now we would have rear ended a benz. 


But for doing what I was scolded by the entire family. My aunt my cousin my mom for scolding in such a loud voice.


And my mom started crying.


But imo any1 else in my situation would have done the same after all that warnings about not to use phones previously while driving.

This story starts off at a football game. Our band does halftime, and its pretty fun. On our way to put our stuff away, a band member runs up to our director and states ""Lae passed out."" He dropped everything and made his way back to her.

To people wondering if she is okay, a member caught her before she hit the ground, and carried her up to where we were at. 

While trying to get in contact with her parents, a girl mentioned that Lae was fasting. Some people understood, and we had to explain it to them.

To understand what it is, I recommend doing some research. It's important for this story.

The next day, we had state marching band. While at morning practice before we left, Lae passed out again. Our band director asked if she wanted to sit out for today, but she refused, stating it was her senior year, and she wasn't going to be on the sidelines for her final year. 

While we were there, after we preformed, they took her to the bus, while the rest of us got our photos taken. She came out in time to get her picture taken and to do group photos. While everyone was getting undressed, they had Lae lay on the ground in the shade with her knees to her chest.

A boy, who we are gonna call Alex (not his real name) thought that it was a good time to take a picture of her, and caption it ""about to give birth"". He posted it on the school snapchat story, and it was shared around a lot.

Me and Alex used to be really close. Once I saw that he posted it on snapchat, I asked him to take it down, because it was rude, disrespectful, and a invasion of her privacy. He said that he wasn't going to take it down, because it was funny.

I asked him again, to please take it down, and he refused again, only this time stating that ""she deserves the embarrassment because she's fasting and fasting is gross and disgusting and she's supporting the wrong religion.""

I completely flipped out when he said that. I told him that he was sick for thinking that its okay to be disrespectful towards someone's religion. 

At this point, his friend, lets call him Bray, got into Alex's phone, and deleted the story, and he also told the director about the situation. He moved Alex to a different bus, because he knew that it would only lead to bigger problems, and that he would be talking to Alex's parents.

Growing up, we had this home church that we attended for 10 years. It was pretty chill, everyone knew everyone, and it wasn‚Äôt overly strict or anything. We‚Äôd go on Sundays, but it wasn‚Äôt my whole life.

Everything changed a few months ago when my dad came home. He‚Äôs always been religious, but now it‚Äôs like it‚Äôs the ONLY thing he cares about. As soon as he came back, we left our old church without much discussion. We‚Äôre now going to this super religious church that feels¬†*different*. It‚Äôs hard to describe, but it‚Äôs like they have all these weird rules, and it‚Äôs intense‚Äîalmost culty. Every single Sunday, we‚Äôre there for hours. It‚Äôs not just a service anymore; it‚Äôs this whole day thing, and I honestly can‚Äôt stand it.

What‚Äôs worse is that I never get a break. Between school, homework, and now all this church stuff, I feel like I‚Äôm drowning. Saturdays used to be the only time I had to myself, but now it‚Äôs become ""chore day."" I spend all day doing chores around the house because my parents say we need to keep things in order, and I have to ""pull my weight."" So, when it comes down to it, I only get time to sleep. I‚Äôm exhausted.

This morning, I finally put my foot down. I told my parents that I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this, that I need a break. I was just asking for some time to rest, but instead of listening, they flipped out. They took all of my stuff out of my room‚ÄîTV, phone, everything. It‚Äôs like they want to make me feel even more trapped.

And to top it all off, my sister (15F) has been caught doing drugs before, sneaking out, and breaking rules, and barely anything happened to her. She didn‚Äôt get grounded, no major consequences, nothing taken from her just a yelling. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm over here following every rule except this one thing about church, and they go nuclear on me. It feels like they only care about me when I mess up or don‚Äôt do exactly what they want.

Honestly, I feel like they care more about church than they do about me. Like I‚Äôm just another part of the routine or some ""responsibility"" to them, not their actual kid who‚Äôs tired and struggling.

It‚Äôs hard to describe, but it‚Äôs like they have all these weird rules, and it‚Äôs intense‚Äîalmost culty. Every single Sunday, we‚Äôre there for hours. It‚Äôs not just a service anymore; it‚Äôs this whole day thing, and I honestly can‚Äôt stand it.

What‚Äôs worse is that I never get a break. Between school, homework, and now all this church stuff, I feel like I‚Äôm drowning. Saturdays used to be the only time I had to myself, but now it‚Äôs become ""chore day."" I spend all day doing chores around the house because my parents say we need to keep things in order, and I have to ""pull my weight."" So, when it comes down to it, I only get time to sleep. I‚Äôm exhausted.

This morning, I finally put my foot down. I told my parents that I couldn‚Äôt keep doing this, that I need a break. I was just asking for some time to rest, but instead of listening, they flipped out. They took all of my stuff out of my room‚ÄîTV, phone, everything. It‚Äôs like they want to make me feel even more trapped.

And to top it all off, my sister (15F) has been caught doing drugs before, sneaking out, and breaking rules, and barely anything happened to her. She didn‚Äôt get grounded, no major consequences, nothing taken from her just a yelling. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm over here following every rule except this one thing about church, and they go nuclear on me. It feels like they only care about me when I mess up or don‚Äôt do exactly what they want.

Honestly, I feel like they care more about church than they do about me. Like I‚Äôm just another part of the routine or some ""responsibility"" to them, not their actual kid who‚Äôs tired and struggling. All I‚Äôm asking for is a little understanding, but it‚Äôs like church comes first, no matter what.

So, AITA for standing up for myself and not wanting to go to church every Sunday anymore? Or are they right to punish me like this?",0.0,-0.0008057199884206057,0,1

Two days ago after school I was in the school bathroom touching up my make up and my hair when all of a sudden my best friend walks in and she looks very upset. I ask her what‚Äôs wrong and then she starts telling me this boy that we aren‚Äôt close with called her fat in the class that she just had .
I know this girl really well and I also know that she‚Äôs not one to cry over something that somebody says. she‚Äôs very much ‚ÄúI know my body just as much as I know 2+2 =4‚Äù so nothing really gets to her at all
I knew that for the past couple of days this boy had been really mean to her, but she still stuck it out and would still make jokes with him and they would overall just be sorta friends 
This was her breaking point and I knew that this was not OK so I went to go find him and talk to him. I should‚Äôve calmed down a little bit before going to talk to him because I end up yelling at him and his mom cuts in front of me and started yelling at me.

We've just been living with it till my mom decided to call someone about it. She was talking to my sibling about how it's 100% my fault that it's broken. I didn't really care, like, ya sure they can say that. They were getting into insults territory, ""She's so selfish, she never considers what others think"". My mom says that a lot at very random times to very random people to the point where it's lost meaning to me so again, whatever, I just continued doing my thing. But then my mom said something that REALLY upset me

""You'd think someone who claims to have depression would be a lot more considerate""

For context, I'm diagnosed w/ depression, specifically bipolar disorder. And for years my mom has claimed I'm faking it, even though it's printed on paper that I have it. My therapist and psychiatrist have pleaded with her to understand how really bad my mental health is but she always insists I'm faking it for attention. What she said, reads to me that she's once again trying to claim I'm faking, which pissed me off.

I threw my phone down on the floor and screamed ""Fine! I'LL fix it!"" and stormed to the bathroom. She got very mad and yelled at me to come back downstairs, but I knew I'd just yell at her again if I did so I just stayed in the bathroom calming down. When I finally calmed down I came out and she said she was seizing my phone. Fine. Sucks, but fine. She also claimed I threw it at her, which I didn't. She wasn't even in the same room when I threw it at the floor. I just quietly went to my room and for about 10 minutes she continued yelling about how disobedient and disrespectful I am and how I'm a terrible person in a nutshell.

I'm still mad, but also feel bad. I really didn't want to yell but it kinda just- Happened- It felt like I couldn't hold it back. I want to apologize, but, my mom's emotionally abusive (my therapist's words, and my social worker's, and pretty much everyone who's talked to her) and often uses me apologizing as a chance to gaslight me.

24,1g2s31j,AITA For Not Paying My Coworker,"I have always had a love of sports growing up. Didn't matter what sport it was, I loved playing it. So when I got to college, I played every intramural imaginable, often times for like 4 hours a night. For every championship I won, I got a T-shirt. These became my pride and joy. Upon graduating I had collected 20 of these. I was told I could get these made into a T-shirt quilt and now I wanted one. 

Fast forward to the end of my first year of teaching. It came up in conversation with another colleague of mine that she quilted. I explained the project and she said she would have no problem cutting out the squares from my shirts and making them into a quilt. I dropped them off the last day of school and she said it would get done over the summer. Well when I arrived back for my second year, she explained she got really busy over the summer and couldn't get it done. I was disappointed but understood. She said no worries, she will get it done by the end of the school year. Well that didn't happen either. Her plan was now to do it over the summer once more. 

Well the third year started and it still wasn't done. I asked her about it as I was growing impatient. She told me she had actually given them to a friend (another teacher who I worked with) who loved doing that kind of thing and had time to do it. I said okay and went to talk to the other teacher. She said she would cut out the tshirts into squares and prepare them to put into a quilt. She actually had that part done by Christmas so I was excited that it was finally moving along. She told me she was going to a quilting convention in May, and that is when she would finally finish it, right before my wedding as a wedding gift. 

April came along and the ladies son-in-law who I am friends with had heard about my quilt saga for a long time. I had occasionally asked him if he heard any updates since he was over there a lot. He face turned blank one time and I asked what was wrong. He told me she had left the box of my tshirts out on her deck all winter and when she finally looked at them in April, they were moldy and wrecked. I was devasted. 

My wedding was in a week and surprisingly the lady came into my room and said my quilt was done. I didn't understand how that was possible given what the son in law had told me. She brought it in the Thursday before my wedding really excited to show me. There is where I saw the big issue. I gave her 20 shirts to make into a 4x5 quilt. When I say it, there was only 8 of the shirts I gave her in the quilt. The rest of them clearly got wrecked as I was told. She gave them to me and said, ""For your wedding gift, here it is and I'll give you a discount. You only owe me $150.""

After 3 years and over half of my stuff wrecked, I refused to pay her. She now brings it up to my coworkers how I'm cheap, unreliable, and won't ever pay people for services they provided. AITA?

What bothers me most is that my friend  goes back and talks to his ex just as friends. Meanwhile, he keeps telling me it's pointless to try to get back in touch with the girl I like. I genuinely feel like if I could at least talk to her, even just as a friend, it would make me happy.

27,1g2rk22,AITA for judging my grandmas relationship,"My grandma (in her late 70s) and I (in my early 20s) have a pretty good relationship, and she usually shares stories about her life with me. She has dated and married different men throughout her years, and her oldest daughter is my mother. She really cares about my grandma, and nowadays it really doesn‚Äôt matter who my grandma dates as long as she is happy. Last year grandmas latest husband passed away and his family did not let her stay at his house, so she had to move into an apartment and live on her own after many years of mostly being in relationships. She learned to grow more on her own which my mother and I supported her in by letting her sometimes stay at our small guesthouse at our home to give her some company. Last month she searched in a newspaper and found an ad for a man (in his early 80s), let's call him Ben, looking for company and they started messaging. She told me about it, and I found it cute. Later she told me that they started sending heart emojis each day. They decided to see each other in real life and quickly became close and started flirting for real.

One weekend Ben decided to travel to stay at our guesthouse which was an okay plan for my grandma so she gave him our address. We all went to bed that Friday expecting to see him on Saturday at noon, but the next day he came by our house at 5 in the morning. Which means he must have woken up 2 hours earlier just to drive there since he lives kind of far away. Grandma greeted him a bit shocked, they ate breakfast and had a lovely unexpected morning. Later when our family woke up,we decided to greet him. But my mother was already a bit tired of him, Ben not knowing her personal boundaries at her home and him giving her a hug without asking just irritated her mood. What we didn‚Äôt know was that only about two months before Grandma and Ben started talking his wife of over 12 years passed away tragically because of a long sickness. 

But now my grandma has realised that Ben is very immature and embarassing to be around, since he had problems in the past of not even wanting to change anything about him because it's ""too late"" for his age. He still writes to her even though they now have decided to take a break, so I don't know if they still are a thing. Some breaking points were that when he sat with my grandmas small dog in his lap and he just spread his legs and let the dog fall to the ground even though my grandma told him that her dog had expensive surgery on his legs because they are brittle. And something I noticed as well was that he often would talk alot, and sometimes put everyone else under the bus kind of? 

I think me and my family was judging Ben from the beginning, and even his family was judging it. Now I feel bad that maybe me or my mother could have told her about our concerns, but we just wanted to support her. So AITA for judging their relationship? even though it has nothing to do with me?",TL;DR,2024-10-13,"AITA for judging my grandmas relationship My grandma (in her late 70s) and I (in my early 20s) have a pretty good relationship, and she usually shares stories about her life with me. She has dated and married different men throughout her years, and her oldest daughter is my mother. She really cares about my grandma, and nowadays it really doesn‚Äôt matter who my grandma dates as long as she is happy. Last year grandmas latest husband passed away and his family did not let her stay at his house, so she had to move into an apartment and live on her own after many years of mostly being in relationships. She learned to grow more on her own which my mother and I supported her in by letting her sometimes stay at our small guesthouse at our home to give her some company. Last month she searched in a newspaper and found an ad for a man (in his early 80s), let's call him Ben, looking for company and they started messaging. She told me about it, and I found it cute. Later she told me that they started sending heart emojis each day. They decided to see each other in real life and quickly became close and started flirting for real.

One weekend Ben decided to travel to stay at our guesthouse which was an okay plan for my grandma so she gave him our address. We all went to bed that Friday expecting to see him on Saturday at noon, but the next day he came by our house at 5 in the morning. Which means he must have woken up 2 hours earlier just to drive there since he lives kind of far away. Grandma greeted him a bit shocked, they ate breakfast and had a lovely unexpected morning. Later when our family woke up,we decided to greet him.

31,1g2q5ai,AITA for allegedly telling my best friend if she doesn‚Äôt stop her over protective behavior I‚Äôm calling the cops for allegedly stalking me?,"
Me and my best friend Marie (both F, 16y) have been friends since 2nd grade. She has been like a sister to me ever since we have met each other and has always been by each others side all the time. One problem was that when we grew closer and got used to each other Marie starts getting more and more protective of me.

For example she would turn down everyone that I talked with and would always make a big fit about it saying that I don't hang out with her often and would cry about it in hopes she gets my attention. She would also compare me to other beautiful people and start body shaming me saying I eat too much or I am trying to outshine her by being skinny so I have to eat more.

Another problem was there was no way I could talk to other people because she was in all of my classes.

When 10th grade was over, Marie went on a vacation with her family to Florida to visit her grandparents. I never felt so happy in my life. All the weight of pain and depression lifted from my shoulders.

One day while driving to my local coffee shop I saw this guy Jay (M,17y) who was at my school going to the coffee shop I was going to too. We had talked to each other several times but always get interrupted by Marie because of her protective behavior so we never talked that much.

I decided to invite him over to my table because the table was empty and I was in a good mood that day. He immediately came over to my table and we had a good time and a good laugh, we also exchanged numbers considering the fact that my contacts are only my mom, dad, and ofc, Marie, so I was really happy I have someone to talk to over the summer while Marie was gone.

After that day, me and Jay would constantly talk to each other and have dates constantly, to the point he asked to be his girlfriend forever. I ofc said yes.

Summer break was over and 11th grade started and unfortunately Marie was back to school happy to see me and for reason, that day was also a good day for me so I told her how me and Jay are officially dating. After I said those words, she immediately starts crying saying she never agreed to make me go on a date and get a boyfriend. I told her to suck it up because she needs to learn to let me live my life and let her understand that she needs to be kind to others too.

She immediately calls me a fat ass and a bitch while also crying and screaming while also hitting me hard to the point where at some parts I start bleeding or bruising. All the teachers were dragging her away.

After that I never heard a word of Marie ever again and eventually changed my entire schedule so I wouldn't have any classes with her anymore. But for some reason everyone kept telling me Marie is stalking me outside of school and in the school.

I confronted Marie about it and she said many uncanny things that I don't want to say, but I can tell you they were life threatening and disturbing. I told her if she doesn't stop I will call the cops on her and she will be taken away for good. She said that she was going to take me somewhere dark and scary while I was sleeping.

I felt so creeped out that I confronted my parents about the situation and that they were going to call the principal and the cops on her. I felt so bad and ended crying for hours, potentially begging my parents to not call them. They didn't call the cops but they told the principal which immediately expelled her from the district and the school.

I‚Äòm still in touch with Marie‚Äòs parents and they told me shitty stuff saying that I was the reason that she‚Äôs now expelled and in a mental hospital. I eventually blocked them because they kept sending me death threats and shitty stuff.

34,1g2opc8,WIBTA if I told my struggling friend to stop dumping his problems on my lap.,"I have a friend who I really like and is an all around a nice person. He is also poor, works relatively far and has no vehicle. His relationship with his family is also strained and they wouldn't be able to help him much anyway because they are more or less in the same boat. I make more than he does but I am also poor (I make about $30K a year) and after getting to know him better I decided to help him out occasionally with a little cash if he needed it or with a favor such as driving him to and from work. I just wanted to be nice.

The problem is that he's been taking advantage of it (and me) especially as I'm also going through a rough patch myself. Inflation's a bitch y'all. I've talked to him to get to get him to understand that while I get his situation is difficult (he was almost homeless) and that I don't mind helping him out every once in while that I need him to stop reaching to me just to get me to fix his problems. Especially since I have many of my own.

Just as an example at least once a week (it used to be way more frequent) I wake up to a wall of text messages explaining what emergency he has now and how he desperately needs my help. It stresses me out and puts me in a shitty mood to start the day. Now I dread getting texts from him.

Also I mostly ignore his texts to hangout even when I do have free time (which is rare) because its never just actually hanging out. It's always just an excuse so I can do him a favor like taking him to the store or to an appointment where I'm often left alone just waiting for him to finish. By the time we're done it's either too late to do anything or I'm no longer in the mood and just want to go home.

Unfortunately his situation isn't really improving and he won't stop basically guilt tripping me. Again he's actually a nice guy and I do like spending time with him when we do really hangout plus I know he really does need the help. But honestly I'm growing resentful and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I in no uncertain terms tell him to stop making his problems my problem.

I've talked to him to get to get him to understand that while I get his situation is difficult (he was almost homeless) and that I don't mind helping him out every once in while that I need him to stop reaching to me just to get me to fix his problems. Especially since I have many of my own.

Just as an example at least once a week (it used to be way more frequent) I wake up to a wall of text messages explaining what emergency he has now and how he desperately needs my help. It stresses me out and puts me in a shitty mood to start the day. Now I dread getting texts from him.

Also I mostly ignore his texts to hangout even when I do have free time (which is rare) because its never just actually hanging out. It's always just an excuse so I can do him a favor like taking him to the store or to an appointment where I'm often left alone just waiting for him to finish. By the time we're done it's either too late to do anything or I'm no longer in the mood and just want to go home.

Unfortunately his situation isn't really improving and he won't stop basically guilt tripping me. Again he's actually a nice guy and I do like spending time with him when we do really hangout plus I know he really does need the help. But honestly I'm growing resentful and I feel like it's only a matter of time before I in no uncertain terms tell him to stop making his problems my problem.

35,1g2ob3s,AITA for excluding my friend at my birthday party,"It was my birthday yesterday and for my I had a mini birthday dinner with a few of my friends. During the dinner one of my friends left to the bathroom a few times and when I started conversation with her she just answered with a curt yed or no and that's it. Then she started to cry and I asked her if she was okay and if something happened and she said no. Then I asked her if something upset her about what happened today and she said nothing happened today and then she got up and paid for her meal and left the restaurant.

One of my other friends who is closer to her than me went after her and they talked outside and she returned alone saying that my upset friend didn't say why she was upset to her. I then texted her asking if she was okay again, and she replied that she wouldn't be good company as she is and to enjoy my birthday without her. 

But it was very awkward after that for everyone on the table so we stayed for a little bit and went home. The day after she sent me a long message saying that she felt that I and my three other friends purposely excluded her by talking about things she doesn't know anything about and wanted to end our friendship because she doesn't think she can stay friends with people that do that, and she doesn't trust that we wouldn't do it again if we didn't do it on purpose. 

I was stunned because she had told me on the day that we didn't do anything and she was upset about something else also because I didn't think she would see me as someone who would purposely ignore her because on the night I did try to speak to her but I assumed she was upset about something else because she only replied in no and yes and I couldn't continue conversation with her. Also in the past I usually drop everything I'm doing to comfort her when she's upset I help her with writing essays, job applications and am always there for her when she's upset. 

So I replied to her message saying that it was no way my intention to ignore her and thought she was upset about something else and that if she really no longer wants to be friends I'll respect her wishes. And then she replied to me saying that I really don't care about her at all and I should have dropped everything to make sure she was okay since she was crying when she left. And if I was in her situation that she would have done everything to make sure I'm okay.

But now I'm confused because I have no idea what she wanted me to do.

I want to remain friends with her but I've already apologised and promised her something like this won't happen again but she said she feels like my apology wasn't genuine. I have no idea how to go about making up with her.

36,1g2o9s2,AITA for refusing to help get my stepdaughter's to their newest extra curricular activity?,"My husband has two daughters (13 and 12) with his ex-wife. They have been divorced for almost 11 years and we have been married for 7 years and share two kids together ages 6 and 3. His ex-wife is not currently remarried but she did marry twice since the divorce and has two additional children ages 9 and 5.

The co-parenting relationship is very unstable and changeable. Some decisions need to be made via mediation. Others they can agree on to a point. While a few were taken to court for a judge to decided for them.

My relationship with my stepdaughters was good until 3 years ago when their mom's negativity changed how they treat me. They have expressed that they know their mom doesn't like me so they won't like me anymore either. This has been discussed in court and in therapy and nothing has changed. They continue to treat me differently than before. They don't get away with disrespect but they still are way more than before and they're colder with me in general.

Now onto the issue where I want to know if I'm TA. My husband and I are typically really good about communicating and he is a supportive husband and father and has done a good job of keeping me out of his ex-wife's way so she can't say crap to me and also standing up for me. I don't join them for talks about the girls. That's him and his ex but my husband and I will discuss it.

A few months ago the girls said they wanted to take new dance classes 50 minutes from our home. They already do ballet, dancing for fun (which is free) and gymnastics. But these dance classes are different. They're also more expensive than the other extra curricular's they do. I told my husband I thought the new dance classes were too far and too expensive and I said they would not work with the schedule we already have. But when he and his ex sat down to discuss it he agreed to these new dance classes which he and his ex will split 50/50. 

When he told me I wasn't thrilled, because he didn't tell me he was going to agree to them. But I know it's not my decision. But I told him I could not and would not help get the girls there. He told me we'd figure something out. The girls were back with us two days after this talk and they said their mom told them I didn't want them to do these dance classes and sucks to be me because I don't have a say because I'm not their parent. My husband told them not to speak to me like that. He was unable to get his parents to take the girls to the new classes so he wanted me to do it. I put my foot down and said no. He said he can't because he has to work. I told him I have to drop our 6 year old off at his extra curricular that day and it would not work with time. My husband asked his ex if she'd bring them every week and she's saying I'm such an asshole for not driving them and how dare I think I get any say in this.

I (26M) work in a niche government sector where we all know each other quite well. Recently, a colleague of mine, let's call her Pri (25 probably, F), approached me with a request that left me in a difficult position. Pri is a trustworthy and reliable person, and we have a good working relationship. Just to be clear it is purely platonic. I know she is an honest person.

She asked me to cosign a personal loan of ‚Çπ10 lakh for her. She needs the money to buy a shop in her native village, which she believes will significantly improve her husband's financial situation.

I have zero debt and have always been cautious about my financial commitments. Despite my trust in Pri, I felt uncomfortable taking on the responsibility of such a large loan. I explained my concerns to her, saying, ""I understand how important this is for you, but I am not comfortable cosigning a loan of this magnitude. It's a significant financial responsibility, and I am not in a position to take that on.""

Pri became furious and emotional, saying, ""I thought you trusted me! This shop is crucial for my family's future, and the bank won't accept my husband as a cosigner because he is unemployed. I really need your help.""

I felt terrible for saying no, but I stood my ground. It's not about trust, it's about my own financial security and comfort level. I just don't believe in loan. Yes, a Dave Ramsey fan.

However, lately, it feels like I‚Äôve become her only emotional support system. She frequently calls me late at night, sometimes crying about things that happened during the day or worrying about future events. While I understand she‚Äôs going through a tough time, these late-night calls have started to take a toll on my mental health.

I tried to reassure her that I do care, but I can‚Äôt handle the constant emotional weight.

42,1g2mvfo,AITA for not letting my friend bring her dog to my birthday party?,"So I, (17F), had my birthday party. I invited just a few friends to my house to celebrate with us. One of my closest friends is Emily (17F). She has this dog that she cannot get enough of. She takes it everywhere: for school events, to the mall, and even on vacations. And all the time she shares pictures of her dog with us- we find them cute, but too much sometimes.

So when I issued the invitations, Emily requested if she was allowed to bring her dog. I love dogs, but my home has a cat that is more anxious and needy, and I knew that having her around was going to stress that particular animal up really bad. Second, it is my birthday, and I wanted to enjoy a party; I did not want my cat acting up. So, I politely told Emily that it wasn't a good idea for her to bring her dog over due to my cat.

Emily really got mad and said she always brings her dog to accompany her in most of the events; it won't be fair if she leaves her dog home. I offered her that she could just go this time without the dog, but she refused, and she didn't even come to my party.

Several of my other friends are now telling me that I was the unreasonable one, and Emily should have been allowed to bring the dog because it was a part of her life.

43,1g2mhqi,AITA for leaving my bsf's birthday party early ,"Hello, so a couple days ago I (16F) was invited to my best friend we're gonna name Kacy (16F) birthday party. 
We were 13 total and I knew no one since she invited a lot of her friends from her high school. Kacy is very bubbly and social so it was to be expected but she promised me they were all kind and that we were going to play games to warm up.
I am introvert and an awkward person but I wanted to make an effort for my friend since she really wanted me there.

Anyway it starts and I was surprised to see them smoke and drink vodka but I am european so I guessed its not that uncommon. Of course its very awkward for me and for them as they try to talk to me but i am just too stressed and we share no interests whatsoever.
We finally start a game but a lot of them were straight up not listening to the rules, cheating and were non-stop talking loud.
I was overwhelmed and dissociated, needless to say my social battery ran out in 1 hour.

I knew I was going to burst any moment so I decided to leave after the cake. I had to force myself to smile to not ruin their Instagram photos and I just felt so out of place. I know Kacy was sad to see me leave but I think it was for the better because I didn't want her to worry about me during HER birthday party.
I think I should have done better to fit in, as I said they weren't mean to me at all but I felt too out of place. Kacy didn't contact me either since then so maybe they found me weird

44,1g2mdpu,AITA for abstaining to vote a roommate out of our house? ,"
For the sake I‚Äôve keeping things private I‚Äôll change our names

Three of us (myself, Jeff & Steve) have lived together as roommates for over a year now and haven‚Äôt had any major issues up until this point. Our close friend Kevin ended up moving in to the house about four months ago since we wanted to cut rent between us by a bit. Prior to Kevin the bedroom was basically an office space we‚Äôd use whenever we wanted to work from home. This morning we had an argument which lead to a vote which I abstained from as I‚Äôm not sure what to decide 

Last Friday the three of us (myself, Jeff & Steve) had our own separate plans and left the house for the night. Kevin was the only one alone at the time and it stayed that way until he had someone come over.

Now we all have our own designated sections of the pantry where we‚Äôll put our things on. Often enough we‚Äôll share our food with the rest of the house but it‚Äôs understood to ask first before you take anything. Since Kevin was with a friend they decided to get drunk and he made his was into the closet 

Jeff had a bottle of Hennessy stashed in the pantry for occasion and it was a little over half still left by Kevin‚Äôs record. Since he was lazy and didn‚Äôt even want to order the bottle online he ended up taking it for himself and the rest of the night went on 

On Saturday afternoon, Kevin goes to Jeff and tells him what happened along with showing him he bought a new bottle to replace what he took. Jeff gets upset that he violated the rules and didn‚Äôt even bother to ask him before taking the bottle for himself. One thing leads to another and Jeff hits us two (Steve and myself) on our group text to ask to kick him out 

As far as votes go Steve said no and I abstained which lead to a draw. Jeff is upset with both of us but I personally think he‚Äôs taking it a bit too far. While I understand he wasn‚Äôt considerate to leave Jeff‚Äôs things alone he told him about it and gave him a new bottle to replace it. I personally think the additional alcohol is good enough of a consolation to let things be, but I can‚Äôt tell another person how to feel about something.

My mom said I am selfish because I already had a dog and that those people were capable of caring for them too because they're important people in town and have the money. Now I'm wondering if it was alright for them to just take the puppies away. If they asked, I would've gave the puppies to them but them just taking them away with no permission just seems rude right?

Edit for Clarification before the story; My mama asked us to stay with her for atleast a year after our baby was born so that we can get settled and figure out (more of me figure out as my fiance had a baby sister he basically raised from birth) how to parent and navigate life with this new major change as well as us being as young as we are along with NO this was not a planned pregnancy

Heres where the issues start, My babys nursery is my old bedroom and also my stepdads old office, he insists on sleeping in my babys nursery which currently isnt an issue as my baby is in the ICC however I do not want him sleeping in there when my baby comes home, he has argued with me that 'someone should sleep with the baby' I truly dont understand why he doesn't sleep with my mom as she even bought a bigger bed to fit her him and the two pups, he claims that my baby's nursery is where anyone whos sick should sleep to not get my mama sick, that also doesn't make sense to me, why expose a baby to sickness willingly? He regularly uses my bathroom which I wouldnt have an issue with however, despite being 60, he pees on the floor REGULARLY, Ive never had that issue with my bio-dad or my fianc√© (both male) I tried setting a boundary with him 4 YEARS ago not to use my bathroom as he regularly trashes it and I have very bad sensory issues and tend to be quite germaphobic, I find it incredibly disrespectful that he can even clean up after himself and also that he disrespects my mama like this because she went out of her way to make things easier for all of us with him being home, hes usually on deployment (not military) so its not an issue typically but every time he comes home he ""forgets"" my boundaries and trashes my bathroom which leads to a breakdown for me as Im the one who has to clean his mess :(

Small Edit: This all came to a head when I came home from the hospital after giving birth and there was pee all over my floor and hair everywhere, not mine as I cleaned before I was admitted, so I went from a very clean place (the hospital) and came home to a mess when I know I didnt leave it that way.

A little more context: The only reason I could think he dislikes my fianc√© so much is because my fianc√© very politely honestly asked him to stop doing something during an OB appointment that we invited him to (per my mamas request) during the entire appointment my stepdad was acting like a child along with trying to tell the doctors they didnt know what they were talking about because ""I went to medical school"" hes literally a history major, he then went to my mama saying ""no kid should yell at me like that"" My fianc√© never raised his voice, there wasnt aggression or malice in his tone he just politely asked him to stop.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-13,"AITA for not letting my stepdad use my bathroom?

This led into her talking about how people don‚Äôt care about animals, aninal slaughter, and how they‚Äôre raised.

This is when I got upset, because I have never once commented about her eating habits. I told her that if she doesn‚Äôt want to eat meat, that‚Äôs her choice, but she shouldn‚Äôt force her beliefs on other people. I also told her since she‚Äôs been watching those documentaries, her reality has been completely warped. 

After some arguing, she has now gone to bed and hasn‚Äôt spoken much to me since the discussion.

52,1g2jtm6,AITA - Friends Bachelor Party,"TL:DR I was engaged to my fiance for over a year, up until 2 weeks ago, until she found out that I had lied about my presence at a bachelor party strip show in watching but not participating.

To start, my partner has some anxieties around aspects including wanting me to look away during any female nudity in movies even if the context was a dead body, and if I didn‚Äôt she would become very upset. She is also vigilant about me looking at other women. If I said that it was coincidence or that I hadn‚Äôt noticed what she was referring to, or when I would acknowledge I had looked, this was also upsetting for her.

I got invited to a bachelor party, and we never spoke about whether there would be a stripper there. Previously we spoke about how we would never have one at our own parties, and we both agreed that engaging with one we‚Äôd consider cheating. 
At the party, I sat away from the group while she did the show for the groom. I was on a chair by the kitchen while the rest of the group sat on couches in the living room. The stripper went around to each guy, trying to get them to eat things from her body etc. and I rejected her from coming into my space, the only one to do so. I didn‚Äôt enjoy sitting in, and I found myself looking away for large portions. I left with a confirmed feeling of how that stuff wasn‚Äôt for me.

I got home, I could tell my partner was anxious. She had a written list of questions of where we went, what we did, and whether there was a stripper. I told her there was, but I said I had left the room. I lied. I thought it would be the easier road, by keeping this lie, knowing that at the heart of it, there was nothing that occurred that sullied our relationship. However she is traditional, and was shocked about hearing what happened.

A week later she tells me she knows there is more, but I‚Äôm in a safe space to tell her and she won‚Äôt get mad. She had gone through the group chat of the guys that were there. I don‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs found, so I come clean after some difficulty not really knowing what she was talking about. 

She loses it, says I‚Äôve cheated on her based on our agreement.
She says I don‚Äôt have the same values as her, that I‚Äôve coveted and there was something missing in our relationship.

AITA? I really give/gave my fiance so much energy, time and love, and adhered to so many of her requests of my behaviour previously. I‚Äôve given her no reason to doubt my fidelity, though I must acknowledge that I have hid things out of worry what she might think or say. I‚Äôve smoked weed without her knowing, and taken ADHD meds when I know she is anti pharmaceutical and drugs. 

I made a poor choice, and I regretted sitting in on the show. But I kept my distance and I thought that would be enough. We are both working professionals, two months away from going on a 9 month trip around Europe, were looking at buying property together. And all of that is gone.

53,1g2jsgk,AITA for telling my neighbor to use their own water?,"Some background my wife and I moved to a duplex last month. We've lived in apartments our whole lives and never had to pay for water/sewer/garbage and now we do. We haven't gotten our utility bill yet (comes every two months) and I'm dreading the number.

There is a detached garage building at the front of the lot. On this garage unit are two faucets, one on their side and one on ours. When we moved in, there was a hose already attached to our side so I thought the previous tenant just left it and bought myself a nozzle. We recently noticed that the neighbor's wife will use that hose several times a week to water the garden area and wash shoes. I was looking for the right time to ask them about this and it just so happened today she walked by while I was building a shelf in the garage. I asked if the faucet was connected to our meter or theirs and she said she'd ask the husband.

He came out a few minutes later and asked what the problem was. I asked the same question and he said we can check by closing the valves on our side but added I was the first to ask and the previous two neighbors never made a big deal out of it and that his wife only used it to water the front lawn. But here the wife interjected and confessed she washed shoes a few times a week (which she had to as I was just there 10 minutes before when she was washing shoes). He cut her off and said ""No, you don't, you never wash shoes"".

Lo and behold that faucet is attached to our water meter. I asked if the hose was his to which he answered yes and then he asked if I would like to move the hose to the other faucet to which I nodded. I could tell he was pretty upset from the earlier comments and he was continually grumbling stuff like: ""oh ok since you want to be so strict"", ""my wife only uses like 3 cents of water"", ""i was gonna give you a power washer to help wash your car but ok I guess not"", and shit like that.

Guess he was pretty flustered as he couldn't unscrew the hose. He came back with a wrench and still couldn't do it. While he was gone a second time, I unscrewed the hose (he probably loosened it, I'll give him that), took my nozzle off, and screwed the hose onto his faucet. When he came back, he saw it was done then talked to me a little about putting a ""Smile, You're on Camera!"" sticker to our backyard door as he was concerned about dog walkers not cleaning up after their pets on our front lawn (I obliged and the sticker is on our yard door).

Should I have just let them use our water? She doesn't really use too much and he could be right about the 3 cents (ballpark). [The way I read the water billing here we pay $5.29 per CCF for the first 10 CCF, $6.17 per unit thereafter].

Due to the fact that I'm an only child my parents are extremely controlling and expect me to be perfect in everything. My dad grew up in an abusive household and likewise is abusive. My mom's been diagnosed with OCD and is not the person you want to be around. My only source of comfort are my friends, my phone and my bed. I spent most of my time in my room on my bed either talking to my friends, reading comics, playing video games and studying so its a sort of comfort place for me since i seek shelter in my bed when my parents are fighting.

This summer my parents moved in my room since their ac wasn't working and i had to sleep in the mattress. I was uncomfortable since my bed was a comfort place for me but they told me to suck it up. I was awake all night and then I heard them doing the deed. I was pretty traumatized and couldn't look at my bed the same again. this wasn't the first time I heard them doing the deed since last winter i was in their room cuz my rooms heater broke (yes I know a lot of things get broken, like me but anyways) and they did the deed while i was in the room but at least I had a comfort place to go to after that but now i didn't. I was furious but my friend clamed me down.

Anyways fast-forward to now. Me and my mom are currently living in my grandparents (maternal side) house along with my uncle and aunt (maternal side) cuz my dads in the military and we have to move every 2-3 years to a new city and we haven't gotten a place to stay yet. Now I'm very emotionally attached to my grandparents, they've basically raised me when my dad was being an absent father; working on his job and my mom was trauma dumping on me since i was 5 but i cant really tell them everything I just like being in their presence.

My grandmother passed away 3 years ago and though I may not show it i miss her very much. I cherish every last thing she left behind and look at her photos from time to time. Now my grandparents bed is also a comfort place;its filled of memories of them telling me stories, watching cartoons with me, making me fall asleep,etc. ive always tried my best to not leave a stain on the bedsheet and always make the bed whenever i wake up as a way of perserving those memories. My grandfather is in Australia now since my aunt called him to visit her and me and my mom sleep on their bed. The day before yesterday my dad came to visit us and the same thing occur but this time it was at morning around 6. this time I had enough I packed my stuff when they were sleeping and went upstairs and set my room.

 have any sets and wanted to forfeit while I and another player (potential winner) continued to develop their streets.

He got upset and tried to proposed me additional money without a specific number along with utilities. I got hesitant and he didn‚Äôt try to trade it further with me and nothing happened. 

Throughout the game he complained he didn‚Äôt 
 have any sets and wanted to forfeit while I and another player (potential winner) continued to develop their streets. 

Then Sergio tried to trade same cards with me again without any specificity and I got hesitant again. Other players tried to convince me to trade with him but he got super angry and said he won‚Äôt trade with me and that‚Äôs the end of it. Then he said he is going to leave the game and everybody started urging me to trade with him to keep the game ‚Äúfun‚Äù. I refused just because it felt unfair to me - why should I help Sergio to stay in the game and take disadvantageous deal while he is acting so arrogant. (If he lose, he lose, am I wrong?)

But everybody started arguing with me saying I was an AH for not keeping game going. All in all, he had to stop the game and everybody blamed me. 
So, AITA for refusing to trade? ",0.0,0.03149263560771942,0,1

60,1g2io5l,AITA for getting getting pissed telling off my girlfriend just because of an NSYNC song?,"Title glitched, it‚Äôs AITA for getting pissed off and then telling off my girlfriend just because of an NSYNC song

For context, I (23F) have a girlfriend (20F) that is a fan of multiple genres of music. A few months ago Deadpool and Wolverine came around theaters and it featured a song from NSYNC which most of you probably can guess already, BYE BYE BYE. It instantly became an earworm for me to the point that I can‚Äôt stop singing it from the first week of hearing it to atleast two weeks. Majority of you know the iconic song title part of the song wherein there sing ‚ÄúBye Bye Bye‚Äù with the extra ‚ÄúBye Bye‚Äù in the background. Whenever I sing, I always sing the background voices because it‚Äôs fun for me and also because sometimes I feel like the song is incomplete when I sing without the background lines. 

My girlfriend however, is very weirded out by it. Trust me when I say that she‚Äôs very caring, very kind and considerate and etc. Basically what you‚Äôd want in a partner and we‚Äôve been together for more than 5 years. The only catch is that she gets weirded out whenever I sing the background lines. The first time she pointed it out to me she made a ‚Äúvery weirded out face‚Äù where her eyebrows scrunched and she had an almost scowl in her face and told me ‚Äúwhy do you sing those extra lines? It‚Äôs very weird.‚Äù I explained to her how I felt about singing like what I said above. I didn‚Äôt pay no mind much since she might just be pointing it out. The next time it happened however, she once again laughed and pointed it out how weird it was. I got a bit upset because I‚Äôve been bullied before when I was still in highschool for being ‚Äúweird‚Äù and explained to her that‚Äôs just how I sing.

Long story short, everytime I sing the song BYE BYE BYE and I add the extra ‚ÄúBye Bye‚Äù at the end, she chuckles and keeps mentioning it‚Äôs weird. One day I just told her off how hearing her say it‚Äôs weird multiple times throughout the week just icked me to the point of frustration. She got upset as well and told me how she found it weird because she never heard anyone sing it like how I do. After telling her how I felt and how upset I got, I just kept silent about the song. This was around a month ago.

Cut to the present, the song played on my spotify radio and she asked me to sing it, probably remembering what I told her, and I just don‚Äôt feel comfortable singing it whenever she‚Äôs in proximity anymore.

Was I an asshole for telling her off? I might just be overreacting but I don‚Äôt really know.

EDIT: a lot of people might get confused. No I did not tell her off for the first two comments because I just thought she was poking fun, I only got bothered AFTER she repeatedly called me weird over the week. No I don‚Äôt have problems in our relationship

Yes I love her very much and I would do ANYTHING for this woman

To the people saying I shouldn‚Äôt be trauma dumping at my partner just because I was bullied back in highschool, no I was not trauma dumping. i was merely making a reference as to why I felt uncomfortable getting called weird repetitively.

62,1g2hy55,AITA because I don‚Äôt want my one day off to consist of babysitting?,"I 16F, go to school 4 days a week (mon-thurs) and from fri-sat i go to work 10-5:30. I always have Sunday‚Äôs off. Recently my mom who has been attempting to go back into the workforce wants me to switch my work schedule and have Friday be my day off, and not Sunday. Here‚Äôs the catch, i have a little brother (4). My mom claims a lot of the jobs she‚Äôs aiming for want her to work fridays and that i‚Äôll need to watch my lil bro for a ‚Äúfew hours‚Äù (yeah sure mom) until she gets off of her shift. 

My little brother is a constant piece of work, and is more full of energy than a semi full of red-bull drinks. He isn‚Äôt a bad kid however, he is extremely curious about everything and loves making messes, without any bad intentions of course. This means he must be monitored at all times. I love my brother more than any one person i know, however, i need my resting time and my breaks. 

The whole idea of me switching my schedule around just so my mom can work sounds good, but it really only benefits her. When i have Sundays off it gives me one day of peace before i start another week of school and work, and along with opportunities for sleepovers on Saturday nights with my friends because their schedules are similar. Fridays just wouldn‚Äôt work out.

This puts me in a frustrating position with my parents. I told my dad about how i didn‚Äôt want to change my schedule because it would mean i would have to watch my brother on my one day off, and i deserve a break. To nobody‚Äôs surprise he starts going off at me. He loves to bring up his past and how he had to similar things growing up due to his massive mormon family with around 10 siblings, and the way he had to watch his family. 

Now, incase nobody on this planet has noticed, times have changed. It‚Äôs normal for a human being to ask for time to their self and i feel as though others should respect that. He claimed that i was selfish and how they had to watch me as a baby growing up (huh üò≠), then after i claimed that my brother wasn‚Äôt my kid he just said that i need to get over myself and how ‚Äúthat‚Äôs life‚Äù. 

I‚Äôm filled with annoyance and i feel the farthest thing from being understood. I am predicting a bigger argument will happen after my mom starts making moves such as getting a job and getting a schedule. I have never been a maternal person (mother trauma core) so it‚Äôs never been a joy to watch or babysit kids, i often prefer to avoid the whole thing. This puts me in a hard spot so i really don‚Äôt know how to navigate this. I feel like i‚Äôm being treated unfairly and this is unjust, this sucks and i‚Äôm miserable lol end of story.

(for clarification: daycare is a no go trust me i tried, my mom as of recently (5 years) has only had one other job which was during this summer and she quit due to ‚Äúdrama‚Äù. she does breed dogs so her money isn‚Äôt entirely of my dads check. and lastly my dad does work fridays and has my entire life so there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs changing HIS schedule.) 

Edit: I want to thank all of you guys for making me feel so less alone on my side and that i‚Äôm not crazy for feeling this way! I also have another factor in this that clears up some stuff that u guys were saying. 

Me and my little brother go to the same school, for the same hours. Our school is preschool all the way through high school. He‚Äôs in pre-k and i am a junior. This means we both share our days off of school. (fri-sun) My mom watches him whenever me and my dad are at work. Then usually my dad takes over. 

In the past ive obviously been asked to babysit him which i have done. But this is different because it will be a consistent thing that will happen. I also agree that it will definitely cause me a major burn out over time, in a few weeks is my guess. I have always worshiped my alone time and it is important to me. Frankly they don‚Äôt care, i don‚Äôt know how to make them understand that I will turn into a ticking time bomb if everything goes with their plan. I can see my meltdown from a mile away, but they haven‚Äôt even looked down the road to see it.

I also sadly don‚Äôt have a vehicle, which means they have control of when i go to work and other places. In the past they have used this concept to manipulate me.

65,1g2hgef,AITA for refusing to loan money to my parents after I was taken off work due to a car accident? ,"I (32F) and my husband (36M) have three young kids (4, 3, 1) and are being shunned by my family. My parents have always struggled financially. For the past four years, we‚Äôve been paying my mom to watch our kids about eight hours a week while we work. Recently, my parents‚Äô car broke down, and they were down to one vehicle between them, my 18-year-old sister, and my parents. My husband and I offered to loan them a few thousand dollars to help buy a new car, on the condition that they continue watching our kids. My brother (33M) works at a car dealership, and a few days later he found a car that would work.

Unfortunately, I was recently rear-ended in a car accident and totaled my own vehicle, injuring myself in the process. Due to the injuries, I was taken off work and filed a Workmen‚Äôs Compensation claim. At this point, we were unsure how long I‚Äôd be out of work, but we knew it would be at least a month. When my brother asked for the money for my parents‚Äô car, I told him that we couldn‚Äôt afford it at the moment, given that we just lost our vehicle and were waiting to see if Workmen‚Äôs Comp would cover my wages. I suggested if all of us siblings pitched in, it would be easier.

No one asked how I was doing after the accident. Instead, my brother was upset and said it was wrong of us to offer help and then take it back. He then got my sister involved, who expressed the same sentiment. My brother also said he couldn‚Äôt help because he was behind on his mortgage and had over $30,000 in credit card debt due to frivolous spending, including Vegas trips and luxury items. My sister, who just bought an expensive home she knew she couldn‚Äôt afford, said she couldn‚Äôt help either. She and her husband are struggling to cover their mortgage and expenses.

I‚Äôve always made an effort to keep the kids out of family drama, even when my brother and I have fought in the past. I always acknowledged their birthdays and sent gifts, but now my own son is hurt by his cousins‚Äô rejection. I‚Äôm questioning if I was wrong to ask for more time to provide the money for my parents‚Äô car. My brother and sister have always felt entitled to my money and time, but now that I have my own family, I feel they should respect that. I did call out my brother for his behavior and told him he was too old for this kind of drama. Ultimately, my kids are the ones suffering from this shunning.

AITA for asking for more time to contribute to the car, or was I wrong to prioritize my family‚Äôs financial security during a difficult time?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-13,"AITA for refusing to loan money to my parents after I was taken off work due to a car accident?  I (32F) and my husband (36M) have three young kids (4, 3, 1) and are being shunned by my family. My parents have always struggled financially. For the past four years, we‚Äôve been paying my mom to watch our kids about eight hours a week while we work. Recently, my parents‚Äô car broke down, and they were down to one vehicle between them, my 18-year-old sister, and my parents. My husband and I offered to loan them a few thousand dollars to help buy a new car, on the condition that they continue watching our kids. My brother (33M) works at a car dealership, and a few days later he found a car that would work.

Unfortunately, I was recently rear-ended in a car accident and totaled my own vehicle, injuring myself in the process. Due to the injuries, I was taken off work and filed a Workmen‚Äôs Compensation claim. At this point, we were unsure how long I‚Äôd be out of work, but we knew it would be at least a month. When my brother asked for the money for my parents‚Äô car, I told him that we couldn‚Äôt afford it at the moment, given that we just lost our vehicle and were waiting to see if Workmen‚Äôs Comp would cover my wages. I suggested if all of us siblings pitched in, it would be easier.

No one asked how I was doing after the accident. Instead, my brother was upset and said it was wrong of us to offer help and then take it back. He then got my sister involved, who expressed the same sentiment. My brother also said he couldn‚Äôt help because he was behind on his mortgage and had over $30,000 in credit card debt due to frivolous spending, including Vegas trips and luxury items. My sister, who just bought an expensive home she knew she couldn‚Äôt afford, said she couldn‚Äôt help either. She and her husband are struggling to cover their mortgage and expenses.

66,1g2hfbt,AITA for setting expectations at my home,"My daughter (23) just started a well-paying career while living at home with me after graduating from an out-of-state college five months ago. I am a few years away from retirement and spent several thousand dollars to remodel a bed/bath on another level of our home for her, to suit her style and give us our own space, which she enjoys. I paid for her college and she drives a car I purchased for her with the agreement that when she earns a paycheck she would reimburse me $5,000 if she chose to keep the car. She has twice that amount in savings from an internship, but can't begin paying me back because she needs it as her safety net.



After we agreed to her living at home, she began dating a man her age who lives with his parents 30 minutes away while working and finishing college. He seems to be good for her and I enjoy spending time with them...to a point. Over the past 5 months, he has spent a lot more time at our house than I expected, including arriving Friday evenings and leaving Monday mornings for work. They are in and out of the house and spend most of their time in the lower level of our home where her room is, but I'm never sure when they'll pop into my space or be using the kitchen, laundry or other common areas. It's hard to find any time with just her, as the two of them are almost always together even within the house. I sometimes feel like a third wheel in my own home. I also admitted I miss spending some time with just her, which I thought would be a benefit of her moving home, but I can accept that her friends and BF are her priority.



I said now that she will have a regular paycheck, we should talk about her contributing to household expenses like groceries, cell phone bills, personal care items, etc. I am not charging her rent, just requesting a contribution toward incremental expenses. She was immediately offended and defensive because I don't ""need"" the money (although I am trying to contribute to my savings in order to retire). Then she said she'll buy her own food, but didn't think she should be expected to contribute to other household expenses. I also said that as much as I like her BF, he is a guest in our home and I'd like to limit his (or any guest's) time at the house to 1 or 2 nights a week and not every full weekend. Out of courtesy, I would appreciate communicating about plans at the house, but she said she and her college roommates all just did what they wanted without having to coordinate or communicate and she doesn't think it should be any different at home.

67,1g2h1w6,AITA for making my daughter babysit her brother even though she had an assignment due?,"It was just me  (42m), my daughter (16f) and my son (8m) Since her mother was abroad at the time and I had to travel to a different city I asked her to take care of her brother until I returned. My trip would just be a day trip so I would be back by 8 pm latest. I ask her on the Monday that she watch him on Thursday so that she knew in advance and could plan. I said I would be back around  2 to drop off her brother, eat lunch and then go so she might see me. 

On the Thursday she told me that she couldn't watch her brother because she had an assignment due and she was already severely behind. I asked when she got the assignment and she said the previous Friday. So I said well that's poor time management and there's nothing I can do now. So i left to travel to the other city. When I got back at around 7.45pm she asked me to write to the teacher requesting an extension. I told no. That it's her own poor time management that led here. Now her mom is staying I should at least try and help her since she helped me. But I think it's her own actions that led here. AITA.

Edit: Perhaps I need to clarify some things.
1) She asked as I was leaving the house so for me to find someone and take my son there would take way too long.
2) I'm not going to email her teacher because she's blaming me for her not finishing her assignment when she's the one who mismanagemed her time.
3) She's not constantly caring for him. This is maybe the third time this year.

72,1g2g1wl,AITA for not going to sleep at 10PM?,"I (18) live with my parents in their separate houses, so I‚Äôm always clocking back and forth between houses. Recently, my mom imposed a new household rule: no staying up past 10PM. At 10PM, I need to be in bed, or else the whole of my electronics ‚Äî my work laptop, my phone, and my iPad ‚Äî will be locked away in her room.

I‚Äôm a college student in a Computer Generated Images program, and it‚Äôs pretty demanding, so I often stay up late doing assignments. When I try to explain to her that I need to stay past 10PM to make sure my assignments are handed in on time, she does not try to listen to me and just keeps repeating that I cannot stay up past 10PM. She brings up the fact that I should do my work before hanging out with my friends, which is true, but ever since college started hanging out with friends and just having a social life has been increasingly difficult due to the workload in my program, so I try to hang out when I can. I don‚Äôt even go out that much compared to the average young adult, I only go and do something once or twice a week. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love my program, and if I have to go to bed at 12AM to get something finished I have no problem with that. I normally don‚Äôt even feel any repercussions the next day. My mom doesn‚Äôt believe me and insists that if I have to do something, then I should wake up at 3-4 AM to get it done the next day. I am NOT someone who can wake up at 3-4 AM without being severely drowsy/productive at all. I HAVE tried to explain this to her and she just refuses to hear me out. I‚Äôm considering moving to my dad‚Äôs house for heavy workload weeks and go back to hers when the session isn‚Äôt being too intense. 

Before doing that, I just want to know if what I‚Äôm doing is an a-hole move. I know my mom wants the best for me, but I also REALLY need to get work done and I‚Äôm tired of fighting her every night just because I need an extra hour to finish an assignment on time. It‚Äôs ridiculous, and none of my friends have to fight their parents over the time they go to sleep, which just makes me feel even more ridiculed about the situation. My high school was also pretty demanding and I would go to sleep at 11PM normally, so I have no idea why she suddenly switched up on me like this. I almost NEVER go to bed past midnight, and I wake up at 7AM the next morning, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not sleeping enough. 

TLDR: Mom doesn‚Äôt let me sleep past 10PM or else I get all my electronics (including work related ones) taken away and I can‚Äôt finish any of my college assignments done on time because my sleep schedule does not include waking up at 3-4AM to finish an assignment, unfortunately. Considering just moving to my Dad‚Äôs for weeks in which the workload piles up to make her understand I can‚Äôt comply to that rule for my health. AITA?

My mom doesn‚Äôt believe me and insists that if I have to do something, then I should wake up at 3-4 AM to get it done the next day. I am NOT someone who can wake up at 3-4 AM without being severely drowsy/productive at all. I HAVE tried to explain this to her and she just refuses to hear me out. I‚Äôm considering moving to my dad‚Äôs house for heavy workload weeks and go back to hers when the session isn‚Äôt being too intense. 

Before doing that, I just want to know if what I‚Äôm doing is an a-hole move. I know my mom wants the best for me, but I also REALLY need to get work done and I‚Äôm tired of fighting her every night just because I need an extra hour to finish an assignment on time. It‚Äôs ridiculous, and none of my friends have to fight their parents over the time they go to sleep, which just makes me feel even more ridiculed about the situation. My high school was also pretty demanding and I would go to sleep at 11PM normally, so I have no idea why she suddenly switched up on me like this. I almost NEVER go to bed past midnight, and I wake up at 7AM the next morning, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm not sleeping enough. 

TLDR: Mom doesn‚Äôt let me sleep past 10PM or else I get all my electronics (including work related ones) taken away and I can‚Äôt finish any of my college assignments done on time because my sleep schedule does not include waking up at 3-4AM to finish an assignment, unfortunately. Considering just moving to my Dad‚Äôs for weeks in which the workload piles up to make her understand I can‚Äôt comply to that rule for my health. AITA?

77,1g2dust,AITA for not asking if I can use the pull-up bar on the squat rack?,"My gym has two squat racks side by side, both with pull-up bars attached behind them and step platforms where you can stand to reach the pull-up bars. Right behind both squat racks is a deadlift platform.

It's also important to note that, at my gym, I‚Äôve never asked someone deadlifting behind the squat rack if they mind me using the rack or pull-up bar when it‚Äôs clearly not in use, and vice versa. I always purposely step aside between sets to let deadlifters use the mirror if they need it, even when they don't ask me to. As a deadlifter myself, I prefer the mirror too lol. When I‚Äôm the one deadlifting, I don‚Äôt mind if others use the squat rack, and no one has ever asked for my permission to do so.

I wanted to finish my workout with a set of pull-ups, but when I approached the racks, one was occupied by someone squatting. On the other platform, I noticed a woman doing deadlifts. For a few minutes, she was standing around her bar, presumably preparing for her lift, so I waited behind her out of courtesy, allowing her to complete the lift with the mirror in view.

Once she finished, she dropped the bar. I went ahead and did my pull-ups, which took about a minute since I only planned to do one set. After I finished, she got my attention (I had headphones on) and said, ‚ÄòYou should‚Äôve asked.‚Äô I was taken aback and replied, ‚ÄòOh, I was just doing pull-ups,' She then told me that she was planning to use the step platforms to rack her bar and change the weight. I responded, ‚ÄòWell, you were doing deadlifts, and I only had one set,‚Äô and left. She gave me a ""look"" and said, ‚ÄòOkay.‚Äô

In my experience, when someone is using the platforms to rack their weights, they‚Äôre usually positioned close to the rack, making it clear that the rack is in use. In this case, her bar was nowhere near the step platforms, so there was no indication she intended to use them as part of her lift.
