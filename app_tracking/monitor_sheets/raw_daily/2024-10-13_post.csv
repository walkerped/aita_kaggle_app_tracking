0,1g2ghz0,AITA for falling out with a friend after not being picked to go on a trans girls weekend she was hosting?,"So I (39, Trans woman) have most of my community of trans friends online (mostly through Instagram), and in that time, there have been a handful of people who I‚Äôve come to consider friends. 

One of those friends holds a bi-annual ‚Äúgirls weekend‚Äù where people who present female at least some of the time come from across the country for a weekend of fellowship, shopping, going out, and girling out. Even though I‚Äôve transitioned, I still want community, and several people I consider friends go. So, when she announced sign-ups for the next event, I reached out to express interest, and tell her that once I got the okay from my partner, I was going to buy a plane ticket and sign up. A few days later, I asked about logistics, and she gave me information about lodging and how the weekend works. On the last day of signups, I bought a plane ticket and officially signed up. 

The next week, she made an announcement that she (along with a board) selected who got to go, and those selected would be notified that morning. (Wait‚Ä¶ there was a cutoff?)

By afternoon, it was obvious I didn‚Äôt get picked. It wasn‚Äôt a message from her that made me me aware‚Ä¶ it was silence‚Ä¶ nothing. I heard nothing, though I did see a few IG posts from friends who did get picked. 

A couple weeks later and admittedly after I had a few drinks, I decided to reach out to confess that I felt really hurt. One thing that I admit to being an asshole about was that I was much more bitchy than I should have been, though I don‚Äôt regret reaching out.

Just to be clear, I‚Äôm not hurt that I wasn‚Äôt selected‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm hurt that, in the times I‚Äôd reached out to her, including mentioning that I was looking at flights, not once did she bother to tell me that not everyone who signs up gets to go, and once the guest list was finalized, I was practically ghosted by her. 

The next day, she sent a series of ‚Äúincognito messages‚Äù telling me that she had been surprised by me buying a flight, that she and the board agreed to not pick me because they didn‚Äôt want to set a precedent that ‚Äúa way to force yourself in would be to buy a plane ticket,‚Äù became really defensive in her tone, and then told me to block her if I didn‚Äôt like it. I sent a few messages clarifying why I was hurt, asking her to clarify in the future that signing up doesn‚Äôt guarantee you get to come, and then I backed away. 

I feel terrible, humiliated, and, honestly, rejected. After a couple of days, I reached out to a mutual friend to better understand what had happened, but was instantly greeted with a very cold response, and then a lecture about how I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúnot accepted,‚Äù but instead ‚Äúnot selected.‚Äù While I see what she was trying to say, lecturing me on the semantics of accepted vs selected felt like gaslighting when, honestly, I felt rejected. 

So‚Ä¶ was I the asshole in all of this? Had she reached out to me to explain that, I would have totally understood and supported the decision. Instead, I was ghosted and I feel like such an idiot.
