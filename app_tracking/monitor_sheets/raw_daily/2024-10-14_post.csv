0,1g3410h,UPDATE - AITA for telling my father that it was his fault he missed my son's first birthday party?,"Hey guys. I intended to update sooner, but I've been busy these days.

I think my main takeaway from your comments was that it's not my job to placate my father's feelings. He made several conscious decisions that led him to miss the birthday party. He had the right to make those choices, but the consequences were, indeed, his fault.

After deliberating for a while, I called my father to discuss the subject again. I told him I don't expect him to apologize, and I won't hold resentment towards him forever, but he can't expect me to pretend his actions didn't anger me, or that it wasn't his fault. We had a long discussion about it.

Throughout all of it, my father kept trying to play the victim. He'd talk about how he wanted to come to the party, and was upset he'd missed it. At one point he said, ""You don't understand, I didn't *want* to go to the church.""

I told him I don't care, what matters is that he did. He could have told his girlfriend he didn't want to go, but he didn't. He could have left the church early, but he didn't. He could have prioritized his previous commitment and not attended the event in the first place, but he didn't. Everything he did that day was within his control.

I won't get into the specifics of the discussion itself, but I will say that it took a while. I explained that if he wants to prioritize his girlfriend over his grandchild, the least he can do is be upfront about it. That means either not making promises he can't keep or acknowledging his responsibility when he makes regretful decisions.

My father did end up apologizing (and, more importantly, taking accountability). I forgave him, but I intend to be wary from now on. Looking back, I don't feel like I was ever able to truly rely on my father. Back then, he would miss events because he had a complicated work schedule. But now that I know he's also capable of doing that willingly, I don't want to enable it.

If my father ever prioritizes anything, be it a girlfriend or an event, over a commitment he made to my son again, I will stop inviting him. Same goes for any children my husband and I have in the future. I've informed my father of that, and he agreed.

His girlfriend, from what I've heard, is pissed at me, but I could care less.

This will be my only update. I don't think I have anything else to add, but feel free to ask me any questions you may have. Thank you for your feedback on my last post.",UPDATE,2024-10-14,"UPDATE - AITA for telling my father that it was his fault he missed my son's first birthday party? Hey guys.

1,1g3p3br,AITA for not leaving work early because my boyfriend has a cold? ,"My boyfriend and I are a heterosexual couple both in our 30s. I'm a corporate lawyer, currently gunning for partner in my firm, so I've been working insanely long hours. I'm sure some of you can imagine what this entails... my boyfriend works too but with my job I'm definitely the breadwinner. Overall he's been very supportive of my career. 

A few days ago, he caught a cold. He has a sore throat and a runny nose and feels lethargic. But like most men, he's been very dramatic about how sick he is. Even though he doesn't even have a fever, he's been dramatically talking about how he's ""dying"" for exaggeration. At first it was cute and amusing and obviously I don't mind taking care of him. On Saturday I worked all afternoon, and then made him soup to soothe his throat. I've also gone to the pharmacy to get medication for him and have been bringing him his tea, water, meds, etc for the last few days. 

But today it suddenly got too much. He woke me up at 4am complaining about how his throat is really sore. I got up and went to get him meds and water, but then he proceeded to stay on his phone with a bright light, giggling at memes he was looking at online, and keeping me awake too. I snapped and asked him to put his phone away so that I could sleep, because I had a long work day ahead of me, and he mumbled something about how unfair I'm being since he can't sleep because of his sore throat, but ultimately put the phone away. 

Then he was texting me all day while I was at work about how he's miserable, throat hurts, no fever, sniffles, updating me on everything. I kept replying telling him I'm sorry and just to drink water, take his meds, stay in bed, the regular stuff. At around 4pm he asked if I could leave work early and get him some snacks and cough medicine on the way home. I said I'm so sorry, I can't, I have been staying in the office until at least 8-9pm each day. This is a really crucial moment in my career that I've been working for since I started law school, and I just couldn't justify leaving early for this. Or sabotaging this moment in any way. 

He got upset and was mad at me when I got home. He said he had to put on his coat and go to the pharmacy on his own while ill (we live in a city, the pharmacy is literally 3 minute walk away) and it might've made him sicker. He said this incident makes him think I put my career wouldn't be there for him if there had been a medical emergency. I said I would absolutely leave work if it was a genuine medical emergency, but he has... a cold. He's still mad at me.

2,1g3owke,AITAH for being mad over pizza? ,"This may seem silly but it’s become a thing over the past few days. I 28f and my bf 24m have his friend over every Sunday to watch football during the season. On those days we usually just grab a few shitty frozen pizzas. Technically enough for one pizza each. However I never eat a whole one (when we have a ton of snacks prior). 

Last Sunday they each ate their whole pizzas, I had two slices of mine. I let them know I’d really only want two more pieces and they could have the rest. This is there the situation turns. 

My bf took two big slices. His friend took a big and a small to be considerate. He encouraged his friend to put the small one back and take the bigger one, leaving me the two smallest ones. He thinks I’m overreacting and have no right to be mad. And that if I was going to be that upset by it I should’ve just came out to pick out my slices. I told him that was really inconsiderate considering they had already eaten a whole entire pizza each, and even more inconsiderate that he went out of his way and told his friend to swap out the pieces after he already took what he wanted. 

Please note I’m not so much upset about the pizza as I am the fact that his friend was trying to be mindful and he went out of his way to tell him to do the opposite. We have been together about 2 1/2 years now. I guess I was just hoping for him to see that was he did was in poor taste. I have asked other people about this that agree with me but because it’s people in my circle he thinks it’s bias. And when I brought up asking other people about it, he wanted to just leave it at leaving me two pieces with no other details of I were to. So I’m turning to you lovely folks.

4,1g3o5e4,AITA for telling my roommates they make me uncomfortable?,"Throwaway account because everyone involved uses Reddit. I’m male mid 20s living with 2 girls I’ve known since high school, one is a close friend of mine and the other is her best friend.

She comes over pretty often and they are all close and go out together sometimes and watch movies and stuff. 

The problem is both of them are wayyyy to comfortable around me, walking around half naked, coming in while I’m showering to ask me stuff, they sit on the couch wearing only a t shirt sometimes and I think bare ass on the couch is gross. I could go on. I also don’t think I’m a clean freak but I definitely like to have things around the house neat and organized and both of them are pretty messy.

8,1g3nn0m,AITA for wanting my roommate to pay for my parking ticket?,"I (20 F) live with 3 other roommates (also 20 F) in the apartments on our college campus. If you’ve ever lived on campus, then you know there are many rules and is very different than living in a regular apartment. 

There is a parking lot right next to our room, but that is the schools commuter lot. You have to have a specific pass to be able to park there. My cars parking lot is MAX a 4 minute walk to the parking garage across the street. 

I have become the friend that always drives and pays for things because my parents give me money each month. I was happy to do it for awhile until my friends EXPECTED me to pay for things that were not my responsibility. I would gladly always get us Uber’s, DoorDash, or little things. But then it turned into any alcohol or groceries I bought was suddenly “for everyone”. There are many other examples, but overall, I was getting taken advantage of. So, I decided to stop paying for things. They did not take it well, but anyway. 

My roommate (who was my best friend at the time) was at her boyfriends house for a party. She called me and begged me to bring our foldable table because they needed it. She said I could stay and hangout aswell. I wasn’t doing anything, so I said I would. Then, I realized I couldn’t bring a full table in an Uber, so respectfully declined.

But then it turned into any alcohol or groceries I bought was suddenly “for everyone”. There are many other examples, but overall, I was getting taken advantage of. So, I decided to stop paying for things. They did not take it well, but anyway.

10,1g3ndds,AITA for telling my housemate not to have his girlfriend over?,"So just over a year ago I (26m) signed a lease with my ex girlfriend for an unfurnished house but it didn't work out so I asked a friend from my hometown (27m) if he'd like to take the extra room. He had mentioned he wanted to leave our hometown and a few of our shared friends lived nearby. The spare room had an office, and he worked from home so it seemed perfect.
 
At the time him and his girlfriend (24) were doing long distance until she also found a place to live nearby. She was staying at the house for 5-7 days a week but he also stayed with her so it all balanced out. When she moved to the city, I started to notice that they hadn't stayed at her place at all since she moved. It turns out, she had signed up for a huge house share with 8 other people.

A few weeks go by and her stays get longer and longer, sometimes lasting up to three weeks of being at the house constantly. His girlfriend also works from home and would use the shared spaces to work from. She did not contribute to bills, rent, resources we shared or even clean up after herself. There was a time where I had to pick up her used period pads from the bathroom floor after two days of them being there. The queue for the shower in the morning was always ridiculous and she would frequently take long baths in our shared bathroom during inconvenient times.

Eventually, I confronted my housemate and explained that it felt like I was living with a couple and that it was their house not ours, and that it had become overwhelming. Also, any time I tried to join them in the living room or ask if I could jump on my own playstation, it was clear I was not welcome.

I suggested a weekly cap, proposing four nights a week so that they can still enjoy most of the week at the house but I got some time to recharge and have some privacy too. I also explained that the way we were living felt like half the space, twice the mess and that they both needed to take responsibility for their mess in the house. He agreed and seemed to understand, so it had been good for us to reach a compromise.

The four nights cap lasted about a couple weeks and soon, his girlfriend was living with us yet again. I spoke to my housemate and explained that I needed him to take the four day cap more seriously. He said he understood but a couple weeks later, told me that he will be moving out and into a flat with his girlfriend. I said that I agreed, they should be living together and not in a houseshare and that I supported his decision. 

Since they moved out, I've heard from mutual friends that he has told them that I said his girlfriend wasn't welcome at all and branded me jealous during multiple and excessive discussions about it all. I asked him if he felt that way and he explained that he did, and that he wished all three of us could've lived there together.

He crashed his car years ago and because of that she refuses to help me or my twin get our first vehicle so we still don't have a fucking car. Me and my brother can't even leave the house without her asking us where we are going, why we are leaving, are we going to be using drugs.. Years ago I tried family therapy with my mother there  for one of these therapists. She proceeds to complain about how our grades suck for 15 minutes.

After trying multiple different therapists nothing really changed. The #1 stressor in my life has without a doubt been my mother. She gave me and my twin brother absolute hell over grades. It was literally everyday. So we both became depressed of course. We graduated and nothing got better it actually got worse. As we searched for jobs she proceeded to call us freeloading losers every single day until we found dead end retail jobs. Then COMPLAINED that we couldn't find something better than retail. Nothing has been good enough for her to stop screaming at us. What made our relationship really bad was when she figured out we smoke marijuana. Now she labels us as drug addicts.

Yesterday was my birthday, and I celebrated it with my partner's family since I'm not in contact with mine. I have never had a problem with his family before, so this threw me out of left field with how odd it all was. 

My partner's family is very religious - this has never been a problem until now. A month or so before my birthday was my partner's, and he celebrated by inviting his family and I out for dinner. Somehow, the topic of religion came up and before I knew it, his mother was asking what church I go to. I told her I don't go to church because I'm not the religious type, and during the dinner she didn't react very negatively at that. She just said ""Oh"" and changed topics. 

A week after that, my partner's mom called and asked me if I wanted to go to church with her the coming sunday, and I told her no thank you because I was busy. Honestly, I would have gone if I did have the time - I like socializing, and I know that religion is a big part of her so I wanted to at least show her that I respect that. I work every day of the week so there was no way I'd be able to make it, though. I thought this was understandable and that was that, so I gave it no more thought.

Normally, I don't get presents for my birthday - I'm usually the one giving them, and I've always been okay with that. My partner usually just takes me out for a birthday dinner because he knows I'm not one for material objects since I cherish memories a lot more. So, when my partner's mom handed me a bag with colorful paper in it, I was a little confused. No one else had brought anything, mostly because I told them I didn't expect anything, so I wasn't quite sure how to react when she eagerly handed it to me. 

I accepted it, gave her a hug and thanked her. She wanted me to open it right then and there, so I did - she gifted me a gorgeously decorated bible. It had a leather cover with little embroideries, which were gorgeous. I told her just that, and she seemed happy with that response.   
last night, however, she had called my partner to ask him if I had read the bible at all since I got it. I hadn't, but I did display it on a mantle because I thought it was pretty - and he told her that. Apparently, she got upset and told him that I didn't appreciate the gift that she put so much time into. He tried to tell her that I did appreciate it, but it was just going in one ear and out the other.

Yesterday was my birthday, and I celebrated it with my partner's family since I'm not in contact with mine. I have never had a problem with his family before, so this threw me out of left field with how odd it all was. 

My partner's family is very religious - this has never been a problem until now. A month or so before my birthday was my partner's, and he celebrated by inviting his family and I out for dinner. Somehow, the topic of religion came up and before I knew it, his mother was asking what church I go to.

Unfortunately, he changed his return flight for an event and will now arrive back on my birthday.

I expressed my disappointment, as I was looking forward to spending my birthday together. While I always go the extra mile for his birthdays, he tends to keep things simple for me, which I respect, but I really value celebrating my day with him. 

Today, he mentioned that I shouldn't be disappointed because we get to spend half of my birthday together because his flight arrives in the afternoon. He plans to pick up his son from his mom and then come to me for the evening. I mentioned that although I don't have any concrete plans yet, I might prefer to celebrate just the two of us—without kids. He responded by saying I need to understand that by that time he hasn't seen his son in two weeks and that his son is his priority. He also reminded me that I accepted this “package” when we started dating and feels that I'm making a big deal out of wanting to spend the day alone with him.

19,1g3kp3l,AITA for making my sister pay me back for throwing out my daughter's bra?,"Right now, we're hosting my sister and her family because their home was damaged by Hurricane Helene.

There are some rules in place: be respectful of our living space, her sons are not allowed in my daughter Thea's room,and as soon as the repairs are done, they are out of here.

Her sons broke one of the rules when they went in Thea's room and went through her things. They found one of Thea's special compression bras. Thea has been doing theater ever since she was little. The compression bra looks like a tank top and she uses it if she is playing a boy or a young girl and has to flatten her chest to better look the part.

Their mom found it and threw it away.

We didn't realize this until Thea was packing her theater bag for play practice and realized it was missing. This is not great because she's starring as Viola in her school's production of ""Twelfth Night.""   

Thea buys most of her theater stuff like makeup and costumes and the bra was pretty expensive, $50. 

I told my sister she needed to pay us back so we can replace it.  My sister refuses because she says she isn't doing well financially and how dare I demand a homeless woman pay for her boys being boys. Not to mention, she doesn't think it's appropriate for her to have something like that.

Our mom, who has always been soft on Judy, thinks we're being too harsh since she's a single mom who doesn't have a home right now.  I just want my daughter's stuff replaced, is that too much to ask? AITA?

Edit: To answer some frequently asked questions:

-Why won't my mom take them in? She lives in a retirement community that doesn't allow anyone under the age of 65. I'm not sure if temporary stays are ok, but if she let them live with her then she runs the risk of getting evicted.

-I don't know how much damage was done to the bra itself. Thea's room was pretty trashed. We're talking clothes left on the floor, spilled perfume, and messing with a display shelf full of some of her old Disney dolls. 

-All I know is that Judy saw the boys messing with the bra, thought it was another kind of breast binder, and threw it away. 

-We got locks installed for Thea's room, along with our son and my husband's ""man cave"" after we found out the boys messed with his stuff.

-Why did I let them in? I've hosted other family and friends during previous hurricanes and never ran into this problem, maybe someone's kids got into Thea's costumes but no harm no foul. I've always been raised to help others, especially family, in their time of need, but this has me wanting to set up boundaries now. 

-Judy and her kids are going to have to find a new place to stay. I'm just waiting for my hubby to come home from work. We may need one of his friends for backup just in case.

20,1g3kh99,AITA for asking my bf to talk to his bestie because she’s touchy with him,"I (20F) have had a boyfriend (20M) for 4 months.
He has a bff (20F) and no before you say anything that’s not the issue here, they basically grew up together and it’s totally okay with me that he has a bff (I have male bffs too) 

A few things for context:  she recently broke up with her boyfriend and since then she’s been looking for someone new and she’s been … hungry …  (I became very close friend with her I acc love her she’s very cute)

The thing is, she often (like- everytime we’re together) makes jokes about her being in love with my bf .. and it’s been making me and my bf very uncomfortable bc we just don’t know what to say about that like idk it’s the kind of jokes that make everybody go silent you know ?

Also, to me, she’s very touchy with my bf and I’m uncomfortable with that. Not bc I don’t trust him or her (I mean I trust him more than her but I guess that’s normal) but mostly bc I think this is a bit disrespectful to me .. For instance : she touches his chest while taking to him, or rubs his shoulders or his stomach

I talked about it with my bf and he listened and heard me and said he would talk to her if it made me uncomfortable but he told me he didn’t notice anything so I’m guessing she’s always been like that with him? 

It’s hard to be in that position bc on the one hand I’ve know them both for 4months and she was there before me and I don’t want to be the kind of gf that creates problems with friends or forces 2 bff to stop being the way they were before me. But on the other hand d I noticed I am tense every time she approaches him and I can’t handle seeing them like that as much as I know I trust him a lot I just don’t like another woman (bff or not) being like that with him.

So, am I the A-hole for wanting my bf to talk to her and risk creating tension / awkwardness between all of us ?

21,1g3k7zm,AITA for asking money back from my friend?,"Me (M22) and this friend (M20) have developed a close friendship for around 8 months at university from playing basketball together. He’s from a different province so he rents here with his girlfriend at the time near campus while I live with my parents which is an hour drive from campus. He lives off his loans and doesn’t work. Because of that I try being a good friend and offering him to dinner events for food, my house for food and helped him with course work at school etc. and I’ll be the one driving. One week he broke up with his girlfriend so he was pretty much homeless and had to stay at his other friend’s dorm till he found his own place and he asked me for $20 for food. I gave it to him and said “no worries just pay me back when you got the money”. 

So whenever we go out together with our friend group I know that he doesn’t have funds to be going out like that so I always offer to cover/split with him. We split a $30 bottle of liquor when going clubbing which was $15 that he’s not paying back. Everything added up being $100CAD overall that I paid for him. But the one event that is bothering me the most was when our friend group went out together to a hot pot restaurant where the amount you pay depends on the weight of your own individual bowl that you put the food in yourself. I offered to pay for him when we got there. But when everyone’s average price was around $20CAD, my friend ended up getting a bowl of food that was $40CAD. 

So my questions is if someone offered to pay for your food, would you go crazy and order whatever on the menu or would you hold back and be lenient knowing it’s not coming out of your wallet? While we line up to pay I said it’s fine I’ll cover for you because our other friends were around and I didn’t want to seem like I back out after seeing the price of the food that I won’t be eating, but also knowing this friend cannot afford a $40 plate of food. At the same night he was straight disrespecting and talking shit to me at the table in front of our friends. A few days later I decided to ask him to pay me back for the $20 that he begged and requested from me for food and for the $40 that he went crazy on knowing it wasn’t his money, so $60 total. I didn’t even mind that he owes me another $40 for all the stuff I got for him and that I wasn’t asking money back for the bottle of liquor etc. His excuses were saying how I’m petty because he hurt my ego that night, how he doesn’t have the funds (tells me he has $35 in his bank account but I’m like how do u afford food then) but when he has the funds from his minimum wage job he’ll pay me back, how he has helped me with other stuff which were free, and he promised he’ll pay be back during August.

24,1g3jr3v,AITA for refusing to buy bananas anymore because the kids and my husband will only eat them if they are still green?,"I do grocery shopping weekly for my family and enjoy it, so this isn’t about that. I’ll buy bananas and they just end up rotting away. My husband and kids will only eat bananas if they are still somewhat green. I am not so picky, so I end up eating the rest of them.

But sometimes I want the 120 calories for something else that day. And there’s only so much banana bread we can eat or space in the freezer.

So I stopped buying bananas. Of course immediately they noticed and complained. I told them I’m not going to buy them just for them to go bad. They are upset because they have one less option. But my daughter said I’m being too uptight and that it’s not the end of the world if bananas go bad. I hate wasting food. 

AITA here? Am I really depriving them of that much by having one less snack option for them? 

Right now as options for snacks, they have: apples, peanut butter, several types of cheese, nuts (pistachios, almonds, peanuts, sunflower seeds), tortilla chips and salsa, homemade protein bars, popcorn, pretzels and hummus. Plus they can always make sandwiches, and there are frozen homemade burritos and breakfast burritos. To me, this is so much. 

**Okay clearly I did not explain this well enough, which is on me. Yes, I have tried to buy fewer bananas. It didn't work. They would still often not even eat a single banana.

25,1g3jq4i,AITA for not walking my gf dog in the morning ,"So to give some background, my girlfriend and I have been dating for almost a year. She got a dog about 3 months ago. Recently (like past month) she has been asking me to walk her once or twice a week in the morning when she’s running late to work. She works from home a couple days a week and every week she’ll go in on the other days and every 1 to 2 days she’s required to be at her work location that’s 30 minutes away and she needs to get there at 8. Sometimes she’ll get lucky and gets to work at a different work location that’s closer. Because of this she needs to get up at 7:00 at the latest to walk the dog. On those days where she’s running late is when she’ll ask me to walk her. 
I told her I didn’t want a dog. I have an extremely skiddish cat (who just started not hiding from the dog) which I was worried about. My asthma is also incredibly bad and since having the dog I’ve had to switch from a rescue inhaler that I used once every 3 months if even that, to a daily inhaler morning and night and it still doesn’t help. It’s like there’s pressure on my chest every second when I’m home. I also told her I wasn’t going to walk the dog. I made that incredibly clear. 
When I finally put my foot down and said “this is your dog that you wanted to have and I made it clear I don’t want to walk her in the morning and it’s your responsibility” she started talking about how she does things for my cat like she brushes her and plays with her, though I don’t think this is a comparison. You’re asking me to walk the dog in the morning when I’m getting ready for work. I shouldn’t have to prolong when I get to work because you can’t take responsibility. 
I do walk the dog when I’m back from work. I work 8-4:30 M-F and I take her to the dog park here and there and play with her, but I like my sleep. 
She was especially upset this morning because she said I was snoring and she got no sleep which is why she was pushing that this was something I should do. On other days she has asked me though, there was no reasoning other than the fact she woke up late or didn’t get ready in time. Her whole thing also is that I’m her partner and I should want to help and pitch in even when it’s not my dog, because I should care enough. And I do kind of get that, but again I really really enjoy my sleep. Im also not a complete lazy POS either and refuse to do anything. I walk her after work and play with her and I even walk her at night ever so often when she’s not feeling good. Mornings just don’t work for me. I’m not sure how else to say this so she gets my side. I’m waiting to send her a text or a call soon because she stormed out really upset. 
Also to talk about her a little more, she’s not lazy. She takes the dog to the dog park for an hour every day when I don’t take her and whenever she gets walked in the morning and night it’s a good 30 minute walk at least. The dog is very active. I think she also obviously struggles with getting up really early too.

26,1g3j6pg,AITA for having a birthday party without my birth family?,"I (16m) was adopted and my birth parents chose an open adoption because they wanted to know about me and see me sometimes. My parents were very willing to do that. They had an open adoption with my sister Mylee (19f) and always wanted to allow us to have connections to our birth families.  For the first 7ish years the open adoption meant a phone call once a year and one visit with my parents sending updates to my birth family. Mylee had more contact with her birth family but in different ways. Our contact levels were always really different.

But after my birth parents got pregnant again when I was 7/8ish they wanted more contact and for me to know my ""siblings"". I say ""siblings"" because while I'm biologically related to their kids, my siblings to me are Mylee, Jamie (22m) and Kiara (24). Jamie and Kiara are my parents bio kids.

I never felt that close to my birth parents or birth siblings and I never really enjoyed spending time with them. If they had disappeared from my life it wouldn't have upset me. But over the last few years stuff got more complicated because my birth siblings started expressing a lot of jealousy of my siblings and being weirdly territorial with me. They'd try to get between me and my siblings when we'd sit together. They would ignore them other times if my siblings tried talking to them. We also had situations where they would scream and cry and want me to go home with them and my birth parents would try to pressure my parents to force me because my birth parents knew I didn't want to go. My birth parents blamed my parents for me not wanting to have sleepovers at their house and things like that. My parents never ended the open part of the adoption because they didn't want to be the people who came between their kids and their kids bio parents/families.

But with how old I am now, I talked to my parents and told them I wanted to end contact and didn't want to include them in my 16th birthday not too long ago. They understood and agreed they would respect my decision. Turns out my birth mother had another FB account with a different name and she was FB friends with mom on that too. She saw photos from my birthday party and then confronted me over it on social media. She told me my ""real siblings"" would be so crushed to be cut out of my life like this and how much they adore me and how they would have loved my 16th birthday party.

Context: 

My (m34) mother (late 60s) is and has always been a very critical person, and says things that are offensive and hurtful often. When confronted or given feedback, she defaults to “sorry you don’t think I’m a good mother” or something to that effect or “I am hurt you think that was my intention”. 

When she was in the car with my wife to come and pick me up from my surgery, she told my wife that I was “blowing things out of proportion” by being stressed about this surgery. 

Our mother regularly criticizes my sister and I to each other, though I have been rebuffing what she says about my sister, essentially telling her to “talk to her about it”. 

The situation: 

My sister (f29) came to see me yesterday; I’ve been recovering from a major surgery and am just about 5 weeks post op, and improving slowly - but still not really able to get around much, and dealing with unpleasant symptoms etc. The visit was nice, and she mentioned that I had come up in conversation, and our mum had been telling her that my recovery “isn’t that difficult” as she had a similar surgery decades ago. What my sister communicated was that mum was essentially being like “he needs to be getting around more, it’s not that hard”. Meanwhile, I have been telling my family what I’m going through, and how it has resulted in me being at my lowest as far as mental health, and finding the overall recovery traumatizing.

It upset me to hear that my mum is essentially telling my sister that I am overreacting or in some way over exaggerating my experience, especially by gossiping about it. She has done this in the past by saying things like “god he’s gained weight” and other critical things. 

I gave it some thought, and after sleeping on it, I sent the following to my mother: 

“[Sister] mentioned to me that you had been saying my recovery “isn’t that difficult” and i found that to be pretty hurtful :( 

I realize that you had your surgery and your experience, but I think insinuating that I’m not having a difficult time or legitimately struggling isn’t a nice thing to say about me. 

I don’t really want to discuss it, honestly, but wanted to let you know that hearing that was hurtful.” 

She responded with:

“Sorry that you are hurt.. I think that this is not how I ever spoke about you, or your recovery. I am shocked and surprised that 1) [Sister] has insinuated that and 2) that you don’t believe that I always have good intentions and much love and support for you.“

I expected this, and to me it feels the same as always. I didn’t mean it that way and I’m upset you think I did. 

Now, my sister is messaging me, asking why I couldn’t “leave her out of it” as now mum is messaging her. “This just serves to punish me for telling you” is what she just sent me. 

At this point I’ve just told sister to keep this to herself in the future. I don’t want to hear what my mum complains to her about regarding me, if everyone is going to get mad when I try to tell them that I’ve been upset by it. 

What would you do? AITA here?

My (m34) mother (late 60s) is and has always been a very critical person, and says things that are offensive and hurtful often. When confronted or given feedback, she defaults to “sorry you don’t think I’m a good mother” or something to that effect or “I am hurt you think that was my intention”. 

When she was in the car with my wife to come and pick me up from my surgery, she told my wife that I was “blowing things out of proportion” by being stressed about this surgery. 

Our mother regularly criticizes my sister and I to each other, though I have been rebuffing what she says about my sister, essentially telling her to “talk to her about it”. 

The situation: 

My sister (f29) came to see me yesterday; I’ve been recovering from a major surgery and am just about 5 weeks post op, and improving slowly - but still not really able to get around much, and dealing with unpleasant symptoms etc. The visit was nice, and she mentioned that I had come up in conversation, and our mum had been telling her that my recovery “isn’t that difficult” as she had a similar surgery decades ago. What my sister communicated was that mum was essentially being like “he needs to be getting around more, it’s not that hard”. Meanwhile, I have been telling my family what I’m going through, and how it has resulted in me being at my lowest as far as mental health, and finding the overall recovery traumatizing.

It upset me to hear that my mum is essentially telling my sister that I am overreacting or in some way over exaggerating my experience, especially by gossiping about it. She has done this in the past by saying things like “god he’s gained weight” and other critical things. 

I gave it some thought, and after sleeping on it, I sent the following to my mother: 

“[Sister] mentioned to me that you had been saying my recovery “isn’t that difficult” and i found that to be pretty hurtful :( 

I realize that you had your surgery and your experience, but I think insinuating that I’m not having a difficult time or legitimately struggling isn’t a nice thing to say about me. 

I don’t really want to discuss it, honestly, but wanted to let you know that hearing that was hurtful.” 

She responded with:

“Sorry that you are hurt.. I think that this is not how I ever spoke about you, or your recovery. I am shocked and surprised that 1) [Sister] has insinuated that and 2) that you don’t believe that I always have good intentions and much love and support for you.“

I expected this, and to me it feels the same as always. I didn’t mean it that way and I’m upset you think I did. 

Now, my sister is messaging me, asking why I couldn’t “leave her out of it” as now mum is messaging her. “This just serves to punish me for telling you” is what she just sent me. 

At this point I’ve just told sister to keep this to herself in the future. I don’t want to hear what my mum complains to her about regarding me, if everyone is going to get mad when I try to tell them that I’ve been upset by it. 

What would you do? AITA here?

31,1g3ioxj,AITAH for telling my friends they weren't good ones?,"I have been in my friend group of 5 for a majority of highschool (six including me). The friend group consists of four girls in my grade + plus another in the grade above us and me. I have always felt like I was the outcast in the friend group and how specifically since there were five of us In our class,there were always a duo while I was left out. Planned were getting made infront of my for sleepovers and yet I was never invited. They would show pictures to me they took when they were all together and I wasn't with them. When I tried to create plans,they never wanted to do them, they would have separate groupchats without me in them, I would always wish them a happy birthday and get them gifts but never got anything back(that doesn't bother me) and was never told happy birthday back- etc. I brought this issue up a couple of times saying I felt left out and their response was they were going to change and were sorry. 

Two situation that really got me upset was when a person in our friend group had a birthday coming up and plans were being made  and were talking about it at lunch.Once again left out until the birthday girl asked if I was going and the whole table got silent until one of the girls said how they didn't think I wanted to go but invited me anyways and I was extremely happy and was excited to go- until a couple hours later that night I got a message saying only one vehicle could be taken and everyone else can fit in it but there wasn't enough room for me and I couldn't help but think maybe that was a lie to stop me from going. Another situation was when I was activity helping with a birthday party for our friend and I was suggesting the place we should go to,the daym etc and was shocked to find out a girl in our friend group thought I was wasn't going to go and it would be just them.

When I said again I felt left out, I was told I was overreacting. One of my final straws was when a new girl joined our friend group and I really liked her but what made me upset was how my friend group was treating her and how they let her into the group chat they had without me(when I asked to be in it,they said they just liked it with them and didn't want to add anyone else) and they always made plan and hung out her and a part of me felt jealous but I never stopped being nice to them.

I was,for the last time, telling my friends how I felt but they got all defensive saying how they all treated me very good and I had no right to feel the way I did and that they were great friends and if I think I can do better,go get new ones because there aren't going to be any. At that moment, I think I had enough and told them(respectfully) how they weren't good friends for continuously leaving another friend out and making them feel like they are unappreciated like the rest are and they weren't good friends for lying to me about plans and their response was they didn't know and I didn't have to be rude.

He is the kind of boyfriend who will not accompany me when we hang out with my friends, despite being invited by them, and he rarely socializes with my family. However, he does provide for my needs, including financial support. We rarely go on dates because he always reasons that he is tired or that it is a waste of money, suggesting we should just eat at home and have food delivered.

Whenever I invite him to go with me, he declines and rarely agrees to it. So, whenever he invites me, I always say yes and take the chance to go with him since it is very rare for him to do so.

Recently, he invited me to spend this coming New Year with him and his friends in Baguio. I immediately said yes because I want to be with him, and it is very rare for him to invite me. Everything was already paid for, including the flight tickets and tour. However, I decided to cancel because when I invited him to watch a certain movie, he said that he would watch it with his friends and that they had already bought tickets. I thought to myself, did he even think of me when they decided to watch the movie? Because when I saw who he was watching with, I noticed the names of his friends' girlfriends, and it made me realize that he never even thinks about me.

33,1g3hjw4,AITA for not getting a new job so that I can take care of my sister since my mom works on weekends,"Sorry for the complicated title. My mom works a lot and she doesn’t trust daycare centres so I (16m) am responsible for my younger sister (4) most of the time. I pick her up from kindergarten, I make her breakfast lunch and dinner, play with her and do everything else. I pay for her toys and other miscellaneous stuff but not food and basic needs. I didnt mind much though as I had weekends free because my mom takes care of her.

I work on weekends because I don’t have allowance and wld rather pay for stuff on my own. I can work whenever I want as long as I clock in the sufficient hours. I just work all my hours on the weekends. 

My mom recently told me she wants to switch her hours so that she works on saturdays and sundays instead of mondays and tuesdays because it ends earlier. I said that’s a bad idea since I have my sister on weekdays and I have to work on weekends so if she switches to weekends then nobody can take care of my sister. She said I should move my hours cuz my boss is more flexible than hers. But I can’t just do that because the shop I work at probably won’t let kids in and my sister can’t stay there for long before I get into trouble. My job doesn’t let me do mondays and tuesdays days since the shifts are booked up. So I can’t just move it around like that. Also, on weekdays I can only work a shorter amount of time so if I wanted to make up for the total hours I would work if I gave up my weekend shift I would have to do 3 or 4 days on weekdays. 

She was angry but dropped it and I thought that was it. But a few days ago she suddenly announced that she already moved her hours and it’s not up for debate. This is really inconvenient because nobody is free to look after my sister on weekends. We fought and she told me I’ll just have to find another job. Which really sucks since I liked the environment.

So I argued with her and she said since she’s the main contributor in the household she has the first say on what happens. I said I wouldn’t change my job and she basically pointed out that im being selfish since I just want the money for myself and the money she makes is for the sake of the household. On one hand I think moving her hours just so she can end earlier is not really fair but I can see her point of view on the household expense part. So AITA

34,1g3gwq6,AITA for calling my friends mother while she was on a date?,"Hi everyone.

  
So here's what happened. I (25F) have been friends with S (21F) for about 3 years. S is a very closed off person who rather spends time by herself and is inside a lot of the time. She doesn't have a lot of friends and never had a boyfriend or something. Very closed off emotionally.

The thing is, S has major daddy issues. Less than a month ago, she met a guy online who is 45. They started chatting, and I was skeptical because of his age as first. She got mad at me for it, and I apologized and said I'd love to hear how the date went and that I was glad they were having fun. Then the date comes, and she only then reveals to me they are meeting at a hotel at 10pm, and that he booked a hotel room for them and they were gonna have drinks. MAJOR red flag if you ask me. She has no experience and has talked about this with him, but instead of taking things slow or even meeting in a public place at broad daylight, he 'treats' her to a 'romantic night'. I didn't say anything because she always gets angry when you question her decisions. I thought it was a pretty red flag to have your first date at a hotel and consume alcohol, instead of having a date in broad daylight to really see each other in person for the first time.

That night a mutual friend came to me, saying how worried she was. I was glad someone else was worried, because I felt like I was the only one being a spoil sport and questioning this man's morals.. I also explained to my dad what was going on and how worried I was, and he said that it's probably smart to let at least her mother know, so she would know what was going on. Me and the mutual friend decided to call the mother because we were worried sick (she wasn't replying either), turns out the mother did know and was okay with it.

Next day she tells us everything went great, and didn't share a lot overall but she seemed to be on a big pink cloud (from the start, but still after the date). However that is also when she got extremely angry at me, saying I told her mother and was poking my nose in her business 'for my own gains', that she trusts him so I should trust her decisions too, and that she was generally very unhappy with me because he would never do such things. She also said 'what does this say about you that you're so worried about me?'. I explained to her that it just seemed really wrong to me (and her other friends and family too), that she would meet for the first time with a man twice her age, at a hotel and drink alcohol to then proceed to have sex, and tried to make her see from our point of view why we were all worried. Her mother as well as her sisters were worried sick. However she only got mad at me because I made the decision to ask her mother if she was aware.

I didn't say anything to that which apparently got her angry.

He has ADHD, is married, and had two daughters. I hired him in my small business which is an office setting many years ago to give him a job for his family. 

I have trained him, given him ample opportunity to be successful, and allowed him to hire multiple members of his wife's family and friends. I am still keeping the business afloat for him financially and his wife works a well paying full time job. They bought almost a million dollar house this year and spend money rapidly like putting their kids in multiple travel sports which cost several thousand a year. I am not one to tell them how to spend their money but I'm providing context for the story.

He started yelling and swearing at me this past week and told me I'm spending too much from the business with my wife and our new home. I hired some contractors to paint and put in new floors. He told me he was only giving me $9,000 of a $36,000 payment I am owed. My wife and I are on a fixed income. 

I told him to get out and he had a big outburst swearing, carrying on, and stressing me out. He doesn't even do his job and I am always doing the brunt of the work. I have decided to take my business back and all my clients and work on my own. He can figure the rest out himself. I'm tired of his lack of commitment. 

His wife and him have also alienated my other children and family due to their awful drama and bullying tactics. They didn't attend a family event over the weekend we had and honestly it was the most fun I've had in a long time. My younger son and daughter both refuse to be around this son and wife due to how awful they have treated them. My daughter hasn't attended a holiday in two years because of this son and his wife and she finally came this past weekend and we had a great time.

AITA to cut my son out of my business? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-14,"AITA for wanting my son to give me back the family business he can’t take over?  I 74M have a son who is 47M who got arrested for a DUI over 15 years ago and he is unable to find a regular job. He has ADHD, is married, and had two daughters. I hired him in my small business which is an office setting many years ago to give him a job for his family. 

I have trained him, given him ample opportunity to be successful, and allowed him to hire multiple members of his wife's family and friends. I am still keeping the business afloat for him financially and his wife works a well paying full time job. They bought almost a million dollar house this year and spend money rapidly like putting their kids in multiple travel sports which cost several thousand a year. I am not one to tell them how to spend their money but I'm providing context for the story.

38,1g3g7cx,WIBTA if I didn’t go to my friends wedding because she wants me to wear white but her fiancée doesn’t?,"WIBTA means would I be the asshole by the way.

Okay so me and my best friend, Poetry, have been best friends since like 3rd or 4th grade now and we are in our 20s/30s 
And we been through thick and thin and we got into a lot of trouble so just imagine how much we mean to each other.

And I don’t know if it’s official but I don’t think her fiancée, Sam, likes me. I mean she asks me if I want to go a their dates sometimes and I say no because they deserve alone time together in and outside of where they live, but I do say yes when it’s a group hangout or someone else is with them.

 So after a few hours after the proposal* Poetry called me and was asking if I could come and I obviously said of course. And she was doing all the planning and all that and all that time later she asked me if I wanted to wear white or red (she’s indian)

I was questioning it because the rule in a lot of places is the bride wears a certain color the guests and bridesmaids don’t? And I was most definitely going to get some looks even if I do explain I had permission to wear this color.

And I guess there was some fight with her fiancée because he doesn’t want me to wear white to their wedding and I definitely understand that. I don’t really want drama so I said I’ll just wear what all the other bridesmaids are wearing or I could wear colors like the groomsmen if that was cool. And Poetry was saying that her accomplishments are mine and all that. The wedding is in a few weeks and I’m really not trying to get her future husband not to like me and not to be in their life, and I don’t want to be a possible chance to ruin their relationship at all.

39,1g3g4yl,AITA for being angry that the person who rescued the dog I traveled halfway around the world to adopt now wants the dog back?,"A few months ago, a friend of mine asked for help rehoming a dog she rescued while volunteering in Asia. I agreed to take the dog as I’d just lost one of my own and wanted to provide a home for another in need. I flew to Asia and brought the dog back to Europe because regulations state that pet dogs can only enter the country if accompanied by their owner. ETA: my friend did pay for my return flight.

Once here, my friend (who lives elsewhere in Europe) asked to come and stay for a week to help the dog adjust. I agreed, thinking it would be helpful. But after a few days, she suddenly told me she’s realized how attached she is, has had a change of heart, and wants to keep the dog herself. She’s asking me to transfer ownership so she can fly the dog back to her own country, even though the dog is legally mine, and I’ve already spent a ton of time, effort, and money getting her here.

This is especially frustrating because, before I flew to get the dog, I asked my friend is she was 100% sure she didn't just want to keep the dog herself, but she explicitly said she couldn’t take her due to financial instability, traveling often, and having other pets. Now she’s changed her mind and claims she’s the dog’s ""soulmate,"" even though I’ve already made plans to integrate the dog into my home with my other pets.

I’m furious and feel used, like this whole process was a way for her to get the dog from Asia to Europe just so she could swoop in and try to cajole me into letting her claim the dog back. I told her she needs to prove she can provide a stable home, but I’m beyond frustrated at her behavior. If I were in her situation, I'd admit defeat and bow out gracefully rather than mess someone around like this.

My mom had tried to leave him several times. She was really sick and believed she couldn't start over. That no one else but him would love her as sick as she was. Mainly because that's what he repeatedly told her. She was an amazing woman who light was dimmed the longer they remained together. Despite all that we were extremely close. We were always together or on the phone with each other until he would come home from work. For reference sake, I am her next of kin. And her final wishes were followed as much as I could. With one exception, her ashes were never handed out to her family they way she wished and the remaining ashes were placed in an urn. My mom had an immense fear of being buried. It would lead her into a panic attack. I promised her that would never happen. (Side Note - My stepdad picked up her ashes from the funeral home before I could and refused to give them up. He even made my sister (mom's biological child) PAY to get enough ashes to put into a necklace. I think it was like $200)

Recently he passed away. His family hid that fact and didn't notify a single soul beyond their family. When I had asked about my mom's ashes I was informed she would be buried with him. I told them that wasn't their choice to make. They told me it wasn't mine either that it was his and this was what he wanted. My mom spent her entire life with him doing what he wanted. I can't help but feel like she wouldn't be a peace if she was to be buried against her wishes. My mom's family is understandably upset.

My aunt and I have both tried talking to them but they refuse to listen. 

Now as my mom's next of kin her family want me to send a cease and desist order for burying her remains.

She is 2 grades ahead of me and thus has been here longer than me. Before I came, my friend had a long term boyfriend (21M) that she cheated on with his best friend (21M).

Since I just got to the school about a year ago I didn't really know the details of everything just whatever my friend told me. None of them were on speaking terms with each other so I never thought I would get to meet them.

Fast forward a bit and I have also become friends with her ex boyfriend because we have similar interests. My friend was ok with this as he didn't really bother her that much. Then I started hanging out with the guy she had the affair with and she got a little upset.

She started hanging out with me less frequently and when we did hangout I would have to dance around the fact that I was friends with her exs or I would get an earful about how bad they are.

Since she hasn't been hanging with me I have been hanging with her ex lover because we have similar interests and he takes me on motorcycle rides. Sadly I am starting to fall for him a bit but that's another issue. He did also fill me in on his side of the story and I realized that my friend has been keeping a lot of details out to make herself seem more of a victim.

My wife and I switch off cooking, both of us cook twice a week and the days neither of us cook it’s a leftover night or takeout. We used to have the person that didn’t cook do the dishes after the meals. I clean as a cook, so when it is my night there are very few dishes for her to clean up. When she cooks, I swear she uses almost every single dish or pot for her meals. It is a disaster in the kitchen and takes me a long time to clean the whole thing up.

I have had conversations before about this and have asked her to clean as she goes to reduce then mess. She refuses and claims that is just what happens because she likes to make elaborate meals. She does make more elaborate meals than me and spends a while in the kitchen. I prefer to make more simples meals like stir fry. 

I brought up last thursday that I won’t clean up after her cooking anymore. She left a huge mess and I was over it. That I will clean up my dinners and she can clean up hers.

On Saturday ( my cooking night) I made beef tips over noddles and cleaned it all up.Sunday was her cooking night and she made homemade pasta and red pepper sauce. We ate and she didn’t clean up her mess, and later the night she asked me to clean it up I told her no and reminded her what I told her and pointed out I cleaned my stuff up.

43,1g3eell,AITA for cancelling plans for a trial run at my grandparents house?,"Two years ago CPS took me (15m) and my siblings (10f and 8m) from our parents and placed us with our maternal grandparents. I was being parentified and our parents did not provide us with enough. We all missed a lot of school because I was too overwhelmed and angry to get us all breakfast, ready for school and then to school each morning and some days I went to school alone and made my parents decide whether they took my siblings or not and other days I couldn't face going to school and I stayed home. There were days we ate nothing but potato chips because I couldn't find the energy to make better food or because we had nothing else in the house. Sometimes the house was all gross and stuff too because cleaning was at the bottom of my list of things to do.

I told my grandparents one day after I just broke and I was so done. My siblings really exhausted me that day. They didn't want to go to school and they screamed at me that we should stay home and do nothing. They wanted to snuggle with me all day and they wouldn't even let me go to the bathroom. So I dragged them to our grandparents and told them everything. It had been 4 years since they had seen us because my parents wanted to hide how much they forced me to do. They called CPS and they investigated and we were temporarily placed in the care of our grandparents.

Things got worse for a while after we were placed with our grandparents. My siblings didn't really remember them well or want them around so they would try to lock us into the room our grandparents gave me, they'd cling more and they were apparently really bad at school. I was struggling a lot mentally too. So the family got together and I ended up moving to my aunt and uncle's house (mom's sister and BIL). It was supposed to be a few nights with them and the other nights with my grandparents but my siblings did not want me to go when they'd know I was leaving and we decided it was better if I just stayed with my aunt and uncle.

I went to therapy, my siblings went to therapy, and we had therapy together. Therapy together was so tough that I did it via Zoom while they were in the room with the therapist because again, they didn't want me to go. We had to stop going to visit my grandparents house because they'd be so much worse if I stepped foot in the door. We could meet outside both houses a little easier but it wasn't easy. We were always meant to try and integrate me back in a bit more over time and trial some sleepovers at some point. But my siblings have said in our family therapy that once I come back I can't ever leave and stuff and how they miss me doing stuff for them. So almost two yeas later I said I didn't think we should do the trial next month like we'd talked about. The adults get it but my siblings are so angry and they called me mean and said I left them and I wasn't supposed to.

Me and my friend have been friends since year 5 and so we are very close, we hang out a lot and we sleepover at each other house every now and again. But ever since my mother has known my friends mother they have always hated each other (I don’t know why)

A couple of days ago I had a pretty bad trip at work (I work at a fast food restaurant) so there is a lot of heavy machinery, so i ended up tripping over some scrap metal when taking out the trash, I was ok but I did have a good chunk missing from my leg (not bad enough for stitches or leaving work early). I did go and find my manager and we got some things from the first aid kit, but because this happened mid lunch rash he couldn’t really stay and help me. 
So I ended up calling my friends mother because she is a registered nurse and I know she could help me and tell me what to do in this situation.
I ended up fixing myself all up with her help, thanked her and went back on shift.
When I got home I told my mother about it and showed her my leg and told her how I had to call my friends mother because my manager was busy, honestly I didn’t think it was a big deal, but my mother in the other hand blew up in my face yelling and accusing me of “trying to embarrass her” and making her out to be a “no good mother” (her words not mine) I tried telling her that it wasn’t my intention to make her feel like that and that my friends mother was a nurse and worked in the medical field so she knew what she was talking about. But my mother was having non of it, so after about 30 minutes of going back and forth about it I ended up going to my room for the rest of the night.
In the morning I got up and got ready for work and when I went down to the kitchen to get some breakfast and say “hello” to my mother but when I did she just ignored me, I thought she was still mad at me for last night. So I went to work not thinking much about it, but when I got home she was still ignoring me and after a while she started to make sly remarks about my friends mother and how I should “go live with her instead” and how “I should be she kid instead”. And I tried telling mother how she’s taking this too far and how it wasn’t that deep, but she still isn’t having any of this.

Me and my friend have been friends since year 5 and so we are very close, we hang out a lot and we sleepover at each other house every now and again. But ever since my mother has known my friends mother they have always hated each other (I don’t know why)

A couple of days ago I had a pretty bad trip at work (I work at a fast food restaurant) so there is a lot of heavy machinery, so i ended up tripping over some scrap metal when taking out the trash, I was ok but I did have a good chunk missing from my leg (not bad enough for stitches or leaving work early). I did go and find my manager and we got some things from the first aid kit, but because this happened mid lunch rash he couldn’t really stay and help me.

Her will states that her house is to be sold, and the money split between her grandchildren.

One of my cousin Claire is experiencing active addiction. Her youngest sibling Sam is now caring for 2 out of her 5 children, and attempting to get the other 3 children out of their separate foster homes.

Our parents gathered the grandchildren together and have said they want Sam to have Claire's share, to support the children.
No-one knows where Claire is currently, and she didn't come to the funeral, or even acknowledge our grandmothers death.

The consensus is that Sam should have Claire's share, to help with the children, since Claire will likely spend the money on drugs, and with that amount of money possibly overdose because Claires access to drugs is currently restricted by finances as she is not able to work.

I feel bad for not following my grandmothers will and wish we had discussed this before she passed.

Her will was written a few years ago, before Claire started using.

The other option is for Claire's share to go into trust until she is well again, but Sam could really use the money now.

48,1g3dh1x,AITA for asking my mom to not move her new BF into the home? ,"For context I moved out of home over 10 years ago. My mom lives with my two younger sisters. We don't have a normal relationship, I basically was my mom's partner growing up, I looked after my two younger sisters and we had to deal with the hell from my step dad (my sisters bio dad). We all struggle with shit because of the stuff we went through. 

My youngest sister is going through testing to be diagnosed with autism. She struggles with this, has routines, she had a cat that she adores, she doesnt have any friends and does go out much. She'll be going to college next year and that's absolutely amazing! I'm super proud of her for doing this 

Mu other sister is in the process of moving back home due to renting issues. 

Both my sister and mom know the struggles that my other sister has. Especially when it comes to having a safe space to study and live. My sister is doing so well considering the shit we had to out up with growing up from both our mom and their dad. 

My mom has only known her new bf for around a year or so now. They plan on getting married next year, he has his own place, his own family, ect. My mom plans to move him into the house soon because they're ""getting married"". She's previously said how he can be controlling, he gets weird if she even talks to another guy, how he is with his daughter. 

I think she's with him because he has a bit of money, he plans on leaving her stuff in his will and she goes everywhere, goes out a lot and he buys her a lot of stuff. She's barely ever home because she's out at his all the time or they go away all the time. 

AITA for asking her to not move him in to protect the safe space of my youngest sister. She deserves a safe space to study, to live and to feel comfortable. She struggles massively with her mental health and undiagnosed autism. 

I'm pissed because my sister has gone from living in a shit household with her narcissist alcoholic dad, not having a safe space while they were still together and my mom didn't want to leave because she wanted to wait until she got her kitchen done or Christmas was said for. My mom has put all three of us through shit because she had an easy life getting things paid for while with that asshole. And I absolutely refuse for her to let another man move into their home and ruin my sisters safe space. Especially a man she barely knows and especially when she knows the struggles my sister goes through. 

Cant she wait at least until my sister is settled in her own place with a stable job or if she moves away for college? She constantly has put men above the needs of her children and shes doing it again. Im not asking her to never live with him, maybe asking her to modify it to support her child who will be uncomfortable in her own home if he moved in. 

He has his own place and she stays there a lot anyway, why can't she stay there more often? Or wait until my sister has flown the nest?

He told me I wasn't thinking of my own future and I wasn't thinking of the long-term impacts on ""our family"".

My stepsister told me I can't avoid us being close forever. That we're sisters and one day I'll need to accept that and call her my sister and stop with the step stuff and it's been 8 years and we could have enjoyed junior and senior year together if I wasn't so determined to keep her away from me.

AITA?

And for context, I say ""sister"" like that because I don't accept her as just a sister. She's my stepsister sure but while she loves my dad like her own dad, I don't feel that way about her mom and I don't consider us like a normal family. We're a stepfamily. Nothing wrong with that but it's not the same to me as me and my dad or me and my mom (who died just before dad got married... my parents were divorced).",0.0,-0.0080340877175331,0,1

54,1g3bhhw,AITA for calling therapy a waste of time and saying we should stop going because it's not going to help us?,"Me (16f), my twin brother (16m), my mom and my mom's husband are in family therapy together. The therapist isn't bad. I talked to her alone twice before we did sessions with all of us in one room. But the reason we're in therapy and the  way my mom especially is behaving, I just know it's a waste of time. My mom and her husband want me and my brother to change our last name to her husband's name and her name now. They are also hoping we'll let him adopt us. BUT the core focus is our name. They asked us 3 years ago when they first got married and they tried to use guilt and bribery to make it happen. Guilt was mom saying we weren't really happy for her and if we were we'd accept having the same family name and let her move on from dad after being his widow for 7 years. Bribery was that her husband would pay for college, weddings and a down payment on a house when we're 25 on top of getting a new car each instead of old cars.

Now the focus is on the fact my mom and him have a kid together and mom is pregnant again. She said we should want the same name as our half siblings and we should want to be more easily identified as a family and we should want to confuse our younger siblings way less. 

This has been the thing they have focused on in therapy and they refuse to answer questions the therapist asks them. They talk over her. My brother and I were asked to leave the room 7 times in 2.5 months of appointments because the therapist needed to speak to the adults alone. The second last time we went she started saying therapy with her should end because they won't listen to her and do not want her to lead the sessions but my mom and her husband were quick to backtrack and apologize. But they brought the same stuff up last time.

And last time is when I said therapy is a waste of time and we should stop going because it's not going to help us. I told the therapist I will not change my mind. I do not want to change my name. I do not want the ""family"" name. I do not consider my mom's husband my father or even an important person in my life. I said I think my mom has changed a lot since she got married and I don't feel like she's as good of a mom as she used to be. I said I will never accept having another man's name and that he's no different than any other random dude off the street. I said having younger half siblings changes nothing for me because we will never have the same dad and we will always be a part of different families. I told them I would not work on making that a goal or try to compromise. So no adding his name to mine, etc. And I said the adults won't stop repeating themselves and talking over her (therapist) so I'm tired of us all wasting our time.

I get on with her cousin so I didn't mind. I know her cousin loves Halloween and horror movies etc so I thought it would be fun. 

My girlfriend then says we'll have to not choose horror movies and choose other Halloween themed movies. I asked why and she said it's because her cousin is 16. I pointed out that her cousin loves horror movies and had seen a lot anyway. 

I mentioned that she's seen at least one of the one we were talking about watching but my girlfriend said on and that we wouldn't be able to play the horror games either.

She got annoyed at this and said it's not a big deal but I told her it was to me when she's happy to just completely change what we were doing and expect me to be fine with it. 

I asked why she won't put horror movies on when her cousin is there since her cousin watches them anyway and she just said she doesn't think we should but refused to give an actual reason. 

I said I don't want her cousin coming if it's going to ruin our plans but my girlfriend said I was being unfair.

I take care of the dog (who was originally supposed to be my dad's dog, but he didn't care for so eventually she became the ""family dog"" but since nobody except for me did anything with her she's mine now), clean up the mess in the kitchen almost daily, am always the one who has to load and unload the dishwasher. Taking care of a dog doesn't sound like much but it's a lot because I've been training her with no previous knowledge or trainer, I'm the one walking her everyday (even if I'm not home and she's crying to go outside they won't even go into the garden with her unless she's on the brink of shitting inside), feeding her, buying the food, making sure she's healthy, getting her to the vet. Essentially to the rest of the family she's just something to cuddle with whenever they feel like it. 

My mom does laundry and cooks once a week (if she feels like it). I don't think that it's a lot. She cooks for herself everyday but leaves the mess most days. To the point where she will cook herself some Spaghetti and leave the sauce pot on the stove for days until there's mold growing in it. Anytime I try to bring it up that it'd be so much cleaner if everybody just cleans up the mess they make, she starts yelling about how when she was my age she was doing the whole household by herself so I've stopped trying. 

Now my parents want to have another kid and say I would have to do more around the house. When I asked what they said cleaning and babysitting. I snapped and asked why in the world should I clean up their messes just because they're too lazy. I'm also horrible with babies and hardly have any free time already. I leave home at 6:30 and come home earliest at 3:30PM, then have to walk the dog and make myself something to eat. And it's not like I can just eat something small because we only have ingredients and not ready to eat food. Plus homework and studying, then more chores. I told them they should rather use a rubber than burden me with more of their shitty decisions that they don't think through. They grounded me and said I'm disrespectful and a brat.

Often when I’m high I can’t concentrate on anything so I opt out of playing card games with them. Instead I usually lay down and sit with my thoughts for a while. Once the high starts to go away I go to sleep.

I recently brought up another unrelated issue with them in the hopes that they would listen, but instead they began accusing me of wasting their weed seemingly out of the blue. 

Their reasoning is that I’m boring to be around, and that I go to sleep before everyone else and “waste” the high. This is never something they’ve confronted me about before, and one time they even said that it was good that weed makes me tired due to my issues with sleep deprivation.

I want to know if I’m the asshole for being upset about this, because I have been very clear with them in the past about how I am a lightweight. They have never mentioned any of this before, and I want to make it clear that I only get high when they offer first.

64,1g397wp,AITA for asking my friends not to talk about wedding planning during my birthday dinner?,"I (38F) recently went through a breakup that has left me shattered. With my birthday approaching, I wanted a small dinner with female friends. I invited only a tight-knit group, including my best friend (36F, Emily) and my older sister (42F, Sarah). However, another one of my closest friends (35F, Anna) just got engaged, and the thought of hearing her talk about wedding planning makes my skin crawl. I can’t stand the idea of sitting there while she gushes over flowers, venues, and every little bullshit that feels so painful to me right now.

With the dinner just a week away, I decided to send a message to the group, “Okay, listen up: there will be absolutely NO wedding talk at my birthday dinner. I just got out of a relationship and I refuse to spend my special day listening to that. I deserve one night to celebrate myself so let’s focus on me!”. Instead of the understanding I expected, I was met with backlash. Emily texted me privately saying my message was too aggressive.

I reached out to my sister but she completely dismissed me. She told me I should be more considerate of others and accused me of being jealous. That’s when I completely lost it. I pointed out how I’ve endured Sarah endlessly talk about her boring husband and stupid sons for years without a single complaint, yet she couldn’t muster any empathy for me during this tough time. She reacted badly to this and call me unhinged.

65,1g3906x,AITA for telling my friend she is not invited to come to a hang out with another friend circle of mine?,"I have this friend, let’s call her Amy. Amy is a nice person but still a relatively new friend (met her 2 years ago when I was working across the country for a work assignment and she happened to be an intern. Neither of us knew anyone in the city so we started hanging out.

Fast forward, after I moved back we stayed in touch. We’ve even traveled together and have always gotten along. 

A couple of things, however, have annoyed me on some of these trips. For example, I have noticed she can be a little selfish (especially with money) and needy (i.e. needs me to hold her bags and her hand when she drinks, navigate on my phone whenever we go anywhere, be in charge of calling Ubers, paying for all the meals (which she does pay me back for) but she will often find a way to shortchange me (I have gotten better about noticing these little tricks like uneven trades (her paying for a $1 bus for us and me paying $30 for meals)) 

Now admittedly I am not the best at dealing with people who are clingy, but I do understand and I wouldn’t leave the friendship because of this. I want to emphasize that a few friends she made during her internship have cut her out because of these things.

So most recently, we were traveling and she has been doing some of the same things as she typically does. (Btw, she is actually a really fun person so we do enjoy traveling with each other) I have also learned to draw boundaries and have been better about telling her no. I noticed she had become a little off-standish towards me, but I let it go.

I planned on seeing a few friends in the city (including a cousin I hadn’t seen in about 10 years) and I was excited to catch up. My cousin and I have both been going through a rough time so I was particularly excited about having some 1 on 1 time with her. 

When I told Amy I was going to meet my cousin and friends in the city, she felt entitled to invite herself and had repeatedly asked me when “we’re” going to meet them. Now, I know I should have said something right from the start, but she takes things so personally that I avoided the conversation. The problem is that other people notice the same things I do but don’t always tolerate them as well as I do, and also she has a tendency to take over conversations so I’m afraid I wouldn’t have been able to truly reconnect with this group.

I ended up telling her she wouldn’t be able to join me as we’re trying to keep this a private event. She said she understood, but she ended up calling me after the vacation to let me know how pissed off she was.

I need to know, should I have just let her tag along? A few people have said I should’ve just let her join. AITA?

We have been going through a rough patch for the past year and things are extremely tense. I have been trying very hard to make her happy but i seem to always miss the mark for one reason or another, tonight was no different.

My wife and I were having a discussion regarding our oldest son (17 M) and his bullying of our youngest son (12 M). Well after the conversation and my son left the room she stated she is not happy about the way he treated him. I replied “I agree” and thought that was it. 

She then said very ambiguously “He is acting Goofy” I was not certain exactly what she was referencing. So I asked “how so” and she just gave me this disgusted face and said “just goofy”. When I tried to ask her to give me some examples I was met with more disgusted faces and a statement from her that “she can’t say anything to me without it being a whole thing”. She then informed me she could not even have “this conversation” with me.

I simply said ok and was about to give her space when she just sort a snapped. Started heading up the stairs ranting about how she will go search his room (maybe for drugs/alcohol) because I won’t “man up”. 

I then tried to explain that I don’t mind going to talk to him, I just was not sure specifically what she wanted me to look into based solely off the comment of him acting “goofy”.

She then proceeded to tell me that I am just impossible and she just doesn’t get why I “always need her to hold my hand”.

I’ve been with my boyfriend (20m) for just over ten months and we’re discussing a hypothetical wedding. We both know we want to wait until after I graduate college to get married, if we’re still together by then.

I’m going to call him D just so I don’t get confused.

When D graduated from high school, he wore bright red. It looked okay for a graduation, I get it, you want to stand out. But for a wedding where you’re the groom? I can’t see that. And let me clarify; he doesn’t want to wear bright Santa Clause red like at his grad, he wants to wear a darker maroon. 

When I imagined my wedding since forever, I always imagined my man wearing a nice, classy black suit to offset my white dress. And the color scheme, I always pictured it being lilac purple or some light color like that, paired with a light green. Maroon doesn’t look good with that picture.

I know that obviously I need to compromise and plan with my fiancé about what WE want on our day, but I feel like I, the girl, care a little more?

Also, I think the reason why D wants a coloured suit because his dad wore a navy one at his wedding. And D wants to be different… by doing the same thing as his dad? 

When I brought up these points, he emphasized that it’s his day and he will where what he wants.

When I imagined my wedding since forever, I always imagined my man wearing a nice, classy black suit to offset my white dress. And the color scheme, I always pictured it being lilac purple or some light color like that, paired with a light green. Maroon doesn’t look good with that picture.

I know that obviously I need to compromise and plan with my fiancé about what WE want on our day, but I feel like I, the girl, care a little more?

Also, I think the reason why D wants a coloured suit because his dad wore a navy one at his wedding. And D wants to be different… by doing the same thing as his dad? 

When I brought up these points, he emphasized that it’s his day and he will where what he wants. I get that he wants to stand out, and he is that type of person, but shouldn’t he also listen to my thoughts and what I’ve been imagining my entire life versus what he’s pictured for four hours?",1.0,1.058422565460205,1,1
71,1g38lmr,WIBTA for not going to a relative’s wedding?,"I (29F) live 3,000 miles away from my entire family, including a relative who just got engaged (30F). We were close growing up, but then family drama caused us to never be able to see each other and now it’s only once every 5 or so years. We rarely talk to each other, only to wish each other a happy birthday and to congratulate each other on stuff like this, but we talk a lot at family events on the rare occasion we both are there.

Not going to this wedding may not piss off this particular relative, but it would infuriate that whole side of the family. They are very drama-oriented, they nit pick, and they would take it out on my parents or sisters, not me. In that regard, it would be selfish not to go since my family didn’t sign up for that. 

However, like I said, I live 3,000 miles away. My parents buy me plane tickets whenever I come into town, but then I still have to buy the dress (it will likely be black tie and must be pre-approved by other relatives) plus take PTO that I don’t really have much of. I’m not in the best financial situation or health situation - I’m wearing a heart monitor as I type this - and I need to conserve all the PTO I can. 

It’s worth noting that I did go to this relative’s sister’s wedding 5 years ago, shortly after I moved to where I am now - for the same reason, it would have caused too much drama not to go. So I feel like it wouldn’t be fair not to attend this relative’s wedding.

We invited her to come live with my family after she left my dad about 3 months ago. They are currently in the process of getting a divorce and she has access to 6 figures in her bank account. My mom has recently been diagnosed with cancer and is about to finish her radiation treatments and then move into having chemo infusions for 3 months. She is also almost completely disabled and uses a walker to get around, but she really struggles and with the radiation treatments, even more so than normal due to the extra tiredness.

I have been stretched to my limit when it comes to my normal responsibilities of raising my kids as well as homeschooling them in addition to all of the care that I have been providing my mom.

This weekend I ended up staying the night at my parents house and my mom offered me breakfast  which was some oatmeal banana muffin thing. I reminded her that I am allergic to bananas and said I’d make my own breakfast but thanks. 

She suddenly got extremely defensive. She told me that I keep making up problems to feel special and that I can’t possibly have all these issues. I was very confused to this reaction because up until now my mom has been supportive and helpful through my diagnosis’s. I pointed out that she was there for both my allergic reactions and she was the one who suggested I could be allergic to bananas because they were making my mouth itchy. She also had taken me to the hospital after I vomited blood. she responded that if I was really allergic to bananas to prove it and eat the muffin. I asked if her whole goal with these muffins was some elaborate plan to either kill me or catch me in a lie 

This lead to a screaming match she was saying things like  “how dare you accuse me of trying to kill my daughter” My dad eventually comes out and he immediately takes her side but I’m over it and I leave while yelling that they were crazy for thinking i’d lie about this. I definitely used some choice words and called my mom a bitch during my rant. 

When I got home I saw that my mom and dad had put me in a group chat with my older brother, they sent a long paragraph that basically read as an intervention saying i had “Munchausen by proxy” (wrong disorder) and they were just trying to do what’s best. They also said I was not allowed to see or talk to my little sister until I apologized to them and admitted to lying.

75,1g38bmw,AITA for ‘ruining’ a friendship?,"My friend (we'll call her Millie) and I have been friends since high school, and boyfriend (we'll call him Owen) have been together just as long.

Millie and I always had a kind of rocky friendship. She was your classic crisis friend, and she had done snakey things through the years around my boyfriend that I overlooked way too quickly.

Eg: as most high school couples do, we broke up once after we went long distance, he came back to town and she took a picture with him and sent it to me?
Secretly went and met him behind my back for a smoke with him...

Anyways, around 3 years ago Owen and I moved in together, and typical crisis friend fashion, she needed a place to stay and moved in with us for about 6 months waiting for her new place. There were a few signs I overlooked during that time too, but I wasn't too worried as I trusted Owen completely. After that, we were basically inseparable. They 'both' like cars, and so more often than not we were all out for drives together.

We broke up early into the year due to a few reasons, and a few months before had both fallen out with Millie after she was rude and extremely disrespectful to him while he was (once again) fixing her car for free after another crash. We both made up with her on our own, and were both fine with the situation until she started mentioning one to thr y other.
After a month or so of this, Owen and I began other.

After a month or so of this, Owen and I began reconnecting and sorting things out, which she didn't seem too happy about. 

We eventually began discussing her and figured out she was doing more than smack talking both of us, she was intentionally trying to get us with other people knowing just how hurt we both still were over each other, and on top of that, she had been trying to make moves with him.

Neither of us spoke to her for a few days as I wasn't sure how to handle it, and he didn't want to start anything incase she kicked off with me. She text him asking 'what was going on' and at this point I told him to do what he wants, so he confronted her. I got a different 'I've reached out too many times take care I'm blocking you both' type message. I text her back telling her I wasn't ignoring her to be rude, I just didn't have the energy to deal with the situation and couldn't understand why she'd intentionally try to hurt us both.

Owen never got a reply, but she went MAD on me. Calling me jealous, saying I ruined their friendship, ‘wormed my way back into his life’ and all sorts of names. I feel like I’m right, but something about it just eats at me.

So due to him (and quite a few others) we had to add an additional rule that the employee would need to show some sort of proof that, at the very least, some of the money used goes to what they had mentioned the loan was for.

The employee in question had applied for a loan in order to take his sick dad to the hospital. Since he wanted to take him to a private hospital, he had asked for quite a hefty loan. He did qualify for a loan, but I had still needed proof in order to fully approve the loan. Not asking for a full medical breakdown, but just some note or something  from the hospital that thet could give to HR in order for me to go ahead with the loan. He did not. He then came again asking for the money personally and I said I cannot approve it unless I have proof and offered to pay to transfer him to a public hospital on my own dime. He agreed. His father was seen, observed and discharged the next day. I thought that would be that.

Few weeks go by and his father passed away. I got informed because the compamy pays a set funeral expense for immediate family members.

77,1g38ama,AITA for telling my husband no about his brother asking to live with us again. ,"⚠️Warning⚠️ mentions of death 

I’m gonna try to keep this short and simple but it’s a lot. My husband (25m) has a brother (17m) who has Asperger’s syndrome. He came to live with us after their mom passed from a massive stroke and moved out when I (22f) found out I was pregnant with twins. He left so that we could have room for them. While he was living with us he caused a lot of problems between me and my husbands marriage due to how he was behaving and how he was treating me. He was always disrespectful towards me and didn’t approve of mine and my husbands lifestyle and complained to my husband about it and would talk bad about me behind my back. He did a lot of other things while living with us but it’s a lot of detail. 

For the past couple of months he’s been living with their oldest brother and his fiance and kids. And apparently he’s been treating his brothers fiance the same way he treated me and it’s caused some tension in their relationship. Since he started living with them he has been at our house almost every single day and eats and drinks mine and our oldest food. I finally had to tell him that he needs to either stop or he will be buying them. He also sometimes shows up unannounced without any warning or even text that he wants to come over. There’s more but again so much more stuff to talk about. 

Well me and my husband are in the process of buying our first house which is the perfect amount of space for our oldest and the twins. But today my husbands brother came over as soon as I was leaving for church. I got back home and his brother is leaving and says “I’m leaving bc I don’t want to stay if your wife is gonna be ticked off when you ask her the question”. After he leaves I ask my husband what he was talking about and apparently he had asked my husband if he could come and live with us again when we move into our new house and that he would pay us $500 to live there. I immediately told him no and explained why I didn’t want his brother living with us again. My husband got mad and tried to ask again but I told him my answer would always be no. He didn’t talk to me again until he brought up another conversation (which might possibly be a part 2 because it’s long) and we haven’t talked since. So AITA?

After he leaves I ask my husband what he was talking about and apparently he had asked my husband if he could come and live with us again when we move into our new house and that he would pay us $500 to live there. I immediately told him no and explained why I didn’t want his brother living with us again. My husband got mad and tried to ask again but I told him my answer would always be no. He didn’t talk to me again until he brought up another conversation (which might possibly be a part 2 because it’s long) and we haven’t talked since. So AITA? I’m sorry it doesn’t explain a lot so if you have questions I will try to answer them in the comments. ",0.0,0.0071942992508411,0,1
78,1g3836c,AITA for refusing free food?,"So, I currently work remote as a software developer. I've been apartment hunting because I'd prefer not to live with my parents forever. When I looked around my area, the lease for decent places here are between 1800-2400 a month. I looked around the area for cheaper ones that are around $1200-$1500 in rent, but those ones get snapped up real fast, and I end up competing with other people who are also trying to lease the place. difficult to get. After looking around a bit, I noticed that apartments at Barstow was REALLY cheap. Like, $850-950 a month cheap.

It really felt like a ghost town in some areas. The mall was pretty much empty except for one odd game shop that's open. At night I drove by this mexican food stand on the side of the road which had a REALLY long line. I was curious why the hell this one mexican food stand had such a long line when everywhere else i took a look at was a ghost town. So, I stopped by to look to see what they were making. When I walked close to take a look, a tall black man who looked pretty fit yelled out that ""lines back there!"" I responded that I was just trying to see what they were selling, I noticed that it was just tacos.

I bought u Tacos!"" I was pretty intimidated by him at this point from him snapping at me earlier when i was trying to check out the stall along with the knowledge that the area has very high crime rate and its dangerous to be out at night.

He (28M) cheated on me last month and for the sake of our children I am trying to forgive and move past it. Obviously it hasn’t been that long since I caught him cheating and I’m still healing and trying therapy, I’m even taking antidepressants since the incident. 

One thing that bothers me in particular since I caught him cheating is that the only reason I found out was because the other woman tried calling him at 3am and it woke me up. That being said, one of my triggers since that night is hearing a phone go off in the middle of the night. I’ve had to silence my phone when going to bed otherwise even a tiny notification sets me off and I’m back to the initial trauma of just unrelenting depression. 

Now, I tried letting him back in the same room as me last night. I forgot to tell him that he needs to silence his phone at night and when his phone got a text late at night, it woke me up and I just started bawling. I don’t want to be upset but something just goes off when I hear a phone at night. Anyway, he wakes up and is almost upset with me bc I’m supposed to be trying to forgive him. I said that I was trying but he broke my trust and it was taking a lot for me to even be in the same room as him. 

Fast forward to tonight. He’s staying with his parents and I just let him know about how the phone going off is a trigger for me and moving forward, he’ll need to silence his phone at night until I’m able to let this go.

Things got better when I was older (the hitting) and it became more scolding. My sister would still “participate” in doing the chores but she actually got nothing done.

When we moved to our new house (2018), my sister just became even lazier and would not even get up before 10am in the mornings.

TLDR: My friend got pregnant after a one night stand and while initially was going to keep it; ended up getting an abortion. I’ve done my best to support her through her grief and regret for over a year but am out of my depth. She did a pencil doodle of an abortion floating in a tub and texted it to me out of the blue without warning and I told her I didn’t know how to respond and now she seems distant and upset 

Full story: 

My friend and I both met as teenagers, and have been friends for close to a decade now. We both have struggled with our mental health immensely and are in and out of treatment centers. One of the ways her mental illness presents is risky sexual activity. She’ll go through periods of having multiple one night stands a week with complete strangers and not use protection. For years now I’ve been who she texted in the middle of the night to make sure she got home safe, the one going with her to get tested (and treated) for STDs, the one begging her to use protection and not sleep with strangers, the one going with her to get pregnancy test and after pregnancy test. 

Finally, about a year and half ago, the worst did happen and she was actually pregnant. This was NOT ideal, she was unemployed, unwell mentally and physically, the guy was a one night stand who actually lived across the country. Her and I are both pro choice but she pretty quickly decided she was keeping it and would just figure it out. 

However her resolve started to break as she got horrible horrible morning sickness, her body began to change, her mental health got worse, and the reality of her situation began to set in. She did finally get an abortion. I won’t go into detail but it was fairly traumatic for her and she’s had some level of regret and grief ever since. I’ve done my best to support her and help her through this, but she also knows I believe she made the right choice and she was in no position to raise a child. 

Earlier today I received a text out of nowhere that was a… cartoon style pencil doodle of her abortion.

i begrudgingly did, i don’t think he deserves to use it because he doesn’t pay for anything in the house (i pay my mom rent, help her with other bills, and also help clean the house etc), my brother doesn’t pay a dime to my mom except the car he stole out from me (long story), and even then he barely pays her enough so she typically has to also put money in. like i said my brother is terrible and i don’t want him to have any of these things. 

before he went to his appt and my mom insistently gave him the card, i told him under no conditions does he get those expensive things they offer (the health yearly exam, he already got it, and blue light) and told him he should limit his expenses to under 300. he assured me he would.

well he comes back from his appointment, and spent over 400 dollars. on what? i don’t even know. i don’t interrogate him since we start fighting, and he “promises” he’ll give my mom a portion of that money back. so whatever right?
well after a bit of talking he slips saying that he actually only paid for HALF OF HIS FRAMES at that one visit and when he goes to pick them up he will be paying the rest. 
my mom of course is telling him to use the card for it all, but he spent a ridiculous amount already. i stood my ground and said absolutely not. if he spend much more, that’s a large portion of our hsa funds, and i haven’t even been to another doctor since, plus we don’t even know if there might be emergency visits.

My boyfriend (26) is more sensitive to heat—he has a “cat’s tongue” if you will. When I make us both tea, I serve his in this mug that changes color with heat. As the tea cools, the design on the mug gradually becomes an opaque black. He’s told me in the past this mug is a helpful gauge for him.

Now he’s insisting I serve it to him at a temperature that’s perfect for him to drink. Instead of just waiting until his tea cools down, he wants me to steep his tea differently. This, amongst a pattern of other unusual expectations, makes me feel like more of a butler than a girlfriend. 

I asked if he wanted tea because I was making some for myself and he said “are you going to make it like I asked?”. When I replied he was being ridiculous, he said I was inconsiderate. I just don’t see why his impatience to wait for his tea to cool is my problem. I already make an effort of always using that heat sensitive mug for him, which isn’t dishwasher safe so I hand wash after every use.

My boyfriend (26) is more sensitive to heat—he has a “cat’s tongue” if you will. When I make us both tea, I serve his in this mug that changes color with heat. As the tea cools, the design on the mug gradually becomes an opaque black. He’s told me in the past this mug is a helpful gauge for him.

Now he’s insisting I serve it to him at a temperature that’s perfect for him to drink. Instead of just waiting until his tea cools down, he wants me to steep his tea differently. This, amongst a pattern of other unusual expectations, makes me feel like more of a butler than a girlfriend. 

I asked if he wanted tea because I was making some for myself and he said “are you going to make it like I asked?”. When I replied he was being ridiculous, he said I was inconsiderate. I just don’t see why his impatience to wait for his tea to cool is my problem. I already make an effort of always using that heat sensitive mug for him, which isn’t dishwasher safe so I hand wash after every use. I don’t see why I also have to steep his tea in some special (and incorrect at that) way. AITA? ",0.0,0.1458967179059982,0,1
86,1g377xg,AITA for telling my best friend how I truly feel?,"
Before we get into it, I am fairly young (f16) and my best friend also f 17… but I need the advice.


Me and my best friend ( let’s call her Emma) have been friends since the 3rd and 4th grade ( about 9-10 years) but when I entered high school we got a lot closer and became best friends. I’ve always had the troubled past and would get into things I shouldn’t have and had a lot of mental health problems. I’m a junior in high school now and doing a lot better. Emma, after a year of my bad habits and addiction to things followed up on one of my addictions ( vaping) which I haven’t stopped that just everything else. I never had a problem with anything until she began to be more obvious about it. She doesn’t want her mom knowing because she is very strict, but I have repeatedly told her that she should eventually tell her mother about her addiction sometime in the near future, but instead always pushed it aside and said that her mom would be very angry and might go crazy in a way. I didn’t want to cause anything so I let it go. Until recently in the last 6 months, she has been telling her mom things about me that I only wanted her to know. ( personal things that I wouldn’t tell my parents) her mother began making backhanded comments and jokes about my sex life and my addiction. She also would warn Emma about how of a bad influence I can be. I would get very offended in a way because she would say these things in front of me and I would never pressure anyone into doing something they are not comfortable with. But I let it slide. A few months go by and Emma’s mom went into her room to grab something and saw a vape. Her mom was very mad and began texting her asking what that was. Emma, began telling her that it was mine and I had kept it at her house because I didn’t want my parents knowing.

She loves lock picking, tinkering with old phones (and selling them with new batteries and screens) and outdoor sports. It probably comes from her being raised by a single dad after her mom’s accident. First time she took me hunting I couldn’t believe she just hauled a deer around and skinned it like she had been doing it her whole life. She doesn’t ever wear makeup, last time was probably as a bridesmaid at her friend’s wedding 3 years ago. 

I’m not the only one who has ever made a lesbian joke at her. She doesn’t seem to care and just jokes she has had girls hit on her and seems to laugh along. She is attractive so it’s not a stereotypical jab at her looks, it’s more so the way she talks and what she knows. She is a software engineer now and has no female coworkers so if anything it’s only gotten more pronounced. She has no idea how to do “girl” talk but can name all the F1 drivers. 

She had been saving for a car for a while and I went to the dealership with her and she has gotten to a few dealerships. This was a Mazda dealership but they had a Subaru trade in and she liked it immediately. It was a green crossover and she said it just “resonated with her”. I joked if the reason is because lesbians like Subaru and she blew up and marched back to my car and wouldn’t speak with me the rest of the trip back. She hasn’t talked at length to me since last Sat but this evening I got back and I saw the same Subaru parked in my parking spot. I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for my joke though I thought she wouldn’t have an issue with it from all the other times other people have made the joke.

I'm the primary breadwinner since Nate lost his job at the start of our relationship and is struggling to keep one, though he contributes by cooking and helping with my nieces. We're paycheck to paycheck, sometimes even hitting negative.

Nate has a best friend, Peri (23M), who has been a big part of his life for eight years. Peri used to be a great guy but got into hard drugs like fentanyl and coke. His fiancée died from an overdose, and Peri spent some time in prison. After getting out, Peri seemed to be doing okay until he started dating Javanna (20F), who has her own mental health issues. Their relationship is abusive and toxic.

Peri moved out of his dad's house and Nate asked if Peri could stay with us for a few days until he found a place. I agreed, but days turned into weeks. Peri didn't contribute financially, didn’t clean up after himself, and just played video games with Nate all day. Then Javanna started coming around, despite having stolen from us, including Nate’s medication. We banned her from our house and warned Peri that if she came back, we’d call the cops.

One day, Peri asked Nate to drive him to his hometown, and instead of staying with a friend, Peri directed him to a trap house, bought drugs, and used them. Nate drove Peri back to our home while he was high, likely bringing drugs into our house. This is a huge issue for me because I could lose my job and get kicked out of nursing school if drugs were found in our home.

Despite my pleas for Peri to leave, Nate kept insisting he could handle it. The final straw came when Peri and Javanna got into another fight after Peri invited her to an abandoned house for sex. They came banging on our door, and Peri was clearly on something again. I tried talking to Nate, but he kept saying he could manage it. Frustrated, I left to stay at my mom's for the night.

When I came back, Nate had dropped Peri off at a Greyhound bus stop to live with his sister. While I’m relieved, Nate has been cold and angry with me since. He says he feels like he turned his back on a friend he's known for eight years, and that it's not in his nature to refuse someone in need. We got into a nasty fight, and I raised my voice and got ugly back. 

But I feel like it wasn’t his help he was offering—it was mine. It was my money, my time cleaning up after Peri, and my home. Plus, I’m deeply uncomfortable with drugs in our house due to my upbringing around them.

97,1g366i4,AITA for not giving my family more money to fix their housing crisis?,"In march of 2023, my mom (48f) tells me (22m) that we’re being evicted in a week. After talking about it with her, she says that she’s known for 3 months now and didn’t tell me because she didn’t want me to worry about it. She had stopped paying the rent for some reason, to which she still won’t tell me.

With only a week to come up with a plan, I had no choice but to book a hotel. I had hoped it would only be for a week, but it ended up being over a year, moving around various hotels. Meanwhile, my mom and the rest of my family went to DSS and applied for emergency housing. They applied without me, and when I tried to apply myself, I was rejected because my income was above their threshold.

So with the hotel costing pretty much everything I had, I ended up not being able to save anything and barely keeping myself alive. Eventually, I found a friend who would let me stay for a couple months. So I was able to start saving up for my own place.

I tell my mom that I would have a new place for us within a couple months, but for some reason she told me she would not be moving in with me, basically blaming me for the eviction. So I moved on with my life, looking for an apartment of my own.

Last month, she calls and says that DSS has stopped giving them assistance. She says they now need me to pay for their hotel stay, because they can’t afford it themselves. They say they only need a week, until they can “figure something out.” So I give them the money. And the next week, she calls and asks for more.

I can’t afford to pay for their hotel stay, and if I keep trying, I’m not going to be able to get my own apartment. So I tell her I can’t give her any more money, but she still keeps asking. I block her number, she gets my dad to call me. I can’t ignore her, she keeps trying to call me.

98,1g35xxw,WIBTA for not visiting my family because im allergic to their dogs?,"Im allergic to dogs that shed their hair.
Ive been like this since birth. All my family members have dogs and lately they like to bring their dogs to the house where everyone is hosting but it affects my allergies. Some of the dogs are hypoallergenic and thats fine but some of them are not and they shed. I try to avoid them but they still run around and try to approach me.

I have trouble breathing and my nose starts to drip like a faucet. Even when I come home after and remove my clothes I am still suffering for at least 24 to 48 hours afterwards.

One of my family members told me that I still need to live life and take an allergy pill, which made me upset because I do take allergy pills and nasal sprays and nasal decongestants all at once and they still dont help even at doses higher than recommended. Ive tried to be proactive about this and took all these meds several times but every time I am still suffering. When my mom talks to them about my suffering in passing, apparently they roll their eyes as if Im being too dramatic about it. Then they try to suggest some other solution I should do as if Im not trying already.

Honestly i dont even feel like its worth it to visit them anymore if im just going to be stuffed up, out of breath, miserable, and upset that no one really understands how I am feeling. But at the same time I dont really want to damage my relationship with my family.

99,1g35xrt,AITA for making my friends drive back home during a road trip because I didn’t want to stay overnight?,"So, I was on a road trip with a few friends this past weekend. We were supposed to drive out to this small town, grab some food, check out a couple of spots, and then head back the same day—simple enough.



While we were there, we stumbled across this bar that had a live band playing, and my friends got super into it. They wanted to stick around, grab some drinks, and make a night out of it. Admittedly I was super into the idea too because it was very much up my alley. The thing is, none of us had planned to stay overnight. We didn’t pack anything, and the plan was always to go home after.



They started talking about just booking a cheap motel in walking distance and staying the night so we could keep hanging out. I immediately said I wasn’t cool with that because I can’t sleep unless I’m in my own pajamas, and I didn’t bring them. It’s just how I am, and I figured since this was a day trip, it wouldn’t be an issue.



They tried convincing me to just go with it and stay the night, but I wasn’t budging. I said if someone drove me to a store before they close, I would be happy to buy some pajamas but nothing nearby was open. I said someone could stay sober as the designated driver, but none of them wanted to do that (I don’t have a license so I couldn’t be the designated driver). They even offered to not make me chip in for the motel which was nice, but I was wearing a nice shirt and jeans (aka clothes I could not sleep in). In the end, since I can’t drive, they all had to pack it up and head home with me. The whole ride back was awkward. None of them really said anything but I could tell they were pissed.

100,1g35q7d,WIBTA if my group does our own project leaving one member out? ,"I keep finding myself in-between problems with loud people... So now I need help again but first fake names and backstory. 

To keep anonymous I'll be purposefully vague. Keep that in mind. 

Marie- BSF
Clemin- Spanish friend
Lin- loud person

So in science we were assigned a group project about deadly gases/ substances and originally the group consisted of me, Marie and Clemin. That was it. Until the teacher realized the Lin didn't have anybody with her and shackled us with her. I don't like Lin for many reasons and I especially don't like working with her. She is notoriously unpredictable and unreliable. So we had like two weeks to do this project as a power point and we were all assigned which information we were to gather. But then the Monday of the first week, Lin told me and Clemin she had done the ENTIRE THING herself, which only left us with getting fun facts for bonus marks. That internally pissed me off cus she said nothing at ALL.
( I later found out that was due to her not having a phone but she had our emails so that was not really an excuse)

So I did informed Marie as she was ill and home from school. Fast forward the day comes we have everything Marie is no longer ill, but Lin went home for some reason (word of mouth says she threw up or had a migraine idk) the teacher gave us a pass for the next class. And Lin didn't show up again and we had no reliable way of contacting her either since she apparently doesn't check her emails at all. She was the only one with access to the PowerPoint so we couldn't do it. So I got fed up and with Marie in toe asked the teacher to do it ourselves  and let Lin present what she did. Teacher agreed and we spent the day today doing that . Now I was informed the Lin emailed Marie asking if we were going to present tomorrow (the next science class) and she asked the group what to do. Clemin didn't respond, assuming she was sleeping or busy I responded telling her to say no. 
We had already done our project  with info we had gathered for the project that she decided to do on her own and I had made an email we all had access to, as I had suggested at the very beginning.  Marie said okay and left for a bit. I know Lin is going to say something or complain to her ""friends""  that had room in their groups but didn't invite her and that talk shit when she isnt here. 
I do still plan on just presenting the project with just me Clemin and Marie but I want to make sure I'm morally in the clear, so WIBTA?

105,1g35bp9,AITA for regifting old but unused presents from my brother back to my niece?,"My brother (38M) and I (28F) have always been very close, but differ largely in personality.

Relevantly, I have a strong stance on gifts which everyone knows. I describe myself as a “relaxed” minimalist due to environmental concerns - I’m not trying to fit my trash into a jar because I don’t think that’s productive but I always put a lot of thought into what I consume to minimise my wastefulness generally. I also travel a lot and will move overseas in a few years for work, so lots of material possessions are a massive inconvenience for me as I can only fit so much into a suitcase. As such, I don’t like gifts and always just ask for cash or them to donate to a charity. The majority of people in my life are very happy to oblige but my brother always INSISTS that he must get me a gift on days like birthdays, which I find quite aggravating especially when I have made very clear my stance.

I have preserved his presents in pristine condition with the original packaging so it’s not like I’m giving her nasty hand me downs, and feel a lot better letting go of the gifts knowing it’ll be put to use.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-14,"AITA for regifting old but unused presents from my brother back to my niece? My brother (38M) and I (28F) have always been very close, but differ largely in personality.

Relevantly, I have a strong stance on gifts which everyone knows. I describe myself as a “relaxed” minimalist due to environmental concerns - I’m not trying to fit my trash into a jar because I don’t think that’s productive but I always put a lot of thought into what I consume to minimise my wastefulness generally. I also travel a lot and will move overseas in a few years for work, so lots of material possessions are a massive inconvenience for me as I can only fit so much into a suitcase. As such, I don’t like gifts and always just ask for cash or them to donate to a charity. The majority of people in my life are very happy to oblige but my brother always INSISTS that he must get me a gift on days like birthdays, which I find quite aggravating especially when I have made very clear my stance.

Our relationship has pretty much been perfect and she’s my best friend and my favorite person ever. But here’s the thing I am going to Navy Basic Training soon. I have a bearded dragon named Captain. I’ve needed someone to take care of him while I was gone. And I asked my girlfriend . She said no. Well she’s my only choice and if she doesn’t take care of him I’m going to have to give him away and I don’t want to have to do that. I’ve had him for 8 months, he’s like my best friend. 

Now it’s not like she’s never done this before, she’s taken care of Captain for two weeks while I was away on a mission trip. She did an amazing job and he was healthy. That was three months ago.

She’s telling me she doesn’t want the responsibility of taking care of him. She said she thinks she’d forget about him, and she said she doesn’t like how he smells. She’s never brought this to me! I’m so upset because she knows that if she doesn’t take him I’ll have to give him away. Basic training is only 8 weeks and I wish she would just make the sacrifice for 8 weeks. It feels like it’s a red flag that she’s not gonna do this for me. 

I know she said she would forget but I mean there’s so many alarms she could set and a lot of resources to help her. Am I being to dramatic, tears flood my eyes just thinking about giving him away.

I don't want to for a few reasons that I've discussed with her:

1. I don't hang out with her brother very often and never without my fiance. We are friendly and I have nothing against him, but he's not a core friend of mine. To compare, my fiance has spent way more time with my sister because she lives close. Her brother lives 400mi away and I see him maybe 2 or 3 times a year. My fiance believes this is a good opportunity to get to know him better. 

2. The age difference. Everyone else at the bachelor party will be over 30 years old, even one over 40. 

3. Her brother is very different from my friends and I. He's like a quiet gamer guy. He smokes weed occasionally and barely drinks. When he visited for a birthday party we threw, he spent most of the night playing online video games with his friends from home in a room. I can pretty much guarantee there will be copious amounts of drinking and drug use at my bachelor party. I don't really want to expose him to that and don't want to tone it down cause he's present. I don't do any of this stuff when I see him and I am 99% sure he has no idea that I do. My fiance thinks I should just have a more civil bachelor party so I can include her brother. She is OK with my drug and alcohol use in general (I don't have addiction issues, lead a very healthy lifestyle otherwise, and have my shit together). 

And before anyone assumes it's cause of strippers, I've already made it clear to my friends that I do not want strippers at my bachelor party.

 during the summer of 2022 I got a sinus infection, something I'm prone to so I did what I usually did for home treatment. it didn't go away so I went to my mom about it who blamed the masks for it and just told me it wasn't as bad as I was making it out to be
 i continued with home care and it didn't go away- instead it got worse, I was throwing up food water and my pills for other unrelated issues. I begged my mom to take me in which she replied with saying they'll have to give me a shot in my butt- not afraid of needles but I hate being naked in front of people- so I gave up asking her and my condition got worse

after a couple days she relants and takes me in where the doctor said I was dehydrated and my lack of pills being taken caused it. they pumped some fluids on me via a Iv and sent me on my way. 

on the way out I peed myself  (something I didn't do since I was 5) and mom just bought me new pants and made me continue on my way. we almost went out to eat and then home when I had ""seizure like activity"" (doctors words not mine) in the back of the truck scaring my little brother

we finally got to ER number two where they gave me a MRI to find out my brain was swelled and had med flight crew come and get me *didn't get to fly since weather was bad so was in a ambulance* 
 
after months of recovery including learning how to walk again in mostly okay - tics, memory issues, severe headaches and if I get a major sinus infection again I could die

115,1g33d4t,AITA for pissing off my sister because my mother decided to help me financially?,"The past few months have been a whirlwind for me [M33]. After moving on from my ex, my current girlfriend [F32] and I decided to get married. Since both of us have been going through tough times and my girlfriend has minimal contact with her family, we opted for a private wedding—no party, reception, or dinner.

Financially, things have been difficult, largely due to bad luck beyond my control. My mom’s [F51] house had become dangerously unlivable, requiring immediate repairs. I also had to replace my car after an accident, as I needed it for work. On top of this, I’m still paying off personal debts after overcoming my alcohol addiction—1.5 years sober now.

Fortunately, my mom and girlfriend get along really well. Despite my initial protests, my mom insisted on gifting us $10,000. This was a huge relief, especially since my girlfriend is unemployed due to severe burnout. The money would help us start setting up our apartment, a much-needed blessing in our situation.

The issue started when my sister [F32], who I’ve never been close with, found out about the gift. Her marriage has been unstable, and she accused me of not being a man, being a drunk like my dad, and being irresponsible. She even said I didn’t care about my mom or my girlfriend.

To give some context: I always suspected I was the favorite growing up. I was raised by a single mom for 20 years, and while I tried to be humble and not ask for much, I helped where I could, like paying the Verizon bill since I was 18. My sister, on the other hand, has always been spoiled, judgmental, and toxic—frequently acting like a know-it-all and making people feel bad. She hasn’t worked in nearly six years, often leaves her child with her mother-in-law, and her marriage is only stable because her husband buys her everything she wants.

I’ve never been great with money, but I don’t blame others for my challenges. Our parents divorced during a pivotal time in my life, and I quickly learned that life could be hard. I worked a low-paying grocery job at 16, went to college until 29, and battled anxiety, OCD, and alcoholism throughout. My dad wasn’t around to teach me much, and my mom was too busy keeping us afloat to guide me financially.

Despite it all, I’ve always had a strong bond with my mom. I’ve helped her improve her English, get a better job, and organize her finances. Our relationship is really solid now.

But my sister’s words still hurt. They sicken me and, unfortunately, make me question myself.

My husband James (48M) never wanted to get married. He made this very clear in every relationship. At 22 he got his girlfriend Jenna pregnant and was overjoyed, but she wanted marriage and he refused so when he got deployed after the baby was born she moved across the country and cut all contact with him.

After that, James being still in the military didn't fight her for custody, but she agreed to let him visit the child whenever he could. He paid well over the child support mandated by law plus expenses, and visited as often as he could. All this has been confirmed to me by other people and I have no reason to doubt it. 

At 32 James had another son with another woman (Lia 46F now), also unmarried, and after that a vasectomy. They separated when this child was 4 and that's when I met my husband. At the time we were both 36 and the kids were 14m (John) and 4m (Jimmy)

I met Lia and Jimmy quite quickly. Lia has an excellent relationship with James and we developed a friendship quite fast, so she was happy to allow me to be involved in Jimmy's life. To this day the three of us and Lia's husband are still good friends and hang out often. 

On the other hand Jenna loathes me because as you can tell from me writing ""my husband"", he went and married me. John, who is 25 now, has a neutral relationship with me. I get the feeling that he'd like me, but he feels like that would be betraying his mom. Anyway he's grown now and we barely see him by his own will (James has always asked him for permission before visiting, and he has never visited us).

Ok the other hand Jimmy is my kid. I might not be his mom, because he already has a great mom, but he is my only child and I swell with pride when he calls me his second mom.

So I was doing my will and I left everything to Jimmy except my half of the house I share with James. This means that over time Jimmy is going to get an ungodly amount of properties because both his mom and I are only children. Meanwhile John will have to share with half sibs and step sibs on his mom's side

So I (21F) made a friend that is a beginner motorcycle rider like myself and we have been wanting to hang out and go on a cruise together but didn’t know where to go or how far out to ride we found a memorial ride that a person was doing for there dad who pass back in 2020 in a motorcycle accident I had explained to my husband (22M) two week before the event that the meet for the ride would be at Buc-ee’s in Denton and would end at the stock yards at a bbq pit to have lunch but I would not be attending the lunch after the ride due to me not having enough money and that since it passes the exit to go home that I would be take the exit and come home instead of the end point at the bbq pit 
fast forward:
Two days before the event he asked how long I will I be out and around what time would I be getting home I told him that I would probably be home around 1 or 2 pm since we don’t ride out until 12pm he said okay I got the kids our son (1 year and 5 months) and our daughter (1 month)
Day of event: I let my husband and babies sleep as I got up and got ready to go for the ride as I am arriving to the location I get a text from my husband saying “40 mins just for that” 
So my friend fills up the gas tank for me and we start going as I was the last one to arrive and there was a lot of traffic at bucees and didn’t want to get long I simply sent a text out my husband that our daughters swing that we ordered for her had been delivered and we went on the ride as we kept going my friend let call her Emma asked me that instead of me missing out on lunch that we could just go to her house and have lunch there since she knew I didn’t have money to go when we stoped at a red light and I showed her what my husband said and asked her do you think I will be able to go she responded with “I don’t think so girly you need to get home” so I did as I told my husband witch was come home when we passed by the exit to our home as I walked through the door I greeted my son and went to hug my husband but he blew pass me which had me thinking he was already upset and I asked him “did you mean 40 minutes away in a good way or a bad way” he started to get upset at me asking me why I came home why I didn’t tell him I was coming home and just repeating himself and saying that I made him upset for asking him if he was meaning the text he sent me in a good way or bad way so AITA?

So I (21F) made a friend that is a beginner motorcycle rider like myself and we have been wanting to hang out and go on a cruise together but didn’t know where to go or how far out to ride we found a memorial ride that a person was doing for there dad who pass back in 2020 in a motorcycle accident I had explained to my husband (22M) two week before the event that the meet for the ride would be at Buc-ee’s in Denton and would end at the stock yards at a bbq pit to have lunch but I would not be attending the lunch after the ride due to me not having enough money and that since it passes the exit to go home that I would be take the exit and come home instead of the end point at the bbq pit 
fast forward:
Two days before the event he asked how long I will I be out and around what time would I be getting home I told him that I would probably be home around 1 or 2 pm since we don’t ride out until 12pm he said okay I got the kids our son (1 year and 5 months) and our daughter (1 month)
Day of event: I let my husband and babies sleep as I got up and got ready to go for the ride as I am arriving to the location I get a text from my husband saying “40 mins just for that” 
So my friend fills up the gas tank for me and we start going as I was the last one to arrive and there was a lot of traffic at bucees and didn’t want to get long I simply sent a text out my husband that our daughters swing that we ordered for her had been delivered and we went on the ride as we kept going my friend let call her Emma asked me that instead of me missing out on lunch that we could just go to her house and have lunch there since she knew I didn’t have money to go when we stoped at a red light and I showed her what my husband said and asked her do you think I will be able to go she responded with “I don’t think so girly you need to get home” so I did as I told my husband witch was come home when we passed by the exit to our home as I walked through the door I greeted my son and went to hug my husband but he blew pass me which had me thinking he was already upset and I asked him “did you mean 40 minutes away in a good way or a bad way” he started to get upset at me asking me why I came home why I didn’t tell him I was coming home and just repeating himself and saying that I made him upset for asking him if he was meaning the text he sent me in a good way or bad way so AITA? 


UPDATE: 
Apparently this was such a horrible way of communicating to him and he got upset for me thinking he was upset and has kicked me and our kids out going as far as telling me that he thinks that they are not his kids (he is my first and only relationship ever) and has wants nothing to do with do with me and our kids I came to my moms after he took the car and left all night and when and after I came to my moms house he went home and changed the locks ",0.0,0.9680901169776917,1,0

(She wants to be a SAHM, btw)","I own a small video production business, but right now I only work about 25 hours a week. We are breaking even financially, so I technically could keep living this way if I was comfortable with living paycheck to paycheck, but I want more for our lives than living paycheck to paycheck can provide. We want to buy a house soon, but I have nothing left over to save for a down payment. 

I’m constantly stressed that I’m not doing enough to grow my business. We have only one retainer client, and if that client ever stopped working with us, we would have no money coming in. We also have very little savings in terms of an emergency fund.

I’d honestly love to work between 40 and 45 hours a week so that I can find more ways to grow my business, but the problem is that my wife thinks that a business owner shouldn’t have to work like a normal 40 hour a week employee, and that the idea of a 40 hour work week is arbitrary. And while that may be true, in general, the fact is that our business is not growing and is really vulnerable to failure unless I can spend more time working “on” the business, and not just “in” the business.

She gets really worn out, watching our 2 kids (both under 5yo), and feels like I’m unsupportive whenever I express that I want to be spending more time working, as opposed to helping her out at home. I feel guilty every time I spend a full workday actually working (8:30-4). I try to explain to her that if the business fails, I’ll have to get a normal job and I’ll be spending double the time away from her that I’m currently am, but that doesn’t work with her. 

I do understand how hard it is to be a stay at home wife and mother. Being a Stay at home, mom was always her dream, and I wasn’t always sure that I could provide that for her. I feel very fortunate that I can provide that for her now, but I don’t know how much longer I can do that if she won’t let me work. And I’m not asking to work 70 hours a week like many business owners work, I’m asking to work 40 to 45 hours. 

So bottom line, am I asking too much of my wife to expect her to be alone with our kids for 40 hours a week? I’ve been dealing with this for three years, and want to know if I am the asshole.

I noticed that she was hanging out a lot more with my brother than me, I thought this was weird since she has joked before about liking him but I never thought it was fr. I kept trying to talk to Ellie to which she would respond “not right now, (brother) wants to do this w me”. It was annoying, and my brother told me that it was making him confused so i sent a text to my bf about it. The text read: “Ellie keeps hanging out with (brother), im bored because she doesn’t want to do stuff with me”. I then put my phone down and went to the bathroom, and a text back from him that read “thats so annoying, why would she do that” popped up on the home page of my phone which I had left on the counter near her. Ellie saw this text and got curious, so that night when I was asleep she opened my phone and read all of our texts, screenshotting and airdropping them to herself. I am upset about this as I had been telling my boyfriend directly above that text about something very personal to me about my mental health that I didn’t want people seeing, and I later learned from a mutual friend (who has since cut ties with Ellie) that she saw a screenshot of that private conversation in Ellie’s camera roll when they hung out. She also told this friend that it was her who went on my phone, and the friend told me. I confronted her about this but she denied it.

For the rest of the weekend she acted as if everything was okay, and it was the next week on Thursday that Ellie told me what she had found- however, she lied and told me someone else had gone on my phone, screenshotted those texts and sent them to her during the week.

123,1g3u95q,"AITA for snapping at my friend because she’s saying I changed myself for a guy?
","I’m F25 and have been seeing my boyfriend (M25) for about a year. 

My entire friend circle is in very long-term relationships, and for most of this time I was single and not looking, so me being in a relationship is still relatively new for this group.

My boyfriend doesn’t drink alcohol because he doesn’t like the way it makes him feel and he feels it just isn’t worth any health impacts. He has no issue going out to drinking-centered places like breweries, wineries, cocktail bars, etc, but just gets a mocktail or something else non-alcoholic. I’ve never been a huge drinker but I’ve always drank socially.

My friends thought it was weird that he doesn’t drink (they’re accepting of people who are sober for substance abuse reasons, but think it’s weird that he doesn’t drink for health reasons). He’s never *once* complained or showed any disapproval over me or anyone else drinking around him, he just doesn’t want to do it himself. For my birthday, he bought me a bottle of a nice local wine I’d been wanting to try. 

I love mixology and making fun cocktails so I’ve gotten really into making creative mocktails so I can share with him. When I told my best friend Amy F25 she said it seems like he was pressuring me into drinking less. I said I don’t feel that he’s applied any pressure in that regard, but she made it clear she did not approve.

I found I enjoyed making mocktails just as much as cocktails, and eventually I jumped on the ‘sober curious’ research train and decided to do an experiment and stop drinking for a month to see if I felt any different. It ended up making a big enough difference in my mental and physical health (mostly mental) that I came to the conclusion to pretty much stop drinking. I’ll still drink every now and again at events or vacations or whatever, but it’s just not worth it to me in my daily life anymore after realizing how much of a difference not drinking made. I’ve also made faster progress on my fitness goals, so overall just a net positive.

Amy in particular has not been happy with this and would try to talk me into ordering a cocktail or whatever when we’re out, and sends me links to random articles about drinking actually improving mental health, misc articles/reels about the benefits of alcohol, etc. I just kind of laughed it off because I understand that she misses getting buzzed together because it was fun.

I was out with the girls the other night and Amy started talking about how she never knew that I was the type of girl to change herself for a guy. I asked what she meant and she started talking about how I stopped drinking because my boyfriend doesn’t drink. I told her that she knew very well that I stopped because I felt better when I didn’t drink and she made it clear she didn’t believe me and kept going. Eventually I snapped and said I’m done with the topic and if she wants to continue discussing it I would leave.

124,1g3u1tl,AITA for Running Into My Friends Garage?,"Hi everyone, I need some outside perspective on a situation that’s been weighing on me.

For context, I’ve been friends with someone (28F) for 10 years, and earlier this year, I was one of her bridesmaids. Another mutual friend (29F), also a bridesmaid, invited a group of us to celebrate her birthday at a beach house that belongs to my friend’s parents. I had some anxiety about going because there are a few people in the group I don’t get along with, but I’ve been in treatment for depression and anxiety since my friend’s wedding and was doing much better. This was my first group event since my major depressive episode, and I was excited to feel more like myself.

The weekend was fantastic—no drama, and I felt good the whole time. I didn’t have to fake anything or feel like a downer. It was a big deal for me. But on the last day, I had to leave earlier than everyone else to get to my mom’s birthday. I asked one of the girls I’m not close with to move her car, and while pulling out, I accidentally nicked the garage trim with my new car, damaging it and pulling up a piece of trim from the garage. I was mortified.

I immediately parked, went back inside, and tried to stay calm. I told the birthday girl what happened, and she reassured me that it was okay and just an accident. I texted my good friend (the one whose parents own the house), apologizing profusely and letting her know I’d pay for any repairs. She responded later saying she’d talk to her parents and let me know what’s next. I messaged her again to apologize, offered to personally handle the repairs, and even reached out to her parents and husband to apologize as well. They were all understanding, and I thought things were okay. Then, a week later, I messaged her like normal about something unrelated, and she said she needed space and asked me not to reach out to her till she was ready to talk because she was still upset about the garage situation. I was shocked because she hadn’t responded to my last apology, but I thought that was normal since she’s not always quick to respond.

It’s been a month since I last heard from her, and I’m confused. I reached out to the birthday girl, and she was surprised by how things have played out too. I’m feeling guilty and unsure if I’m in the wrong here.

126,1g3toel,AITA for not paying my older sister for bringing me to and from work?,"I (17f) got a job in April at this restaurant that's a 5 minute drive and 30 minute walk away from my house. My older sister (18F) graduated in 2024 and isn't in college and has no job. My dad bought her a car (keep this in mind) a couple months before she graduated. The car is paid off, so she doesn't have to make any payments on it, and my dad pays for her gas.

 When I started working, we came up with an agreement that I would drive to work in her car with her in the passenger seat so l could practice my driving, and in return I would pay her every other week for gas. My sister is very petty and we argue a lot, so as soon as I said something she didn't like, she stopped letting me drive to work.

Even after the fact, I still continued to pay her. After a while, I stopped paying her because she didn't keep up her end of the deal and I was tired of it. She constantly badgers me about paying her, even though like I said, the drive is 5 minutes away, and I only work maybe three days a week, four at most. Now obviously, I could walk to work, which I do when I have the time to. My shifts start at 4.

I ride the bus from school and I usually get off the bus around 3:30, and with the walk home being about five minutes plus me having to change into my work clothes, I genuinely do not have the time to walk to work after school, so it's not like I'm being unreasonable about her bringing me to work. She has had every opportunity to get a job and pay for her own gas, which l've reminded her about all the time.

She says l'm spoiled and entitled for not paying her, when in reality I would be happy to pay her if she actually let me drive like we agreed.
In my head it's like, if someone else is paying for your gas (my father) and you have no car payments to make, plus no job, rent, or bills to pay, essentially you're living for free. Why would I have to pay her when my dad pays for her gas?

Personally I think it's ridiculous to even charge your younger siblings for rides in the first place when it isn't even an inconvenience to you. In my own opinion I think it should be done regardless. I couldn't walk home anyway even if I wanted to. I get off around 8:30-9:30PM and the area I live in barely has any streetlights around outside.
Everyone uses their high beams because it's genuinely so dark. 

My coworkers refuse to let a teenage girl walk alone for 30 minutes in that, and they always wait outside with me until my ride gets there. My sister stays at home all day doing nothing and complains about having to drive me, when in reality l'm the one who's supposed to be driving anyway.

Please let me know what you guys think about this situation.

AITA?

I (17f) got a job in April at this restaurant that's a 5 minute drive and 30 minute walk away from my house. My older sister (18F) graduated in 2024 and isn't in college and has no job. My dad bought her a car (keep this in mind) a couple months before she graduated. The car is paid off, so she doesn't have to make any payments on it, and my dad pays for her gas.

 When I started working, we came up with an agreement that I would drive to work in her car with her in the passenger seat so l could practice my driving, and in return I would pay her every other week for gas. My sister is very petty and we argue a lot, so as soon as I said something she didn't like, she stopped letting me drive to work.

Even after the fact, I still continued to pay her. After a while, I stopped paying her because she didn't keep up her end of the deal and I was tired of it. She constantly badgers me about paying her, even though like I said, the drive is 5 minutes away, and I only work maybe three days a week, four at most. Now obviously, I could walk to work, which I do when I have the time to. My shifts start at 4.

I ride the bus from school and I usually get off the bus around 3:30, and with the walk home being about five minutes plus me having to change into my work clothes, I genuinely do not have the time to walk to work after school, so it's not like I'm being unreasonable about her bringing me to work. She has had every opportunity to get a job and pay for her own gas, which l've reminded her about all the time.

She says l'm spoiled and entitled for not paying her, when in reality I would be happy to pay her if she actually let me drive like we agreed.
In my head it's like, if someone else is paying for your gas (my father) and you have no car payments to make, plus no job, rent, or bills to pay, essentially you're living for free. Why would I have to pay her when my dad pays for her gas?

Personally I think it's ridiculous to even charge your younger siblings for rides in the first place when it isn't even an inconvenience to you. In my own opinion I think it should be done regardless. I couldn't walk home anyway even if I wanted to. I get off around 8:30-9:30PM and the area I live in barely has any streetlights around outside.
Everyone uses their high beams because it's genuinely so dark. 

My coworkers refuse to let a teenage girl walk alone for 30 minutes in that, and they always wait outside with me until my ride gets there. My sister stays at home all day doing nothing and complains about having to drive me, when in reality l'm the one who's supposed to be driving anyway.

Please let me know what you guys think about this situation.

127,1g3tbt4,AITA for telling a joke to my schoolmate?,"I (18M) am currently a third year High School student, and along with two of my friends - ""B"" and ""C"" - were known to be ""problem children"" at our school - although we only do what they do because we simply like to joke around and have fun to escape the perpetually boring school life.

While me and my friends were on the rooftop of our school, I saw one of my girl schoolmate (lets just call her ""E"") who is just chilling up there and getting some fresh air.

Me and my friends approached ""E"" and asked if she knows another schoolmate ""M"". It looks like ""E"" has known ""M"" for a long time now. After that, I jokingly asked her if she was also a guy, because if ""E"" knew ""M"" for that long already, she should have already known that with regards to ""M, right?

Apparently, I was not aware that ""E"" had no idea regarding this, and I accidentally outed ""M""'s deepest, darkest secret in the process. I was expecting that ""E"" would play around with the joke, but she was instead shocked by what I said, so I immediately apologized for it. But then, it looks like my joke was of bad taste enough to the point that my friend ""B"" asked me to cut it out. However, it looks like ""E"" was visibly distraught by what I said despite our apologies.

I was just joking around like what I always do when I am with my friends - I meant no harm!!! Which is why I said something like that, but I had no idea that ""E"" was not aware of it this entire time so the joke ended up rubbing her the wrong way. Ssooo....

128,1g3sgqm,AITA for embarrassing and causing trouble for my grandmother?,"I(14F)am being left alone with my grandmother(67F) as my mom(47F) heads to another state for work. My mom is leaving tomorrow and today I have club practice. Me and my mom were shopping for food for me to have since my grandma can't drive. 

My grandma earlier drank up almost half of my sweet tea and we just bought it that day, nobody not even me had some yet. So today we were finished with our shopping. So I said, ""let's go grandma it's time to go."" She said she need to get some tea and I said we already have some. And I realize oh she wanted her own jug and I said never mind you wanted your own. And jokingly I said yeah get your own I don't want you drinking up all mines!

A simple joke.

My mom forgot her headphones and needs to go buy them so we went down to the electronics section and we called her and told her we were there. Yet she checked out her stuff and waits by the car for almost 20 minutes. 

When we got home, I left the car and took the groceries in and I was getting ready to cook some shrimp and then she started talking about how it's my fault and started saying I told her to go outside and to leave. 

I just went back to the car because my mom was in there. Then she started to follow me and say I was a bad granddaughter and called me mouth. Then she brought up how I embarrassed her in the Walmart and I was rude, which she never brought up until now.

My mom is mad at my grandma but tells me just not to joke with her like that anymore. My mom is thinking about just taking me and I want her too. Whenever she's not here, my grandma says nasty stuff about me and follows me around the house.

My grandma thinks I'm AH and will definitely tell the rest of the family I'm an AH and will frame my mom as one too.

131,1g3sfal,AITA for ignoring my father?,"Let’s take a time trip to the past real quick. Around 4 years ago it came to surface that my father was cheating on my mother, they didn’t have the best relationship.

They were fighting almost every day, one day my father decided to propose to try and smooth their rocky road. (They had been dating 10 years at this point so they considered themselves married already)

After I went on a work trip with my father, there was apparent signs of him cheating on my mother but I ignored them. Everything smoothed out for a couple weeks so I thought everything was good, until my mother found out he was on dating sights.

They broke up and it absolutely broke my mother, I remember one final night before we moved away, they had a massive fight, she destroyed her garden that she had built throughout the years. 

I don’t know exactly what happened since I was inside listening to it, I could hear things being thrown and then my father yelling in pain. I believe she threw something at him.

We moved across the country the next day, as my mothers family was there and she needed the support. (mental and financial)

During the first year I was forced to have an audio call with my father once a month so he would pay child support. It’s recently come to my attention that he never paid a dime even though I was forced to talk to him.

I was turning 12 at this time so I was already entering my rebellious stage, I didn’t want anything to do with either of my parents, especially him. The mental stress I went through caused lash outs and fights that weren’t normal between me and my mother. 

It also took a physical toll on me, i gained weight and started wetting the bed again. (I am still embarrassed to admit it, but I had bladder control issues until I was 8, so starting again had a big impact)

Bringing it back to the present, for the past year I tried picking contact back up with him. He put no effort into talking to me, I had to carry the conversations just for him to say “k” to almost everything.

So I stopped around 4 months ago, and he just started sending me messages again, wishing me happy birthday and happy thanksgiving. He’s telling me he misses and loves me, even sending me photos of the beach saying he’s thinking of me. (He knows my favorite place is the beach as I grew up by the water)

132,1g3s5vz,AITA for refusing to switch seats with my girlfriend on a plane to make her more comfortable?,"This past weekend, I 23M and my girlfriend “Julie” 24F took a weekend trip. We’re both students so we had to budget where we could, so we bought basic economy tickets and just took whatever seats they assigned us. They were both middle seats, which was expected, but when we boarded the plane home, it was obvious that one seat was much better than the other.

Julie was assigned to a seat between a morbidly obese man who was spilling into her seat, and a woman on her other side who wasn’t as huge but was still quite big. My seat was next to two normal sized people. The thing is, I’m pretty big–6’5” and 220 with broad shoulders. Julie isn’t tiny herself–she’s 5’10 and 165–but obviously she’s much smaller than me. Julie immediately asked if we could switch seats, to which I said no. I knew Julie would be uncomfortable in the seats, but I don’t even think I could fit between the passengers on either side of her. After some arguing back and forth, Julie sighed and went to her seat.

I thought it wasn’t a big deal, but Julie was very cold to me when we landed. I offered to get us dinner on the way out but she said her back hurt from the flight and she wanted to lay down.

135,1g3r8yz,AITA for confronting my friend (24 m) for his behavior toward his gf (23 f) on my birthday night out?,"My friends planned a night out for my (26 f) birthday. My friend, Lauren, and I were getting ready she was venting about recent arguments she and my friend, Connor, have been having. Lauren and Connor are dating, about 3 months. She said he’s been picking fights over stupid things, like how she makes macaroni or how messy her car is. Always ending w/her appearance, saying she needs to lose weight, and she’s “hoeing” around when she’s out w/her friends.

Connor was cheated on in the past so he can get paranoid. He also just got a new job and house so he’s a bit stressed rn. 

Fast forward, Connor forgot his belt so he and Lauren leave to get it. My fiancé and I waited for 40 minutes for them to get back. He lives 10 minutes away. They get back and it’s apparent they were fighting so Lauren and I decide to take a separate car to chat on our way to the first stop. She told me Connor started yelling at her when they left because she had a fast food bag in her car and she “needs to stop eating that shit because she’s not gonna lose any weight that way” and “she put him in a bad mood so they weren’t going to go out anymore” and a whole argument ensued. I told her stress can make people lash out and try to have a calm conversation with him about what he’s been saying to her and how it makes her feel. 

We get to the first stop and he is completely ignoring her. My fiancé tried to make the best out of it and start a good night for my birthday but Connor was making everyone uncomfortable. So we left for the second stop hoping my fiancé could talk to him on the way. Lauren and I were in the parking lot waiting for them while our other friends were already inside. Connor called Lauren and this is exactly how the call went. “We broke down and it’s your fucking fault because you had to take a separate car to talk shit about me and now you ruined OP’s birthday. I hope you’re happy.” (My fiancé offered to drive but Connor was adamant they take the truck)

I answered before Lauren could. I said “1. how on God’s green earth is it Lauren’s fault that the truck broke down? 2. My birthday is not ruined and if it was it wouldn’t be Lauren’s fault. And 3. Stop being an asshole and do not speak to her or anyone like that again.”  He said why the fuck am I on speaker? And what if I tell your fiancé what you just said?  I told him to go right ahead and he did. I heard my fiancé in the background say “she’s a grown woman and I support her”. Connor hung up on us. 

But we drove to where they were and Connor stomped to the car yelling at Lauren. In the midst of their fight he told me that I need to stay out of their business and had no right to speak to him like that. I said “like how you speak to Lauren?”

That was last weekend and we haven’t heard from him since. I’ve heard from Lauren saying she’s fine and they talked everything out. I understand that I may have over stepped when he was on the phone. AITA for confronting Connor for how he was behaving toward Lauren?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-14,"AITA for confronting my friend (24 m) for his behavior toward his gf (23 f) on my birthday night out? My friends planned a night out for my (26 f) birthday. My friend, Lauren, and I were getting ready she was venting about recent arguments she and my friend, Connor, have been having. Lauren and Connor are dating, about 3 months. She said he’s been picking fights over stupid things, like how she makes macaroni or how messy her car is. Always ending w/her appearance, saying she needs to lose weight, and she’s “hoeing” around when she’s out w/her friends.

Connor was cheated on in the past so he can get paranoid. He also just got a new job and house so he’s a bit stressed rn. 

Fast forward, Connor forgot his belt so he and Lauren leave to get it. My fiancé and I waited for 40 minutes for them to get back. He lives 10 minutes away. They get back and it’s apparent they were fighting so Lauren and I decide to take a separate car to chat on our way to the first stop. She told me Connor started yelling at her when they left because she had a fast food bag in her car and she “needs to stop eating that shit because she’s not gonna lose any weight that way” and “she put him in a bad mood so they weren’t going to go out anymore” and a whole argument ensued.

136,1g3r78z,WIBTA for not going to a concert with my friend,"AITA for not going to a concert with my friend



Hi, I (15f) have been friends with someone I’ll call Claire (15f) for about 3-4 years. I consider me and her best friends and I think we are the closest friends in our friend group. Now, I’ve been a fan of a music artist since 2018ish. I’ve always wanted to see them in concert. This artist is going on tour and I somehow managed to get two tickets in a good spot and was planning to go to with my brother.

Claire became a fan when I reintroduced her to the artist when they released their new album. I told Claire I’m going and we started talking about us two going (I don’t remember who brought up the idea). I’m not that close to my brother anymore since we are a couple years apart and he’s an adult now. I told Claire that I would ask my parents if I could go with her but I talked to my mom and realized I would enjoy it more if I went with my brother since we don’t see each other as much anymore. I miss my brother and I honestly just want to do anything with him. I haven’t told Claire this, I told her my parents are uncomfortable with us going alone which is true but I told her I wanted go with her. I don’t want to hurt her feelings and tell her I don’t want to go with her.

I chose to go with my brother and I thought it would be fine until the issue began. I became friends with a girl I liked and we’re quickly becoming good friends. She is older than me but it’s not awkward at all and I would say that her and Claire are my only real friends (I have others but none I can really trust). This new friend who I’ll call Emily, likes the artist and I think she would like to go. I considered going with her instead but I chose not to since I want to go with my brother and I would feel bad for Claire. 

Turns out, my brother was complaining about having to go with me to the concert and he hasn’t began to figure out how to schedule around his job. I get his job is important but he’s known about the concert since around April. I was upset at this because we haven’t done anything together in months and I just miss my brother and wanted to do something fun with him since he’s moving out soon. I don’t think I want to go with him anymore because I’m upset. I don’t know why, but I don’t really want to go with Claire. I really wish I had a reason but I don’t. I know it’s shitty to want to go with Emily but I think I might do that. Emily doesn’t know I’m going to the concert and I can’t talk to anyone about this because the the people that I’m close to are all biased.

I really like Emily and I think she likes me too and I think this would be a good way to get closer. I don’t want to prioritize Emily over Claire and if Claire finds out I went with Emily it would be horrible since she doesn’t like when I pick Emily over her which is 100% valid. I know I should go with my brother but I don’t want to fight for his attention anymore. I’ll probably deleting this soon. If anyone has advice I would really appreciate it and it would mean a lot.

Recently our kids had a day off school and my mom and stepdad had planned to watch the kids, but they knew in advance they were getting dropped off later in the morning than usual. Husband (J) was about an hour later than they expected so they texted to ask where he was. He replied his scheduled had suddenly opened up and he was able to take the day off work, but he was still going to bring the kids over. He was going to use his day off to mow grass and run errands. They then tell him to not bother bringing them over at all. Keep in mind, our kids had the afternoon planned with their grandparents including lunch at a fave restaurant and boomers just cancelled it all out of spite. OK, my husband failed to communicate the change in plans, jerk move, but why punish and disappoint our kids for it? Then I get an email screed about how ""we aren't a family anymore and we take advantage of them, and they're just babysitters.""

J is doing better now and I promised we would spend more weekend time with them.

Then I get a reply ""well, it's not really that, it's just that you haven't been inviting us to birthday parties for the kids or anything."" Huh?

138,1g3qi1i,AITA NOT LETTING MY FATHER MOVE IN WITH US,"My husband P (29) and I, D (29), have been married for almost five years. This year, we decided to start a family. A couple of months ago, my father A (63) called P on a Friday to inform him that my mother had received the house in their divorce. He asked if he could move in with us temporarily, as he had nowhere else to go. P said he wanted to discuss it with me first, but he didn't see a problem, especially since it would only be until the end of the year.
That Friday night, P took me out for dinner, and we talked it over. We agreed to let my father move in. On Sunday, my father visited, and when I asked for details about the divorce, he began talking about wanting to build a log home, which would take two years. I was taken aback; I thought he would only be staying with us until the end of the year. I expressed my concerns, and he said he could either invest his money in our house or improve someone else's home.
Despite my reservations, he offered to help us with renovations, like fixing the pool and installing solar panels. He then mentioned he had already packed a few things to leave at our place and planned to bring more during the week. I asked him to give us a week to clear out our spare room to make space for him.
The next day, my father called, saying he was on his way with his car full of small items. I told him he needed to respect our boundaries and wait until we were ready. Two hours later, P called to say my father wanted to drop off some items. I was furious and insisted that he shouldn't bring anything until we were prepared. Thankfully, P stood firm and told him it could wait.
When I got home from work, P suggested we go to a hardware store to buy paint and start preparing the room. We spent the next two days painting and organizing our things. The room we were fixing up was intended to be P’s office, which would eventually be the nursery.
On Wednesday night, while we were painting, my father called to say we could put everything on hold—my mother had not agreed to the terms of the divorce and was going to fight further, so he wouldn’t be moving out after all.
Fast forward to today, my father called again, saying they had a new contract, and my mother would still get the house. He wanted to know if it would still be okay for him to move in with us. At this point, I felt overwhelmed and frustrated. He had three months to sort things out, and we had already started moving P’s office into that room.

139,1g3q9qd,AITA for disrespecting my BIL for ruining my mental state for two years? ,"Am I overreacting? my brother in law is demanding that I remove my FB post where he is indirectly mentioned

Sorry, I am very nervous now and I might mistype/not be able to formulate sentences properly. It's going to be long.  
Since I met my now husband's brother, two years ago, my life and mental state changed for the worse.  
He always came out of his way to insult me, my country, culture, and family (even without knowing anything about any of these). It just looked like he enjoyed looking superior, rich, and important among ""losers"" as he referred to everyone around me.   
Some things that he has told me:  
""you and my brother will end this very badly cause you are not rich and you can't travel freely. This was a stupid idea"" (I am Georgian and my husband is from one of the EU countries)   
""There are rich and successful people here but because you surround us with the poor, we spend too much time with losers""  
""Oh, your mother married when she was 41? So she was an outdated woman and had only leftover men?""  
""You guys are passport hunters. And ugly. I'd never date in Georgia"".  

""you have no friends, looks like you arrived yesterday in this city. You are not like X person who's very respectable and everyone knows her"".

And tons of other things.  
At the same time, he created prejudice about me in my husband's home country, with his family members and friends.  
When we got married, my parents bought a golden ring for my husband according to our traditions and in my special beautiful times he comes out and says: ""It's so stupid of them. It must have cost them the entire year's income"".

It greatly affected our relationship with my partner. Having these encounters always led to me reacting in a way that was used against me and he easily labeled me as ""emotional"" and someone who always finds ""beef"".

A few months ago he started a relationship with a Russian woman in Georgia who was married and immediately left her husband after she met him.  
I met her three times and none of these meetings were nice.   
In Georgia, due to our ongoing Russian occupation, we are very skeptical about those who come to Georgia.   
Given the fact that she left Russia due to sanctions + met a man and left her partner immediately for him + her liking a person like him didn't look like a great combo but when I met her, I realized that my intuition was right.  
She was very cold to me, almost rude but I didn't care.   
But our last meeting was when I realized that I never wanted them in my life, ever.  
My husband and I got married in June and a week after I got invited to my brother-in-law's party in my city. Out of politeness, I agreed. She was there too.  
Firstly, I never got congratulated on my marriage, which is highly rude of her. Even strangers raised glasses for us on that evening and she was looking at me with a disgusted face.  
She rudely interrupted me many times, opposed me about everything, and Defended her boyfriend while he was saying cringe stuff like ""people like me should have kids 'cause I am incredibly clever and rich"".   
Now they are getting married in Georgia :) While she lives in Serbia because she ""feels better with Slavic brothers"". Somehow always finds content to mock our traditions and religious gatherings and so on. Typical colonialist mentality.  
And I posted on my Facebook which I use mostly for posing about social-political stuff.  
In that post, I talk about how my mother almost died in a bunker during the Russian occupation 30 years ago, what she went through, and so on. In the end, I mention how ironic life is sometimes that the citizens of our enemy country get to use our services.  I know someone from a certain EU country who is marrying a Russian woman in Georgia and, sadly, we give Russian citizens this uncontrollable access to the West.  
 She stalked me and translated and read my long Georgian text.  
And she is going nuts, and so is he.  
It is a complicated situation because now I live with my husband, in his parents' empty house in that EU country and the BIL is visiting.  
And he is demanding that I remove that post or ""he will show this to his parents"" because it is disrespectful and it's an attack on an innocent person like his fiance.  
And I am not removing it. I even feel disrespected by being asked to.  
I think he deserves to taste the s\*it that he was feeding me with for so long.

But what do you think? Am I overreacting?

Sorry, I am very nervous now and I might mistype/not be able to formulate sentences properly. It's going to be long.  
Since I met my now husband's brother, two years ago, my life and mental state changed for the worse.  
He always came out of his way to insult me, my country, culture, and family (even without knowing anything about any of these). It just looked like he enjoyed looking superior, rich, and important among ""losers"" as he referred to everyone around me.   
Some things that he has told me:  
""you and my brother will end this very badly cause you are not rich and you can't travel freely. This was a stupid idea"" (I am Georgian and my husband is from one of the EU countries)   
""There are rich and successful people here but because you surround us with the poor, we spend too much time with losers""  
""Oh, your mother married when she was 41? So she was an outdated woman and had only leftover men?""  
""You guys are passport hunters. And ugly. I'd never date in Georgia"".  

""you have no friends, looks like you arrived yesterday in this city. You are not like X person who's very respectable and everyone knows her"".

And tons of other things.  
At the same time, he created prejudice about me in my husband's home country, with his family members and friends.  
When we got married, my parents bought a golden ring for my husband according to our traditions and in my special beautiful times he comes out and says: ""It's so stupid of them. It must have cost them the entire year's income"".

It greatly affected our relationship with my partner. Having these encounters always led to me reacting in a way that was used against me and he easily labeled me as ""emotional"" and someone who always finds ""beef"".

A few months ago he started a relationship with a Russian woman in Georgia who was married and immediately left her husband after she met him.  
I met her three times and none of these meetings were nice.   
In Georgia, due to our ongoing Russian occupation, we are very skeptical about those who come to Georgia.   
Given the fact that she left Russia due to sanctions + met a man and left her partner immediately for him + her liking a person like him didn't look like a great combo but when I met her, I realized that my intuition was right.  
She was very cold to me, almost rude but I didn't care.   
But our last meeting was when I realized that I never wanted them in my life, ever.  
My husband and I got married in June and a week after I got invited to my brother-in-law's party in my city. Out of politeness, I agreed. She was there too.  
Firstly, I never got congratulated on my marriage, which is highly rude of her. Even strangers raised glasses for us on that evening and she was looking at me with a disgusted face.  
She rudely interrupted me many times, opposed me about everything, and Defended her boyfriend while he was saying cringe stuff like ""people like me should have kids 'cause I am incredibly clever and rich"".   
Now they are getting married in Georgia :) While she lives in Serbia because she ""feels better with Slavic brothers"". Somehow always finds content to mock our traditions and religious gatherings and so on. Typical colonialist mentality.  
And I posted on my Facebook which I use mostly for posing about social-political stuff.  
In that post, I talk about how my mother almost died in a bunker during the Russian occupation 30 years ago, what she went through, and so on. In the end, I mention how ironic life is sometimes that the citizens of our enemy country get to use our services.  I know someone from a certain EU country who is marrying a Russian woman in Georgia and, sadly, we give Russian citizens this uncontrollable access to the West.  
 She stalked me and translated and read my long Georgian text.  
And she is going nuts, and so is he.  
It is a complicated situation because now I live with my husband, in his parents' empty house in that EU country and the BIL is visiting.  
And he is demanding that I remove that post or ""he will show this to his parents"" because it is disrespectful and it's an attack on an innocent person like his fiance.  
And I am not removing it. I even feel disrespected by being asked to.  
I think he deserves to taste the s\*it that he was feeding me with for so long.

But what do you think? Am I overreacting?  
I am alone here, without friends.  
Even my husband is not on my side *in* *this.*  
*Thank* *you* *all* *in* *advance.*",,0.010043105110526085,0,0

For context, my mom stopped celebrating it two years ago because of “religious reasons” but told me last year on halloween that we could celebrate this year.

Just 20 minutes ago I asked her if we could celebrate this year, that I wanted to go out and wear a costume and stuff. My older sister (F21) agreed as well.

She got angry at the both of us. She took my computer and started searching through it, all while telling me that she’s tired of taking care of me, that I should move out with my sister if I wanna agree with her so bad, and a bunch of other things.

She pretends not to remember what she told me last year, but it’s hard to know if she really does or not.

142,1g3p066,AITA for calling my wife crazy,"I [35M] realize that calling your wife [36F] crazy is a bit of a faux pas, but I genuinely think I was justified here.  My wife is pregnant with our second child and our first just turned two.

Today while I was working (from home), my wife asked me to come down and help her with something urgent.  I come downstairs to find my 2 year old son has got a bunch of those spike ball shaped burrs in his hair while playing outside.  After discussing it with my wife we decide to cut his hair to get them out.

I cut his hair just at the back of his head where his hair reaches his shoulders.  I try my best to clean it up and make it even, but my two year old is not the most cooperative.  Ultimately it looks a little rough, but only around the back of his neck and I tell my wife I can clean it up next time he takes a bath as it will be easier with wet hair.  Note his entire head of hair looks exactly the same as before, but the back of his neck above his shoulders is uneven.

My wife proceeds to freak out that I have ruined our sons hair, accuses me of being a liar as I apparently overstated my hair cutting abilities, and says that we will need to get him a professional hair cut.

At this point I say that I need to go back to work, and my wife continues to yell at me.  I set a boundary that I am not going to continue talking about this with her.  She responds by continuing to push the subject and saying any mother would be this upset about this happening.  I say she is being a lunatic and needs to calm down, and proceed to go back upstairs and continue working.

Then my wife cancelled our afternoon plans, including a doctors appointment (which I took off work to go to with her) and proceeds to take off to her mother's house.

I realize I probably did not handle this in the best way, but my wife was yelling at me over a collaborative decision we made, and acting as if I was not being empathetic, when she is the one who initiated the name calling.
