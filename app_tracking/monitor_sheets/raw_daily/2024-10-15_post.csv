0,1g3yqhc,AITA for calling my sister selfish and immature? ,"For context, about 3.5 years ago my sister came out as transgender (m to f) and moved out of the house less than 24h later. She refused to tell my mom or dad where she was living and expected me to keep the secret. My parents knew she came out and accepted her fully right out of the gate, no questions asked, and were confused that she didn’t want them to know when she lived. Eventually, she let my mom know where she was living and now they have a great relationship. I kept my promise and never told my parents or anyone where she was living. Throughout these 3.5 years my dad has been extremely respectful of her privacy and her wishes to not have a relationship; ofc he still loves her and will text her occasionally to say happy birthday, how is school going, etc. to which my sister will send a thumbs up as a response. To be clear, my dad is respecting her boundaries although he doesn’t understand why my sister thinks he is not accepting of her. 

This thanksgiving weekend my sister came back home to visit and as usual, expects my dad to be out of his own house the entire duration of her visit. My dad has been staying at a hotel and truly doesn’t mind as he wants to respect her wishes. 

I am bothered by this and think it is stupid that he should have to move out of his house every time she visits, specifically because my sister refuses to talk about or explain her reasoning for hating my dad.

1,1g3v6k5,AITA for asking my friend to gender me correctly in French?,"Both my friend and I are French Candians, though my friend rarely speaks it anymore outside of when he is with his family. French, unlike English, is a gendered language and when my friend talks about me he'll refer to me as his ""ami"" which is the masculine for friend instead of ""amie"" when texting his family and will use masculine words when talking about me to them. I find this especially rubs me the wrong way as I am trans and it's just something he could do to be nice. 

I asked him if he would just make an effort to not screw that up, especially when talking to others, as it really bums me out when he does it and I know he doesn't mean to offend me. However, his response was that he doesn't care and neither should I and that really put me off. According to him he is just bad at grammar in French and would screw that up for a cis person as well. Again, I just told him it would really mean a lot if he could remember to gender me correctly and he again just deflected by saying that he isn't good at grammar. 

This ended up frustrating me and I told him that this was equivalent to him consistently misgendering me in English which isn't something he does and I'd like him to at least try to do the same in French. His response was that I need to calm down and that I'm being over dramatic over this. He's made it clear that he doesn't want to even try as he says it's too hard and that I should just drop it as he rarely ever speaks French anyway. He told me I'm making mountains out of mole hills and told me I need to calm down about this.

2,1g4lpjv,AITA for skipping my grandfather's funeral?,"My (23 NB) paternal grandfather died in 2022, a time at which I was living out of state and no-contact with my parents/low contact with extended family. I decided to put my past issues with my parents aside so that I could go to my older brother's wedding earlier this year, and so obviously my dad's family was at the wedding. I got incredibly nasty looks and weird preaching during the whole reception (deadname and all), but my brother genuinely wanted me there so whatever. My grandma (79), however, emailed me a couple of weeks ago saying that she was ""disappointed"" that I skipped grandpa's funeral a couple years ago, and that talking to everyone again pretending like nothing happened was offensive. I've heard through my sister (21) that other people on that side of the family have been saying similar stuff.

This annoyed me. In summer 2021, my parents forcibly outed me and softly disowned me, and at the time I was calling her to see if she'd talk to them or if I could drive out to her house to talk, but she said she didn't have the time. Everybody on that side lives within a 50 mile radius, so it wasn't a distance issue. I took the hint that she didn't want to deal with any of it and hitched a ride back to where I was living a couple hours away. I went no-contact with my parents, yada yada (there were a lot of other reasons too). I found out grandpa died when grandma mailed me his obituary cut out from the local newspaper with a note that said when the quasi-funeral would be (he only wanted a small graveside service).

I still considered going because my grandpa was great and my nana didn't have a funeral at all because my mom refused to have one, so it would be closure I didn't get with my nana. But technically grandpa was my step-grandpa who married my grandma decades after my biological grandpa passed away in the 80s, and his family from his first wife were all obviously going to be there. I didn't want to risk a huge stupid scene when they aren't even involved in any of it (and the risk of a scene was compounded by a blood feud my mom started with my aunt over revealing to me my dad's kid with another woman from decades ago). So I skipped.

Kind of vindictively, I emailed grandma that she has no leg to stand on because she tried to skip out on the funeral for my aunt's stillborn son in 2001. My aunt had to tell my uncle (grandma's son) to talk to my dad and get my dad to make her go. 

That pissed her off and now everyone on that side of the family is saying I'm provoking people on purpose. I don't think that's fair because almost every single ounce of bullshit originated with my parents but nobody will call it out but me, so I'm just the easy scapegoat. But I will admit that I got my aunt to spill the half-sister secret by swearing I wouldn't tell anyone, then told my siblings immediately because I was pissed at my parents. And I know certain things do provoke my dad's family, which I'm not gonna pretend I avoid (even separate from being trans, which - whole other can of worms).

4,1g4fjbb,AITA for siding with our maid over my wife? ,"Edit: We were able to find and hire two new maids, so all is good again. Thanks for all your comments; they helped me realize that it was partly my fault for allowing her to be late and not addressing it. Also, the long hours were never our intention, but it turned out that way (as I mentioned in one of the comments). Learning from that mistake, we now have separate maids for breakfast and housekeeping.

We've had a full-time maid for the past six months who helps with household chores. Her schedule is to arrive at 7 AM to make breakfast and then come back from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM, with a lunch break from 2:30 PM to 3:30 PM. We pay her well above the average salary, and the workload isn’t heavy. She has been happy working for us but recently, she has been consistently late by around 30 minutes. This has made my wife very upset.

We've talked to her multiple times, and each time she promises not to be late, but it keeps happening. 

While it doesn’t bother me much, it really infuriates my wife. Over the past month, my wife has started to find faults in everything she does and has been increasingly rude to her. She didn't fire her, but there was an incident where my wife got so angry that I had to apologize on her behalf. I also talked to my wife about it but to no avail. 

Anyway today, the maid quit (she is not the first one to do it) and I just couldn't help but tell my wife that it was due to her behavior and that she shouldn't talk to anyone like this ever again. 

Now, my wife is upset with me and accuses me of taking the side of a stranger over her. We just had a big fight about it, and it's really stressing me out. 

So, AITA? 

Edit as per Sardonyx1622 suggestion 

> I suggested that my wife find someone else because getting upset every day over this issue doesn't make sense. But she didn't. 

> As for your question: I wouldn't be too happy without the extra help, but it's manageable, so it wouldn't be a problem either.

5,1g4f23n,"AITA for Not Picking Up My Friend from Her Date, and Taking Her Home?","(Fake names, real ages and genders)

Last week, my friend Susan (25F) called me (25M) around 11:15 PM, asking if I could pick her up from a date and take her home. She lives 40 minutes south of me and, since she doesn’t have a car, had taken public transit north for the date, leaving her about 15 minutes away. By the time she called, public transit had stopped running.

I told her no. It was late, and picking her up would mean nearly two hours of driving. I didn’t think this was reasonable, especially since she had other options (her date, Uber, etc.). Her date ended up taking her home.

This morning, I woke up to a meme Susan sent me that read: 

""Just know, that if you called me at 2 AM six months from now and told me you needed me, I would break every law to get there as fast as I could. And if you called me and wanted to sit in complete silence, I would sit there until you fell asleep. I will always have your back, even if you don’t have mine.""

It felt passive-aggressive, but it made me question if I was wrong for not helping. I might have considered it if this wasn't a pattern with her…

Susan moved to the area six months ago without a job, a place to live, or a car. She asked our mutual friend, Jill (24F), if she could stay at her apartment temporarily. Jill checked with her roommates and agreed, but Susan ended up staying for weeks, which left Jill and her roommates feeling taken advantage of.

After working a summer job that provided temporary housing, Susan moved in with a family friend. I didn’t see her much during this time, but when she would transit down to hang out, I ended up driving her home—a round trip of about an hour.

There was another time Susan took public transit to hangout with friends in Jill’s old town. She knew she’d be out late and public transit would stop running, so she figured she’d just ask around for a place to crash. She ended up asking another friend, Mary (23F), if she could crash on her couch. Mary and her roommates agreed, but Susan stayed for five days. This frustrated Mary and her roommates because they thought it was only for a night..

A month after that, Susan relocated to her current apartment. She asked me to help her move, which I did—driving 30 minutes to her old place, helping load her stuff, then driving over an hour to her new place and driving the 40 minutes home.

A few weeks ago, she asked me to pick up some pillows she was going to buy on Facebook Marketplace. I was busy and declined. She seemed surprised that I’d said no, but said she’d figure something else out… she never bought the pillows.

That leads to this weekend, when she asked me to pick her up from her date. At this point, I’m starting to feel like she’s using me for my car. I want to be a reliable friend, but it feels like she’s taking advantage of my willingness to help.

Am I the asshole for saying no? Should I be more willing to help her?

6,1g4eyz0,AITA for not accepting family help with baby?,"
38F here with a baby under a year old, I’ve recently finished maternity leave. Situation is as follows: I work from home 3 days a week, husband for 2 days a week. We are lucky enough to have a nanny staying till 4pm daily, which means at that time we have to close laptops and log in later on if we need to. 

That’s the theory anyway - hasn’t been tested yet as my parents kindly came to help us while we found a suitable nanny, and she started this week. So my parents were going to go back home next weekend. 

Now on to the problem. Baby is a fussy eater and sleeper, and nanny might need a period of adjustment to handle her. Also, husband isn’t the best at feeding her, and he would need to give her dinner after 4pm. My mum, who admittedly is great with the baby, has offered to stay another couple of weeks while we see how we get on. 

Which in theory is so kind! However they have been here a month, living together, and… it’s not been the easiest. I know I sound ungrateful, but sometimes the jabs about how I don’t run my house or deal with my baby as I ‘should’ get difficult. And they really can’t stand my husband, for somewhat understandable reasons (feeling is mutual). So it’s not exactly heaven, and when she offered I was less than enthusiastic but eventually agreed - partly because it may be better for baby, and partly because I don’t want to upset mum. 

Of course now mum is upset anyway because I wasn’t enthusiastic and she feels like she begged. And she may be right - would all you sane people jump at the chance for a bit of extra help? Am I really the ungrateful unrealistic AH? 

Give it to me straight, and thanks for reading my ramble. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-15,"AITA for not accepting family help with baby?

7,1g4ewkl,AITA for refusing to turn my office into a guest room?,"We are about to have our first baby and currently have a 4 bedroom house (a classic center hall colonial). 1 Master, 2 guest rooms, and an office. Having an office has always been super important to me because I am an industrial designer and gamer; I have a large desktop and a separate 'design table' with a 3D printer, tools, cabinets, shelves and a VR set up. I'd just like to point out at this point that I've always put my wife first, I'm not that guy that ignores the wife and family to play video games. I'm only really on the computer if she's not home or if she is sleeping and this has seldom been a point of conflict in our relationship. There is no animosity between us, just a disagreement on how to use the space we have.

Now that we are having a baby she really wants to put the queen sized bed from the guest room into my office (the smallest room) which will really be cramping the space and making VR impossible. I'm obviously not a fan of this and would rather throw out the bed even though I hate the idea of wasting a whole mattress. The reason for this is to accommodate when either of our parents and families come and stay over as they often need more than 1 room. However we have 3 pull out mattresses and 4 additional couches people can sleep on if needed. Not to mention 2 inflatable queen sized mattresses if we get really desperate (it has happened once). I've offered to move my whole office to the basement but she does not like the idea of not being able to reach me right across the hall if needed. 

We are at a bit of an impasse and neither of us want to budge.  I keep arguing that the house should be made to meet our needs and not worry about hosting other people.

We are also the only one's in both our families that have the space to host everyone so every holiday is usually at our house anyways. I don't mind hosting, but I also don't want to lose 50% of my office so that someone can crash there once every few months.

Update: We settled on getting a Murphy bed. Thanks for the suggestions! ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-15,"AITA for refusing to turn my office into a guest room? We are about to have our first baby and currently have a 4 bedroom house (a classic center hall colonial). 1 Master, 2 guest rooms, and an office. Having an office has always been super important to me because I am an industrial designer and gamer; I have a large desktop and a separate 'design table' with a 3D printer, tools, cabinets, shelves and a VR set up. I'd just like to point out at this point that I've always put my wife first, I'm not that guy that ignores the wife and family to play video games. I'm only really on the computer if she's not home or if she is sleeping and this has seldom been a point of conflict in our relationship. There is no animosity between us, just a disagreement on how to use the space we have.

Now that we are having a baby she really wants to put the queen sized bed from the guest room into my office (the smallest room) which will really be cramping the space and making VR impossible. I'm obviously not a fan of this and would rather throw out the bed even though I hate the idea of wasting a whole mattress. The reason for this is to accommodate when either of our parents and families come and stay over as they often need more than 1 room. However we have 3 pull out mattresses and 4 additional couches people can sleep on if needed. Not to mention 2 inflatable queen sized mattresses if we get really desperate (it has happened once). I've offered to move my whole office to the basement but she does not like the idea of not being able to reach me right across the hall if needed. 

We are at a bit of an impasse and neither of us want to budge.  I keep arguing that the house should be made to meet our needs and not worry about hosting other people.

","Last week I went shopping with my friend. While she was trying on a shirt, I overheard some employees talking about their sales commission. When Sarah came out and didn’t like the shirt, she heard the employees talking again and got upset.

She confronted them, saying they should focus on helping customers instead of gossiping. The employees seemed surprised and tried to explain, but she kept arguing, and it got tense. Feeling awkward and uncomfortable, I decided to leave the store and wait outside.

When Sarah came out, she was mad and said I should have supported her. I felt bad but didn’t know what to do.

9,1g4er27,AITA If I drop a friend because he makes me uncomfortable,"I really need help on this. My, 15 F, friend, 15 M, has been making me really uncomfortable. Let's call him Jason. Jason doesn't understand that I don't like hugs, high-fives, or anything of the sort. I have repeatedly told him my boundaries for a little less than 3 years. He still disrespects them, so I dropped him as a friend to preserve my boundaries and mental health.

He does this with a lot of other girls in my school, too. Many of my friend are also uncomfortable around him for this or a similar reason. 

The reason I'm here is because my friend, 15 F, is calling me self-centered qnd selfish for dropping him as a friend. Sarah, not her real name, has been ignoring me ever since I dropped him. I just found out today that she thinks I'm self-centered and selfish for dropping him. I apparently hurt his feelings. I was just trying to protect myself since I have a lot of mental shit going on and Jason disrespecting my boundaries was making it worse.

To add onto why I don't like hugs and shit, I'm just uncomfortable with being touched in general. It's not something I will negotiate. Jason constantly ignored that boundary and would hug me and other stuff that involve physical touch. No matter how many times I'd tell him I don't like it, he continues. So now I'm fighting with Sarah because of this.

Where I might be the asshole is how I dropped him. I told him that if he kept touching me, I'd stop being his friend. When he did it again, I stopped talking to him all together. I know I probably could have done this in a nicer way, but because of my mental state, I wasn't thinking clearly when it happened. I'm glad I dropped him as a friend but now I'm starting to feel bad for doing it in such a harsh way.

I am not a fan of busses, so all of my kids are picked and dropped by my wife and me. My two oldest school is close to our house, and I work from home so I can easily pick and drop them.

But a few months ago, my wife got a new job offer with a much better salary and we both agreed it was best for her to take it. But the hours are later so she can no longer pick up. This was fine for our son as we just switched with the carpool so now my wife drops everyone of and they pick up my son. The issue comes from my younger daughter as now there is no one to pick her up. This means that I had to now pick up one daughter as I cannot take off that much time in the afternoon to pick both up. I decided to pick up my younger daughter for a few reasons, the bus from her school is worse as it is a public bus and her school is farther whereas my daughter has a private bus that U can pay for which is better plus her school is closer. Also, my older daughter is obviously more mature and has a phone, so I am less worried about her. My older daughter was not happy about this but agreed.

Recently though she was talking to her aunt (my SIL 50f) who she is very close with and complained that it is not fair that she has to ride the bus and none of her siblings do. My SIL and criticized us and said we are playing favorites and being unfair. I asked my daughter if she also thought we were playing favorites, and she said yes. She has complaining more and more. I asked if there's a specific reason but no she just doesn't wants to ride bus and hates it.  I agree it sucks but there's not much else I can do. So reddit AITA?

There is really one two ways to move north through central Florida. We took the Expressway. We had a full tank when we left. I decided not to even try to vet gas when heading north. Thousands of people just cane through here, there was little chance that aby gas remained. We got on I10 heading west.

I checked the maps, saw two exits coming up and based on my remaining gas, knew I'd be fine. First gas station was sketchy as hell, so I got back on the interstate and took the next exit, which I knew had a few stations as I saw it on the map.

My wife is pissed and said I took an ""unnecessary risk"" by not stopping at half a tank. But I was still heading north when I hit half and my assumption was empty stations. I had somewhere between 20 and 30 miles left on my expected range when I stopped. Gas light never came on.

My thoughts were ""everyone went north, only some people continued west, so they'll be gas this way,"" and I was right.

12,1g4edyb,AITA do I really have to help this rift?,"Hi. I'm a 23 year old with some wild family issues that I can't seem to fathom right now. 

I moved here around 8 years ago and have some pretty wild health issues so I had to stay living with my parents, two of three of my siblings, and nephew. I am the youngest of the siblings so that will come around later.

I try to help around as much as possible with cleaning, cooking, and baby sitting my siblings children, but most of the time I try to look for jobs online to do stuff as I don't have a license and most of the time doing alot of physical things is enough to knock the wind out of me.

Anyways my family had a very large rift come in between all of us and my mother snapped at everyone (she caused the rift b t w) to get a job and help pay off the mess she made with my dad. 

However this seems impossible in our situation. I help baby sit the kids constantly. And I can't drive, and before people say ""well walking and biking is good."" We live in the country, twenty minutes by car ride is the nearest town.

There are a couple of job listing that caught my eye but I know that I have no real rides to those work places. My dad goes in early, my brother has a wild schedule, and me and my sister doesn't have a car to drive, so both of us are kinda S O L.

I then look at job listening from home but my mother just came in and called me childish for playing games most of the time as I really had  little to do besides babysitting, cooking, and cleaning. When I was on break I like my hobbies of drawing and playing games. Sue me.

I tried selling art but that is a... hard business as I'm not the next picaso. Maybe in the future with time but I Don't have that. And streaming online is also hard as our internet sucks... but both those things are not ""real jobs"" in the eyes of my parents.

I've also tried to get into voice acting but some sites seem to be scams or ""take this training thing/premium to get faster"" and I don't currently have the funds for that even if I did trust it. 

And not to mention it's not my mess to clean up, I get the need for a job. But whenever I'm on the computer to look I get so much hell.

Idk what to do really. If I refuse to help then I just probably get kicked out. 

*update for some refrences*

The rift I aforementioned was a credit card debt that could of been paid off 10+years ago. My mother completely hid it from everyone and she got a unimaginable amount of money out as a loan 3 months ago to the point cars were sold. 

The scheduling is almost impossible, I've been thinking about moving in with a friend if at all possible to get closer to those jobs so biking would be a option. The reason as to why I'm 23 and jobless was, as I said medically I got alot of issues.

And when I finally got to a situation where I could maybe start a job 2020 happened and all the bad apples around that. My parents were the ones to tell me to stay inside and help with the kids when covid and all that happened.

I think the biggest annoyance is, my mom who keeps telling me to ""grow up"" is some of the money she got for the loan went to her mobile games. My shit is a hobby, that is a addiction. A couple grand of addiction within two months might i add.

I thank you for the words and hope some of this clears up some confusion.

15,1g4dr20,AITA for asking my boyfriend who I lived with to acknowledge my texts?,"I (27F) met Paul (46M) when I was living in my car due to a bad roommate situation. Our relationship started out as friends with car smoke sessions. After about a month, he offered that I could use his apartment parking spot overnights since he didn’t have a car. A few weeks later, we kissed, and few days after that he invited me inside his apartment.  I finally agreed since I was not wanting to meet his adult son (25m) at first since we only had a 2 year age difference. Initially, I only stayed occasionally, but after a few nights in a row, he invited me to live with him for a month while I sorted out new housing. Things were great, and I felt cared for in a way I hadn’t before. He reassured me that he accepted me and didn’t want to fix me, even when I shared that I have bipolar disorder and would have emotional highs and lows.

After 3 weeks I asked if he wanted me to stay longterm cause things were going great and he said ""of course"" as if it was funny I even had to ask. After I settled in, things started to change. He became distant during the third month, spending more time ""accidentally"" sleeping on the couch and I felt like he avoided time alone with me except for sex. 

I also noticed concerning behavior—he would often snap at his cat and his son over small things, and I began to fear that his anger might eventually be directed at me. When I expressed this fear, he assured me that he would never treat me that way and that his son and him have a harsh communication style. 

He also told me to stop asking if everything was okay between us, promising that he would tell me if there were issues. When it came up that he had ended a 7 yr relationship by ""becoming an asshole"" and making her break it off it terrified me but he gave his word that would never happen. 

At some point I received a backpay from disability tax credits and had a few weeks where I was trying to make it last and used wisely. He used my debit card info when getting himself DoorDash without asking many times the week after I had added it on his account for a specific meal we shared. I was locked out of my banking account at that time and I think he thought I wouldn't notice. He often would ""forget"" to refill his bus card and would call and ask if I could, which made me feel taken advantage of financially since no repayments were offered. 

He seemed to withhold food from me since last week after I barely ate dinner on a day I was nauseous from anxiety and wrapped it for the fridge. His son cooks as contribution instead of rent money and the rent I had paid each month was understood to include food. The next 3 days I wasn't invited when his son made food which honestly was rough because the fridge and pantry were basically bare and mostly designed not for cooking individual servings. When I heard the oven one night I went and saw they made chicken stips but had eaten without asking if I need food. When I went to eat some strips, I was harshly reminded I still had leftovers from days prior. This felt manipulative and petty since he could have easily voiced concerns of food waste instead of denying me eating with the household. 

Last week, I sent him a long text about my concerns, explaining that I needed communication and was feeling increasingly unwelcome.  I won't share the entire text for brevity but my main points were.

He texted that he was too tired to read it that early but promised that he would.  He didn’t respond for days. I followed up after 4 days, and he say he still hadn’t read the message. I was starting to look for places to live and hoped the relationship would improve by not living together since it was such a fresh relationship. 

I went to a family dinner, and stayed overnight at my mom’s after drinking , so I texted him to let him know I wouldn’t be home until the next day. He didn’t respond to that message either, and I felt disrespected by his constant lack of acknowledgment.

The next day I texted this; 

""Paul, I'm truthfully getting extremely frustrated that you refuse to acknowledge my texts or reply to them. I am not under the impression that I am very welcome in your life and am taking it pretty personally. I don't know what you expect me to do about that or if you have any desire to change it even because you don't let me know. I love you. 

Please respond that you have at least read this or I'm going to become further estranged from you and I don't want that. ""

He exploded; 

""You know what…. How many fucking times do I have to fucking tell you, when im at fucking work, I do not answer my fucking phone… you know what, fuck this, fuck you, we are fucking done!! I’ll bring you fucking shit down to you when I fucking get home tonight!! Don’t fucking talk to me again.
We are fucking done. ""

I was shocked by his harsh reaction despite it being slowly more evident that he was upset and refusing to talk. He blocked me and told me he wanted me gone. This was completely unexpected, as he had always reassured me that he was happy with me living there. I had even asked him every couple of weeks if he wanted me to stay, and he always said yes. His sudden shift felt like he was trying to find a reason to end it. 

I feel deeply hurt and used. I just wanted simple communication from him and am now in a desperate situation where I'm back homeless in my car but the weather here in Canada is getting cold so it's not a longterm solution. I am frustrated because I had that tax money that I was planning on using for a deposit and would have afforded moving fees but it's now gone because at the time I had clarified with paul that I could stay and things were comfortable and peaceful. 

Was I wrong for asking for basic acknowledgment and communication? Was my message too harsh?
",TL;DR,2024-10-15,"AITA for asking my boyfriend who I lived with to acknowledge my texts? I (27F) met Paul (46M) when I was living in my car due to a bad roommate situation. Our relationship started out as friends with car smoke sessions. After about a month, he offered that I could use his apartment parking spot overnights since he didn’t have a car. A few weeks later, we kissed, and few days after that he invited me inside his apartment.  I finally agreed since I was not wanting to meet his adult son (25m) at first since we only had a 2 year age difference. Initially, I only stayed occasionally, but after a few nights in a row, he invited me to live with him for a month while I sorted out new housing. Things were great, and I felt cared for in a way I hadn’t before. He reassured me that he accepted me and didn’t want to fix me, even when I shared that I have bipolar disorder and would have emotional highs and lows.

After 3 weeks I asked if he wanted me to stay longterm cause things were going great and he said ""of course"" as if it was funny I even had to ask. After I settled in, things started to change. He became distant during the third month, spending more time ""accidentally"" sleeping on the couch and I felt like he avoided time alone with me except for sex. 

I also noticed concerning behavior—he would often snap at his cat and his son over small things, and I began to fear that his anger might eventually be directed at me. When I expressed this fear, he assured me that he would never treat me that way and that his son and him have a harsh communication style. 

He also told me to stop asking if everything was okay between us, promising that he would tell me if there were issues. When it came up that he had ended a 7 yr relationship by ""becoming an asshole"" and making her break it off it terrified me but he gave his word that would never happen. 

At some point I received a backpay from disability tax credits and had a few weeks where I was trying to make it last and used wisely. He used my debit card info when getting himself DoorDash without asking many times the week after I had added it on his account for a specific meal we shared. I was locked out of my banking account at that time and I think he thought I wouldn't notice. He often would ""forget"" to refill his bus card and would call and ask if I could, which made me feel taken advantage of financially since no repayments were offered. 

He seemed to withhold food from me since last week after I barely ate dinner on a day I was nauseous from anxiety and wrapped it for the fridge. His son cooks as contribution instead of rent money and the rent I had paid each month was understood to include food. The next 3 days I wasn't invited when his son made food which honestly was rough because the fridge and pantry were basically bare and mostly designed not for cooking individual servings. When I heard the oven one night I went and saw they made chicken stips but had eaten without asking if I need food. When I went to eat some strips, I was harshly reminded I still had leftovers from days prior. This felt manipulative and petty since he could have easily voiced concerns of food waste instead of denying me eating with the household. 

Last week, I sent him a long text about my concerns, explaining that I needed communication and was feeling increasingly unwelcome.  I won't share the entire text for brevity but my main points were. 

"" I miss the closeness we used to have and I’m struggling with how to be around you when it feels like you’re indifferent to me—when I asked about your day I barely even got eye contact and a brief response....
...Being shunned by people I love is already a sore spot, and this silent treatment is one of the most painful things you could subject me to. You gave me your word that you wouldn’t act like an ass hole to make me break up with you...

My colleague (29F) is a graphic designer as well. She arrived 3 or 4 months prior to my arrival almost two years ago.
Last week, she delivered logos/icons for a famous Canadian gamer who required a new branding, logo included.

The logos are really nice, we sent the two final options we made to the client. She is quite happy with the results but ask for some changes, totally normal at this stage of the process. 
I kind of « take back » the project from my colleague and start finding inspiration for the requested changes. And then, it’s when it happened: I found both logos on Pinterest. Exactly the same, not even an angle difference. 
(I did compare them one above the other).

I find the first one and send it on our project slack channel. My boss is like « indeed it looks the same, we have to find another way ».It’s not « looking the same » it’s the same, but my boss isn’t really there that day she’s getting tattooed.
Continuing my researches I find the second logo. I didn’t want to push too hard on my colleague and instead of sending it again on the slack channel with everyone, sent it to my boss directly. For me, it’s her role to discuss with her about this issue.
However, my boss is just like « oh damn looking the same as well, we need to be more careful on the logos we send and check if there are similar one online » and proceeded to say exactly that on the client project channel.

I’m fuming, for me it’s THE thing you can’t do as a designer, and it’s a serious reason for a breach of contract. 

Just imagine if the client was fully happy with the option and we just went with it?? 

During a meeting today, my colleague said she never saw these logos or that *maybe* she just saw them and unconsciously draw them then recreated them… which is impossible as even the rotation is exactly the same. Like it’s physically impossible.

2 months ago, GMIL took a fall. She could not get up herself and needed some medical help. My husband and I made the hard decision that she could no longer watch our son by herself. She stated she understood the decision, but didn't want to talk further on it yet.

Once we got home from vacation, my husband tried to reach out to her. He texted her asking how she was, and then again a couple of days later a picture of our new cats we adopted to try to break the ice. She responded back with curt replies. We went to visit my MIL and GMIL a couple of weeks ago. Within an hour, GMIL looked at us and said ""we need to talk, us three"", and I knew that something was obviously wrong and we had been blindsided.  It turned out that she was incredibly angry with us for not reaching out and essentially making her feel better about the situation. She used a lot more words, said it in many different ways, insulted us by saying we lacked compassion, but it all came down to we didn't reach out to her.

19,1g4d59h,WIBTA If I Take The Cat,"I moved a few months ago, and as I like to go for nocturnal walks I've met a lot of the stray cats in the area.   
One cat in particular I have really bonded with and befriended. She's light orange with blue eyes and I've been calling her Daisy. When I first met her she was so infested with fleas that you would pet her and get a live flea on your hand- it was disgusting. It was also clearly distressing to her, as she was always grooming herself- to the point of hair loss in some places- and flicking her tail in frustration. She was also quite literally skin and bones, I could see every one of her ribs. In spite of this she's a very friendly cat, always meowing at me and rubbing on my leg, and loves to be pet.  
I felt very bad for Daisy so I started visiting her nightly. She was always in more or less the same place, in front of a house about a block away. I never saw any people but this isn't out of the ordinary as it is nighttime when I visit her usually- typically around 1am. I would bring food to her every day, and I was able to get some flea medicine that was about to expire from the vet I work for and put it on her. She's looking so much better, starting to grow hair back in the places she had groomed raw, has some actual meat on her bones, and seems much happier. I've gotten very attached to her as well. A few days ago I borrowed a microchip reader to make sure she wasn't someone's lost pet- friendly as she is- and it showed that she has no chip.  
Today I bought her a new bowl because my dishwasher melted my old one, and I was really excited about it so I went to ""show it to her"" by giving her a little snack. This is the first time I've gone to see her in the day. A man was in front of the house doing work on the car in the driveway, and at first he ignored me but after Daisy crawled out of hiding and started eating he scowled at me and told me to please not feed his cat and to go away.  
Now I'm conflicted. I've really bonded with this cat and am tempted to catch her and take her to the vet, have her chipped in my name, and keep her. The owner clearly isn't doing a good job caring for her given the state she was in when I first met her, and technically she's legally a stray as a permanently outdoor cat with no chip. On the other hand I believe the man that she's his cat, as she is always at that same house and is too friendly to be strictly wild.  
What would the moral thing to do be in this case? I know stealing is wrong but I'm also worried about Daisy.

At the end of the night it came time to pay the bill and everyone just started to pack up and leave. I thought they forgot about the bill so I called  them all back but my girlfriend said that I should let them go. So I stupidly thought she had saved up to pay the bill. But no she expected me to pay it. She said that I easily make more than anyone there and I should just cover it as a birthday gift. She said this like it was a small bill. The bill (translating to USD) was $550. Obviously a lot of money. This is so much money  Most of the cost was alcohol which I had one glass of wine because I still had to drive.  So I said no, paid for my share and my girlfriend and the tip and left. 
 
That really soured my mood. When we got back to my place my girlfriend was a bit tipsy and wanted to stay up but I just said I was tired and went to bed. I avoided her on Sunday and I woke up early before her to go to the office today and have just been ignoring her messages. Some of our friends are saying I shouldn't be mad because it's not even that much for me because I make (translated to USD) a six figure salary. I still don't think it was fair to spring that on me though. The thing is, I wouldn't have had a problem had she just asked. But the fact that she made it a surprise just irked me. I'm thinking that perhaps I'm too caught up on the principle of the issue rather than the actions themselves.

I thought they forgot about the bill so I called  them all back but my girlfriend said that I should let them go. So I stupidly thought she had saved up to pay the bill. But no she expected me to pay it. She said that I easily make more than anyone there and I should just cover it as a birthday gift. She said this like it was a small bill. The bill (translating to USD) was $550. Obviously a lot of money. This is so much money  Most of the cost was alcohol which I had one glass of wine because I still had to drive.  So I said no, paid for my share and my girlfriend and the tip and left. 
 
That really soured my mood. When we got back to my place my girlfriend was a bit tipsy and wanted to stay up but I just said I was tired and went to bed. I avoided her on Sunday and I woke up early before her to go to the office today and have just been ignoring her messages. Some of our friends are saying I shouldn't be mad because it's not even that much for me because I make (translated to USD) a six figure salary. I still don't think it was fair to spring that on me though. The thing is, I wouldn't have had a problem had she just asked. But the fact that she made it a surprise just irked me. I'm thinking that perhaps I'm too caught up on the principle of the issue rather than the actions themselves.

Edut: I didn't let the other guests leave before paying. ",0.0,0.0907759740948677,0,1
21,1g4cmkw,AITA for paying for my kids class trip when their stepsister and stepcousin can't go?,"My ex and I (both 30) separated after the birth of our twins 8 years ago. We had only dated for 14 months when she got pregnant and we only stayed together during the pregnancy because we wanted to try and be a family for our kids sake. But she met someone else and fell for him and wanted to ""have a chance at love"". Our separation was amicable enough. We co-parented well for the first two years. But when she met her husband (not the guy she fell in love with during our relationship) things changed. He was a single father and sole provider for his daughter who was the same age as our kids and she declared I would be responsible for including her like she was my child too if I was buying gifts or doing anything fun with our kids. This started us on a bad path and now we parallel parent instead of co-parent because I was expected to babysit her stepkid (and nephew and now younger daughter) when I wanted to have fun with my kids and I was supposed to spend equally across all kids for gifts.

Ex and I have 50/50 custody. Nobody pays child support because we both have our kids an equal amount of time. My kids and I are close. I do not include the other children at their mom's house when I have them and I do not interact with those other children. Three years ago their stepdad's nephew moved in with them and a year later their mom and stepdad had a baby daughter together so they have a stepsister, stepcousin and a half sister at that house and my ex is expecting again (potentially).

This is partially where the fight comes from. The school the kids go to is small so they're in the same class as the steps. And they have a class trip coming up in November to an interactive museum. It's expensive for a class trip at their age but I can afford it and the kids want to go so I paid. But my ex was pissed. She and her husband can't afford to send the stepdaughter and nephew and my ex told me I should either pay for all four to go or all four could miss it. I said no. I told her I have the right to pay for them to go and the trip falls during my parenting time so I can send them. Her husband told me I was sabotaging their family and being a dick to kids who get to see their family go on the class trip they can't be a part of. He told me I should care more about all the kids. My ex backed him (of course) and said the kids hating each other will be all on me.

24,1g4c6o3,AITA for telling my best friend I won’t help her plan her wedding ,"My (29F) best friend (29F) and I have been best friends since birth. We are cousins and her kids (9&10) are my godkids. We had a very hard childhood (both extremely poor and hers was even more abusive, almost cult-like). We grew even closer once becoming adults and learning how the actual world operates. Which is why it makes me sick to think I’d ever tell her not to talk to me about her wedding. 

Backstory: almost two years ago she met a guy and secretly shotgun married him a few weeks after. Since then, she has learned he cannot hold down a job due to excessive calling out. He is financially irresponsible, and puts her in tight situations often. He is very slobby, like a toddler tornado. She has to ask him to even brush his teeth. She has told me (and him) that she doesn’t feel he loves her kids. He is blatantly racist. She begs him to show her affection quite often. He tells her what she’s allowed to wear and who she’s allowed to hang out with. He refuses to eat most fruits and vegetables, which makes him very sickly, and he refuses to take the medicine to help fix it. 

She thought about annulling the marriage within a month, but legally couldn’t. She’s threatened to leave him several times, and quite often calls me crying. At one point, I had to tell her that unless she was planning on actually leaving him, to please stop telling me the mean things he does because it was stressing me out badly. He’s not allowed at my house anymore after a visit where he started lying about me to make me apologize for random things I didn’t do, just as a manipulation tactic. I now decline most plans where he is involved, unless it’s a godkid’s birthday party. I even celebrated her birthday separately last year, since he would be at her party. 

Well, because she never got a wedding ceremony, she wants to plan one now, and for me to be the Maid of Honor. I don’t even want to see his face, or be any part of this, but told her I love her and will support her on her day even though I’m firmly against this relationship.

Through PT and exercise I've regained 80% mobility in my arm but have a 30lb weight restriction due to muscle damage and damage to the shoulder of that arm. My disability doesn't affect my ability to walk long distances. Instead it has to do with carrying or pushing heavy things.

I was doing ok for awhile after finishing PT but now my baby is a toddler and has reached my weight restriction. I've been having problems with pain and mobility in the arm when getting her in and out of car seats, and especially trying to manage her and a grocery cart. I can't push a cart over a speed bump easily and shopping trips end up with me in pain for the rest of the day. I do try to only go to the store with my husband or leave my daughter with him but its not always doable.

26,1g4bv1e,AITA for overreacting when my friend accused me of hitting on her bf,"So what happened is that today I was talking to my friend and she suddenly says that she is angry at me for something I did. I asked her about it and she told me that about 1 month ago on my “best friends”( lets call her Anna) birthday party most of our class was  invited but my another friend( lets call her Sarah) was not able to join us but Sarah’s boyfriend was also in the party as he was in our friend circle. The thing is that I never liked Sarah’s boyfriend so I barely ever talk to him but in that party the only people I knew were Anna, Anna’s boyfriend and Sarah’s boyfriend so Anna suggested that I should sit with both of them, but I refused because I don’t like Sarah’s boyfriend but we were trying to remain on cordial terms for Sarah. 

So the main story is that, that day I was wearing an off shoulder top and while we were dancing, socialising and eating  my top was going up and I was adjusting it and trying to keep it off shoulders cause it would look weird on shoulders because then my bra outline would be visible. 

Almost 10-20 min before the entire party was over he came and sat next to me and I still didn’t talk to him also because Sarah is a little insecure. The next day Anna and Sarah’s bf told Sarah that I was pulling my top down when Sarah’s boyfriend was near me. They said that I was trying to hit on him and that he got uncomfortable because of me. After 1 month of this thing she comes and tells me about this and she says it in a way that I should be apologetic at assure her that I am not hitting on her bf. But instead I start crying cause it felt as if she was character assassinating me and trying to make a point that I am wrong. I explained the situation to her and she said it’s fine I trust you but the thing is that when I was crying she started saying that I am overreacting and it’s not that big of a deal. 

Am I overreacting? Am I the asshole?

Edit: SIDE STORY 
So about 3-4 months ago my bf and Sarah grew closer and they were friends and I had no issue with it cause my bf is introvert and he barely talks to anyone. 

But my entire friend circle which consists of about 20 people told me to be alert about their friendship cuz he would spend more time with her than me. 

I never really thought of something like this cuz I am very secure as a person but 12 days ago my bf broke up with me and according to him and a few common friends Sarah advised him to break up with me.

27,1g4a4e3,AITA for making plans for thanksgiving and Christmas that don't involve my family even though I'm only 17?,"My boyfriend's parents invited me to join them for Thanksgiving and Christmas this year. We (both 17) started dating 2 years ago and I love his family and I think they're so nice and supportive and welcoming. But I never spent any holidays with them before. It was always with my family. But my boyfriend and his family know I hate family celebrations with my family. They also know I have complicated stuff going on. So I told them I'd be there and I would love to spend the day with them.

Because I know background might be asked. My family is a blended family. I was 4 months old when my mom met my stepdad. I was 3 when they got married. My stepdad has kids from his first marriage (his first wife died). My stepsiblings are 22 and 24. For years I said dad/siblings but I don't anymore. I was never accepted by my stepsiblings. My mom was never accepted by them either. My stepdad ""loved me like his own"" and ""thought of me as his own"" but he didn't treat me the same and it was really clear because he would always excuse his kids treating me badly and saying mean things but one time my aunt told my parents that they should be corrected for being ""nasty little bullies"" and my stepdad lost his mind at my aunt. He never did that when I was treated that way. My aunt was my only extended family. When she died I only had my stepdad's side. I never knew my dad or his family. So that was it. My stepdad's extended family are okay. But their loyalty is with his real kids. My stepsiblings could call me names at the dinner table and tell me to get the fuck out and they'd be okay with it because they're the real family, not me.

My mom never did much to protect me either. She's okay with them treating us like we're strangers who made their mom die. Sometimes she'd reassure me that I was loved or she'd tell me it would get better. But the oldest has two kids now and a husband/boyfriend and I'm not allowed to hold or interact with the kids. Neither is mom. Last year I felt invisible and ended up crying out in the car because I was left out of the family photo with everyone.

So I'm ready to be with my boyfriend's family this year. Only my mom and stepdad found out and they said I can't go and I'm only 17. I put my foot down and said I won't listen to them. They said Thanksgiving and Christmas are for family and I should reflect on who I am when I'd skip being with family for a boyfriend. They mentioned me being 17 more than once and said I don't get to make these decisions.

He never did that when I was treated that way. My aunt was my only extended family. When she died I only had my stepdad's side. I never knew my dad or his family. So that was it. My stepdad's extended family are okay. But their loyalty is with his real kids. My stepsiblings could call me names at the dinner table and tell me to get the fuck out and they'd be okay with it because they're the real family, not me.

My mom never did much to protect me either. She's okay with them treating us like we're strangers who made their mom die. Sometimes she'd reassure me that I was loved or she'd tell me it would get better. But the oldest has two kids now and a husband/boyfriend and I'm not allowed to hold or interact with the kids. Neither is mom. Last year I felt invisible and ended up crying out in the car because I was left out of the family photo with everyone.

So I'm ready to be with my boyfriend's family this year. Only my mom and stepdad found out and they said I can't go and I'm only 17. I put my foot down and said I won't listen to them. They said Thanksgiving and Christmas are for family and I should reflect on who I am when I'd skip being with family for a boyfriend. They mentioned me being 17 more than once and said I don't get to make these decisions.

28,1g49zsg,AITA for just being accepted by my bfs family resulting my bfs bestfriend's gf to talk shit behind our back and in the end resulting in their break up?,"So i (18)f 17 at the time  have been in a relationship with my bf 18 m . I was just overthinking this so got to ask some advice. I live in India .For some background my bf is a obedient person and would do anything for his friends . The bestfriend 18f  let's call him mike is my  neighbour but we are on low contact as we are being busy in our  own lifes as eventually we Stopped talking .

 My bf was his childhood bestfriend idk from 6th grade . We met through this bestfriend of his, we immediately clicked and so we started dating without our family knowing ofcourse. For some contact Mike to has a gf let's call her Jennie. They met before us but would fight alot ok I'm a good listener who would be the peace maker and would listen to their backb*tiching each other it was all on chat .

 I'm beautiful like not like Bollywood actress but more than a average looking girl it's my family's and even strangers sayings. I'm really a friendly girl i talk to everyone so as accordingly Mike and i started talking as logically he introduced my bf to me But Within the first half of the month mike asked me to have s*x with him but i declined as a result him begging me to keep this a secret and to delete this chat and so to not ruin my bfs and his friendship i obliged but just incase i kept that ""specific chat"" . After 2 months in we were ""eventually ""caught by my bfs aucle but we weren't forced to break up in turn i was introduced to his family and he was introduced to mine. And happy as I was but on the same day of meeting my bf's family my bf told me to block the couple.  

It took a lot of asking and talking for my bf to finally send me a screenshot of Jennie and a mutual friend talking about how she was jealous of me and i don't work ""hard ""enough to deserve this and how she'll ""leave Mike to this stupid couple"" meaning us this really hurt me as I was really a good friend to both of them. 

During me being a peace maker i did something which was genuinely not my fault  but would need advice.  Mike took my bfs Instagram account and messaged me saying "" baby Mike and Jennie are fighting please help them"" i would not  like my bfs  bestfriend to call me baby so i told Jennie but nothing happened . In this arguing Mike blackmailed me that he'll come to my house and tell my mom . Yes i know why are you scared? Bcoz this was before us being caught and my bfs chill uncle sorted things out . And i was really scared as i used to stay alone at the evenings . 

You might think why would you block Mike it was Jennie talking those things well Mike would side with her and i actually didn't block them on one social platform and i admit i talked to him rudely .
But the ""talk"" really opened my eyes about how mike turned out to be. Yes Jennie is toxic and Mike was also turning toxic and so as a result i blocked both of them where as my bf just blocked Jennie.

29,1g49vvx,AITA for talking with a woman at the bar more then her partner ,"I M28 went out with a couple of my guy friends on Saturday night. We all wanted a calm night, enjoy some drinks and watch some football. I was sitting on the end of our group at the bar with 2 open seats next to me. It was a little crowded but not enough to be running into each other. I feel somebody bump into me. It was a couple, she apologized and asked if the seats next to me were taken. I said oh no go ahead. I must note, she had on some type of sparkly heel shoe with lulu lemons leggings and a lower cut shirt and her makeup was all done. The guy she was with had on sweet pants a baggy sweatshirt. The way they were dressed and energy levels both didn’t match. After sitting next to me for 5-10 minutes I made a comment about a call to my friend and she asked me how I saw that in live time. Just trying to be friendly I started speaking with her. I must add i recently was broken up with and also am helping take care of a sick family member. My brain isn’t thinking about picking anybody up. Anyway she starts chatting with me about the game. Being kind of flirty and is now facing more towards me then the guy she came in with. I mentioned her partner and she did confirm that yes they were together. This went on for the remainder of the game. Her asking me a bunch of questions. Where I grew up where I went to school. My age. If I was seeing anybody. All while leaning in towards me. I tried a couple more times to add him to the conversation since he was looking annoyed. She cut him off quickly and started going back to asking questions. It was at about this time they whispered some stuff to each other. Then he seemed to not be as annoyed. A couple of minutes later after us talking. I noticed they both started to get a lot more touchy with each other. This went on for maybe another 10-15 minutes before the game was over. After it was left she said goodbye and hugged me. Which I’m not sure if I was off put by the entire experience but it seemed like it was out of left field. It was for sure a tight hug. Then they both left. Shortly after we paid our tabs and even the bartender joked with me it was odd. She also mentioned they gave off swinger vibes. Which I kind of felt but I didn’t want to say anything.

30,1g49kyc,AITA for trying to make my partner and my best friend like each other?,"I've (26F) been seeing D (35M) for about 8 months. We never declared our relationship official, but weve been monogamous for a bit.

This past weekend I had my best friend (28M,S) visit the city and stay with me. weve been friends for 8+ years. Never had any kind of flirty or romantic connection.

S fell on hard times. I offered to let him stay on my couch. I suspected this may make my partner uncomfortable so I thought it would be a good idea to have S come to D's house to spend time together. Heres how it went:

1: D had surprise company. I had to get ready. I told D that S and I would go upstairs to use the mirror and hang out. When S showed up, D was in the bathroom. We went upstairs, I got ready. When we came down, D was gone.  
\* I told D where we'd be. He was in the bathroom. We came down, he was gone. The time for introductions passed. It felt like D was avoiding us.  
D: a man he barely knows showed up to his house+snuck upstairs while he was gone. S did not introduce himself or shake Ds hand. He felt disrespected. He went to do laundry, came home, still no introduction

2: We leave S's car at D's house. We invite D out with us, declined. I said I'd leave my backpack and overnight gear. I'd contact him when the show was over, bring S to get his car, I'd stay at D's house that night. D and I spoke on SC+he stopped opening messages around 1:30-1:50 am. Show ended at 2. I drove S's friends to their hotel. After ushering 8 drunk strangers I text D at 2:50: I was DD, its a big group, Id socialize with them for a bit, it will be a late night. if youre asleep, we'll link up in the morning  
\*I knew D fell asleep because he stopped responding to the first two messages. I kept him updated in case he happened to wake up. I tried two methods of communication. I let him sleep.  
D: I stayed out late with someone he already felt disrespected by. He was expecting me to come home. He didnt hear from me+had no idea what I was doing.

3: Next morning we dont hear from D. Wait until about 1pm to call him. D is distant and cold. I ask to come get our stuff and see him. He put my bag in the doorway. Hes stoic. I try to have a conversation. Declined

4: I confront D. He felt disrespected+left in the dark. S didnt introduce himself as a man, he isnt sure that S didn't have ulterior motives with me, I was out late with no contact, had a man sneak around his house with me and then stay the night at my place. This was something he didnt trust. He shut down.  
From my perspective, I brought S to his house with the expressed purpose of showing him that S is not a threat. That if they spent time together in D's space, he would get to know S as much as possible and feel comfortable with me opening my doors to him. I had fully intended on coming home to D but he fell asleep

I am currently in a massive legal battle over breach of (my) contract and wrongful termination. 

As imagined, I’ve been stressed and burned out beyond belief, to where everyday it’s something new. The only relaxing I get is when I sleep and eat my breakfast in the morning. Yesterday I left my court mandated therapy and got a text from a friend about wanting to hang out. I was meeting up with my lawyer in the next hour, so I told her no, saying I was busy. 

I was still in the process of unpacking from moving back from Asia as well. My employer took a contract with a company in a certain country in Asia, so I was at that location for about 4 months until they were satisfied. On my way back to the United States is when I learned I was being terminated.

After a very long session with legal, I was freed, around 6:00pm. I started cooking a power bowl so I could just eat dinner, and cry myself to sleep. My friend called me, and asked if we could hang out.

She knows I’m in the middle of the most stressful period of life I’ve experienced for a long time. I got mad at her on the phone, and told her I’m to busy, and I don’t want to.

I want to apologize for the length of this post and any grammar mistakes—English isn't my native language. This post is about me (M18), my father (M47), my uncle (M45), and my grandparents (M73, F75).

My father's relationship with his family has been difficult, starting from his childhood. He and his brother grew up with harsh, Soviet-style parenting, and as the older child, my dad bore the brunt of it. Although things improved somewhat as they got older, my grandparents remained manipulative and controlling. This caused distance between my dad and his family.

For example, my grandfather owns a company and is financially stable, but my uncle, who never focused on academics, was given everything when my grandfather retired. Meanwhile, my dad, who worked hard to earn two degrees in Computer Science and Business Administration, was denied financial help when he wanted to start his own company. This widened the rift between my dad and his brother.

Despite all this, my dad has been a great father to us, though he has struggled with depression and anxiety, partly due to his job but also because of the strained family relationships.

A few years ago, my uncle wanted to relocate to Canada. My dad supported him, but my grandfather manipulated him into staying, using guilt and control. My dad was disappointed, seeing my uncle’s decision as one motivated by fear of losing financial support. After that, my dad has decided that we all need to  cut off contact with his family.

Last week they had to do some grosserie-shopping, so they asked around and I had nothing to do at that point, so I said, that Ill drive them. Before I headed to my grandmas house (where they live during their stay) I asked my dad, if I could have his car.

I have my own car, a 2000 Honda Accord, it is a bit hard to get in and out of, thats why I asked my dad for his very new Hyundai Kona, as it is easier to get in and out of, he only had it for not even a month at that point.

He said ""no, they will fit in your Accord"". When I took my Accord to pick them up, my great-grandpa couldnt get in, my great-grandma didnt even try. Thats why I called my dad saying ""sorry, but they wont fit in my car, could we please have yours?"", he sighed ""okay fine"" and I took his car.

Last week they had to do some grosserie-shopping, so they asked around and I had nothing to do at that point, so I said, that Ill drive them. Before I headed to my grandmas house (where they live during their stay) I asked my dad, if I could have his car.

I have my own car, a 2000 Honda Accord, it is a bit hard to get in and out of, thats why I asked my dad for his very new Hyundai Kona, as it is easier to get in and out of, he only had it for not even a month at that point.

He said ""no, they will fit in your Accord"". When I took my Accord to pick them up, my great-grandpa couldnt get in, my great-grandma didnt even try. Thats why I called my dad saying ""sorry, but they wont fit in my car, could we please have yours?"", he sighed ""okay fine"" and I took his car.

35,1g491ke,AITA for storming out of my in-laws at a family dinner?,"My husband (40M) and I (35F) went to my in-laws for a large family gathering and all was well. In 12 years of marriage, I have always been polite to his family, though we find these gatherings stressful. Both of us are the “quiet ones” in our families and often we feel forced to concede to louder personalities, which is a point of contention.

After 4 hours, we decided it was time to go. Dessert had not been served yet, but we were willing to skip it in favour of getting some down time before bed.

We went into the kitchen to let my SIL (42F), the host, know we would be leaving. She then physically cornered my husband and pointed her finger at him and said ""no way, you're staying for dessert"". To which he replied, no it's okay, we don't want any. This went back and forth, escalating to my SIL actually pushing my husband in a sort of rough housing way. She seemed to think it was a joke because she was laughing the whole time. My husband was laughing too, but I recognized it as an uncomfortable laughter someone does when they don’t know how to react. In the end, I stepped in and tried to say ""no, but really, we're going to get going"" and my SIL then turned to me and (jokingly) said ""if you don't eat this dessert, I'm going to throw it at your car when you leave"".

For whatever reason, that triggered some instantaneous rage I have never felt before. I literally got blurred vision. I ended up grabbing the dessert from her hand, slammed it on the counter, and stormed out of the house while yelling at my husband to follow me. On the drive home, my husband admitted he felt he was being pushed to make a decision he didn't want to. He also understood my anger, but said that it was a little scary to witness and that pretty much everyone in the house noticed my reaction.

That night, my SIL texted that my behaviour was rude and I was being ungrateful for her hard work hosting, and offer of food/dessert. I apologized for how I reacted as I was not proud of it after the fact and explained it was not about the dessert itself, but the greater issue of having my boundaries pushed. I added that I got extremely defensive of my husband because I didn't like seeing him shutting down like that in a conflict. This last part was what my SIL seemed to fixate on. She told me I shouldn't be my husband's babysitter and he can fight his own battles. She then proceeded to enter a texting war with both me and my husband. She told me I have mental problems if I'm going to freak out that much about a dessert I don't want to eat (again, not about the dessert) and that I have no respect for the family and act like I never want to be there. To my husband, she basically called him a child for not being able to tell her how he feels in the moment (but this anger is a typical reaction for her, so why would he?).

It all escalated to the point where my SIL now wants zero contact with us and has blocked us on everything, and told the rest of the family that she doesn't want us in her life.

I spent two whole days doing data collection for one of her PhD studies and I never got anything in return, but I didn’t mind bc I considered her a friend, that’s what friends do.

Anyway, she got married last year and on the invitation they clearly said they don’t expect gifts. I didn’t get a gift because of the above and I also just couldn’t afford one. I went to all of her bridal appointments, which was quite a hassle to get to (2hr drive there and back), but I wanted to be there for her. So I guess I felt like I had been a good friend to her in that I made the effort to celebrate her for all her fittings. The wedding came and went, we had a great time. 

Fast forward a few months and we’re staying together at a hotel for a conference. I’m presenting as I was a finalist for an award for one of my previous papers. That night was the party night and she decided to stay at the hotel as she was stressed with her PhD which wasn’t going to well. I went & ended up having a great evening with the vice-president of the society that hosts the conference (one of the top experts in our field). He had asked me to come into an amazing project with him & I was so excited.
I woke up the next morning and told her about the night. All of a sudden she became really upset bc the bathroom was a mess (I have no memory of being in the bathroom, apparently I’d touched her makeup and made a mess but I only remember coming home and going to bed?). She was yelling at me about how disrespectful I was, I apologised a lot.

Out of nowhere she says “I noticed you never got me a wedding gift by the way”. It really shocked me as I thought I’d been a really good friend and they didn’t ask for gifts. She knew my financial situation was bad. She then says “guess how much it costs to have a wedding” I refused to answer and said I know it’s expensive, she asked 3 more times (super aggressively). I just said how sorry I was, I didn’t realise that was the expectation, it’s the first wedding I’ve been to for a friend and I took the instruction on the invitation literally.

She then started asking if we were even friends and if I didn’t know what what customary I should have just “looked it up”. She also asked “if you’re so poor how did you afford to get here?” (Scholarships).

I think she was jealous of the opportunities i had had and been offered, as I am younger and had only just started my PhD.

On the holiday I said I go to badminton on Sundays and they’d be welcome to come when there was space (I usually go with two other friends). A expressed that she really likes badminton and would like to come. J said he’d like to come. He also expressed that he doesn’t have much of a male friend group and would appreciate being included because he misses it. Separately, A said she worries about him and knows he would benefit from being in the group.



Some context: They have previously dated on and off and have known each other since school (we’re all 26 years old). J does whatever A asks and can be a push-over, even if he is a lovely guy. His self-esteem is a bit low, I think. An example being that she would constantly call him “submissive and breedable”. He asked her to stop many times, but she didn’t and he just accepted it. She will also often play-hit me and him, but more so him, to a degree that I have expressed being uncomfortable with. This ranges from mini-slaps to kicks in the balls.



Anyway, we all go back home and it’s Saturday night. I book badminton for the regular group of 3. There is one more spot, so I decide to invite J, over text. 5 minutes later I get a text from A, in all caps, “You two faced bitch”. I explained that I invited him because there was one spot and that, after our talk about desiring a healthy male friend group, I wanted to invite him first. I also asked if she was joking. She ignores this message for a day. J gets back to me later that night saying he appreciated the invite but would feel bad going because he knows how much A likes badminton, saying it would be “unfair on her”.

There was one spot available and it’s a rolling, weekly thing where there would have been many later opportunities (as I expressed in Paris).



I responded to her with “I can understand why you might feel that way. In future I will only invite either of you when there are two spaces so neither of you feel left out.”



She called me backstabby because she expressed she “really likes badminton”. 



I felt this was childish and selfish. So, I ignored it. She later sent, in all caps, “racist and ignor3d!’ She often calls things racist when she’s unhappy, just to be clear. 



This feels ridiculous to me. I think she basically had a tantrum that J and I were hanging out without her/that she wasn’t asked before J. I also think she guilted J into not going, as he was keen when mentioned in Paris.

We live together. It’s overbearing a lot of the time. He’ll wake up in the morning and come hang out in my room or the living room in his boxers and I can smell it when he walks past me. It leaves the smell of swamp ass on our couch. I wish this was a troll post but I am so serious. I don’t know what to do here. He has internal issues, but without giving details away, his farts are WAY more rank than others because of it. He has had to keep track of his bowel movements for a GI doctor. It’s also so bad that his husband (29M) has confided in me that he can’t give him oral sex anymore because of how bad the smell has gotten. He will get off work and it stinks. He showers and within 10 minutes it stinks. I just don’t know how to tell him, or if the blow would be softer coming from his husband. We both want to tell him, because it’s become so bad that we’ve both noticed it and discussed it, but obviously questioning someone’s hygiene isn’t ideal. I think he’ll shut down and be upset either way sadly. We also don’t know the best way to go about it. Or maybe we should do it together? I don’t know. It sucks knowing he has underlying problems that could be causing it, because that makes it even more sensitive of a topic. His husband said that when they do shower together (they don’t always), he noticed that he uses his soapy hand to wash for like 10 seconds and then he’s done with his downstairs. He also has a hairy butt apparently so that doesn’t help.
AITA for even wanting to bring this up? I just don’t want someone outside of us to notice it and make fun of him for it and neither does his husband, and I can’t take the smell myself. Send help.

UPDATE: He gets off work in like an hour or so, and I think I’m just gonna go ahead and bring it up. Y’all are the shit. No pun intended 🌚

UPDATE #2: We talked. It was straight to the point. I told him I was mainly worried about his health, and that I will love him all the same no matter what. He seemed to take it really well! He wasn’t upset or mean, and he didn’t shut down. He was actually concerned his entire person smelled bad, and I told him no, it’s seriously just when he walks past or in places he sits. I’m just glad that he wasn’t upset with me, although I would’ve given him a few days to process had he been mad or hurt in any way. Also, there was discussion about contacting a new GI specialist now that he is at a good job with good insurance. He doesn’t really like the doctor at his old office because he felt he was dismissed with a lot of his concerns, and with this going on, we obviously need someone who will listen. All of your advice helped so much, and I hope this was the update everyone wanted!!

41,1g47rxf,AITA for calling my bf inconsiderate,"After a night at my friends wedding me and my bf leave a bit early. he wanted to go visit a friend at a party they were hosting (which i wasnt enthusiastic about since we hadn't seen eachother all week). Not happy he decides to stay with me anyway but instead of spending quality time he goes straight to bed. I join about an hour later after a shower, walking my dog and some food.

This is where things get interesting, I start snoring in the middle of the night. So my boyfriend gets up to leave because its disturbing him and witj him, he takes the blanket/cover to the living room. On his journey to the couch, he knocks over my 4ft monstera lol which remains on the floor. I wake up in the middle of the night, cold and stretch out my arm to reach for the duvet but I can't see it. I'm like did I kick it off the side of the bed?? I check all sides of the bed twice wondering where tf is this blanket. So I get up and mid sleep I go to him like what's happening? Why did you take the cover? He goes oh because you were snoring so I came out here to get some sleep. I'm like okay but why did you have to take the cover? Keep in mind that I am a pillow and blanket hoarder. My couch has 3 blankets on it and my accent chair has a blanket draped on the back and my office chair has another blanket. So 5 in total exist in the living room and even if he wanted the duvet cover he couldn't even bother to bring a blanket to me for me to use.

I grab blankets for myself and I get into bed. I'm now scrolling on my phone because my sleep is disturbed and I need a distraction and he comes in and asks me if I am okay. I respond no and tell him he is inconsiderate. This shocks him. He goes ""how am I inconsiderate I literally left for the living room because I was trying to be considerate"" WHAT? To whom exactly? I told him you were ONLY considering your needs but not mine. He then says he took it because I wasn't using the cover. When he knows I'm literally always cold and had a moment of being warm.

He apologizes and goes to sleep on the couch and wakes up bright and early to go back to his. I don't hear from him all day. The next day we meet up to chat. It's now Thanksgiving and I'm like let's chat before you come hang with my family so we can iron this out. He proceeds to say that is mad that I called him inconsiderate. Especially after he just spent the entire day with me at my friend's wedding.. I asked him what was the issue because I don't see how a person is anything but inconsiderate when they behave like that. According to him I should've used a better tone and says ""babe in the future can you be more considerate of the fact that i would also want the blanket?"".... am I the asshole for calling it like it is ??

44,1g470eb,AITA for Making My Parents Choose Between Me and My Sister for Christmas?,"So, I (28M) have an older sister (32F) who I’ve always had a rocky relationship with. Growing up, my parents clearly favored her, letting her get away with things I never could, giving her more attention, and constantly making excuses for her bad behavior.

My sister was always the “golden child,” and I was often pushed aside. But, what really made things worse was how my sister treated me. She would constantly belittle me, steal my things, and manipulate my parents into believing I was the troublemaker. I’ve always been the “forgive and forget” type because I didn’t want to cause issues in the family, but over the years, her behavior escalated.

Fast forward to last year’s Christmas. I had just started dating my now-girlfriend (26F), and it was the first time I was going to bring her to meet my family. I was really excited, but my sister managed to ruin everything. She made snide comments about my girlfriend, saying she wasn’t “good enough” for me, made rude remarks about her appearance, and even “accidentally” spilled wine on her dress. It was humiliating for my girlfriend, and I could see she was hurt, but she kept quiet to avoid drama.

After the holidays, I sat down with my parents and told them how I felt. They apologized but gave the usual, “That’s just how your sister is” excuse. I told them I didn’t want to subject my girlfriend to that kind of treatment again and hoped things would change next year.

Well, it’s been almost a year, and nothing has changed. My sister hasn’t apologized or made any effort to be civil. Now, Christmas is around the corner, and my girlfriend and I are invited to the family gathering. I called my parents and said that I won’t be attending if my sister is there, and if they want me to come, they’ll need to choose between me or her.

They’re calling me selfish, saying that I’m ruining Christmas for everyone by making them choose. But honestly, I’m tired of always being the one to make peace and tolerate my sister’s behavior. I feel like I deserve to enjoy the holidays without dealing with her toxicity, especially if my girlfriend is with me.

My parents are pressuring me to just “let it go” for the sake of family, but I feel like enough is enough.

My family doesn't have the means to support me financially so I'm pretty frugal, I avoid debt and always have an emergency savings just to be safe as there is no other back up options (in fact I'm the back up option for my siblings at times )  
I have a close friend Rani who is the opposite, shes easy going and doesn't care about being in debt or living pay check to paycheck as YOLO. Difference is her mother works over time to pay for her bills regularly so she doesn't worry about debt being a problem

Rani likes karaoke and has recently joined an Indian music group as a guest participant (last few months), they're apparently holding a concert now and Rani is insisting that I purchase a ticket and go to watch her sing. Ticket for this concert is $70.  
I told Rani that this was too much and that I wasn't in a position to be able to spend that much, esp as I recently had unexpected costs which shes aware of. She kept insisting that I should go, that she knows I can afford it, & that I'm being a bad friend, ticket price is cheap etc. I told her if it was so cheap, she can give me a ticket but for me it was not cheap. She then started complaining that I should be wanting to support her, that I never support her when she wants to go out to these big events (Not true, in the last few years I've gone to quiet a few ""events"" that she insisted I attend, each costing 80-150, though I don't go to every single one due to how busy I am + cost factor ).  
This is where I may have messed up, I told her that it wasn't a big deal if I didn't go, and when she said ""come on I'll be singing"" I said ""yeah but you're not an artist/singer, you're doing this for fun, its not like this is your career”  
She got really angry at that and said ""just cause you can't sing, doesn't mean I can't hold a concert” she called me an AH, among some other names. We haven't talked since and I'm wondering AITA for saying that. Cost was the main reason why I couldn't go but she kept pushing and wouldn't accept that being as valid and I think I made careless comment, I didn’t think she’d be offended since singing is a new hobby shes picked up and its never been more. So AITA?

Edit: Since many are asking why I didn't just leave it at no - I tried. This wasn't a single convo. We've been arguing over it for several days. Each time its the same convo of her telling me I have to go, she doesn't accept my reasons, she thinks Im being cheap and dishonest ""you're being a bad friend"" is her fav line.

- She sees my emergency fund as having money, in her eyes if I can give money to my family or close friends in an emergency/when they need it, then I must have money to go out too. I've tried telling her that if I had so much money, I wouldn't be working so much (every weekend/days I don't have uni) but she chooses not to believe me.

-Shes pushy any time she wants to go out, this isn't about her singing, she can't take no for an answer for anything, if she wants it and you won't agree to it - you're an awful person.

- Singing is just an activity/hobby (she gets bored v.easily), shes not part of the band, the group is just allowing her (and few other regular people) to sing during the concert,   
  
-she likes to party, dance clubbing etc,  I don't but I've still gone to many things shes asked- to be a good friend but she doesnt care if I have assessments, can't afford the price, have work early the next day.

- Singing is just an activity/hobby (she gets bored v.easily), shes not part of the band, the group is just allowing her (and few other regular people) to sing during the concert,   
  
-she likes to party, dance clubbing etc,  I don't but I've still gone to many things shes asked- to be a good friend but she doesnt care if I have assessments, can't afford the price, have work early the next day. She'll call, pester and guilt trip, say it has to happen despite me saying I cant. It always ends in me feeling shit and her being offended",2.0,0.0131166623905301,0,0
47,1g466i3,AITA for not going on a Thanksgiving trip with my family?,"I Lisa (42F) am married to John (58M). We have four children, mostly adults with no spouses and children of their own. The last couple of years, we’ve traveled for Thanksgiving because family vacations are hard to schedule and there are places that are easier to get to for a shorter trip than our home town.

This month two things happened at about the same time - 1) my husband announced that he’d booked our trip, including a $4K resort in NC without talking to me and 2) I learned that I am 8 weeks pregnant (surprise).

I was pretty lit up inside, but tried to explain my thinking calmly and rationally. I was hurt he’d planned this without talking to me especially since we should be more financially conservative with a baby on the way, I don’t want to go to a place that was just basically wiped off the map by a hurricane, and NC doesn’t have good reproductive rights and I’m carrying a high risk pregnancy. I suggested we go to Vegas because it’s super fun and accessible, less expensive, we can get a good meal, and the reproductive rights there are pretty solid. Plus, I won’t be able to really enjoy places like that for a while after the baby comes.

He countered by telling me that he *never* gets to pick the vacation spot, we have the money, he’s been to Vegas, and we should be supporting NC. Oh, and “just great” he never gets to choose the vacation and it will be even more limited after the baby comes.

I know the risks are generally low, but we work in medicine and I know the CYA mentality. I don’t want to have an emergency with this pregnancy and end up sitting in an ER bleeding, while people debate what they’re allowed to do.

I said, since we clearly can’t agree and there seems to be some baggage here, I’m just not going anywhere and I’m not doing family Thanksgiving.

A few weeks ago, she called me in a panic because she was being evicted. Apparently, she hadn’t paid rent in months and was out of options.

I barely have space for myself, let alone three more people, two of them being toddlers. Plus, Kara has a bit of a track record of not getting her life together, and I worried that ""a few months"" could turn into a much longer, more permanent situation. I told her I couldn’t let her and the kids stay with me because of my living situation, but I’d be willing to help her look for other options, like shelters or low-income housing programs.

She got really upset and said I was being selfish and abandoning her in her time of need.

In the instructions it specifically says no background noise, or other peoples voices, otherwise I will be failed. I ask him if he can be quiet and tell him what the instructions say.

He just leaves the room, which is fine it means that there’ll be no noise at all. I tell him to not enter the room as the door is really noisy, and my phone mic picks up everything, and specifically, do not enter if I’m talking.

I’m in the middle of speaking and he opens the door, walks around the room and grabs his phone. I look at him, he whispers “don’t worry, I’ll be quick.”

I understand that he might need to grab something, but he was so loud. His footsteps were loud, he walked over some clothes which was loud, the door was so loud, and he spoke - to me!!! If the assessor thinks that he’s speaking to me, regardless of what he’s saying there’s a possibility that I might fail.

I finished up, and got frustrated. No yelling or anything, just sighed and told him that I don’t feel respected. I reminded him of what I told him before, and he dismissed it, by saying I won’t fail.

It’s not about failing. It’s about the principal - about coming into the space and making noise then acting ignorant.

To clarify what she wanted, I asked her a bunch of questions over email and she quickly replied to most of them.

We had rarely ever met before this moment, and only after 2 mins of chatting he left me again. So AITA for bringing this up and making this a potential awkward situation?",0.0,1.0348742008209229,1,0
56,1g442zd,AITA for decluttering our COMMUNAL BOOKCASE when my sister was too busy?,"Me (20F), my sister ""Sky"" (18F) and our parents live in a relatively small appartment with an unnecessarily long hallway. Me and Sky have never really gotten along, mostly because she has always been extremely arrogant about her ""not like other girls"" persona. She even got a separate bookfund outside of our monthly allowance to buy books, something I still think is *very* unfair, but when I would bring this up, my mom would say ""you can buy some books, too, if you want"". Which is super unfair, but fine.

All this let to her having A LOT of books, more than could fit in her room. So Sky and my dad build a bookcase in the hallway, and have added shelves when needed. The bookcase is now as long as the hallway, so there is no more space, but she keeps buying books, so it has become overflowing and requires some serious tetris whenever a new one is added. Honestly, nobody really cared until a few years ago, when she started arranging them by colour. My parents found it too busy looking and often asked Sky to throw some books away, or donate them to charity or whatever. She never did.

I recently developed an interest in reading, and Sky always let me borrow her books, but the way the bookcase was arranged was extremely exhausting. Whenever we needed to find a book, we all had to ask Sky, as she knew the colour of the spine and where they were. When I wanted a book and she wasn't home, I had to spend what felt like hours looking for it. Me and my mom asked her multiple times to declutter and arrange it differently, but she always said she didn't have the time.

So I suggested to my mom that while Sky was out on some introductary camp for university, I could rearrange and declutter the bookcase. My mom agreed and helped. We spend four days taking all the books out, getting rid of the ones we knew FOR SURE she didn't like, and rearranged them by author. We even had some space left to add plants and art. It now looks sleek, modern and light.

I thought there were two ways Sky could react to this: 1) she would be pleased we did all the work for her or 2) she would be mad because we didn't do it right. I didn't expect that she would immediately start bawling her eyes out. She wouldn't stop crying, and refused to explain what was wrong. Now, she spends nearly all her time in her room and doesn't talk to us. She seems upset, but I genuinely think she is doing that to make us feel bad, and I'm mad it's working on my parents. My mom tried to bring back the colour arrangement, but Sky told her not to bother. I don't see the problem. The books are much easier to find, the hallway looks more open and organised, and we even get compliments from visitors about the bookcase. It's truly only my sister who is acting weird for no reason. And it wasn't even only her books, some were mine or my dad's!

58,1g43ymk,AITA for telling my dad he should have talked to me before setting expectations about what I will and won't do?,"My dad has me (17m) and my two sisters Lauren (13) and Kyla (9). He's married to ""Jean"" and she has two kids. Conor (12) and Ruby (6). They got married 3 years ago. It was just the four of us for many years before that. Mom died 3 months after she had Kyla. So Kyla never knew her and Lauren doesn't remember her that well. As the oldest and given our dad is... totally imperfect and has more flaws that positives as a dad, I became a sort of parental figure and protective big brother for my sisters. I helped them get ready for school, would walk them to school, would babysit, would help with homework, would let them come into my bedroom if they had nightmares. I raised my sisters more than dad did. Sometimes I even went to doctors appointments with them because dad would be distracted by stuff.

When he got married to Jean, nothing huge changed. My sisters and I stayed close. I did a little less. But I did that stuff for my sisters, not for Jeans kids.

Conor doesn't care and he does his own thing. But he doesn't pay attention to Ruby and spends most of his time with friends or when he is home he wants to be alone. Jean feels bad for Ruby and had told my dad that before. He told her I would always be there if Ruby needed someone and that I was the big brother little girls deserve. He never told me what he said. I never said I would treat Conor and Ruby the same. I speak to Ruby if she's around but I don't go out of my way for her. I don't love her or care about her as a family member. She's more like a roommate in my eyes, same goes for Conor and Jean.

Ruby was having trouble on the school bus and Jean was telling my dad about it. So he told her they'd let me know and I could walk Ruby to school on my way to school. That I did it/do it with my sisters. They assumed I would jump right in but I said no when dad told me. Jean was in the next room listening and she started to cry and she told me Ruby needed me to kick the big brother routine up for her because she feels like nobody wants her at home and she's having trouble on the school bus and at school. She told me I was always supposed to embrace being the big brother to four instead of two. I told her I never said that. She went for a walk because she needed to clear her head. Dad told me he had reassured Jean that I could do it and I was a great brother. I told him he should have talked to me before setting expectations about what I will and won't do and that I would never agree to do all the things for Jean's kids that I did for my sister. He asked why the hell not and I told him the difference is I love my sisters. They are my family. I don't love Jean's kids and I don't see them as family. They're roommates just like he's a roommate more than a parent or family.

He told me I'm showing an unwillingness to grow and a negativity that isn't fair to Ruby. And that my outrage shows that.

60,1g43rcu,AITA for not inviting my friend to a Christmas party?,"In my (30f) wider friend group most of the guys work for the same big company. They have this huge Christmas party every year and us wifes/girlfriends get to go as their +1. While some of the girls also work for different companies, three of us run our own small businesses. 

One day I was chatting with the other two business owners about this years' Christmas party at the big company. One of them mentioned how sad it is that we, small business owners, don't get to have our own company Christmas parties like everyone else. No one is ever giving speeches about how well we've done this year and how grateful they are for our long hours and hard work. So we came up with the idea that the three of us should make our own joint ""company"" Christmas party this year. No big speeches or anything, we just get together, dress up nicely and go out for a fancy dinner. And this time the guys would be the +1s and not us. This is very important to me because I've lived in the shadows of my significant others before. I have worked in the same field or even at the same company as they did, while earning less or having a job title that's below theirs - knowing that I am just as good at what I do, as they were. This party would hopefully lift my spirits and self confidence in my current work.

Now a few days ago, another girl, who is in our friend group but is not a business owner, heard about our plans and she told one of the girls that we hurt her feelings because we (specifically me) are excluding her from our Christmas party. Truth be told, she is not my favourite person. There has been beef between us before, and if it was up to me, I would not invite her anywhere. I am only friends with her because my friends are. But I do take care that she doesn't feel left out, I always invite her to gatherings where the entire friend group is invited, etc. She is not the only one in our friend group that has not been invited. And it's not like she's missing out, since they will have a company Christmas party at her workplace too - to which we are obviously not invited. I don't want to invite her to our small business party, but the others feel bad for this girl and want to invite her.

There's a lot of TBD because she wants to find the perfect venue first. But she's getting married internationally. Her dream for years was a destination wedding.

I have three children. Three children with complex needs because they were in the foster system and still have trauma from their experiences with their birth family (they are bio siblings) AND with their former foster families. If the wedding was in the US I could make a destination work if I could be gone for 24 hours or thereabouts. But this would require at least three days and potentially four or five if there are delays or complications with flights. This just isn't feasible with where my children are at and their progression is not fast enough for me to say they'll be fine when the wedding comes along.

Our brother (28M) has a young baby at home and is also unhappy with the no kids rule at a destination wedding.

My sister and I were always close and she wanted me to be her maid of honor and to help her plan her wedding. I was upfront with her that I can help her plan the wedding if she wants BUT I cannot attend given the child free part of the wedding and the fact it would take me away from my family for several days and not just a 24hour ish period. She told me I could find a way to make it work and my husband could manage on his own. I told her that's not how things work. She said our brother hates it but can leave his baby alone with his wife for the time it takes. I reminded her that my children are not babies and have significant trauma.

She told me if I really wanted to be there I would make it work. I told her I cannot and that is not something I can fix. She told me to try. I told her it will not work and I was telling her for the sake of honesty and transparency. But I would not let her shame me into changing my mind.

She began to invite him to hang-outs with our mutual friends and I. That wouldn’t have been a problem if he hadn’t negatively commented on our bodies, and appearances. He would also call us rude names and slurs.
Nobody would talk to Sam about it, so I decided to step up. I texted her, saying Jack was rude and that he was a bad guy. Sam said she’d talk to him and I accepted the answer. Even after this, Jack continued to be horrible to my friends and I while Sam turned a blind eye.
After a while, I snapped and confronted her. I said his behavior was crude, and that he should apologize. I also said that she should re-consider her relationship with him, and that she would lose friends if she didn’t do anything about him. Sam was livid. She called me immature, sensitive, and nasty. She said I was jealous because I had nobody to love me like Jack loved her. I attempted to explain myself, yet she simply didn’t care.
I could see how I could be the a hole in this situation. I could’ve just sat back and ignored him instead of creating this whole situation… but I wanted her to see how he had been affecting myself and our mutual friends.

But he always comments on how disgusting it is, asks how could we even eat that and he gags for the whole meal. He never even tried that food! We argued about it a few times, because I think that he's behavior is unacceptable, but he sais that this food is just horrible and he's allowed to have preference. Four days ago, at a family dinner when my mom asked him if he would like some gołąbki (google translates it as a cabbage rolls, not sure if it's the same thing) he one again gaged, coverd his mouth and said that he could never eat that. I was furious with him and told him to apologise. He refused and there was a tense mood throughout the rest of the lunch. After lunch it was time for a dessert. My mom made sernik, whitch is simillar to cheescake, but it's made with cottage cheese. My boyfriend refused to try that before, but this time my mom covered it in chocolate so it looked a little different. When he asked what's that, I quickly said that it's some store bought cake. My family didn't correct me and we all ate in peace. My boyfriend even took a second piece! He asked where we bought that. Then I told him that it's sernik that my mom made with cottage cheese. He looked at me a little confused than told my mom it is good. I was happy with the result of my litte lie, but on our way home he started yelling at me, how could I humiliate him like that in front of my family and how could I lie about what he's going to eat when he already told me that it's disgusting. I asked him what his problem was because he liked the cake, but he said that I didn't respect him and his boundries and he's not talking to me until I apologise. It's been four days, he's not answering my massages and I'm having doubts if he's right? AITA?

He's not allergic, doesn't have any intolarance and he isn't on diet that would made him not to eat a sernik btw.

Edit: O wow, I didn't expected so many comments in two hours. Thank you so much for all of them! Many questions why are we together? I study in Spain, met him at a university and he and his friends are kind of my spanish family now. He is usually a sweet and funny guy, just not a Polish fan. We visted my family for two days, Friday and Saturday, and when we were coming back to Spain he snaped about sernik. Not sure if I continue this relationship but it's scary to be alone in forein country and lose almost every friend I have now. Is sernik worth it? He's still an amazing boyfriend who cares about me, light up my day... If you ever been in love you would understand the feeling. Still not sure if I should apologise, because his behaviour was very childlish and disrespectfull as many of you said, but lying wasn't the best option so I think I'm guilty of that

Edit 2: Oh my this already have over 1500 comments, I try to read as many as I can but cannot promise anything. Anyway, thanks for the responces, it opened my eyes a lot and made me do some actions. I talked to my parents about this, apologized for bringing him with me and not kicking him out. Also disscused with them his behaviour towards me and them. I found out that not only he was disrespectful about the food but when I went to the toilet and my family tried to engage a conversation he was just noding or shaking his head, without trying to response properly. I texted him that we need to talk face to face and if he's not gonna answer me by tomorrow, I'll end it by sending him a message. Do I have another choice?

Since we met almost 1 year ago, he never tried any polish food that me or my family prapered for him. If he just said ,,no thanks"" I would be fine. But he always comments on how disgusting it is, asks how could we even eat that and he gags for the whole meal. He never even tried that food! We argued about it a few times, because I think that he's behavior is unacceptable, but he sais that this food is just horrible and he's allowed to have preference. Four days ago, at a family dinner when my mom asked him if he would like some gołąbki (google translates it as a cabbage rolls, not sure if it's the same thing) he one again gaged, coverd his mouth and said that he could never eat that.

He became avoidant and said that he had too much on his plate right now to have a conversation and said that we could talk in about a week and a half. So I held out and waited, meanwhile the same issues persisted. Once the date rolled around that he said we could talk, he said that he was too focused on other things and that we could have a conversation in another two and a half weeks.

I asked him why he had to do it this way, stringing me along not having a meeting to talk about things for an entire month and then rather than hearing me out, just cutting me off with no conversation or resolution. He said that he knew that I wanted to address some frustrations when I asked to have a conversation, and he didn't want that to distract him from the things he had on his plate. He preferred to avoid having the conversation so that I can still be around to do my job while things were busy and that he planned to let me go once the conversation finally happened, but he put it off as long as possible so that I could still be around to do my job before that happened. I felt incredibly resentful as I spent an entire month waiting to have this conversation, meanwhile I was given the runaround, and come to find out that they planned to let me go the whole time and were just waiting for a convenient moment for it to happen.

65,1g42wez,"AITA for assuming I was invited to my cousin's wedding, and ""making a scene"" when I found out I wasn't?","My (18f) cousin's (22f) wedding was this weekend. I'll call her Mary. Growing up, we were pretty close, as me and my siblings (20f and 23m) often went to Mary's house. Lately, we haven't seen each other much, because all of them moved away for college, but it's still nice to see each other at family events.

A year and a half ago, she met her now husband. He was invited to Christmas, Easter, and every family event since then. When he was there, I noticed that Mary was a lot more distant than usually and barely talked to me but talked with my siblings all night. I figured it was probably just because of our age difference.

A few weeks/months ago, we got an invitation to their wedding in the mail. Or at least my parents did. My name wasn't mentioned on the invitation, which was addressed to ""The *ourlastname*s"", but since I still live with my parents, and my brother and sister both got one, I assumed I was included, and so did my parents. But Mary's face dropped when she saw me. She pretended to smile but I could see something was bothering her.

The wedding went on, but during the cocktail Mary came up to me and asked me why I came, since she didn't send me an invitation. I was taken aback a bit, but told her that we assumed I was included, and  asked her why she didn't invite me. She avoided the question, but after insisting a bit she told me that she wanted her husband's family to have a good impression of her family, and didn't want them to know that her cousin was a lesbian, because she wanted to have a ""normal family"".

For context, our family is pretty open minded, and all of them accept me, but her husband and his family are a lot more traditional and conservative. What I don't understand is, I don't ""look gay"" (whatever that means), and they would've never known unless someone told them.

I was so shocked. I told her that she was sick for caring about impressing a bunch of bigots more than her own cousin. She got mad at me and we both got a bit loud, which attracted attention. People came to find out what was happening. When they found out, my parents said that she was being mean and shouldn't have made a big deal about this. A bunch of other people said that it was wrong of me to come when I wasn't invited. Mary started telling me to leave, so I stormed off.

Since, I have been receiving texts from her and her parents saying that I was a bitch for coming, making a scene, and ruining her big day. I understand that it's her wedding and she can invite whoever she wants, but her words were so hurtful... And I genuinely thought I was invited. But I know it's wrong that I caused such a scene on her wedding day. Maybe I should've just left and not said anything?

The kitten is lively and well adjusted by now, but the more days pass, the more my allergies act up, especially since I'm actively taking care of it with my mother.

67,1g429kp,AITA for asking my nieces to return their mother's old toychest?,"I (30F) have asked my nieces, we'll call them Ann(34F) and Grace(30F) to return a toy-chest that was given to my sister, let's call her Lily, when she was little.

It was made by our Grandpa, he made them for almost all the grandkids. I'm the only one of the grandkids who never got one. There’s a more than 25 year age gap between my sister and me. By the time I came along, Alzheimer's disease had stolen Grandpa from us. He barely knew who any of us were anymore and he died before I turned 2.

My sister died in 2016 due to a medical condition we didn't know she even had until it was already killing her. She was supposed to have surgery to repair some of the damage it had done, but the hospital screwed up and she never made it off the table.

When she died, my Grandmother called my brother in law (let's call him Dave) to see if he would return the toychest to her, planning to save it for me when I had kids since I never got one. Dave said ok, and they made plans for my Dad to come get it and bring it to my grandma's place the next morning, but when Dad got there, Dave told him that just an hour or two after he'd talked to Grandma, the girls (referring to Ann and Grace) had come and taken all of their mother's things out of the apartment, including the toychest. He said that he told them Grandma had asked for it and that he'd already told her she could have it, but they took it anyway.

Now, my nieces do have kids, but, 1 when they were little, my Dad (their grandpa) made similar toychests specifically for them, did the same for each of their kids when they were born. 2, at this point, their kids no-longer play with the kind of toys that would be kept in a toychest, it's all about videogames. So they don’t have a use for it. Even if they did, they each already had their own anyway, and I do mean each kid as well as both nieces.

I didn't find all this out until 2 years ago as far as my Grandma trying to get the toychest back and the girls just taking it despite knowing that their step-father had already agreed to return it. At the time, I didn't want to do anything that might stir up the waters, but I'm done waiting for them to do the right thing.

I reached out to my younger niece on Facebook to see if I could reason with her. I assumed she was the one most-likely to still have it, since the youngest kid is hers. I told her why I wanted the toychest, I'm the only grandchild who never got one, that not only did she and her sister each get one from my dad but so did each of their kids. Plus it's a piece of both my sister and my grandfather. She called me an asshole, accused my dad of being a bad father/grandfather, and went offline.

I then messaged her sister and explained the situation as well as what had just happened. She messaged back, claiming to understand my perspective but that she had to side with her sister before blocking me.

69,1g424aq,"AITA for not agreeing to go to a secondary vacation residence after two friends got ""kicked out"" the first one?","My friends and I had booked a four person residence for our vacation but we were with six total people. I wasn't involved in the booking and didn't know about this. The other five did however. Shortly after arriving the owner of the place comes over and gets (justifiably) angry with us for being with six people in his four person residence. We tried bargaining with him but he wasn't having it and told us that at least two of us had to leave. 

We weighed our options and tried finding another suitable residence in the area but couldn't find anything at first. We then decided that we would draw straws to determine who would stay and who would go home. I got to stay and shortly after we drew straws, one of the two friends that had to go home suddenly found another apartment in the area. 

I thought it was a bit shady that all of a sudden he was able to find another place, but we started checking out the photos and price. The residence was much more (at least twice as) expensive as the one we had originally booked and it was in the middle of some town. I think it was a part of someones house? Anyhow, the residence we had booked was in the middle of nature. That was the whole idea of the trip anyways, to spend time in nature. 

Everyone except me agreed to go to this secondary residence. With the stress of it all, being annoyed by the fact that my friends had booked a four person residence for six people, my suspicion of the friend that suddenly found another option, and the fact that I just didn't want to spend that much money, I denied to go there. 

I told my friends that if they were to go to this other residence, I was going to go home. I was fine with that decision. They then decided that we were going to go with the option of sending two people home anyway, and then my two friends left. 

Ever since, they have been holding me accountable for ruining their vacation by denying to go to this other residence and saying I would go home if they chose to go there.

My friends and I had booked a four person residence for our vacation but we were with six total people. I wasn't involved in the booking and didn't know about this. The other five did however. Shortly after arriving the owner of the place comes over and gets (justifiably) angry with us for being with six people in his four person residence. We tried bargaining with him but he wasn't having it and told us that at least two of us had to leave. 

We weighed our options and tried finding another suitable residence in the area but couldn't find anything at first. We then decided that we would draw straws to determine who would stay and who would go home. I got to stay and shortly after we drew straws, one of the two friends that had to go home suddenly found another apartment in the area. 

I thought it was a bit shady that all of a sudden he was able to find another place, but we started checking out the photos and price. The residence was much more (at least twice as) expensive as the one we had originally booked and it was in the middle of some town. I think it was a part of someones house? Anyhow, the residence we had booked was in the middle of nature. That was the whole idea of the trip anyways, to spend time in nature. 

Everyone except me agreed to go to this secondary residence. With the stress of it all, being annoyed by the fact that my friends had booked a four person residence for six people, my suspicion of the friend that suddenly found another option, and the fact that I just didn't want to spend that much money, I denied to go there. 

I told my friends that if they were to go to this other residence, I was going to go home. I was fine with that decision. They then decided that we were going to go with the option of sending two people home anyway, and then my two friends left.

70,1g4218f,AITA for blocking my cousin with no explanation.,"I (27) female and (28) female have always been close. Because we are so close in age we grew up doing everything together. We accomplished a lot of milestones together. About 2 years ago my cousin started seeing a new man. It was a very odd relationship and nobody knows really anything about him. She became pregnant shortly after and I was there for all the events. But the more time went on she got distant and more distant. We completely just stopped talking besides holidays. But life happens I get working and being a mom and stuff. Cause I too have a child and work. 

Flash forward to December (2023) I got engaged and a  week later was her son’s first birthday party. I show up and while talking to one of our mutual friends and her congratulating me…my cousin decides to say she’s been engaged for a while but they’ve just kept it hush hush (she didn’t even have a ring)… I let her have her moment because I know she was also recently diagnosed with a personality disorder and I also knew she was making it up. 

Flash forward to my wedding (July 2024) she decided to leave my wedding to go to the LIQUOR STORE to get a fifth of Tito’s and said “I’m getting drunk because my man doesn’t let me do anything” I was completely rubbed the wrong way that she used my DAY to make it about her and getting waisted… and let me mind you we did have alcohol at the wedding already. 

Still not really speaking after that in September (2024) my daughter started her first T-Ball season. She reached out wanting to come.I told her where it would be and we made plans…and of course she doesn’t show up… she apologized asked to come to the next game instead and then doesn’t show up to that one either. I’m very protective over my daughter.. cancel plans on me but don’t promise my daughter and hurt her feelings not once but twice. I was fed up at this point so I reached out and told her how I felt and how different she’s been acting ever since she got with “fiancé” and she replied wanting to meet in person to talk about everything so that way things don’t get misinterpreted through text. (Makes sense) I agree. We agreed to meet that Sunday coming up and low and behold I sent 2 text messages and she never responds. So I decided to block her and go no contact am I the asshole?

74,1g40xh9,AITA for “exposing” or my best friend?,"Hi, I’m a 16 year old in high school. I have a best friend, who we’ll call Molly. She is actually one year older than me, in her junior year.

For some background context, Molly and I have been friends since third grade. We’ve known each other practically forever. We’re apart of the same soccer team, she is constantly over at my house—I took care of her when her mom passed away. 

When we got to high school, nothing changed. We were still on the same soccer team, still best friends, had mostly the same friends.

I also started dating this boy named “Arthur.” 

When me and Arthur dated, Molly became more distant. Not sure why—one day she left practice early, and ever since she’s started eating somewhere else during break. Every time I ask her, she completely changes the subjects.

I’ve noticed, that at least once or twice a month—this boy will come up to our table and ask to sit with us, and Molly is always mean to him in response. Not saying I’m not, I’m no angel. He’s just one of those weird kids. Let’s call him Dian.

Anyway, I had my sweet 16 a week ago. During the party, I caught Molly and Arthur doing some stuff.

I decided to be emo and post it on my Instagram page, to which Dian dm’d me. He told me how him and Molly were dating, that she was just embarrassed of him because he was autistic.

So I did the only logical thing, post it on my Instagram story. Then, I posted it on TikTok. It got taken down. So I posted it again, then I messaged a few people. Then I told a few teachers—then a few other people. 

People are calling her weird, and she sits alone during break and lunch now.

So now everyone knows, and quite frankly, I thought she deserved it. But seeing her sitting alone makes me sad, abnormally sad. Seeing her not show up to soccer practice makes me want to turn back time.

I only know the bride from meeting her a handful of times. There would be times I'm talking to the wife and then she would run off to chat to someone else. So I would go off and admire the scenery and architecture of the building. When it was time to start heading  into the building we get in and there's a polaroid camera for guests to use and put into the wedding book. Wife asked me to wait while she went to the restroom. Waited a good 15+ minutes, she comes back we get a photo. She then says I need to go to the restroom, and wait for me out the front of them. There were a lot of people around and I lost sight of her. I stood out the front of the restrooms for 20mins I move to the end of the hallway and see her at the tables chatting with people. I walk over to her and was like wtf, she said sorry she hadn't gone yet and then went. She then proceeded to tell the mother of the groom and other people that I'm pissed with her. People I've never met before which made me feel like a piece of shit. Not much said to eachother throughout the night and then she was constantly pulling my wrist over her shoulder to be in weird positions, I asked her to stop reefing because it's causing more nerve pain.

On the dance floor she full on reefed at my arm. Hurt like hell and I walked off.
We talk sporadically throughout the night but were basically separate most of the time. I talk with a couple of guys most of the night. One of them and I go up to the bar to get another drink. My wife's infront and asks if we want drinks. I said yes please, she gets drinks while we're waiting she's about to do shots with friends, she turns around and asks us if we have phones she can use to do take photos/videos. I said yeah, you put your phone in my suit jacket. I pull it out and go to hand it to her (last gen silver iPhone pro) at the same time of me doing this the guy I was with had his phone out too, she takes his phone to use. He was like wtf wouldn't she just use hers. Anyway after this they have to exchange numbers to send it all. The guy high tails it out of there. Wife said she though I was giving her my phone (piece of shit that is horrible at photos, but in a bulky black case and looks nothing like hers in size or colour). Was last drinks also.
So alarm bells are ringing from here. We go for a walk through the gardens and then to the pick up point for ubers. She then walks 3-4 meters away and waits. I walk close and she walks further away. So I was like fuck this and started to walk back to the hotel.

Told her that I felt like I was treated like a fucking idiot the whole time and the only reason I can come up with for grabbing the other guys phone is his number. She argued for ages that if the roles were reversed she wouldn't care because she would just think I'm drunk.

76,1g40m6b,WIBTA to force my roommate to pay my utility bill?,"I (F18) am a college freshman living off campus. I live in an apartment with three girls, specifically with one I’ll call Lana (F19). The apartment lease says it’ll pay 30 bucks each month for electricity and charge us if we ever go over that amount, and in August, we were charged $4 each. 

…Then in September, we were charged $20 each. Yikes?! That’s a big jump of price to me when my other two roommates and I have been trying our best to save power. Lana got mad about it a few days ago, saying that she always unplugs everything after she uses it and rent is already too expensive for her. This pissed me off: Lana has an electric scooter, a coffee maker, a hair dryer, a griddle, and an ice maker even though our fridge has an ice maker. She also uses the washer dryer several days a week and uses her hair dryer for a while (tonight she used her hair dryer for OVER 40 MINUTES while on the phone!). She uses a lot of electricity for someone who can’t afford it!

We are trying to be patient with her and make up for whatever electricity usage she needs by minimizing our own. My roommates have stuff themselves like mini fridges, so they’re especially trying to be fair with Lana, but I don’t have anything that uses electricity besides my phone/computer chargers and two lamps. I’m extremely frustrated that I have to pay 20+ dollars when I not only try my best to save electricity, but barely have anything that uses much power. I’ve tried everything from charging my stuff on campus, avoiding doing my laundry until I run out of clothes, not using the microwave, anything. I am getting mad and desperate.

I’m horrible at math and science—I don’t know how much this collective electricity usage could be, I can’t calculate the watts and whatever it’ll cost, but I’m pretty sure it’ll be a lot and I feel like I’m going to lose my mind if our bill gets any higher. I don’t know if it’s moral or even legal to force my roommate to pay my share of the utility bill, but at this point I’m genuinely considering it because I don’t think this is fair to me. Call it stupid but Lana using that hair dryer for 40 whole minutes was the thing that drove me over the edge. I don’t want to pay money for a charge I have fought tooth and nail to try and avoid when it wasn’t even me using the electricity.

I will be upfront in saying I don’t like her. We don’t get along for many reasons, too many to get into in this post.

77,1g40l8n,AITA for expecting my dad to support me more after getting kicked out,"So really long story short my parents divorce(mom cheated and she got custody). When I was 17 she kicked me out and threatened to call the police. My dad 2 hours away took me in and I immediately got a job. I only had one semester of senior year left and as soon as I turned 18 that may he informed me he would no longer be helping me out financially what so ever but as a “ graduation gift” he would pay for 2 years of my community college and I can stay rent free until the end of those 2 years only because he doesn’t want me to have renters rights and because I would be getting kicked out at the end of those two years of community college.

Outside it doesn’t seem so bad but here’s my problem. I’ve had numerous doctors appointments trying to fix the damage my mom did. This includes long list of dental bills, doctors visits, a procedure, vaso vagal( pass out when stressed),PTSD, anxiety, and a personality disorder that I all get meds for, and getting diagnosed unrelated medical issues that weren’t diagnosed because of medical neglect, monthly psychiatrist visits, and malnutrition.

When I was 17 she kicked me out and threatened to call the police. My dad 2 hours away took me in and I immediately got a job. I only had one semester of senior year left and as soon as I turned 18 that may he informed me he would no longer be helping me out financially what so ever but as a “ graduation gift” he would pay for 2 years of my community college and I can stay rent free until the end of those 2 years only because he doesn’t want me to have renters rights and because I would be getting kicked out at the end of those two years of community college.

Outside it doesn’t seem so bad but here’s my problem. I’ve had numerous doctors appointments trying to fix the damage my mom did. This includes long list of dental bills, doctors visits, a procedure, vaso vagal( pass out when stressed),PTSD, anxiety, and a personality disorder that I all get meds for, and getting diagnosed unrelated medical issues that weren’t diagnosed because of medical neglect, monthly psychiatrist visits, and malnutrition.

78,1g40fyz,AITA for asking a family member to delete a Facebook post about my dead grandmother ? ,"**Update**: **As I’m reading your comments I’m understanding a more objective point of view. Some of you certainly have your choices of words but I understand them. I can’t delete this post but as I can understand I am the asshole. Thank you for your output.**


My (26F) grand-mother (78) passed away last night after a complication from heart surgery. She had a stroke during the procedure and after a week of not waking up and us waiting for the swelling of her brain to go down, the brain scan showed us that the brain suffered too much damage. We decided to go let her go peacefully. She died with no pain or recollection of this ever happening.  

As you can imagine, we are heartbroken. Especially me, as I was SUPER close to her as the eldest grandchild of an Italian family. I loved her with all my heart. I am not processing this well and I am very angry and in no contact whatsoever with any of my family members to protect myself. I am in fight or flight mode right now. I know this is not the right way to grieve but this is how I am mentally and physically reacting to this. 

I deactivated all my social media accounts (FB, IG, and Messenger) so no one can come in contact with me. As I opened back my Facebook account earlier today, I realized that my grand-mother’s niece (let’s call her Maria) announced on her Facebook page (tagging my father and my uncle) that my grand-mother passed away. She still lives in Italy so she’s not often in contact with us. 

I was fucking livid. Mind you that she also did the same thing when my grand-father (my grand-mother’s husband) passed away two years ago almost to the day. 

I immediately contact my father to tell him what’s going on and that he must ask her take down the post as she’s violating our privacy in this very difficult time. He tells me that it’s out of his control and there’s nothing he can do. He’s her next of kin so he’s taking care of everything right now. He’s super busy and has no time to take care of this. 

Well, I told myself that I will control this situation. 

So I decided to send her a firm but very polite message asking her to take down the post as she’s violating our immediate family’s privacy and she took away from us the announcement of her death, that we wanted to make in a nice Facebook post with her obituary (this can take many days.) 

As I thought, Maria took it very badly and she told me that she’s also her family so she’s also sad and wanted to remember her (she posted an AWFUL picture of my grand-mother, like the kind of picture that you’re not aware that you’re being photographed, with food in her mouth at the dinner table.) But she agreed to take down the post. I happily replied that although her words were very kind, right now was not the time, and that I would love her to put her post back up AFTER we announced her passing. 

So, AITA for maybe fighting with a distant family member about “outing” my grand-mothers passing before all of us? Is this because I’m protecting my grand-mother’s dignity ? Or I’m just being angry and looking for a fight ? 

I apologize if there’s any grammar errors, my native language is not English.

79,1g40co3,AITA for agreeing to my sister not coming home?,"I (16 f) have a sister (13 f). She recently started acting out and not being remorseful. Just a couple weeks ago, she snuck a boy in the house. Something she's never done. Didn't say sorry, look sorry, feel bad for the trouble she got me into or nothing. She went out and tried being fast before and being the big sister I am, I've warned her about the consequences of her actions, in which she chooses not to listen. She lets her friends talk bad about me whenever she gets upset with me. To my face, in front of her. She also goes behind my back and rats to my mom and stepdad about me saying things I don't even think about doing. I've been hospitalized twice due to my mental health and she chooses to make that a reason to make fun of me. Also my adoption is clearly something she just *has* to tell her friends about. Shes gotten many of her friends in trouble for not being responsible. She's also gotten herself in trouble for not being responsible. Needless to say, I have messed up and did things, but at my age its not frowned up on because things like this are expected. But I've never done a FRACTION of the stuff my sister has done. My mom got fed up and my stepdad didn't feel safe so they sent my sister to my grandmas house. She doesn't live far; 30 minute ish drive. This weekend was her first weekend there, and I visited also because my mom and stepdad had their anniversary. Today before I got picked up, my sister asked if she could go home and I told her ""Mom's not gonna say yes you know that"" very angrily. I think she got upset or offended because she walked out. When my mom called to let me know she was around the corner, she asked to speak to my sister in which I gave her the phone. I listened to their conversation for a minute and then walked out eventually to gather my belongings so I could go home. When I got in the car I had realized my sister had talked smart mouth to my mom and it made me mad. I expressed to my mom how peaceful and calm I felt not being on edge or anxious I felt without my sister being around when it was just me my mom and my stepdad.I know she's a kid and might be going through stuff, but she gets mad at anyone, and I mean anyone, that tries to help her get over whatever it is. She's had a good childhood and leads many of us to think about why she's acting like this.

I guess my sister dislikes me more now because I got to go home and she didn't.

P.S. My mom has collitis and it flares up whenever she gets stressed. That's why I stopped acting out but recently it's been my sister. She won't sit down, shut up, and be a kid. She wants to be 18 so bad and anybody I could ever think about to persuade her to be that way is her raggedy decision of friends and interest in wanting to fit in with everybody around her. We've tried therapy, taking her phone, private school, no extracurricular, almost everything in the book. And I can see my mom struggling to run in 10 inch stilettos when she has a 13 year old trying to trip her every effing day.

80,1g406cr,AITA for getting annoyed by constantly doing things for my friends?,"I, 17F and my three friends also 17F have been friends for about 5 years. I got my drivers license about a year ago and have been driving my friends around since. We live in a big city so there are plenty of places we wanted to explore without our parents being our source of transportation. It was also just nice to stay as long as we want at a location and leave whenever we wanted. I had a lot of fun in the multiple months of freedom that I had with my friends; we went to thrift stores, malls, the beach, etc. But since the beginning of the summer of 2024, I’ve noticed a shift in my willingness to do things. Driving is exhausting and especially when I am the only one doing it. I’ve started asking my friends to help me pay for my parking or gas, especially when we I am driving to multiple places, and they were willing to help me out a bit. But the driving still persists and my two of my friends have had their permit long enough for it to expire. They would tell me that they are super busy and their parents don’t see them driving as a priority, which I understood in a way but at the same time I am equally as busy yet I got my license. I’ve started to become less giving in other ways because of this. Examples: Sharing my food, I used to always share my food without a thought and now I’ve become more protective over it. Dropping and picking people up, I’ve started telling them that I can’t drop or pick them up but I also get a bit annoyed when they ask to get dropped off at my house before we go somewhere or getting picked up from my house (sometimes I just want to drive alone to a location, hang out with them, and then leave by myself). I am also the go-to house to sleepover at when we go to parties. One of my friends never lets us at her house, my other friend has not exactly strict but just weird parents with weird rules, and my third friend lives pretty far from us. I understand it’s partly because of circumstances but sometimes I want to get ready and go back to a house that isn’t mine after a party. Additionally, I am the person who is constantly paying for things. It’s not like they aren’t paying me back but I am always the one paying first. I mostly go out with two of them, excluding the one who lives far because she is either busy or doesn’t have a ride (because she can’t drive). The problem is besides my friend who can’t usually hang out with us, I am the only one with a credit card. So when we are at a restaurant I pay in full and they pay me back. When we postmate food, I pay in full and they pay me back. When we watch a movie, I pay in full and they pay me back. The two friends have debit cards but their parents rarely give them enough money to suffice them for a full day of going out, or they carry cash. The movie part is a big thing for me. One time me and the three friends I see the most wanted to see a movie that came out recently. One of my friends (the one who doesn’t let us go to her house) really wanted to go. I decided to do an experiment and take a back seat in the making of these plans. I asked the friend who really wanted to see it to check the seats. She checked them and sent it to us and then selected where we would sit. The total was like $60 for the three of us. At some point when we got to paying for it it went silent. I didn’t offer up my card so guess what happened…. We never went! I’m so sick of paying for everything whether their parents Venmo me back or not. It’s not like they are using me maliciously or that our friendship is sheerly transactional, the main reason why I put myself through so much driving is because I love hanging out with them. But to me it’s not the fact that I’m just paying for things because I know they will pay me back at some point, it’s really just the effort that’s being put not to mention the constant reminding of my friends of how much they owe me.

82,1g3zrok,AITA for not really wanting to pay a commission ,"Hello everyone, I am a bit new to cosplay and commissioning in that field so please be nice. Just to start of, I have ALWAYS paid my commissions that I have made in the past. 
But I am having a bit of a conflict here with this one. 

I’ve commissioned a Wig artist with about 1k+ followers, for a cosplay i was planning to do. I was aware that Wig commissions are a bit pricey but I was prepared to pay a good amount. When I first talked to the Artist, they said the minimum price would be about 200€. Which I found reasonable for the type of Character Wig I was asking for. I paid for the base wig as well, which was about 30€. 
I’ll also let you guys know that the person told me I wouldn’t have to pay anything upfront until the wig would be done. So I haven’t made any payments (or signed any contract) 

Now the issue, they recently finished their work I was semi-happy with it. It’s not really as accurate to the character as I hoped for, (and the artist didn’t really try to make the changes I’d expected them to do (that I asked him to do or at least try to do), I’d decently would have to make changes myself), but I told myself it was fine for a 200€ wig… 

That was until they told me the final price would be 400€. Which put me in a slight shock. Since I was not informed thru the entire process that there would be that insane price changes. I expected to pay a little bit more maybe for shipping or extra labour or something. 

Again the price was only mentioned once, at the start, that was the only time thru the entirety of those 4 weeks, again the minimum 200€. They never mentioned any changes or heads ups about any changes in the price or asked if I was okay with the price until the end of the commission. 
Before anyone says something, I get the word minimum, it’s how me and my hairstylist communicate when I want a new Hairstyle example: 
„Hey I want this, how much would this cost“ 
„a hairstyle like this with this and that would be 150€ minimum“ 
And I ended up paying like 180€. 

I think it was a bit of a language barrier mainly. 
Now I feel kinda bad that I don’t really want to pay 400€ for the wig. But I don’t necessarily want to pay 400€ for a wig I am not really 100% happy with and might need to change myself as well.

We used to hang out and talk daily, and I was always there for her when she needed me, but lately, the past 4 months, she just hasn't been talking with me.

She started dating a guy across the country, online relationship, about 4 months ago. I'm happy for her since she hasn't had much luck in relationships, but, I feel like I've just never gotten to talk or hang out with her anymore. When we do talk, all it's ever about is her boyfriend now, or her venting about having to do some things she doesn't want to. We never get to just talk about life. We used to lean on each other for support, but I feel like I'm not even there for her except as somebody to vent to anymore. I consider her my best friend, she's really my only friend.

It's been getting worse over the last 2 months, I noticed that she was getting more distant from me 3 months ago. She's always talking with him on the phone nowadays, and it sucks. She gets mad at me if I try to even interact with her when she's on the phone, and when we aren't in classes at college or working, she's on the phone talking to him. I've tried to talk to her about it, but she always brushes me off when I try to.

89,1g3y219,AITA For telling my mom I refuse to watch anymore tv shows or movies with her? ,"I (33F) and my mom (60) got into an argument the other day.

It’s an argument that we have had multiple times.

For the background I have movies nights with my brother, I have movie nights with my sister, & a movie night for all 3 of us, as a way stay close & hang out to relax.  
For the record on the movie nights we play games, card games, or just talk, & (me & my brother occasionally drink on our nights) then when it gets dark we start our movies. 

Now, none of us have ever been close to our mom even though we have tried over the years. 
Hell, my sis is low contact with her. 

My mom complains that we( all 3 of us) never talk to her, never want to spend time with her. 

She refuses to play board games, refuses to play cards, doesn’t drink(which I understand). 
We even asked her what she would like to do together & she never responds. 
So we try to watch shows/movies with her. 

Every-time, we to watch something with her, she is ALWAYS on her phone. 
Which I hate in general, especially if I haven’t seen whatever we are watching. 
But she’ll barely look at the tv, & when she does she asks questions that she would know if she just got off her phone & WATCHED! 

Well, the other day she asked to watch a new episode of show with me, & I reluctantly agreed. 
Not even 2 minutes in & she’s on her phone. About 10 minutes in & something happens in the show, & she looks up and asks me questions about it. 
I told her if she got off her phone & watch she would know. 
She told me she can multi task & she can do both. 
The show carries on, about 15 later she looks up and asks questions again!

I was so tired of this, she always does this, & then gets mad when I don’t want to watch something with her or I watch it before her.

So I snapped. 
I told her “if being on her phone was more important to her than “bonding” with me after she begs & nags to spend time together, then she can watch her fucking shows with her phone & leave me out of it because I was done, that I wasn’t watching anything with her again.”

My sister & brother think it was fine, but one of my cousins said I was being an asshole.

We should’ve deescalated stuff but everyone was just annoyed and really concerned about how this was going to end up when they break up again. I was also very hurt that she would date someone who she knows actively disapproves of her friends. Everything escalated and me and Lia said that we didn’t want to go to hoco with her anymore. That sounds like a stupid small thing, but she doesn’t have many friends at school(we’re outside of school friends) and I know she’s really hurt that we wont go with her. I’m just so emotionally tired of this guy and all his shit, it feels like she becomes a different person when she’s around him. I feel horrible because we are really close friends and I love her so much, but this relationship is getting to be too much for me.

We’ve tried sitting down and talking about our concerns, which she just turns into arguments, we’ve tried just ignoring it but when they’re dating he’s all she’ll talk/complain about and whenever they break up she gets really sad for a few weeks. I just don’t know what to do anymore.",0.0,0.0040168855339288,0,1
93,1g3wsht,WIBTA For trying to stop a name change? ,"Okay okay, normally I’d say off the bat that’s a dick move, but there’s context.

Me:
- I am (16FTM)
- I am a diagnosed AuDHD 

My friend
- 16 M
- He speculates that he has autism but has not been given a formal diagnosis

This week we have a school holiday and I wanted to hangout with my friend, and asked him this the 1st day of this month to which he said that he thought that he might be on holiday that week. (N's family is rich and usually goes on trips during school holidays, however he would know about a month beforehand if he was going on a trip or not). However, I did not press further. Finally on Saturday I asked him if he would like to hang out with me, he said maybe and sent me a meme that he uses to give me an idea that likes to do activity based hangouts because he has autism, to which I gave five suggestions that he could use and he left me on read. Finally I picked one and he said that he wanted to do it but that he would have to check with his parents because his mom would be out of town that week to see if he needed a ride to my house and back. He didn't answer me and said he would check with his parents. About a day later on Sunday I asked him again and he said he wasn't so sure because he was going out the next day with friends, I was slightly annoyed and asked him again to ask his parents. Then when I asked him again today he said he still hadn't asked his parents. This frustrated me because my parents yell at me about last minute things and not having them fully planned out. This pissed me off and I went off at him in the following text message.

96,1g3who0,AITA for ruining family dinner?,"This is my first post on this subreddit so I’ll try my best for formatting.

My (F18) family was getting together for a “Thanksgiving dinner” with all my siblings which doesn’t happen often. I put Thanksgiving in brackets because we don’t really celebrate, it wasn’t a big meal or anything, just pasta and my mom figured it would be nice to all be home either way.

The people at dinner were both my parents, my three siblings and my boyfriend. For context, two of my siblings are younger, and I have one older sister (F20). We got along fairly well as kids but kinda drifted apart as teens since we are quite different. 

During the dinner, everything went well, however as I was cleaning my plate my older sister asked me if I had lost weight because I looked skinnier. I’ve always been pretty underweight but I have dealt with these comments my whole life so I try not to let it bother me. I don’t really know why this bothered me so much this day but I wanted to stand up for myself and show how a comment like that is unnecessary and rude. So, I turned it around and said “how would you feel if I said you looked like you gained weight/were bigger?” Obviously that is a cruel statement and I wasn’t legitimately asking but trying to show how it feels the other way.

Now I may be the asshole here because my sister had definitely had some issues with her weight over the years, thinking she’s bigger than she is. My mom came downstairs after dinner and was upset with me for “ruining the dinner” by making a comment like that because my sister was just trying to be nice. I tried to explain to her that it’s mean to comment on another’s weight either way around but she told me any girl would be happy to hear that someone thought they’d lost weight. I, again, tried to explain that maybe SHE feels that way but I don’t, and my sister made fun of my weight my whole life. She would tell me boys would never like me cause I wasn’t curvy and even had me in her phone as “anorexic girl that lives with me”. 

All in all, my mom is upset but my boyfriend says i’m not in the wrong. So AITA?

97,1g3wcxm,AITA for not splitting my college fund with my dad's affair child?,"My father dropped a big bomb on our family last year when he revealed that he had a secret son from his affair years ago. After my mom found out and gave him the ultimatum, he cut things off with the mistress and she moved away until last year when she introduced him to their son Hank. I really don't give a damn about his latent father instinct since he didn't give his other family any consideration when he broke the news. Thank god my mom divorced him and now neither my brother Connor (M 18), sister Sophia (F 15), or I want anything to do with him anymore.

Here's the thing though: We have a shared college fund that my mom's parents set up for us when we were little. My parents contribute almost half of the money and my maternal grandparents contribute the other half. The account remains under my mom after the divorce. As far as I know, he stopped contributing to that account after the divorce.

Last month, I found out that my dad’s been harassing my mom because he wanted to add Hank as a beneficiary to the college fund for my siblings. He's saying that Hank is his son and therefore entitled to the college fund that he set up for me, Connor, and Sophia.

My mom told him off and now he has been going around harassing her online and to their mutual acquaintances and friends, claiming that she is ""heartless and cruel for taking her anger out on an innocent child."" And then, he also had the genius idea to reach out to me to put pressure on my mom. He said I should consider opening up my heart to Hank who grew up without a father and wasn't set up in life like my siblings and me. I left him on read since honestly, the things I wanted to say to that callous evil monster may be too much.

Yesterday he changed tactics and now said he wanted to withdraw all his part of the money from the account, divided them to make sure Hank has his share and deposited the rest back into the account. (With the caveat that since Connor and I didn't need to use the college fund for tuition since we both had fullride scholarships, the money would be divided into 2 parts- for Hank and Sophia, instead of into 4 parts for his 4 children).

And now him, some of my dad's side of the family, and even the mistress are pressuring my mom to agree to that. And I'm praying that she won't.

It physically makes me angry that we're being asked to split our money with my dad's affair child. Even if yes, I don't need to use the money to pay for school, I will need it in the future. Same with Connor! And I know for a fact he would never use the same reasoning to exclude Connor and I from the fund just to have the money solely for Sophia in the same situation. It's all for Hank.

I understand that Hank is innocent and not responsible for his parents' actions but I don't think of him as my brother. Hell, I don't even think of my father as my father anymore to be honest. As far as I'm concerned, my family consists of me, my siblings, and my mom. That's it.

So, AITA?

edit: I'm 23, Hank is 14

Update: 
Thank you so much everyone for the support and advices. I really appreciate it. 

I talked to my mom this morning about getting the lawyer involved and also about a potential restraining order. She has been talking to the lawyer about dad’s demands and it looks like he really doesn’t have any rights to it. I think some of you are correct that he is doing all this because he knows he won’t win in court. 

As for a restraining order, mom is hesitant to do it right now since dad has visitation rights with Sophia and she doesn’t want to make it too complicated for my sister. But she promised me that if things get worse she will get one. 

My brother Connor and I also talked and we will be taking turns coming home for the weekend so mom and Sophia won’t be alone just in case anything happens.

Some clarifications: 
We haven’t involved mom’s parents since their healths aren’t the best right now. Grandpa was really shocked when he heard about the cheating + secret son of dad that he had a heart attack. Thank God he mostly recovers now. However, none of us want to put stress on him. 

According to dad, he never knew about Hank’s existence until last year when his mistress came back. Nobody in our family knew really until dad brought Hank to a family event to break the news to us. He blindsided and humiliated my mom and it was the final straw for her. They divorced after that. 

I honestly don’t hate Hank. It’s just that right now I can’t imagine spending time with him. He’s a minor still so everything will have to involve either our father or his mother. And that is a no for me right now. Perhaps in the future, things will be different. Who knows. 

Hopefully things get resolved soon. Thank you everyone again for the amazing advices and words of support.

They’re very religious, white collar/highly educated (my mom is an accounting attorney & professor, dad is an engineer), and they had a similar vision for me. Aside from that — they don’t value sports, trade skills, hobbies, or anything I value really.  

Lately, I've been trying to be closer to them, but they're not making it easy. Earlier today I went over there for a late lunch/early dinner, and they did a lot of criticizing me. Why do I waste my time with my hobbies (kickboxing, archery, rockclimbing), why do I waste my money on cosmetic stuff (houseplants), why am I not going back to school, why am I in dead-end jobs, that I could be more successful, why am I with my fianceè whose so uneducated, etc etc. 

I got a bit terse with them eventually after enough questioning. I kinda snapped and laid it all out for them. 

Told them I’m a 22yo with 2 degrees (associate’s degree in physical therapy assisting & bachelor’s in exercise science), working full-time in a fulfilling job that pays well for my age ($27/hr as an inpatient rehab physical therapy assistant). I’m also a certified group fitness instructor & personal trainer, doing that on the side for $50/hr, sometimes more. I have a fixer-upper house that I’ve been repairing, teaching myself all sorts of handyman skills & acquiring tools. I'm decent at basic plumbing, electrical, woodworking, drywall, landscaping. I’m in a healthy relationship.

They’re very religious, white collar/highly educated (my mom is an accounting attorney & professor, dad is an engineer), and they had a similar vision for me. Aside from that — they don’t value sports, trade skills, hobbies, or anything I value really.  

Lately, I've been trying to be closer to them, but they're not making it easy. Earlier today I went over there for a late lunch/early dinner, and they did a lot of criticizing me. Why do I waste my time with my hobbies (kickboxing, archery, rockclimbing), why do I waste my money on cosmetic stuff (houseplants), why am I not going back to school, why am I in dead-end jobs, that I could be more successful, why am I with my fianceè whose so uneducated, etc etc. 

I got a bit terse with them eventually after enough questioning. I kinda snapped and laid it all out for them. 

Told them I’m a 22yo with 2 degrees (associate’s degree in physical therapy assisting & bachelor’s in exercise science), working full-time in a fulfilling job that pays well for my age ($27/hr as an inpatient rehab physical therapy assistant). I’m also a certified group fitness instructor & personal trainer, doing that on the side for $50/hr, sometimes more. I have a fixer-upper house that I’ve been repairing, teaching myself all sorts of handyman skills & acquiring tools. I'm decent at basic plumbing, electrical, woodworking, drywall, landscaping. I’m in a healthy relationship. 

I feel like I'm doing pretty fucking well, parents less obsessed with education & status would recognize that, and my fianceès parents do. I told them that almost verbatim. They got pissy and I left abruptly at that point. ",0.0,-0.0071230707690119,0,1

101,1g3vf1v,AITA For Calling Out My Brother Years Later?,"Me (21F) and my brother (21M) used to have a decently close relationship considering we're twins. But our personalities and social lives have always been drastically different. I'm not very socially intelligent, I try to be but I always manage to mess up in the moment. Additionally, I'm autistic.

One day (we're both 17 at the time), I'm delivered some pretty nasty news about our cat and I go to deliver the news to him. He was near his friends at the time, and I didn't want to embarrass him (bugs were my hyperfixation at the time, so I was considered the weird kid), so I almost just left. But I assumed he'd want to know the news so I went forward to tell him anyways. I'm maybe a few words in before he turns around, sneers at me, and says; ""Go away, r-slur"". 

I left. I just felt so hurt and since then, it hasn't felt the same with him now that I know how he really feels about me. It's been a few years now since the incident, but one day during a family event, my mother was laughing about how close we used to be and wondered why we had drifted apart.

I told them the full story and everyone's smile just vanished. Everyone just seemed a little embarrassed and the next day I was bombarded with texts from my brother and a few other family members. My mother told me it was immature to bring up something that happened when we were teens and accused me of holding a grudge. My brother pointed out that he'd just said it because I was an embarrassment during my teenage years and that now that I'd 'changed' (aka just started masking more) it didn't matter.

We rented out our home, and moved in to her house with our senior dogs start of the year, with the promise of her renovating the basement to a full functional house with everything we need. That never happened. We decided to tell her in July its best we move back home after a year as she was not able to fullfill her promise, and we need our own space and that was not going to happen clearly. She was silent and never said anything. refused to listen more to my wife who wanted to help with coordinating scheduled so she could still help with the kids after school.

Aug. 1st she just sent via text to move out that weekend, and would tell the kids we were just on vacation but she wanted us out of the house ASAP. It was devestating and a surprise. Especially how close we are to the kids. My wife made quick arrangements to stay at our close friends. IT was decided i would move 2 hours away with our dogs as i work from home and staying with my wife's mother was the best option while she stayed with our friends in town as it was down the street from her work.

So here’s the story: a close friend, let’s call her Sarah, has been obsessed with becoming an influencer for the past two years. And when I say obsessed, I mean it’s all she talks about. She spends hours every day taking selfies, recording TikToks, and posting about products that no one’s buying (her words, not mine). She’s barely making any money from it and has had to borrow cash from me a few times to cover her rent.

I’m all for people chasing their dreams, but I’m watching her crash and burn. She refuses to get a real job, keeps saying she’s “this close” to blowing up, but it’s been two years and…nothing. I’ve tried being supportive, but last week, she asked me for money again. This time, I told her she needs to stop living in la-la land and get a job that actually pays the bills because I’m tired of bailing her out. I said, “Being an influencer is like being a YouTube singer—everyone wants it, but 99% of you aren’t cut out for it.”

She got super pissed and accused me of not believing in her dreams. Now she’s giving me the cold shoulder and our mutual friends think I was too harsh. I just think I’m being realistic and saving her from drowning in delusion.

108,1g4l394,AITA for not dog sitting anymore after going unpaid,"I sometimes house/dog sit for my friends family as they are travelling a bit to see their kids at school etc. I’ll come after they leave and stay at the house and walk, feed, care for the dog etc (list of requirements to do for the dog is quite lengthy) and do things such as tidy up the house (full sink of dishes, cleaning floors etc). I even had someone come out and fix something (that was not working when I arrived) that would’ve been pricey, at no cost to them. A lot of my time would actually be spent cleaning their house. 

They pay me ~$50 a day which is great. When I am unable to sit, they have to put the dog in a boarding kennel which is ~150 a night (so having me essentially saves them $100 per night that they’re gone). 

My issues is they haven’t paid me twice now. In the winter I stayed for 4 days and was left unpaid. I didn’t say anything because it’s awkward asking for money you were promised especially when it’s a friends family. I just stopped doing things such as cleaning their entire house top to bottom (it was always a mess when I would get there) and stopped being as available/saying yes and cancelling my own plans for them. And again recently I stayed for one night (had family dinners and did not want to miss seeing family) so the dog didn’t have to spend the entire weekend in a kennel ($$$ for them) and they even texted me today but did not pay me. 

I didn’t say anything last time about being unpaid as I love this friend and don’t want to seem rude in any way asking about that (I hate talking about money it always feels rude), so I just stopped missing out on my own things to dog sit for them and stopped cleaning the entire house when I would stay there. After not being paid this time, I kind of feel like I’ve hit the point where I’m done housesitting for them because I have to drive places for the dog, take time out of my day, have a further drive to school etc and I don’t want to have to remind them to pay me. 

If this was a family I was super close with, I would do it free no questions asked. But I’m not super close with them so it’s an awkward between of knowing my friend too well to say anything, and not being super close with them where I could casually mention it. Every time they ask me to dog sit now I wanna say no cause I was left unpaid twice, but then I get in my head and think that’s awful of me and I should just be doing it out of the goodness of my heart (even tho I save them $100 a day) and I shouldn’t feel entitled to the money they told me they’d pay. I don’t ever wanna ask what I’m owed as I keep telling myself it’s not that deep, but then again I feel my time is almost taken advantage of. I hate having to ask people to pay me what’s owed. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-15,"AITA for not dog sitting anymore after going unpaid I sometimes house/dog sit for my friends family as they are travelling a bit to see their kids at school etc. I’ll come after they leave and stay at the house and walk, feed, care for the dog etc (list of requirements to do for the dog is quite lengthy) and do things such as tidy up the house (full sink of dishes, cleaning floors etc). I even had someone come out and fix something (that was not working when I arrived) that would’ve been pricey, at no cost to them. A lot of my time would actually be spent cleaning their house. 

They pay me ~$50 a day which is great. When I am unable to sit, they have to put the dog in a boarding kennel which is ~150 a night (so having me essentially saves them $100 per night that they’re gone). 

My issues is they haven’t paid me twice now. In the winter I stayed for 4 days and was left unpaid. I didn’t say anything because it’s awkward asking for money you were promised especially when it’s a friends family. I just stopped doing things such as cleaning their entire house top to bottom (it was always a mess when I would get there) and stopped being as available/saying yes and cancelling my own plans for them. And again recently I stayed for one night (had family dinners and did not want to miss seeing family) so the dog didn’t have to spend the entire weekend in a kennel ($$$ for them) and they even texted me today but did not pay me. 

I didn’t say anything last time about being unpaid as I love this friend and don’t want to seem rude in any way asking about that (I hate talking about money it always feels rude), so I just stopped missing out on my own things to dog sit for them and stopped cleaning the entire house when I would stay there. After not being paid this time, I kind of feel like I’ve hit the point where I’m done housesitting for them because I have to drive places for the dog, take time out of my day, have a further drive to school etc and I don’t want to have to remind them to pay me.

109,1g4l303,AITA for refusing to meet with strangers and request my best friend apologize to my boyfriend for badmouthing him,"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for a month, after a year of being romantically involved. Throughout this time, we've had several disagreements, particularly concerning my best friend, with whom I share a sexual history. My boyfriend set strict boundaries for maintaining that friendship, which I initially found challenging but ultimately agreed to respect.

When I met up with my friend, she expressed her hurt about the situation and ended up drinking, despite my boyfriend's clear rules. She criticized him heavily in front of two strangers who took her side, and while I didn’t defend him at that moment, I later realized I needed to stand by him more firmly. I had conversations with both my boyfriend and my friend about this, which led to a temporary cutoff from my friend. Thankfully, our friendship improved later on.

However, my boyfriend keeps bringing up that night during our conflicts, which prevents me from addressing other important issues in our relationship. He insists that I find a way to meet the two strangers who supported my friend to clear the air, a request I find unreasonable due to my social anxiety. Additionally, he wants my friend to give him a face-to-face apology, which I feel uncomfortable facilitating.

I'm feeling increasingly conflicted about whether his requests are controlling and how to balance my commitment to my boyfriend while also maintaining my friendship.

We don’t reside together but have a loving, supportive and easy relationship. 
My BF and his ex wife, we will call her Susie have a very positive and friendly relationship. For the first 4+years of our relationship, I admired and respected their coparenting arrangement. It took some getting used to for me as she would walk into house unannounced and unexpected, make herself comfortable, often with friends in tow to spend the day by the pool or hang out on the deck.

I asked Carl to start paying me back bi-weekly, but he didn't follow through. Instead, he went on vacation with his girlfriend.

Recently, Arthur and I planned a group trip at the end of September, which coincided with my birthday. A week before the trip, Carl told me we needed to reschedule because he couldn't afford it and needed to pay me back. This was the first time he mentioned the money since our agreement.

I’ve been busy with moving and renovations, and I felt it was unreasonable for me to accommodate Carl’s schedule. I thought it was a good opportunity for him to make it up to me, considering I was very patient with Carl not paying me back and so I expressed this to him. I told Arthur that he and Carl could go without me but I wont be able to come in October if things got rescheduled, as I wanted to set boundaries—something I rarely do.

Arthur accused me of giving him an ultimatum. The next day, he sent me a long message saying he was ending our 15-year friendship and to not contact him or his family again.

We live a 1.5 hour walk from campus/approx. 1 hour on the bus due to huge queues, and driving takes 15 minutes. Jo bought a car over the Summer and I drove mine back to our Uni town for the year, given the lower commuting time. The costs are higher but we both felt it was worth it for final year.  


For context, Kate and I both live in London and last Summer I was driving back to our Uni town in order to move out of my previous house. She had been in London for the weekend and asked if I could bring her back so she didn’t have to pay for the train (c.£25). I agreed but she wanted me to collect her from her house which would easily add an hour to my trip as we live in different areas. I said I was happy to drive but she would have to come to a station nearer my house where I could collect her. She did this but was unhappy, bringing up the fact I did not ‘prioritise’ her on multiple occasions since. She also did not offer me any fuel money for the 3.5 hour drive. On previous occasions I have paid for things and she has not sent me the money she owes me, and I find it hard to broach the subject. 

Now, we started back at Uni 2 weeks ago and Jo and I have been letting the others know what time we are headed to campus if they want a lift. They largely come with me as Jo is in less often. Alice offered me fuel money after the first week and sent it to my account, however Kate offered me nothing. She offered Jo money but then never sent it. Kate also gets into the car, does not say a word the entire journey and then does not even utter a word of thanks when she gets out. I am not in need of money, however I feel like I am being treated poorly given she cannot even say thank you.

A few days ago Kate told me that when a coursemate brought her to and from campus she paid her £3 for the return journey. She again did not mention giving any money to us. I mentioned this to Jo and together we agreed it would be best to send the others a message asking for the same amount, to help pay for fuel and parking, and felt it was fair given it was less than the bus. We let Alice know beforehand and she felt it was a good idea.

A few days ago Kate told me that when a coursemate brought her to and from campus she paid her £3 for the return journey. She again did not mention giving any money to us. I mentioned this to Jo and together we agreed it would be best to send the others a message asking for the same amount, to help pay for fuel and parking, and felt it was fair given it was less than the bus. We let Alice know beforehand and she felt it was a good idea. Since sending the message, Kate has been ignoring us and acting very angry, she also has stopped taking lifts from us and has instead been going with her coursemate.

117,1g4hoha,AITA for being worried about my friend?,"So, our trio recently got into a big fight that ended with one of the members, who I will call Marie, deciding to leave 3 days before her birthday party. I (17f) and the other member of the group, who'll be Claudia, (18f) recently noticed that Marie had been ignoring us, or trying to avoid us on a Thursday right before a long weekend. (Keep in mind, her birthday was that Sunday). That weekend, (Saturday night) Claudia’s parents had to go for a trip, and she slept at my house that night. We had invited Marie, but since she said she was busy and it couldn’t be canceled, Claudia slept over. At around 2:30pm, Claudia texted Marie to ensure she was okay. Basically, the message was asking if she had offended her and that if she had, it wasn’t at all on purpose, and she was more than willing to give her any space she might need. Marie read it in 10 minutes, but she didn’t respond. Since Claudia and I are both very anxious people, Claudia texted her at 3 pm saying she just wanted to talk to Marie, which she also ignored. Since Marie has a history of mental health struggles, Claudia and I got pretty worried for her. That night, she sent a text at 9pm asking to meet up for lunch the next day, and when we asked what was wrong, she said that she “hadn’t relapsed,” which made Claudia and I quickly get much more worried about Marie. At lunch the next day, we arrived (extremely worried) at the restaurant, giving her a gift (since it was her birthday). She called us out and talked about how she was feeling left out of our group, and was unhappy with how we'd been acting. Keep in mind that Claudia and I are seniors, and Marie is a junior. We love her, but it can sometimes be hard to hang out with our clashing schedules. Anytime we meet up *outside* of school, we make sure to invite her as well as keep any conflicts from her schedule in mind. We spend all of our lunches together and rarely hang out without her (only when it's unavoidable). She called us immature, and we agreed to try to improve for her and include her as much as we could. The next day at school, I was sick, but Claudia told me about how Marie had ignored her all day, continuing into Tuesday when I came back. That night we reached out again, asking more firmly for Marie to tell us what was bothering her and her actions. To be honest, it was a passive-aggressive message because we were done with her ignoring us and acting like we hadn’t been long-term friends. She replied by calling us immature, rude, dramatic, and in the wrong for worrying about her when she didn’t respond. She also mentioned her mental health a lot, and made us feel extremely guilty for not noticing when she was struggling even though she tried her hardest to hide it from us. She seemed genuinely apologetic in the text, and ended it by saying that she wouldn’t be spending time with us for the rest of the week, and her birthday party (which is 4 people total) was canceled for the near future.

My parents know that we are dating but are also quite conservative and don’t know that I go to his house to hangout as well because he lives alone. Hence, whenever we have to hangout I always have to lie about where I’m going and that is a bit unsettling to me. Plus since I have a curfew I can’t really hangout past 9/10 PM outside. So, because I’ve brought him home before and they’ve met my bf, I thought the best idea to meet my bf is just to hangout at my house and just keep it very PG 13.

A few months back we were hanging out at mine until midnight just playing board games and my family got pissed off at me saying you can’t have him at home until midnight and that I’m doing something wrong as my parents live at home and it’s really uncomfortable for them with him staying so late at home. They basically said he can’t come home past 8 PM after that.

125,1g4bhs0,WIBTA if I dna tested my neice. ,"I (30 f) am fostering my neice (lilly 8 f) and nephew (landon 7 m). I have 3 children of my own with my husband but we do still plan on adopting Lilly and landon as the cps case is coming to a close and the parents are unfortunately both not fit to care for them. 
This is now where I think I mite be the asshole. Lilly has medical and mental problems/ disabilitys. we have been working with doctors to do our best to help her have a normal life. Many of these things do not run in the family on there bio mom or bio dad side. That made my husband and i start wondering if we were missing something. During a drive i randomly remembered Lilly bio mom told me about hangout with her ex During the beginning of the relationship with the kids dad. I decided to look up the ex. (I'll call him matt). Matt unfortunately passed away in 2019. But the moment I looked at his photo I new he is probably Lillys real father. 
The bio mom has always said my brother is both kids bio dad. There was also a dna test done on landon when he was a baby so we no for a fact my brother is the dad. 
I want to dna test Lilly so that we can find out if anything she is dealing with is genetic and or if there are things we should look for. Also if there is any surviving family i would want her to have the opportunity to get to know them. 
I want to make it clear that no matter what her dna is I will love her no matter what! 
Unfortunately with cps still being involved i can't do a dna test unless I bring it up to them. But if I bring it to there attention it could 1 delay the case and 2 I'm scared cps will take Lilly away from me and give her to a member of Matt's family. 
And even if I wait till we have adopted both Lilly and landon the dna test could cause major rifts in the family. We already have pfas on both the kids bio parents, my mother and most family won't speak to us due to taking the kids in so they wouldn't be with strangers and fallowing cps rules. 
I want to give all my children, landon and Lilly include, the best chance at life. But would it be best to just leave it alone or should I get the test done? 
I feel like I will get  it done after the case is completely closed and we have adopted the kids. But would I be the asshole?
EDIT- I think it important to add afew details i left out. Lilly was with her bio mom and my bother till she was 5 she is now 8. I have had her since she was removed from there care. But even befor the kids were removed Lilly and her brother were with me 90% of the time. I was even there in the room while the children were born. With that being said I have a strong bond with the kids, I'm the only one that has protected them and looked out for them, the kids call me mom which is there choice they no I'm there auntie they choose to call me mom. I love them like they are my children and treat them no different than my own. I want to add that growing up I did not no who my biological grandfather was due to my father being a affair baby. I had a tethered spinal cord at birth and a clubbed foot. This dos not run on my mom's side or my dad's mom's side. Though I did take a ancestry dna test and found out who my bio grandfather is. He had unfortunately passed away but I was about to talk with family and discover my medical problems ran on his side of the family! I also learned other things that run in the family so that I'm aware if me or my children develop any signs. With all that being said I think its important that Lilly medically gets a dna test done so that it will give us clarity and she will understand as she gets older instead of being in the dark like I was. I also think its important that she gets the chance to no Matt's family if they are indeed her blood. I also don't think its fair to keep her from matts family or them from her. And if i was to wait till Lilly is a adult like many have suggested it mite be to late for the grandparents to no they had a granddaughter. However she has already lost most of her family once cps got involved and if she was taken from me and placed with them it would cause her even more pain so I will wait till the adoption is done if I do anything.

I have 3 children of my own with my husband but we do still plan on adopting Lilly and landon as the cps case is coming to a close and the parents are unfortunately both not fit to care for them. 
This is now where I think I mite be the asshole. Lilly has medical and mental problems/ disabilitys. we have been working with doctors to do our best to help her have a normal life. Many of these things do not run in the family on there bio mom or bio dad side. That made my husband and i start wondering if we were missing something. During a drive i randomly remembered Lilly bio mom told me about hangout with her ex During the beginning of the relationship with the kids dad. I decided to look up the ex. (I'll call him matt). Matt unfortunately passed away in 2019. But the moment I looked at his photo I new he is probably Lillys real father. 
The bio mom has always said my brother is both kids bio dad. There was also a dna test done on landon when he was a baby so we no for a fact my brother is the dad. 
I want to dna test Lilly so that we can find out if anything she is dealing with is genetic and or if there are things we should look for. Also if there is any surviving family i would want her to have the opportunity to get to know them. 
I want to make it clear that no matter what her dna is I will love her no matter what! 
Unfortunately with cps still being involved i can't do a dna test unless I bring it up to them. But if I bring it to there attention it could 1 delay the case and 2 I'm scared cps will take Lilly away from me and give her to a member of Matt's family. 
And even if I wait till we have adopted both Lilly and landon the dna test could cause major rifts in the family. We already have pfas on both the kids bio parents, my mother and most family won't speak to us due to taking the kids in so they wouldn't be with strangers and fallowing cps rules. 
I want to give all my children, landon and Lilly include, the best chance at life. But would it be best to just leave it alone or should I get the test done? 
I feel like I will get  it done after the case is completely closed and we have adopted the kids. But would I be the asshole?
EDIT- I think it important to add afew details i left out. Lilly was with her bio mom and my bother till she was 5 she is now 8. I have had her since she was removed from there care. But even befor the kids were removed Lilly and her brother were with me 90% of the time. I was even there in the room while the children were born. With that being said I have a strong bond with the kids, I'm the only one that has protected them and looked out for them, the kids call me mom which is there choice they no I'm there auntie they choose to call me mom. I love them like they are my children and treat them no different than my own. I want to add that growing up I did not no who my biological grandfather was due to my father being a affair baby. I had a tethered spinal cord at birth and a clubbed foot. This dos not run on my mom's side or my dad's mom's side. Though I did take a ancestry dna test and found out who my bio grandfather is. He had unfortunately passed away but I was about to talk with family and discover my medical problems ran on his side of the family! I also learned other things that run in the family so that I'm aware if me or my children develop any signs. With all that being said I think its important that Lilly medically gets a dna test done so that it will give us clarity and she will understand as she gets older instead of being in the dark like I was. I also think its important that she gets the chance to no Matt's family if they are indeed her blood. I also don't think its fair to keep her from matts family or them from her. And if i was to wait till Lilly is a adult like many have suggested it mite be to late for the grandparents to no they had a granddaughter. However she has already lost most of her family once cps got involved and if she was taken from me and placed with them it would cause her even more pain so I will wait till the adoption is done if I do anything.

I (15 M) have a friend group in my congregation, composed of me and other four people who I'm not gonna give the names beacuse of personal reasons, but each will be given a letter as a identification. So it is,  ""M"" (14M), ""J"" (15M), ""C"" (13M), and me, ofcourse.

My friend ""C"" is taller and I could even say stronger than me, even though he's younger. That same friend is thru an ""anime phase"" that dosen't seen it's gonna end soon. But, as he looks more mature than his current age, people, including me, expect him to act as so. But, recently, he has been acting very, and I say VERY, immature. An example of this is, one day we were at the church, and instead of staying at the front with the others, he was at the back playing in his phone.
Today, during our weekly meeting, our leader decided to make a dynamic which consisted in puting several strips of paper with diferent topics in an urn, topics as ""can you date during adolecence?"", ""how to be a responcible person?"" and ""how to follow Crist instead of the carnal pleasures of the world?"". Until this moment, everytingh is ocurring great, but during the explanation, friend ""C"" and friend ""M"" were talking and giggiling in the back of the class. Our leader had already asked for silence one time, then I also asked then to be quiet. They persisted thil the end of the meeting, making me and our leader kinda sad. In the end of the reunion everyone got up to pray, while I was standing up with my backpack on me, ""C"" started opening my backpack and taking my things out of it, I was already tired since I had just gotten back from work then I said:""dude, let's have the minimum of maturity and respect right now. I'm not okay. Stop."" After that he gave me my stuff back while mocking me. After that I just whent home.
