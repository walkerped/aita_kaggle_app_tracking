0,1g3yqhc,AITA for calling my sister selfish and immature? ,"For context, about 3.5 years ago my sister came out as transgender (m to f) and moved out of the house less than 24h later. She refused to tell my mom or dad where she was living and expected me to keep the secret. My parents knew she came out and accepted her fully right out of the gate, no questions asked, and were confused that she didnâ€™t want them to know when she lived. Eventually, she let my mom know where she was living and now they have a great relationship. I kept my promise and never told my parents or anyone where she was living. Throughout these 3.5 years my dad has been extremely respectful of her privacy and her wishes to not have a relationship; ofc he still loves her and will text her occasionally to say happy birthday, how is school going, etc. to which my sister will send a thumbs up as a response. To be clear, my dad is respecting her boundaries although he doesnâ€™t understand why my sister thinks he is not accepting of her. 

This thanksgiving weekend my sister came back home to visit and as usual, expects my dad to be out of his own house the entire duration of her visit. My dad has been staying at a hotel and truly doesnâ€™t mind as he wants to respect her wishes. 

I am bothered by this and think it is stupid that he should have to move out of his house every time she visits, specifically because my sister refuses to talk about or explain her reasoning for hating my dad. My dad has always been awesome to both of us, supported us through mental health struggles, taken us to our favourite concerts, supported us financially, etc. and I truly do not understand what she has against him. 

AITA for telling my sister she was being unreasonable and she should be the one staying at a hotel during her visit? AITA for telling her Iâ€™m done talking to her until she will have a mature conversation about why she hates my dad?

Here is where I think I am the AH:
I understand as a cis-woman my relationship with my dad and the world around me is very different than my sisters and I might not be acknowledging her feelings or taking into account the intersectionality of her identity.",POO Mode Activated ðŸ’©,2024-10-15,"AITA for calling my sister selfish and immature?

1,1g3v6k5,AITA for asking my friend to gender me correctly in French?,"Both my friend and I are French Candians, though my friend rarely speaks it anymore outside of when he is with his family. French, unlike English, is a gendered language and when my friend talks about me he'll refer to me as his ""ami"" which is the masculine for friend instead of ""amie"" when texting his family and will use masculine words when talking about me to them. I find this especially rubs me the wrong way as I am trans and it's just something he could do to be nice. 

I asked him if he would just make an effort to not screw that up, especially when talking to others, as it really bums me out when he does it and I know he doesn't mean to offend me. However, his response was that he doesn't care and neither should I and that really put me off. According to him he is just bad at grammar in French and would screw that up for a cis person as well. Again, I just told him it would really mean a lot if he could remember to gender me correctly and he again just deflected by saying that he isn't good at grammar. 

This ended up frustrating me and I told him that this was equivalent to him consistently misgendering me in English which isn't something he does and I'd like him to at least try to do the same in French. His response was that I need to calm down and that I'm being over dramatic over this. He's made it clear that he doesn't want to even try as he says it's too hard and that I should just drop it as he rarely ever speaks French anyway. He told me I'm making mountains out of mole hills and told me I need to calm down about this.
