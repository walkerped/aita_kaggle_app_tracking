She's said she doesn't want someone who watches 'videos' because it shows he can't control himself, he's too lustful and it's cheating mentally. I've said I'd ideally want a girl that hasn't sent 'pictures' because I don't like thinking there's guys out there with them on their phone (I know this is normal to send in couples, so not too hung up on it).

I know both of us are being demanding with each thing, but I think she's being way more demanding than me, especially considering how many people watch 'videos', but feel free to disagree. A while ago she send she doesn't send 'pics', but more recently she admitted she did send them to her exes. I asked why she lied but we agreed that maybe it was a miscommunication since it was just a passing comment. She said they deleted them but realstically I don't think so (based off of how she described them).

What bothers me:

* She was willing for guys she said treated her badly. Yet she's said she's the most comfortable/soft/feminine she's ever been with me and she feels closer with me already than anyone else.
* We're in a long distance relationship and 'solo missions' are normal for everyone no? Fair enough if she doesn't want me to watch 'videos', but if not those, and not 'pics', then what? And why send 'pics' to them but not me?(again, not obligated, but obviously i curious) I'm just very confused & conflicted. But I don't want to disrespect to her.

i(24FTM) used to work as a baker. while growing up i never had any allergy but after those 3 years in the bakery i started reacting to some mystery food. after a few weeks of trying out different foods to pin down what it was it ended up being cinnamon. the thing is i never really reacted strongly to it, just always had some slight trouble breathing and having a weird feeling in my throat and mouth but it always went away on its own, so i never went to seen an allergist or got an epipen or anything. i just stopped eating cinnamon the past four years and never had any breathing problems again.

now on to the current problem, i’m really careful about not eating anything with cinnamon or anything that could have touched anything containing cinnamon. people around me constantly tell me i’m overreacting and am way too careful, that with such a little reaction i shouldn’t act like this and since i never got it tested there could even be no allergy at all. my family is constantly annoyed that i won’t eat food that has “only a little bit of cinnamon” in it. 

just today i asked if we maybe could not place the cinnamon cookies with the other cookies this year at christmas so i could also eat some cookies(not like last year), just to be told it’s not gonna kill me if they touch. yeah i don’t think it will kill me either but i’m terrified of having this feeling of not being able to breathe again, even tho it was not that strong.

7,1g572dt,AITA for not dressing up as Scooby-Doo for Halloween?,"This entire situation is really weird to me, so I am in search of some advice.

For the past few years my (18 F), best friend (19 M), let's call him Daniel, has been participating in his neighborhood's ""Trunk or Treat"" event. Which is basically where you decorate or theme your car to pass out candy for the trick or treaters. People will do anything from SpongeBob to Super Mario themed cars, and Daniel has always loved participating and decorating his own car.

This year, he was struggling to come up with ideas, and asked me if I'd participate with him this year. I agreed and suggested we do a Scooby-Doo theme. We could decorate his car to look like the Mystery Machine, and I already have a Daphne costume from when me and my partner dressed up as Daphne and Velma for a Halloween party. So I could dress up as Daphne without worrying about buying a new costume.

He thought it was a great idea, and got super excited about it. 

Here's when things started to get really strange. Although I had mentioned I already had a Daphne costume, he suggested that I dress up as Scooby-Doo instead. I wasn't really wanting to buy a new costume that I wouldn't wear again, so I said no. He began to beg me to dress up as Scooby-Doo. ""It would be perfect"" or ""super funny"" were his arguments and I really didn't get it. So I asked him if it was because he wanted to dress up as Shaggy. Because maybe he wanted to match as Shaggy and Scooby? And he said, no, he would also be dressing up as Scooby-Doo. 

I said that although that was funny, I didn't want to buy a new costume, I've been wanting to save my money for Christmas presents this year. 

So finally he nodded and let it go, and said that I could be Daphne instead of Scooby-Doo.

I thought that was the end of it. But a few days later he sent me a text that said: ""I've changed my mind and would like to dress up as Fred instead of Daphne. You're still going to dress as Scooby-Doo though, right?"" 

I have read this text over and over again, and I still don't understand it. Did Daniel think that I wanted him to dress up as Daphne? So anyways I replied and sent him a text that said: ""No, I already have a Daphne costume, and will not be dressing up as Scooby-Doo. You can be Fred though, but I'm not buying another costume.""

He left me on read. When I saw Daniel again in person, he wouldn't speak to me. And when I asked him what was wrong, he replied that I ""ruined the fun"" and that he ""didn't understand why I couldn't just dress up as Scooby-Doo"" 

He was cold the entire day, and now will not respond to any of my texts.

8,1g56z1k,AITA for asking for my money back for my bestfriend’s hen party after having surgery and being told by the professionals I can’t go?,"My best friends hen is this weekend Friday - Sunday (I am one of the bridesmaids that’s been supporting the maid of honour organising the hen).

I had a hip surgery last Tuesday and my physio has assessed me and told me I can’t go to the hen. I’m gutted I can’t go.

The surgery was booked in a few weeks ago and I had no control over the date and was told it was 50/50 if I could go to the hen and would have to wait to be assessed afterwards.  I told my best friend this before the surgery and she was begging me to try to come regardless and that she would help me as much as I needed, so I kept paying my instalments. 

The hen party was £440 (a lot more than I’d usually be comfortable paying for a hen party!) and I have also just been told I’m being made redundant so I really can’t lose this much money. 

I reached out to the maid of honour (hens sister), that’s just been diagnosed with cancer so going through her own stuff, to ask if I can have at least some of my money back and she said that everything’s been prepaid and it’s too late. 

My bestfriend also told me after my surgery that because she’d now be looking after her sister at the hen she wouldn’t have the capacity to look after me at the hen so would only want me there if I’m 100% better (which I obviously wouldn’t be so close to the surgery - not that I’d want her looking after me at hen her anyway). 

The hen told me that the maid of honours sister in law might come instead to care for the maid of honour during the hen party. Maybe I’m being paranoid but it seems they’re being very vague now about whether she’s coming as I’d asked for her to pay me my contribution if she goes instead.

I have also asked the maid of honour to send me the vendors details and I can supply them with a note from my surgeon to see if I can get some money back for somethings I.e. some food and activities. 

I would still want to cover my share of paying for my bestfriend, but other than that I have also thought about asking the maid of honour if she can ask the others if they would pay a bit more. There’s 14 other girls going (I don’t know any of them) so would be £30 ish pounds extra each, so if not the full amount, at least something. Do you think that’s unreasonable? It just feels a bit unfair me paying for everyone’s food etc. when I’m not there. I helped plan the hen so can say with a decent amount of confidence that this exact hen would have been planned regardless if we started with one less person.

9,1g56t57,AITA for calling my friend a gold digger?,"This is a very 19yo drama but I genuinely don’t know if I’m in the wrong LOL here it goes 

Me (19F) and my friend “Maya” (18F) are both interns at the same company. We were chatting about our love lives with the other interns. For context, I’m seeing a guy “Tomas” (19M) for the first time (only been with women before) and she’s been deciding between two men. 

Maya asked me if Tomas paid for us when we went out, I said that we usually split it but if anyone’s short on money we pay for each other. She said to me that a true man doesn’t let his date pay for anything and that it was obvious that I was going out with a broke dude. I said that I liked being with him and that he treated me well so I don’t really care how much he earns. 

After that, she answered that I wasn’t thinking of the future and that both of her dates showed her their bank accounts and had more than 10k in them.

This is a very 19yo drama but I genuinely don’t know if I’m in the wrong LOL here it goes 

Me (19F) and my friend “Maya” (18F) are both interns at the same company. We were chatting about our love lives with the other interns. For context, I’m seeing a guy “Tomas” (19M) for the first time (only been with women before) and she’s been deciding between two men. 

Maya asked me if Tomas paid for us when we went out, I said that we usually split it but if anyone’s short on money we pay for each other. She said to me that a true man doesn’t let his date pay for anything and that it was obvious that I was going out with a broke dude. I said that I liked being with him and that he treated me well so I don’t really care how much he earns. 

After that, she answered that I wasn’t thinking of the future and that both of her dates showed her their bank accounts and had more than 10k in them.

10,1g56s8c,AITA for making my daughter take a break from going to her best friend’s house because the mom purposely bought her a smaller size dress?,"About two weeks ago my 14 year old daughter Bonnie was out shopping with her best friend Gigi and Gigi’s mom Lauren. While they were out, Lauren bought them both dresses she thought were cute. Except she bought Bonnie a size 3. Bonnie said she picked out one that was her size, but Lauren put it back and said that the size 3 one would be her “aspirational” dress to work towards fitting into.

When she came home, she gave it to me and was upset but also didn't want to say anything bad about Gigi's mom, which I get. First off, Bonnie is a HEALTHY girl. Gymnastics until she was about 11 (and grew several inches), dance in the fall and track in the spring, all her choices. So she's got an athletic build. Gigi is a small girl, barely 5 feet, and so I thought at first she got them mixed up. She told me that Gigi’s mom got it for her to aspire to try to get into by “working hard.”

I said I’d take care of it and get her the right size. The next day, I called Gigi’s mom Lauren and asked her why she would do that. She explained that she thought it would give Bonnie something to work towards, because she heard Bonnie saying she didn’t get asked out last year but Gigi had several boys after her and that it seemed like it upset her.

I told her it was inappropriate and asked her why she would tell a kid she needed to lose weight in order to get attention from boys? She got defensive and said that it was obviously embarrassing for Bonnie to not have boys into her when all her friends do.

She basically said I’m holding Bonnie back from growing up—like I won’t help her with boys, won’t drop hundreds at Sephora, still dress her like a kid, and buy B&BW sprays instead of fancy perfumes. She said it’s messing with Bonnie socially and that she’s the only one in her friend group who hasn’t had a boyfriend. Then she got personal and said just because I’ve “given up” and stopped trying doesn’t mean I have to turn Bonnie into a nun.

FOR THE RECORD, this is partially true. But it's also because Bonnie doesn't WANT that stuff. I have offered to get her more than Cetaphil skincare and she doesn't want it. She got straight As last year and I took her to Ulta for a ""spree"" and sall she wanted was some lip gloss and then ASKED for the body spray instead.

I said that it’s time for a break. The girls can still hang out, but I don’t want Bonnie at Gigi’s house. Bonnie got upset over it and I can deal with that. Gigi’s mom however has gone NUCLEAR over it, spreading poison everywhere she can about me being “psycho” and doubling down on how it’s all because I don’t want my daughter to be happy with a boyfriend when I’m single and “no man would touch me.” Which is just… childish.

I drive there multiple times a week. I get to spend quality time with my nephews, give their parents a small break & I love having family closer. My sister never visits me, but mentions she wants to. My parents used to visit, but now they want to be around the grandchildren, so I'm the only one driving to meet everybody.

Recently, I accidentally took her laptop because we have the same one. I had a big exam the next day and needed my computer with all my notes.

I was cramming and really pissed at myself because I didn't want to spend a hour on the road to get my laptop. I asked maybe she could drive it to me, just this once. But she immediatly started with, should have asked earlier, she didn't get any sleep, shes too busy, i have nothing to do anyway, it's my fault. So I angrily said sry I even asked, just leave it outside, I'll grab it when I get a chance, MAYBE midnight when the traffic dies.

It's starting to feel like I'm always on the road. It feels like all the effort is on me, but she has kids and I don't, so I guess nothing a single person has going on matters.

I decided I didn't want to wait all night & drove to her house leaving around 7:30. At 7:37, she wrote saying maybe she would move the laptop to the car in case it rains. I didnt answer because I was driving there. 

I got there at 8pm. My laptop was on the porch in a  bag. It was dry. I forgot to bring a bag, but it was only 8, so I decided to just msg her and tell her it was on the porch to save time, so she could grab it right away. It wasn't raining. And I was in a rush.

At 8:18, she hadn't read my msg yet, so I wrote again. I wrote twice more while I was studying. Around 10:30, I called and woke her, and told her that her laptop was outside. She hung up on me, &  immediatly started writing me angry messages, how dare I just leave the most expensive thing she owned on the porch like that. She said it was ruined (she could just be saying that to make me feel worse). Then said she hated me, fuck me, I'm a horrible human being and to go to therapy. And then blocked me on messenger.

I felt bad all night thinking her laptop might be ruined. Though I seriously doubt it. Where I put it, it couldn't have gotten wet. I wrote her on another app, and said sorry, honestly I thought it was going to be a quick grab.

The next morning, I had a long email that she wrote in the middle of the night, saying that I'm a AH, her entire life was on that laptop and if I would do something like that, then I could leave her children outside in the cold as well, & she basically doesn't trust me.

I am not an absent father and I see my children extremely regularly.

In total she got in the 'settlement' my house, my car and I got the marital debt to the tone of 25 grand and a drink problem. She didn't leave my pension as it turns out she had been skimming my wages to top her own pension pot (I was very naive with money and she dealt with it) 

I am extremely lucky that I have a stable job that supported me through my issues including a bout of severe depression and hidden alcoholism. I can talk about both now but at the time life was a struggle.
I have, since day one paid above and beyond child support, I regularly get both my children (16 twins) the things they need and the occasional treat (I don't believe in spoiling), they both have phone contracts that I pay for and they both have a small amount set aside for their 18th birthday from me. I have done without things I needed to ensure they were set up. 

I've recently taken a job abroad and my son has decided to live with me, this has led to a re arrangement of our financial agreements and she has torn strips off me basically saying I am starving her (she receives just shy of £400 a month at present) and she can't afford to take my daughter to the airport or pick my son up when he visits. She is trying to get a solicitor and wants to pry more money off me, I have not asked her for any money for flights despite the cost and try to get an airport closest to her to avoid any issues as I have no doubt she will take it out on the kids, not physically but verbally as she has down before.

Prim got all huffy and puffy at me and said that me moving here ruined her life and that the cup I got should be hers. I told her that in life we don’t always get what we want and feel entitled to someone else’s stuff and she needs to learn to not be so entitled. My uncle agreed but my aunt said that I should’ve just let it go because now she’s going to be behaving like a brat at them. I told her that she’s the parent and she shouldn’t be afraid of a 14 year old.

18,1g5536m,AITA For refusing to run errands for my boyfriend,"This seems like such a small petty thing, but it really bugs me and idk if I am in the wrong or he is.

My boyfriend (M25) and I (F23) have been together for about 5 years, and over that time it seems to me that he has been becoming more and more averse to doing things (like anything). All he wants to do is play video games (I am not exaggerating, he has openly expressed that is the only thing he wants to do with his time). This has resulted in me having to take care of a lot of our needs.

The main issue that I am making this post about, though, is that he keeps asking me to run errands for him that he is perfectly capable of doing but just doesn't want to. For example if he wants pizza for dinner, I have to go pick it up by myself, or if I don't want to pick it up I have to make something for us to eat because it's my fault that we don't have pizza. When I have asked why he can't do things himself, he has said that either he just doesn't want to or that it makes him feel loved when I do things for him (which makes me feel like an asshole for not wanting to do it). He also tries to bribe me into doing things by saying he will send me money to buy myself something if I do it, but that just makes me feel like a delivery driver. 

The real kicker happened today. He asked me to go to Walmart to pick up a new gaming controller because he broke his last night when he got angry at his game. I work in an office attached to our apartment, so essentially I work from home and he seems to think that means I can run errands for him during the workday. He said I could just use my lunch break which is only 30 minutes, while the task would take about 40min - 1hr. There is nothing stopping him from going himself after he gets out of work, he just wants to have the controller waiting for him when he gets home so he can game. He has said that he doesn't want to leave the house again after he gets out of work because his job is physically taxing and requires him to drive to the work site (he rides in the truck, he doesn't drive it and it's rarely over an hour commute). We work for the same company and I have done his job before. It's really not that bad, he mostly just waits around and watches videos on his phone. Plus he works shorter hours than I do. 

I don’t feel like it’s right for him to ask me to run errands for him while I am at work, but maybe that is something that a loving partner is supposed to do? I think I have lost all perspective about this because it's such a stupid argument that we have been having repeatedly.  AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA For refusing to run errands for my boyfriend This seems like such a small petty thing, but it really bugs me and idk if I am in the wrong or he is.

","I (30F) have been married to my husband (32M) for five years. We both work hard and are pretty comfortable financially. My husband does earn more than I do, but we’ve always seen it as *our* money — we’re a team and split responsibilities equally.

The issue is my brother-in-law (34M). For years, he’s made these “jokes” about me being a gold digger because my husband earns more. It’s always in front of people, and while I usually just laugh it off to avoid making things awkward, it really bothers me. I’ve always worked, I contribute to our household, and it’s frustrating to have that constantly dismissed like I’m just living off my husband.

Recently, my BIL and his wife asked us to help cover their part of a family vacation because they can’t afford to go on their own. My husband and I talked about it, and while we could help, I really don’t feel comfortable after all the times he’s disrespected me.

When I said no, my BIL tried to laugh it off, saying I was overreacting and that it was all just “harmless jokes.” I’m honestly over it. Now he’s upset, and my in-laws are saying I’m making a big deal out of nothing, and that “family helps family.” My husband has my back, but I can’t help second-guessing myself.

22,1g52wtt,AITA for booking a flight with girlfriend at end of cruise instead of driving back up with her parents?,"My girlfriend and I, her parents, and her brother booked a cruise 9 months ago. Initially I was under the impression we would be flying but her parents insisted to drive. I brought up flying as an alternative but I was shut down. 

Background: Her parents don’t get along very well. They typically fight at home and it’s clear they are not happy with each other. They are married but it is clear that it is not a happy marriage. This affects my girlfriend and her brother.

About 4 days ago, we meet up at her house to take a truck down. After packing, we hit the road. A few hours into it, her mom starts snapping at her dad for little things. Ie: (backseat driving, use blinker, slow down, speed up). Her dad shushes her as he has to concentrate. They bicker back and forth until my girlfriend reminds them to not do this with me in the car. We book a hotel for the night and I really wanted an extra room but it was shut down. 

Their bickering makes me extremely uncomfortable and I really didn’t want to go in this cruise with them because of this. Before heading to the cruise, there were more bickering. It was a constant battle between them and it was really upsetting my girlfriend and her brother. I couldn’t take it anymore.

While on the cruise, my girlfriend and I book a flight to fly back home. After telling her mom and dad, her mom was more surprised that her daughter was going than I am and brushed it off. She was more dismissive of the reason we gave her, because we didn’t want to deal with their bickering on the drive back.

I think I might be the asshole because of my reasoning but I need to know if what I did was justified.

Two people are asking me for a pen, I did not want to give them because they creeped me out…So I simply told them I don’t have one, but I have a backpack so it was obvious I had one. One of them asked me what we use in school nowadays and I told them that we’re using computers…afterward I « hugged » my backpack so they wouldn’t steal my computer (I have a MacBook) and then they started being REALLY MAD.

They started yelling at me by saying « do you think I will steal from you ? Nowadays people don’t even laugh, look at the guy in front of you, he laugh. » he kept continuing my calling me « you’re a son of a bitch, you’re an asshole » he kept repeating it like 3 times. He said « I’m sure you’re from Shanghai, where are you from ? » he might have thought I was Asian and im not even Asian….he said « don’t look at me in the eyes, look at my paycheck right here, I earn more than your parents (he’s showing me right in front of my face the paycheck) ».

He did other things that I don’t remember but overall he kept yelling at me and insulting me. At the end, he wanted to fight me. He was READY to do it but they got out and his friend kept him from going further. Afterwards I felt totally worthless with what happened…especially the fact that the one guy in front of me just kept watching, I don’t expect him to react but he clearly seemed to not care from what was happening. 

Now my parents are mad, because I told them that I had a computer and they were feared they would be stealing me. They did not even care for my life it seems, so I’m mad at them because clearly this man was ready to fight me, and they only care about this computer and not the life of their son ?

Now I want to know if my anger is justified toward my parents for not giving a f*ck and if the fact that I lied about not having a pen to the guys justified all of what they said. 

Sorry for my English it’s not my first language, I also want to highlight that I’m 18 and the guys seemed to be in their 50s.

25,1g526f1,AITA for letting my daughter out of the car at a stop sign?,"My daughter's middle school starts at 7:30, when it's still dark outside. As winter progresses, it’s getting even darker in the morning, so today I gave her a ride. Going through the drop-off area can take 15-20 minutes just to get through the traffic, so she asked if I could drop her off at the four-way intersection in front of her school. This is a residential neighborhood, so only local traffic passes through the intersection.

A few blocks away, a school bus pulled in behind me. As we approached the stop where I planned to let my daughter out, I sped up a bit to increase the gap between the bus and our car—now about a block behind us. We pulled up to the stop sign, and my daughter quickly jumped out onto the sidewalk. This took about 2-3 seconds.

As the school bus pulled up, the driver blared the horn for about 3-4 seconds, scaring both my daughter and me. I was confused for a moment, thinking I might have caused an accident, but then I realized it was just the bus driver being... whatever they were.

To top it off, as I was making a turn and waiting for a girl to cross the street, the bus driver gave me another blast of the horn. This time, I was pissed and flipped them off while waiting for the girl to cross.

I know it can be a potential safety hazard to let someone out at a stop sign, but we were completely stopped, and no one was behind us for about 2 seconds. I probably delayed the bus by just 1 second more than if I had driven through. I’m still mad at the aggressiveness of the bus driver but am wondering if I might have been in the wrong.

EDIT: While I couldn’t find any laws against dropping someone off at a stop sign—especially since the delay was no more than a second and I was waiting for someone to cross the street—I’m not proud of flipping off the bus driver.

I know it can be a potential safety hazard to let someone out at a stop sign, but we were completely stopped, and no one was behind us for about 2 seconds. I probably delayed the bus by just 1 second more than if I had driven through. I’m still mad at the aggressiveness of the bus driver but am wondering if I might have been in the wrong.

EDIT: While I couldn’t find any laws against dropping someone off at a stop sign—especially since the delay was no more than a second and I was waiting for someone to cross the street—I’m not proud of flipping off the bus driver. Still, the aggressive behavior of the driver seemed unwarranted and particularly self-righteous.",2.0,0.9942065,1,0

I made the decision after working out some technical stuff that I can't afford to have the TV blasting loud in the background of my videos due to the risk of Copyright. Especially when I have no way to soundproof my room due to being in an apartment. So today on my break I decided to turn on the parental controls for my Now for access she has to ask me permission or go use her own in her room.

So I need to know am I the Asshole for parental locking my roommates, my Mother specifically from accessing my Roku so I can Record Content for my YT Channel in Peace without having to risk Copyright on my content. Without her being informed until she tries to use it upon her return home.

House of roomies = 5 people including Trevor and new girlfriend. 


Story: Sarah's cat remained in the house of roomies after she broke up with Trevor as they all feared a move would be too stressful for the cat. Trevor has since started dating a new person and the topic made Sarah uncomfortable so they stopped speaking about it. The cat's health declined and Sarah was invited over to say goodbye. 

Trevor's new girlfriend lives with them now but Sarah did not know this. None of 5 people in the house informed her about the move or that she would be present. So she went over expecting the usual 4 people to be there and to say goodbye to her cat, and was greeted by Trevor's new girlfriend. 

I them this was wrong, rude, and out of line considering they knew Sarah was already uncomfortable and this was such a sensitive and awful time for her (losing the cat). That a quick text letting her know gave her the autonomy to decide and change plans where needed, when spontaneously surprising her with new gf at the door did not allow for that.

They disagreed and said it was nice of them to invite her to say goodbye to the cat. That they were being kind by arranging the visit despite some tense moments during conversations about the cat. And that she was unstable and might have been upset to learn new girlfriend was living there prior to showing up. Communication between them could be tense at times. 

A couple things as a notion of clarity is that Sarah is a high functioning autistic person with some mental health struggles. Additionally, it has been a pain point in my past with the house that I feel they regularly do not let people know when unexpected +1s will be around in group dynamics and established plans. They said I was just hypersensitive.

Last month I was practically forced to pay the light bill because my mom got fired from her job and was basically blacklisted from working in the same field and couldn't find work for a month. She relapsed and began drinking daily and told me I was the reason for her relapse.

The week or so before the bill needed to be paid the last thing I heard when I'd walk out the door to go to work and the first thing I'd hear coming back was that I needed to pay the bill. It was exhausting. She never even asked about my financial situation or if I could even do it in the first place, she just demanded that I do it because she was my mother.

I was never asked to pay rent or bills before because my mom didnt want me to have any ""power"" over what happens in the apartment. This was another reason I paid the bill last month, since it seemed like she really had no other option if she was willing to release that control.

My mom was not appreciative. She didn't see that it was hard to pay the bill and left me with 11 dollars in my account, she only saw that I did it because I needed to do it for her, that it was owed to her as her right as my mother. She even got upset and said that I knew I was going to pay the bill anyway and purposely let her stress out.

My mother continues to yell every single day and tell me that she wishes she didn't have to live with me, and that once I move out she doesn't even want to see me on her deathbed. She now has a new job and continues to drink. She frequently stands outside my door to get a quick jab in and constantly sends me text messages insulting me but I try not to look at them. She says I don't have a real job and probably doesn't believe I'm actually in college, she never asks about any of the assignments I'm working on and getting her to fill out the fafsa is a battle every single year.

I tried to explain to him that giving them money and buying them nice things is only one part of taking care of them. I've tried so hard to explain that you need to interact with them more or they would see you as a piggy bank and not a dad who they could talk to. 

This all came to a head when I was taking the kids out to eat, but he didn't want to go. I told him he hasn't spent time with them since they were babies. This lead to a argument and we both got mad.

This all came to a head when I was taking the kids out to eat, but he didn't want to go. I told him he hasn't spent time with them since they were babies. This lead to a argument and we both got mad. It ended when I told him he's not acting any different than his own dad. I've never seen him look and sound angrier in my life. That was all yesterday. 

AITA for telling him he's no better than his own dad?

35,1g50sxk,AITA for making a scrapbook for my stepson's 18th birthday?,"Hi, i'm using my friends account because i don't want to make a whole account, since i don't use reddit myself.

so for some background.

I (35f) met my husband (roy) (38m) have been married for 2 years. he has a son (18m) who we call ""max"" from a previous girlfriend. She had max young. condom broke and she sadly passed away by childbirth. Max only knows about his mom because of the stories his dad had told him. He always had help from his mom growing up while being a single dad. Me and max have a good relationship. he knows i am not trying to replace his mom. He calls me mom and the first time, it was emotional for the three of us. I really do see him as my own, but i do not force anything on him. MIL (65f) and i have a good relationship. I can't say the same as the relationship with roy's previous gf. She never liked her and that she made roy a father at a young age.

Now to the issue:

Max's 18th birthday was yesterday. We all had a great time and max had a blast with his friends and family. He wanted a bbq party (he LOVES bbq). A few months ago i was thinking of making a scrapbook about his mom and her past. I talked to roy about this and he loved the idea. So we went to work. We contacted her parents and they loved the idea. We got copies of all the pictures we wanted. We also wrote down some stories about her. It looked amazing imo.

So yesterday was his birthday and after all the presents we gave ours (we also had other presents). He absolutely loved it. He looked so happy with it!! I saw my mil's face and i knew she hated it.

After the party she came to me while i was putting leftovers in the frigde and asked me what that was all about. I just told her that we wanted to give him something special about his mom and have photos and memories about her that he can always look at. She started freaking out telling me that she was no real parent and that she was a babytrapping my husband (which did not happen, there was shock but they eventually wanted the baby). I was done with her hate for this woman and told her to leave.

Now she is texting all my husbands family that what i did was wrong. I don't know how i did anyhting wrong????????? Max loved the gift!

36,1g50myc,AITA for asking to go to Michigan on my 18th birthday ,"I 17f am preparing for my first ultra (26.2+) my friend jackson 19f was supposed to come to missouri from ohio to run it with me. (Note: I moved to Missouri right after my high school graduation at 16 since I am an early graduate) However, he got an ankle injury during training. He texted me if there were any more races in January or February so he could come up and race it with me.  I told him no however there is one in Michigan on my 18th birthday I want to do.
I also joked he should bring Matt M19 as we were trying to get him to come up for the ultra but he couldn’t. He asked matt to come and he said yes. (Note: we were on a sports “team” for JROTC in high school) So I had to ask my aunt who I live with and then she said “no, we will talk about it” I figured that would be the answer, so I did some more research. I asked my foster mom F64 who is from Michigan where the best and safest place to stay and then she said downtown and said she would come with us. So now there’s a real adult coming not just a bunch of people who just got out of high school in 2024. 
I told my aunt this and shes now saying “we will talk about this in June” and that she thinks I’m immature for researching the trip and trying to find ways to go. Which seems backwards logic to me. I am trying to put together an itinerary but that depends on how we get there since I could drive to ohio and then we take my car or I could fly to ohio and then we take matts car. Which is a whole separate issue. 
Since my Aunt thinks I am to inexperienced to drive down even though I would have my license for almost a year at that point. My sister drove from ohio to Missouri with just 3 months experience and she was 19. I also don’t have any car accidents or tickets.  if I fly down and we take matts car he has 4 years experience with no accidents or tickets.

37,1g50lzo,AITA for moving in with my paternal grandparents despite my mom's strong protest?,"I (18f) moved in with my paternal grandparents three weeks ago. Context; I turned 18 three weeks ago. My mom did not want me to live with them and she strongly opposed it for the two months she had known I wanted to. I didn't actually tell her. She heard me talking to my brother (16) about it.

My mom hates my paternal grandparents and she hates that my brother and I love them and still talk to them. Things got bad several years ago.

So my parents were married, had me and my brother, dad died when we were 7 and 5.  Mom and grandparents fought because of funeral arrangements. Mom wanted to go against dad's written wishes while my grandparents wanted to support them. They had a strained relationship after that and my grandparents had to sue for grandparents rights to see me and my brother.

When I was 10 mom remarried. Her husband has three kids. His older two are from his first marriage, his youngest is from a different relationship. Mom adopted his youngest because her mom was not in her life. The youngest has a lot of health and medical issues. She's diabetic, has asthma, has some stomach and digestive issue and she has a heart defect. My mom and her husband struggled to pay for some of the medications and the cheaper alternatives weren't working for her. They tried to cut all the corners they could and he got a second job to pay more but the price of some of her meds went really high. My mom asked my grandparents for help paying for them. She was freaked out at the time because the youngest was getting sick a lot and the doctor was concerned she was getting worse. So mom wanted my grandparents to alleviate the stress and help pay for some of the meds since they could afford it and they spoiled me and my brother. My grandparents said no. Mom pleaded with them and suggested she would work on paying them back some day if they were really unwilling to help but that it was something that could cost a child her life. My grandparents still refused. Mom was furious. About two years after that they had managed to get on top of things and mom tried to end grandparents rights in court but lost. She never forgave my grandparents and she has expressed a lot of bitterness and hate toward them ever since and has discouraged me and my brother from loving them. She told us we should hate that they would do that to our family.

None of this hurt mine and my brother's relationship with our grandparents. I don't feel any anger or hard feelings toward them for the decision. I still love them. I think mom was really unfair to the two of us when she was spewing all that anger about them. I didn't want to be around it more and wanted to spend more time with my grandparents so we talked and agreed I could move in when I was 18 and I did. But my mom is furious, her husband said I am never allowed in their house again. Mom told me I have betrayed my family for people who could happily be evil to a child.

38,1g509sl,"AITA for Calling the City Inspector on My Neighbor’s Sketchy Deck?

","I (28F) live in a small, close-knit neighborhood where everyone’s pretty friendly. We do the whole wave-at-each-other thing, and sometimes even chat over the fence. It’s peaceful, which is one of the reasons I love it here.

Anyway, my next-door neighbor, Tom (mid-40s), decided a few months ago that he wanted to build a deck in his backyard. Cool, right? At first, I thought it was a great idea. He seemed excited about it, always talking about how he was going to host barbecues once it was done.

But then, the construction started… and things got messy, literally and figuratively. Tom and his buddies would be out there late into the night, hammering, sawing, and making a ton of noise, even past 10 p.m. It wasn’t just the noise, though. I’m no expert, but from the looks of it, this deck was wobbly. I mean, you could see the slant from my yard, and I started imagining it collapsing during one of his parties. I didn’t want to be dramatic, but it genuinely looked unsafe.

One weekend, I tried to bring it up in the most casual way possible. While we were both outside, I said something like, “That’s coming along fast! Have you double-checked the measurements? It looks a bit off.” Tom just laughed it off like I was being overly cautious, saying, “Nah, it’s fine! I’ve built things before. Don’t worry about it.”

So, I left it at that… for a while.

But the deck construction kept going, and it was loud. And lopsided. And the more I thought about it, the more anxious I became. What if someone actually got hurt? What if a kid was on that deck when it gave out? I didn’t want to be the nosy neighbor, but I also couldn’t shake the bad feeling.

Finally, after another sleepless night of construction noise, I made the decision to anonymously call the city inspector. I figured, if everything was fine, then nothing would come of it. No harm done, right?

Well, the inspector showed up a few days later. Tom wasn’t home when they did the inspection, but when he got back, he was furious. Turns out, he didn’t have the right permits, and they flagged a bunch of safety issues. Now he has to make a ton of changes before he can finish it, and the project is basically on hold.

Tom’s been complaining to anyone who’ll listen, calling me (though not directly to my face) a “nosy neighbor.” He thinks it was totally unnecessary, and that I should’ve just minded my own business. I’ve heard him venting to other neighbors, and now I feel awkward anytime I’m outside. A couple of my other neighbors said I overreacted and should’ve trusted Tom to handle it.

So now I’m feeling conflicted. I didn’t mean to stir up drama, but I also didn’t want to ignore something that felt unsafe.

42,1g4zfxu,AITA for telling my brother's fiancée to grow up and stop trying to put her anger and trauma on me?,"My brother ""Matt"" (30m) is engaged to ""Evelyn"" (32f). Matt is our parents bio son. I'm (25f) their adopted daughter. We have another sister who is a bio and two more brothers who are adopted. Our parents fostered many kids and adopted some of us. I always knew I was adopted. I was removed from an unsafe environment and didn't have any safe bio relatives. My bio ""family"" is tiny in terms of known and none of them are good people.

I'm glad I was adopted. I feel so lucky to have found a family who embraced the fact we were not biologically connected but loved us the same and didn't try to make it shameful. Those of us who were adopted have our own circumstances for being so. One of my brother's was orphaned and his biological parents wanted a family who would love and take care of him and he got that with us. 

Matt's fiancée Evelyn was adopted as an infant and she has a lot of feelings about that. I understand why she has some complicated feelings regarding being adopted, and why she feels like her parents bought a child because they wanted one vs wanting to give a child a good life. Her adoptive parents wanted to erase her bio side and shamed her for ever having an interest in it and they talked badly about her birth family her whole life.  I don't think that was right or okay.

But Evelyn is obsessed with making every adoptee feel the same way she does.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA for telling my brother's fiancée to grow up and stop trying to put her anger and trauma on me? My brother ""Matt"" (30m) is engaged to ""Evelyn"" (32f). Matt is our parents bio son. I'm (25f) their adopted daughter. We have another sister who is a bio and two more brothers who are adopted. Our parents fostered many kids and adopted some of us. I always knew I was adopted. I was removed from an unsafe environment and didn't have any safe bio relatives. My bio ""family"" is tiny in terms of known and none of them are good people.

I'm glad I was adopted. I feel so lucky to have found a family who embraced the fact we were not biologically connected but loved us the same and didn't try to make it shameful. Those of us who were adopted have our own circumstances for being so. One of my brother's was orphaned and his biological parents wanted a family who would love and take care of him and he got that with us. 

Matt's fiancée Evelyn was adopted as an infant and she has a lot of feelings about that. I understand why she has some complicated feelings regarding being adopted, and why she feels like her parents bought a child because they wanted one vs wanting to give a child a good life. Her adoptive parents wanted to erase her bio side and shamed her for ever having an interest in it and they talked badly about her birth family her whole life.  I don't think that was right or okay.

But Evelyn is obsessed with making every adoptee feel the same way she does. She has spoken negatively about my parents ""robbing"" three kids of their rights to have legal access to their biological family history and identity. She has suggested I was brainwashed by CPS into believing I was removed for safety reasons from my birth family and had no safe birth relatives (spoiler alert, all my known birth relatives have all been to prison multiple times and yes I looked them up).

We each have a daughter from previous relationships ages 5 and 7.  I make good money at my day job, I rent 4 apartments and one house out, do all my own repairs, and sometimes door dash for extra.  She has been a waitress working for tips and just started at the school as a para and doesn’t make much.  We bought a house in April but when we went to the bank the lender recommended we put the loan in her name and get an FHA loan for better rates.  I had two mortgages already at the time, one on a fourplex which I rent out and one on the home I was living in which I now rent out.  The bank dropped the ball and forgot to add me to the deed but said I could add it after the loan was issued.  This house was a foreclosure home and before we even moved in we had to fix a bunch of plumbing, hire an electrician to bring electric to code and install a new meter socket, hire HVAC to install AC, bring in appliances as there were none, and install a new water heater.  I paid the electrician, I paid the HVAC bill, I bought appliances, I paid for inspections.  We split the down payment which was only 1500 or so each.  Since we closed I’ve paid every house payment and dumped all of my extra savings into fixing this house.  
 
Since we moved in together she has been increasingly controlling.  She yells at me if I go to her sisters and talk to her boyfriend for too long without her, she gets mad when female tenants talk to me, she gets irritated if I talk about woman I encounter at work if she knows them, she gets mad when I try to be a good co-parent with my ex for my kids sake, she gets mad about a woman I’ve been friends with since kindergarten.  My kids mom doesn’t get out of her car when she drops my daughter off, still GF gets mad at the sight of her.  Meanwhile her child’s dad will stop and come to the door just to talk to his daughter on nights she’s at our house, he sits with us at parades, he’s shown up to gatherings of ours, he even followed her to my aunts house last Halloween and followed her inside the house like he lived there.  The other day we got into an argument and she brought up a woman friend of mine.  I’m not friends with a lot of women but one I do talk to regularly.  I’ve been up front with GF that I talk to a woman friend since day 1.  It’s caused problems with a couple of relationships and it’s always been my opinion that if you think you need to change me to be happy then we shouldn’t be together.  We have not hung out for more than a couple minutes since GF and I got together, I’m still friends with my friends ex husband and he never cared.  GF even bought her a birthday present and told her to stop by and get it before we moved in together.  

This has all become very overbearing.  I like to work on cars and listen to music after kids go to bed, sometimes until midnight and if I do that now it’s a problem.   I’ve decided on pursuing a career in real estate sales and it’s important to have lots of relationships with lots of people I’m fighting hard to become a better person and obtain a career that allows me freedom to always be there for my kid.

44,1g4zaz9,AITA for not moving states for my husbands new job,"
I’m a 28-year-old mom of four, married for 7 years. My husband, 26, has always struggled with planning, leaving me to make most decisions. A year after our wedding, he joined the military, leaving me with our 3-year-old and 2-month-old. I had to move us out of our apartment on my own. After his boot camp, we made frequent trips from KY to Illinois just to be with him, staying in hotels and Airbnbs. Despite the strain, I tried to make it work, but it became too much.

Four years later, he chose to leave the military without a backup plan, despite my worries. I didn’t want to leave the military in the same place we entered—broke, in debt, and with no clear path forward—but he left anyway. We went through 8 long months of him being unable to find work, and I had to take on 80-hour weeks at my online job to keep us afloat. At this point, we had four children and were living in his mom’s small 2-bedroom apartment. Eventually, we were fortunate enough to find a rental, even with his eviction record, and finally found some stability.

My husband now has a great job making 120K, but it’s in Ohio, 2.5 hours away. He commutes daily, sleeping in his SUV when needed. He wants us to move with him, but I’m afraid of losing the peace we’ve worked so hard to build. For 7 years, I’ve been the primary parent, handling everything while working from home and homeschooling. Now, with the kids in school, I’m able to breathe again—I’ve even started a medical assistant course and am working toward my BA online. For the first time, I’m taking care of myself, working out with a trainer, and trying to lose the weight I’ve carried for years.

Our financial situation is still fragile; we have debt, poor credit, and no savings as we’re catching up on bills. I fear moving will disrupt our stability and force me back into homeschooling all four children, leaving me alone to carry the load once more. I know my husband’s commute is hard, and I appreciate his sacrifice, but moving again feels like a risk that would cost us the progress I’ve fought for. His job is unpredictable—it could change states again—and I just want some sense of security. 

I take care of everything outside his job: the kids, the finances, the home. I finally feel like I’m in a place where I can breathe, and I’m scared of losing that. Am I wrong for wanting to stay where I feel we are finally okay?

48,1g4ypte,WIBTA if I don't give my friend the money I promised him?,"My (23f) online friend (21m), let's call him Mika, lives in Russia. Things have been getting worse for him and he works a job that pays for rent and food, but nothing more. He eventually wants to leave the country but needs the funds for the first steps.

Now, his Russian bank account can't receive money from most foreign countries, including mine in the EU. He said he'll have to travel to Belarus in person to open a bank account there but cannot currently afford the journey. Despite only knowing him for 1 month at the time, I offered to cover the travel expenses, which would come to 150€ - I said I'd give him 200€, no strings attached - and inquired about possible ways to send said money. Mika told me he would look into it. This was in July. 

August 2024: After not hearing from him for a while outside of our shared Discord server, I pmd him with several ideas I had, all of which wouldn't work according to him. 
Money in the mail - It'd likely get stolen or ""lost"" at border inspection. Bank account transfer is not possible. Paypal and Paysafe are banned. I suggested he do an art commission for me in which I want a stick figure drawing for 200€, but he thinks such a large payment would get flagged. I then said I could subscribe to an empty Patreon and give him partial amounts over a few months - but Patreon, Ko-fi, prepaid credit cards, nothing is secure enough or available to us both. Finally I figured if he took up a credit in Russia to finance the trip I would send the money to his Belarusian account as soon as it was opened. He thanked me for my help and yet again said he'd look into it. 

September 2024: My situation has changed and I am now unemployed. While I am financially stable, 200€ suddenly is a lot more than it was before. 

It's October 16th now. Mika got some extra money from his grandmother a few weeks ago and decided to buy a new computer screen. I'm now questioning how urgent his situation even is, since he never followed up after our last convo 3 months ago. When I made my promise, initially, I intended to keep my word, but now I'm not sure anymore and slightly pissed off on top of it. If he were to message me today, I would still send the 200€, but given his recent behaviour I'm getting the feeling that's not gonna happen anytime soon. 

WIBTA if I withdraw my offer? 

EDIT: To the people saying he's a scammer - I know that he is not, and I will not engage with your comments. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"WIBTA if I don't give my friend the money I promised him? My (23f) online friend (21m), let's call him Mika, lives in Russia. Things have been getting worse for him and he works a job that pays for rent and food, but nothing more. He eventually wants to leave the country but needs the funds for the first steps.

Now, his Russian bank account can't receive money from most foreign countries, including mine in the EU. He said he'll have to travel to Belarus in person to open a bank account there but cannot currently afford the journey. Despite only knowing him for 1 month at the time, I offered to cover the travel expenses, which would come to 150€ - I said I'd give him 200€, no strings attached - and inquired about possible ways to send said money. Mika told me he would look into it. This was in July. 

August 2024: After not hearing from him for a while outside of our shared Discord server, I pmd him with several ideas I had, all of which wouldn't work according to him. 
Money in the mail - It'd likely get stolen or ""lost"" at border inspection. Bank account transfer is not possible. Paypal and Paysafe are banned. I suggested he do an art commission for me in which I want a stick figure drawing for 200€, but he thinks such a large payment would get flagged. I then said I could subscribe to an empty Patreon and give him partial amounts over a few months - but Patreon, Ko-fi, prepaid credit cards, nothing is secure enough or available to us both. Finally I figured if he took up a credit in Russia to finance the trip I would send the money to his Belarusian account as soon as it was opened. He thanked me for my help and yet again said he'd look into it. 

September 2024: My situation has changed and I am now unemployed. While I am financially stable, 200€ suddenly is a lot more than it was before.

49,1g4ynt2,AITA for not calling my dad's new wife my parent?,"My dad got (re)married 6 months ago to Claire. They were dating for 3 years and I knew her for about a year before they got married. So I (16m) was 15 when they met. My older brother (21) and sister (19) were both older and out of the house so met her later.

Our mom died years ago. Dad's the only parent I remember having.

I go to a computer class after school on Thursday and Fridays. Last Thursday Claire came to pick me up which was unexpected. I normally walk home. Apparently she wanted to spend some time with me and bond. She came into the computer room I was in and she heard the organizer ask if a letter home should be addressed to parent/parents or guardian/guardians and I said parent.

When Claire was driving me home she brought it up and asked why I said parent instead of parents. I told her because dad's my only parent.

Saturday dad and Claire asked me to sit and talk with them and they asked what I say Claire is. I told them I say she's my dad's wife. They asked me if I'd call them together ""my parents"" and I said no. I told them I only say parent for dad. I'd say dad and his wife or dad and Claire.

Claire told me she'd like me to be open to the idea that she could be another parent for me. I told them I didn't want Claire to be my parent and I'd prefer her to stay as dad's wife. She said she missed out on being a parent to my siblings but I was still a minor and we could try. I wasn't open to it. Dad asked if I would think about saying parents sometimes. He said I don't have to but it would be nice. Claire said she really wants me to open up to that idea. I said I just don't see her as that and it's not a place I want her to have in my life.

She's not happy with me. She thinks I'm being cold. Dad told me afterward that my siblings don't answer many of her calls which is making her sensitive.

52,1g4y9u6,AITA for not dropping out of an event to babysit my cousin even though my real family needed me?,"first time posting on here because im kind of losing my mind and i need unbiased opinions.

so basically this all started last week i (16 f) was supposed to be part of my cousin (32f) (on my mothers side) ""jamie""'s wedding, this was planned out almost a year in advance and i had agreed since january 2024 that i would be there to help with and participate in the wedding.

anyways the main thing that happened is that 2 days before the wedding, my grandmother (on my dads side) decided that she wanted to spend more time with her grandkids (me and ""jullian"": the cousin i was expected to babysit), and told me to drop the wedding and go to an arcade with her and jullian instead. i refused for 3 reasons, the first being that, the last time i went out with both of them, jullian decided to run into a air hockey table while people were playing and accidentally got elbowed by the guy playing, then he threw a fit, bit the guy and ran off screaming. (i was blamed for this incident because apparently i wasnt paying enough attention).

the second reason is that my grandma is the type of grandparent that loves playing with their grandkids but never takes care of them properly and just lets them run off/bribes them with candy to not tell their parents about her strange behavior.

the third is that i promised jamie that i would be there at her wedding to celebrate with her.

obviously when i didnt agree to go out with my grandma she got upset, which only pissed her off more when i said i couldnt go because of the wedding. her reasoning was that jullian is my only real cousin (hes my dads sisters kid) and the only one who should actually be close to me, when all of my cousins on my moms side are fake (they're like second/third/second once removed typa thing so like my moms cousins kids). but i got really mad when she said this because even if they arent my closest relatives they basically raised me when i was a kid? i will admit i probably went overboard when i yelled that they were more my family than she could ever be, but i was really pissed that she thought she could decide for me who was more important in my own family

everything went to shit because she went to my whole family complaining that i was disrespectful and unfillial and that i didnt care about my family- which wtf???? and saying that i should choose ""my own blood"" over ""distant strangers"" and that jamie had enough people helping her anyways (moms family is pretty big -about 40 people when everyone comes together) and didnt need me so i should have just done what she'd told me to.

Getting together, eating, drinking, talking. A setting I absolutely love. So I asked who she wanted to invite. Some of ther friends I already know some I would meet on this party for the first time.

Among the friends I don't yet know are two guys. One she had a breif thing with liek a friends plus thing. Another one she had a short relatiosnhip with (less than 6 months). I know she is still in touch with both of them even though she rarely sees them. They text through instagram occasionally but meet maybe once or twice a year.

The relationship they have is purely friendly from her side. From what she told me, both guys made advancements in the past year to see if she would be open to friends plus. Which she denied and made clear she is with me and has no interest whatsover to go into that dicretion. Even if we would not be with me, she wants to maintain the friendship they have.

  
I have no issue with her being friends with them. I know how she is. I know I can trust her. Trust or jealousy is not the issue.

I never liked meeting an ex of my current partner. They could be best buddy material. I am simply not interested. I do not like it. It's nothing to do with them personally. This is me not liking to spend time with people that used to date, kiss, fuck & did what have you my current partner.

So I told her I am happy to help her set everything up, help with organization and everything. But as long as these two people are attending, I will not.

56,1g4wcgs,AITA for eating my roommate's burrito?,"Last night, my roommate and a couple of his friends went to Qdoba and got some burritos. When we stopped to eat them, his friend who is driving passed out the burritos. We didn't realize at the time, but my roommate got mine and I got his. My roommate took a couple huge bites and then realized it was the wrong burrito. He realized I got his and wanted to switch. He already ate like a quarter of my burrito so I said I would just eat his. He got upset and said he wanted his burrito and he paid for extra meat. I didn't want to eat the burrito he already ate part of so I told him tough luck and ate his.

 He didn't even eat the rest of my burrito, just sat there pouting while everyone was eating until his friend drove him back to Qdoba to get another burrito. When we got back home, he handed me the receipt and tried to make me pay for it? I laughed and said he should replace my burrito since I didn't get what I wanted either since I did not want a chicken burrito but didn't throw a fit about it. He started yelling that it's disrespectful to eat somebody else's food right in front of them. I told him that's exactly what he did but he says it's an accident so it doesn't count. I offered to pay the difference since his was a bit extra for extra toppings but he looked offended by me offering two dollars. He was yelling that he had to pay double price because I ate his burrito even though he could have ate mine. I told him he was acting like a toddler and it was a mistake but that made it worse and he got pissed and left and slammed the door.

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA for eating my roommate's burrito? Last night, my roommate and a couple of his friends went to Qdoba and got some burritos. When we stopped to eat them, his friend who is driving passed out the burritos. We didn't realize at the time, but my roommate got mine and I got his. My roommate took a couple huge bites and then realized it was the wrong burrito. He realized I got his and wanted to switch. He already ate like a quarter of my burrito so I said I would just eat his. He got upset and said he wanted his burrito and he paid for extra meat. I didn't want to eat the burrito he already ate part of so I told him tough luck and ate his.

 He didn't even eat the rest of my burrito, just sat there pouting while everyone was eating until his friend drove him back to Qdoba to get another burrito. When we got back home, he handed me the receipt and tried to make me pay for it? I laughed and said he should replace my burrito since I didn't get what I wanted either since I did not want a chicken burrito but didn't throw a fit about it. He started yelling that it's disrespectful to eat somebody else's food right in front of them. I told him that's exactly what he did but he says it's an accident so it doesn't count. I offered to pay the difference since his was a bit extra for extra toppings but he looked offended by me offering two dollars. He was yelling that he had to pay double price because I ate his burrito even though he could have ate mine. I told him he was acting like a toddler and it was a mistake but that made it worse and he got pissed and left and slammed the door.

57,1g4w8mm,AITA? My (29F) fiancé (28F) thinks I don't like him talking to his mom because I said something when he wouldn't leave the room or pause the movie. ,"He is foreign, his mom is in his home country. They talk for hours. I understand because i love my mom too but I  do get alittle jealous because regardless if were having a deep convo or in the middle of some kind of quality time, when she calls its basically f*** what I'm saying or what we are doing. So I've made a point not to talk about much or do anything with him  until after she calls. 

But last night we were watching a movie that I really wanted to see and she called.  He apparently felt that he didn't need to leave the room or pause the movie while he talked loudly with her  through the whole 2+hour movie. I gave him looks and didn't think I needed to say anything as I wasnt trying to be rude, since it would be common sense to go outside, pause the movie, or go in the other room until he was done. Hes gotten the hint before and went to another room but last night no. & Anytime I'm on the phone I go in the other room.  

So, when I mentioned it after the movie he blew up like I had a problem with him talking to his mom and even when I tried to explain it was just the principle and lack common sense/courtesy. He said it's not my business and if he wants to talk to her until he falls asleep he will. I had to reinerate I don't care if he talks to her or for how long---just go in the other room or pause the movie.  So we go our separate ways he mumbles bs under his breathe and speaks when I've left the room to go to bed. 

We haven't talked or had contact so much as eye since last night, slept on completely opposite sides of the bed not even a toe touching and he didn't even kiss me goodbye for work. I know he probably thinks I'm wrong and I'm the problem and he did nothing wrong so.  


TLDR; fiancé thinks I have a problem with him talking to his mom and now we aren't talking even after I tried to explain that he should had just paused the movie or left the room like normal.

60,1g4vr9i,AITAH for getting mad  at my husband for what he does in his sleep? ,"Edit: I may have cast my husband in a worse light than intended. He does do stuff for me, and is generally very caring (he’ll make me food and stuff like that). The head rubs and the sleep are the two BIG ticket items for me, tho. Also, we currently don’t have a spare room, but we will be moving into a house in November, and a spare bed may make the list of items we buy for it if we have the extra cash. 

We have three cats that my husband adores. He would do anything for these cats. We often joke about how it’s always good cop bad cop between us because he feeds into their bad behavior (like letting them eat off his plate) and I don’t. 

For context (this is going to sounds like I’m patting myself on the back) but I’m really low maintenance. He often even comments about how lucky he is that I’m this way. Most things in our marriage are actually pretty easy, as well. 

There are very few things I ask for, but two things that I need desperately are my sleep, and for him to rub my head from time to time. Whenever I ask him to rub my head, he complains and says he’s too tired. But 2 seconds later, a cat walks in and he’s literally up out of bed petting them and rubbing them and I’m like 😑

The thing that really kills me is at night, one of the cats will lay at his feet and rather than move the cat, he will move to my side of the bed until I’m practically falling out. This also invariably leads to me having an inch of covers, as well. I’ve tried waking him up to ask him to move and he always says “I don’t want to disturb the cat.” 

Last night, after a particularly long day at work, I asked if he would rub my head and he gave me the whole song and dance only to get up and pet one of the cats. Then, I spend the whole night getting woken up every hour dealing with feet and fists in my back from him trying not to disturb the cat. The alarm goes off and, even though I’m still sleeping, he gets up and starts singing jingles to the cats. I told him I was still sleeping and he said, “but you’re up now.” 

He doesn’t understand how I feel like he would rather inconvenience me, his wife, than our cats. And his excuse is that he’s asleep. AITAH?

My half sister was diagnosed with a rare condition when she was 2. It was always clear something was wrong but they had a really hard time figuring out what it was. Doctors would say she'd be fine when she was older. This condition isn't life threatening, like she won't die from it, but it could potentially leave her permanently disabled in a bad way. A few months ago they found out about this hard to get into treatment for it. But it was expensive. There was/is ways to get help paying for it but that takes longer. So my dad decided he would use the inheritance mom left me to pay for it. He tried asking me but he was going to do it anyway and when I said no he told me as much. Then he shamed me for saying no, for putting college before the health of my half sister. Louise was in the room with us but she wasn't talking before I said no.

I told him I hated him and I told Louise she better never speak to me again because I found it disgusting she'd encourage stealing from me and taking my mom's money.

62,1g4vc4e,AITA for not letting my SO’s brother and Gf with 2 young kids come live with us? ,"I’m a full-time night shift nurse and full-time student, while my significant other (SO) works from home. We’re in our late twenties with no kids, just our pets. My SO’s brother (31) and his girlfriend (23) have two young kids (1.5 and 2 years old). For the past 4-5 years, they've struggled with homelessness, living with various family members but never staying long. Every time, they claim the problem was the people they stayed with, not them. They’ve lived in our town before, but only briefly, and now they’re moving back.
They’re irresponsible, constantly making poor decisions, and they don’t take advice well. My SO and I have helped them with money, storage, and babysitting, but we've never offered to let them live with us due to their track record and the fear of ruining our relationship with them.
Now they’re moving back to town, and the weather is getting colder. They never directly ask to live with us, but they drop hints about their homelessness and difficult situation. We feel bad for them, but they haven’t held long-term jobs, and every time we help, it doesn’t lead anywhere—they lose or sell what we give them. For example, they left their second vehicle at Costco, where it got towed because they hadn’t paid registration.
They’re now crammed into a small sedan and may ask to live/stay with us. They’ve asked to use our garage for storage, which we’re okay with, but I’m wondering if I’m the asshole for not wanting them to stay if they ask, considering their history. My guilt mostly stems from knowing their kids are suffering because of their poor choices. I want to help the kids but not take care of the parents.
We’re afraid that if we let them stay, a short-term arrangement could become long-term, leaving us stuck in an uncomfortable situation. When they come over, they make us feel guilty about the things we have, saying, “I wish we could have something like this.” We’ve given them food and money, but they always subtly come back for more.
I feel terrible for the kids, but am I supposed to let people who call themselves panhandlers live with us just because I feel bad about the cold weather? When does it end? What if letting them stay temporarily turns into something long-term? I truly feel bad, but for our own sanity, I’m not sure we can handle it. AITA?

I grew up not knowing a thing about my bio father. My mom said he didn't want to know me. I believed my mom met my ""step""father when I was 2. As I found out years later, he was my mom's husband when she got pregnant with me, and my bio father was also married. Mom's husband left because he didn't want to raise her affair child but he missed her and they got back together when I was 2, but he always hated/resented me. I did not have a happy childhood. I did not have an extended family to make up for it. So when I was 18 I did Ancestry and found my bio father. This is when I learned the truth. I was rejected by him and his family at the time and told there was no place for me in their family or in their lives. 

When this happened I had made the mistake of telling people and the responses I got were mostly ""reach out to individual members like siblings and parents or cousins because surely someone will want to know"". This became annoying because people could not grasp that it was more than just him who didn't want to know. They also couldn't understand my unwillingness to take the risk of finding more family by tracking individual members down. I stopped telling people after that.

My wife always knew the full truth. She told me her parents might get a little Hallmarkey and want me to do the whole track down individuals thing so I never gave them the full truth. I just said I could never find him.

So ILs show up at the house while my wife is gone and they say they heard my wife and I discuss the rejection via my paternal bio side. They said they understood me lying but they were there to convince me to take the leap I refused to make in the past and find more family members I could reach out to. I told them I was not interested and had been rejected by enough people in my life who were supposed to care about me in some way and I would not do it again. I told them it was not worth it to me. To please respect that. They would not let it go. They told me I wasn't wrong but I wasn't right and to think about the happiness it would bring me and how you never know if one person related through blood might like to know their relatives. They told me I shouldn't let fear make decisions for me and they told me ""as the parental figures now in my life"" I should listen to them. I told them to stop or I would need them to leave. They said I should accept that multiple people giving me the same advice are right. They told me to stop denying myself. I told them to stop telling me what to do, mind their own business and stay in their lane instead of trying to bulldoze what they think is best. Then I made them leave. They were so angry but my wife was on my side and she told them they should have accepted my decision.

I told them I was not interested and had been rejected by enough people in my life who were supposed to care about me in some way and I would not do it again. I told them it was not worth it to me. To please respect that. They would not let it go. They told me I wasn't wrong but I wasn't right and to think about the happiness it would bring me and how you never know if one person related through blood might like to know their relatives. They told me I shouldn't let fear make decisions for me and they told me ""as the parental figures now in my life"" I should listen to them. I told them to stop or I would need them to leave. They said I should accept that multiple people giving me the same advice are right. They told me to stop denying myself. I told them to stop telling me what to do, mind their own business and stay in their lane instead of trying to bulldoze what they think is best. Then I made them leave. They were so angry but my wife was on my side and she told them they should have accepted my decision.

She's on the spectrum but it's not severe enough where she doesn't comprehend what she's doing. She knows what she does is either right or wrong but she still does it despite it.
  
There have been plenty of times where l've caught her taking my things and looking through my things I've told my mom and siblings about it and at first they all sided with me. They grounded her, took away her things but because she threw a tantrum, they gave in and went back on their word.
 
I've bought some things that have been limited edition and I keep them secured in a display case. Well she got into that and ruined everything. She got into a signed CD album that I had and ripped it all. She broke a limited edition figurine that my brother bought for me and a few other small limited edition items. I ripped one into her saying that I am never going to get any of these items back. She started crying. My mom came and took her side saying I should have never bought them because ""we know how she is"". I told her it's not my fault, I kept them behind the display case, where it has a lock and she broke the lock and deliberately ruined everything. My mom added that I should buy them all again and stop complaining.
 
My sisters (27f & 24f) both ripped one into me saying, l shouldn't have been selfish with my money and bought her some items as well. I was fuming because they didn't get it. My limited edition items were ruined and all they care about was the fact that I didn't buy her anything. I started to yell at them saying how inconsiderate they were being and how if it was theirs, they would have been the same as me. I said that it's unfair how I have to put their needs above mine half of the time because they can't get their heads out of their ass. I tell them that these items she ruined are no longer available. And even if they were, I wouldn't be paying, it would be them buying it for me as an apology for what my little sister did. I went in and yelled at them some more saying that I'm always considered last and how it seems that my mom favors all my other siblings over me and how I always have to carry the burden of paying for mostly everything, even though my other siblings have jobs. My mom said that if I was that unhappy with supporting them, I should just leave and rent my own apartment. I told her I couldn't as my older sister has access to my bank account and she takes more than half my check every paycheck and leaves me with just enough to cover my bills and I still have to pitch in when we go to the store even though I don't buy anything.

66,1g4uldc,AITA for not telling my husband we should still host Thanksgiving and Christmas this year?,"My husband (27m) and I (26f) had our first child in June. We had previously been very close to his family but since our son's arrival things have strained tremendously. My ILs have a tradition where each generation alternates the grandparents names for first and middle names. My husband's middle name is his grandfather's first name. FIL has his grandfather's first name as a first name. Our son was meant to have FILs name as his first name. Or this is what my ILs hoped for. But my husband and I wanted to choose names that we liked. My husband actually hated his name. He felt like he got a dated name because of the tradition and wanted to avoid it for our son too. We ended up choosing a name they didn't like or approve of which made the whole thing more tense. They spent weeks trying to convince us to change it and my husband shielded me from hearing most of it, but I was still aware he was experiencing their attempts on a pretty much daily basis. He ended up blocking them from our phones for a temporary period. He calmed down and told them they were not to bring it up again and he was not going to tolerate them pressuring me.

My PP period has been rough. Even now I'm still not doing as good as I had hoped to be. But the first three months PP were three of the worst months of my life, and I feel so guilty saying that because I love my son more than I love anyone or anything. But I was miserable those first three months and I'm still not ""there"" yet. It's improving.

My ILs quietened down at first but the first time we saw them again after everything, they brought it up again and said they wanted us both to hear them express why they were so upset. My husband told them no. Then his family mentioned Thanksgiving and Christmas. We were supposed to host and they brought up how awkward it would be with tension lingering. My husband said they're right so we won't host or join them this year because it wouldn't be good for me or our son.

His family begged me twice since then to tell my husband we should still do it. They brought up how I had offered and had been looking forward to it. And I was. But not so much now. I'm worried they will turn it into two miserable experiences when I'm still not at my best. My son needs a mom who isn't a shell of herself. I don't want it to turn into family holidays where everyone talks about how much they hate the name and how we made the wrong choice. But a part of me feels guilty for my stance because we don't have another extended family and we got along so good before this.

67,1g4ufbb,AITA for being sad that my boyfriend never invites me to stuff anymore since moving in together and seeing each other every day.,"So recently I’ve been feeling idk sad or mad? at my boyfriend. I feel like he never invites me to do stuff.
Recently we moved in together for real for the first time and I asked him if he wanted to celebrate on a Saturday (he never initiates this kind of stuff) and he said yes but not on Saturday because he’s meeting his friends. So we plan Sunday, and then he comes home incredibly drunk I tells me he doesn’t want to celebrate on Sunday because he’s too drunk. But he never tried to even reschedule, so the next weekend I ask him again and he says he can’t because he’s friend is having a concert. And yet again he never tried reschedule so I just gave up. And I feel like stuff like this happens a bit too often, for instance I’ll invite him to hangout with my friends and he pretty much always declines. I can’t even remember last time he met some of my friends. And I feel sad because I never say no to him if he ever invites me to something with his friends, family or alone. I always make time.

But recently he’s not even inviting me to anything. A few months ago one of his close friends had a birthday and he told me he’s going, and I’ve met her multiple times before so I asked if she invited me too. He said he didn’t know and didn’t ask, and asked me if I wanted him to ask her. I swallowed my pride and said yes. A week later when he did ask she answered she just assumed I’d come too. But hadn’t I asked him to ask her, I wouldn’t known I was invited. Which makes me sad and I feel pushy and intrusive. I also found out that another friend of theirs immediately asked her if his girlfriend was invited, which made me even more sad that my bf didn’t.

And he’s met his friends every now and then but never invited me even though the friend’s partner is joining

Yesterday I found out from hearing him talk with his mom that some relatives invited us to dinner on Sunday, I asked him about it and he said “oh yea they invited us, I forgot to ask you if you want to join”.. which made me so sad because I feel like I only get invited because his family reminds him or invites me.
At the same time he also told me that on Saturday his friend whom Ive met before is having a house warming party and yet again he didn’t invite me. I don’t know if I’m invited or if my bf even asked if I was invited. So now I feel a bit sad.

What should I do? Am I unreasonable to be sad about him not inviting me to do stuff, especially with his friends. And am I right to be upset about feeling like I’m the only one that invites him and tries to plan stuff for us to do together?

68,1g4u3sz,WIBTA: Throwing away GF bong,"

So long story short I used to smoke back in college but gave it up when I started working. During this time I had a female friend who I studied with and we smoked once or twice together. Fast forward we found out a few months ago we in the same town and started to meet up, we know dated and on the first date we spoke about smoking. She told me she also stopped after college but after 3 months of dating officially she came out and told me she still smokes every day after work. This hit me hard and she promised she would stop.

Last night I came over after work and I swear I smelt it on her breath and her eyes where red, she was allot more quite than usual. So I asked and she said she hadn't smoked. Still she has her 3 bongs in the house and a bunch of weed she hides from me. The one bong still has water in it so I'm thinking if your not using it you surely would throw the water out? Also why keep it if she said the last time she smoked was the day before she told me she still did, then what's the point of keeping all this shit?

I am very tempted and am being told from friends to just take everything and throw it out without talking to her first. I guess I want to know how you guys would react to that? If you have given it up and swear you don't smoke anymore would you still keep all your bongs and have weed in the house or would you have thrown it all away?

To me it just feels that she's keeping it all because she still hits it on the sly without me knowing.

Edit: It’s more of a matter of lying than it is about the smoking. Why come out and say you’re going to stop and still do it behind my back. It’s simple to be honest and say you’re not going to stop. Truth is she wants to move in with me and I’m not dealing with this then. ",Asshole,2024-10-16,"WIBTA: Throwing away GF bong

She thinks I am being unreasonable, and that a baby will have little impact on the holiday. I disagree with her and think a baby will have a huge impact.

I wouldn't have a problem if it was just the parents, but that isn't realistic.

Today our dog had to go to the vet but my husband works out on certain days in the morning so I had to to get myself ready while watching the baby, get the baby ready, walk the dog, pack everything, drop off the baby at day care, and drop off the dog at the vet. (Note he did offer to take the baby to day care but I had to get her ready and leave by 6:30 am and he doesn’t finish working out until 8:30 am and the baby can’t just hang out by herself for 2 hours??? But he says he offered and I rejected him so it is my fault he didn’t help.) Then after the vet, I had to go into work where I missed the vet call so they didn’t do a procedure that my dog needed so then I had to go pick him up, bring him home, pump, walk him again, and then go back to work. I didn’t even eat all day. I finished some meetings and had to pick up the baby from daycare since my husband had a meeting, rush home to take another meeting at home where I had to present while holding a loud baby, feed the dog, feed the baby, shower the baby, clean, and finish laundry. My husband came back with dinner but barely said anything to me. The baby threw up on me and it was dripping all over and my husband just looked at me and did nothing so I annoyedly asked him to get me a paper towel and he acted like it was such an inconvenience for him. I got mad and said that I couldn’t believe that he couldn’t even say thank you for taking care of everything for our family today and instead can’t even get me a paper towel without giving me attitude. Then he ignored me for the rest of the night without saying anything, so I had to also watch the baby while trying to finish working for the night. I confronted him again later and he told me that if I schedule appointments at an inconvenient time for him, i.e. his work out days or anytime he has meetings (which he has a lot of) then it’s my fault so I need to deal with it myself so he has no need to be appreciative of me since I brought this upon myself. But that’s assuming I can just schedule appointments any time I want, especially ones that need to be handled asap (my dog has a broken tooth that could get infected so I had to make the earliest appointment possible). There is no convenient appointment. But it’s ok for him if I have to handle everything even if I have meetings. He always says he resents me for making all the baby or dog decisions, even though he has no interest in most baby things I ask him to be involved in. I feel like that’s just his cop out way of not having to do any baby thing or even be civil to me by just blaming me for being “controlling”. If I was actually controlling then I’d privacy get at least some help. Besides day care which started 3 months ago, I do 99% of the caretaking.

My husband came back with dinner but barely said anything to me. The baby threw up on me and it was dripping all over and my husband just looked at me and did nothing so I annoyedly asked him to get me a paper towel and he acted like it was such an inconvenience for him. I got mad and said that I couldn’t believe that he couldn’t even say thank you for taking care of everything for our family today and instead can’t even get me a paper towel without giving me attitude. Then he ignored me for the rest of the night without saying anything, so I had to also watch the baby while trying to finish working for the night. I confronted him again later and he told me that if I schedule appointments at an inconvenient time for him, i.e. his work out days or anytime he has meetings (which he has a lot of) then it’s my fault so I need to deal with it myself so he has no need to be appreciative of me since I brought this upon myself. But that’s assuming I can just schedule appointments any time I want, especially ones that need to be handled asap (my dog has a broken tooth that could get infected so I had to make the earliest appointment possible). There is no convenient appointment. But it’s ok for him if I have to handle everything even if I have meetings. He always says he resents me for making all the baby or dog decisions, even though he has no interest in most baby things I ask him to be involved in. I feel like that’s just his cop out way of not having to do any baby thing or even be civil to me by just blaming me for being “controlling”. If I was actually controlling then I’d privacy get at least some help. Besides day care which started 3 months ago, I do 99% of the caretaking. The crazy thing is that I wasn’t even trying to blame him today for not helping at all. Am I crazy for thinking that I deserve a little appreciation?",0.0,0.04163626,0,1

Another example is when I told them I was 9 months clean and relapsed and was sad they told me ""the longest I have stayed clean was 4 moths"" which I also didn't appreciate.
But to solve the problem I wanted to talk. I started the conversation pretty pissed but I still tried to make my point clear of what I wanted from them.

(I know I'm an Asshole, but looking for help)
I own a small shop.
I have two employees.
A has been here for a bit over 5 years.
About 2 years ago I hired B.
Things seemed to be going well for 14 months.
About 8 months ago B told me that they found some of the things that A would say to be toxic, and was occasionally having a hard time working with them.
B did not elaborate much.  I know that B can be a bit easy to gross out, so I've tried to keep conversations like that to a minimum.  I probably was told that some of the negative gossip that A engages in was a problem.
B explicitly asked me not to discuss the situation with A.
I agreed, thinking this would be short lived.

This is my big mistake.  Keeping this secret has been a weight.

At some point B told me that they do not trust A, as they have seen how they treat ex-friends online, and how they talk about those ex-friends.
They started coming in early and leaving early, but many times A and B would work together for hours, while other days B would skip to avoid A.
B started wearing headphones around A when conversations became “inappropriate”.

Two months ago A noticed that something was wrong
They are incredibly mad that their close friend B was not actually their friend.
They are incredibly mad about the lack of communication of the issue.
Neither A or B were willing to work with each other.
B was assigned to the morning, while A was assigned to the evening.  This cut into both of their hours.  I no longer have a day off.
At some point B asked to go back to overlapping shifts, but A was against that.
Last week we had a staff meeting, after a few failed attempts earlier in the week.  It did not go well.  I started by apologizing for keeping the secret that I was asked to keep, and for the harm the lack of communication caused.  B had typed up a list/speech in order to keep their thoughts straight.
A hated that.
B seemed to take some of the blame for the situation.
A responded blaming everyone but themselves.  Said the meeting was organized to attack them.  (side note A asked for the meeting).  Did not believe that B ever informed them of any harm that they had done.
One of the issues could be taken as sexual harrassment, but it seems that both contributed.
A stated that the restricted hours hurt them more because they have children, and that they should have more hours, but not with B there.
Eventually I attempted to broker peace, and apologize again, but was interrupted continuously be A.
At some point B asked to be excused, and A was not happy about that.

76,1g4t0cj,AITA for refusing to attend my mother-in-law's overnight wedding party ,"My mother in law is getting married in 2 weeks. They started planning the wedding in July. Me, my husband and our 6 months old daughter have been invited before there were any concrete plans for the wedding.

This weekend we visited her for lunch and finally found out what the plans actually are. 
There will be a ceremony at 3pm, after that all guests are invited to a phone free wedding party in a close by restaurant/hotel.  She told us they already reserved one hotel room for the guests to leave phones and other things at and later for our daughter to sleep while we party with them until morning. 

I refused to stay overnight. I explained that our daughter needs a baby monitor because she stopped breathing a few times before and the monitor saved her. I'd need my phone for the baby cam but she wouldn't make an exception. Also leaving her alone in a hotel room while any of the drunk wedding guests can freely enter the room isn't something I'm comfortable with. I'd stay up there with her anyway and at that point we can just take a 10 minute walk home. 

My husband said we'll attend the ceremony and the dinner after it but me and the baby will leave when people start drinking. He'll stay until morning. 

 I've tried my best not to offend her but I was very unsuccessful. She took it as me saying that her friends (guests) would do something to my daughter. Told me that baby monitors are useless, they didn't have these modern things and both her son's are still alive. She also accused me of conspiring with Katie. My husband has a brother and Katie is his fiancee. They had an argument two weeks prior and both refused to attend the wedding. 

Lastly she told us that she will consider if we're even still invited. Her fiance refused to help us move until we solve solve it. 

I understand it's an important day for her and she's angry that it's not going exactly according to the plan. But she could've asked before making it a plan. Also all the guests are strangers to both me and my husband.

We hadn't been very much more than distant friends for a while but I guess this was enough for A because he has a crush on me. A's crush has been incredibly obvious: calling me things like husband, my love, saying we'll get married one day. I thought it was jokes at first but it was obvious after a while it wasn't, but I still didn't say anything. I wasn't uncomfortable with it, I just didn't want to date A. I'm not gay.



I've been trying to think of ways we can still be friends and I can reject him the nicest way i can but it's not easy. I've tried twice and couldn't really get the words out so I just didn't do it.



A mutual friend of ours doesn't like how I treat A. N(16m) says that I'm not good friend to A, because A is almost always around me but I don't really know anything about him but A knows so much about me. He says I don't deserve to be A's friend because I never even thought to ask, which I agree with. I haven't been the best friend but I'm not really good at talking to people. I want to try and do more but it's hard for me, IDK why. N also hated the idea I had of rejecting A after one of our study sessions because then I'd be using him.

I still want to be friends I just don't want anything romantic. My friends disagree with that aswell. N says that blushing and being jealous isn't normal, but I haven't done either. I think they're just bullshitting me because it has become a joke in the group that I'm secretly in love with A or something. Again, not gay. But last person who doesn't really like the way I treat A is his brother. He thinks I'm going to hurt A but I'm not trying to.



Which it all kinda got to a boiling point during our most recent study session. A was trying to help me with math when somebody knocked and I went to go get it and his brother just came in all pissed off. I was really confused and his brother just kept laying into me, trying to get A to go home before saying that I had a girlfriend and that I was justusing A for my grade.



I did lie about having a girlfriend to some friends because I wanted them to leave me alone about being single at our parties, but I never told A's brother or anybody else outside of those 2 friends But I didn't know what to do so I just agreed I had a girlfriend. He got really quiet and just went to go get his things and his brother kept calling me a POS before they left. He's been avoiding me at school now after we had a talk and he apologized saying he didn't know I had a GF and now he won't talk to me at all.

A was trying to help me with math when somebody knocked and I went to go get it and his brother just came in all pissed off. I was really confused and his brother just kept laying into me, trying to get A to go home before saying that I had a girlfriend and that I was justusing A for my grade.



I did lie about having a girlfriend to some friends because I wanted them to leave me alone about being single at our parties, but I never told A's brother or anybody else outside of those 2 friends But I didn't know what to do so I just agreed I had a girlfriend. He got really quiet and just went to go get his things and his brother kept calling me a POS before they left. He's been avoiding me at school now after we had a talk and he apologized saying he didn't know I had a GF and now he won't talk to me at all.



I think that's all the important stuff, but IDK. I may respond to comments if it calls but I just wanna know if AITA here? Because I didn't intend for this to happen so I' wouldn't think so but I feel awful.",0.0,1.046711,1,0
79,1g4smuo,AITA for cooking for my best friend but not my sister,"I’m a good cook. I don’t think I could be a professional but cooking has been a hobby for me for years and people tend to like what I make. 

My best friend is a single mom to the cutest 6 year old girl. My friend has never been the best cook. She tries but her food never comes out great so at least once a week I get a face time call from her daughter basically saying “auntie op, can you please come over and make dinner?

I can’t say no to that kid so I come over and make dinner every Thursday while my husband is out with his friends and they come over for Sunday dinner. 

My sister is in residency and simply doesn’t have time to cook every day. She’s asked if I could help her out by cooking for her a couple times a week and she’ll pay for the ingredients. I thought about it but decided not to. I don’t want to cook for myself and my husband then make a second meal and drop it off to her apartment. She’s also picky and can be hard to cook for and hates trying new foods. She pushed a little bit but eventually accepted that I won’t be cooking for her. 

She had Sunday off and FaceTimed me while we were getting ready for dinner. My friends daughter is my little assistant so she was in the background of the call. When she asked what she was doing there, I explained that they come over for Sunday dinner every week. My friends daughter also decided this is when she’s going to join the conversation and said I also come over and make dinner every Thursday. 

My sister hung up on me and later that night she texted me saying she can’t believe I cook for them twice a week but won’t do it for her. I told her that I get to eat with them, not make 2 separate meals, plus all of them eat whatever I make (with the exception of seafood. 6yo says it looks scary).

Prior to the dinner we had all chosen our formal tables and one of the girls from my best friends group (one of the girls who had been talking) had put me down with them and I had no issues whatsoever since I got along with them well. But after the dinner I just didn’t want to sit with them anymore since I knew there would be speeches at that event too. So, after the dinner when we were asked to finalise the tables I moved myself from their table to the one with my other close group of friends. I felt like an asshole doing it without telling anyone and not consulting my best friend at least. I’ve always struggled with speaking my mind so it leads me to make irrational decisions like this.

81,1g4sguk,"WIBTA for taking a dream job, potentially locking my wife and I into a city we don't like living in?","I (30M) work as a consultant with only a single client. This client is my only source of income. My wife (29F) does not work. She is able, she just chooses not to, which I'm fine with because she cooks and cleans.

A year ago, we moved from Cali to cut our expenses in the hopes of starting a family soon. We chose the current state we're in because it's close to my brother's fam. We were hopeful we'd settle in and find our own groove here, but it just hasn't happened. Although we love spending time with them, we both really dislike the day-to-day of living here. We both equally and willingly made the decision to move here, and it's not like I dragged her over. We both agreed we'd move soon (6-12mo) to the city we both ultimately want to be in (her especially) when it was reasonable to do so.

At the time, my client told me they had about a years worth of work lined up for me, which I'm almost at the end of now, as expected. I told my wife when we moved here I'd try to network and find clients in our current area to keep the income coming when my current gig would eventually run dry.

Over the past year, I've occasionally researched conferences, networking events, and the overall job market in my area, but honestly each time I looked the prospects weren't great. Over the last couple months I became increasingly anxious about not being able to find work. I realized I had to lock something in quickly before we'd have to start eating into our savings, so I began aggressively applying to any job I was remotely qualified for.

Today, I struck gold with a high profile company who was my number one prospect. It feels like a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me career-wise and I feel lucky as hell to have landed it since this company is not easy to get into. The caveat is I'd be taking a hefty pay cut and could potentially be locked into this city for more than a year as it is hands-on work. I told my wife that our plans of moving to our dream city haven't changed, but it could be delayed. This feels like the best option to bring money in the short term.

Now my wife's pissed for a few reasons, mainly because I'd be taking a pay cut because I didn't try hard enough to find local clients like I said I would, and two, because she feels as if this is all detracting from our plans to move in the near future. She's also stressed that money will be tighter, especially when trying to add a child into the mix. I do sympathize with her concerns and in all honestly, I probably could've put more effort into finding clients to keep my current pay, but it wasn't a guarantee either. It's not like I was sitting on my ass though, I was working my current job.

With the new job, I'd still make enough to cover all our expenses, PLUS extra for multiple vacations and personal luxuries like shopping and eating out. We don't have debt and we have a good chunk of savings.

They started dancing to some music together and we cheered them on, and after a little while of that my boyfriend went downstairs to our own apartment to take care of something real quick.

During that 5-7 minutes of my boyfriend being gone, my neighbor pulled me up off the couch and tried to “teach me how to dance,” and though I told him I don’t really dance he insisted on teaching me. Unfortunately I don’t know how to confront people when I’m uncomfortable so I dealt with it, barely moving along with what was happening and hoped it would end quickly before my boyfriend came back and saw me dancing with another man because I knew what would happen wouldn’t be pretty. It ended shortly before my boyfriend came back and I pulled him aside and told him immediately, and we left shortly after. I also told him about a few other times where my neighbor has gotten a little too touchy with me whenever he wasn’t around.

Since then my boyfriend has had a couple conversations with our neighbor about everything that’s happened, first one the neighbor was drunk to no avail and then a second time tonight when he was sober. My bf talked to him about “bro code” and set boundaries for our neighbor not to talk to me or touch me when my bf isn’t around.

Here’s where the story gets weird: he’s acting like he hasn’t done anything wrong, told his wife that we’re accusing him of trying to get with me, and now they’re both treating us like we’re weird for setting those boundaries.

I took a gap year to raise money for myself as they are not providing any financial aid further for my education. And I understand. I am not entitled to a college fund. With this in mind, we started an agreement in September 2023 that to remain in residence at their home, I would start up at a community college in September 2024, but I misunderstood the deadline to register for classes, and could not find a spot available in any class I needed to take even after the drop date. My mother's heated response was, ""This is why you are not an adult."" Which I believe is about the learning disabilities that I was diagnosed with in elementary school.

My father does not believe that this happened, and since this, has pushed the narrative in the house that I am ""A lazy, spoiled bitch."" due to now being unemployed but actively seeking a job, but not in school. Unfortunately, my father struggles with very intense periods of PTSD-induced rage as a result of his service in Iraq as a captain in the US Army, and I am now the sole target of it. I try to be understanding of my father, even when he screams at me until his face is red, as I know he only went to Iraq to pay for my hospitalization as an infant, and the expensive medication I used to take at that time.

 I will admit my mother is also in a difficult position between my father and I butting heads.

 I will also respect her duty to her marriage but, she has taken my father's side and claims that due to having a traveling job now, she ""cannot be sure"" if I tell the truth in sharing my perspective of the arguments I have with my father.  I presented a conversation to my parents about moving out with my boyfriend not too long ago. My siblings must've overheard this conversation and are convinced history is repeating itself, as my older sister ran away on her 18th birthday with her s/o in the middle of the night and dropped out of high school as a result of her being off of medication for mental illness. She is now safe but not at home.

My mother claims that I am a destructive force in her house due to the decline in relationships, and has openly stated she no longer wants me there, but will not have me move out with him. After some discussion, the only route she approves is for me to attend a university associated with our religion. 

I broke up with my very loving boyfriend earlier today with a broken heart, to try and open up his life to possibilities of love and happiness from another woman who isn’t so complicated.

84,1g4s2rb,AITA for blocking them from the WiFi?,"Ok, so I’m the landlord, and these three guys are renting a house. They’re roommates. Their contract says they’re responsible for their own utilities, but they asked me how to get internet service. I gave them a few options because there aren’t many providers around here. I need high-speed internet because I work remotely, so I was thinking of getting Starlink for myself (I live next door). Since it’s expensive, I paid for the equipment and we agreed to split the monthly cost four ways — between me and the three of them.

We talked about it for two days, and then they started bugging me like little kids, “When are you getting the WiFi?” “Yes, we want it!” “Yes, we agree to split the monthly fee.” I kept asking, “Are you sure? No turning back?” They all said yes, so I went ahead and installed it. I was also in a rush because I needed to set up a security camera.

One guy paid his share right away, another took about four days, and the last guy — who’s been flirting with me since we signed the contract 🙄🙄🙄 — had the nerve to say, “Nah, I’m not gonna pay you. I’m not using the WiFi. My phone data is enough.” I told him, “Well, you agreed to pay, so you need to.”

Later, when I went to the house to fix something, he tells me, “Oh, you’re so mean to me, you don’t talk to me. You’re being weird with me” (because apparently, I don’t respond to his flirty texts). “And you’re stingy, not sharing the WiFi password.” 🙄 I just left. But I know from his WhatsApp stories that he’s using it because he’s posting stories of him watching TV, and I can hear him blasting YouTube music. 

Now it’s the second month of WiFi. Luckily, I can track who’s using it, and he definitely is. So, I’m deducting it from his deposit. They haven’t paid me for the second month, so I blocked them from the WiFi. And of course, they all complained 🙄🙄🙄 and had the nerve to ask, “Can you check why the WiFi isn’t working?” I lied and said, “It’s not working because I haven’t paid the bill; I have no money.” And then one of them says, “Well, pay it. I told you I’d give you the money today.”
Becuase for context flirty guy and the friend were late on their rent and I told them about the 10% interest rate stipulated on the contract and they agreed. 
I had to go knock on his door to collect the late rent with interest, but they only paid the regular rent and said, “I’ll pay the interest tomorrow, but I don’t know about the WiFi.” Oh, and to make it worse, the router is located at their home so probably I’ll have to change  it to mine 

the flirty guy and his friend were 15 days late paying rent, and only one of them actually paid the WiFi and rent on time.
Now one of them complained that I’m blocking them but tbh I think is unfair they are demanding me to solve their problems (getting the internet) demanding as soon as it is not working to pay it when they haven’t pay me his share, and they are using it and deciding to pay me whenever they want

85,1g4rpay,AITA- for lying to my friend and leaving a group of people?,"I was invited to a football event last Friday and there were 2 football games that happened that day. One for the JR and one for the SR. The original plan was for everyone in our group (around 5-7 and later more) to watch both games. Later on in the night our group would grow Since we are all JR and the JR game started first which we have friends on the JR team? In the group of people, there are 2 people who dislike me for no good reason other for me being a goofball which I can be sometimes but in my opinion it’s not a reason to hate/dislike someone. When I got to the event. Everything was calm, nothing wrong. During the 2nd period the two people I dislike go and grab popcorn from one of the food stands and start throwing it at me. After a couple times it got annoying and I just started throwing the popcorn they threw at me back to them.

Which I knew was complete BS cause one that doesn’t make sense and two they don’t value my life they don’t even like me. At this point they were pretty much saying a lot of shit to me to a point where I wanted to leave. I have another friend in the stands who the group didn’t like much, after I told her everything that was happening to me, we both agreed after the JR game we would leave. Once the game was over I was leaving and saw my best friend who was on the team while I was walking out. He asked me where I was going and when I told him that the two people who didn’t like me where doing all this stuff. He told me to come sit with him. I knew he was going to sit near them so I just left. While I’m out he texts me calling me a fa**ot saying I’m gay for leaving with her. This is where I might’ve fucked up cause I told him I wasn’t with her and he was just acting a bitch and calling me shit. After that people are on his side while some our taking mine but it’s gotten pretty bad that today a group of friends called me and it was just them flipping me off calling me a bitch. Idk if I’m in the wrong or not and what to do.

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA- for lying to my friend and leaving a group of people? I was invited to a football event last Friday and there were 2 football games that happened that day. One for the JR and one for the SR. The original plan was for everyone in our group (around 5-7 and later more) to watch both games. Later on in the night our group would grow Since we are all JR and the JR game started first which we have friends on the JR team? In the group of people, there are 2 people who dislike me for no good reason other for me being a goofball which I can be sometimes but in my opinion it’s not a reason to hate/dislike someone. When I got to the event. Everything was calm, nothing wrong. During the 2nd period the two people I dislike go and grab popcorn from one of the food stands and start throwing it at me. After a couple times it got annoying and I just started throwing the popcorn they threw at me back to them. At this point they started throwing popcorn at another person who they didn’t like and swearing on MY life they didn’t throw it. When I asked why they said “cause we value your life so much”. Which I knew was complete BS cause one that doesn’t make sense and two they don’t value my life they don’t even like me.

My sister and I are best friends, but my husband and I are ready to have our house back for our family. My husband and I have high sex drives, and this entire time we’ve tried keeping it as quiet as we can be and respectful with them here.

I have received standing ovation for my plays, people have called me a year after watching my short film & told me how they still remember that feel & the particular scene that has stayed in their minds.
But I am yet to get that break & my family situation is such that my brother cries in depression, my mother has a high BP problem & here I am, in a small debt, pursuing my dream & applying for jobs, but getting neither.

89,1g4r167,AITA for refusing to change our son’s name?,"My husband and I recently had our second child. I told my husband that he could pick the first name for our second child since I picked the first name for our first child. For the last nine months, I asked my husband to come up with a first name for our son. Everytime I brought it up in the beginning, he’d roll his eyes and tell me he couldn’t think about it right now. So I backed off, until we hit the third trimester and then I asked him again. He kept blowing me off and at one point jokingly threw out a very old fashioned name that was difficult to pronounce. So I came up with a list of names with one name in particular that I loved. The name was Matteo and its meaning is “gift of god”. Having suffered an ectopic pregnancy prior to this baby, it meant a lot to me. I mentioned the name to my husband and it seemed like he liked the name. This is where I acknowledged that I fucked up. My aunt asked if we had names and I clearly stated that nothing concrete but I had a name I loved and it was in consideration and told her. She took the name and ran with it, told everyone and began calling our unborn child by this name. This pissed my husband off immensely and he demanded we take the name off the table. I understood, I was disappointed but understood. So I offered up other names for us to consider. A week before my due date, I brought up the names again and said I’d like to at least have a couple of names that we can talk about for consideration. He blows me off again. I said that I’m not having any in depth conversation about names in the hospital and would rather we go in with maybe two names and once we see him we can make the decision there.

I said ok, that’s a nickname we won’t use and he was ok with my response. I fill out form while he’s there but he doesn’t look at it and leaves the hospital room.

There was no discussion about spelling. To be honest I don’t like the Mateo spelling and prefer Matteo. If there was any disagreement on spelling I would have taken the name off the table and gone with Liam. He’s now holding this over my head and is pissed.

Today, I was busy caring for our kids, pumping milk, cleaning, doing laundry and making food. I still, however, took time to put on makeup and a cute dress only 10min before my husband arrived. I had the intention of making the kids sleep early so that we can have time alone because we rarely have time. 
Intimacy has been rare for us because time passes so quickly and we are both exhausted at the end of the day. 
My husband goes to work at 6am and comes home around 5pm and he ate his meal and went to the gym. I put our toddler to sleep, did the dishes after dinner, pumped milk, fed the baby, and while i was making baby sleep, he came home. 
I told him I needed time to make the baby sleep and he said he's tired and went to wash up. He then came out and i'm still tryna make the baby sleep and he got frustrated that I wasn't quick enough. I finally put the baby to sleep and it took like 5min after he finished taking a shower so it wasn't long. 

I went to check on my husband and he said ""is the baby asleep?"" and i said ""yea"" so he opened his arms for me to come and as i approached him, i heard our toddler coughing and gagging so i ran to check on her, gave her water and came back to my husband. He was still awake but ignored me. I waited a bit for him to talk to me or something but i was too late and i guess he just wanted to sleep.

91,1g4qs3b,AITA For Stopping My Niblings From Being Adopted?,"6 years ago, my (M25) cousin Brenda (F24) got pregnant. Despite not wanting a child and being in no position to raise one, she was bullied by my anti-choice and not pro-life family into going through with the pregnancy. Many relatives promised to support (money, supplies, babysitting, etc) but hung her to dry after just a few months.

In the present day, my sister Sarah (F34) lost her kids James (m5), Jack (M6) and Jane (f8) to CPS, and my other cousin Tara (F36) agreed to adopt. This should be the end of the story, except that my mother resents me for being childfree and unsuccessfully tried to pressure me to adopt. She made several passive aggressive remarks during a family get-together, calling me lazy, selfish, cowardly, etc and how it should have been me. But when she said that everyone would've helped out had I adopted, I called her out on her BS; I pointed out that the exact same promises were made to Brenda, and they (my mom was one of them) reneged on it.

Most of my relatives (that I indirectly called out) alternated between yelling at me and assuring Tara that Brenda (unlike Tara) was only abandoned because she was a w\*\*\*\*, and I've received a significant amount of backlash. Tara is also no longer going through with the adoption. She privately thanked me, admitting that she had been counting on our relatives' promises of support, and it hadn't occurred to her that they'd abandon her. She also had only agreed to adopt James out of obligation/family pressure, and that I'd given her an out. While I don't see anything morally wrong with what I did, I do feel bad because Tara was the only option where the kids would not have to be split up. AITA?

I work later today so during that time I'm gonna ask my GM to put me on the Christmas shifts and just tell my family my manager asked me to work to give a coworker the ability to go see family they haven't been able to see in ages. I appreciate y'all's comments and advice so much. This situation has had me emotionally frazzled for a bit so I appreciate outside thoughts and words ♥️

Edit 2: Manager has agreed and promised to put me on the Christmas shift. I do get time and a half and I've been told by coworkers that people tip pretty well. So that money will go towards a vacation to see my partner ♥️♥️",0.0,0.0146092195,0,1

I clarified with all other bridesmaids who have children and they assumed no children until ceremony time. 

One of my bridesmaids has dropped out of my wedding because I told her that her baby (will be 4 months old at the time of wedding) cannot be there with us all morning while getting ready. I told her I do not want any children at the venue until at least 1-2ish. I have my own children who will not be there until shortly before photos. I was willing to compromise and let whoever is watching her baby bring them to the venue after we are done getting ready so she can feed them and have a break but would need her back for photos.

96,1g4q1b8,AITA for pointing out that I didn’t like an item that was used in a dish? ,"For context my husband (M32) and I (F30) let his sister (Lisa, F29) move in with us a year and a half ago because she was running into financial hardships.


For the past year and a half my husband and I do most of the cooking. In Lisa mind, she is a highly experienced chief and won't hear anything about her cooking other than praise.  


I also hate onions with a burning passion. I have had people try to sneak it into my food without me noticing and I can always tell.


Well recently my husband's job started later and he doesn’t get off until 9 now when he used to get off at 5. So when we were for planing Lisa volunteered to cook pork chops and mashed potatoes. My husband and I were both hesitant because of prior experience-the last time she had made pork chops she used onion and garlic powder- but she said she would make the meal the same way my husband does so we agreed. 


Well today she was making food and I noticed she making it different. I have a terrible sense of smell so I didn’t notice anything off right away. And I didn’t worry too much about it because I’m not that picky and even if it turned out weird I can normally still eat it. 


When I took a bite of it I noticed onion powder right away. I asked Lisa what she put in it and she name onion powder and garlic powder. I didn’t say anything right away because I was trying not to say “I don’t like this” and she says “I know you don’t like it but I only used a little.” And honestly that made me a bit angry so I told her the truth, I didn’t like it. She apologized and I stopped eating. 


I texted my husband at work and told him. He was angry stating she knew very well I hated onions and she had done this before and that she was ignoring what others wanted in favor of what she wanted. I didn't say much other than she had said she didn't use much but I couldn't taste it and I felt bad. When he got home he said he could easily taste it too. For context my husband also doesn't like onions but unlike me he can eat them. I mentioned I felt bad because I know pretty much everyone else likes onions and I’m the odd one out. 


He went to talk with her and said if she wasn't going to do what she said, she should have at least not used onion powder on my food. She got angry and said she was never gonna cook again then called her sister and complained about how she can’t eat onions because I don’t like onions. Which is not the case. The whole reason we have the onion powder was because she uses it on her food. She cooks with onions if she wants too and has before. The only meals we eat together is dinner. I am the only person who does dishes so I know this very well.

97,1g4pur7,AITA for kicking my friend out of a project.,"Throw away, all fake names (pls don't repost) this happened last year but I need other opinions.
So I 17f was friends with Anne 17f for about 5 years before this. We became friends through a mutual, we had a decent friendship and never really fought. But Anne always has to be the victim or have it worse than everyone else.
So we had a project for school where we had to work in groups of 2 or more. Anne had the class a different period but still wanted to be in my group so I told her she had to ask the other 2 members if she could join. This was because I didn't want to make them feel pressured into letting Anne join as neither of them really knew her. Anne never asked one of the girls (sam) and the other girl (kelly) said it was up to Sam. Due to this I ended up asking Sam cus Anne would make up excuses to not ask her. Sam agreed to let her join so we divided the work up, me and Kelly decided on doing about a third each and Sam and Kelly split the rest. This was cus me and Kelly had more freedom than Sam and we didn't want anne to have to do hard parts cus she wouldn't be able to talk to us easily.
 A few days into the project and Kelly wasn't doing the work right and after a bit of going back and forth Kelly and Sam suggested an ultimatum which I agreed to give. I was the only person who saw Anne throughout the day so I had to tell her either do the project correctly or she can't be in the group. I might be the the whole cus I told her this before the only class we had together,  so she couldn't really talk about it to me. I think my timing could've been better but her reaction to the ultimatum was to yell fine I didn't even want to be part of the project and rip up a paper. Latter she texted me saying I blew up at her. We had a few back and forth texts (she refused to talk to me) basically her blaming me for everything, saying that we shouldn't have let her join if we hate her, and saying she doesn't want to involve other people in it (she kept bringing up my friends). Then I would try to understand her pov and explain mine. After about 8 long text paragraphs to and from her I decided to send her a big text saying that it was exhausting to put up with this and that she had also left me out of some stuff so she can't complain that my friends that aren't friends with her don't invite her to stuff. I think I could've handled it better especially cus if  it was in person, I would've yelled at her. At the same time I had been treated like the only reason she was friends with me was to vent about stuff .
Edit: I would like to clarify that when she asked to join, she stopped me in the middle of the hall, I told her she needed to ask the others personally. Some of my replies to her were a bit rude, but for the most part, they weren't. I never told her that it wasn't my idea for the ultimatum, so i can see why she blames me for it.

100,1g4p1j4,AITA for telling someone not even trying to drop out of class? ,"Hi, I'm currently in college right now. We are half way through the semester and there's this girl in my Japanese class that is struggling a lot during class. She memorized nothing on the alphabet, and doesn't even do her homework. The two saving graces is that she actually bought the textbook for the class, and whenever people in the class would host a study session in the library, she would come, but ultimately doesn't understand anything since she is so far behind. We are learning vocabularies, kanji, and basic sentence structures now, and she still doesn't know the alphabet.

Whenever the professor calls on her in class, it would hold the class back for like 20 minutes since she has no idea what's going on and the professor is insistent on keep asking the person they called on until they give the correct answer.

So, fast forward to today. She messaged me on Discord to tutor her, that she will start focusing now. I asked her if she memorized both of the Japanese alphabet yet, and to no surprise, she said no.

I told her to just drop the class then and there. Told her if she really wanted to focus, should have focused since day 1. It's a waste of time and energy focusing now just to get like a D at best if the professor is feeling generous (literally did no homework, failed all quizzes, and failed our first exam with the second one coming soon that uses everything we've learned so far). We only have like 8 weeks of classes left (only 2 class a week). Told her dropping out will save her the time and energy of going to a class she's gonna fail anyway.

She exploded on me. Told me I'm messed up for telling her to just give up. Told me I don't know how busy she her life is.

I asked her why she even signed up for this class if she can't even make time for it and just make up excuses to gain sympathy? Sympathy won't save her grades. (I know that sounds mean. Idk why I said that.)

Got blocked and removed as a friend. Will probably be awkward to see her tomorrow.

He layed down on the other side of the bed facing always from me. I left the room and cried for like 30 minutes. Like it hurts, it’s so stupid but it hurt me a lot. I really don’t think I did anything wrong because ITS A DANG GAME! This happened yesterday and we have said maybe 30 words to each other since. 

Also nothing like this has ever happened before. He’s not one to get angry at me like that about anything. I don’t understand what I did wrong. ",0.0,0.047818817,0,1
102,1g4ob74,AITA for not paying my friend back because I’ve already done so much for her?,"I've (23F) been best friends with this girl (23F), let's call her Sam, since childhood. Her and her boyfriend (23M) broke up two months before their lease ended and she had nowhere else to go. My apartment was close to hers so I decided to let her crash on our couch while she figured out a plan. She seemed to have no plans to move out of my apartment. After noticing this, I asked her if she could help pay $100-$150 for rent at least since money was tight, and she didn't want to. She bought us things such as toilet paper, paper towels, and toothpaste, even though we kept telling her we didn't need them. She had no hobbies so on our days off, she would just lay on our couch all day and watch Tik Toks. She never helped us clean and helped us walk our dog maybe twice. I had a roommate that WFH and was unable to do his meetings in the living room because she would sleep in, so he had to do them in the bathroom. Even when her ex wasn't home, she would still stay at our place and we had no personal space at all.

During the time that Sam crashed on our couch, she kept pressuring me to go on this vacation with her and I kept declining because I was tight on money and she knew that. She continued to pressure me and I eventually gave in. On the vacation, she was in a bad mood constantly. It felt like I was walking on eggshells. There were many instances where she would walk ahead and pretend I'm not even there. Instead of enjoying the vacation, she kept trying to make Tik Toks together and hoped that her ""exes would see them"". She would blast her songs the entire trip and when I want to listen to my own songs, she tells me to turn it off. It honestly felt like she only made me go on this trip because she just wanted company. On our last night, she unplugged my phone from the charger while I was sleeping so she could use it. My phone ended up dying and there were no outlets to charge my phone at the airport. After our vacation, thankfully, her parents forced her to move out of my apartment.

Me and my roommate helped her move her things for five whole hours since she was too cheap to hire moving people. Right after arriving at her new apartment, she asked me to send her money back for the ubers we took on vacation, which was around $50. I asked her if she was serious, since I felt like the help I gave her was worth more than that. She became passive aggressive because she ""paid for food three times on vacation"" and I ""only paid for two"", which I thought was ridiculous. After that, I told her I didn't want to deal with her anymore and that she was ungrateful, she saw my messages and never replied. She made three times my salary and bought herself a $2000 necklace not too long ago, don't think she needed $50 after all I've done for her.

TLDR: i let best friend crash at my apartment for a month, go on a vacation that she pressured me to go on, helped her move her things for 5 hours, and she asked me to pay her back for $50 in ubers, and I didn’t want to pay her back.

We both work at the same place, which is a large university. He applied for a promotion, and received it. The problem is that if he takes this job, he would be responsible for overseeing the department where I work. He wouldn't be my direct supervisor, but a couple levels up. I wouldn't be working with him directly.



When he applied, he told me that this wouldn't be a problem. Apparently, he was told that I could keep my job, but just report to someone else so I'm not in his direct chain of command. But after he got the job, we were told that this isn't possible and he can't take the job until I quit.  Apparently it is a rule in the employee handbook (government university so there are a lot of rules) that hasn't really been enforced that well until recently. 



For context, I currently make about 45k a year. In his current position, he makes 125k, and the new position would be about 145k. He says that I don't even have to work anymore because we don't need that much money (we are in LCOL area, house paid off, and no kids). But to me, it's not about the money. I attended this university and worked in this department part time when I was a student, and then started full time as soon as I graduated. I have been working with some of my coworkers longer than I've known my husband. I don't want to give it all up just so he can get a promotion, as I would probably be bored sitting at home. He did mention that I can easily get another similar job in a different department on campus (our university is expanding and these types of jobs are a dime a dozen), but again, I don't want to make such a big change and there's no guarantee I would get along with my new coworkers and enjoy my work like I currently do.

I don't like going alone, I love having a partner, but my best friend got deployed so for a while, I have been going by myself. I was able to talk my girlfriend into it. 

I was able to convince her it would be really good bonding and would help us build our bodies to be healthier together. I bought her some gym clothes she really liked, got a year long guest pass for my gym and was excited to go with her

We went together for about a month before she gave up.

So now at this point, I was in the hole already, I couldn't refunded for the pass, and I figured it would be more hassle than it's worth to try to return anything i bought. So I put all the clothes I bought her in a gym bag and gave them to my friend. 

I asked her if she wanted to start going to the gym with me and she agreed, now we've been going strong for about a month and she loves it and has no intention of stopping.

When my girlfriend found out I asked her and gave her the clothes she wasn't wearing she was beyond pissed. I was able to get her the clothes back (they were too baggy for my friend so I just got them back and told my gf she could keep them for whatever). 

She told me it wasn't right for me to give the things I bought for her to someone else. I told her I bought clothes for working out and it made no sense for them to just collect dust in the drawer so I gave them to someone who would use them. 

She is also incredibly pissed that I now spend like 2 hours every night with my friend, which I don't think is fair because I literally begged her to go with me.

Chad messaged John, asking whether I took offense to his jokes. John tried to mediate, suggesting I wait to address it.

A few days later I messaged Chad directly, expressing my concern and disapproval of his attitude. He responded dismissively, accusing me of ""projecting"" and ""undermining"" his family. He then blocked me.

Let me start by saying that this place is kept pretty damn clean all things considered; there's never clutter or belongings left out in the 'communal space' (kitchen, living room, bathrooms). However this person aparently doesn't see things that way.

She gets mad whenever there are any crumbs/dust on the ground, even if it's barely noticeable, and leaves sticky notes around barking at us to sweep up. Granted this place is kept swept up by everyone, I know at least I make an effort to do so. But aparently even the smallest amount of debris is enough to set her off.

She leaves the front door wide open during the middle of the night because ""it stinks in here"" and to cool off the dorm.

Most recently, she got mad that one of us used her sponge to wash dishes; keep in mind that she didn't label these Sponges, mention it beforehand, and just left it in the sink alongside all the other Sponges. 

This ticked her off so much that she called the RA (basically camp counselor for dorms) to try and resolve the ""issue"", and scheduled a group meeting at the end of the day, during a time I had classes so as you may guess, I missed it. 

I consider myself a pretty chill guy but I'm honestly really starting to hate this person and their borderline OCD behavior.

Edit for more context: 
These two guys have been my friends for 8+ years. They regularly communicate with me outside of my husband. These aren’t random people I don’t really know. 

Text thread for context:

My text to husband and two friends:
Avi can’t have people over every day. It’s just disrupting my peace. We will host a boys night once a week where I will provide pizza and drinks other than that if y’all are going to hang out, it’s not gonna be here.

Husband’s friend leaves the conversation.

I add My Husband’s friend back to the conversation.

My text two husband and two friends:
That’s disrespectful as fuck now you’re not coming over here at all

My Husband’s friend’s text to me:
On my dead (racially explicit) i dont give a fuck wtf 

Stop talking to me like a little ass boy idk who you think you are.. you are Avi’s WIFE not my fucking mom I’ve been over there 3 times outta five months you talking bout coming over everyday you obviously not talking to me cause i never came over there everyday talk to somebody else like a kid 


Now that I have the context out-of-the-way, my husband’s friends have been coming over most days for the past month and a half. When I say most days, I don’t mean 15 out of 30, I mean closer to 25 out of 30. They eat all my food, leave trash out after I’ve cleaned, have let my dogs run away multiple times, leave trash in my yard, smoke weed in my car, mess with my workstation set up where I work from home to play on my Xbox , and ignore me when I speak to them.

My Husband did not respond positively to the feedback that I gave regarding having his friends come over less often or picking another place to hang out. I decided to take it upon myself to send a message to him and his friends setting a boundary for my home. We have a five year-old daughter and they are often over here late into the night on school nights.

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA for telling my husband’s friends they can’t come over as often AITA (24F) for telling my husband’s (25M) friends (26M & 27M) they can’t come over as often. 


Edit for more context: 
These two guys have been my friends for 8+ years. They regularly communicate with me outside of my husband. These aren’t random people I don’t really know. 

Text thread for context:

My text to husband and two friends:
Avi can’t have people over every day. It’s just disrupting my peace. We will host a boys night once a week where I will provide pizza and drinks other than that if y’all are going to hang out, it’s not gonna be here.

Husband’s friend leaves the conversation.

I add My Husband’s friend back to the conversation.

My text two husband and two friends:
That’s disrespectful as fuck now you’re not coming over here at all

My Husband’s friend’s text to me:
On my dead (racially explicit) i dont give a fuck wtf 

Stop talking to me like a little ass boy idk who you think you are.. you are Avi’s WIFE not my fucking mom I’ve been over there 3 times outta five months you talking bout coming over everyday you obviously not talking to me cause i never came over there everyday talk to somebody else like a kid 


Now that I have the context out-of-the-way, my husband’s friends have been coming over most days for the past month and a half. When I say most days, I don’t mean 15 out of 30, I mean closer to 25 out of 30. They eat all my food, leave trash out after I’ve cleaned, have let my dogs run away multiple times, leave trash in my yard, smoke weed in my car, mess with my workstation set up where I work from home to play on my Xbox , and ignore me when I speak to them.

My Husband did not respond positively to the feedback that I gave regarding having his friends come over less often or picking another place to hang out. I decided to take it upon myself to send a message to him and his friends setting a boundary for my home. We have a five year-old daughter and they are often over here late into the night on school nights. My Husband did not defend me when his friends spoke to me that way instead he reacted with an iMessage ha ha to the texts. He then proceeded to text them separately to ignore me and leave the chat.

So during the summer i decided to switch schools for my senior year because i was getting harassed (food thrown at me or in my locker) and hated by my grade (except for my friends) because of ""he said, she said"" type of situation, basically rumours flying around about me. So in September at the start of the school year i was informed that the bus i would take from my school would drop us off at my old school where we would wait OUTSIDE until our transferring bus (that would take us home) would come get us and the same goes for the mornings just in reverse. The thought of having to see the people who made my junior year a living hell is terrifying to me to the point i cry about it. Luckily i found a solution to my problem, i asked my friend that lives a couple roads down to come pick me up and bring me to school and drop me back at home since our schools are near each other and he has his license. I offered to pay him 20$ every week and he kindly agreed to do this for me after i told him about my severe stress over this bus transfer. This morning (monday) i send him the 20$ and wait for him to pick me up, normally he comes at around 8h25am but he wasn't here even after 8h45am, i called and texted but got no response and had to beg my mom to go bring me over there.

111,1g5dqm6,AITA for letting my wife leave the house angry?,"I'm 24M and my wife is 24F, throwaway account because she knows my main account.

My wife is 33 weeks pregnant, she's been dealing with the pregnancy like a champ and I've been helping her through it to the best of my abilities. Recently it came to light that not everything's been as fine and dandy as I thought, she broke down in tears a few days ago and mentioned that she's been feeling holed up and stuck at home; she has a bachelor's in graphic design and, before getting pregnant (it was an unexpected pregnancy) had planned to try for a masters and travel around the states. 

For context, my wife and I haven't been together for long, we just got married 3 months ago, and knew each other for only about a year before that, we got married because we both thought it'd be best for the baby (I'm active duty in the army, tri care, paid housing and all those benefits). 

She recently broke down in tears and said that she felt stuck, like her life is no longer hers and she can no longer do what she really wants to. I tried to reassure her and tell her that it ain't true, but she wouldn't listen to me. Because of work I had to go away from home for a month, I kept in contact as often as I could and all seemed to start going back to normal.

A few weeks ago an old friend from college came to visit my wife and they hung around all day while I stayed home. Everything seemed to be getting better, she started getting back to her bubbly self and I thought all was well, or so I thought. Today after I got back from work I noticed she was acting gloomy, so I asked what was wrong. All my attempts to figure out the issue were met with indifferent answers. At some point I got tired of prying and left her to be, at which point she broke down in tears again and told me she felt maiwrable at home and that the day she spent with her friend was the happiest she has been in months. I attempted to comfort her but she just pushed me away, so I just left her to cry it out and sat by her side.

After a while of silence she got up and made her way towards the door. Now, here's where I think I fucked up. At this point, I was tired. Ever since the pregnancy I stopped worrying about myself and focused solely on her, I ignored myself and my needs because I thought that anything I felt or needed couldn't compare to what she needed during the pregnancy. But today I felt like I had enough, my pent up emotions got the best of me and I just told her to be safe when she opened the door. 

She looked at me sort of disappointed and left. I have her location and she has mine, so I'm not too worried about where she went, but I just feel terrible about not getting up to stop her.

Edit: Thank ya'll for the input and words of encouragement. My wife returned home about half n hour ago, I took some of ya'lls advice and we agreed to sit down and talk honestly tomorrow.

Just to clarify some things:
1- We do have a set plan for her studies, the army offer tuition assistance for service members and spouses, and since I don't plan on going to college I told her she could use the tuition assistance to cover the cost/partial cost of her masters tuition.
2- We've discussed daycare and nannies, we both agreed with going through the family route. I have  big family pretty close to where I'm stationed, so finding someone to cover in as  nanny wasn't too hard.
3- I'm only reenlisting once, and taking advantage of the army's need for retention I'll op to stay in the same area, as to allow my wife to get accostumed to whichever college she decides to attend (we haven't looked into  colleges / universities in the area, yet)
4- We both agreed we wanted to have the baby. After discussing what we would do and how we would proceed, we both agreed we would go through with the pregnancy.
5- I've tried as much as I could to take her out and have fun, but due to the Army being random with its scheduling I haven't had much luck in that department, it also doesn't help that my wife is socially awkward.

112,1g5dhe5,AITA for asking my friend to not be on her phone when we hang out?,"So, I (39F) was dating Allison (35F, not real name) for a few years, and we just didn’t work out as romantic partners. The more I looked back, it was emotionally unfulfilling for me - no physical or emotional affection. (I’m asexual, and she told me she was demisexual when we started dating, but she never told me she was touch averse at all at any point in our relationship.)

Things were tense after our breakup, but we actually managed to rebuild our relationship as friends, and we’ve been friends for years now. I do genuinely care about her, but I’ve been frustrated for a while. When she comes over to hang out, she’s basically on my couch on her phone. 

She never gives me any indication of anything she wants to watch, so I usually end up showing her things I’ve found on youtube or whatever during the time we haven’t seen each other. Most of the time, it’s like I’m talking to myself, and it does my head in. A couple weeks ago, I sent her a text saying basically “Hey, new rule - you need to at least *try* and get off your phone and engage with me a little. It’s really hard for me to compete with your attention.” 

She sent me back a text telling me she had no interest in watching whatever ADHD dump I wanted to show her, and how hypocritical it was that I did needlepoint while she was over. 

(Additional information: We’re both on the autistic spectrum, and I have ADHD. Needlepoint is one of the things I do when I’m stimming, especially when it’s not something I need to give my full focus to. I’m more than capable of having a conversation while I do it.) 

Her being on her phone is something she’s been doing since we were dating, and I’ve asked her not to do it more than once over the many years we’ve known each other. Being ignored like that makes me incredibly anxious, and my brain goes into “oh god we have to be interesting. dance, fat girl, dance!” mode. (It’s especially frustrating if I’m cooking dinner and she doesn’t offer to help at all.)

I absolutely accept that this could be an “everybody sucks here” (or “everybody’s autistic here” lol) but we haven’t talked in a couple weeks and I’m not even sure if I should message her or just let the ball stay in her court.

Recently I had someone on my linkedin who I am close with who works for the company Varonis who reached out to me about a SOC Analyst job that is paying about the same price I am getting right now where the shift would be 9am-9pm Sunday through Wednesday.

While I am not really fond of the schedule it’s more in line with what I am wanting to do. I have been at my current job as a System Administrator for almost 2 years now. I’ve been told recently that I may not ever get promoted if I stay there as well as they demoted me from a security administrator to a system administrator.

With this new position however my gf is not on board with me taking this job. Brought up a couple of different concerns that were valid such as the schedule, not being able to work from home, what if they fire me 6 months after I am there, what if I can’t have the same amount of PTO.

She also brought up how I have hopped jobs for a bit of my career before this one where I would stay mainly 6 months to a year at them. My first IT job was at cisco where I got laid off due to covid. But other jobs I did hop as I was getting offered better benefits everytime and higher pay and I know quite a few of IT people who did this same thing with a few of their first IT jobs.

I said these are concerns and that I do get her concerns but this would be a great opportunity for me if I did get it as it would be my way into cybersecurity finally where I would be able to finally  get into the cybersecurity field as a full on SOC Analyst.

It broke out into this argument however where she said some things to me and I said some things to her. She was constantly interrupting me when I try to speak and I hate it when people do that and I was doing the same thing to her.

I’ve been with my gf (28F) for around 1.5years, who just finished school and has been working as a dancer in a club as well as working with a private charter company off and on. 

I loaned my gf about $5k to help put her through school since she could not afford it and allowed her to work when she could, while also living at my house completely free. She graduated from school around 4 months ago and has only applied to one or two jobs. She has been working maybe 2-3 days per week, if that.

She was working at the charter company when I met her, but I gave her permission to start working as a dancer again while in school because she said she brings in a lot of money.
I am getting frustrated because I pay for the majority of dates we go on, always have to pay more during travel plans, expected to pay for a weekly dinner date night for both of us, etc, while also having her still owe me around $4k of the $5k I originally loaned her for school. Basically picking up her slack financially for things we’d like to do. My solution in the past has just been to stop spending money like this, but she sees it as me not valuing her.

She has told me dancing takes a toll on her body because it requires a lot of upper body strength so can’t work everyday, which I understand and her other job is inconsistent with how much they need her. She is pretty adamant about not working a job that makes below a certain income.

Her last relationship was over 3 years and it was awful. It was horrible watching her be in a constant state of stress and pain, but still stay. This new relationship is really no different. Her boyfriends will treat her like garbage (not saying she’s an angel herself, she definitely instigates fights and is toxic as well), she will run to me ranting and raving and crying. I defend her as my sister, lift her up, give her as much support and words of affirmation as I can. And within a few days, she’ll be back with him. And I’m forced to be kind to these men that are awful to her. She’ll get defensive if I bad mouth them when she’s not angry at them.

She will stay for YEARS, running to me every few months crying or fuming about something objectively horrible her boyfriend has done. I have put up with it this entire time. Her last relationship was over 3 years and it was awful. It was horrible watching her be in a constant state of stress and pain, but still stay. This new relationship is really no different. Her boyfriends will treat her like garbage (not saying she’s an angel herself, she definitely instigates fights and is toxic as well), she will run to me ranting and raving and crying. I defend her as my sister, lift her up, give her as much support and words of affirmation as I can. And within a few days, she’ll be back with him. And I’m forced to be kind to these men that are awful to her. She’ll get defensive if I bad mouth them when she’s not angry at them. I’ve been dragged into her fights before where I’m toe-to-toe with her boyfriend defending her, and then she’ll get right back with them and I have to grin and bear the awkwardness that just a week ago I chewed his ass out. I have to pretend like I don’t hate him and the shitty things he’s done. 

I’ve just had it. I am so so so tired of the constant up and down rollercoaster and being her shoulder to cry on or rant to. I love her, she’s my big sister. I want to be there for her. But I’m so tired of being dragged in, standing up for her, then she’ll backtrack. Would it be wrong of me to tell her I don’t want to hear it anymore?

117,1g5ceup,AITA for leaving my work out early with my husband to hang with a friend,"My husband (m31) and I (m28) just started working out together again. He's been working out alone for over a year, but stopped for a few months due to work and is now getting back into it. I have been out of practice on weightlifting for... a while... And he's really good, so I asked him if I could go with him and we could work out together under the condition that he doesn't micromanage my routine. 

We are a few weeks or so in. I'm pretty flakey, but getting better over the weeks at my pace. I have to wait for him bc he is the member to the gym we go to, so I can't go in without him. He gets off an hr before me, but traffic is terrible and sometimes he takes a VERY long time to get across town to our gym. 

Anyway, a friend reached out to ask if we had anything going on tonight and if she can come over. Husband says he has leg day at the gym. I ask her what time she'll be available, and she tells me she's gotta drive home from her work, change, and then she could come over. I figure that I can get in a quick leg work out (assuming that husband is already at the gym which he usually is) and head home without her having to wait around too long. When I arrive at the gym, he isn't there. So I call and he says he is on the way, but traffic is particularly bad. 

I tell him that's okay, I'll probably just do a shorter work out and then head home early. He gets very confused by this, and then confusion turns into frustration because he wants to hang out with us too. I tell him that he can come home early too if he wants to, but that I just really would like to prioritize my time with my friend. I would have liked to do both, but since husband was stuck in traffic and I don't have much time, I'll just make it shorter. He says well I don't want to miss time with our friend either. 

And I tell him he can come home early too if he wants! I don't care. That's up to him. This upsets him bc he is trying to prioritize exercising. So I tell him, well, if I don't go, then we both end up missing out on hanging out with our friend. I don't really see the issue? (I assume he feels unsupported in his exercise goals?) 

He gets very short with me on the phone and basically just hangs up. 

Please help. I don't necessarily want to rag on him and I will talk to him about it later, but I'm very confused about what I did to upset him? Should I stay at the gym instead of seeing my friend?

119,1g5bncp,AITA for pulling my daughter from of a disorganized school field trip? ,"A couple months ago, I (31f)signed up my daughter (8f) for an after-school field trip through her school’s after-school program. She is not normally in the after school program, it was a field trip they were offering to all students. They said the trip would last until 6 p.m., and there were “limited spots available.” I never received an email or phone call to confirm she is able to go.

This morning, after sending her off to school, I realized it was the day of the field trip. When I called the school to confirm her attendance, they informed me they didn’t have a list of students going on the trip because it was organized by the school district, not the school itself. The office staff said parents had been calIing them all day about it and they didn’t have any information. I also realized the date coincided with a minimum day, meaning the kids normally get out at 1:25 p.m. This left me feeling uneasy.

I drove to the school to get clarification and found my daughter in the cafeteria waiting for the bus. She was excited, but I still felt uncertain about whether she should go. While I was there, a staff member approached me and said parents weren’t supposed to be in the cafeteria and asked me to leave.

I then asked if food would be provided for the kids since the trip lasted until 6 p.m. They said they only received a small snack. To make matters worse, I learned that the buses wouldn’t be arriving until 3:30 p.m., meaning all those kids would be waiting in the cafeteria for over two hours. They offered that I could take her home but would have to return at 3:30 when the bus arrives which didn’t work for my schedule.

Feeling frustrated, I confronted the staff about how disorganized everything seemed and expressed that I didn’t feel comfortable sending my daughter with them. I sounded really mad. I ended up leaving with my daughter and she was crying 😣

To make it up to her, I told her I would take her to the location of the field trip on our own time and bring friends with us.

Yes, it's true that we made a small meal train to help us get through this week. That's the only help we asked for. Not a dime, just some comfort meals and prayers.

We went back and forth a bit. She then went on this rant about how she never asked for help when her house flooded... as if that's at all comparable to my husband starting cancer treatment.

I told her to consider a different career path and to remove herself from our lives. She said I was an AH for responding that way to her ""sharing her concerns.""

122,1g5asw1,AITA if I sue the person who hit my car? ,"Two months ago I (20f) was at work (at a decently popular fast food shop for the town I’m in), and a high schooler came through with the Friday night crowd. He had a truck and struggled to park. He ended up slamming into my cars front bumper, and hitting my wheel (I had parked in a rush, so my tires stuck out at the side).  He got scared and drove off, but some of his friends stayed and informed both me and the police. 

I got in contact with his father and he wanted to settle outside of insurance. I said fine, as long as I get paid and my car is fixed. After a few days he stopped cooperating, so I took it to his insurance company, who is also my insurance company. They have been less than cooperative. 

They insisted my car was totaled (damages ~40% of the cars worth) which was untrue, especially for the state I’m in. (WI)

After this they tried to argue my car was undamaged, which I proved otherwise. 

They said it was actually ME who hit his truck, to which I proved was untrue. 

They said I was scamming them for money. Again untrue, I just want my car fixed. 

They said his limits were too low to fix it (limits ~1900$?). 

He hit my tire in the initial crash, and immediately after my car drove funnily. I had to pay a few days later to fix the alignment, but now they argue he never hit that part of my car even though it said so in the police report. 

I said if they could not cooperate with me I would just have to sue him in small claims court. The adjuster was very angry and said I was going to ruin some kids life over a bumper, but it wouldn’t be the kid paying for it. 

Ive tried so many ways to work this out outside of court. I offered to settle outside of insurance, that did not work. I tried to go through insurance, they said he had policy limit issues, so I said I would try to cover what he couldn’t if they said how much he could cover. They refused, he called me and said “fuck you, sue me”.

I still tried to just settle with the insurance company. They wouldn’t let me because he refused to settle!! 

I can’t file this under my policy because I cannot afford the rate raise, and if I have another accident on my record I risk being dropped. 

I’ve spoken to the Insurance commissioners office for my state and they said once this is concluded they would be interested in speaking with my insurance company as it seems the other party is lacking in proper insurance. (Minimum amount for my state is 10k). 

I understand this sounds completely insane, and it is. I’m at the point of just suing him (minor and father) because they’ve been uncooperative and rude through the entire process, and that looks like the literal only way to get my car fixed. 

I’m just so done with this and tired of fighting it. 

So AITA if I sue the person who hit my car?

EDIT: when I say “they said ….. “ I mean the adjuster/insurance company has said this.

124,1g5a950,AITA for not inviting my parents to my wedding? ,"
So me (23f) and my fiancé (23m) are getting married in a year. We are paying for the entire things ourselves because my parents paid for the small portion of college that my scholarships didn’t pay for. 
For some context, I make just under 300k a year and my fiance makes about 100k. 
Because we’re paying for the wedding together, my fiance and I combined finances immediately. 
So I don’t consider it to be my income or his income. It’s purely OUR income. Completely joint finances. This was important to both of us to do and we talked about it at length before doing it. He is comfortable with the fact that I make more right now and it helps us afford OUR lifestyle choices together. 

So anyway, we’re planning our wedding and my parents have some strong opinions. I agree with some of them but I know my fiance does not so I always shut them down. 
Things like a massive guest count or an open bar or other expensive options sound fun but aren’t all that critical to me. Those expenses are big NOs from the fiance though due to the money or it. 

My parents are saying that I should just do all of these things and pay for them myself without telling him because he wouldn’t even notice by the time the big day comes around. 
I obviously told them no and that it was disrespectful to my fiance bc it’s our money. Not mine. 
And they keep going on about the fact that he doesn’t make as much as me and that he shouldn’t get opinions. Now we haven’t talked in like 2 weeks

125,1g5a6ps,AITA for invalidating my coworker's memory issues?,"I (27F) work full time at a college library. I have worked here since 2018, besides lockdown, and in this position for 7 months. We hire student workers to do smaller tasks (mostly working the circulation desk) and their financial aide pays them for the hours. My coworker (21F) just started working as one in September. I help interview them but that is the most of my ""official"" involvement- and she interviewed amazingly.

I am not her supervisor, her supervisor is my other coworker (35F) who shares a job title and office with me. When she isn't here, I'm the go-to for helping out and questions since as a specialist, her and I work in all areas of the job. Said supervisor is on leave for personal reasons for about 2 weeks now.

She routinely cannot perform the job functions, however. She almost never asks for help with them, either. I have to overhear her actively making a mistake to step in and solve it or she'll never tell me. This is hard as I have non-circ desk work to be done that I have to cram on days she isn't here since at this point I have to be out there for this reason. It's also difficult as I'm partially deaf. She also will not answer the phone- one thing I have an official accomodation to not do except in emergencies / nobody else there. 

Today I stepped in on her making a mistake that could have cost us a couple hundred dollars in materials. After the student left and nobody else was around, I told her that if she needed help with anything she's unsure of, the best thing to do is ask me. I also asked if she wanted any reminders on our phone procedures. She stared blankly at me without responding to either thing and went back to her seat. 

The next day my boss took me aside and said she had formally complained about me invalidating her issues with her ADHD memory problems. I know everyone's different but since the reason I'm hard of hearing is a TBI that also impacts my memory function (my desk is full of sticky notes of procedural reminders for myself). 

I don't disbelieve she has memory issues but I don't believe it's what came into play? I explained it to my boss and she understood my side but since it pertains to disability it has to go to HR now against me. 

I might be the AH, because she's younger with less work experience than me, and a condition that makes her tasks hard and I'm not her supervisor to have stepped in like that- it may have come across as rude, overstepping, and invalidating.

126,1g59ybp,AITAH for not letting my boyfriend drive my car ,"I’m 25F my boyfriend is 27M. We have been dating for 2 yrs. My boyfriend’s car recently broke down, it had prev problems but he couldn’t afford to fix them. I let him borrow my car for a week while he was looking for a new car. He couldn’t get a loan on his own due to bad credit so he got his dad to cosign, however the dealership said that they had to live together for them to cosign a week later, no car… I explained to him that I would not be comfortable with him continuing using my car because it gives me anxiety. The financial burden falls on me. He's not in the position to be able to buy me a new car or fix my car. He understood this and got an electrical bike. problem solved however he used my car one other time which I allowed, to drive to his dad‘s who lives about 30 mins away to clean the car out to sell to caravans. It is currently in his dad’s garage. Now a week later, he needs to go back over because his dad told he doesn’t want it in his garage. He has to help his dad tow the car to the street. I said this time I would help him and drive him out there but I let him know I don’t want this to be a constant thing.
Now his dad is wanting to invite us over for dinner and to watch a football game that same day. I don’t really want to be over at someone else’s house watching sports. I want to go home and relax! Bf said it was fine but he expressed he would like to go to dinner with his family  once a month & he’d like me to go with. We have a sort of rocky relationship. We lived with his dad for 9 months & quickly left because his dad would constantly criticize me for being shy and not wanting to be out in the living room socializing 24/7. I paid rent & he ended up blowing up at me & screaming in my face. I moved out with my boyfriend. Although we’ve gotten past it. I get instant anxiety and feel uncomfortable around him. I try my best when I go over to smile and have conversation as if nothing ever happened to get past it. There are times I enjoy being around his dad but It’s like walking on eggshells… anything I do might offend him. Anyways, I told my boyfriend that he is more than welcome to go out there, but I won’t be going every single time unless I’m up for it. My boyfriend seems to understand this, but also said what worries him is his dad saying “I haven’t seen (me) in a while” ect. I let him know. I find that a little annoying because we are adults and no one owes anyone anything. I still don’t want him driving my car. Of course I feel bad, it’s not like I don’t wanna help  at the same time I’m realistic and know that if shit goes down, I’m the only one that’s gonna be able to do anything about it. He can ask his dad to come pick him up or get an Uber right?!
Am I the A hole for not wanting to let him borrow my car to see his dad and not wanting to go over every single month to his dads?

127,1g59u2w,AITA for not taking the blame when my mom told my boyfriend I was dressed immodestly?,"

So I (17f) had my boyfriend (lets call him Jack) over to my house a while ago, and I was wearing a belted dress that came a little more than halfway down my thigh with leggings. We were hanging out, and I didn't think anything of it until my mom got home. I was sitting in the living room with Jack, and my mom was in the adjacent kitchen. I noticed she kept giving me weird looks, but I didn't know why. I went to get Jack a drink of water, and when I went into the kitchen, my mom started whispering/hissing at me that I was dressed immodestly and to go change my dress.

For context, my mom is very conservative, and I'm also not allowed to wear leggings, tighter jeans or shirts, or tanktops. Admittedly, my dress was a bit short, but since it was with leggings I didn't think it was a huge deal. I said I would change, and went back to the living room to give Jack his drink. He had seen my mom whispering at me, so I sat down for maybe thirty seconds to a minute just to try and make it look a little less weird and then went and fixed my dress so it was longer.

When I came back down, Jack had gone into the kitchen with my mom. I walked into the room, and almost immediately, my mom started making comments to Jack about how my dress was ""very immodest"" and ""a good five inches too short."" All the while, both of them were staring at my legs and dress. It was humiliating, but I tried to laugh it off until later when Jack left. I told my mom that she should never have said that and drawn attention to my body in that way, especially in front of my boyfriend. I don't think he had even noticed that my dress was different. She said that she only said it so he would understand why I went upstairs because he looked confused. She said that if I didn't want her to say anything, I shouldn't have worn that dress.

128,1g59idq,AITA for not trusting my boyfriend’s mother with his child?,"This story begins before the child was born. I (20yo female) met my boyfriend (22yo male) while his ex was 7 months pregnant. He came to my house with a few mutual friends and we hit it off immediately, he told me everything about his situation that night. Basically, I had two months to decide whether I was ready to be a stepmom, but since I was already at the point that I wanted to settle down I wasn't against the idea.
After my stepson was born, my boyfriend and I were only allowed to see him if it was at his ex's house or his mothers house per agreement between the ex and his mother. When the child was 4 months old, after begging my boyfriends ex, we began having him over at our house Monday-Thursday. That only lasted 2 months, because one day my boyfriends mother showed up to visit, she came to the house around 8pm with is the child's bedtime. My boyfriend had put him down to sleep and at the time we were just starting to get into using the ""cry it out"" method (that is when you lay your sleepy child down in their crib and let them cry until they eventually fall asleep, promoting self soothing). Well, I guess my boyfriends mother had never heard of that because she began screaming at him saying that he was neglecting his child and that she was going to call CPS on us for torturing him. The next day, my boyfriend's ex showed up at our house with the police and ended visits all together. She told him that he would only see his child again if he apologized to his mother and worked things out.
For the next 4 months I began documenting everything I could find. I helped my boyfriend fight in court to win partial physical and legal custody despite not being allowed to sign for paternity at birth. I am not going to get into details about the case but the copious amount of evidence that I had put together ON MY OWN (with no lawyer) was sufficient enough to give us custody with no legal proof of him being the father. On the day of the court case, my boyfriends mother showed up to support his ex, although she knows just as much as we do about their living situation and how it is not fit for a child (drug use, poor hygiene etc).
Now, the child is a year old and we've started to finally be able to see him consistently. As soon as the custody schedule began, my boyfriend's mother began asking to have him over night on the days that we are supposed to have him. We told her that she chose to support his ex, so she can try to set up visits for when she has him. 
As a response to this, she filed for emergency custody claiming that we blow smoke in the child's face. We found out about this case on my boyfriends birthday and had a conversation with her, we explained that because she lied and because I have a recording of her stating that we are more than fit to take care of a child just a week prior that she will not win and we will all be losing money for nothing, we did also come to an agreement to allow her to see the child more and acknowledged that the issue really shouldn't effect his relationship with his grandmother. 
Today, we agreed to let her take him for 3 hours. When she pulled into the drive way I handed him to her along with his coat. As soon as she got him in the car she tried to put his coat on and I told her not to, I explained that it's not safe for a kid to have a coat on in their car seat because it makes the shoulder straps too loose. Then, as she was putting him in the car seat I noticed that he was sitting way too far forward so I let her know that it needed to be fixed to which she replied ""he's fine"". I corrected her again and told her that it was unsafe and needed to be fixed. She did fix the car seat but after she left she called my boyfriend saying that I was disrespectful and that I need to just trust her because she was a mom before.

129,1g59bh2,WIBTA if I accept an all paid holiday to Dubai?,"So, my brother just offered me to join him and his family for a few days to Dubai. 

Thing is, the trip is next week and is extremely last minute.

2. One of my close friends is having a birthday party and ill be missing it.

Just a little context, I recently quit my job and gave up on renewing my visa. I've been going through a lot of health issues and also been struggling mentally due to numerous traumatic incidents that happened comsequentively. I live in the same country as my brother and it was a hard realisation to come to that I'm moving out of the country soon and with everything I've been going through my brother talked with his wife and had the idea of including me in their family vacation very last minute to clear my head and have a break with them fully paid for. 

My first thought were the two commitments I have but at the same time it would be so freaking amazing to go on holiday right now. I didn't want to decide until I spoke with my friends and sort things out and also see how I feel.

I messaged my friend immediately who’s having a birthday party and she was extremely pissed at me and said I'll have more opportunities to go.

My first thought were the two commitments I have but at the same time it would be so freaking amazing to go on holiday right now. I didn't want to decide until I spoke with my friends and sort things out and also see how I feel.

I messaged my friend immediately who’s having a birthday party and she was extremely pissed at me and said I'll have more opportunities to go. 

I feel horrible and I don't know what to do. I don’t want to upset anyone and I know my brother is coming from a good place to offer me this.

130,1g591ng,AITA for not offering to pay for my wife's car?,"I 34M live with my 30F wife. No kids and we both are fortunate to make good money in our jobs, both well above average and have lots of disposable income every month after paying bills. We contribute towards bills in a joint account based on our salaries, which is currently a 60/40 split. Everything left over after paying into the joint account is ours to do with what we want.

I'm generally a saver and am careful with my spending, whereas she's a spender and goes through every penny of her disposable income every month (no significant monthly outgoings either). I also saved for and put down the entire deposit of the house when we took out the mortgage, and I then took out significant debt afterwards to pay for renovations she wanted which I paid off myself.

Initially when we moved in, I had to raise the question of financial arrangements, and my first suggestion was we could put both our salaries into a single pot and then take out a set amount of ""pocket money"" each month. She was very against it as it limited her freedom, which I understand so we agreed to pay bills only out of a joint account. We agreed the minimum of living costs plus groceries, everything outside of that we sort out of our disposable (e.g. car insurance or dentist etc.). Despite this I still pay for most of the household one-off costs where I see it needs doing, as I want her to have more disposable income to encourage her to save.

So anyway, she's been driving an old car for years, despite being able to afford a new one but was against taking them out on finance. However now she wants to get a new car on finance but has expressed disappointment in me as a husband for not offering to help pay for it. My response was ""why do I need to offer to help with it?"" given that I pay for my car on finance and we've already agreed car costs are not part of the financial arrangement. 

I know that comes across cold, but my point is about the fairness of the request. Given that she's earning good money (way more than I was when we moved in even), and is fully able to get herself a car, why is it my duty to ""help"" her when she is not in a position of need? I even asked her if she would do the same for me and she said no because ""this is something husbands do"". She's alluded to wanting parts of a traditional marriage, but for me it's not fair if she only wants the parts where she gains and none of the parts where she compromises.

To be clear, I'm fully on board with paying for her car if she wants it, just I would like to do it fairly and put my car payments as well with it. She's refusing to do that because, her words, ""this is something husbands do for their wives"" according to her values.

There's of course way more to this marriage but that broadly encapsulates this particular situation and the context around it. AITA for not agreeing to this?

132,1g58dbc,AITA reporting my mom’s address to a loan shark company?,"My mom stayed with me every now and then from July 2022-October 2023. Never more than two or three nights due to her having to work and my generally needing a break from her overbearing attitude (she was there to help after I had twins and needed the extra hands while my husband was at work). During that time she “came into some money” which I recently learned was because she went to a title loan company and used my late fathers car as collateral (which I still don’t see how it was done because the car was in probate at the time and her name wasn’t on the title but whatever). 

She moved halfway across the country in October 2023 and yesterday I had someone at my door looking for her. I asked who they were and why they needed her and they told me it was for missed payments on the title loan. I gave them her new number and address and closed the door. She started getting calls from them to make her pay up and she’s mad at me now. 

I never told her she could give them my address or use my address for anything. Not even to get a debit card sent to her because she somehow lost her PO Box. She said she can sue me for “violating privacy laws” since I gave them her information.

133,1g587ij,AITA for not inviting a friend to my hangout?,"First some context, since it is needed to understand the situation better.
Jessica is (16f, not her real name by the way) more an acquaintance than a friend, we hung out 3 times in total and that’s because of our mutual friend, who we’ll call Claire (17 f) for privacy reasons.
Me and Jessica sometimes talked because we were in the same class and just happened to be forced next to each other 7 hours per day, despite this I made it very clear that I was uncomfortable with it various times to her but she may have misread my usual politeness for wanting friendship.

The thing is: in that same class I have a group of friends whom I’m really close with, said group hates Jessica and viceversa Jessica hates them, this will be important later.

Me and this group decided to hangout and then sleepover at my house for Halloween, classic dinner, scary stories and staying up all night while watching horror movies, of course I did not invite Jessica nor told her about the hangout, not only because we were never that close to begin with but because bringing her in a room full of people she hates and that hate her would ruin it for everybody.

Fast forward to yesterday morning: Jessica wanted to hang out with Claire for Halloween too, Claire at first didn’t say much but then gave in and told her she (and the rest of the group) were gonna stay at my house for Halloween night.
Jessica got mad, like really mad, when I got to school she yelled at me, understandably so, I said sorry for not telling her and my reasoning for the fact that I won’t still invite her. 
We had some back and fourth and now she’s not talking to me, I mean, as much as I like the peace I really do feel sorry, she must have felt excluded and I could’ve just told her sooner.
However I’m not sure that if I told her it would’ve been different. AITA?

134,1g583do,AITA for the one time I did not say “excuse me” when trying to pass someone?,"This happened a while ago, and I know it’s super petty, but it’s been something nagging at me ever since it happened.

I was at Walmart. Was walking down one of the main isles to get to a register (so one of the BIGGEST aisles in the store). A woman was standing in the middle of the aisle with her cart. She was not waiting in any lines, she was just standing there. As I was approaching her, she made clear eye contact with me. I saw her reach for her cart, as if she was about to move it so I could pass, but then stopped. Me, seeing her actively notice that she was in my way and seeming to disregard me completely, annoyed me. There was just enough room to squeeze past her on the side where there was no traffic (and, yes, the store was busy). As I was squeezing past, a guy said “excuse me” while passing her on the other side. She then said, very loudly: “I want to know why *you* can say ‘excuse me’ but this person can’t.” I immediately turned around and glared at her, flabbergasted that she had the nerve to say that when she was *intentionally standing in the middle of the aisle and refusing to move.*

I almost always say “excuse me” in these situations. To me, “excuse me” is a way to let someone know you are needing to pass. Since this lady already saw that I was needing to pass her before I was close enough to say anything, and intentionally opted to not move, saying “excuse me” did not seem necessary (or, honestly, deserved). 

I probably wouldn’t have given it as much thought as I have, because it seemed obvious the woman was just being rude, but my SO was with me, and when I made a comment about the interaction, all he had to say about it was “I would’ve just said excuse me.” As if I was the problem. It made me wonder if I was being delusional. 

So, AITA for thinking that someone who is intentionally standing in my way doesn’t deserve my politeness?? Again, I know it’s super petty, but I want to put this stupid thing that’s been bugging me to rest. 

Edit: in case anyone else asks why something this small still bothers me: I honestly don’t know. I have general anxiety that is triggered in social interactions, and I have a lot of ptsd from social issues as a child, so that probably has something to do with it. But it’s honestly not that serious. Im just posting this out of curiosity and boredom. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-16,"AITA for the one time I did not say “excuse me” when trying to pass someone?
