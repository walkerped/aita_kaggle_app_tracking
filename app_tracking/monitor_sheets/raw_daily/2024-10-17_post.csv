0,1g5nfig,AITA for accidentally revealing to my trans friend's gf that her gf's trans,"So I have this friend called Mary. She's AMAB and has been struggling with her identity ever since she was young. Around a year ago she met this girl called Emma(fake names) and Emma knows Mary is hiding something and promised she'd wait for Mary to say it. Around a week ago we had a school festival and Mary and Emma were together walking around. I haven't met Emma before so I assumed she was a friend of Mary's. I saw her walking by herself an hour later so I approached her with my friends. We talked for a while and after finding out she's been friends with Mary for a while I stupidly asked ""Are you a boy too?"" as a joke. Emma was shocked and my friend told me to stop because it was obvious Emma didn't know. I kept going and called Mary by he/him pronouns and Emma looked disgusted by us and eventually pieced together what we meant. Mary was eavesdropping on us, the thing is she's been building up her courage to tell Emma her secret and thought Emma would be accepting, but that shattered all her hopes. Mary started getting a panic attack and ran away apologising for not telling Emma. Ever since that happened Mary has been isolating herself and cut off contact with everyone.

The bedrooms are very different in size and since they helped me move in I initially was ok with taking the smaller bedroom however I felt her and her bf kinda pressured me into it.

As I was trying to move my stuff in I noticed how difficult was to fit my stuff and decided to ask my roommate if they were willing to pay a little more in rent to have the bigger room and if that didn't work offered to take the bigger room and pay more.
They ignored me for a couple and days and then immediately started to move their stuff into the big room. I had to confront them for them to stop and talk about it and she said she'd pay a little upfront but that she didn't think it was fair to pay more every month. I was annoyed but ultimately agreed. Then things got worse. The bills (not rent) are in my name which is dumb I know but I knew her and she agreed to just Venmo me each month. It has been two months and she has not payed me back for any of the utilities or wifi. She avoids me when I try to talk to her in person and only will really have a conversation over text .

3,1g5yztt,AITA My friend wants to apply for the same job as me,"So I work in the public utility industry. And I recently was informed of a board member's retirement and told I should apply for the position. I am very excited because it is going to give me some invaluable experience and knowledge. Anyway, I was talking with my friend, who also works with me about the position. It comes with a small monthly stipend for serving on the board. Not necessarily money I need, but it's a bonus for me. I would still want the position if it didn't come with any extra money, because I want the experience for my resume.

Anyway this friend I was talking to about the position tells me that they are going to apply too, because they want the extra money. I said I was offended because I want it for resume building and the friend doesn't care about that aspect. This friend then told me they didn't care about my feelings and that I don't need the money so I shouldn't even apply. I got upset because I thought our friendship meant more. This friend and I spend time together with our children, and we have done a lot to help each other out in the past.

I withdrew from the conversation immediately and have had a hard time talking to them because of this since it happened. I feel like I might be overreacting, and I'm not sure what should be done.

I would like to add my friend would know nothing about this position if it wasn't for me talking with them about it because it is for a different organization and the manager for that organization told me about it personally. 

I have also done a lot to help my friend financially within the last year. For instance I support their small business by purchasing items from them personally and helping them source clients. I volunteer my time to help them with their inventory. And I helped this friend get hired for a job within my company. This friend is a single parent, so yes the money would be helpful to them, but it would not be life changing. It is about $200 a month. The position they work in is going to come with a $10/hour raise soon. I was also offered their position first as well, but I thought of my friend before myself because I knew they needed the money more than me.

Now this friend has a career and I am stuck in a dead end job and want experience and networking opportunities so I can find a career for myself.

I don't think I'm the AH here, but am I?

Update: thank you redditors for responding. I have read through the majority I think. And I am understanding that yes, I am childish, silly, and ultimately the asshole.

4,1g5yunm,AITA for telling my mom's husband my wedding isn't for him or about him?,"My parents divorced when I was really young. They were not a good couple. Really toxic with each other. I remember them near the end and it wasn't happy or positive. But they were both really amazing parents to me when not together. I was loved. I was safe with them both. They made sure I grew up into a good person and they made sure I knew toxic/not healthy relationships and how to avoid them.

My mom remarried when I was 9.

My dad never remarried and he died when I was 19.

I was never too close with my mom's husband. He adores my mom and she adores him and they're good together. But he always rubbed me the wrong way. I always felt like he expected to take on the role of ""primary dad"" because my parents marriage hadn't been good and he therefore believed it made my dad a less worthy parent. I also picked up on some misogynistic leanings he had. He had an issue with me playing video games. But his nephew (same age as me) it was no big deal. I was a kid in his care so people can argue that was different. But he wasn't totally against me playing somethin like The Sims. But a horror game? Or something more serious was a bigger deal in his eyes. My mom would always say it was fine, and I had a good head on my shoulders. But he judged my dad hard for playing video games with me.

By 13 I had told my mom I wanted to live with my dad more. Dad lived closer to my school and friends which made it easier. She supported it as long as I didn't forget about her, which I didn't. But a year later when she and her husband moved for jobs, he was more than a little offended that I didn't want to move with them. They had a pool at their new house and everything and he took it very personally that it wasn't enough to make me want to be with them. He never said a lot about it but he did make the comment that most teens would kill for a pool and there was always a vibe when I went to visit after that. 

He was also pissed I didn't call him when dad died.

Today I'm 27 and getting married in a month and my mom's husband has an issue with the fact he has no role in the wedding. Starting off; he is not paying or contributing any money to my wedding. He *is* sitting next to mom, in photos, at the family table, but he's not walking me down the aisle or anything. This was only increased when he found out I was wearing a photo of my dad on my wedding day. And that I was placing a small trinket of dad's on a chair next to him and my mom to represent him. He told me he doesn't like that dad has more of a presence and a representation than he does. I told him my wedding is not for or about him and he didn't need to like it. He told me he deserved better because he's been my ""second dad"" a hot minute. I said nothing else and he told me I could try being more respectful.

5,1g5ytq6,"AITA for ripping a shirt, in front of my Mom, that she just bought me?","I (16M) love my mom (46F). She’s a very nice and sweet lady and she goes out of her way for me and my brothers. However she takes it a bit too far.

One of the things she does is buy me clothes. Whenever she goes somewhere that isn’t Walmart or a grocery store she has a brand new shirt or new jeans. It’s very nice of her, but there’s 2 problems. A) The shirts she buys are very ugly. You know those shirts at JC penny that are just sitting on a random shelf, the ones with like a palm tree on them or something? That’s what she gets me. B) She’s been doing this for a few years. I am up to my asshole in new clothes. I have like 12 shirts I wear regularly, the rest still have the tags on them. Whenever she goes to the Salvation Army and I hand her all these clothes she complains about it. 

So I decided to bring this up with her and told her I appreciate the thought, but I do not want her to buy me clothes anymore. She said ok. But she still buys me clothes all the time. At first I begrudgingly accepted them and told her to stop. Then I began to refuse the shirts and told her to return them. She returns them, but still buys clothes. She has even started to complain about how much she has to return shirts now. Anyway, it kept going and I kept getting louder about it, making it clear I do NOT want her to buy me clothes anymore.

I reached a boiling point and decided I wasn’t going to be polite about it anymore. I told her flat out the next time she buys me new clothes, I’m either throwing them away or ripping it, because apparently asking her “No” is not enough. Again, she just said “Ok I’ll stop.” Well, you can probably guess what happened next. She came back from the store and the first thing she said to me was “I know you told me to stop buying you clothes, but…” and pulled out another ugly shirt. I took it, put my foot in the neck hole and ripped the thing down the middle. I just handed it back to her and walked off.

She’s been pretty upset about it and has actually been crying about it. We haven’t talked since (it’s been a day and a half) and we’ve been kind of avoiding each other. My brothers get where I’m coming from but think I took it a step too far. My Dad is on the fence about it, I’ve talked to him about this before and he agrees with me but I also don’t think he wants to take my side on a subject she’s this distraught about. I feel rotten about it, but at the same time I’ve asked her for months to stop, and I was pretty patient about up until like 3 weeks ago and I didn’t know what else to do.

Don’t twist this, I love my Mom and recognize how much she cares for me. I want to apologize but I feel like if I do this problem will persist. I know it’s a nice gesture but she also knows how much it annoys me and still she does it.

If this was the only issue this would be a none issue, however i offered to take them back MULTIPLE times- i have the resources and the time and the want to care for them and she threatened to call the RSPCA because ‘8 cats is too many for anyone’- but my situation changed and i can no longer take the kittens back bc my last cat wouldn’t like them as she doesn’t like male cats, so she called me a dick for not being understanding of her situation (i would be more understanding if she actually let me help her months ago when i first offered).

7,1g5yakw,AITA for flipping out on my mom for talking to my son about becoming a big brother?,"My (38M) wife (38F) and I have one child together, a 6 year old son. When we got married, we agreed we both only wanted one child. A few years ago, my wife got her tubes tied.  I also got a vasectomy last year, just to cover all bases across the board. We didn’t announce this to the family, but it also wasn’t a secret. We’ve had a few people ask if we’re having another and that’s usually when it comes up.

I am one of 6 siblings. Our mother was one of 8 kids. Most of my siblings have had at least 3 children, if not more. Only my brother is also 1 and done. Our mother struggles to accept this and has said several times that we’ll change our minds. Even knowing that my wife and I physically cannot have more children, she’ll always bring up adoption or say that my procedure could be reversed, etc. My brother and I always shut it down, have told her we’re not changing our minds, etc.

Recently, she was babysitting my son while my wife and I went out. We picked him up after and on the car ride, out of nowhere, my son started crying and asking if we were having another baby. We said “no”. He said that his grandmother kept asking him if he wanted a baby sister and saying that we should have another baby, he could be a “big helper”, etc. 

We got home rather quickly, consoled him, and promised him we weren’t having another baby, and that his grandmother never should’ve told him this. I called my mom and got on her about this, telling her she stooped low by getting our son involved. She said that we’re overreacting and him crying over potentially getting another sibling is ridiculous and we’re raising a spoiled child. I argued no, he’s a sensitive kid who doesn’t do great with change, and she scared him. I told her that until I can trust that she won’t say these things to him, her babysitting privileges have been revoked and she’ll only be around him if my wife or I are there.

My brother backs me up on this, apparently our mother tried the same thing with his son, and it lead to a similar argument on their end. Our sisters think we’re overreacting and that this is a natural question and my mom is right that it shouldn’t have upset my son so much.

I am one of 6 siblings. Our mother was one of 8 kids. Most of my siblings have had at least 3 children, if not more. Only my brother is also 1 and done. Our mother struggles to accept this and has said several times that we’ll change our minds. Even knowing that my wife and I physically cannot have more children, she’ll always bring up adoption or say that my procedure could be reversed, etc. My brother and I always shut it down, have told her we’re not changing our minds, etc.

Recently, she was babysitting my son while my wife and I went out. We picked him up after and on the car ride, out of nowhere, my son started crying and asking if we were having another baby. We said “no”. He said that his grandmother kept asking him if he wanted a baby sister and saying that we should have another baby, he could be a “big helper”, etc. 

We got home rather quickly, consoled him, and promised him we weren’t having another baby, and that his grandmother never should’ve told him this. I called my mom and got on her about this, telling her she stooped low by getting our son involved. She said that we’re overreacting and him crying over potentially getting another sibling is ridiculous and we’re raising a spoiled child. I argued no, he’s a sensitive kid who doesn’t do great with change, and she scared him. I told her that until I can trust that she won’t say these things to him, her babysitting privileges have been revoked and she’ll only be around him if my wife or I are there.

My brother backs me up on this, apparently our mother tried the same thing with his son, and it lead to a similar argument on their end. Our sisters think we’re overreacting and that this is a natural question and my mom is right that it shouldn’t have upset my son so much. AITA?",0.0,0.0046263942494988,0,1
8,1g5x9iv,AITA for not washing plates?,"I am 21, I live in the dorms in my university and came back just for my mom's birthday last weekend. I had brought her a 250$ air fryer because she keeps complaining how her current one is old and crusty, it a gift I genuinely put a lot of thought and money into.

On the day of my moms birthday she just seems to be angry at everyone, my dad, my younger brother and me. She just was passive aggressive all throughout but she didn't really show it until we started sharing the gift. When she opened my gift she didn't have a reaction, I asked if she liked it and she just said I wonder why you didn't get your dad lawn mower on his birthday so I took that she didn't like the gift. She not an angry person so I don't understand why she was so upset on one of the days she supposed to be happiest on plus I feel like even if I didn't get the best gift for her she can at least show just a little bit of gratitude, at least that what I have done when people get me off gifts. 

I told her that just because it her birthday doesn't give her the right to treat the people around her like shit, she asked if this was really her birthday because it didn't feel like her birthday. My dad tried to mediate between the 2 of us but she just screamed at him and started screaming at all of us for not clearing and washing the plates the previous night. I don't understand why she would allow this one thing ruin her entire birthday and if she had asked me to wash the dishes I would have washed them(I had washed my individual plate). She went to guest room to lie down. And ever since then she has been sleeping in the guest room, she barely leaves the room and hasn't helped around the house. My brother (15yrs) has been feeling overwhelmed and sad because of the state of the house and my mom.

Does one instance of not washing plates on her birthday really need such a visceral reaction, I just don't understand my mom at the moment, maybe the internet can give me some perspective........",Asshole,2024-10-17,"AITA for not washing plates?

9,1g5x2a7,AITA for telling my husband's best friend he should stop bringing his wife to football nights?,"Once or twice a month my husband and his guy friends play a friendly football match and then we all have dinner together. It's been something we've been doing forever and it gives us (the wives and girlfriends) a chance to spend time together as well.

There's never been any issues before but recently my husband's best friend 'Daniel' has been disruptive to the game because his wife is pregnant and he can't last even 10 minutes before he has to run over to check on her. It was cute the first few times but now it's just causing the game to be delayed and for us to have to wait longer before we can eat. So I suggested he not bring her anymore because his excuse for checking up on her constantly is that he's worried she'll get cold or feel unwell because the pregnancy has been hard on her.

I thought it wouldn't cause an issue because Daniel only originally started bringing her because his parents got on his case for always leaving her home alone. Actually, Daniel only married her because of his parents and before her pregnancy he barely said two words to her in front of us so this change has been so weird to witness. Daniel didn't seem to have an issue with what I said and he even told me he would think about it but he pulled my husband aside the very same night to accuse me of having a problem with his wife. I don't have a problem with his wife. Even though our husbands are best friends I barely know her because she's never made an attempt to bond with the group and he doesn't bring her around often. Pre-pregnancy she would just sit quietly watching the guys play while the rest of us chatted. She only makes an effort with one person and that's a recent thing too.

I confronted Daniel the last time I saw him (his wife wasn't there) because I feel like if he had an issue he should've come to me. He's known me since we were kids and we were friends before I married my husband so it's not like I'm just his best friend's spouse. I admit I messed up by confronting him in front of others because now our entire friendship group knows what's going on and my husband is angry at me. The girls are all on my side (except for the one his wife is friends with) but some of the guys are being dicks by claiming I'm jealous of Daniel's wife and making gross jokes about me wishing I was pregnant with his baby which is a huge reason why my husband is so angry.

This morning I allowed my emotions to get the best of me and impulsively asked my mom for an allowance (it didn't help that she gloated about getting a LARGE raise soon and going back to college for free). I asked for 100 a week, I soon calmed down and talked to someone I trust and they helped me look at things logically.

12,1g5wliy,AITA for trying to get a neighbor to trim a hedge that was creating a dangerous intersection and ending up causing the hedge to be torn out almost completely?,"I live on a narrow street with one practical outlet.  That outlet is where out street ends in a ""T"" intersection with a bigger street (call it Speedway).  While Speedway is only one lane each way and a 30mph zone, cars often fly up and down it.  Where my street terminates at the T, there is a house on the corner (on left as you exit) with big hedges.  The previous owners of that house kept the hedge trimmed back, though it was still somewhat hard to ""look left"" and see if any cars are coming down Speedway.  Not ideal, but it was manageable.  The house changed hands around two years ago.  The new owners let the hedges grow substantially, to the point that it became impossible to see if a car was coming and quite dangerous to try to turn onto the bigger street.

I emailed the owners and asked if they might consider trimming the hedges to improve visibility, letting them know, in case they didn't, that the previous owners had done so.  I also pointed out that I thought that the hedges violates city code on visibility at intersections, though I didn't take the time to go cite chapter and verse in the code.  They responded curtly to the effect that they wanted the privacy of a high hedge and that drivers should creep out bit by bit and it would be fine.

About a month ago, my wife was driving to downtown and was behind a car trying to make the right turn onto the bigger street.  The driver was nosing out bit by bit, and then got smashed into by a car flying down the bigger street.  No one was seriously hurt, but the police did have to respond.  My wife (quick-thinking woman that she is!) stayed around as a witness and mentioned to the police officer than he should put in the report a comment about the hedge obstructing visibility.  At that point, I decided to go look closely at the code and saw that this hedge was totally noncompliant.  I sent another email to this effect to the neighbors, but they didn't respond.

I felt like my only choice was to go to the code enforcement department with the police report, pictures, and the code.  They agreed to go take a look, agreed it was totally noncompliant, and not only that, it turns out the hedge is on \*city\* right-of-way.  Apparently, the practice is the city gives the property-owner like 48hrs to fix a situation of this severity.  For whatever reason, the neighbors did not.  Public works showed up and fully tore out most of the hedge.

Now the neighbor is absolutely ripshit and blowing up my email, complaining to other neighbors and calling my family AHs.  I didn't intend for their hedge to be torn out, but I gave them ample opportunity to fix the problem before going to the city.

I do not call to offload on her and I make sure to ask lots of questions about her life, and am genuinely interested in it. I know it's a lot for anyone but I really do try to lessen the burden. 

I've been quite isolated, living in my own bubble with my dog as my safe guard. My anxiety is high. She suggested we go see a Broadway show as I've never been. I picked a show, she booked the tickets for evening and that was that. She has been a great support. 

What I originally thought would be a day out (big city 2 hours away, we both live in the same area) - my initial fault as I assumed it'd be a weekend - turned into her working in the city but she said she was taking a half day, but I could travel in and we'd have time to explore / eat. This turned into her having to work a full day, because people in city were excited to see her and she wanted to network. Fine. Then it turned to wanting to stay overnight as the tickets she booked meant we'd get home too late. 

I was calm on the call. This was my first trip in... too long. I said I wasn't comfortable staying overnight. I then sent a message saying essentially I was hurt because a trip about 'us' felt like it turned into a work opportunity for her. 

I did acknowledge her support, that I was sorry for raising it but it was on my mind. Listen, I know when I overreact and react badly. I really, really don't think I did here. Like I said, progress. 

She said she wasn't comfortable going on this trip with me...then blocked me on everything. 

What am I missing? 

6 year friendship, never fallen out, she also knows because of the work situation people have been blocking me (very unrelated, promise) so to take this action when I mentioned my feelings feels shitty. 

Help. AITA?

16,1g5vddh,"AITA for refusing to pay for most of my mother’s end of life care, even though I can probably afford it?","I (45f) am the oldest of a blended family of six. I have two full sisters (43f and 40f), a stepbrother (42m), a stepsister (39f), and a half brother (35m). My dad died when I was 7 and my mom (now 70f) married a guy she met in her deceased-spouse-with-kids therapy group about a year later. We all did family therapy for a few years before and after they married. We needed it because of grief and adjusting to a new situation, plus of course my mom and stepdad had my youngest brother together and we needed to adjust to that. IMO the therapy definitely helped us become a family unit and we all have been getting along well until now.

My stepdad passed away from a massive heart attack about two years ago, and my mom had a stroke about 3 months after the funeral. She initially recovered very well, but now we can tell she has rapidly progressing dementia and is starting to fall often. We had a family meeting and decided to start exploring continuing care communities, because we don’t think we can persuade her to move more than once. Then we discovered that it was way more expensive than we thought! As in, over $100k/year once she starts using the memory care full-time. This put the cat among the pigeons.

The issue isn’t the initial costs, because my mom’s house would be sold for about what the buy-in would be, and she has long-term care insurance that would pay about $70k/year for 3 years. Retirement savings and Social Security would cover the rest. The issue is if she lives longer than 3 years after moving in, which she could probably do. Most of my siblings could not afford to kick in $10k/month for potentially years if we divide the balance evenly. One of my sisters married very well (her husband has a trust fund plus he’s a partner at a large law firm), and my husband and I were very fortunate that his family’s plumbing business is doing very well, as is my small crafting business.

I don’t happen to think that we should do equal shares when the time comes, but rather evaluate annually how much each of us can afford. My stepsister thinks we should open a savings account that we all start kicking into so it won’t be such a financial shock in three years, and I like this idea, too. However, everyone else seems to think that because my husband and I own our own businesses (not true for him, he is partners with his brother and uncle), we should take out a loan with our businesses as collateral to pay for mom’s care. I am absolutely disgusted with them and told them flat-out that we wouldn’t do that. 

I know that my mom has been helping my stepbrother and my half brother financially, and that will stop once she moves into the facility, so I get why they are resisting any financial commitment. But any need to kick in money is probably 3 years away. They should be able to do something by then if they know now that it’s coming. For added info, we are all married with children, but mine will have finished college by the time my mom needs financial help. AITA?

My husband(28) has a friend, Tom(32m). Tom and I (26f) have never gotten along. One night my Husband had planned a get together. I came home from work exhausted and with a headache so I told my husband it was fine but I was going to bed. I noticed Tom had brought his daughter, Bree,a 5 year old with mental disabilities. I was a little frustrated at this because Tom had already been drinking which meant they would be staying night. She is a very sweet little girl but Tom has a hands off parenting approach which has caused her to get into things around my house and create huge messes. I figured id deal with everything in the morning and just went to bed. At around 2am I heard Bree crying. I got up to investigate and found our friends trying to calm her down. I asked them where Tom was and they told me he had went to Sheetz for food but had been gone a while. Bree did not know these people very well so she was not having it. I told them they could go home and I would handle it. I held her close and rocked her back to sleep. Soon after I heard Tom and his buddy come in my house. I confronted him and said he could not leave Bree at my house unattended. The whole time I talked he just scowled at me without a word. At that point I knew there was no getting to him till the morning and went back to bed. Morning came and I noticed Tom was not at my house. I checked my sons room and there was Bree sleeping peacefully. I was fuming. I instantly started calling him as I got ready for work. I decided I would call his BM to come get her. Tom's BM and him were co-parenting but she had already threatened to take him to court and they were on shaky ground. I knew this but I did not care. I had to work and my husband had our children to take care of and had said he did not want the extra responsibility, especially since we do not know all her needs. I called some people asking if they knew where he was and left messages on his phone telling him I was going to call his BM if he did not answer before I needed to go to work. An hour passed and I had 30mins till I needed to leave and I gave up. I had waited 3hrs total. I called his BM and explained the situation. She left work and came to her daughter immediately.

I tried convincing him to try using flash cards to study for his vocab tests, but he kept insisting that I drop the subject.  I also told him that he's being childish by making all these excuses and not taking responsibility.

24,1g5rd48,AITA for refusing to pay our utility bill when my roommates won't turn off the AC? ,"I (22F) rent a small house with two other girls the same age as me, since June of this year. Over the summer, the other two were adamant about keeping the house cold (around 65-66 degrees), saying they both run hot. It was in the 80's and low 90's for most of the summer so for the most part I was ok with it, I just had to wear a hoodie and sweatpants whenever I was at home.

Now that is it fall, they aren't changing their minds on the temperature of the house. It has yet to get below freezing at night, but it is getting close. This morning when I woke up it was 38 degrees, and the highs now are between 55-60 degrees. Earlier this week, I told my roommates that we should no longer be keeping the house so cold, especially when it is colder outside. They both said to ""check back in"" when it gets below freezing, and they weren't concerned about it until then.

It was so cold when I woke up yesterday that I was shivering as I was getting ready for work. Last night, I turned the thermostat to 70 and told them not to touch it. When I woke up this morning (again, 38 degrees outside), I was still very cold, and had slept in a full flannel pajama set and thick socks. They woke up and immediately started complaining that they were too hot while they slept and we needed to turn the temperature back down today. I told them no and then had to leave.

They have been texting in our group chat about keeping the temperature at 66 until it gets below freezing. They told me ""majority rules"" when it comes to house temp and then sent me links to space heaters, heated blankets, and snuggies. I told them they were both being incredibly unreasonable for wanting to keep the house that cold in the fall, when it was just barely above freezing at night.

Finally, I told them that I was sick of paying for the very high utility bill because they wanted it so cold. I told them that if I was expected to ""invest"" in ways to keep myself warm, then I would be paying a smaller portion of  1/3 of the utility bill. That's the price of wanting to keep it cold when I have asked many times that we don't. One girl told me I was being a ""complete asshole"" and making a big deal out of nothing. The other told me to stop being so dramatic.

so AITA?

  
Edit for info: Genuinely sorry to create confusion with air vs a/c vs hvac. To be clearer, my roommates want the thermostat set to COOL on 66 with the fan **manually on**. Whether this actually does anything for the house or not, I don't know, but it is cold outside and therefore cold inside without any source of heat. The other night I turned to the thermostat to 70 on heat, automatic fan, and they claimed it was too hot for them. 

The high bills that I was referring to were for the summer months, since they were very insistent on keeping the house at 65 usually. I would've personally kept at 70, maybe 69 on the hotter days. I complained a bit about the high bills back then in just a ""wow can't believe our bill is high"" way, but they said it would even out come colder temperatures when we had the heat on, but now they are now not wanting to turn the heat on. So in a way I guess I was suggesting backpay. 

As for the windows: our house is old, the windows have been painted over many times and do not have screens. They *do* open with some shoving and I did send a text to my roommates after reading the comments that they should request for the landlord to put in screens for them if they are going to be hot while they sleep. So, thanks for that suggestion. 

We get along pretty well besides this and have never had any major issues beyond figuring out how to share space and such.

27,1g5qjml,AITA for refusing to attend my sister's 4th wedding?,"My sister is about to get married for the fourth time BUT this is her second marriage. Confused? Let me explain. My sister Emily (39f) got married when she was 20 to Adam. She had Eliza (12) and Ryan (10) with Adam. But Adam sadly died when the kids were 3 and 5. Emily met John (42m) a year later at a group for widowed parents. They started dating about 18 months after they met and got married 7 months into a relationship. John has three kids with his late wife who are now 13, 11 and 10.

At their first wedding the kids were unhappy and as a result they acted out and ""ruined the wedding"". In reality the photos were a mess because the kids didn't want to be in them, wouldn't smile, there was fighting, etc. They wouldn't sit together and one of them knocked over the wedding cake. In addition there was so much attention on the kids that Emily and John felt their day had been overshadowed. So they went into therapy and after a little more than a year they decided to redo their wedding and try to make it perfect the second time around. But the kids were still unhappy and the wedding was still miserable for Emily and John because they had not created a blended family like they wanted and the kids were very open about this during the wedding and again didn't want to sit together or pose for photos.

Emily and John now have almost two more kids together. They have a daughter and Emily is expecting again. They want to retry the wedding once their last child is here. But their kids are still not blended and their household is intense and messy and not happy in the slightest. They are still in therapy though.

Most of the family are willing to do this so Emily can have a happy wedding. But I made it clear I won't be attending this fourth wedding. Emily told me I should be a supportive younger brother and come to the next wedding. I told her I was at her other three and I didn't want to attend several more of her weddings because she's trying to create a happy image when her family isn't happy. She told me I should be willing to attend as many as it takes and this next one is hopefully going to be it. She told me I shouldn't be judging her anyway. That she's doing her best.

“Family” = Mom, Brother; 
“GG” = great grandmother (family, but using her own tag for clarity); 
“Outside family” = those of my family, *not* including MB or GG. 

So for two years now, my Mom (52f), brother (19m), and I (18m) have been taking care of our GG (93f). 
Our GG has severe dementia, is bedridden, and has been in and out of the hospital. 
My family has been falling apart due to this. 

My mom has a broken back (literally, her spine is fractured), my brother has autism which has always made him more emotional (which leads to him getting upset and not fully understanding our GG), and I'm trying to attend community college so that I might get out of poverty. 

We are poor, but my mother receives SSD (social security disability, roughly $2000 a month. This is barely enough with housing bills, 4 household members, and medical bills.

Our GG cannot be put into a nursing home because her name is on our house, meaning they would take it to pay nursing bills (nor would my mother let her be, as she has seen how bad they *can* be).

Now, in the 2 years we have had our GG, my outside family has visited 3 times, made roughly 4 calls, and 2 invites to our GG’s other grandkid birthday parties. I do not care for my outside family, but my GG does, or did when she had her memory. She still remembers them when she sees them. 

I have been understanding for a few of my outside family; one cousin has a child and a father who is starting to get sick. But the rest have no good excuses to not even call. My GG raised over half of them. I am not exaggerating. 

One has posts constantly on Facebook about how she's going on another cruise every other month. 
Another says she can't be around our GG, because her husband died when she visited one time; and while I can understand her becoming anxious because of this, I do not accept this excuse. I don't, because she has used her husbands “death money” (life insurance?) to pay off the house *he died in*, which she still lives in, bought a brand new car, and she has traveled the US with the same money. 
The others have simply gone no contact.

——

Now, my GG likely won't live much longer. I've accepted this and have since a year ago, as her mind had already went by then. 

This means we will be having a funeral for her, sooner than later. If my outside family shows up, for whatever reason they might have, I'm very tempted to call them out. 

I've never been confrontational and believed in forgiving not forgetting. But if one of them starts crying or acting like they care, I might lose my composure.

29,1g5q8og,WIBTA for opening my own door lock,"So for a bit of context, my now ex boyfriend (M20) and I (F19) literally broke up two days ago. Tensions were high in the apartment and because I left the house to regulate my emotions since I have bpd and did not want to do anything I regretted I went for a walk. Because of me admitting this fact, both my roommate and him decided I was threatening them and are scared to be alone with me.

Since this argument that occurred Sunday, we agreed id sleep on the couch. However that doesn’t mean my closet isn’t in the bedroom still. Or some of my belongings. I am leaving to go to my parents house today around 2pm (currently almost 9am at the time of writing this) and need to pack my bag quickly. The issue is that since he’s so very scared of me (I’m about 5 inches shorter than him, 115 pounds soaking wet, and am incredibly weak so I do kinda find this funny I hate to say it) he’s been locking the bedroom door. And I believe it’s locked right now.

He doesn’t wake up until around 3pm which gives me no time at all to pack and would actually make me late for my train. The other day he locked the door because my roommate told him to without even considering I would need to possibly go in there, and he sleeps with earplugs so he didn’t hear me pounding on the door or spam calling him. I ended up just twisting the lock with a butterknife because I needed to be in there.

I’m planning on doing the same thing again because I’m not letting him make me miss my train.

WIBTA for opening the shared bedroom door to grab my belongings?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-17,"WIBTA for opening my own door lock So for a bit of context, my now ex boyfriend (M20) and I (F19) literally broke up two days ago. Tensions were high in the apartment and because I left the house to regulate my emotions since I have bpd and did not want to do anything I regretted I went for a walk. Because of me admitting this fact, both my roommate and him decided I was threatening them and are scared to be alone with me.

Since this argument that occurred Sunday, we agreed id sleep on the couch. However that doesn’t mean my closet isn’t in the bedroom still. Or some of my belongings. I am leaving to go to my parents house today around 2pm (currently almost 9am at the time of writing this) and need to pack my bag quickly. The issue is that since he’s so very scared of me (I’m about 5 inches shorter than him, 115 pounds soaking wet, and am incredibly weak so I do kinda find this funny I hate to say it) he’s been locking the bedroom door. And I believe it’s locked right now.

He doesn’t wake up until around 3pm which gives me no time at all to pack and would actually make me late for my train. The other day he locked the door because my roommate told him to without even considering I would need to possibly go in there, and he sleeps with earplugs so he didn’t hear me pounding on the door or spam calling him. I ended up just twisting the lock with a butterknife because I needed to be in there.

I’m planning on doing the same thing again because I’m not letting him make me miss my train. If he wakes up he’s going to be scared, I did not enter the room with the knife last time before I was aware they were scared of me and I don’t plan on bringing it in with me again. I just genuinely need to pack my things.

30,1g5pr3h,AITA for refusing to help my siblings with my estranged mother's end of life care?,"My mother, who I have been estranged from my entire adult life and since the age of 15, is terminally ill. She wasn't a great mother to any of her kids. There's me (27M) and my sisters (23F, 20F) and my brother (22M). But in saying that she treated me the worst and left me homeless at the age of 15 because I looked the most like our father, who she hated with every fiber of her being, and don't ask me why she had four kids with him I have no idea.

I went entirely no contact from that point on. My siblings still lived with her and according to them she got better once I was gone. 

My siblings have always downplayed how bad it was for me and how bad she treated me. So while I still talk to them I am not close to them and I don't know if there's a future where that will ever happen.

Which is why I refused to help them with her end of life care now that she's terminally ill. They say she has about a year left and needs a lot more help than they can cover. I told them it was not my job to make sure she goes out of this world in comfort and peace. They told me she's still our mother and I told them she was the fucking worst mother. That I would not shed a tear over her and I felt not one single ounce of obligation to her. They tried the ""do it for us"" angle and I told them they have minimized the stuff she did to me even though they said she got a little better once I was gone. So they know she hated me to her core. They told me I'm still her son, still their brother and I'm the oldest.

I even got a call from her adult social worker who had been told to contact me by my siblings. She wanted to go over my mother's care with me. I explained I would not be taking part in the end of life care for my mother, which surprised her but she left it alone.

My siblings think I'm a monster and they say I should be willing to do something. This has turned into a fight three times already.

I get a message from my best friend saying that ""E"" is talking to an acquaintance stating that it was messed up I didn't invite her to my wedding. They told her it wasn't a wedding but a kids party really. ""E"" told the acquaintance that it was going to be very hard for me to fix the problem with her. I took accountability and sent her a long message apologizing, it was my mistake and her invitation crossed my mind. A week later, she doesn't reply so I send her a follow up text. She made it about herself. She stated that she should have known I was a crappy friend because I was a shitty maid of honor. I asked her why? She then said because I didn't go to her Bachelorette party. I was a new mom and moved across the state when this happened. I even paid close to $300 for an event I didn't attend. I did drive across the state to attend her wedding. She said that she knows I was a new mom but that all her friends dropped what they were doing to attend her Bachelorette.

32,1g5nov0,AITA for voicing that I think my wife's parents need to back off on the advice to her cousin?,"My wife's cousin lost his wife 2.5 years ago. The cousin, who I'll call James, was left with 3 young children to raise. My wife's parents are very close to James and alongside James' parents (FILs brother and SIL) they have been suggesting James remarry and find a mother for the children and create a happy family for them again with the stability two parents bring that one cannot.

Everyone else, my wife, her siblings, James' siblings, other family members, they all know that James is in no place to find another relationship. He is not in the space where he would be a good partner to anyone else. His kids are not in a place where they would accept another woman coming into their lives in that way. Everyone else can see that pushing James to find a new wife right away is going to end badly, and has a few potential bad endings, with really nobody else seeing a chance for a positive one.

I have experience with this. My father lost his first wife when my half siblings were 6, 5 and 3. He married my mom 2 years later. My mom was crazy about my dad and truly loved my half siblings. My father felt like he had ""done the best thing"" for his kids by finding them another mother figure. Only my half siblings despised my mom, detested her, were hateful toward her until the day she died. When I (28m) came along three years into my parents marriage, it was to a ""family"" that was unhealthy and my mom was like a single parent to four, then five, kids. My father was more like a child who relied on her in a maternal sense than a man who had a spousal relationship. She was the person who wiped his tears while he sobbed over his late wife and who had to assure him the late wife still loved him. I, too, was resented when I came along. Of course there is also the fact my father never treated me the same as my half siblings. He was a father of four but a dad to only three of his kids. I was never acknowledged as a sibling by my halfs and when my mom died when I was 17 I was left with no family. My father ended up moving in with his oldest and that was the last I had any contact with them. My half siblings didn't come to mom's funeral or anything.

And at the core of everything was my father not being ready or in a place to move on. He married again for the wrong reasons. And while I wish like hell my mom hadn't stayed, she also grew up very alone with a very emotionally distant family, so she was just so desperate for a family and hoped she could make it work.

This is why when everyone else's suggestions to my ILs to back off James were met with deaf ears, I decided to speak up and suggest they leave James alone and back off on the advice they were giving him because he clearly isn't ready and I mentioned how it would be far worse for everyone if James and the kids aren't ready and he forces it because of the pressure being faced. They told me to mind my own business and accused me of trying to shame them with my history.

33,1g5njg2,AITAH for taking someone’s fishing spot?,"I (28M) started fishing a couple of months ago and have recently been trying a few new spots (I’m from Brisbane, Australia). 

Today, I went out to a small public jetty about 30 minutes from my house after work just before sunset. When I arrived I saw 3 people at the jetty, 1 mid-20s guy casting off on the left side and 2 older women (late 40s and late 60s) on the right hand side. I put my gear down (shopping bag and a crab net) and began to cast off from the central part of the jetty. 

After about 10 minutes, as I reel my line in,  the woman in her late 40s begins to cast where I am. Her line was going across where I was so I couldn’t cast my line without accidentally tangling with her or the man to my left. So I waiting for a few minutes, fiddling with my lure.

After about 2 minutes of pretending to fix up my rod politely, the young guy picked up his rod and moved to the seats behind us. I waited for about 2 minutes before moving to where he was and began to fish again. I was there for about 5 minutes before I hear someone approach me and turn to see the lady in her mid 40s. 

She comes within a metre of me and yells “How dare you, my son has been there for an hour and left to put bait on his rod and you just stole his spot”. I was a bit taken aback as I’m not usually the confrontational type and did not intend to steal the spot (my understanding is that when someone moves all their gear and does not come back, they are done with the spot). Although, I was not in the mood to be yelled at. I responded “how dare you walk up to me with that tone of voice. I’d be happy to move, but I’d appreciate it if you talk to me like a human being instead of yelling at a complete stranger”. 

She didn’t like that at all and began to arch-up again. She responded “I am talking to you like a human, you’re rude. You can’t just steal someone’s spot like that”. I responded “your tone of voice is disgusting, do not speak to me the way you are. If he wants his spot I’m happy to move. You don’t need to come over and yell at me” I then yelled over to the man and asked if he wanted his spot back, which he declined. She then walked away and fished the other side of the jetty with her son. 

20 minutes later, the young man came and fished where I was originally. I asked him if he wanted the spot by saying “hey man, would you like to fish here? I’m more than happy to move”. He declined and said it was okay, then said his Mum just gets angry because she gets her spot stolen all the time.

Jerry has severe digestive pain and problems if he consumes any gluten, though very slight contamination is generally ok. His family, who he lives with, eats glutenous foods all the time and he seems to have no problem with that.

Right now we are long distance, but we have visited each other a few times a year. I am not gluten intolerant. I love eating bread, cake, cereal, noodles and other glutenous foods. My culture's dishes contain A LOT of gluten. I have ZERO expectation that he eat any of this. When I visited I kept any glutenous foods separate from anything he would eat. All of that food was separately packaged and I thoroughly cleaned any utensils and dishes I used. I didn't use anything that couldn't be washed or thrown away when handling glutenous food.

Recently, we were discussing potentially moving in together. Jerry said we would both have a gluten free diet. I said that I didn't agree to that and want to continue eating my favorite foods. He got upset and said that contamination was a concern, so he wanted an entirely gluten-free household. I told him that I would adhere to strict cleaning and separation, but I wanted to be able to keep eating what I liked, and it's unfair to expect me to adhere to his dietary restrictions, especially if there have been no problems with me eating gluten when visiting or with his parents eating gluten. I also took issue with him just deciding what I would be eating for the rest of my life without even discussing it with me first.

That being said, I could be TA. I know that dietary restrictions can be very serious, as well as allergies. I have already given up banana-scented products due to him being allergic to them.

Update: Thanks for everyone's insights and advice! I spoke to my boyfriend and we came to an agreement. He explained that he was worried about contamination of pans (he likes using cast iron) and gluten-free food but agreed that having a fully gluten-free house when half of the residents (me) aren't gluten intolerant was unfair and expensive.

35,1g5mufi,AITA For Yelling At My Parents?,"I (20f) am my parent's only child. My entire life, they have been incredibly over the top. Every time I competed in any sort of competition, they would always cheer me on loudly, even when I lost. And this wasn’t normal cheering, mind you. This was the kind that was so obnoxious to everyone around that people wanted them escorted off the premises. This was a problem for me, because it was mortifying, and my parents were so loud and proud about my 'accomplishments' that most other kids didn't want to hang out with me. Eventually, I stopped telling them about most of my achievements, for fear of their overwhelming reaction.

Now, there is a college I had been hoping to get into my entire life. I moved out at 18, and since then, I have talked to my parents a lot and try to spend time with them, but l'm still secretive about everything I do. A year or so ago, I was accepted into the college I had dreamed of. I didn't tell them. I chose to celebrate with only my friends.

Now, there is a little girl in my neighborhood who I instantly bonded with years ago, and we have become like sisters since. This girl has parents, but they have been absent most of her life, only writing the occasional letter and having a once every five years visit. She's been raised by family working together to babysit. I know she loves her parents, and wouldn't admit this even to herself, but she feels like they have abandoned her, and I know she desperately wants loving parents who cheer her on and support her.

Recently, this girl visited my parents without my knowledge, and told them about my acceptance to this college (I think she accidentally let it slip, rather than directly telling them, though). They showed up on campus, and embarrassed me in front of my friends. I tried to stay calm around my parents, because I love them and want to stay on good terms, but eventually it got to be too much. For weeks, they cheered me on for every big and little thing I did, down to saying I was the best at mundane things that everyone does on a daily basis. Always in public. I never heard the end of the teasing, and after weeks of my parent's ‘encouragement’ (sometimes they even caused hazardous situations by getting in the way and causing distractions while I was trying to do things), I finally snapped. I yelled at them and told them this was exactly why I hide things from them, and that I just want them to leave me alone. My parents started crying, and left.

Later, my 'sister' showed up and got angry at me and asked why I would yell at my parents. I said she didn't understand my perspective, and that it was hard to have parents like that, as much as I love them. She then got all sad and said that she would give anything to have my parents, and that she had never had people support her before. I felt terrible.

I (20f) am my parent's only child. My entire life, they have been incredibly over the top. Every time I competed in any sort of competition, they would always cheer me on loudly, even when I lost. And this wasn’t normal cheering, mind you. This was the kind that was so obnoxious to everyone around that people wanted them escorted off the premises. This was a problem for me, because it was mortifying, and my parents were so loud and proud about my 'accomplishments' that most other kids didn't want to hang out with me. Eventually, I stopped telling them about most of my achievements, for fear of their overwhelming reaction.

Now, there is a college I had been hoping to get into my entire life. I moved out at 18, and since then, I have talked to my parents a lot and try to spend time with them, but l'm still secretive about everything I do. A year or so ago, I was accepted into the college I had dreamed of. I didn't tell them. I chose to celebrate with only my friends.

Now, there is a little girl in my neighborhood who I instantly bonded with years ago, and we have become like sisters since. This girl has parents, but they have been absent most of her life, only writing the occasional letter and having a once every five years visit. She's been raised by family working together to babysit. I know she loves her parents, and wouldn't admit this even to herself, but she feels like they have abandoned her, and I know she desperately wants loving parents who cheer her on and support her.

Recently, this girl visited my parents without my knowledge, and told them about my acceptance to this college (I think she accidentally let it slip, rather than directly telling them, though). They showed up on campus, and embarrassed me in front of my friends. I tried to stay calm around my parents, because I love them and want to stay on good terms, but eventually it got to be too much. For weeks, they cheered me on for every big and little thing I did, down to saying I was the best at mundane things that everyone does on a daily basis. Always in public. I never heard the end of the teasing, and after weeks of my parent's ‘encouragement’ (sometimes they even caused hazardous situations by getting in the way and causing distractions while I was trying to do things), I finally snapped. I yelled at them and told them this was exactly why I hide things from them, and that I just want them to leave me alone. My parents started crying, and left.

Later, my 'sister' showed up and got angry at me and asked why I would yell at my parents. I said she didn't understand my perspective, and that it was hard to have parents like that, as much as I love them. She then got all sad and said that she would give anything to have my parents, and that she had never had people support her before. I felt terrible. Both because I hurt my parents feelings, and because I forgot about her situation.

36,1g5mtbf,AITA for refusing to give my seat to a lady and her child?,"I (23F) was on my way home from work on the subway, totally exhausted. My company had organized a sports event that I was busy with all day. My commute is pretty long—about 50 minutes. Luckily, I got a seat and was about to doze off when, at the next station, a lady and her young boy (who looked about 8 years old) got on.

The lady was carrying her son, even though he looked perfectly capable of walking on his own. She walked straight toward me and motioned with her head for me to get up. She didn’t even say anything, and it felt like she was just expecting me to move. The boy wasn’t a toddler—he looked around 8 years old, so I didn’t see why she was carrying him.

Something about her face triggered me, so I bluntly said “no.” She seemed surprised and started talking about how someone my age should give up their seat for a mother carrying her child. She also made a few comments about how the younger generation is disrespectful. The lady herself looked like she was in her late 30s, and again, the boy didn’t seem to need to be carried at all.

A few people gave me dirty looks, and I felt awkward, but I stayed in my seat. However, once I got off and was walking home, I couldn’t shake the feeling that maybe I was in the wrong.

AITA?

Update- I was sitting in a regular seat, not a priority seat. And yes, I actually saw the child running and jumping around on the subway, shouting at times. It’s not just an assumption—he seemed perfectly fine. The mother didn’t bother to discipline him while he was shouting. Someone else eventually offered her a seat, and after that, she just sat down and started talking on her phone, probably complaining about the younger generation.

I found a therapist that I will be seeing and I will have my sessions on Wednesdays at 5:30. I live with my girlfriend in a two bedroom apartment but the walls are quite thin and even with the doors closed it's still pretty easy to hear noises from other rooms. 

This makes me uneasy as I don't want anyone overhearing my sessions. I asked my girlfriend if she would go to the gym when my sessions are on as she goes a few times a week anyway. 

She said no as she does classes at the gym and they aren't on on a Wednesday. I suggested seeing family or friends but she refused those options too. I asked if she'd mind using headphones for the hour I'm at in the session just so I know I'm not going to be overheard. 

She refused and said she shouldn't have to wear headphones in her home but I just mentioned that it was a pretty small ask since it was just for one hour a week.

She refused again and said I shouldn't be expecting her to do it but I just told her it was a small favour to ask but she told me I should drop it.

38,1g5mo5h,AITA for refusing to help clean the house,"I (26F) live with my boyfriend (28M) in his grandmas house (70F) along with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend (both 21). My boyfriend and I are moving out soon, but the situation has caused many arguments, so I’m looking for an outside opinion

I clean up after myself and my boyfriend in shared spaces I clean the bathroom after use, scrub the toilet after I use it, wipe down surfaces after showering etc and hoover up my dog’s hair in areas she’s allowed to go in. When I use the kitchen which is very rare due to the state of it, I wash my dishes and clean up before and after cooking. I mainly stay in our room, eat pre packaged ready to ear foods or take out and everyone agrees that I don’t leave any mess behind me and regularly joke if I wasn't seen no one would know if I ever left our room.

The issue is that I don’t help with general cleaning, like dishes after meals because I don't eat the same meal as everyone else ever, or deep-cleaning tasks. My stance is that I clean up after myself, and if everyone did the same, there wouldn’t be a mess. The others leave food out, splatter sauces, and don’t clean the bathroom properly (stains left in the loo, urine on the seat and floor etc) Basic food hygeine is never followed which is why i buy my own foods, and theres often meat left open on the side to defrost for days at a time which attracts flies. There's a lack of hygiene, which results in frequent sickness for his grandma and brother, and I refuse to clean up after them because I don’t contribute to the mess.

While I understand I should help an elderly person, shes perfectly able bodied and has no issues stopping her from being hygeinic, shes just got nasty habits. Equally my partners brother and girlfriend don't clean up after themselves ever and I'll be damned if I clean up after grown ass adults.  

Despite this, my boyfriend thinks I’m causing tension and should make a compromise and help for the sake of peace like he does. I refuse as in my eyes it's his choice to clean up mess he isn't making, I'm not a live in cleaner, she is not my relative, I pay a ridiculous amount of rent for 1 bedroom, and in my opinion it's a health hazard and I'm not risking my health to clean up her mouldy festering messes.

I'm 19F and I'm ""friends"" with another girl 19F in college. we have a group of friends around 6 to 7 people.

I know her for a year and we were roommates for the entire last semester.

It seems like she has some issues with me because for the longest time I've felt that she actively ignores me, always tells the other friends to come sit with her and if I sit next to her in class she'll tell me to move for another one of our friends to come sit. they always talk and gossip about stuff but I feel excluded.. yesterday she was talking about some "" tea "" she found out to our other roommate and when I asked what's the tea she just gave a weird look at me.

Even when sharing food she never asks me and asks the others.

We currently live in a dorm where I, she, and one other girl live together as roommates and they always talk mostly to each other and don't include me in conversations, laugh a lot and go to the cafeteria together too. even while going in the elevators she will hold the elevator for her but not for me.

If she and I are alone in our room in cases where our third roommate hasn't arrived yet, she won't speak a word and has this weird expression on her face but as soon as our other roommate enters the room she livens up and starts talking to her and smiles and laughs and all.

She basically is super lively with the rest of our friend group and actively jokes with them and does things friends do but I feel like it's not the same with me. Maybe I'm just overthinking this?

Background:

My parents left everything they had in my country, moved to the US, lived in absolute poverty, and slaved away for years to give me a chance at a good life here.

Though I love and appreciate my parents, I feel like Living with them during undergrad has hindered my ability to make close friends or get a relationship. I can’t invite anyone over but also I can’t afford to go out and hang out.

When my dad realized that the student housing at my new school is relatively cheap, he asked if the family could move in with me there. We are extremely poor and paying 1 rent vs. 2 is a huge difference. Mentally though, I don’t know if I can take it anymore living with my parents. They constantly fight and both have several mental illnesses that they refuse to acknowledge. They also don’t speak English so if they aren’t living with me, they have to move in with my older sister who is also financially struggling and very busy as she is in grad school.

Now I've been going to concerts for 10 years now and I've never had this happen ever. We obviously didn't move because why should we. He then proceeded to complain the whole time about how he couldn't see even though I was the shortest person in front of him. I couldn't see either over all the tall people in front of me but I just know that's how it goes at concerts. I turned around and told him to his face that ""it's a concert and it's general admission and if you wanted your own spot you should've never left or you should've bought seat tickets.""

I had conflicting feelings about doing that because he was with his daughter. But it's not like she was a little kid. I'm more than willing to let a short little kid move in front of us but the guy was a grown man and his daughter certainly  wasnt a little child anymore. 

After I told him off, he just looked at me funny and then complained the whole set about how me and my buddy took their spot until they left. They didn't even stay to listen to the whole set. It's freaking Iron Maiden.

49,1g5kfl0,AITA for storming out on my boyfriend after he said I’m a strong independent woman?,"So, here’s the situation. Lately, I’ve been feeling like I put a lot of energy into making sure the people in my life—my friends, family, and my boyfriend—are doing okay. I check in on their mental health, help out with financial advice, and try to be there emotionally for them. But the thing is, I’m starting to feel drained. I don’t expect constant attention, but it would mean a lot if someone, especially my boyfriend, checked in on me once in a while.

The other night, I told my boyfriend how I’ve been feeling underappreciated. I explained that just because I seem like I have it all together doesn’t mean I always do. I told him that I wish people—especially him—would sometimes ask how I’m doing, just to show they care.

His response? He laughed a little and said, “But you’re a strong, independent woman. You don’t need anyone checking in on you.”

That comment made me feel so dismissed. It felt like he was saying that because I’m capable, I don’t deserve or need support. I told him that just because I seem independent doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate someone caring about me. But he kept saying I was “making a big deal out of nothing” and that I “should be proud” he sees me as so self-sufficient.

At that point, I got really upset, grabbed my stuff, and left his place without another word. Now he’s texting me, saying I was overreacting and asking why I made such a big deal out of what was supposed to be a compliment.

50,1g5k4lz,AITA For not spending time with my moms childish boyfriend?,"So, My mom (50F) got a boyfriend (47M) a few months ago. He's a great guy for her and I (17F) have met him a few times, however, for me, he is absolutely insufferable every time I try to interact with him. Every conversation results in him ""jokingly mocking"" me, giving me weird/rude looks (Such as scowling at me for asking a question, rolling his eyes at a simple statement, generally just acting like an extremely immature teenager.), refusing to answer simple questions if I'm trying to do something for him, and just generally extremely childish behavior every time I try to have a conversation with him. Don't get me wrong here, I don't hate him at all, I just have a strong dislike for almost every interaction we've had.

I've tried so many different ways of interacting with him, including my behavior in the interaction, and nothing seems to change. I've brought this up multiple times that I just find it generally rude the way that he treats me (since he doesn't do this to his daughter, or my mother) to my mother and him, and there has been no change at all.

My mother stays at his house a lot, which I'm quite content eith since I enjoy living alone for short periods of time while I try to get my bearings of being an adult and living alone, and it allows me to avoid interacting with him. However, recently my mother brought it up that she dislikes that I don't spend any time with them at his house, and while I brought it up to her about how he treats me she seemed to just brush it off that ""He's Childish"" and ""Don't take it to heart"". I can understand being childish, and I know it's fun and games and all, but when every conversation I have with a 47 year old man makes me feel like I'm speaking to a 14 year old boy and just being mocked for asking a simple question or saying something, I lose my want to be around that person, as I assume some others would too.

I should mention that while I don't spend time with my mothers boyfriend, I do spend time with his daughter (19f) who I get along with quite well, but the only time we spend time together is outside of her house, or watching movies at my Moms house, or going out to the farm (Which my mothers boyfriend refuses to go up to)

Context to the farm : Her boyfriend used to race horses, so he isn't used to riding horses let alone the horses not being his own, so he gets frustrated because he isn't able to do what he wants with said horses in ""fear"" I guess of ruining their training, so he doesn't come up to the farm.

I didn’t understand what narcissism was and I was literally being mentally abused everyday and somehow he managed to do it from far because I moved in with Emily for work in her state so him and I were long distance for a while. I moved out before her wedding and got my own place.

I rejected being her bridesmaid respectfully because my ex husband refused and not listening was going to jeopardize our relationship. She was going to pair every bridesmaid with one of the best men for the duration of the wedding, this includes dancing and being together the whole night basically.

53,1g5jrjq,AITA for reporting my desk mate's cheating because he made me super uncomfortable?,"This happened a few months ago before I graduated, but I've been thinking about it recently and wanted some insight because I'm still conflicted about it.

I (18m) had an English class with this guy F (19m) my senior year/his junior year.  We didn't talk much, we had been assigned seats together a few times and made small talk (where I learned that information about him) but not much else. He was kind of weird and apprehensive sometimes, but I chalked it up to being anxious about Junior year which is understandable because Junior year suuuucked. In this English class, we had a monthly review test; it was always announced weeks beforehand, and usually happened about the same day every month. We would go over the answers beforehand, then put all of our notes away and do the test for 15 minutes (it was like 5-10 questions tops), turn them in, and go over the answers the next day.  I had noticed this F guy get a slip of paper from one of the other guys in the class, and tried not to pay attention too much, because that's not my business. You do what you've gotta do. However, once the test started, I watched this guy sitting right next to me (this was a public school, mind you, so the desks weren't very large) shove his hand into the front of his pants. Just right into the crotch. This happened a few times before I heard the sort of crinkly paper sound and realized that he was hiding the piece of paper he had been given in the crotch part of his pants and then retrieving it to look at the answers before shoving it right back into his pants. I felt sick to my stomach, which has genuinely never happened to me before, but I seriously thought I was gonna hurl. The teacher called the time, and we tidied up all of the testing stuff, and I watched as F took the piece of paper back out of his pants, shoved it elbow deep into the trash can, and then grabbed a tissue and delicately laid it over the top. And then sat back down. Like nothing happened. I was decently chummy with the teacher, so after class I asked to talk with her and told her to please never ever sit us together again because yes, I'd caught him cheating, and he kept shoving his hands down the front of his pants. Apparently one of his friends overheard (though to be fair i think he was standing a few feet away, and though I tried to whisper it's understandable that he would have heard. Whoops) and he cornered me in the hallway and confronted me about it, very angrily asking to see my phone and what ""proof"" I had and why the hell would I snitch to the teacher kind of on loop. I told him to fuck off and I don't owe him anything and went on with my day. Later, though, I talked to one of my friends about it, and she said it was OK that I was uncomfortable but I shouldn't have said anything about it to the teacher and just dealt with it.

We would go over the answers beforehand, then put all of our notes away and do the test for 15 minutes (it was like 5-10 questions tops), turn them in, and go over the answers the next day.  I had noticed this F guy get a slip of paper from one of the other guys in the class, and tried not to pay attention too much, because that's not my business. You do what you've gotta do. However, once the test started, I watched this guy sitting right next to me (this was a public school, mind you, so the desks weren't very large) shove his hand into the front of his pants. Just right into the crotch. This happened a few times before I heard the sort of crinkly paper sound and realized that he was hiding the piece of paper he had been given in the crotch part of his pants and then retrieving it to look at the answers before shoving it right back into his pants. I felt sick to my stomach, which has genuinely never happened to me before, but I seriously thought I was gonna hurl. The teacher called the time, and we tidied up all of the testing stuff, and I watched as F took the piece of paper back out of his pants, shoved it elbow deep into the trash can, and then grabbed a tissue and delicately laid it over the top. And then sat back down. Like nothing happened. I was decently chummy with the teacher, so after class I asked to talk with her and told her to please never ever sit us together again because yes, I'd caught him cheating, and he kept shoving his hands down the front of his pants. Apparently one of his friends overheard (though to be fair i think he was standing a few feet away, and though I tried to whisper it's understandable that he would have heard. Whoops) and he cornered me in the hallway and confronted me about it, very angrily asking to see my phone and what ""proof"" I had and why the hell would I snitch to the teacher kind of on loop. I told him to fuck off and I don't owe him anything and went on with my day. Later, though, I talked to one of my friends about it, and she said it was OK that I was uncomfortable but I shouldn't have said anything about it to the teacher and just dealt with it. Another basically said the same thing, but he also witnessed this guy muttering profanities under his breath walking past us and thought it was hilarious. I have no idea how to feel, so...

So it's hard to give more than surface level responses. 

Dan tells me that he's not doing too well and he has mentioned that quite a few of his friends are leaving him, or distancing themselves from him during an ongoing situation (No details because I'd like to keep it private). I made a promise to him that I wouldn't ditch him.

But earlier today I found out from a mutual friend, who is much closer to the situation than I am, that a lot of Dans vents to me are grossly misconstrued versions of the events. He's leaving out key details that paint him in a bad light and playing the victim to me while everyone else is aware of what he's done. He's also omitting events entirely from the current situation and has told me gross lies about his other friends prior to it. I've seen screenshot proof and heard another mutual friends perspective on it as well. 

Finding all of this out has left me feeling like I've been gaslit. I'm reconsidering my promise to him, as he is not acting like the kind of person I want in my life.

58,1g5iy1e,AITA if I (26M) have a crush on my friend's (26M) situationship (26F)? WIBTA if I told the girl he's lying to her?,"
I want to clarify that I normally don't get close with my friends' girlfriends or girls they like but this one time, I already knew that my friend is into this girl and she's obsessed with him. They only met a month ago and none of them want to be in relationship yet, but they both get jealous if one flirts with other people.

This friend I mentioned (let's call him John), has been very honest and loyal to me. He's a womanizer but he never tried to hit on a girl that I was serious about. He's considerate and respectful, to me at least. And he trusts me with some of his secrets. 

Lately I became friends with the girl he's in a situationship with (let's call her Ana) and we've been spending lots of time together. I don't know when or how I developed a crush on her but I don't cross any boundaries nor do I try anything weird. 


The main thing that's been on my mind lately is that John has been more interested in another girl, he makes excuses or lies to Ana to hangout with the other girl knowing that if Ana finds out she'll be upset. 

And I feel stuck, both of them are my friends. I don't want to betray John's trust but at the same time I don't like that Ana is being mislead and lied to and I don't think she deserves to hurt. I've been keeping John's secret so far because it's between them and I don't want to betray his trust. But at the same time it Ana gets hurt or worse cheated on I might feel very guilty for not informing her. 

Am I weird for still talking to Ana despite having a crush on her and hiding my feelings about her from John? I probably am. And what would you do in my situation? Would I be the asshole if I told Ana that John's hiding things from her and seeing another girl behind her back? 

P.S. I just want to mention that even though I like the girl, I have no interest in being in a relationship right now and  I have no intention of hitting on her. I just enjoy her company.

Edit: I think me saying that I like Ana has lead to some misunderstandings here. I don't want to date her and I don't want them to stop seeing each other. But just like John, Ana is also a good friend of mine who has been there for me in tough times.

For the past few months there has been a dog wondering around my neighborhood, she's a young female pitbull breed.
Well it turns out that her owners went to jail and then moved away and left her with the druggy neighbor to look after her. Said neighbor hasn't feed her because she was coming to my yard digging through my trash and her ribs were showing. So I have been feeding her for the past few months and only recently has she let me pet her. She was severely beaten and was scared of everything that moved.
She stayed outside during two hurricanes because her owners were never there. When she finally allowed me to touch her I gave her a flea pill and two baths because she was just covered in fleas.
Everytime I scratched her at least 10 fleas would fall off. Anyways we have contacted the owners many times and have given them two months to come get her but they keep coming up with excuses. The whole time I have been feeding her multiple times a day, taking tons of cuddle breaks, and letting her sleep in my bed (she was used to sleeping outside in a hole under her owners porch). Well I can't keep her because my parents won't let me and she tends to get territorial with my dog over me(so I can't keep her when they always fight and frankly it's sad that she trusts me that much in such little time). The other neighbors want her gone because she's going through everyone's trash and one has threatened to ""beat her on the head"" iykwim.. so we posted her on Facebook asking for a good family to take her but the owners are mad that we are getting rid of the dog. So AlTA for giving away someone else's neglected dog?

So since their are a comment I just wanted to answer a few: 
1. Take her to a shelter- I live in a really small town so I’m not aware of any shelters that aren’t over a few hours away but I will do more research to find some. I am also hesitant to put her into a shelter because I’m the only one she’s been able to bond with and I don’t want her to feel abandoned again. She doesn’t let me leave her side when I take her outside to potty, I guess it’s because she doesn’t want me to leave her outside? I’m not sure but she doesn’t like to be alone and I don’t think a shelter would give her the attention she needs bc she needs a lot.😂 However I will try to find one and get something set up as a last resort. 
2. You can’t take their property/ that’s illegal- they left her in an abandoned house and took her collar off. They left her no food, water , or shelter. We have contacted them many times telling them they need to come get her and stuff but they never did. The neighbors are all mad that she is running up and down the neighborhood starting fights and digging in trash, so a few of the neighbors are wanting to “get rid of her”. We have told the owners this but they keep brushing it off. If they wanted the dog they would not leave it there to die. Also I am in law school and I talked to a few of my professors today, they all agreed that from a legal standpoint I should be okay and that if they were to press charges I could rebuttal with animal abuse but they all agreed that I should at least file a report or ask a shelter before giving her away. Also as i mentioned previously the owners have been to jail on multiple accounts for different drug and theft crimes so I doubt they will be willing to go to the police for help to get their dog.
3. Also regarding me posting her on Facebook- I know this was dumb so I took it down but I really just wanted to be able to know and trust who was I was giving her too.

Daughter ghosted us. ,"Last week I spoke with my husband and we made a joint decision to say something to our daughter and son in law about leaving their 14 and 11 year old children (our grandchildren) at home while they go out at night time on a average of 3 nights a week together and at least another night  separately to other things.  Firstly, I want to say, my daughter is a great mum, she loves her kids as does he but they are very selfish when it comes to being at home at night times both on weekends and weekdays with their kids.  This is not about alcohol or drugs, they don't do either, this is about motorcycle club.  They are out riding their street bikes out at night with their club friends.  They also go to functions with them and my daughter is always at concerts or theatre and the list goes on.  She has a wonderful zest for life but sometimes  we beleive at the detrement of her kids.  The kids are safe, they are not at harm, they contact them throughout the night to see they are ok and at times ask them along but the kids are happy to stay at home. We text "" What is happening with your kids when you are out every night. You have got to stop it. You and Brad are both out of control leaving them all the time. Lilly is 11. Stop justifying it. Because it is not right.""   My daughter replied telling me to go and start an argument with someone else she wasn't interested in arguing with me and that they are entitled to have time away from their kids and she doesn't need to justify it to us.  (I can count on one hand the amount of disagreements we have had in her 34 years of age).  They live 1600 klms away so I can't baby sit or offer help and this hurts.  They are kids raised on technology and they live inside them and they are safe inside them.  Since then, I have contacted her by text and phone to which she has ignored both and she has also blocked me from seeing anything on her instagram. I am hurt because I can see this destroying our family but I will be honest and say I knew before I sent the initial text that she could and may remove us because that's exactly what she has done to multiple people in her life.  I just thought we had a better relationship and if you knew our family and our life you would be absolutely gobsmacked that this has happened. We pay to fly their children 3 out for the 4 school holidays each year to our house for them to stay for the whole holidays and they are loved and adored. We visit the whole family at least 3 times a year also and we pay for all the dinners and functions we attend, we have great conversations support them in their lives but this one thing has us dismayed.

62,1g5hy1x,AITA for not telling my MIL the dress code for an event that she’s turning into a competition with me?,"AITA?

I got married to my husband a little over a month ago before he left for the army. We’ve been together for 2 years, best friends in high school, and have known each other for almost 10 years. My MIL has had some strong opinions about us getting married and has said some nasty stuff about me behind my back but then is nice towards me. She and her husband told my husband he was ruining his life by marrying me and that I was going to cheat on him and run off with his money… I feel guilty using his money to pay for his own car payment and insurance even tho he’s reassured me it’s absolutely more than fine. My husband has a ceremony coming up that is “business casual / Sunday best”. With that, I have a nice outfit planned to take pictures with him in his uniform. My MIL wants my mom, who she has never had any intention of getting to know and then bashes my mom for not being “more inviting”, to make 10+ shirts for her and her family to wear to the ceremony. I personally still want to wear something nice for my husband who himself thinks the matching shirts of 10+ people is embarrassing and is going to draw unwanted attention from his DIs. At the time of the ceremony it will be over 2 months since we last saw each other and he also agreed on me wearing a nice outfit for pictures and helped me pick out what i’m wearing. We have absolutely no problem making the shirts for her and her family but since i’ve told her I’m wearing something different, she is no longer responding to my messages (for a week, now) and I had an emergency tonight and couldn’t get ahold of her. AITA for not telling her the dress code?

64,1g5huu2,AITAH for not allowing my sister use my vacation home,"I (52 M) grew up relatively lower class in New England with three siblings. Our parents were separated and were only worried about keeping food in the house and bills payed. We had never even left NE until college, vacations of any type were off of the table. I have always had a decent relationship with all my siblings besides my younger sister (40 F). Even though I am 12yrs older than her and shouldn’t let her get under my skin the way she does, she always finds a way. My sister is incredibly entitled in a way I can’t put into words. She wanted everything to go her way no matter what. She bossed everyone around like a foreman and never took care of her own responsibilities. The worst part was, she is incredibly messy. Leaves all her things everywhere, messy eater, etc. Her clothes would be anywhere you least expected in our childhood home. Due to my parent's push-over nature, she was never corrected. We all thought she would grow out of this behavior naturally. Long story short, she did not.
Without getting into much detail, after busting my ass and a long road of stress I ended up getting a scholarship to an exceptional university and ended up making a decent life for myself through law.
After school I moved away from NE to a nice, quiet midwestern state, effectively ending most communication with my family. This is where I met my now wife (49 F). She worked as a dentist in the beginning of our relationship, but we quickly got married and she became a SAHW a few months before she started carrying our 1st child. I love my wife. She loved California. I wanted to make her and our children happy whilst simultaneously living out my own childhood dreams of finally being able to travel freely. After our 3rd child, with us being in a good place financially, I got us a beach house on the coast of CA.
Fast forward to present time, I have 4 great children, and a happy home. Last week, my sister contacted me via Facebook asking to stay in my vacation home. Mind you, I have not spoken to her since a funeral 2 years ago. She would not have even known about my beach house the whole 10 yrs i've had it if it weren't for FB. I told her it was an absurd request and it wasn't going to happen. Not only do l believe it is rude to ask regarding our rocky relationship, but I have spoken to her husband and I know she never grew out of her messiness. She then called me and my wife an array of names in a rant about how she had never experienced traveling like she had always wanted to and I, as her brother, should help her. I told her it's not my responsibility to help her and I wouldn't want to regardless due to her behavior. She responded with telling me I am a privileged pos.
I don't understand why she would call me this as we started out on the same foot. We had the same parents and the same opportunities. I blocked her and I was informed by a family friend that she then made a post about how you can't even trust your own blood or something like that.

For background; Alex and Carly split up when my before my godchild's 1st birthday and had told both parents parents when they split as I was friends with both that I would never pick a side between them, and that the only side I would pick if asked would be my godchild's as they were the one who would get hurt the most in all of this and I've tried my hardest over the years to hold true to that statement. There were several years of pettiness the first few years of my godchild's life and things changed when my godchild was about 7. Carly wanted to co-parent and Alex wasn't thrilled with the at first. I pushed hard for him to give things a chance and he relented. 

Things have been decent until recently. A few months ago, Carly filed for emergency custody of my godchild, one reason being that my godchild says the feel unsafe because of something Michelle did (gave their address to strangers). Carly has done stupid stuff too. The decision hearing was a few weeks ago and Alex asked me to take his side and I told him I wouldn't take either his or Carly's side. He wanted me to say his house was safer than Carly's and I told him I could say Carly has done stupid things to put his child in danger but I couldn't lie and say his wife hadn't done stupid stuff that endangered his child too, that I'm a double edged sword to both he and Carly and would only speak in court if his child's law guardian asked me to.

After taking some time to really think about how I brought up how I felt when he took it upon himself to move my mom down the row during the ceremony my dad really blew things up.
It has been a month since the wedding and i decided i should call him to clear the air.  He wouldn’t even let me speak besides how I started “so I wanted to get something off my chest… I was upset to see that my moms seat had been moved down the row at the wedding.”
He then went off on me with some story about how she did something first.  Wouldn’t let me talk, then said “fuck this shit” and hung up on me.
I sent a text starting with “read when you can” and talked about how I don’t care about any of that… for one day I wanted you to think about my feelings and not about how much you hate my mom.  But I did say it nicer, it ended with how could you take it upon yourself to change things without at least talking to me.
I’ve now received two texts I haven’t answered that go on to plan my mom and tell me that he won’t sign up for shit that involves her again.  
My parents have been divorced for 30 years and both are remarried.  One for 25 and the other 18.  I don’t understand how he couldn’t put his feelings to the side for twenty minutes during the ceremony.  And I don’t understand how when I try to have a calm chat about how I feel  about it all I get so much shit.

72,1g5gs7r,AITA for not even trying to converse with my dad anymore? ,"It sounds extremely rude at first, and it is. But I think I sort of have a right to feel the way I do. I (17f) have a dad whose daily schedule is wake up, work, come home (sometimes, if he doesn’t come home, then he’s out with his friends drinking) eat, watch tv in his room, sleep. That is literally it. He talks to me sometimes when he sort of has to cause I’m the only one with him or because he needs help with something. Usually, I would greet him from work with a hug or something and ask him about his day and he would do the same to me. That is about the most common affection we have really. I thought it was normal because that’s the way it had always been since I can remember. He rarely eats dinner with my family, and when he does he’s on his phone scrolling through TikToks or staring at the tv. 

Anyways, the real part I feel conflicted on is my behavior that I purposely started this year. I figured that since he rarely ever even talks to me I’ll just straight up ignore him or put very little effort into our relationship. He doesn’t put effort into his relationship with his family, so why should I do that with him? I sometimes greet him from work, I give him one word answers and I sort of just avoid him cause whenever he does talk to me, it is so forced it hurts. I didn’t think much of it and saw it as okay I guess but my mom one day told me why I don’t text my dad during my lunch break at school anymore (I used to do that daily but then stopped). She basically guilt tripped me into feeling bad for him cause he told her about it. I feel like he does deserve to be ignored because that’s the way he treats his family, but at the same time I feel bad cause he is a roofer, so he works all day in the hot sun just for my family. If I were to work all day in the hot sun, I know I would want to be alone too once coming home. I don’t really know if I should feel bad for him or not.

My mom usually takes a long time to make up her mind, we’ve lived in the same house for 15 years and she’s still deciding on paint colors lol. I didn’t really care what kind she got but mentioned that I like magnolias when my mom pointed a few out.

The other day my aunt dropped off two trees, a crepe myrtle because that’s what she thought my mom liked the most and a magnolia. We weren’t home at the time but when my mom called to thank her I overheard my aunt saying that they were Christmas and birthday gifts combined for both of us.

For one thing I very obviously didn’t care about the tree besides mentioning that I like magnolias. The tree was my mom’s thing.

1. I am 36.5 weeks pregnant with my first child.
2. There has been tension this year between my parents and my spouse and I because I have started setting boundaries after realizing that their behavioral patterns are not what I want for my future relationship with them or for my child.

The story:
My parents have had some bad car luck - both cars in major accidents in the last few weeks. We are happy they are safe and not injured. One car, a company car, which they intend to purchase soon, is undergoing repairs and they have a loaner. The other car is totaled. Although this sucks, my parents are very well off can easily afford to buy a new car, lease, or even get a rental for a bit.

My husband and I have two cars. One is our drivable, main vehicle. The other needs major work, which we have been holding off on due to finances and logistics (e.g., one car works for us for now). My parents tried to pay for the car work earlier this year without asking whether we would be okay with that. Past experiences show a pattern of these financial goodwills turning into control and reasons why our boundaries are unreasonable to them. Ultimately, we told them we did not feel comfortable taking financial assistance from them. We sense my parents feel like we are ungrateful because we have decided we need to handle this and don’t want to take money from them.

With my parents’ car situation, they just asked us for the following favor. To avoid having to pay for a new car lease or a rental and because they have supported us when we needed help (their words), they want us to arrange to have our secondary car fixed so they can pick it up when they visit their new grandchild and drive it for six months. In exchange, they will pay for the repairs. From their perspective this is a mutually beneficial offer rather than a favor on our part. From our perspective this a) crosses a boundary we have been trying to hold with the financial piece and b) feels like a big request to make of very soon to be (again 3.5 or less weeks) first time new parents. We would need to arrange a tow, figure out the shop to take the vehicle to, get our insurance in order, update the car registration and then hand it off to my parents (who are hours away) all while also trying to wrap up our own to do list before Baby arrives any day now and possibly continuing to handle this in the first couple weeks postpartum with no sleep and a new little life to focus on.

She takes care of the kids most of the time while I bring in the money. Recently she planned a girls trip for a weekend from Friday night to Monday and says I have to watch the kids for the weekend. I think this is crazy because she is better with kids as a mother. And since I work so much I should be the one going on vacation.She says that I don’t  know how it is taking care of the kids. And went on this whiny rant about how she has to take them to school and pack lunches and help with homework. But i work longer than her so I think I have it harder. I shouldn’t have to babysit the kids so my wife can be lazy and have fun when she does have of the work i do.I can take off work for Monday to babysit the kids but I don’t want to so I can prove a point.

She says I’m sexist an controlling and selfish but I disagree so AITA? I’m 

Edit: okay I get it I’ll talk to my wife about it tomorrow and explain that working long hours and being stressed out as an accuse for how I acted. just please don’t share this to much my wife sister uses reddit and i dont need her seeing this and showing it to my wife.

80,1g5etnu,AITA for not letting the relationship end?,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years (unofficially), 2 (officially), this is both of our’s first relationship and I told her from the jump that I wanted something serious with her so I met her parents and asked for their blessing before making anything official. 

Our first year of being a couple was amazing, always hanging out, talking all the time, complimenting eachother, just showing genuine love to eachother. But things started to change when we both started college, my girlfriend didn’t have a lot of freedom during highschool so she wouldn’t go out that often with friends (here and there, not being out late) but since moving into her dorm 30 minutes away from home she’s been exploring her new found freedoms. I am glad she can have more freedom to go where she wants without her parents breathing down her back but there have been times where she’s been out with her friends (all girls) and she doesn’t go back to her dorm til late.

It wasn’t until she moved into school that we started having issues, she started being a little secretive about where she was, what she was doing and who she was with, this set off some red flags but we had some talks, things got heated and she kind of flipped it all on me. Couple of months my mom tells me that she wants to plan a cruise trip this summer and wants my girlfriend to go with, I ask her and she says yes and i ask her parents for permission, they say yes, a couple weeks pass by and she tells that her friends (same group of girls) want to go to the caribbean during that same time so she won’t go with us. I won’t lie i’m a little salty but I try to be supportive, The summer comes around and I stay at her house til it’s time to go (their flight is at 2 am), they go on their trip and she tells me one night that the girls want to go to the club. This sets something off in me and I get upset because I had mentioned to her that I did not feel comfortable with her going to the club without me and it’s not cause i’m jealous someone’s going to hit on her, it’s cause we’re underage and I hear stories of what can happen in pubs/clubs and am concerned for her safety, the next day her friends want to go back to the club and she decides to stay, I thank her for being considerate and then for the next 3 days she goes back to the club. 

Now when she came back home I went to pick her up again, we had a talk and she got upset at me because I was upset she wasn’t listening to me and understanding how uncomfortable I was, I didn’t want her to stay at her AirBnB during the entire vacation but damn they could’ve gone to a restaurant or something on that beautiful island. A couple days pass by and everyday she’s hanging out with those girls, not one day was spent with me after being gone for a 11 days, so I ask to pick her up from work and she tells me her mom wants her home, I go to where her location is and she’s riding a bike with one of her girlfriends and she rides right past me. After an hour we finally sit down and talk and she tells me that she wants to break up because she doesn’t know how to treat me anymore.

I get her to calm down and we work things out but the entire time her friend is trying to drag her away from me when all I wanted was to talk to her.

A couple days go by and we’re chilling doing better and we see this video on tiktok about searching eachothers name in our phones and when you look at her name it’s nothing but nice messages but when i searched my name it’s all of her friends telling her that i’m crazy, manipulative, obsessed and i felt sick dude I really didn’t know where any of this was coming from but it made me think that her friends are feeding into this idea of breaking up because it wasn’t until she started going out late at night with these group of girls and hiding things from me that she started treating me differently and acting cold me with.

There have been times where I have wanted to break up with her because of the shit she put me through and trust me there’s a lot more not mentioned in this post that is insane but regardless I forgave her for her faults and tried to move on but seriously am i the asshole for not letting her just end things when I was trying to look past all of our issues and just forgive eachother?",TL;DR,2024-10-17,"AITA for not letting the relationship end?

No one really likes M that much, he’s generally an ass m, I’ve never really had an issue with him. However, my fiancé tried to introduce himself to M a couple of times and both times he was rude and said “Do I know you?” and “Why are you talking to me?” so my fiancé realllyyyy doesn’t like him. He’s happy to invite my friend, but he is dying on the hill that M is not invited. I really would like to invite my friend but would I be the AH to not invite M as well? None of the friend group she is a part of have significant others, but my fiancé has some friends with significant others coming (who we hang out with more often). I’m quite unsure of wedding etiquette but I’ve been told it would be rude (by multiple people) to not invite him and it would be better to leave her off the guest list all together. My fiancé has also asked his friends and they say the opposite. Please help reddit I don’t know what to do.

82,1g5ei7d,AITA for bringing my degree into work to prove I graduated? ,"I’ll try not to make this too long. I (32M) work in an office where everyone has at least a bachelor’s degree (this is relevant). Most of my coworkers have their degrees framed on the walls of their offices, and some also have pictures of them at their graduations; in fact, I think I’m the only one that doesn’t. I’d rather decorate my walls with pictures of my wife and me on trips we’ve taken. I also didn’t even attend my college graduation (not much for ceremonies), so I don’t have any cap and gown pictures, which has never bothered me. 

Recently a coworker- we’ll call him John- started suggesting I didn’t actually go to college, and lied to get this job. The accusation was so ridiculous that I basically ignored it, but that just seemed to convince him more. He started saying dumb stuff like “must be nice to have gotten this job without doing any real work”, “I wish I could’ve gotten this job without student loans”, and “if you’d gone to college like the rest of us, you’d understand”. I tried ignoring him, thinking he probably just wanted to start drama, but eventually I could sense our other coworkers beginning to think John might be right since I wasn’t really disputing it. I figured I’d just bring in my damn degree and put an end to it. 

Now, here’s the thing: I did really well in school, enough that I graduated with a “first class honors”, which my diploma says. I’ve never mentioned this to anyone at work because it didn’t feel that important- the degree itself is what matters. However, when I brought my diploma in, my coworkers really focused on the “first class honors” thing. I kinda became the hotshot of the office that day, which was weird. My boss insisted I add it to my wall, saying it “looked good for the company”. My coworkers then began teasing John about the whole thing, pointing out that HIS degree doesn’t say anything about honors, and saying it was a dumb accusation. Now John is pissed off and calling me an AH, saying I made him look bad with the whole “honors” thing, and saying I could’ve found some other way to prove I graduated without bringing in the degree.

83,1g5ec30,AITA for refusing to hangout with my girlfriend’s friends on my vacation ,"
So I (m21) am going to visit my girlfriend (f20) in Prague as she goes to college out there. Little context before my girlfriend’s old friends never liked me in general even before I met them they have disliked me and with being so widely disliked even before meeting them it definitely took a toll on my social skills and made it difficult to even try to have a conversation with them. Well today I was on the phone with my girlfriend talking about the trip which I have already fully payed for including flights, air bnb, etc. while on the phone she brought up how she couldn’t wait for me to meet her new friends when I come visit. I’ve talked to her new friends a couple times on the phone with me mostly staying quiet and they have already began to diss me to my face so I’m not really excited to meet them. Anyways I told her how I would be more than willing to meet them but am not sure how it’ll go. She said that i should try my best to make it go over well as we would be hanging out with them a lot while I’m there. To me this trip was about spending quality one on one time with my partner so I was kind of shocked. I told her if she wanted to hangout with them while I’m there she is more than welcome to but I’m not sure I would like too. This made her super upset saying how she needs to show her friends the same reasons she likes me and that it’s important too her. I’m just not sure I would like to use my vacation time and money to hangout with her friends instead of enjoying my time.

84,1g5e72p,AITA for not paying my sister back when she wants?,"About 3-4 years ago, my family and I faced financial challenges with our cellular plan, leading me to port our lines to a new carrier due to an unaffordable bill. This resulted in an outstanding debt of about $2,000, which has been on my family member's credit report for a couple of years. Recently, she received a settlement offer from the debt collector, asking us to split the amount, with a deadline set for the day before my child's birthday.

I expressed early on that the timeline wasn't feasible for me, especially given our tight financial situation this past year. Although I never refused to pay, her lack of alternative solutions made the situation more challenging. Over the past week, she has repeatedly brought up what I owe her in a rude manner. On top of that, when I asked her for $80 to help cover our current phone bill, she told me not to request money from her without notice and flatly refused.

In addition to this, I've been paying the phone bill myself since we switched carriers, and I've already contributed far more than the initial debt amount for her line and devices. I've also been using her DD account for supplemental income, which she has now cut off. This loss has significantly affected my finances, and after I confronted her about her comments regarding the debt, tensions escalated.

86,1g5e4v2,AITA for fighting with my husband because I think he is too cheap?,"I’m struggling with something in my relationship and would love some outside perspective. My husband is great at saving and investing (he’s really good at it and studies a lot on the topic). However, sometimes I feel like he takes frugality to the extreme, and it causes tension between us.

For example, he’s perfectly content eating rice and chicken most days, and he doesn’t feel the need to go out much—he’s genuinely happy being at home. While I respect that, it feels like he’s scared of spending money, and when he does spend, he makes a point of talking about it, which can get on my nerves.

A recent fight we had was over a bicycle. I wanted to buy a brand new one that cost around €350, but we fought for two weeks because he thought it was unnecessary. He kept saying a used bike for €50-€70 would do the job just fine. Eventually, he did buy me the new bike, but only because he found some coupons and got a good discount.

I appreciate the fact that he bought it in the end, but I feel frustrated that every purchase turns into a negotiation and debate. It makes me wonder if I’m being unreasonable or if this dynamic is unhealthy.

So, AITA for fighting with him over this? Am I being too harsh, or is it fair to expect a little more flexibility from him when it comes to spending?

I remember frantically packing before my trip, so when I left my bed was definitely not made and my dirty laundry was scattered around, yet my bed was made and my laundry was washed and folded in the hamper when I got back. That’s when Mia told me that she let her friend Brian (23M) live in my room while I was away. She told me that Brian had been living at his uncle's place, but she offered to let him live in my room while I was gone because it was closer to his work. 

I was shocked. At no point did she or Brian ask or tell me that he was living in my room while I was away. It wasn't like I was unreachable either- I had a phone plan while I was abroad and Mia would often text and call me. She even called me to tell me that she got a job offer out of state and that we would need to find someone to take over her end of the lease. There was no reason as to why she or Brian (who has my number) couldn't have asked me while I was away. Not only did she let him live in my room without my permission, but she let him live here for free while I was still responsible for my half of rent and utilities. She said that in exchange for letting him stay for free, she had him cook, do laundry, and clean the apartment, and even had him take care of my cat when she went out of town. She said he could stay as long as he left my room “better than he found it”.

Also, Brian is my roommate’s friend, not mine. He and his girlfriend (who I never met before) came over a few days after I got back and they BOTH thanked me for letting him stay, and that’s when I found out his gf had also stayed the night with him in my room. The thought of him alone living in my room made me uncomfortable, but knowing they both slept there together makes me feel like they violated my space. They bring it up every time they see me now, and it makes me so uncomfortable. 

I am very blessed and grateful that my parents support me financially while I am in school, so I don’t pay for rent myself, but I still feel that I should ask him to pay for the costs during the time he was living in my room. My friends think he should have to pay, but my mom told me not to ask for the money and make it a big deal, even tho she thinks it was wrong of them to do that. I still feel horrible that they had to pay for the rent, electricity, wifi, and water that he was using while I was gone. He has a paying job and was living rent-free at his uncle’s, so I don’t understand why my parents have to pay for his time there. I am really torn since it seems hypocritical of me to ask him for rent when I don’t pay it myself. So, WIBTA?

90,1g64do7,AITA for keeping a gift my ex-boyfriend got for me? ,"It’s been over a month since I broke up with my ex-boyfriend (M25), and honestly, it’s been a rollercoaster. He moved to another state just weeks before we ended things, and the distance seemed to amplify the issues we already had.

For context: I (F23) broke up with him due to his controlling and jealous behavior. We were only together for a few months, but it felt intense, probably because we knew he was moving, and we were trying to make long-distance work. Once he moved, things got worse—every time I went out, he accused me of flirting with other guys. He had shown this behavior before he moved, especially when alcohol was involved, but the distance made it unbearable. Still, he wasn’t all bad. He was generous, paying for nice dinners and giving me gifts, like flowers and a camera I’d wanted for a while.

Now, it’s been over a month since we’ve spoken. I packed up and shipped him the last of his things—a suitcase and a few small items he left. He hadn’t asked for them, but I thought it was the right thing to do. Yesterday, out of nowhere, he texted me and asked for the camera back—the one he gave me as a gift.

When we were together, I had mentioned wanting a camera, and he happened to have the exact one I was looking for. He told me he never used it, so he gave it to me. Since then, I’ve been using it regularly and love it. To me, it was a gift.

When he asked for it back, I agreed because I didn’t want to cause drama. I also asked if he’d received the other items, but his response was a flat “yes,” no thank you. I started browsing for a replacement camera, only to find it’s sold out everywhere, with used versions on eBay going for $500 to $800. So, I texted him again, offering to buy it from him, but he replied, “No, sorry.” I tried one more time, offering to Venmo him $500, but he said, “Just send me the camera. I only gave it to you because you wanted one.”

At this point, I realized this wasn’t about the camera—he doesn’t need it. He’s in a better financial position than I am and could buy a new one. I think he just wants to take it away from me.

I’m torn. Some friends say I should keep the camera because it was a gift, while others think I should send it back because I agreed to, and I broke up with him. I’ve grown attached to it, but I did say I’d return it.

93,1g63rjm,AITA for “not following through” on the rent to own agreement I had with my brother?,"My (F33) brother (M39) is an outgoing, likable guy. 

But, sticking to things (whether it’s a job or a relationship) long-term isn’t his thing.

Last spring, my husband and I purchased acreage where we wanted to build our new home. The question came up as to what we would do with our current home. We decided to rent instead of immediately sell. My brother and his new, third wife made the pitch to move in and “rent to own.” The conversation started over dinner with my parents and, admittedly, we let my parents’ advocacy for my brother sway our decision. They realized this was the only chance my brother had to own something so they pushed.

At the time, my brother had a full-time job at a phone carrier and had also been given an AMAZING deal by his old boss to purchase the DJ company he worked nights for - the guy was moving, offered to sell the business for just the cost of the equipment financed out of his own pocket. Bro’s cell phone job had benefits, and the DJ company was a multimillion dollar business, so my husband and I made the mistake of hoping that this time my brother would take advantage of his perfect storm of opportunity.

We agreed to let him rent the house for the cost of our current mortgage (easily a thousand less per month than we could rent it for) and give him 18 months to build up his business and credit and purchase from us then. We agreed to take the total of his “rent” as his down payment. We agreed any improvements/maintenance would come out of his budget, just as if he already owned the house, but we would give him credit toward the purchase price for anything he put into the place.

Starting at the second month he lived there, rent was late. Then he decided to scrap his full-time job because the DJ company made enough money - problem is, he quit paying his former boss the monthly payments, didn’t bother following up on existing accounts or generating new accounts, just showed up to the already booked gigs like he did when he was just an employee. A bunch of the equipment got “stolen” and he couldn’t replace it because he canceled the insurance to save money.  Bro and his wife did nothing to maintain the house, we were constantly getting calls to handle lawn care, tiny stuff broken, complaints that we took the mower and snow blower with us, on and on. His response to repeated requests for rent payment was to say we could just add it to what he would buy the house for later.

It’s been 18 months and bro has less income, worse credit, and has treated our house like crap. We told him we’re just going to forget about the missed payments, but he needs to move out and the purchase of the house is off the table.

94,1g62pmc,AITA My Part time contract job wants me to spend alot of time doing social events outside of hours and its leading to conflict,"I’m an independent contractor in creative design and marketing, juggling multiple contracts. Recently, I took on a part-time marketing manager role at 24 hours a week, with in-office days on Tuesdays and Thursdays and a remote day on Mondays. It seemed like a good fit since I work my other contracts on Wednesdays and Fridays, and focus on art commissions and teaching on weekends. Before accepting the role, I was clear with the hiring manager that I could only work during those specified hours because of my other commitments. The hiring manager agreed to these terms.

It’s important to note that this job pays significantly less than the typical salary for a marketing manager in my city, about a third of the standard rate. I took it out of necessity at the time, but I was mindful about setting clear boundaries upfront.

Soon after starting, there were tasks that extended beyond the agreed-upon hours. They’d ask me to work outside of those hours, but I held firm to our arrangement. Despite this, I started getting calls, emails, and texts on my non-work days, and I eventually stopped responding to reinforce my availability limits.

They’ve also invited me to social outings during work hours, which I had to decline due to my celiac disease—it’s tough for me to eat out safely. I’ve also turned down invites to events outside of work hours due to other commitments. Lately, there have been more requests for me to attend holiday events, award ceremonies, and client gatherings outside of my work schedule. When I declined an invite to a Saturday event, my boss made a pointed comment: “It seems like you don’t want to hang out with us,” which felt like a jab given my previous refusals.

I feel stressed because it seems like they expect me to participate in these social events, even though it’s not part of our agreement and I genuinely don’t have the time or interest. I’ve decided to move on from this role at the end of the year and focus on remote contracts. It feels like they’re looking for someone with the flexibility and commitment of a full-time employee, but I’m balancing four contracts to make a living and pursue my passion for art.

98,1g61i88,AITA for refusing to go out with our dog wearing a fake service dog harness?,"
My (19M) brother (17M) and dad (57M) wanted to go out to the pub together (without our mum because, divorce) because we hadn't done it in a long time as I had been in uni and my brother had been doing random stuff. We wanted to go out with Mike (our family dog, owned and taken care of by my mum though), but the pub doesn't allow dogs unfortunately, so we were gonna leave him at mum's.

Before we left, everyone was already having a fight because my dad was late or my brother was meant to drive us there but forgot or some crap, and overall everyone was in a bit of a bad mood already.

But then, my brother and mum mention something they did recently and it makes them laugh and they want to show me. I'm interested so I wait for my brother to come back, and he comes back holding a (tacky, cheap) dog harness with the words ""SERVICE DOG"" printed on it. He and my mum said it's funny because they can use it to bring Mike to places that don't allow dogs. I'm already very uncomfortable.

Then, my brother's face lights up and he says something like ""We should put it on Mike tonight so we can take him to the pub!"" Basically, we should lie about him being a service dog.

For extra context, Mike is a really well behaved dog - he's a golden retriever, very smart, good natured, and obedient. He loves people and people love him.

But I really didn't like this whole service dog idea. I immediately found it really gross and immoral.

I pretty much said that. My brothers response was that ""no one will know"" because he's so well-behaved, and it hurts no one, it's a ""victimless crime"", and if people know, no one will care anyway because everybody loves Mike.

I still think it's wrong. My brother gets very cross and starts calling me names (""r***rd, pussy, etc), and says a bunch of stuff about how I'm always like this. I look at my mum for backup and she just sympathetically says something to the effect of ""Oh, go on, it doesn't really matter"".

At that point, my dad rings me to ask where we are. I tell him what's happening and he says it's ""victimless"" and ""no one will know"", but when I respond he just says over and over ""I get it, I understand, no no, I get it, fair enough, alright"", and it's hard to explain, but it's the voice he uses when someone is being a bit insane and he's just trying to appease them.

I say I don't want to go out if they're gonna make Mike wear that thing. My brother says he doesn't want to go with me anyway because I'm a pussy and I ruined it, and the whole thing is just called off.

Although I am completely solid in my opinion about that stupid harness, especially as a disabled person myself, I can't help but feel like I ruined it?

Now, here’s the thing. Max was the name of our childhood dog. I’m talking about the family golden retriever we had for 12 years, who passed away when I was 17. Max was a good dog, but a dog. The moment she said the name, I thought she was joking, but she was dead serious.

Everyone else was giving these awkward smiles, but I couldn’t help myself. I blurted out, “Are you really naming your kid after a dog?” My sister looked shocked, and I could tell I embarrassed her, but I tried to explain it’s just weird to name a baby after a pet. She got super defensive and said, “Max was part of the family, and the name means a lot to me.” I get it — we all loved Max, but I just don’t think it’s a good idea to give a kid the same name.

Things got tense, and she basically accused me of ruining her name reveal and disrespecting her choice. She stormed off, and now my mom is saying I owe her an apology. But I feel like I’m just looking out for my nephew.

However, when I asked her what she wanted to study, I found out she wants to do the same as me (psychology). I have a dream university since I was 9, and she then told me that she wants to go there.

He got upset, saying I'm selfish and greedy because I'm successful. He made snide comments about doctors making a lot of money. When he said ""What's a few thousand dollars to you?"" I told him my bank account isn't a piggy bank for family members.

I explained it's about principle - fairness and consistency in my practice. Waiving fees for family would mess that up. It wouldn't be fair to my other patients who pay full price.

To be honest, my brother-in-law's family is struggling financially, and it's hard to see them dealing with that. But I still can't justify giving them free treatment.

My wife agrees with me, but she's really torn up about the whole thing. She's sad that her brother's being so critical and that it's causing tension between us. It's taking a toll on her, and that bothers me more than his entitlement. I'm frustrated he's dragging her into this.

To make things worse, even my in-laws are chiming in. My mother-in-law and father-in-law keep telling me I'm being unfair and that family should come first. They say I should ""help out"" since we're financially stable. But I don't think that's reasonable.

103,1g5zg39,AITA for wanting my fiancé to settle on her wedding dream?,"My fiancé and I are having major issues choosing a venue. We found one in July that we both liked (Place A), but my fiancé didn't fall in love like she wanted to. We agreed to keep looking until 9/15, and then if we hadn't found a place by then, we would go with Place A. This was her idea.

We got into a big argument after we visited all the venues on our list (on 10/5 - past the deadline, but I didn’t make a stink). We visited that last place and it didn't take the lead, so we decided to go ahead and book Place A. We ask for their updated availabilities and they have a Friday in July or some Sundays in October. We agree on the Friday in July together. Then she talks with her mom, and her mom tells her that she doesn't think July is a good idea because it will be too hot, so my fiancé changes her tune and says that she now wants to do the Sunday in October. I was confused, because we had already made this agreement, and fought to keep the July date. My ultimate position was that, at the end of the day, if you want October, then that has to be what we do, but I'm going to make my case for July. I didn't say those words explicitly until that became the argument, but that's where I was coming from. She didn't see it that way. She saw it as me not letting her have the wedding she wanted. In the course of this argument, she says that she feels like she's being pushed into Place A altogether, that she shouldn't have to settle for anything less than a place that she loves. Eventually we settle on the Sunday in October, with the question now shifting to whether she agrees to Place A at all.

Then she found another place (Place B) she wants to look at, which we had already reached out to once before. I was not high on Place B because they were one of the most expensive options we had looked at. I voiced my concern with the prices of what we’d already seen. She said if they're over $50K then that'll be the end of it, Place B will be out. $50K was not a figure we had ever discussed before. We got them back and Sundays in October came out to a total cost of $49,026. Now she wants to go visit. I said I don't want to because this is way higher than anything I was comfortable with. She says I don't care about her happiness, she only gets married once, she should be able to have it be perfect. Of note, she's a resident and becomes an attending doctor next year and will be making a lot more money. She says that she'll pay for it all and that I'm just being cheap. I say it doesn't matter who's paying for it, using that money for the wedding has a major effect on our shared life together. I'm of the mind that if we can get 90% of the way to her dream for a fraction of the cost (Place A would be $19K), then we have a lot of good places we could be putting those savings.

Then she found another place (Place B) she wants to look at, which we had already reached out to once before. I was not high on Place B because they were one of the most expensive options we had looked at. I voiced my concern with the prices of what we’d already seen. She said if they're over $50K then that'll be the end of it, Place B will be out. $50K was not a figure we had ever discussed before. We got them back and Sundays in October came out to a total cost of $49,026. Now she wants to go visit. I said I don't want to because this is way higher than anything I was comfortable with. She says I don't care about her happiness, she only gets married once, she should be able to have it be perfect. Of note, she's a resident and becomes an attending doctor next year and will be making a lot more money. She says that she'll pay for it all and that I'm just being cheap. I say it doesn't matter who's paying for it, using that money for the wedding has a major effect on our shared life together. I'm of the mind that if we can get 90% of the way to her dream for a fraction of the cost (Place A would be $19K), then we have a lot of good places we could be putting those savings. But I get shouted down and told that I'm not supporting her. I'm just so drained at this point trying to fight for what would still be a beautiful wedding and being made to feel the villain for it.",0.0,0.08641791343688965,0,1
104,1g5z62g,AITA for ignoring my coworker after she kept talking over me,"I (19F) have been working with my coworker (25F) for 2-ish years. We go to school together (college courses) and hang out outside of work. We have never argued or got into a fight before, but I have been holding back some things that have been bothering me. She has the tendency to cut me off when I am talking at work and would often ignore me as well. For example, I’ll be talking about something that happened the prior day or a random story to my other coworkers, and mid talking she will cut me off and talk about herself or something along those lines. Now I wouldn’t be upset if she cut me off to ask about clarification or to add to the conversation, but she just starts a whole new one. If I am talking to her about something, she also just blatantly ignores me and will either be on her phone, or I would have to repeat myself in order for her to respond. I personally find it very irritating and disrespectful. I remember a coworker commented about her cutting people off and she basically just laughed it off. 

So here’s where I might be the asshole:
She ended up cutting me off 3 times in one conversation and I just had enough and I stopped talking. I basically didn’t start and conversations with her and when she would speak to our other coworkers, I just stayed on my phone or caught on on schoolwork. She noticed and asked what’s wrong but I just said nothing. I could’ve told her what was wrong, but I didn’t want to make it a big deal and put her on blast in front of our other coworkers. I wish she had the same morals. The next day when we had downtime, she turned to me in front of everyone and went “Okay I’m sick of you acting like this what’s wrong with you; Why are you ignoring me?” and so I told her “I’m sick of you interrupting me and ignoring me when I’m talking.” She rolled her eyes and snapped back “Oh my god this is what you’re ignoring me about, what are we 5” To keep peace in the workplace I just said “Yeah seems like it” and turned away from her. I have not talked to her since and unfollowed her on all my socials. I personally don’t want to associate myself with someone who can be so disrespectful and when we talk about it, downplay how I feel and don’t take any accountability. Granted I could’ve been the bigger person and talk about it instead of ignoring her, but I’m working on my communication skills and I personally don’t like confrontation. I just feel like my feelings were pushed aside and I was embarrassed that instead of talking to me in the break room or alone, she interrogated me in front of everyone.
