0,1g5nfig,AITA for accidentally revealing to my trans friend's gf that her gf's trans,"So I have this friend called Mary. She's AMAB and has been struggling with her identity ever since she was young. Around a year ago she met this girl called Emma(fake names) and Emma knows Mary is hiding something and promised she'd wait for Mary to say it. Around a week ago we had a school festival and Mary and Emma were together walking around. I haven't met Emma before so I assumed she was a friend of Mary's. I saw her walking by herself an hour later so I approached her with my friends. We talked for a while and after finding out she's been friends with Mary for a while I stupidly asked ""Are you a boy too?"" as a joke. Emma was shocked and my friend told me to stop because it was obvious Emma didn't know. I kept going and called Mary by he/him pronouns and Emma looked disgusted by us and eventually pieced together what we meant. Mary was eavesdropping on us, the thing is she's been building up her courage to tell Emma her secret and thought Emma would be accepting, but that shattered all her hopes. Mary started getting a panic attack and ran away apologising for not telling Emma. Ever since that happened Mary has been isolating herself and cut off contact with everyone.
