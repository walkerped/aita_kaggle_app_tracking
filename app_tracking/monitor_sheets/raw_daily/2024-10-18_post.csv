0,1g6gmwx,AITA for betraying my old friends?,"I, F(15), moved in another country end of last year, This year, I was in a class without my friends. This girl, Cleo befriended me. I'd hang out with her and another girl, Yammy. One day, I asked Yammy if I could use her markers and she said sure, but Cleo didn't let me use them when it's not even hers. Keep in mind, we were doing a worksheet which was optional. I was like, alright I don't need the markers. But then, Cleo pointed to a nearby table which had some color pencils. The color pencils, well, they looked really old, they weren't sharpened, dusty, and short. I said no. She started forcing me to use them. And then said ""Hey, op, do you want to fail? Do you not care about your future? Go, take those pencils."" That time I started to slowly distance myself. Suddenly I saw her and Yammy picking on a girl in my class. They were bullying her, calling her names and throwing stuffs at her. I got scared of being their next target so I sat with them. But I didn't trust them.

I started dating this trans girl, Rein. They found out abt it and the fact I'm pansexual. They started shit-talking abt me. Like once I moved my head and Yammy was like ""why she moving her head like that, is she possessed?"". Cleo said, ""No, it's cuz she gay"". Anyways they did more, don't remember. I am the smart kid in class, I always answer qustions. Cleo told me to stop talking. I had enough of them so I just started ignoring them. They were devastated. But then they started picking on me. They made fun of me, stalked my accounts, always stared at me and called me gay f\*g. I'd ignore them. Soon I was dumped by Rein, and Cleo started bothering me about it.

Then a new girl came in, Lia. Cleo befriended her too and they all shit-talked me together. I despised Lia for that ngl. But now there's this another new girl, Sana, they befriended her too. Yesterday during Japanese class, she sat with me. She was genuinely interested to be my friend and I was so looking up to today. But today when I came to school. I found Cleo telling her something and Sana said ""That's not bullying, that's the truth..."". And Cleo said ""She's a spider"". I once dressed up as a spider for an event and they made fun of me before. But Sana hasn't really laughed/made fun of me/shit-talked me. And now I've realized something. Cleo is telling Lia and Sana a story where I'm the villain. But...it's not a lie. I dunno if I despise Lia anymore as honestly, if my bsf told me she hates someone cuz they left her w/o explanation, I'd hate them too. What they (Cleo and Yammy) are telling them (Lia and Sana) is that we were friends but I betrayed them and left them. I'm kinda sad cause Sana really seemed like an amazing potential friend and I wouldn't have to be alone in classes and really wish she knew my side of the story. 

And now it got me wondering. Why does so many people hate me? Am I in the wrong for ditching them with no explanation?
