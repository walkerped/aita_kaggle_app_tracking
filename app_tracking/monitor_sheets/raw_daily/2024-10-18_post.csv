0,1g6gmwx,AITA for betraying my old friends?,"I, F(15), moved in another country end of last year, This year, I was in a class without my friends. This girl, Cleo befriended me. I'd hang out with her and another girl, Yammy. One day, I asked Yammy if I could use her markers and she said sure, but Cleo didn't let me use them when it's not even hers. Keep in mind, we were doing a worksheet which was optional. I was like, alright I don't need the markers. But then, Cleo pointed to a nearby table which had some color pencils. The color pencils, well, they looked really old, they weren't sharpened, dusty, and short. I said no. She started forcing me to use them. And then said ""Hey, op, do you want to fail? Do you not care about your future? Go, take those pencils."" That time I started to slowly distance myself. Suddenly I saw her and Yammy picking on a girl in my class. They were bullying her, calling her names and throwing stuffs at her. I got scared of being their next target so I sat with them. But I didn't trust them.

I started dating this trans girl, Rein. They found out abt it and the fact I'm pansexual. They started shit-talking abt me. Like once I moved my head and Yammy was like ""why she moving her head like that, is she possessed?"". Cleo said, ""No, it's cuz she gay"". Anyways they did more, don't remember. I am the smart kid in class, I always answer qustions. Cleo told me to stop talking. I had enough of them so I just started ignoring them. They were devastated. But then they started picking on me. They made fun of me, stalked my accounts, always stared at me and called me gay f\*g. I'd ignore them. Soon I was dumped by Rein, and Cleo started bothering me about it.

Then a new girl came in, Lia. Cleo befriended her too and they all shit-talked me together. I despised Lia for that ngl. But now there's this another new girl, Sana, they befriended her too. Yesterday during Japanese class, she sat with me. She was genuinely interested to be my friend and I was so looking up to today. But today when I came to school. I found Cleo telling her something and Sana said ""That's not bullying, that's the truth..."". And Cleo said ""She's a spider"". I once dressed up as a spider for an event and they made fun of me before. But Sana hasn't really laughed/made fun of me/shit-talked me. And now I've realized something. Cleo is telling Lia and Sana a story where I'm the villain. But...it's not a lie. I dunno if I despise Lia anymore as honestly, if my bsf told me she hates someone cuz they left her w/o explanation, I'd hate them too. What they (Cleo and Yammy) are telling them (Lia and Sana) is that we were friends but I betrayed them and left them. I'm kinda sad cause Sana really seemed like an amazing potential friend and I wouldn't have to be alone in classes and really wish she knew my side of the story. 

And now it got me wondering. Why does so many people hate me? Am I in the wrong for ditching them with no explanation?

1,1g6qkhy,AITA for blaming my dad and stepmother for my stepsiblings thinking they would get a grandkid inheritance? ,"My dad and stepmother got married when I (17f) was 7 and my brother (19m) was 9. My stepmother had two kids of her own who were 2 and 4 at the time. Our other parents are dead. Their dad and my mom. Their dad died while my stepmother was pregnant. My mom died 19 months before dad remarried. The only extended family my brother and I had was our mom's side and when dad remarried he insisted my stepsiblings had to be included or they couldn't see us. Grandparents rights were not available at the time so my grandparents agreed but they made it clear to dad they were only including our steps because they loved us and wanted to see us.

So whenever we saw our grandparents, my stepsiblings did, and they grew really attached despite my grandparents never feeling any different. My stepsiblings were a way to see my brother and me, not more grandkids or family in any way to my grandparents. It was the same for the rest of my extended family. They were treated fine but they were never loved or wanted.

Grandpa died in 2020 and my grandma died a month ago. Grandpa's funeral was done over zoom but grandma's wasn't. My stepmother tried to send my stepsiblings up to the grandkid section at the funeral but an aunt and uncle stepped in and said it was only for grandkids. After the (non religious) service each grandkid got our ""grandkid inheritance"" which was a lovingly made memory book that our grandparents did for us and had entries up until the day before grandma died.

My stepsiblings got nothing. 

This devastated them and there has been an atmosphere ever since. My dad and stepmother are furious and went crazy on my aunts and uncles about letting it happen. Then my dad told me I needed to show some sibling love and loyalty and take a stand against my extended family but I refused. My dad told me that wasn't okay and that I could not be so selfish. My stepmother said I owed it to my stepsiblings. I told them none of this was my fault and I would not turn away from my family over it. They said I was by choosing my extended family. I told them they are my family. I will not push them away. They said it was cruel what they let happen. I said it was their (dad and stepmother's) fault in the first place. I told my stepmother she knew my grandparents only included her kids because they wanted to see me and my brother and that dad had made them do it. I said they should never have let the kids believe they were grandkids to my grandparents. They were the cruel ones knowing my family had never loved the kids. And I said I would not stand against my family over this.

They flipped over me blaming them and they said my brother and I lacked empathy and compassion like our extended family did.

2,1g6q76f,AITA for telling my mum I don’t like her boyfriend? ,"Okay, so this could be a long post, but I’ll try keep it to the factual elements so it’s not too lengthy. I’ve been debating posting here, but after spending hours reading posts, I’d like to get internet strangers opinion on whether I’m doing the right thing. 

I, 25F, live in the UK. I had a very dysfunctional family growing up, my parents stayed married until I was 16 but they did not get along. My dad worked an awful lot to provide for us, and my mum worked during our school hours then looked after us, but she was very dependent on us to meet her emotional needs, which in turn has caused a lot of issues in me and my siblings now we are adults. My mum walked out on numerous occasions, and would often throw around empty threats. Childrens services were called on her by my therapist when I was a teen as a concern of emotional abuse due to her behaviour. Anyways, that’s some background. 

Fast forward to when I was 17/18 and the family home divided, I stayed with my mum as she was severely mentally unwell and I thought leaving her own her own would be the breaking point for her. We lived in quite a remote area and there wasn’t that much there. I myself was in an abusive relationship myself, but when things were good he was my only respite I had so I didn’t leave (my own fault, I have learnt my lesson now). Bear in mind my mum knew this, but she encouraged me to stay in the relationship. My mum became my best friend, although looking back on this now I think she was using me as emotional co-dependency after my parents divorce. She would promise me things like a house deposit when I moved out so I could set myself up and get a mortgage, and said she put me in her will as 40% beneficiary and my three siblings as 20% even though I told her not to do that as it wasn’t fair. 

Things became increasingly toxic with my family relationships, and my mum was becoming more and more unpredictable, as was my relationship. I made the decision to move to a city about an hour and a half away, I had very little money but I had a job offer and some friends there and I needed to get away from it all. I sat down and spoke to my mum about it and was honest with her that it was all becoming too overwhelming for me and I was struggling to cope. I promised I’d visit her and she could come stay as much as she wanted. I visited her probably once every 4-6 weeks, she visited me 3 times over 4 years. During this time of me being away, she would only make contact with me when she didn’t have a boyfriend. She took absolutely no interest in my life even though I’d call her at least once a week to see how she was and ask about work etc. She would tell me about her day / week, then say she had to go without even asking how I am. I found this really hard as I felt like I was being the parent.

About 2.5 years ago, she started seeing another guy who we have known as a family for a long time. He has a bad rep for drug use and alcoholism. Within the first 9 months of them dating, I had seen him sniffing when he had his child (who he got to see once or twice a month), he had started an argument with my ex (who I was on civil terms with), and he had also started on my friend at the time and trashed his bathroom when they visited, before cracking open a can of beer at 8am the next morning when they left for home instead of spending any time with me except for 4 hours the night before. I told her about my dislike to this and concern about his behavioural impact on her. 

Mid last year, he got arrested for drug/drink driving as he drove under the influence, rolled his car which had his child in it, and then lost his licence. I found out through social media, so I phoned her and said do you really think all of this behaviour is acceptable? And I also expressed to her how she’d made no effort with me over the last 18 months, how she hadn’t seen me unless I went to her and everytime I did he was there, and that he was just not a nice person to be around, he reminded me of my abusive ex, who although I was on civil terms with, I didn’t want to be around that behaviour again. She basically told me it wasn’t anything to do with me and I just can’t see her then as he is with him. 

She did help me out a lot, she helped me out with some money here and there when I moved as I was struggling, however I did have to get a credit card when I split with my ex as he left me in a bad position and drained any savings I had and I was on the verge of being homeless. I have been relying on the money she promised me for a deposit for a flat / house or to help me clear my debts but I don’t want any relationship with her to simply seem transactional as tbh I’d rather not have the money if it means having an abusive relationship with a parent. I’m really struggling financially now and trying to get out of the pit I was in but I just don’t think the emotional turmoil is worth forcing a relationship. 

I feel like maybe along the way I’ve let her down as me moving away might’ve pushed her into the situation she is in now with this partner, but I just don’t know if it I should be blaming myself?

Me (23 f) and my bf (25 m) have been dating for 5 years now. We have a 11 month old son J. Last year we had a fallout with my bfs family over his stepdad accusing me of being a bad mum for not handing my infant of to him and his wife (both frequent smokers) my baby was a preemie so I was really careful. While I would have been fine with them holding him at the time we visited and at the last visits we had before that, he was always fussy hinds why i didn’t hand him off then… his stepdad screamed at me and my bf and we left. Ever since I haven’t seen him, just his mum my bf visited once or twice when he was there too. All I ever wanted was an apology and things would have gotten back to normal. He refused tho. Well now to the whole story. Me and my bf talked about his mums bday and Christmas this year and when I asked him what we would do about the whole stepdad situation he said in a snarky tone that he would most likely just spend Christmas there alone since I wouldn’t want to see the stepdad. I got upset because I wanted to spend Christmas with him not by myself… he just basically said he didn’t care about my feelings on that matter and if I was still butthurt it was my own problem to deal with it. Now I got really frustrated and asked him if my feelings don’t matter to him at all and if he really just doesn’t care he just gaslit me and left the house annoyed. Now I’m sitting here. The situation is not over for me. I feel unheard. Every time we have an argument he just runs off and comes back hours later like nothing happened. It makes me so mad because it leaves me in such a bad situation and cracks on my mental health. Am I crazy? Is there something I’m missing here? I’m thinking about taking the baby and just leave like he did. When I call him he ignores my calls. What would happen if I gave him the same treatment? Would he understand my frustration? It just drives me nuts… Reddit help me WIBTA?

Edit: He has no clue about feelings… that’s why he said it so bluntly. He himself has no feelings, he always feels neutral… he is never really happy, excited, anxious, sad, angry (like screaming match angry), he can get upset for sure but not in the common way of people being upset… he can’t even be mad for more then like 5 min.

He himself has no feelings, he always feels neutral… he is never really happy, excited, anxious, sad, angry (like screaming match angry), he can get upset for sure but not in the common way of people being upset… he can’t even be mad for more then like 5 min. He has a lot of autistic traits and has severe ADHD. I also do have ADHD.",0.0,-0.002663959050551057,0,1
6,1g6pksk,AITA for telling my friend to suck it up when she got in trouble at work for constant tardiness?,"I (28f) briefly stayed with a friend (25f) and her family. She has ADHD, anxiety, and depression and I understand her struggles since I also have them. Thing is, I'm trying to work with my mental health. She does not. No therapy, no meds, no other alternatives.

She got her first ever job and she's late to work about 3 out of 5 shifts. She blames it on traffic and her adhd. She refuses to leave earlier and doesn't let her coworkers know she's running late. She had an emergency with one of her pets, causing her to be 30 minutes late, and she refused to call her work.

Anyways... she got into trouble at her work. She's upset and says it's not her fault. Then she got even more upset that I'm not taking her side despite also having the same mental health struggles.

I reminded her that I'd be more sympathetic if she made an attempt to leave on time, like when someone reminded her of time. I also told her I learned to leave early because I was in band, despite having ADHD. (And yes, I tend to struggle with my jobs due to ADHD before people tell me I'm an ableist or something.)

I left my friend sulking and crying over the fact I'm not babying her like her mom does.

7,1g6p5nm,WIBTA for asking my neighbor not to talk to me through my bedroom window?,"I (23M) have really bad social anxiety, and I recently moved into a new apartment where my bedroom window directly faces the stairway and landing that leads to the doors to my neighbor's and my apartments. Naturally, this leads to me being able to see everyone that comes by since my desk is right in front of the window.

I'm generally someone who enjoys having a private space, so I spend a lot of time in my room with the window open so the air doesn't get too hot/stale. This, obviously, puts me at risk of being right by my neighbor (30-something F)'s path in and out of her apartment. Every time she passes by me while I'm at my computer, she says hello to me through my window into my private space, which... is not one of my favorite things, especially when I've been in a lab class for a solid 7 hours and don't want to talk to anyone once I get home. 

I've mentioned it to my roommates and they also think it's quite weird, but none of us really know how to go about making it stop; I'm not super confrontational so I feel weird about telling her straight-up that it makes me uncomfortable, but just ignoring her and hoping she gets the message also doesn't feel like the optimal response. I also considered putting a note on my window but I have some reservations about that.

8,1g6p0g4,AITA for not wearing my wedding ring the majority of the time?,"My husband and I got married a little over a year ago and recently welcomed our first baby. Before the baby came, I wore my ring 24/7. It is a beautiful ring with a high prong setting, and he is really proud of himself for picking out something I love so much on his own. 

Now that we have the baby, the ring is in the way of daily life. In the first couple of weeks, it scratched the baby which was my primary motivation for not wearing it. On top of that, it catches on everything when I lift the baby from laying down. It doesn’t fit past the car seat area where the latch is for releasing the seat from the base, so I have to either take it off just to do that or cross my arms awkwardly to pull the release that is behind the to of her seat using my right hand while grabbing the seat handle with my left (the seat is behind the driver door).

I was worried I would lose it taking it off so much in unusual places, so I mostly stopped wearing it. I try to remember to wear it when we go out as a family, by sometimes I forgot. Usually I don’t wear it when I go out alone because of the car seat issue.  

My husband surprised me with a chain necklace so I could put the ring on that instead…except the baby grabs at the necklace anytime I wear it nearly breaking it. I suggested to my husband I could get a flat wedding band for now, but he is against that. He doesn’t want me to get used to wearing that in place then not wear the nice ring anymore. He tells me that other women have babies all the time and continue wearing their wedding rings 24/7, so I need to figure it out.  

I plan to continue wearing the ring when we’re out of the infant stage, but it’s a nuisance right now. This really bothers him, and he’s even accused me of trying to look single. I’ve explained the issues to him and he still has a problem with me not wearing it.

Some back story is necessary. I (25F) have been working at this location for a while now. My manager, (late 30s F) has had a problem with me pretty much since I started. She had no say in hiring me, and after a few months, began making racial comments towards me, spreading rumors about me, etc. Earlier this month, I was able to prove that one of the reports that she filed against me on behalf of another employee that claimed I was bullying this employee was completely false. I went up to this employee and apologized since I had no idea he felt this way. He was completely confused. Turns out that my manager made up everything on the report. I have no idea what repercussions she faced for this, if any, but since then, she has literally not said a single word to me. It's been over a month. I will greet everyone, I will try to inform her of work related things, but she will not acknowledge me. It's to the point that instead of saying ""excuse me"" to get me to move, she'll just use her gut to push me.

 Yeah, I'm leaving this job, today was my last day.

So I work in several departments. I was helping with another and she ran in freaking out because the boss's daughter had called 911 because they thought he was having a heart attack. The daughter put my manager on the phone so the daughter could check on her father while my manager relayed info. My manager went back up front so she could use the front phone which has better connection.

I went up to the front, told my manager and she totally ignored me. Didn't acknowledge me. Nothing I did, she acknowledged. So I told her, ""I'm going to assume you heard me,"" went to the back and kept working.

While I was working and I thought I was alone, I grumbled ""That's so frustrating."" Another coworker who was walking by the room and asked me to elaborate. Then, the manager of the department I was currently working in suddenly ducked out of another room and began railing into me for ""making the situation about myself"" and ""being mean"" and that I needed to get back to work even though I was working and to calm down. I kept working and said I was calm. Then she got in my face and in a mocking tone said, ""You sound like this, I AM CALM, I AM CALM.""

She must have told everyone in that department about this. Most of them are related, and all of them have lived together at some point. Up to today, they're all rude and avoidant of me.

12,1g6o38j,AITA for telling my brother to quit his job and look after the family?,"(Extended reupload from the r/AITAH subreddit under same title)

The title already looks AH material, so let me explain. I (28F) have an older brother (30M). My brother, younger sister (14F) and our parents (51F, 62M) live together in our childhood home in our home country while I live and work abroad. For context, where I’m from it’s the normal way of life for children to continue living with their parents well into adulthood and even after marriage in the case of sons. Nursing homes aren’t a thing here because children are expected to continue to look after and provide for their aging parents.

In short, my parents have been struggling with chronic health issues relating to their progressing age and other factors, so they have finally quit their jobs and gone into retirement to focus on their health. However, recently, after many long-needed doctors’ check-ups and examinations, we learned that our parents’ health situation was much worse than expected.

In the end, to make sure our parents were being properly taken care my brother and I agreed that they needed additional assistance, because for the most part they were alone at home while he was at work and my sister at boarding school. However, this was when our thoughts began to diverge. I suggested finding actual health specialists and trained people we could hire as in-home caretakers since health was the focus and me nor my brother were well-versed in that area. However, my brother began to insinuate that I return from abroad and put my career on hold to take care of our parents in this time of need and he would keep working to cover any bills. I laughed at first and said “So you want me to quit my job?” jokingly, but when he stayed silent I realized he was being serious.

I earn much, much more than my brother. He earns a very high salary in our country, but because I work a job overseas, my salary just becomes gigantic when converted to our local currency. It would honestly be a stupid financial decision for me to quit my job while he continued his much lower-paying one, and I told him this. However, he, or perhaps his male pride and ego, persisted and he remained adamant that a family member should take care of our parents, not strangers.

I told him if he wanted a member of our family to take care of our parents so bad, that he should quit his job and I could provide and cover bills. He was seriously offended and completely refused the idea, despite him suggesting literally the same to me just a minute ago. Later, I went ahead asking relatives with healthcare connections for credible specialists and caretakers, and keep in frequent contact with my parents to see if they like the services and feel okay. My parents were initially on my side and agreed I shouldn't quit my job, confused why it would even be considered, but they were appalled and said I went too far in suggesting the same to him.

13,1g6nonv,AITA for attending party where my ex will be there?,"EDIT: should say for NOT attending the party.

Background: after YEARS of dealing with my ex-wife's antics, I no longer have to, as my kids are now adults. This woman made my life literal HELL. I remarried about 2 years after divorcing, and you can guess how that went over.  This woman cheated MANY times, but expected me to always be waiting in the wings. When my kids were in school, she tried to exclude me from their records, even putting her current BF name as other parent.  I found out by chance and visited the principal with a copy of my divorce papers and that was quickly rectified. My wife had to file harassment reports against her because she has NO respect for boundaries. The only reason she doesnt have a criminal background is because my wife didnt want it to affect the kids so didnt press charges.  She used to drive by our house at different times of night.  Drove by my wife's job when she worked on the other side of town herself.  Call and harass me over the stupidest of things, yelling and screaming. The list goes on.  And now that I do not have to interact with this woman, I do not want to be in the same room as her.  She even went as far as to cause a rift in my relationship with my son that took years to repair.  We are now on good term and my health is now in a better place because I no longer have the stress of the myriad of situations with her.

Which brings me to my issue.  I have a 10 y/o grandchild, and my son invites everyone to his birthday parties every year.  Obviously, my ex attends, and she tries her hardest to interact with me. I want absolutely NOTHING to do with this woman.  I dont cause a scene, but I refuse to talk to her, and I will NOT act like nothing ever happened and be 'friends' with her.  But she is all about appearances, and doesnt stop when I refuse to engage. I want my son to have something for my grandchild with just US, and no longer attend these birthday parties.

Which brings me to my issue.  I have a 10 y/o grandchild, and my son invites everyone to his birthday parties every year.  Obviously, my ex attends, and she tries her hardest to interact with me. I want absolutely NOTHING to do with this woman.  I dont cause a scene, but I refuse to talk to her, and I will NOT act like nothing ever happened and be 'friends' with her.  But she is all about appearances, and doesnt stop when I refuse to engage. I want my son to have something for my grandchild with just US, and no longer attend these birthday parties.  My wife thinks I should just suck it up once a year because she said it isnt about me, its for my granchild.

So, lay it on me, Redditors, AITA for not wanting to attend my grandchild's party and have a seperate celebration?",0.0,0.033125847578048706,0,1
14,1g6nefw,AITA when I got mad at my „friend“ after she drank my drink without asking?,"English is not my first language so I‘m sorry if I make some mistakes. I‘ve known this girl (let‘s call her Sarah) for about 3 years now because my (ex-) best friend (let‘s call her Jane) introduced us when she got into the same class as her. Sarah was at first very shy and never really said much but was very friendly. After some time she always asked some of our group friends if they could buy her something (including me), we never got money back nor did she ever buy us anything. I‘m also more on the shyer side and no one really saw me ever as an angry person. When I and Jane fought because she never asked me to hangout nor did she ever try to make plans with me but only with the other people of the group. Me and the whole group didn‘t talk for almost a year, we solved our problems and I thought everything is fine. Sarah also has a problem with stealing crushes and boyfriends and that problem has she with the whole group except me because I think she was too scared of me (I‘m 2 years older than her). I have mental health problems but I never told that anyone of the group since I never had any problems with that when I was with them. Now to the part why I‘m making this. I had a very shit*y day yesterday and was crying all day so I asked Jane and Sarah if they want to hang out because they were near my house thinking I could get into a better mood. We went to a supermarket to get some snacks but Sarah didn‘t had money with her as always so she asked me to buy her something (I havent seen her in a long time nor do I hang out with her alone we only text each other) I said yes since I havent had an issue with that because I feel generous with people I‘m friends with. I paid for the both of us about 10$ she didn‘t even say thank you and we just walked out of the supermarket. I wanted to open my food and asked her if she could hold my drink since Jane opened her snack at the time (I can‘t buy this drink anywhere else so I don‘t get it often. Mind you she had a bigger bottle than me and already drank half of it). When I started opening my snack I heard the click when you open a can, as I looked over to her I saw her drinking my drink. I got really angry and sad and just didn’t know what to say (I have a compulsive order and I need to open every can when I buy it for myself with a specific rhythm and I have to get the first sip). She just looked at me and didn’t even say sorry. I said I still have some work to do and didn‘t want to ruin the mood since I was angry and sad I just left and cried on my way home. Both of them think I‘m being overly childish, yes I might’ve acted a bit too much but I told them I had a bad day and cried much. I told another friend of out group (she also has a small problem because of a boy with Sarah) and she thinks I have every right to be angry at her and knows how I feel.

15,1g6ndfn,AITA? Argument with my boyfriend?,"I'm (24f) currently at odds with Jake (24m) over this and I need some other perspectives. Throwaway and fake names.

Jake and I went to the beach last weekend because we wanted to go while it was still hot. I bought this new swimsuit and I thought it would be perfect for me because it would hide my insecurities. 
For a quick explanation, basically I have a lot of stretch marks on my body, especially my thighs and hips, from growing. I have always hated them and found them disgusting so when I first found them I stopped wearing anything that would show them (shorts, crop tops, ect). 

Anyways Jake had told me that it hid everything fine and that nobody would see them. I believed him and I wore it. However after an hour or so I noticed them and realized that they were actually noticeable. Admittedly I ended up having a breakdown and we had to go home. When we got home I asked him why he didn't tell me they were visible and he said he didn't notice them. I knew he was lying and asked why he would let me embarrass myself like that and he said that ""they're not a big deal"" and that ""nobody would actually care if they saw them."" There was some more back and forth between us but that was the main gist. 

I'm struggling to talk to him now because I feel so ashamed. It took me so long to even show him these so why would he think it's okay to just let me walk out like that in public?

I fell asleep before my laundry finished in the dryer and I accidentaly slept until 12pm. I realize that this is kind of asshole behavior on my end, however I think what my roommate did was also not great.

When I got up, I rushed to get my laundry but when I looked there were pillow cases and other stuff that wasnt mine mixed into the dryer with my stuff and everything was damp. So I let the dryer run and I went back to my room confused on why they wouldn't just take my stuff out or something and then I heard them come back and check the laundry.

They went back to their room so I went to go see if the laundry was done, and they had put my clothes on the sofa, now dry. I am very grateful that they took the time to do that, however, I don't know what kind of detergent or other products they use in their own laundry and I have severe eczema and can't use anything with perfumes or strong chemicals.

I wrote up a note and these are the exact words: ""Thank you for moving my laundry. I fell asleep before I could get it & I slept in late. In the future, please don't combine laundry because i'm allergic to a lot of products. Thank you :)""

I told my boyfriend (18M) about the situation and he said I should not have left a note to her and that I should just learn that this is what she will do if I forget my laundry.

17,1g6msbg,AITA for my wife being stranded at the dealership? ,"I (28m) and my wife Lucy (27f) were getting in our car this morning to commute to work (Please note I have my own truck but it was left at work the night prior as she picked me up for a family dinner) and as we started the car it struggled to turn on. I immediately called the dealership and an appointment to get it looked at in about 45 minutes. 
My wife HATES going to the dealership service appointments by herself and has voiced this several times. Our initial plan was to drop off our daughter at school, have her take me to work and then she would go into her office for work. I suggested dropping off our daughter and then going to my office so I could get my truck, follow her to the dealership and then take her to work so she didn’t go alone and wouldn’t be late waiting for the dealership shuttle to take her to work. She said no. she said no and that should would stick to the original plan and then go to the dealership and take a shuttle to work.
After dropping off our daughter I again offered to accompany her to the dealership and take her to work after and she again said no. She said “I’m already going to be late for work, I don’t want you to be late as well for no reason. And I don’t trust your truck to get there and take me to work.” My truck is old and beat up but runs fine enough. I also work for a family business and it would honestly not have been a big deal at all to call the owner and be 30 minutes to an hour late. I finally conceded and let her do what she felt was best and went into work after being dropped off.  
About 20 minutes later I’m getting a wave of texts about how she’s upset, she shouldn’t be there alone, the sales guys are being pushy, they want her to get new tires and are pilling up the costs pretty quick.  I tried to talk to her and just tell her to refer them to call me but she tells me that makes her feel stupid which I can understand. But she is MAD at me because she is there alone. 
I texted her that because SHE is the one who made the call to count me out she can’t be upset with me over not being there as I offered to be there several times. I told her I feel like she would have been upset if I went and was late or she would have been upset if I didn’t go and that it feels like she set me up to fail. She didn’t like that at all and was furious I would suggest she was playing games. We stopped texting.
She then texted me she was upset because she was essentially stranded there while waiting for a shuttle as there was a line of people in front of her. I offered to leave work to go take her to work and again she refused. 
She then ignored any calls or texts and is still doing so. I even had to message her on her twitter account to be sure she was okay after I got an alert that there was an accident near the dealership and I was worried about her. She responded with curt messages and when I said “sorry just wanted to be sure you were okay. I’ll leave you alone.” She responded with “please do”.

18,1g6mqkx,AITA for telling my husband to get an XL seat on our flight?,"So my husband (34M) and I (30F) recently went on  
an international trip. On the flight there, I had the middle seat, and he had the aisle seat. Pretty quickly, I became super uncomfortable because he was taking up a lot of space—his arm and leg kept spilling over into my seat. I asked him multiple times if he could move over a bit (at first I thought he was manspreading), but he snapped back, “What do you want me to do about it?” He said he couldn’t move anymore and I understood that there’s limited space, so I asked him if he could switch seats with me so I could have some room at least for a little bit, but he said he wanted it because he likes the freedom to get up whenever he wants.

I then suggested that maybe for our return flight, he should consider getting an XL seat (which was only about $15 more). This would give him more room and would make both of us more comfortable for another 7 hour flight. He got super defensive and offended, assuming I was calling him fat. I explained that I didn’t think that at all—he’s tall and stocky, and even tall athletes like basketball players need more room sometimes. It wasn’t about his weight, it was about the fact that he was taking up space on my seat. He refused to consider it and was upset with me for the rest of the flight and when we got to our hotel. I realized at the hotel that the flight wasn’t full so I could have just moved to a different seat and I felt really stupid for not doing so. I did have a lot of anxiety during the flight so I guess that’s why I didn’t think of it. But yeah, I felt responsible for my own discomfort and didn’t want to ruin our trip, so I dropped it hoping things would be better on the return flight. 

They weren’t better. The window seat next to me was full, and the plane was packed. I couldn’t move seats, and I spent the entire flight uncomfortable, feeling squished, and visibly annoyed that my husband didn’t switch to an XL seat for the return flight when he had the chance.

The topic turned towards cheating and the general consensus was that we all believe cheating is wrong. However, if one of us were to cheat we’d still cover for them with their wives, girlfriends, partners, etc. Except me, I said if you guys decided to cheat then keep my name out the situation. 

I’m not your alibi, confidant, or excuse when you go out and do that. My reasoning is that is ruins my character whenever it blows up in their face. Imagine if you found out your partner was cheating and everyone was keeping it secret, you’d feel betrayed and untrusting of everyone around you. That’s my reasoning, I’m trying to protect my integrity and trustworthiness. 

Most of them didn’t like that. They said stuff about the Bro-Code and having each others back.

20,1g6mj25,AITA for letting a misunderstanding with my cousin drag on for years?,"In 2019, I (22F) met a guy through an international charity organization I’m part of. Let’s call him Steve (26M). We started chatting casually on Facebook, and that summer, I told him I’d be visiting family in Chicago. He suggested we meet up, but made it clear he didn’t want to date anyone from the organization, which was fine with me because I wasn’t interested in dating either.

When I arrived in Chicago, I visited a friend from the organization, Camilla. I mentioned that Steve was picking me up, and her whole vibe changed. She told me that she thought Steve was seeing someone and warned me not to flirt with him. I reassured her that wasn’t the case. Steve picked me up, and we drove around, grabbed some snacks, and talked for a couple of hours before I went back to my aunt’s house, where I was staying.

A few days later, I got sick. Steve texted me asking to hang out again, but I told him I couldn’t because I had a fever. He still dropped by for 15 minutes just to check in on me, then left.

When I got home from my trip, I got an angry message from Steve. Apparently, my 17-year-old cousin Bryan had told one of Steve’s friends to stop talking to me. Steve was furious, accusing me of telling people about us—though we were literally just friends. I brushed it off and didn’t respond.

That’s when things got weird. My cousins, including Louisa, who I grew up with, started acting strange around me. Louisa was particularly cold. I thought she was mad because I got a bigger room than her on a family trip to Texas, but it turns out, she was dating Steve. Camilla had told her she saw me getting into Steve’s car in Chicago, and Louisa assumed we were dating. Instead of confronting me, she just distanced herself and has been holding a grudge ever since. She told everyone except me that I was dating her boyfriend.

Honestly, I get why she was mad, but I don’t understand why she never talked to me about it. Nothing happened between me and Steve, but Louisa never gave me a chance to explain. We still don’t talk to this day, and I’m not sure if I should reach out to clear things up.

When I got home from my trip, I got an angry message from Steve. Apparently, my 17-year-old cousin Bryan had told one of Steve’s friends to stop talking to me. Steve was furious, accusing me of telling people about us—though we were literally just friends. I brushed it off and didn’t respond.

That’s when things got weird. My cousins, including Louisa, who I grew up with, started acting strange around me. Louisa was particularly cold. I thought she was mad because I got a bigger room than her on a family trip to Texas, but it turns out, she was dating Steve. Camilla had told her she saw me getting into Steve’s car in Chicago, and Louisa assumed we were dating. Instead of confronting me, she just distanced herself and has been holding a grudge ever since. She told everyone except me that I was dating her boyfriend.

Honestly, I get why she was mad, but I don’t understand why she never talked to me about it. Nothing happened between me and Steve, but Louisa never gave me a chance to explain. We still don’t talk to this day, and I’m not sure if I should reach out to clear things up. On one hand, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong, but on the other, it feels weird to let this drag on for years.

21,1g6md8r,AITA for not making my wife apologize to my SIL in order to end a decade long feud?,"About 15 years ago my (46m) wife (46f) were having a birthday party for our daughter. My brother (48m) and SIL (38f) just started dating and SIL showed up in a revealing outfit. I feel like normally this wouldn't be much of an issue but my wife was going through post partum at the time and this really seemed to get on her nerves. She didn't say anything but a few weeks later they stopped by to drop off some Christmas gifts. My wife went to the bathroom and didn't come out until they left to avoid SIL. This started the feud between wife and SIL.  
  
A short time later my brother was talking on the phone with our mother (75f). Our family is from southeast asia but my brother and I were raised in north america. SIL is from our home country but studying here as a foreign student when they met. Over the phone my mother warned my brother to be careful dating girls from our home country because many come here with the intention of getting into a relationship and using guys. Unfortunately my mother wasn't aware that SIL was listening on the conversation the whole time and was outraged. This started the feud between my mother and SIL.  
  
Soon after that they got eloped and had my nephew. SIL then banned my brother and nephew from seeing us. To try and work things out my brother got my mother to write an apology email to SIL explaining that her warning wasn't personal since she didn't know SIL well. This allowed them to come and have dinner with my mother for her birthday. They came by to pick up my mother and take her to dinner but my mother was under the impression that the whole family would have dinner together. SIL refused due to the feud with my wife and my mother refused to have dinner separately so they left.  
  
Since then, for over a decade now we've had limited contact with them. We'll see my brother and nephew maybe once every few years when my brother can sneak my nephew over but eventually she found out so now SIL has banned nephew from seeing us at all. They say that we can end this by having my wife apologize to SIL to end the feud. I feel like if she doesn't want to see us that's fine but banning my brother and nephew from seeing us over these feuds is ridiculous.  
  
There were a few times when my nephew was a baby and toddler where they needed us to look after him for a few days even though we were banned from seeing him. I always felt that was a pretty big gesture of goodwill towards ending the feud but SIL always considered it a favor to my brother and not her so she still wants an apology.

Upon looking around and not finding too many reliable options, one of my best friends from high school 24M, offered a place for roughly 900 and that started early May 2024. At the time, seemed like a reasonable deal, especially with us being pushed for time and having a deadline of early June of 2024.

The house is owned by his gf 24F, and they have been living there for a little over a year. In early May, we went to go visit the house with just my friend being there. Upon arrival, the house was a complete mess, which was a surprise to me because my friend has always been clean in the past where he'd been living at. It was promised to be clean upon us moving in, which like we said was going to be early June, the only problem with that was that we didn't have a solid date due to some problems with the current place she was living at. We decided to still proceed with the move on the promise of it being clean by the time we move in.
On June 6th when I'm moving in, i'm settling in but the house was not clean at all even after almost an entire month. I gave slack for the first few days thinking maybe it was just a lot for them and they were taking their time. I unfortunately couldn't have been more wrong.

A few days in, there were already spirts about the environment, even after being told they'd get it clean on their own time. On top of that, we were told that they didn't have enough time and that we moved in too soon even after telling them an ETA.

Time goes by and this situation does not get any better even if it is cleaned up, it goes right back to the chaos it was in. Daily routine is food left out from the previous day not fully eaten and just left, clothes in the bathroom floor. Cluttered counter tops and tables in every room and no space in the living room to relax due to all the random junk. The garage has clothes boxes scattered inside and piles of clothes just left to rot after sitting for WEEKS. My point has been that it is fair for us to be able to use the proper facilities, which is something that we never got.

She's slightly bigger than me weight wise, and slightly shorter, but she isn't fat. I myself am pretty muscular and fit and so is she, since we both do martial arts.
 
Lately, when we'd be hanging out and she'd see pictures of our girl friends on her insta feed, she'd often tell me how she wished her body looked like theirs and how jealous she was (She's genuinely absolutely stunning by the way, I just can't make her see that). I myself am not very confident in my looks (typical teen stuff) but I've never felt that way towards my friends. She's also had a past with the whole jealousy thing, I do better than her in school (which means absolutely nothing about what type of person you are imo but I digress) and her mom often compares her to me. I think because of this she always tries to remind me of things she is better at, if I call her out, it's a joke but if I do the same I'm 'putting her down'

A few days ago we were at school scrolling on TikTok and she kept making fun of a video she found, comparing the guys style (terrible btw) in the video to mine and laughing. I told her that at least I haven't worn the same pants for a month (petty and childish I know, but I thought we were joking around and I didn't mean it seriously) and she immediately got mad and refused to talk to me for the whole day.

Today I got some new clothes I felt amazing in and sent her some pictures of me showing it off. She left me on seen and replied after a while, immediately saying I made her have a breakdown and that she got jealous because she didn't have as many clothes as me or my body, bringing the other day up aswell. I called her out and said I didn't want to think twice if she'd get mad about something I said or sent and that it made me uncomfortable. I tried my best not to invalidate her feelings, but that we should talk this out, she refused. I told her that she wasn't the only one that got upset sometimes, but I'd always swallow it down because she always brought up the ""but you have a better body/get better grades"" ect.

My teenage daughters have been in a dance school for 7-8 years.  My husband (51) and I (51F) have become friends with several of the parents, but we don't get to socialize often. 
Last week we all went out for a celebratory dinner. The kids sat at one table and adults at another.  I was seated across from 2-3 people that we don't get to talk to often, even though we've known them for several years.  One woman has a heavy Slavic accent and functional, though not proficient, English skills.  

After conversing a while about our kids, I asked her where she was from. My husband gasped and thwacked me on the arm. She said, ""Pittsburg."" Then after a beat, she laughed nervously and said, ""A long long time ago I came from Russia."" It was clear that she wasn't really comfortable talking about it, so I didn't ask any more questions. 
Later, on the car ride home, my husband mentioned the inappropriate question. I asked him why he thought it was inappropriate, and he said it was classist/racist. This started a HUGE argument, with yelling and him talking over me and not allowing me to even discuss my thoughts.  (This is NOT typical for him). I said that asking a POC where they were from when they clearly are American would be racist, but she was white and clearly not American. He said that I have no way of knowing about her background.  She could have lived in America her whole life and learned English from her Russian grandmother.  I reminded him that I have degrees in linguistics and communication disorders, and I know when phonology (accent) crystalizes, and I know language acquisition. Based on my knowledge and my observation of her English skills, she is very very unlikely to be American.  Then he said that I was throwing around my ""white woman's education.""

I wasn't his problem. I was still really sick at the time so some extended family told me I had imagined it. But a few months later when I was healthy he came out and said it in front of everyone at a family dinner over something mom bought him but she bought it a week too late or something because my asthma medication had to be paid for the week he wanted it originally.

He'd get mad if I did something fun while he and mom spent time together doing something fun. Especially if it was with our shared grandparents or an aunt/uncle.

At the 8 week mark last Friday (Oct 11th) I get an email at 6pm EST (an hour after office closing) that my degree had be rejected.

27,1g6kzjn,"AITA: Why was I not ""good enough"" for my ex's wealthy family?","After a 2.5-year relationship, including 1 year of living together, my ex-girlfriend decided to end things. Just 3 weeks ago, I went on vacation for the first time with her family and my ex. She comes from a wealthy background, while I come from a small village. Her father was a pilot, her mother a flight attendant—just like my ex. Their conversations often revolved around their success, accompanied by an air of superiority, as if they had the ""perfect"" family. But I knew that wasn’t the case, having overheard frequent arguments within their household.

During the trip, I encountered passive-aggressive remarks, like comments about how “a beard isn’t neat,” or disdainful responses when I asked if there was mayonnaise in the fridge: “Mayonnaise, that’s disgusting.” At one point, her mother even threw a tantrum because we wanted to book a different return flight. I felt that no matter what I did, it was never good enough, and her parents never bothered to ask how I was doing. Whenever I brought something up, there was always zero interest.

Throughout our relationship, I supported my ex through everything—helping her with work, attending two therapy sessions with her to address past traumas—but I often felt criticized for lacking ambition or not sharing the same vision for the future as she did. When I finally opened up about my feelings toward her parents, she saw it as an attack. I was really upset about that because, throughout our entire relationship, I have always accepted her for who she is. I never judge others for their choices. While my family had always treated her with kindness, I never felt the same warmth from hers.

Eventually, when I reflected on everything from a distance and discussed it with my parents, I asked my ex ""I have the feeling that I was never the ideal son-in-law from the beginning"". She replied 'yes' and then began to cry and after that saw it again as an attack to her family. I couldn't help but wonder: Why wasn’t I good enough for a family like that? Her decision to end the relationship came as a surprise to me, and the same for my friends, Even some of my friends' girlfriends reached out to offer their support. When she tried to explain, she mentioned something about ""norms and values,"" but refused to elaborate, saying it would get too emotional.

Every time it’s my turn to host, my siblings and even my parents seem to come up with last-minute excuses to skip. The last time I prepared a full meal, my sister canceled an hour before because she “wasn’t feeling well,” and my brother had “work stuff.” I spent hours prepping and even made special dishes that everyone usually loves.

Now, my turn is coming up again, and I don’t feel like going through all the effort when no one ever shows up.

31,1g6kfyi,AITA for letting my dog sniff a stationary scooter-man?,"I (35F, human) was walking my dog (10F, border collie) on Friday night. We were walking down a well-lit main road, on our way home. As we walked, we began to approach a middle aged man who was standing on the footpath ahead of us with an electric scooter. He watched us walk toward him and remained stationary. Zero scooting occured. 

For some odd reason, my dog is especially reactive to electric scooters. I made sure I had her tight on the leash as soon as I saw the scooter. As we approached the man, I said something along the lines of ""Hey mate, she might sniff your scooter as we walk past because she's usually a little bit scared of them"". The man didn't respond, and stared blankly at me.

As we got closer, he seemed fine and did not move or say anything. Because the footpath wasn't overly wide, my dog got close enough to sniff the man's feet and scooter. Notably, I still had her on a tight leash because I didn't know the man and we were next to a busy road.

As we walked by and the dog started sniffing, the man said, very quietly, ""I'm usually scared of them"". 
As SOON as I heard what he said I pulled my dog back and started apologising profusely. 
The dog didn't react to any of this at all, and was super happy to keep walking. Her and I walked away as fast as we could. 

The whole thing occured over about 20 seconds. My dog is well behaved and friendly orherwise (outside her weird hatred for electric scooters). The man with the scooter was about 50yo and 6ft tall... He didn't seem bothered by the interaction, and didn't move or say anything afterwards. 

When I got home, I mentioned what had happened to my partner (38M). He told me that I am an irresponsible dog owner, and that I should always take a wide berth around strangers. 
I feel that I did my due diligence by talking to the man before we approached him on the footpath. I had full control of the dog at all times, and removed her as soon as I felt scooter-man was potentially  comfortable. Though, I'm doubting myself now, especially after my partner has said I'm TA. 

So, reddit, tell me... Am I a bad dog owner? AITA?

I (33M) have a very specific hobby: I love volleyball. I’m always playing, watching games both live ando n TV, studying tatics. I’ve even took a course to be a referee. There’s nothing is this world I love more than playing VB. Not even food, sex, sleeping, traveling, nothing. It’s defitinely my top choice everyday, everytime.

Now, I’ve been in a 9 months relationship with my bf (26M). At the beginning, I was very excited to introduce him to my hobby. I took him to watch me play, to watch and cheer at live professional games and even to watch me coach a local team and win a medal. I introduced him to all my VB friends and explained the rules so he could understand the game better.

He “liked” the atmosphere of the professional games (5k people cheering and chanting, it’s awesome) but he didn’t like to watch me play, cause it was too boring and he was alone for 2+ hours. So I decided to compromisse. I would not play on the weekends we would see each Other, but would Rather play at week days, at night, when we were not together. He plays violin at our state Orchestra some week nights, and I would skip VB to see him play. That was fine to me: I could have my sport, but my BF would come first, so he wouldn’t feel less importante in my life.

However, things have gotten complicated cause everytime I say I’m going to play VB, he gives the silente treatment and Only responds with one syllab words. I keep asking what’s going on, and he says he can’t understand how can I like something so Much, more than any Other Thing, including sex. I do like being intimate with him, but I do get more pleasure at the court. I told him it’s nothing personal to him, it has been like this and Always will. However, there’s enough place in my life to acomodate them both. It shouldn’t be one or another.

I don’t know if he thinks I’ll flirt with guys at the games, or if I’ll abandon him at home to go play. But it bothers me to know that my BF has a problem with a healthy hobby, that doesn’t interfere at all in our relationship, and Only brings me joy. Is he jealous at how I feel playing? I don’t know what to think and would love to understand more, but he won’t tell me.

For some reason she grabbed my hand and said 'I'm sorry' and I just said it back awkwardly? Then walking in the hallway she was like 'my gf is Russian and pretty and she laughed at u' obviously she had talked about me behind my back as well. I was weirded out and told my friend about it (i literally ONLY have one friend). She somehow heard about it from one of her friends and emailed me telling me to not spread rumors? Oh and the other day I was reading crime and punishment at library and she was talking to her friends and was like 'crime and punishment is over rated, I like white nights' ...like what..? I assumed it was about me, cuz I mean... who really wouldn't? Maybe it was a coincidence, but her friends all read fantasy... sooooo?

But ya. She messaged me on the 16th through gmail and called me pathetic for 'spreading rumors' and 'thinking the Dostoevsky thing was about me' 

I feel like these AITA stories always just victimise the OP. I do see her side, but I was weirded out by the fact she had to tell me her gf was Russian..?",0.0,0.036757782101631165,0,1

36,1g6ivzs,WIBTA For Not Reaching Out to My Half-Sister Who is Having Health Issues?,"I (35F) have an older half-sister (45F) from our dad's first marriage.  Both of us grew up with our mothers and lived states away from one another.  I would see her once a year when our dad would take me with him to visit her.  Between the short, infrequent visits and the age difference, the two of us never got close.  We didn't dislike each other or anything, though.  We just were never ""like sisters"" the way my dad wanted us to be, which was honestly fine.

About 10 years ago, I ended up moving a lot closer to where she lived and made a go at trying to build a relationship with her and her family.  A few visits, some days out, etc.  But we had grown into very different people.  She is very guns, God, and glory of America, and I'm a liberal cat-mom living with an unmarried partner.  Again, we didn't dislike each other.  We just had almost nothing in common.

Our attempt at relationship-building gradually fizzled out.  I last saw her in-person six years ago at a family funeral and we haven't seen each other or called or anything since.  We both are in a group text chain with our dad, and that's the extent of our communication, which is okay with me.  A few memes and dad sending us pictures of the deer in his front yard.  Cool.

Lately my half-sister has been having some health issues.  She slipped on her porch steps and fractured her wrist.  She's now needing surgery for a long-term thing she's been dealing with.  She's having to have a biopsy for a potential cancer.  (I'm getting all of this from our dad.)  And all of that absolutely sucks for her and of course I wish none of it was happening to her - but in the same way I'd wish it wasn't happening to anyone, if that makes sense.

Our dad always wanted us to be closer, but it never happened.  I did text her back when she fell and asked how she was and she said as well as she could be.  And that was the full text conversation.  While it's no defense, I was traveling for work at the time and wasn't giving it that much thought.  I didn't text her after that, nor did she text me again since.

I'm now getting guilted to try to reach out to her again.  ""You should give her a call; she'd love to hear from you.""  ""Have you talked to your sister lately?""  ""Maybe a message or call from you would make her feel a little better.""  

I know sending a text is a small effort, but it’s more than we’ve done for birthdays, holidays, or any other occasion in our entire lives. I’m genuinely unsure she’d even expect to hear from me, and I doubt she’d be upset if I didn’t. That’s just not the relationship we have. Trying to make an effort now feels disingenuous, and I’m conflicted because it wouldn’t be coming from me — it would only be because our dad asked me to. Left to my own devices, I honestly wouldn’t reach out — and I’m almost positive she knows that.

When we were younger things were okay. But then when she was 7 she got bullied by a kid in her class. The bullying didn't last long but afterward she changed. She struggled with her self-esteem and she still feels bad about herself and hates herself and it made our parents really go into protective mode. They let her choose where we got takeout for a month afterward and they cancelled what we had talked about for my birthday party and instead decided we all needed a family vacation instead but she got to pick the location even though we went for my birthday. I didn't have fun. My parents knew I wouldn't like it. They told me she needed this and we needed to help pick her up. They told me I could spend time with friends another day and do something small with them. That never happened even though I asked.

She was still in a bad place after a few months and then my dad went no contact with his mom (grandmother) because she decided she was going to leave ""all her grandkids"" something but my sister, the only granddaughter, wasn't included and she said some nasty stuff about boys being more special to her, in front of my sister. Which did a real fucked up thing to my sister. But it made my parents really go crazy on the ""lets make sure sister gets put first always"". It was more of the same where she got to make decisions for us all. I didn't get the chance to do it ever. And the few times I would make plans with friends but my sister wanted me around my parents would ask me to put her first and cancel the plans. A couple of times I said no but my parents made me cancel anyway. It keeps getting worse too and still happens.

A few months ago I told them that stuff was pushing me away because I felt less important and less cared for by them. I also told them I felt like my sister got to make too many decisions for me. I told them I was so ready to just move away and get away from them and it hurt but it felt like my sister's family instead of mine. They said they were sorry, they told me they'd do better, they'd get my sister a better therapist to help her so we could all move on.

I had plans to go to a Halloween party with friends next week. My sister had plans with friends but after a panic attack they cancelled on her and mocked her about the panic attack. She asked our parents if we could go away that same weekend and spend time as a family. So my parents asked me to cancel plans and go and they tried to apologize but I said forget it, to forget making it up to me because I don't believe them and I'm done. I'll do what they want and I'll suck it up for two more years and I'll walk away because I'm so done. I wouldn't hear my parents out and they got frustrated with me.

40,1g6gmfg,AITA for arguing with my Mom after she cheated and did some awful things to my Dad years ago?,"I'm 19(F), Jason is my older brother (21M) and Ethan is my youngest brother (11M)

This has to do with my Mom (49F) and Dad (52M).

All hell broke loose when she confessed to having an affair a few days after the birth of Ethan.

The reconciliation lasted about 8 months before it blew up. My Mom wanted to focus on the baby first and try to come back to her affair later, but my Dad wanted to do both at the same time. He continued pestering her about it and each time it would start an argument.

The arguments wore down on my mother until she couldn't take it anymore, and she snapped in an awful way. They argued in their bedroom before Jason and I heard our dad scream like a lunatic. She had thrown an alarm clock at his mouth in anger and done permanent damage to his teeth.

(I hope this doesn't violate the rules for violence, I edited out graphic details)

He had to go to dentist multiple times to have his teeth fixed/replaced. He was reduced to drinking from a straw or eating lukewarm soup for a week because if he tried chewing he'd just writhe in pain.

Once it was clear that she was not a threat to us, my Dad initiated a divorce and went for a 50/50 custody. The relationship between Jason, myself and our Mom has been in a weird spot ever since. She didn't take the divorce well and started coping by turning to drinking more often.

She doesn't get drunk often and never when we were in her care, but wine and beer became a common thing in the cart during grocery shopping with her. Neither parents dated anyone else, my Dad was just content with being a co-parent.

Mom still asks me or my siblings if Dad ever mentions getting back out there, and each time it's a no. I feel that she confuses his concern for her drinking habits for romantic feelings.

My Dad loves her, but not that way anymore. He only wants to make sure she doesn't end up like his brother (our uncle) who got addicted to drinking and gambled his savings away before getting himself killed in an accident.

So the last time she asked me, I got mad and chewed her out for it. I told her that it wasn't ever happening and she should be grateful he even let her have custody considering what she did to him.

She broke into hysterics and asked if I was still mad at her for that. Honestly? Yes I was, he didn't deserve to get hurt even if he was being pushy about his feelings.

She asked how long she would have to deal with this anger, she's made an effort to atone for 10 years. She knows what she did was wrong and she regrets it every day. 

I just left her house after I got frustrated. I checked in with Ethan and he says that Mom has been quieter than usual and absent minded as of late. I guess she got what she wanted, since Dad is checking in with her more than usual.

I told her I needed some time to think about it, but I don’t feel comfortable jumping in to help after being excluded for so long.

When I brought up how much it hurt to be left out of all the engagement celebrations, she said she didn’t mean to make me feel that way and that she’s been overwhelmed. I told her I needed some time to think about it, but I don’t feel comfortable jumping in to help after being excluded for so long. Now, some of our mutual friends think I’m being unreasonable and that I should let it go.

Growing up in a Muslim country, where anything outside the norm was harshly judged, made that almost unbearable. I used to be feminine throughout my childhood and teenage years, and my brother, instead of being supportive, made my life hell for it. He mocked everything about me—how I walked, how I talked.

One day at the hammams, a place where men wear nothing but tight underwear, I glanced at a muscular guy walking by. My brother saw it and called me a “whore”—though the word he used in Arabic was far worse. That moment sticks with me, but it wasn’t an isolated incident. He had videos of me, acting feminine, just being myself, and he’d laugh at them with my other siblings. I made it clear how deeply that hurt me, how uncomfortable it made me, but he didn’t care and called me overdramatic.

What messed me up even more was the day I used his PC and found nudes of men. I didn’t understand it at first, but looking back now, it makes everything he did even worse. He mocked me, made me feel ashamed, while secretly hiding his own truth.

Last week, we had a small argument that spiraled out of control. Years of bottled-up frustration came pouring out. I called him out for all the times he made me feel worthless. I told him he had internalized homophobia, and he just sat there, stunned. He denied it all—claimed he never hurt me, never bullied me. He acted offended, as if I was the one in the wrong for accusing him of traumatizing me.

Then, he had the nerve to get defensive, to cry, to insult me for going through his private things. I reminded him that he had no problem showing videos of me acting like a drag queen at 14 to our homophobic brothers. I’d been humiliated, made into a joke, and he still thought he was the victim.

She started handing me girl stuff like nail polish and say “every gay person loves painting their nails”, and I do like painting my nails. It was just the way she said it. But as soon as I start to put the polish on, she took the bottle and yell at me and say “boys don’t put nail polish on!”.

46,1g6eqlb,AITA for not dressing my (21F) niece (5F) in her mom's aesthetic?,"So I'm 21 and recently moved into a new place and out of my college dorm. It's small but cozy and I love it. My young niece who's five years old really wanted to come over and stay with me. We're very close and before, I didn't want to bring her to my dorm surrounded by alcohol and whatnot but now she's really excited to be able to see me whenever. To ""inaugurate"", we had a little housewarming sleepover. The issue is, the next day, we were meant to go to dinner at my mom's place. She hosts these dinners once a month with the whole family i.e all my 4 siblings and their families. The plan was, I'd spend the sleepover and the next day with my niece and I'd take her with me to the dinner so my brother and his wife would get a little time to themselves too. 

My sister-in-law packed a little bag for my niece with the essentials and the outfit she wanted her to wear to the dinner. Everything went smoothly and the next day, my niece and I were doing our fun little grwm but the outfit was weird to say the least. My sister-in-law makes very bold fashion choices and I think she looks great in them but lately, she's been enforcing that fashion on my niece. I mean the tiniest skirts and dresses with large cutouts, crop tops, makeup, the whole shebang. Yes, she even packed a little makeup bag and sent me inspo pics so I could do her makeup. Now I'm not one to overstep parenting but this particular outfit was distasteful for a 5 year old. It was your generic ""ig baddie"" outfit; a leopard print crop top, a micro skirt, knee-high boots with small-ish heels, a leather jacket and my niece looked visibly uncomfortable, pulling and tugging at the material. I thought it was ridiculous that my sister-in-law sent this and even the fact you can find these kinds of clothes for kids. At that point, I just took her shopping to the local store and we picked up a cute kid-friendly outfit she liked. 

All hell broke loose when we got to the dinner though. The rest of our family including my brother (niece's dad) loved her outfit. It was a cute strawberry shortcake sweater with a plaid pinafore dress over it and polka dot tights (probably irrelevant to the story but we were proud of the outfit lol). We even did a cute bubble braid hairstyle and it was appropriate for her age, cute and kept her warm since it's now fall and there was no makeup on her face. The family thought it looked better than what she's been wearing lately but my sister-in-law was seething. I kind of expected it and I felt bad that I overrode her decision but I just didn't want to let my 5-year-old niece out in that outfit that even she was uncomfortable in. She went on a tirade, telling me I'm not the mother so I can't make decisions like this, that I should've stuck to her ""aesthetic"", that my niece looks ""weird"" now.

So my aunt and Tim were together/married for close to a decade. Tim then died. Tim had kids before he met my aunt. They were very small when my aunt and Tim met. Like both under 3 at the time and to the best of my knowledge there was no cheating. He was either divorced or no longer with the mother of his children. He also had primary custody and my aunt adored the kids. But when Tim died the kids went to live with their mother and my aunt never saw them again.

She did try to keep in touch but their mother wouldn't allow her to have contact. My aunt had been pregnant when Tim died but had a miscarriage due to her grief and the stress of losing not only Tim but the kids too.

My aunt has never remarried. She still wears her wedding ring. She still talks about Tim. She talks about the kids a lot too. She has family photos in her house. She tried to look them up a few years ago but couldn't find them and stopped because she figured they might not want to know.

Now my mom and my two sisters have decided they want to surprise my aunt by tracking down the stepkids and bringing them ""home"" for my aunt. I actually took some classes on the best ways to find people and I helped a couple of friends find family members.

50,1g6eeir,AITA for continuing to use a phrase when addressing my kids despite my husband not liking it?,"I (38F) have 4 young kids with my husband (40M). 

They are 5 yrs old, 4 year old twins and a 1 yr old.

Our kids are well behaved in general. Anyone with young kids can confirm sometimes they have tantrums or get upset. Sometimes it's over big things and sometimes it's over something silly. For example our 5 year old was upset this morning because his shoes weren't blue. They've never been blue, they've always been green. Today I guess he just felt like having blue shoes. 

A phrase I use when calming my kids down over smaller issues is ""what's the story, macaroni?"" 

They love when I say this, even when they are fussy or upset. I'm not sure why, but maybe it's just as simple as they think I see them as macaroni. Maybe it's the silliness of it. I can't remember where I heard it. It's effective, helps them work through their emotions so we can work on communicating why we're upset and what can be done to fix it. For those wondering, in my 5 year olds case, the solution was letting him put stickers on his shoes. All is well again lol. 

My husband hates when I say it. He has asked me several times not to say it because to him it sounds too childish. His approach is more strict and he doesn't take the more kid friendly approach. He would tell our 5 year old that his shoes won't turn blue just because he is upset and he shouldn't throw a fit over something he can't change. (This would have upset our son further, not made him stop fussing) 

I feel like sometimes kids have very big and valid feelings but might not know how to express that in a constructive way. I prefer to take the silly approach for these smaller issues. my kids respond positively to it and it works. I don't use it for every situation but on smaller issues I feel it is fine. 

I have tried not to say it around my husband as he doesn't like it. The kids love it and the oldest will sometimes even ask me to say it even if he's not upset so I can't always avoid it even when he is there.

I might be TA because it's clear my husband really doesn't like this phrase

AITA because I haven't stopped saying ""what's the story, Macaroni""? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-18,"AITA for continuing to use a phrase when addressing my kids despite my husband not liking it? I (38F) have 4 young kids with my husband (40M). 

They are 5 yrs old, 4 year old twins and a 1 yr old.

Our kids are well behaved in general. Anyone with young kids can confirm sometimes they have tantrums or get upset. Sometimes it's over big things and sometimes it's over something silly. For example our 5 year old was upset this morning because his shoes weren't blue. They've never been blue, they've always been green. Today I guess he just felt like having blue shoes. 

A phrase I use when calming my kids down over smaller issues is ""what's the story, macaroni?""

51,1g6e6qr,AITA for inviting a friend to a concert with me and my grandparents instead of my stepsister?,"My (paternal) grandparents bought me concert tickets for my 16th birthday a few months ago. They got two for them and two for me and one person I wanted to take. I immediately asked my best friend, who said yes. Like I was still at my grandparents house and I texted my best friend to ask him. He said yes right away. When I got home my mom asked what my grandparents got me for my birthday and I told her and I told her I'd invited my best friend. She went quiet and was like okay. I knew she was being weird but I ignored it. At the time I thought she was annoyed that she and her husband weren't getting the chance to take me instead. 

A month later the tickets came up and my stepsister (15) was asking what tickets and when she heard she said she wanted to go and wanted to know why I was going but not her and I told her my grandparents bought them for my birthday. She told me I should take her. I said I was taking my best friend. She sulked for the rest of the day.

My mom's husband asked me why I had to take my best friend instead of his daughter and I said because it was my choice and I wanted to go with my best friend. He didn't like it either. My mom told me she was hoping I would have changed my mind and invited my ""sister"" (she says sister, but I never do) instead. I told her I had already asked my best friend and I want to go with him. She told me I could want to go with her too. That I could take this chance to actually get close to her because we're running out of time and it's clear as day I don't care about her or care if I ever see her again. She told me I might think that's okay but I'm never getting another sibling and since dad's dead I won't ever get a ""real"" sibling either. She told me I could have a sister though and this could be a nice start and be a way to introduce her to my grandparents. I didn't get to say anything else because mom said she could see from my face that I didn't want to and wasn't open to considering it and she said that was sad and she was disappointed in me because after 8 years of being married to her husband there should be more to my relationships with her husband and his daughter than there is and it's on me, not them, because I never wanted them to be more than those labels. She said I was making my choice and the concert was just a way to wave it in everyone's faces.

I then told my boyfriend straight after and he was curious and saw that it was someone he knew which he then told me to send pictures so he can see due to him being curious (this then led me to think he was interested). 

However, after this my bf goes and says I should be weary of the guy which I fully respect as if he’s not comfortable we won’t proceed with speaking to the guy. However when I ask for why the guy is weird, he then goes on to state examples of traits, but the weird thing was that all his traits he’s stating all match up to people he classifies as his best friend as well as me. 

For instance, he says the guy lies about everything about himself which I also do because I’m quite uncomfortable with my past life. He then states that he’s a complete gossip but then his brother is a really big gossip, as far as when we told his brother something in the past his manager would know (who he speaks to regularly on a daily basis) as well as some of his colleagues. Lastly he said the guy is a massive liar which I also said his best friend is one as well as his sister who have said they would do several things for us but haven’t stuck to their bargain.

They are respectful and they listen to him as an adult in one of their homes (custody is shared so they spend an equal amount of time at both houses) but according to my ex they don't treat their stepdad like he's their parent or another dad.

This has been a source of tension for about 4 years now. My ex's husband wanted us to find a way to share father's day even though the court order says I get father's day and my ex gets mother's day. Her husband feels that he plays a significant enough role to get a piece of the day too. I disagree. My ex wanted to find a compromise but her husband hates being around me so us all being together wouldn't work either. Why does her husband hate being around me? He hates seeing the kids and me together. He said he feels like a nobody, like he's an inanimate object and that he ceases to exist to the kids when I'm around. My ex said he just wishes we could both be equal dads in the kids' eyes but their love goes only to me.

Last year was a particularly tense few days around Father's Day because I had a broken leg and still did something with the kids, which my ex's husband found selfish. He said even ""damaged"" I couldn't let him be dad for a day.

My mom and grandma had a rocky relationship throughout their lives and had lots of bad arguments, so they weren’t in good terms at all but grandma took us in for the sake of me and my education which I’ve always thanked her for. My mom made a few bad decisions in her life and grandma always resented her for those (her marrying my father and fights they had because of him). My grandma used to be an alcoholic ever since my mom was a teen and that never helped their relationship but when we moved in 14 years ago she stopped for good. 


I didn’t have a perfect family growing up, I witnessed fights between my grandma and my mom, grandma blaming my mom for all her wrong doings, I always wanted to come of age, get my degree, move out and live my life away from all that. I met my husband in high school and we moved in together to another city for college and have lived together ever since. 

Fast forward to about a month ago when I was getting everything ready for my wedding, I got the news from my aunt and grandma that both of them would not attend my wedding. I asked why and they told me they got in a fight with my mom, my mom had to move all her stuff from my grandma’s place to her boyfriend (she was living with my grandma on and off to help with chores and cook food). Long story short they asked my mom to take a loan so that they could attend the wedding and give some of that money to my aunt (who doesn’t have a stable income and has been living off my mom and grandma’s money) My mom refused, she works hard for her money and didn’t want to have to pay interest for such a small amount. (I told them both I want them to attend the wedding and that I’d pay for their expenses). 

Their decision came as a shock to me, I was really sad and disappointed that the fights were happening again just as they used to throughout my life at home, and that they had to get in a fight with my mom right before a special moment in my life. I tried to keep my spirits up and didn’t ask my mom what really went on. My grandma and aunt attended only the ceremony but not the evening party.

My mom is the submissive type, even though my grandma treated her like shit all her life she still cared for her.

We became extremely close throughout time. Of course life can get busy so sometimes we wouldn’t be able to talk as much as we wanted, but we would call and text as much as we could. 
Jumping to December of 2023, Rachel met her now boyfriend Noah. When she told me about their relationship, I was really excited for her. As time went on though, it felt like I knew more about their relationship than I needed to. Rachel would constantly be talking about Noah, making it seem like he was becoming her entire personality. It’s like I couldn’t get away from Noah either. She was constantly at his house or just talking about him. I tried to be understanding as this was her first serious relationship and she was super happy. After a bit though it was getting a tad bit annoying. I would try to change the subject or talk to her because I was feeling uncomfortable with how much information I was being told. Even with how much I tried, nothing changed. I pushed it aside after a while due to me being a people pleaser. 

 Fast forward to February of this year. Noah introduced me to my now boyfriend Mack. We started talking and eventually a month later, we started dating. During this time I thought Rachel and I were still on good terms. Apparently not though, cause during March-April I went on a 3 week family vacation, during this time Rachel became more distant with me. Once I got back I tried to talk to her to try and figure out what was going on. Nothing. was. communicated. After a while, I got frustrated that nothing was being communicated, so unfortunately I sent a long nasty text message and blocked her afterwards. Mack and Noah stayed best friends (still are to this day) and I felt awful bad for putting them in an awkward spot. 

 Fast forward to 5 months later in August, I moved in with Mack. After a bit, him and I talked more about the situation. I had already felt guilty for sending the message so I tried apologizing several times before. No response understandably. Mack encouraged me to try one more time. So I texted Rachel apologizing one more time. She did respond saying she is willing to be civil with me, but it would take some time. I understood and apologized again for everything I said and did. I texted her again a couple days later, asking if once she felt ready could we talk some more. I said that I also wanna understand her point of view of what happened. She hasn’t responded yet and I feel like i’m going too far.

Female and my best friend kitty 21 female have been friends for 7 years. We were on and off due to Kitty switching schools. Kitty has done a lot for me. Her dad is a lawyer and she works for him, so she's been able to take me on trips and do a lot for me. She used to complain about her friends never helping her out when she went on these trips and her friends taking advantage of her. I decided that I would never be this friend because I would never want to let someone I admired down. Kitty has maybe had one real job not for that long but she gets paid so much by helping her lawyer dad. While she gets paid this money she buys 10k designer bags. Im not sure where she gets that money but i've known her for a while so i KNOW it's not hers.
She has a lot of designer stuff and her parents fully support her endeavors. When she would take me on trips I would always pay exactly the amount I should so she would think I'm a better friend and a good friend. When she was in front of her friends that she wasn't too fond of, and they would say something she didn't like... ex. ""I love the city but I love the Pennsylvania area"" she would roll her eyes at me like it was an odd thing to say. She did this multiple times in front of other friends, but I would never look back at her. I saw her other friends give in and look back but I would NEVER want to be treated that way so I didn't. I have never tried this hard with other friends but she was someone I looked up to.

Recently, Kitty invited me on this expensive trip and I payed my share for the air bb for 3 days ($100). Spoiler: I didn't stay that long. We had traveled to Miami before but this time it was different. Kitty and her older sister grew up together and have a strong bond. I stayed at this air bnb for one night and we went to nobu. Kitty ended up giving my $60 plate that I was saving for later to a stray cat. This didn't bother me at first... until Kitty and her sister and I were having a conversation. I told them both my cat was having issues and there was an expensive solution but I wanted to save money. They did the thing where they look at each other like I was broke or less than. That set me off.
I kept it in until carbone. We decided to uber to carbone and eat and then they kept doing the thing where they would look at eachother EVERYTIME I said something. It made me insecure and thought I was just being dramatic.
A fee minutes later my mom called me. My mom (not a nice person) started telling me over the phone at this nice restaurant how horrible I am. I ended up crying in the carbone bathroom and throwing up because i felt so horrible about myself that night. I came back to the table wiping. my tears and they all just looked at me like i was stupid. We went back to the air bb and I packed my shit and left the second we got back.

61,1g6cw2v,AITA for not telling my gf about her BMI score that labels her as obese?,"I (M17) am in a 7+ month long relationship with my girlfriend (F16) that lives a 30\~ minute highway drive from me. We met online and clicked instantly and started dating almost right away. Visually she’s a little chubby, and although she's very self conscious about her weight and the way she looks because of it, it’s never been an issue of mine, as I actually think it makes her look cute.

She is a big theatre fan + an actor/singer for her high school drama department. She’s been working on a show being taken to competition since May, and they finally performed and are not advancing to the next level as of a few days ago.

I myself have been adjusting to a recent ADHD diagnosis and treatments, with the main concern being my weight. I lost 20 pounds in less than two weeks in February after getting sick and never put the weight back on. I now measure my height & weight every few weeks and plug them into an online BMI calculator to gauge if any changes are needed.

Today I was able to visit, and we had a great time. After I had left and arrived home, she texted me telling me that she discovered she was obese from a BMI calculator. This is a very big deal for her as she struggles with self image issues, especially about her weight and body fat.

She then asked me if I knew, and I told her the truth: Yes, I’ve known since around August, because I put her roughly estimated height and weight into the calculator out of curiosity just after I had checked mine. I did not tell her because I knew firsthand how hard she was working for the show, as well as how much it would affect her to learn that information, especially from me.

Revealing this, I profusely apologized. I made sure to specify that I was only offering to help because of her issues with herself, and that I have zero complaints or judgements to be made. Finally, I offered to help her find any diets or workout exercises/routines, and I also offered to be the one to keep her on track and stop her from quitting if she ever gets the desire to.

She responded saying that she did want to change, she is going to start a calorie deficit and exercising more, and that she wasn't upset with me but would not otherwise further the conversation. After coaxing her into it, she admitted that she was hesitant to involve me because she doesn’t want to disappoint me “when she gives up.” She also vocalized a concern of potential aggressiveness if I were to push her to keep going, which I said I would be more than okay with if it means she can be happier faster, to which she agreed to my involvement but asked me to specify how i would do so before she made her decision. 

The conversation is currently over as she fell asleep while I was explaining a compromise that allows me to offer my help only when needed/wanted. This compromise is in the comments.

62,1g6cprs,WIBTA if I announced my pregnancy at my Christmas/birthday party even though my sensitive ex would be there? ,"I (F30) and my fiancé (M31) recently found out that we’re expecting! We’re super excited, but as private people, no one outside of our immediate families will know this is actually my second pregnancy—my first ended in miscarriage. Out of a mix of anxiety and caution, we’ve decided to wait until after my anatomy scan (which is the week before Christmas) to announce it publicly.

Every year, I host a big gathering for Christmas and my birthday, since they’re a day apart. Friends fly in, and it’s the one time my divorced parents can stand being in the same room together. Since my scan is right before the party, and I should be starting to show, I’m thinking about using the “birthday” part of the evening to announce the pregnancy.

Here’s where the maybe asshole comes in—my ex (M32) will likely be there. We’re still “friends” because he’s close with a lot of my social circle, and we try to be civil. My fiancé and ex were friends for over a decade before things went south.

The TLDR of that was:

* My ex and I dated on and off for a year. It wasn’t great—he was controlling and obsessed with the idea that I’d “cuck” him if I did anything without him.

* Several months after our final breakup, my fiancé and I started dating.

* My ex demanded my fiancé choose between their friendship and me. My fiancé chose me.

* My ex then spread rumors that we cheated. We lost a lot of friends, and the ones who stayed neutral are why he’s still at gatherings—if they’re invited, excluding him feels awkward.

Even though my fiancé and I have been together for over a year now, my ex seems to have some lingering feelings or bitterness. He refuses to acknowledge our engagement and the energy is always off when I see him. Some friends think he’s still “grieving,” but my fiancé thinks we should cut him and those who defend him off. As for me, I’m just trying to maintain peace with the friends who stuck around after the pandemic.

None of our friends know we even want kids. I was the oldest sibling of many and used to joke that I’d “done my time” raising kids. I had an IUD and was actually scheduled for a tubal ligation, but I got pregnant against all odds. That first pregnancy and the subsequent miscarriage changed my heart about having kids. Since our friends don’t know about that, this announcement will come as a surprise—especially to my ex.

And yes, it’s half a Christmas party (so i can give my friends and family their gifts), but everyone’s really there for my birthday. 

So… WIBTA if I announced my pregnancy after the Christmas part of the evening, during my birthday portion?

ETA a few points:
1) I don't invite my ex. My attempts to ban him were met with hostility, and someone brings him anyway. 
2) Quitting the friend group will freeze me out of a hobby I've had since childhood. It's niche, requires a group, and Ex isnt even *in* the hobby.

63,1g6cn7p,AITA For not immediatly cleaning up after my toddler,"I come from a notoriously bad tourist country. We have one of the worst reps for tourists in the world and sadly it is probably deserved. I try my best to not live up to this reputation but I am wondering if I truly failed here.

We are at a family resort, and during the breakfast buffet my kid (11 months and change) enjoys eating on her own and doesnt like being spoon fed. So we give her a small plate and some of the food she drops from the high chair next to her (not throwing at other tabels or anything like that) At the end of the meal I obviously clean it all up and leave the table and surrounding clean.

This morning a lady came over and while she did not speak any english so i cant be 100% certain.  She appeared to berate me for not immediatly cleaning up every time my kid dropped something on the floor. The total of the mess was an olive, a chunk of bread and a slice of tomato if it makes a difference.

64,1g6cggv,AITA for making a meme where I portrayed my wife as a soy Wojak and now she’s furious?,"So, I need some honest feedback here. I made a meme about my wife the other day—just as a joke—and now she’s furious at me. I thought it was harmless, but apparently, she doesn’t see it that way.

Here’s what happened: My wife has this habit of asking me a ton of questions about everything—what I’m doing, who I’m texting, why I’m staying up late.

66,1g6c4a5,AITA for hanging out with my friend's ex-situationship and letting things get messy?,"VERY short version:
In high school, my friend Ana had a crush on a guy named Noah. They dated briefly, but things didn't work out. Despite this, I remained friends with both of them.

One night, while both (very) intoxicated at a club, Noah came onto me and kissed me. I was surprised and confused, but he apologized and laughed it off. I told Ana about the incident, and she was devastated, but said it was 100% on him, forgave me and we moved on.

Months later, Noah and I were hanging out with a group of friends. As we were about to leave, Noah approached me and gave me a hug. I hugged him back, and he picked me up off the ground briefly. This gesture was common in my culture, but Ana interpreted it as a sign that there was something romantic between us.

She became even more upset and accused me of leading Noah on, betraying her and trying to steal Noah from her. Our friendship eventually ended due to the fallout from this incident. Ana was extremely angry and hurtful, spreading rumors about me and trying to alienate me from our mutual friends.

I never had feelings or attraction for noah, to clarify!.

While I understand Ana's perspective now, I still believe I acted with good intentions. I valued my friendships with both Ana and Noah and tried to maintain them. However, in the end, I was unable to do so.
Am I the asshole?

When my husband and I were still dating he helped me build my credit, taught me about finances, and helped me gain a general knowledge around money and financial literacy as I grew up in a household that didn’t. When we got married we agreed to keep our bank accounts separate but bills come out of both on a 70/30 split as he makes more than I do. I wanted to do 50/50 or 60/40 but he insisted so that’s been what we do. All in all, it’s been working well and have had no issues. I don’t micromanage, neither does he. We run big purchases by eachother. Today he comes home from work and is laughing, I ask why and he jokingly begins to tell me the story. His coworker has never taken out a credit card, for whatever reason, but anyway today his coworker asked him if he could use his credit card to make a purchase but he ordered the wrong thing. I ask, what was it? How much was it? He turns his phone around to show me .. it’s an $1000 ENGAGEMENT RING! His coworker asked if he could purchase a RING on his credit and he didn’t even think to check in with me. I was upset and began to ask a number of questions. How much is this? How do you know he’s good for it? Why would he feel comfortable asking for something like that? We have rent coming up, I am clearly upset and I don’t think it’s unreasonable. He beings to say he should have never told me anything, stop talking to him like a kid who doesn’t know how to manage his money since he taught me, he says I shouldn’t worry about his money, it’s not my business what he agreed to with his credit, and if I hadn’t started berating him that he would have told me that this coworker apparently already zelled him the money for it. Now I’m even more confused. And honestly I think he’s lying so I would stop talking. Why would someone who has the full amount of money send it to someone else to order on their credit card? My husband responds “it’s an online thing you can’t pay without a card” I said OK but there’s no way in 2024 with so many places being cashless that he doesn’t have at least a debit card. If you’re saying he had all the money for it to send you right away why would he have you buy it? I’m assuming he’s lying and I’m livid he didn’t ask me first. Am I overreacting? This won’t make or break us but this is not chump change. I should also add he’s had this job for 6 months. This is someone he only met 6 months ago.

68,1g6bsgz,AITA for telling my roommate his girlfriend can’t stay over every weekend after she ate all my food—again?,"So, I own my apartment and rent out the second room to a buddy of mine. Everything was cool at first, but lately, his girlfriend has been staying over every weekend. I wouldn’t mind so much if it wasn’t for the fact that every time she’s here, she helps herself to my stuff—mainly my food.

I meal prep for the week, and I buy my own groceries. It’s not like I don’t share sometimes, but I’ve noticed that after every weekend she’s here, a bunch of my food is gone. Snacks, leftovers, even stuff like my eggs and bread—just gone. I’ve tried hinting at it, like casually mentioning how much food I go through, but it keeps happening.

Last weekend, I had a really long week at work, so I treated myself to some nice takeout and planned to save half of it for lunch the next day. The next morning, I open the fridge, and it’s gone. I texted my roommate, and he said, “Oh, my girlfriend was hungry, so she ate it. Sorry, man.”

That was the last straw. I told him we needed to talk and said that while I’m okay with her visiting sometimes, she can’t keep staying over every weekend and eating my food. I told him it’s not fair, especially since she’s not contributing to groceries or utilities. He got defensive, saying that since he pays rent, she should be able to stay over whenever, and I’m making a big deal out of “just a few snacks.”

I stood my ground and told him she needs to stop coming over so often unless they start buying their own food and being more considerate. Now, he’s pissed at me, and I’m getting the cold shoulder.

69,1g6bola,AITA for complaining about ding dong ditching,"So I’ve been having kids ddd my house for a few weeks now. 
It drives my dogs crazy,takes a while to calm down and it’s annoying. If it happened once or twice,sure whatever. But it’s repeatedly, sometimes multi a day.
Well tonight I finally caught them! Did it once, so I waited and here they come again after 5mins. Opened the door and yelled to get away from my house. 
One kid on a bike came back to my house on his bike and said he did nothing. I asked to speak to his parents and where his friends were (3 of them in total). He lead me to his friends. I want to talk to their moms cause they keep disturbing me in my house.
This is where I know IATA. Kid called me a fucking bitch and cunt. Grabbed their scooters, told them to bring their parents to my house to talk.
Back story, I recognized one of the kids. A few months back, this kid with his siblings wrapped string all around my husbands van. I caught them and told them not to do that. Husband cut it all off and threw the string away. They kept coming to sit in front of his work van, (which is in front of our house) so I stayed outside to water the plants and watch. They walked away and flipped me off. Whatever, annoying but at least they were gone. Well my dog alerted me someone was outside. I saw them and when I opened the door, they ran off. I checked his van and a note was taped to it that said ‘fuck you bitch’.
I figured out where they lived and took the note to their mom. She scolded them. Didn’t see or hear from them since, until tonight. Dad of one of the kids came over, apologized and said they’ve gotten complaints before about the DDD.
I did knock on the mom’s door of the kid who cussed but no answer. Asked the kid for his mom number. His sister kept telling him to apologize and he wouldn’t. So I said I’ll wait for his mom at my house. Kid threw a total fit and ran home. 
She came by. Grabbed the scooter and gave it to her. She started walking away and I asked her to talk. Went off on me.
She started saying stuff like ‘I work for the police force’ kids were playing and I bugged them.I told her they are banging on my door and doing ddd to other neighbors too, cause the other parent told me it’s both of them. Started yelling at me, asking why did she have to walk to my house when I had no problem coming to her before. I said ‘well they are your kids, you should be addressing what’s happening with them’ 
Obviously she heard me knock cause she started ranting how she was ‘on the fucking toilet and couldn’t answer the door.’
So here’s my question and where I might be the asshole. The mom has no control over those kids. And even though the two incidents happened months apart, I’m considering making a police report. Not cause I think anything will come of it today, obviously not. But from the way they acted, her response and seeing as this is the second encounter, I’m worried they will retaliate.

70,1g6bhce,WIBTA if I keep a 'stray' cat,"AITAH for keeping a 'stray' cat

As the title suggests, about a month ago I found a cat outside of my house! 

This was unusual as we do have cats that stop by from time to time (imo dumb neighbors letting their cats outside, shouldn't) but the cats alway seem healthy and we know where they live. 
  
This cat, however, we hadn't seen before. Kitty was extremely skinny and when offered food, woooofed it down. Super hungry, seemed very old and he was really really skinny and stinky.  No collar. 

Took to an emergency vet as our local shelter was closed and they had him picked up in the AM.  Checked for a chip. We made posts online about finding a cat and the shelter put it on a stray hold. 

We kept tabs on him as he seemed old and it made me sad to think this old man may not be adopted out.  

Turned out he was very, very sick and had we not brought him in, he would have died. Like, without a doubt, without medical intervention he would have died. 

So, old cat, not chipped, no collar, stinky, DYING, and thin. They also figured he was a stray or abandoned considering the condition it was in. He has hyperthyroidism. They said level 8. 

  Kitty was put on a stray hold, they got him on medication and after two weeks, was up for adoption. 

We adopted him and are already in love! He's got his old man meow and seems very happy. 

 Already gained one LB! It is a lot of work and the medication has a lot of side effects-  Hopefully he will recover fully, but he will be on an important medication, x2 a day for the rest of his life. 

Now, here is where i may be the AH. 

Today, I saw a post online from weeks ago, about a missing cat.

 This cat went missing the day before we found our 'stray'.  
The one picture that was posted was pretty blurry but this cat looks exactly like the cat we have with exactly the same physical features and personality.

 However, they got the sex of the cat wrong. 

Well, someone (the day after we turned the cat in) actually posted about the Stray we found. Linked it to the shelter page. 
 They mentioned how this cat was found right by the location that theirs was lost, matching the description and at the shelter. 

No reply. 

And then, another person ALSO mentioned that they think this was their cat. All of this was weeks ago.  Before we were even able to adopt him. 

They had plenty of time to locate their cat, and with it being so sick, I don't think they deserve him back.

 This cat was only missing for a day and was close to death. To me, that means they weren't taking care of it. No mention of any medical problems in the missing post. He was so obviously sick, bone thin, that I can't imagine they didn't have an idea that this cat was ill. 

AITAH if I don't contact them, letting them known I think we have their cat?

So today, I sent him a text and said, “Hey, the poop’s been sitting there for a few days now. Can you clean it up? It’s starting to smell and attract flies.” He responded with, “It’s just dog poop, relax. It’ll be gone soon.”

I told him, “It’s not just about ‘relaxing’. It’s your dog, and your responsibility.” Now he’s mad and said I’m being “overly dramatic” and “micro-managing his life.” He’s also saying I’m “making a big deal out of nothing” and I should just “chill.”

73,1g6an5m,AITA for planning to see a DJ I already saw last month at a festival I’m attending with my fiancée tomorrow?,"My fiancée had tickets to a festival in Miami and was going to go with one of his friends. A few months ago, he comes to me asking me if he can buy tickets to a different festival in California. I made a joke along the lines like seriously, how many festivals do you get to go to and if he was gonna buy the ticket I wanted to go to the festival in Miami as well. This was my only comment and it was said in a teasing manner with an audible chuckle. He immediately pulled up the site and bought me a ticket. I was really excited cause I had not ever been to this festival and was excited to share the experience with him even though it’s not my typical taste as far as music goes, but I can enjoy any good music. 

There is only one set that I really wanted to see and he knew this, it’s one of my favorite djs. Well two days before we leave for the festival, he decides to tell me that hey we might not see that set cause there’s an after party we (him and his friend) want to go see and we’ll have to leave the festival early. So it’s not like I can go off on my own and rejoin him later either. His reasons for why I shouldn’t be upset are that it’s a boys trip but as his fiancée, he bought me a ticket so in my mind he invited me to come and he should care about and respect my feelings enough to let me enjoy the one thing I asked for (but maybe I’m wrong). Instead of being made to feel like a thirdwheel that just has to do what they want the whole weekend… 

His response now is that I pressured him into coming along and having him buy me the ticket….when he did it on his own accord after I made one comment in a joking tone. 

I did go to a festival last month for the first time in over two years since I gave birth to our daughter. I went alone because it’s not his music preference either. He says because of this and the fact that I saw the dj I want to see in Miami at the festival last month, I don’t get to ask for it even if it’s the only thing I asked for. He’s also been to numerous festivals alone not just this year but since our daughter was born. He never stopped or took a break. He just kept going on his own… also the after party he wants to go to, is for a group he’s seen before numerous times and will see them perform at this festival as well… so, who’s the asshole?

74,1g6aknm,AITA for texting in a group chat that I hadn’t had time to eat?,"I was at my brother's college graduation with my parents. I had just graduated a week earlier, making it a proud moment for both of us. However, in our frantic effort to be on time, we skipped breakfast and lunch, leaving us desperate for dinner after the ceremony.

While waiting, I texted my college group chat about how nice the graduation was, mentioning I hadn’t eaten and was “looking forward to my first meal of the day. Hurray!” It felt normal to share, as we often discussed food and busy schedules when we were on campus together. However, one friend responded that my text could be triggering and asked me not to send similar messages in the future.

I instantly freaked out. If I weren’t at such an important event and so hungry, I might have handled it better. I started having a panic attack. For months, I had felt tension with this friend, perceiving their behavior as bullying. Despite my attempts to check in on our friendship, I never received clarity on what had changed between us, which made their comment feel even more personal and hurtful.

I stupidly responded immediately. I felt they were trying to embarrass me publicly, which fueled my anxiety. It seemed unfair to single me out for discussing missing a meal when others in the group had done the same. Their reaction felt disingenuous, especially during an important event.

In my response, I apologized for triggering them and assured them I wouldn’t send those kinds of texts again. I asked that if they had issues with me in the future, they reach out privately. They refused, insisting they needed to protect others from being affected by my comment. They claimed there were no hard feelings, but I didn’t believe them.

Still panicking, I texted them privately, expressing my preference for private communication in the future. They insisted they were right, claiming they needed to address it in the group chat to ensure others didn’t feel alone. The conversation escalated when I suggested they reach out to individuals if they were concerned. They accused me of immaturity for wanting private communication, asserting they were hurt and could handle the situation how they saw fit. They reiterated how damaging my message could have been and expressed hope that I would develop humility and accountability. I felt condescended to, misunderstood, and as if my feelings were invalidated. We ended our friendship there.

Afterward, I shared the texts with my therapist and confided in family and friends. My therapist felt my friend’s reaction was unwarranted, noting my comments weren’t inherently triggering. They emphasized that individuals should manage their triggers without expecting others to change. A mutual friend suggested both sides could improve but agreed my text was not offensive.

75,1g6ahpm,AITA for rehoming a dog that I agreed to foster for a short time when the owner has no plan for him? ,"My(33F) niece(31F) was in a bad DV situation and had to leave her and her ex’s small apartment with her 3 kids (10,9&3) and find a new place to stay bc she didn’t make enough $ to cover rent herself. She’s living with her mom now but she wasn’t able to take her huge doberman/german shepherd dog with her as a condition of living there. She also left her other small terrier type dog with the abusive ex. I agreed in August to foster big boy dog for a short time to give her time to figure something out, as I am pregnant and due in Dec. with my second child. We have our own dog that due to an abundance of caution to avoid any serious behavior issues or injuries, has been staying with my in laws during this time. 

We soon find out my husband is allergic to the dog and he won’t stop pooping in the house even when he is taken outside frequently. Last Wednesday I told her we needed to figure something out bc I can’t keep having my husband breaking out in hives, and the dog won’t stop shitting in the house. The next day she asks if I can “give her a little bit to try and figure it out” saying she’s trying to get in touch with someone through a friend who owns a boarding/rescue and knows other rescue owners too. I say that’s fine, it doesn’t have to be immediately. I don’t hear anything else from her until that Sunday when I offer that I have other family willing to take him, she said “okay. I’m still trying to figure it out.” I ask her to just let me know. Nothing is said until I bring it up again today, Thursday, a week after the initial conversation, asking if shes figured anything out and also mentioning that he is running low on food (which she had agreed to pay for while I have him.) All she said was “I’m still trying.” I told her I know she is (even though I doubt it) and that she has until this Sunday to figure out a plan bc it’s not fair to my husband that he’s breaking out in hives so much, besides the fact that I don’t need this much added stress this late in my pregnancy. She said “Yeah I understand.” and that’s it. 

I made a plan for my other family to take him Sunday afternoon (so in three days) if she doesn’t at the very least give me a plan by then. If the other family takes him, that’s it. He’s theirs. I told her this when she asked if “they would try to keep him. That’s the only thing that scares me 😅” She has not replied to me since I told her that TONIGHT (Oct 17th), except to once again tell me about how her baby daddy fucked up and failed his drug test his PO gave him! 

He is a very big dog and I don’t believe she is thinking about his best interests. He didn’t have vet care before this & has other issues besides the separation anxiety that need to be addressed, incl fleas and skin problems. I think she is being selfish bc shes afraid she won’t be able to get him back when she’s in a better living situation, which at the very least is going to be more than a few months from now. Her only options are 1: boarding him (expensive when trying to get back on her feet), and would be detrimental to his health bc of his separation anxiety, 2: find another foster willing to take on a huge dog, or 3: surrendering him to a rescue where she would have to give him up anyways. I feel like no matter what I’m going to be the bad guy, so I may as well leave the dog with my other family, that way I know he will be in a good home, will get vet care he deserves &the love he needs. I now realize I shouldn’t have taken the dog in the first place, but I care about her & really wanted to help her in this situation. I feel taken advantage of bc she obvs doesn’t have a plan at all.

76,1g6ags0,AITA for not doing the dishes at the right time? ,"I'm 19M and I live with my mum and my brother 21M. We usually take turns doing the dishes. Usually when it's my turn I chose to do them at the end of the day, as I'm usually gaming with mates and would rather do that stuff after. 

But for some reason they have a problem with that and want them done as soon as possible. Now I don't understand it because it's not like anyone's going to use dishes at 1am?

Anyway I want to help my mum but she doesn't let me. She always does it herself even when I've said multiple times I will do it, I've got it. It's funny because just yesterday and multiple days she's like oh you need to do more things around the house. Thus just made me so pissed off when the same old shit happened today because this was like the 10th time. 

The argument escalated and my brother got involved. I asked him why is it so important that it needs to be done at this time and he said, I don't trust you to do it when you say. (Just to note, I've started consistently doing the dishes for the last couple months and always do it when told by my mum)

But no my brother is basing me off actions like 2 years ago when I was less mature. What really stung is my mum said u do nothing around the house when I'm making the efforts to do things for her and even asking to let me do certain things. I expect it from my brother because he's never thought of me highly and he never will. But from my mum it fucking hurts bad. 

The real problem is just a complete lack of trust from both of them and it makes me feel bad because idk what I've done to deserve this. Or is it my fault? I don't get what doing the dishes at a certain time will change. It's not like it got in the way of either of them. I'm trying to be helpful but also do what I want at the same time and it's completely possible but it seems both people have a mental image of what I'm like. 

Anyway thank you for reading and please share your opinions. I'm really curious to see what people say

77,1g6aefx,AITAH? Thinking of not reaching out to tell cousin HBD who gives me silent treatments..,"Backstory: my cousin and I grew up practically as siblings. However, I did move states at 20, I’m 27 now. The move obviously changed our relationship as time went on. Even more so, I grew a lot once recommitted my life to Christ, going to therapy, breaking cycles, trying to become the best version of myself. 

I come from one of those small towns, poverty, drama, gossip filled, black neighborhoods. My family is extremely toxic.

I was diagnosed with CPTSD since therapy, also learning boundaries, standards, etc..& these changes has caused rift in majority of my relationships with family as they are the type to act like things never happened or sweep things under the rug, or disrespect is “not a big deal” because it’s “normal” where I from. 

Anyway, a couple years ago..this cousin got upset with me for not being able to make it to an event.

Because I didn’t make the event, this cousin gave me silent treatment. I addressed it & was called crazy & I felt bad & apologized for calling it out so I let it go. Since then, I did my best to make sure to show up, even if that meant taking out loans. with therapy, I was gaining strength to stand firm on my boundaries as I started growing resentment for not being able to say no out of fear of ruffling feathers or causing issues.

last year, he wanted to throw a Gala AND trip to Mexico for his bday. I pay my own bills, no help so I couldn’t swing both. So I reached out letting him know.. no response, silent treatment again for two weeks.

That hurt me, but ignored it when he reached out again like nothing happened. In March, he sent text about another bday trip (his bday in December), I told him I’ll let him know. In April, I sent him messages declining and again tried expressing how I felt about his silent treatments, etc. 

That went left to him cursing & stating “I think I’m perfect” I was so drained from his response of constantly not being able to validate my feelings yet, I’m always open & available when it’s the opposite. 

So I decided to let go & focus on me. I felt at peace. So much so I got a new car, new apartment, etc. In August he reached out saying “he apologized for whatever he did” crying saying he couldn’t sleep, was having anxiety attacks, etc.. and that “God told him that I’m the one that needs to apologize” 

I expressed to him that I don’t believe God will have me apologize for expressing my feelings and again pointed out the things he did, & expressed that I was at peace with just moving on because I felt like I tried, it was a long message, yet again of me over explaining. He just hearted it.. again for THIRD/FOURTH time, him not acknowledging or validating my feelings, not taking accountability. So I decided to not reach out ever again, moving forward. 

So my question is, his bday is coming & it’s alway a big deal, if you were in my shoes, would you reach out to say HBD or would continue to keep distance..

On Friday tho my sister (15) said she was going to hang out with friends after school. But on Friday when I was about to go she called me and said she was on her period and cancelled the plans and told me to pick her up. I was like I told him I’d pull up to his thing so I have to honor it. She told me she wanted to go home and it hurt. I said I can run and give you the keys so you can relax in the car but I’m not missing his match. She said that I should come to the car and I said I couldn’t.

She got mad and took the bus and has basically ignored me ever since. The kid did end up getting varsity because there’s only 1 other guy wrestling 106 that’s halfway decent. But since my sister got rlly mad at me and hasn’t been talking to me I’ve started to consider that maybe I should have just took her home.

79,1g69yhh,WIBTA for breaking a 3 year friendship?,"WIBTA is i stop being friends with someone after 3 yrs of friendship and confront them about being a slob. To start, me f19 and my roommate f21 and I started living together a little over 2 months ago. She lived here before me for a year with a different roommate. I'm currently trapped in a lease with her for a year. To make this easier we will call her Abby. 

1. Dirty Dishes, Mold, and Other Messes She leaves for Me to Clean.

So first, Abby has problems with doing her own dishes. She puts them in the sink with food CAKED on them. They will sit in there for at least a week before I cave in and do them. That is if she even bothers to put them in the sink. On some occasions she will leave them on the stove for days at a time. Secondly, she has a problem with keeping moldy food. Abby keeps food in the fridge for long periods of time until they are so moldy that you literally cannot even tell what it is. On top of that when I tell her I'm throwing it away she refuses to get rid of the container that the food was growing ecosystems in. And instead she throws it in the dishwasher. Then, she will leave trash on the floor, she leaves chunks of sauce on the stove, and I have scrubbed the table several times trying to get it clean but it's so nasty from her using it that it won't get clean and it stains every sponge I use black.

2. Skunk Smell and confrontation.

 I tried to say something about the moldy food because it was the most upsetting to me and she tried to manipulate me and lie to me by saying that that was normal. And I would understand her believing that if she grew up with a less tidy home but her mother and father are both fairly clean neat people. On top of ALL OF THIS she smokes w33d in the apartment which stinks so bad for at least 10 hours. And don't get me wrong I smoke and I know it sucks smoking outside especially when it's cold/chilly but she does it several times a day. 

3. Suprise! There's a guest here!

On top of THAT she invites people over and gives me no notice and then I'll come out of my room to go to the bathroom and random people will be here and it's uncomfortable and awkward. 

4. Backstabbing? Lies?

And on top of THAT she supposedly did the dirty with someone who did something awful to me (essayed) after I told her about it and continues to lie about it. She also brings up all the time that he won't stop hitting on her which is weird I think? On top of THAT she hid from me for months that her dealer was this girl who did something awful to me (essayed) and then bullied me when I tried to tell someone that it was really effecting me in middle school and when I asked her she was like oh yea I didn't say anything because I thought you would be mad. Then a month later jokes how that girl wants to be friends with her and says she's cool and offers for me to come with her to go buy w33d off of her. 

5. Why I think I'm an asshole.

However, we have been friends for 3 years and she was there for me at one of the lowest points in my life. She is extremely afraid of confrontation so I feel awful saying anything. She also may be going through a low point but I asked and she said no (but she may have been scared to tell me).I have also stopped talking to her recently avoiding her around the apartment trying my hardest to prevent losing it.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-18,"WIBTA for breaking a 3 year friendship?

80,1g69wvv,AITAH for  “ignoring” my friend who I just met? ,"Me (Female) and my best friend (female) were hanging out playing a game because we had nothing better to do. We both just met this new person who is now our friend while playing a week ago maybe 3 days ago not sure. All the sudden earlier we joined our new friend by accident but we didn’t mind but she came up too us in game saying hi and then accused me and my best friend of “ignoring her”. We don’t Ignore people without a GOOD reason. We just met her and she hasn’t done anything so I was very confused on what she was talking about. She said “I always say hi and you guys never say hi back when I’m OBVIOUSLY am in front of you.” Mind you in this game there’s 30 people in each sever and me and my best friend talk too each other not paying attention too the chat in the game at all. Everyone always talks in chat and my eyes have been hurting lately so I can’t see well she doesn’t know that so I told her quote on quote “I’m sorry my eyes hurt a lot and I don’t see you nor does my best friend”

She didn’t listen even though I told her and said “here’s reasons why I think you guys are ignoring me 1. You and your best friend hangout a lot I don’t  hangout with my best friend that much.”. All friendships are different and just because her friend doesn’t speak too her as much as me and my best friend speak too each other doesn’t mean we’re ignoring you. At this point I was very shocked about that reason cause it isn’t valid and I’m just shocked we have issues with her even though we just met her. She said “reason two everytime I join you join a round”… that’s how you play the game you make a team and start the game once you have 8 people you leave. She continued too say something extremely petty quote on quote “next time if you join me or I join you I’m not gonna say hi and leave just like you ignore me” I wasn’t ignoring her in the first place wich by now in this argument I said 6 different times. I was extremely disrespected and I was clearly disappointed. I talked too my best friend and another friend I have anxiety of losing friends and it reminded me of an experience I had when I lost a friend so I got anxiety. I seen her type “I feel bad now but i don’t know how too say sorry”. 

Later she texted the group chat saying “I’m sorry but you guys never talk too me not going too lie.” I simply replied saying “we have different texting apps from what you use and it isn’t our main app. we also don’t get notifications but you being petty was not how you should of handled it you should of asked us if we were instead of assuming and once again we would of said we were not ignoring you.” She replied with “you guys have tik tok you could have added me” I have bad memory and I don’t have the app I have the website. I said “I don’t have the app and I have reasons for everything I do. If you had a question you could ask us but we keep saying we aren’t and you keep saying we are even though we said so much.”

82,1g691q7,AITAH for asking my ex to take time off,"My ex (Richard 41) and I (Mom 34) have been separated for 2 years. He sees our 6-year-old(Max) every Saturday overnight into Sunday (usually at least 24 hours)  and every Tuesday for about an hour. This is due to his work schedule. 

He's a transportation driver for medical and developmental needs. He drives people from their homes to their jobs or day programs that are usually physically orlland or mentally delayed. He often works right at 5:30 a.m. and until 6:00 p.m. at night. But has a lot of downtime in the middle of the day. 

I am in the mental health field and I parenting classes. Currently I am teaching on Thursday nights classes from 5:00 to 7:00 p.m.Unfortunately I found out this Monday that next Thursday is Maxes kindergarten orientation from 530-630. 

I asked him to take the time off of work to bring our son because I am teaching my class. 

He refuses saying his work won't give him time off and his work is too important.... I almost never asked him to take time off of work to help because my work is mostly flexible. Unfortunately with the exception of this class it's a class of about 20 people and I'm the main facilitator If I have to take time off we either have to skip the week and make up for it or I have to hope and pray I can find a replacement and unfortunately the replacement is not going to know my parents and it's going to interrupt the flow of everything a little bit. 

I thankfully do have a great relationship with my first husband (Robert 33)  We were stupid teenagers when we got together and we separated because we just want the exact opposite in life(He's literally a super conservative and I'm extremely progressive, My favorite food is pizza and he hates it, I love going out into concerts and shows karaoke ECT. and he never wants to leave his house). I ended up quickly rushing into a relationship with Richard as we were friends before and we have a ton in common and on a friendship level get along really well, This led to Max. 

Robert also takes Max regularly on visits (about half the time he takes our kids we had together) 

I figured I would just ask him to bring 6-year-olds to the open house since Richard won't... But now Richard is saying he's not comfortable with it.

I'm also not super comfortable with it because I know that Robert will act like his dad and people will assume that he is 6-year-old's dad and that might be really confusing for 6-year-old.

I think he should just tell his boss He has to take that Thursday off and get out early the end. He needs to for his kid. He says you can't just tell where you have to take a time off You have to ask and if they say no it's no or you lose your job. We are in Massachusetts if that makes a difference.

Long story short it is not a good one. Lots and lots of unrealistic expectations, controlling behavior, and manipulation to obtain control. I’m finally moving out and have a plan to do so with my girlfriend of three years. We both just graduated from college (both 22) and are working in the same area. We’ve budgeted for years and searched for a place for months, and we finally have the end goal in sight. We toured a place that we love and think that we can be really happy there. We’ve already signed the lease and put down the security deposit.

I was initially given a hard deadline of the end of the month to move out by my parents. I had a place lined up and ready to sign for, but then had expenses added to my financial plate that I wasn’t aware of from my parents. Apparently the plan all along was for me to find out that I couldn’t move out in a month and have a “hard conversation” with my parents, which I think is ridiculous. If you tell me to be out in a month, I’m gonna do everything I can to be out in a month. My mom even lied to my face and told me she was excited for me and this first place that I was looking at when apparently the said plan was already in place. 

Fast forward to now, and my girl and I are signed on for this new place together. After the initial visit to this new place I told my parents about it and they ripped it to shreds, citing safety issues (based on anecdotal evidence from a long gone cop acquaintance), wanting us to spend more of our money to get something “better”, and reading too much into the “package safety box fee” that the apartment requires. I disagreed with these criticisms, and was called “disrespectful” for voicing my opinion, and for wanting to do something different from what they want.

My girl and I had done our research:
It is a safe area according to multiple sources. 
Why spend more money on something different when this is perfectly safe and has what we want? In this economy??
I personally dont give a damn about the package thing. 

The conversation in the above paragraph is the last I have spoken to them about it. My parents have given me little reason for me to want to involve them in this process…. Not just recently but throughout my relationship with them as described earlier.

Talking to my parents help a lot and reading the comments help me tons too so thank you.",0.0,-0.006169367581605911,0,1

I honestly never heard about this. I don’t know if it is cultural difference (I’m American and she is Mexican) but I find it very odd.

We have a spending cap of £800 PP for our gas and electric bills. Anything over that after our year tenancy is over we will be responsible for paying.   My housemates come from a different background compared to me. I’m from a working class and have to pay my rent myself as my student loan leaves me in a £1,600 deficit. My other housemates come from more privileged backgrounds (2 of them attended private school) and have their parents pay any rent not covered by loan. I was always brought up to turn plug sockets and light switches off when not in use and wasn’t allowed to usd the heating.   When we chose our rooms, Housemates A and B got the rooms they wanted as their first choice with B refusing to take any other room. These are the biggest rooms in the house which also come with the biggest windows. These rooms also tend to be the coldest. I have the smallest room in the house and my girlfriend was forced to take the “attic” room as everyone else refused to take it.   A and B claim that their rooms get so unbearably cold that they have to turn on the central heating. I do not want to use the heating and have even said i will turn my radiator off so i am not using it (the heating doesn’t work in my girlfriend’s room). 
The heating tends to be on more days than it isn’t and it is left on when no one is in the house and it is left on overnight.   Me and my girlfriend cannot afford to pay any extra charges as a result of going over our bills allowance so asked that in the case we go over the cap as a result of using the heating can our housemates cover the cost as won’t be using the heating at all.  My housemates have said that is ridiculous as i probably cost everyone the same amount from playing on my xbox around 15 hours a week. This is obviously not the case as heating costs roughly £2/hr whereas my xbox usage would cost roughly £1.11 per week. Lights and switches are constantly on even when no one is home and i am forced to turn everything off for them instead.  My housemates say that if A and B are cold then they are willing to cover the bill if need be (one of those is B’s boyfriend) and they are also in favour of keeping the heating on overnight so they can wake up to a warmer house. B does also have an electric heater. I understand that my other housemates are willing to pay if need be but me and my girlfriend are not and we can’t afford to. I’ve been told that if i can withstand the cold much better then i should be willing to switch rooms with B. I don’t agree as it was fairly obvious before moving in that their room would be the coldest.

I thiught I only had two hard and one preferred ""filters"" in my search. Nothing over 200k miles, an suv, and the preferred of third row. During my search, my fiance would say no to just about everything. And only approved of some very old vehicles, as in older than our oldest living at home. I want something newer than 2010, and found a beautiful 2014 7 seater that I got the seller to agree to $3.5k, $500 less than my full budget,due to it needing a new cosmeting bumper cover and a state inspection in order to get a rebuilt title. My fiance didn't want me even considering this car due to it being in an accident, but I met the seller yesterday and am going again tomorrow to fill out the paperwork and buy it from him. He bough it for $3k to flip and make a profit, but no longer has the space to work on it. So for less than $4k, I can get a car easily worth $8k. 

So am I the ass hole for not following my fiance wishes with this car?

Edit: To clarify, I'm buying this car tomorrow for $3.5k without her imput or approval knowing I'll need to replace the bumper and get it inspected. I'd be the one doing all the work and be the only one putting in any money. 

Also, I'm the guy, fiance is the woman. 

Edit 2: I had every intention of getting it inspected before buying it. And after telling the seller I would meet him at his place tomorrow with my friend who is a mobile mechanic, he got pissy.

90,1g65myt,AITA for being ungrateful that my partner bought me an orchid as an anniversary gift,"This is kind of a weird post as I know I am the asshole for not at least faking my enthusiasm over his surprise gift.

It was our anniversary (mind you, its been 9 years) and my husband came home with an orchid and a pot as a surprise gift. I honestly couldn't contain my slight disappointment at this gift. I don't have a great green thumb but I do have a personality that tends to fixate on a lot of things (to the unhealthy point that it consumes me) and I never give things up easily. Any green thumber would know that orchids are a tough flower to take care of. They need specific bright and indirect light, needs to water twice a week (which is so not happening given my schedule) and needs to potted in a specific bark and moss soil.

With the last orchid that was given to me as a gift last year, I complained openly about how stressful it has been for caring for a plant like this one and it eventually died on me. It was depressing. And my husband being the only person I would actively complain to would know that I for one did not want another orchid in my life.

But of all of the things he could purchase, he comes home with an orchid.

On top of that, the orchid is not even potted. It's in a airtight plastic cup with no soil. At least, he bought me a pot to go with it but expected me to figure out how to repot this sucker.

He left the price tag on both items so I know he paid some exorbitant price for this and we have been currently trying to save our finances. I get that he was trying to do something out of the blue and nice but knowing myself full well, keeping this plant alive is going to be the only thing on my damn mind for the next couple of months.

He obviously could tell that I wasn't thinking too fondly of the gift so he asked what the problem was. I sort of told him that while I appreciated the gift, I thought the gift wasn't well thought-through. He was visibly upset, reasonably so. I feel like such a bitch. And there goes our anniversary.

Our old one was spacious and the bedrooms were on opposite sides of the apartment so we couldn't really hear each other without yelling. Our new apartment is much smaller - the bedrooms and kitchen are all right next to each other. We can clearly hear each other from our respective bedrooms when talking at a normal volume. Both of our gfs hate this. This isn't a big problem for me since my gf lives alone and we normally hang out at hers. It is for my roommate's gf, Hannah (22F). She has three roommates at her own cramped apartment and spends a lot of time at ours.

I was eating a snack and watching some Netflix on my laptop in our kitchen a couple nights ago while Eric had Hannah over. While Eric was taking a shower, Hannah came out to chat. She started with pleasantries but quickly got to the point and asked that I spend more time in my room while she's over, and she'd appreciate it as a girl. I explained that I normally do but I like eating in my kitchen. She asked if I could eat at my desk, I told her it's more spacious and comfortable out here since our dining table is bigger. Hannah then said that she's uncomfortable with me being out here while she's over and she'd really appreciate it if I could respect her and Eric's privacy. 

The thing is, I give them plenty of privacy. I'm at my gf's a couple nights a week and I travel decently often. Eric has my location and can always text to confirm he has an empty apartment. I'm also not listening in on them like a weirdo. I'm usually wearing headphones and if I ever hear them having a private moment while I'm in the kitchen, I'll retreat to my room because that's super awkward. I responded to Hannah, ""Sure, no problem, one second"" and sent her a Venmo request for $2300. Told Hannah that if she pays my share of rent then I'll leave my apartment whenever she's here. 

She got really upset and as soon as Eric got out of his shower she was on his ass asking him to get his creepy roommate to stop bothering them.
