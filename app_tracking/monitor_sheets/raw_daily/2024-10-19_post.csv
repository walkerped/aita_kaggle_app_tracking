0,1g7gq2a,AITA for eating more than my half of the groceries?,"This is going to sound petty and I agree that it is but my girlfriend has been getting annoyed/angry about it. We live together and split rent and bills 50/50. When we go grocery shopping we will also split that 50/50. There are some things we get the my girlfriend doesn't eat/drink and vice versa. 

When it comes to things like snacks, we'll try to split them evenly. When things are individually wrapped that makes it easy but some chocolate and biscuits are not wrapped individually. 

I'll admit that I do end up eating more of these. Mainly because my girlfriend rarely has them. Whenever we run out of something It's always me who ends up replacing it. 

Last night my girlfriend went for a biscuit and there was only two left. She got annoyed and said she'd only had one of them and the packet was nearly empty. I told her I'd grab some when I'm next at a shop but she just said I shouldn't be eating more than half.

 I asked what the problem was since I am the one replacing them. She just said it's not fair on her since she is buying half of the groceries. I again repeated that she pays for half of the grocery shop but not half of the entire groceries as I'm the one regularly replacing things we run out of. 

She just said again I'm wrong for eating more than half and I should be more considerate of her. I asked what the problem was when the food is getting replaced but she just said I shouldn't be doing it.

Me (19f) and my roommate (19f) got into a debacle

Ok, so I’m sleeping, and hear noise. I go out to find that my roommate and unexpected Guest (who is kinda an acquaintance) are talking. I’m cool with the Guest so it's no biggie. Suddenly Guest asks Me “hey can I use your bowls (from the kitchen) to pack food at an event” that was happening later that day. The bowls were already sitting near Guest's bag (so moved from where they were - in the kitchen) I’m okay with helping, but also feels like I wasn’t, I wouldn't have a choice because the bowls were already moved without my permission. I agree and leave while my roommate goes back to talk to Guest so I text my roommate this while in the room: 

Me: Hey, idk if it was you who offered or took the bowls out, but can you not offer something to someone else if it's not yours to give.
I'm okay with it bc it's Guest, but doing that was like asking someone to borrow their pencil, and they already have the pencil in their hand. I wasn't cool with that.

Roommate: She grabbed it and I told her to wait until you come out to ask properly. I didn't offer it.

Me: Well, I would have appreciated it if you told her to keep the bowls there and wait till I woke up then to just have the bowls on standby....that doesn't really give me any options

Roommate: You definitely could've said no, you always have an option

Me: Well... no because it's Guest so l'm not too worried and she needed help with something.
Also, I'm just saying this to avoid similar circumstances in the future in case you are to invite someone and sometimes it's just better to avoid that situation altogether if possible then to be put in that situation and having to deal with unnecessary stuff. 

I was okay with overlooking the fact that my roommate didn't respect my boundaries and made a mistake because I never explicitly laid that rule before. I just want acknowledgment that their boundaries will henceforth be respected. my roommate brought Guest in the house so they are responsible for making sure they are respectful to the house environment. I wanted for roommate to tell Guest stop the moment they touched my bowls because it was not Guest's right to touch and not my roommates right to give. It's like asking someone if you can borrow their pencil after already holding it in your hand (that's my pet peeve). What made me mad was less of what occurred and more that instead of apologizing and saying they will respect that boundary they just said, oh you could've just no to Guest. What if I don’t  want to be put in that predicament in the first place, and by not placing my roommate accountable she will allow any guest they bring over to touch my stuff. They claimed that I could've easily said no to Guest, by why didn't she say no to Guest when they started touching my bowls?

4,1g7fss5,AITA for dresssing up as Sabrina carpenter?,"I (19f) have been told a lot recently that I look like Sabrina carpenter so naturally I dressed up as her when I went to a Halloween party last night. I dressed up as one of her tour outfits. I felt great in it and was excited to go to the party. 

When I showed my best friend (19f) the costume before we went out, she looked shocked and said, “You’re really wearing that?” I thought she was joking, but then she went on about how it was “too much” for a Halloween party and that I shouldn’t dress so revealingly, especially since we’d be around a lot of people. She said it made her uncomfortable and implied that I was just trying to get attention.

At the party, she took it a step further. While we were all hanging out, she turned to my boyfriend and said, “Wow, I can’t believe you let her wear that. Don’t you think it’s a bit much?” I was mortified. My boyfriend looked uncomfortable, and I felt embarrassed and self-conscious. I tried to enjoy the party but she just kept being passive aggressive.

5,1g7fek2,AITA for telling my brother he needs to get a job and go back to his apartment?,"My (30F) brother Chris (32M) has had a rough go lately. He got fired from his job 5 weeks ago and his girlfriend dumped him 2 weeks ago. For a little context, I currently live with my parents and have been since the beginning of the year. I had been living in a different part of the country and they offered for me to move back in with them to help me get back on my feet. Chris lives in the city which is about an hour away and we don’t get along. 

After his girlfriend broke up with him 2 weeks ago, he came out of the city to spend the weekend with us and to get out of the city. Except he never left. All he has done the past two weeks is sit in his room, smoke weed, and play video games. He keeps saying that he’s going to leave but then he never does. 

Chris is a grade a slob. He pees all over the toilet seat to the point it gets all over the floor, he never washes his facial hair down the sink when shaves, leaves dirty clothes all over the bathroom floor, dirty wash clothes all over the sink. He makes food and leaves everything out and all the dirty dishes are piled in the sink. There’s trails of clothes, shoes, and garbage all over the house. 

This lead to a boiling point earlier today when Chris freaked out at me for asking him to clean up after himself. Our parents are out of town for the weekend. Chris said he was going back into the city yesterday but decided to come back out and stay at my parents place while they weren’t here. I was tired of Chris’s mess and asked if he could clean up. He started getting shitty and insulted me by calling me a freeloading bitch for living at home with our parents. I retorted with hilarious of you to call me a freeloading bitch when mom and dad are paying your rent on your apartment while you’ve been hiding out at their place smoking pot and playing video games for two weeks straight. He called me a bitch again and I told him to go back to his apartment and get a job because the past two weeks have been insufferable due to having to clean up after a man child regularly.

6,1g7f3yp,AITA for bringing my own popcorn to the movies because my mom eats like a vacuum cleaner?,"

Throwaway for obvious reasons.

So, my mom (54F) and me (24F), have this tradition where we go to the movies once a month. It's fun and I love that I get to spend quality time with her, but there's this one major issue: my mom is a popcorn monster. The second the movie starts, she's inhaling the popcorn like she hasn't eaten in days. She's a pretty healthy lady, watches her diet and everything, she just LOVES popcorn. She finishes the entire bucket before the previews are done. And guess who gets none? Me. I tried telling her to leave some for me as well because i'd love a bite or two as well and she just shrugs and says ""You should eat faster"".

 Ths time, I decided to take the matters into my own hands and so I snuck in a separate bag of popcorn just for myself to enjoy.

 We got to the theater, she grabbed her bucket, we waited until the lights dimmed, and naturally, she started ravishing her popcorn. I started eating mine as well. Halfway through the movie, mom caught me munchin on my popcorn and I swear if looks could kill... She gave me this look, leaned over and whispered ""Did you seriously bring your own popcorn?"" and I just nodded and kept eating. 

 After the movie was done, she told me that what I did was very selfish, it would've been nice to share with her, and that I ruined her experience. I was a bit shocked, it's just popcorn after all, and she never leaves me some. Here's where I might be the A-hole: I told her she eats the popcorn like a vacuum cleaner and that she always eats her portion and mine as well, but she still expects me to leave her some if I bring my own. How is that fair?

 She doesn't want to go to the movies with me anymore. 

AITA for bringing my own popcorn because my mom can't control herself?

Edit and also update:  Thank you to everyone who took their time to comment on this silly situation. I'm back from a heart to heart convo with my mom, and I thought y'all wanted me to share. I'm writting this on my phone so I don't know how to update exactly. 

 So after mom called me ""selfish"" and said I'd ruined our movie night tradition by bringing my own popcorn, I knew something deeper must be going on. No one actually sane reacts like that for such a small thing.

 I sat her down and first of all, I just told her that I'm very sorry if I upset her in any way and that i'd like to know what's actually going on and why did she react like that over something so small. She tried to brush it off at first by telling me that I'm ""overthinking things"" and that I should just let it be, but one thing about me is that I'm really, really stubborn, so of course i did not, lol. 

 After some time, she opened up. It turns out she's been carrying a lot of heavy stuff for a while, and I had no idea. She admited she's struggling with feelings of loneliness and depression, and she tried to contact a therapist, but she's too scared to start. Since i moved out in 2022, she's had a hard time adjusting to an empty house (dad died in 2005), and she's felt isolated. Our movie nights were something she looked forward to, a small tradition that made her feel more connected to me and less alone.

 Also, she apparently has some health issues that she didn't want to share because she doesn't want to burden me with them (which is mindblowing to me) - she's been going through tests, waiting on results, and the meds are also messing with her, making her feel annoyed really easily, etc. All of this stress, combined with how much she misses having me around, made her lash out at something as small as popcorn bc, in that moment, it felt like I was pulling away from the last little bit of ""normal"" we had together. She panicked, got really angry out of nowhere and lashed out. She also said that popcorn is her comfort food, and she has it everytime she's alone because it makes her feel better and because she remembers our movie nights but still, she also said it might be stress eating something that she finds comfort in bc it soothes her.  She also apologized for the ""you should eat faster"" thingy, because that was just out of pocket and a bit mean.

 I've had my ups and downs with mom, but we settled on still going to the movies and while it's very freaking expensive, we'll buy two portions and she cannot touch mine (she actually can, of course). She knows she needs to control herself for her own good, and I'll try finding her a good therapist and if it helps, i'll even go with her. 

 Also, someone in the comments suggested I should buy her a popcorn machine for Christmas and I'm definetely doing that.

7,1g7ew98,AITA for refusing to let my brother's friend live with us? ,"

I just joined the campus my brother has been studying at and my Dad made me live with hime in the same bedsitter apartment to save costs on rent and also coz he's in his final year. This whole time he's been here, he's made friends obviously but for some reason they are always at OUR house because they have apparently normalized this and that's how they live.

 I didn't mind it at first but it started getting on my nerves a lot. My privacy was being invaded, I felt overwhelmed and never had time to myself because they are always around(I'm not even exaggerating there's no day that passes without them coming over). One of them, (Cyprian) hosted my brother the previous semester because Sam(my bro) did not have a house last semester. Now, Cyprian doesn't have one and his stuff is clumped up in our house including his mattress and he stays the night here for most nights despite us having told him to get a place since we lack space.

I just joined the campus my brother has been studying at and my Dad made me live with hime in the same bedsitter apartment to save costs on rent and also coz he's in his final year.

 I didn't mind it at first but it started getting on my nerves a lot. My privacy was being invaded, I felt overwhelmed and never had time to myself because they are always around(I'm not even exaggerating there's no day that passes without them coming over). One of them, (Cyprian) hosted my brother the previous semester because Sam(my bro) did not have a house last semester. Now, Cyprian doesn't have one and his stuff is clumped up in our house including his mattress and he stays the night here for most nights despite us having told him to get a place since we lack space.

8,1g7eq6q,AITA for not letting my sibling live rent free,"I posted about this a year ago before sibling 3 moved into the house. The situation hasn't been resolved so here I am
My parent passed away and left me and my two siblings a home with an existing mortgage in a trust. I was named the trustee. The trust specified we each have an equal share of the property (33%)

Sibling 3 has been living in the home for one year. Initially, they proposed to live in the home but we each pay our 33% share of the mortgage.
Neither of the other two siblings can afford to pay for another person's cost of living. 

To accommodate sibling 3, we ""agreed"" that their cost of living would equal to the cost of the mortgage.  The mortgage payment is incredibly below market value cost of living due to a refinancing of the house in 2020.
Sibling 3 feels they were left with no compromise and placed in an unfair position, that we have been abusing their labor on the property. And while I can conceed that they've done some maintenance of the property, the things that they've done to the property are things they've done for their own sense of ease (without consulting anyone )like tearing out frames around inside of the windows because they hated them. If I voice any concerns in their eyes I am a controlling landlord

When mentioned the trust ( us 3) is entitled to market value rent for the home and we each are entitled to equally benefit from the home. Sibling 3 mentions that we(I) want to profit from them. 

Heres the thing, I haven't changed/moved the home out of the trust. We cant afford to pay what the house will cost us, once transferred, the property taxes will be the current rate. Let alone figuring out how we'd assume the mortgage. 
Sibling 3's perspective is that they could afford to pay the property taxes if they had a roommate and didn't have to pay rent and they'd have extra room to build savings. 
I've consulted with lawyers who tell me the person living there needs to pay market-value rent we split those proceeds and from there pay our obligation of the mortgage. I've consulted a mitigator who would help us come to an agreement but it feels like I would be paying them to relay the same information I've provided to my siblings since day one. The trust doesn't have any money except the home.The other two siblings are barely scraping by. Im the only one with a savings so these costs would come out of my pocket. I'm at my wits end.

9,1g7du1i,AITA for trying to go on a walk outside?,"
I’m (23M) currently with my parents (49F, 52M) and my younger sister (22F) for the time being, personal reasons. Financial, etc. No need to elaborate 

My sister left for a hackathon a while ago and we are to pick her up today, I’m happy for her so I wanted to be there for her after the fact.

Because we all share one car, we need to coordinate driving and stuff. Our mother planned on picking her up alone but I decided to come along and drive there. I said I’d go on a walk and she can pick me up along the way at the turn we were supposed to leave by, but when I said this got upset and claimed I would be “Sweating” and “Stinky”

This the exact same excuse they would give me every single time they didn’t want me to be active, or be proactive. It’s currently breezy and ~60F where I’m at which is not hot at all, let alone enough to make anyone stink or sweat. They’d use this excuse to discourage me from exercising or taking strolls as far back as April when they saw me with a noticeable tan (Which I jokingly owned, being we are black and built for the sun) but they feigned genuine health concerns. Clearly.

I thought it was stupid she was still hanging on to that excuse during the *fall*, so I straight up asked, “I don’t get why you’re trying to discourage me from walking”

She got even more upset and claimed she *never* once did that, demanded I name a single incident where I did, and added that she’ll just leave and pick up our sister herself since I want to be so difficult.

My father decided to chime in, saying I can’t expect her to “Change her schedule” to accommodate me (Which I don’t *feel* I said or implied, I was planning on being back when she was ready to leave, or staying along the community exist so I can jump in the car, something we do all the time when I want to walk), said something like “You walk all the time, you can go one day without doing it if it’s gonna conflict with anything” and we’re all around being hella difficult until I agreed to cut my walk short (25 minutes) and be back by the time she claimed she would be ready to leave and shower before she left.

Another thing, when my mother says “I’ll be ready in five minutes” she really means 50 minutes. I’m back with 15 minutes to spare and she isn’t ready until 30 minutes after she demanded I be back by so I don’t “Stink up the car”

I told them when I came back, it’s cool, I showered, but I didn’t see it as necessary since I was supposedly leaving immediately after and would have to shower again (I personally don’t understand showering *before* you go out, I tend to do it after. But that’s a petty detail)

I’m driving there right now, typed this up while waiting for her to get ready.

11,1g7dorw,AITA for tapping someone on the shoulder at a concert?,"I feel like I’m crazy, or I could be missing something.

I was at a (loud) rock concert last night with a few friends. We were on the “floor” of the venue. We were in the crowd, roughly in the middle and all standing, but I had to leave to use the restroom. 

Upon coming back, I was trying to find my group again and moving past some people. If the person(s) could not hear me or didn’t notice me, I would gently tap them on the shoulder just to let them know that I was interested in passing them. When I say gently, I mean it. I’m not aggressive about it and I have a tendency to apologize whenever I do. A lot of “sorry/ “pardon me, thank you so much” as I pass.

I’m in the back and moving to the front. As I’m moving, one man turns toward me as asks me if I “touched his girlfriend”. I thought that I must have as I was passing her in the crowd, but the music was so loud that it was hard to hear one another. I will admit, we had to speak into each other’s ears at a close distance to hear each another. I said “I might have, but it was just a slight tap to tell her that I was near..”

He did not like that. Although it simply could have been the loud music that caused him to elevate his voice so that we could talk, he very curtly told me that “you need to ask for consent before touching other people!”. I know he’s right under any other circumstance, but we were in a VERY crowded venue floor with very little room to move through, and too loud to hear the person next to you. 

I said “I’m so sorry man” and he cut me off and told me not to apologize to him, and to “apologize to my girlfriend” and pointed at her.

I did. In my best nonverbal methods, I tried to show my apologies, and told her that I was “very very sorry for touching you and didn’t mean to make her uncomfortable”. Whether or not she could hear me, I don’t know, but I wasn’t going to risk getting too close.   She then just stared at me with a deadpan look, she said nothing, and I backed off. I was genuinely sorry if I made her feel uncomfortable in any way.

I was now met with a sea of people in front of me while I was trying to search for my group on the crowd. But now, I didn’t want to even bump into anyone with this guy right next to me with his phone out recording me. The guy told me to “get away from him”, but I told him that “I’m just looking for my friends” but now I didn’t want to touch anyone.

So there I was, just standing next to a guy awkwardly at a loud concert, eventually I was able to leave after a moment to find my friends.

What I’m asking is, is it wrong to gently tap someone’s shoulder on a crowded concert floor and apologizing while looking for my friends??   Am I missing something? Is gently tapping someone who can’t hear you taboo?

I (34F) have been friends with a former coworker (34F) for about 10 years. Our communication has varied over time—sometimes we’re close, other times distant. I got married the year we met, which created some distance. Later, I became pregnant, and she announced her engagement about five months after. When she got married, I couldn’t attend due to my divorce and lack of support for my child. I’ve apologized multiple times for missing her wedding, but she’s made passive comments about it over the years.

We reconnected in 2020, she visited me often, but she would complain that I never made the two-hour drive to visit her. I felt it was unwise to travel with a young child during COVID, especially since my car was totaled and her home wasn’t childproofed. She seemed to take my absence personally, often labeling me as “unreliable” despite my explanations.

Over time, my husband noticed her competitive nature toward me. He said she always mimicked my life decisions—marriage, kids, etc.—and that she seemed to measure herself against me. He was surprised I hadn’t noticed. I’ve only met her husband once, and he was rude, immediately starting a political argument.

She has confided that her husband is psychologically abusive, yet she still pushed for having children with him, which I never understood. When I asked her why she stayed, she would avoid giving a clear answer.

Now that I’ve moved out of state, we’re two days’ drive apart. My husband and I went through financial struggles, and I’ve faced serious health issues, which I’ve tried to discuss with her. But she dismisses my concerns, saying I “abandoned” her when I moved. She’s planning a party for her child’s birthday and insists I attend, despite my health issues and the distance.

Recently, she’s asked me for several professional favors, which would normally cost about $300. I did them, feeling guilty. She’s also made harsh comments about other moms, including wishing that her single mom sister-in-law wouldn’t get support from their in-laws, which I found strange and mean-spirited.

My husband eventually confronted me, saying she’s a covert narcissist and that I should move on. It made sense, so I stopped taking her calls. She then sent a letter, urging me to call her, but my husband pointed out that her tone seemed self-centered. I responded with an email saying I needed space and felt we’d grown apart, acknowledging the things she’s mentioned, and thanked her for our friendship.

14,1g7diwt,AITA for creating a safe account for my wife?,"

I (38M) and my wife Eve (33F) have been together for 4 years, married for 2. Eight months ago, our twins were born, and Eve decided to stay home with them (her decision, not mine). For some context, I grew up in a wealthy family, while Eve did not. Her mother, a single mom, was loving but had to work a lot, which influenced Eve’s decision to stay home with our children.

Now, I grew up with incredibly loving parents until I was 12. Everything changed when my dad was in a car accident that drastically altered him. He became angry, constantly yelled, and even started cheating on my mom. When I asked my mom why she didn’t leave him, she explained that she couldn’t afford to give us (three kids) the same lifestyle—gated community, private schools, etc. So, she stayed with him until he passed away a few years later.

Because of this, when my wife and I got married, I opened a separate account for her and one for our children. My intention was that, if for any reason I changed or became difficult to live with like my dad, Eve wouldn’t feel trapped or pressured to stay. Every month, I deposit a percentage of my income into these accounts. Both accounts are now approaching six figures, with the kids’ account having a bit more.

Here’s where things get complicated. A few weeks ago, we went on vacation and left my sister house-sitting. For some reason, she went through my office and found the paperwork for these accounts. I hadn’t told my wife about them yet because she’s proud and doesn’t like receiving big financial gifts, so I was trying to figure out how to bring it up without upsetting her.

Well, my sister told my mom, and they both confronted me. My mom was angry because I didn’t give her money for an upcoming surgery (she doesn’t actually need the money, as she inherited from my dad and we already help her financially). I explained that I created the accounts to prevent my wife from going through what my mom did, but both my mom and younger sister seemed to forget that part. The only person who’s on my side is my older sister.

Now, my wife is upset and says she doesn’t want the money, that I should give it all to our kids or my mom.

",Asshole,2024-10-19,"AITA for creating a safe account for my wife? 

I (38M) and my wife Eve (33F) have been together for 4 years, married for 2. Eight months ago, our twins were born, and Eve decided to stay home with them (her decision, not mine). For some context, I grew up in a wealthy family, while Eve did not. Her mother, a single mom, was loving but had to work a lot, which influenced Eve’s decision to stay home with our children.

Now, I grew up with incredibly loving parents until I was 12. Everything changed when my dad was in a car accident that drastically altered him. He became angry, constantly yelled, and even started cheating on my mom. When I asked my mom why she didn’t leave him, she explained that she couldn’t afford to give us (three kids) the same lifestyle—gated community, private schools, etc. So, she stayed with him until he passed away a few years later.

Because of this, when my wife and I got married, I opened a separate account for her and one for our children. My intention was that, if for any reason I changed or became difficult to live with like my dad, Eve wouldn’t feel trapped or pressured to stay. Every month, I deposit a percentage of my income into these accounts. Both accounts are now approaching six figures, with the kids’ account having a bit more.

15,1g7dg6o,AITA for not going to a Taylor Swift concert because its out of my budget?,"So the story is a bit long. My cousin (30M & single) and I (28F & married) have been Taylor Swift fans for many years, and we tried to buy tickets for the Eras Tour in Miami since October of last year. However, they sold out quickly. My budget was $600 for tickets, plus travel expenses since I live outside the US. In total, my budget was around $800, which was all I could afford given that I’m married and have other priorities.

We tried looking at resale tickets, but the prices were wild—starting at $1,000 minimum. My other cousin(25F & single), who lives in Miami, found tickets a week before the concert for $850, which was already over my budget, but I was still considering it. However, when I checked the plane tickets, they were $600 on the cheapest airline, bringing the total cost to $1,450. I talked to my husband, and he said it was too much to spend on a concert, especially since we have other priorities, like our house.

I called my cousin and told him he should go to the concert without me because I couldn’t afford it. He started suggesting I ""put it on my credit card and pay in small installments"" or ""just go and deal with it later."" I explained that I had other priorities and couldn’t spend that much on just a concert. He has a lot of airline miles, so his flight would only cost $50.

Since then, my cousins have been sending me messages, saying I should go because it’s a ""once-in-a-lifetime experience."" I really want to go, as I’ve been dreaming about this concert, but I also know I have responsibilities, and I can’t justify blindly spending $1,450. They keep messaging me, making me feel bad about not going. Today is Saturday morning, and the concert is tomorrow. They’re saying I still have a chance to buy my tickets.

16,1g7c4y5,AITA for refusing to adjust my periodically unhealthy eating habits?,"I (F 25) have been dating my bf Michael (M 25) for 5 years. I’ve always had irregular eating habits- one month I’d be in the mood to “enjoy food” more and the next I’d get the inspiration to “eat less”. Michael, on the other hand, has always more or less been consistent and we sometimes eat the same amount of food despite me being 117lb and him being 140lb.

Last week we ran a 5-mile on the treadmill. It was our first time doing so in a while and we were famished afterwards. We went out to Five Guys, where I ordered a cheeseburger with toppings, fries, and a shake. He ordered just the burger, but in the past we generally share fries and the shake at other fast food joints even though he’s expressed his dislike with eating fries. He tried to dissuade me from getting the shake, saying “I could get it later after I finished my meal” but I wanted a nice cold drink with my food so I got it. 

While we were eating, I kept hearing comments from him like “that was so many calories” and “Five Guys portions give much more calories than other fast food places”but I was starving and didn’t pay much heed, finished the burger, then ate half the fries. He ended up eating some of the fries and drinking the shake. At this point I was a little overstuffed.

Later, we went home, and I expressed that I just wanted filling food, and wished to let loose without hearing the health concerns. He proceeded to lecture me on how what we had was too much food - we had one day’s worth of calories in a single meal, that I didn’t really keep track of my calorie intake and I should at least have an idea, and that we had the option to make a healthy choice at Five Guys but didn’t. I responded that we rarely ate at fast food places to begin with (think 1 time every one or two months) and that it was fine to let loose in a while. He said we should always be aware of our calorie intake. We got into an argument where I accused him of trying to control my diet and he said I was not trying to take a healthy suggestion into consideration. I tried to make suggestions like “I can get a burger, shake, and fries and take home leftovers, and you can just have the burger” but he was insistent that we should stop consuming that many calories at once.

Later we talked to a couple’s therapist and she said I was being invalidating by not acknowledging Michael’s concern that it was just too much food. I don’t know now if I was too rigid on my eating stance and refusing to make a healthy dietary suggestion for no good reason.

They went and everyone else went into a shop to look around whilst they were waiting. My 2 year old was with my sister and I saw them leave the shop everyone else was in, so I asked where are you going? My sister said another shop. I decide to wait in place for my stepdaughter to return from the toilets. We then can’t find my sister. After searching all of the shops for them we eventually find her and she’s bought my daughter a new pair of Nike trainers. 

A few weeks ago, my sister turned up to the house with a brand new scooter for my daughter. She has a habit of buying her something new every time she sees her. At that time, I bit my tongue, but called her after and said I would like her to stop. My daughter has lots of toys and does not go without, she’s only two and will become entitled and spoiled if you keep doing this. In addition Christmas is around the corner and her birthday is shortly after, I don’t want her receiving anymore gifts before then because it will make Christmas and birthday extra special. At the moment my partner isn’t working and money is a little tight, I also took my daughter out this morning and treated her to some glow in the dark pyjamas- which I said to my sister I should really have saved for Christmas but they were cheap and she deserves a little treat. My sister also turned up with a magazine for her.

So anyway, I told my sister that I thought we spoke about this and I didn’t want her buying things anymore. She immediately put me on a guilt trip saying she wants to and her and my daughter were excited to show me. I said I love them and made a fuss to not upset my daughter. My sister then said she doesn’t get why I’m annoyed, I wasn’t going to buy those exact trainers for Christmas and she doesn’t care if my daughter expects presents she will keep buying them. She kept asking me why she can’t just buy her things. I said to her you don’t understand that you’ve crossed a boundary and should be apologising not justifying and asking for an explanation. I’m her mother and she answers to me not the other way around. Anyway my sister got really upset with me and left immediately. AITAH?

But my sister isn't known for behaving good and the friends who were getting married didn't want her there as a result. So my parents were in a bad mood and my sister was upset.

My parents coddle my sister a lot. She acts really babyish because she's treated like one by them. They make me act like it too. I'm supposed to be ""soft and caring"" with her. They'll make me do stuff with her because she wants to and it doesn't matter what I'm doing. They interrupted me during homework to go to drive with her and mom to her extra curricular activities because my sister wanted me in the car. They make me give her hugs if she wants them even if I don't. I have to hold her hand if she wants to hold mine. They took the lock off my door at home so I'd need to let her sleep in my room if she wanted to. Stuff like that is normal for us. And saying no doesn't do anything. My grandparents have said they go too far as well. But my parents brush it off.

My sister doesn't like sleeping anywhere but our house. So she hated the idea of going to our grandparents. And yeah, we'd have stayed at a hotel if we joined our parents for the wedding so don't ask me how that would have worked. But after our parents dropped us off my sister was being super clingy with me and she wanted us to do stuff together the entire day and be home with her to put her to bed. My grandparents knew my friends wanted to meet up so they gave me money and sent me out for the day (and until late that night). My sister begged me not to go. She cried and threw a fit and continued after I left. When I got home she still wasn't asleep but my grandparents made sure I could stay in ""my room"" alone and let me lock it.

My parents were so pissed when they picked us up and my sister was still upset and my grandparents told them (our parents) they should be ashamed for letting it get that bad. My parents told me I should be ashamed for leaving my sister in distress like that and where was my love for my baby sister, with a strong emphasis on the baby part.

This is a pretty stupid situation but recently my (18F) friend (19F) went on a date with a guy she really liked, I'm the only one in my friend group that wears makeup and I'm pretty good at doing it on myself but I am by no means a makeup artist and not great at putting it on other people.

My friend was pretty upset about it because there's nobody else that she could go to for makeup, I offered to practice putting makeup on her a few times before her date so if it didn't turn out well it wouldn't ruin her date but she insisted that that was unnecessary and that it would be fine if we just did it on the day.

I didn't feel comfortable doing that and refused again so she said I was ""gatekeeping"" my makeup skills and complained to all our friends about it. They're all on her side but again none of them wear makeup so I don't think they understand how hard it is to do it on other people Vs yourself.

Me (17F)and Z(16M) have known eachother for about 3 years and we’ve been basically unseperable ever since we met.

I asked him if something was going on, and he said that he didn’t know anything. The day I came back to school a friend (not from the friend group) told me that Z and one of my other friends(M - 17F), have been talking shit about me behind my back. After school I texted Z that quote I was hurt that he knew what was going on and didn’t say anything (we have a super open friendship and we agreed on telling each other everything even if it hurts the other person). He responded to me saying he was sick of people using him to get information (I have never done that before) and he was not getting in between my and M’s argument. I did not know that me and M were arguing, nor did I know what caused her to be mad, because I have not seen both of them in two weeks. Not even five minutes later I see that M has texted me why she was mad, and turns out it’s because I said a comment about her always getting mad at the whole friend group, and about me talking about her behind her back - which I did one time this year to Z himself as he was the only person I actually trust in the whole group. What I said was that she was acting weird and distant because she was mad at all of us, and wouldn’t talk to anyone for the whole day. Anyway so while I was saying sorry to M suddenly Z started texting me as well getting mad at me, and saying things such as “you think you’re the queen of the world, and that i’ll just tell you everything” or that I’m a “changed person”. I don’t know what happened and genuinely was so confused.

We've had our cat for years, since my brother and I were both kids, and all took part in taking care of him. As time moved on however, I began picking up nearly all the responsibilitity of taking care of the cat and often times would be the only one to even play with him. I was moved out for some time and was unable to take the cat, but when I moved back in less than a year later I found the situation bad. 

I had fought for years to curtail my cats habit of running outside, explaining to my family all of the various reasons he can't have free reign and that if he is outside he needs supervised. Now, he begs to be let outside constantly and my family always gives in. He begs for food incessantly and has become overweight. He terrorizes the neighbor dogs and kills small animals. Neither M or B will do anything about it after many a confrontation. I'd be willing to let even all that go if not for the fact that every single morning he mews at my window to be let in. Why me? Because nobody else will bother letting him in even if they are awake. So every single morning I get up generally after about two hours of sleep after my shift to let my cat inside the house only to be asked why I'm up so late and told to keep the noise down. 

I can't be fucked anymore to be honest, I'm thinking it would be better for all of us if the cat just disappeared to a friend's house until I can get in my own place and retrain him myself.

Without arguing with my MIL, I told my wife that because you feel left out of the conversation that is reason enough for me to speak English as much as I can, but the first language still comes out from time to time, because again for 30 years that’s how I spoke to my parents.

29,1g796nm,AITA for refusing to hold an “intervention” for my friend? ,"This is a fairly long story so I am going to summarize some parts. 

So I (25F) was asked by a childhood friend (29NB), let’s call them Sam, to hold an intervention for their former partner who is also a childhood friend of mine (26F). We’ll call her Jean. 

Sam and Jean have a child together, a 2.5 year old. A few months ago, they had gotten into an argument where Jean ended up asking Sam to leave her house and because she felt unsafe, she ended up calling the police. Sam eventually left on their own accord and Jean asked them to not come back, stating that she’d prefer them work through the courts for shared custody of their daughter, as she no longer wished to speak to them. Since then, Sam has come to me and my fiancée, also (25F) to confide in and get advice from. They missed their child and wanted to do anything they could to see her again. They felt betrayed that someone they cared for would pull their child away from them call the police on them. We vaguely understood as new parents ourselves, our daughter being only a month old at the time. 

But slowly the simple venting and sharing of advice turned into increasingly ridiculous pleas for help. They first asked us to sit down and try to convince Jean that she overreacted and to let Sam see their child. We agreed to sit down and speak with her to see what was going on from her end, but made no promises. Jean stated that she felt unsafe around Sam and just wishes to figure things out legally. Sam simply did not want to agree with this, believing that if they settled in court, this meant their parents would get grandparental rights. 

Sam has not had contact with their parents for a long while as Sam had a traumatic upbringing on behalf of them. Jean, on the other hand, has been allowing their child to visit her grandparents regularly. One day, Sam came up with a plan. They wanted me to watch the children while my fiancée and another mutual friend of ours held an “intervention” style meeting for Jean where we wouldn’t allow her to leave until we convince her that she was wrong to take Sam’s child away from them and that she needed to work out a custody agreement out of court and stop allowing their child to visit their parents. We refused, as it seemed like an irrational idea. Jean comes with a lot of baggage herself and I was certain that cornering her would do no good.

But when it became too much and too uncomfortable for me as a new mom, I distanced myself and eventually we cut ties. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-19,"AITA for refusing to hold an “intervention” for my friend?  This is a fairly long story so I am going to summarize some parts. 

So I (25F) was asked by a childhood friend (29NB), let’s call them Sam, to hold an intervention for their former partner who is also a childhood friend of mine (26F). We’ll call her Jean. 

Sam and Jean have a child together, a 2.5 year old. A few months ago, they had gotten into an argument where Jean ended up asking Sam to leave her house and because she felt unsafe, she ended up calling the police. Sam eventually left on their own accord and Jean asked them to not come back, stating that she’d prefer them work through the courts for shared custody of their daughter, as she no longer wished to speak to them. Since then, Sam has come to me and my fiancée, also (25F) to confide in and get advice from. They missed their child and wanted to do anything they could to see her again. They felt betrayed that someone they cared for would pull their child away from them call the police on them. We vaguely understood as new parents ourselves, our daughter being only a month old at the time. 

But slowly the simple venting and sharing of advice turned into increasingly ridiculous pleas for help. They first asked us to sit down and try to convince Jean that she overreacted and to let Sam see their child. We agreed to sit down and speak with her to see what was going on from her end, but made no promises. Jean stated that she felt unsafe around Sam and just wishes to figure things out legally. Sam simply did not want to agree with this, believing that if they settled in court, this meant their parents would get grandparental rights. 

Sam has not had contact with their parents for a long while as Sam had a traumatic upbringing on behalf of them. Jean, on the other hand, has been allowing their child to visit her grandparents regularly. One day, Sam came up with a plan. They wanted me to watch the children while my fiancée and another mutual friend of ours held an “intervention” style meeting for Jean where we wouldn’t allow her to leave until we convince her that she was wrong to take Sam’s child away from them and that she needed to work out a custody agreement out of court and stop allowing their child to visit their parents. We refused, as it seemed like an irrational idea. Jean comes with a lot of baggage herself and I was certain that cornering her would do no good. She is still my friend and I don’t believe her feelings in the situation are exactly wrong either. We encouraged Sam to instead work on legal action to get custody of their daughter and offered any other help we could give.

30,1g78th8,WIBTA if I escalate the situation with our Photographer?,"I got married 3 months ago and we hired a friend/acquaintance to do our wedding photos. He wanted to get into photography and first did our engagement photos for free for practice. (He offered this on his own but we still gave him a $70 dollar gift as thanks).

They to turned out nice so we asked him to do our wedding but insisted on paying. However, I knew we didn't have a bunch of money so I told him at least 3+ times he only had to do the ceremony(1hour or 2 hours max) and they can leave because I didn't want to have him work all day and feel bad for not giving more. The most we could give was $250 which would have been 100+/hour for their time.(We had a super low budget wedding, we don't have a lot of my money)

But he insisted on taking some cake pics and after wedding pics with family. I eventually gave in because he genuinely seemed to just want to do the most he could do. He also helped out with small things which we appreciated and I later offered to take him to dinner as thanks. 

Last month he told us he lost the wedding photos but did give us what he had which sadly was nothing from the actual cemaromy. It was only a few pics. One of the cake, 4 photos with family after the wedding, and 2 photos from me and my husband outside the church after the wedding.

Got nothing from the actual ceremony which is all I wanted originally. He offered to refund the amount we gave him + to take some makeup photos at a location. I accepted the offer but then confusingly they later replied saying that they actually think they deserve to keep half because they were there the whole day and did other things. And that if they give back half they won't do any makeup photos. But then why did they offer if they didn't mean it??? Really confused me. The part about not doing makeup photos if they gave half back also rubbed me the wrong way. 

I honestly was taken aback by this. I didn't ask them to stay the whole day or help. They insisted many times to do more than the 1-2 hours of their time I originally asked for. I appreciate everything they did, but I'm just left frustrated with nothing I originally asked for. I declined make up photos and told them I was frustrated with how it was being handled, and to just refund what they want because I don't want to fight. 

A month has passed and I haven't gotten any refund at all, not even half. At this point I just can't understand how a person can lose someone's wedding photos and not feel guilty enough to not send anything. So I'm wondering if I should text them again asking about it, just let it go, or be petty & take them to court for being in my opinion rude about this whole thing.

I want to add in case anyone accuses me if being a bridezilla, I didn't even want the stress of a wedding, my husband did. So I was super chill about everything.

31,1g785gd,AITA asking to swap a 'chore' day?,"My wife (29F) and I (31M) have a toddler (3M) who goes to nursery five days a week. Neither of us really likes doing the nursery run, because to make the drop-off and get to work means you need to wake up incredibly early to get showered and dressed before setting off, then still arrive at work a bit late / flustered / covered in baby food

So we didn't argue about it in the morning, we agreed a system of wife does Monday+Tuesday, I do Wednesday+Thursday and then we flip a coin on Thursday evening for who does Friday. Obviously this isn't a totally hard and fast rule; if one of us is ill or away for business then the other takes over, but in general we usually stick to it

This week, wife has some friends in town from overseas, and they're leaving on Monday morning. She is going to go out with them on Sunday evening and asked if I could do the nursery run on Monday morning so she could stay out a bit later / have a few drinks and still be functional in the morning (because she'd have more of a lie in). I said no problem, and asked her which of my Wednesday / Thursday day she'd prefer to take as a swap.

She absolutely blew up at me, accusing me of treating the relationship ""transactionally"" and accusing me of ""keeping score"". She hasn't spoken to me since beyond strictly necessary conversations about childcare. I know this sounds like there's a piece of the conversation missing, but it was genuinely like I'd said, "" Sure, if I can get a hall pass to cheat on you"" or something that extreme, and her reaction was instant and very strong.

From what I can gather from her (it was quite an emotional conversation) we ought to just do each other's days if asked (without swapping them for another day), because it will probably come out in the wash, and anything other than this - especially tracking to make sure the workload is approximately equal - is unacceptable to her. I'd note I had absolutely no idea she thought like this - for example I earn more than her every month, but the amount I make is variable because I'm on base+commission, so I track quite extensively to make sure our disposable income is the same each month and she is quite attentive to this conversation, but has never said it makes her uncomfortable

It isn't like her friends are blowing up my phone or anything, but I genuinely can't fathom how my wife thinks she's in the right here, let alone how she's so confident she's right that she's giving me the silent treatment.

32,1g77k5g,AITA for making my kid cousin cry because I wouldn’t let her hug me,"I (18F) live with my aunt because the rest of my family is abroad, and I stayed behind to finish school. Living with her was my only option. My aunt has two kids, 7F and 3M. I grew up in a pretty big household with five other siblings, so I’m used to noise and chaos. But as the oldest, I still got some alone time. Before we moved, we lived in a small 3-bedroom apartment with 7 people, so I’m no stranger to cramped spaces either.

Now, my aunt’s kids are… a lot. They’re loud and, frankly, spoiled. The older one, my 7-year-old cousin, is especially clingy and hyper. Every time I come home from school or work, she sprints at me like I’m a human jungle gym and starts hugging me. But not in a cute, ‘aww’ way—more like a WWE move where she squeezes too hard and likes to bash her head into my hips or stomach. It’s exhausting, especially when I’m already tired.

I have ADHD, so I can get easily overwhelmed by too much noise, touch, or just feeling overstimulated in general. When I come home, I need some personal space to unwind, and I’ve explained this to my aunt. But my cousin doesn’t seem to get it, and the constant hugging is starting to push me past my limit.

Recently, I told my aunt about how I sometimes sit on the stairs after work just to mentally prepare myself before having to deal with my cousin’s… affection.

33,1g77gqi,AITAH for telling my sister she has 90 days to find a new place to live?,"When I (39F) was in the military, I asked my second oldest sister (40F) if she could stay at my house while I was deployed to help my husband take care of my 3 year old and my newborn. She was still living at home with my mom and step-dad at the time. She had a part-time job, and I was going to be deployed to Iraq for about a year. She said yes. 

My mom passed away the following year after I got back from deployment. My husband and I let her stay with us, and she continued to look after my children. As my children got older, the  need for her to stay at home lessened, and we talked about her getting a job. Whenever we have moved, we have rented or purchased a house so that  she would have a room to herself. My kids didn't get separate bedrooms until 2019. Throughout the years, we have basically provided for her as one of our children. We helped her get a job, her license, gave her a car, and put her on our insurance. We drove her to and from work when she didn't have her license or a car. I was silently waiting for the ""I want to go out on my own"" conversation from her that never came. 

We have butt heads a lot, and for the past 2 years, it's gotten intense. We had a blow-up earlier this year, and she pretty much told me that she has nothing because of me. Basically that she put her life on hold for me. She has told me I'm controlling and two-faced and always want things my way (I can't tolerate a dirty house), and when it's not done my way, I throw a fit. She has also said I'm not a mother, and I don't listen to my children. She has said that my husband is not a father because instead of spending quality time with them when they were children, he was working or playing video games. Needless to say, my youngest feels closer to her aunt than to us and cobsiders her more of a parental figure. However, we have always had clothes on our backs, a roof over our head, and food on the table. 

The thing is, she seemed/seems really unhappy, ""living under my rules."" Honestly, if I could buy her her own house, I would. We were raised by our mom with the concept of family first and always. However, as I have gotten older, I don't blindly believe in that anymore. I have had conversations with my kids (16F and 19F) that if they truly feel like I or their dad is a detriment to their overall well-being and if we truly threaten their peace it's okay to cut ties and walk away. 

I want my sister to feel like she has something of her own. I don't want her to keep using me or my family as an excuse as to why she can't do what she wants when she wants to. I told her she'd always have a home with me. However, she needs to leave the nest.

Later that day he messages me and sends me some blurry photos saying there is no albino one. I couldn’t really tell from the photos but it did appear the fish were all dark in colour. Messaged the seller and said I had not received an albino one with which I laid £12 for (other fish were only £3) he replies and just says “you ordered 3 fish they are correct”

I messaged back and said my friend is saying there is no albino and when I took a look they all looked very dark. Got no reply. Couple hours later friend sends me clearly pics and there is an albino one. I messaged the seller and said it was my mistake and I’m sorry but there clearly is an albino one. I’m always very polite when messaging sellers and didn’t really want to message for my friend in the first place but he was pushy about it and adamant there wasn’t an albino fish there. 

Anyway not friends with the guy anymore and went to order some fish my my self from this seller just now many months later and it appears I’m blocked from buying from him and he isn’t answering my messages.

So AITA for complaining then apologising that it was my mistake?

Messaged the seller and said I had not received an albino one with which I laid £12 for (other fish were only £3) he replies and just says “you ordered 3 fish they are correct”

I messaged back and said my friend is saying there is no albino and when I took a look they all looked very dark. Got no reply. Couple hours later friend sends me clearly pics and there is an albino one. I messaged the seller and said it was my mistake and I’m sorry but there clearly is an albino one. I’m always very polite when messaging sellers and didn’t really want to message for my friend in the first place but he was pushy about it and adamant there wasn’t an albino fish there. 

Anyway not friends with the guy anymore and went to order some fish my my self from this seller just now many months later and it appears I’m blocked from buying from him and he isn’t answering my messages.

So AITA for complaining then apologising that it was my mistake?

Edit: 

The fish did also get held up a day which they weren’t meant to (24 hour postage so they arrive alive) and two didn’t survive past a day. I was in contact to him about the delay before this and he wanted to know if they arrived ok.",4.0,0.09954521,0,0
36,1g778v7,AITA for asking my neighbor not to park in front of my house?,"I (29F) have lived in my suburban neighborhood for three years. Lately, my neighbor Jake (mid-30s M) has been parking his car in front of my house almost every day, even though he has a driveway and space in front of his own place.

At first, I didn’t mind, but it’s become frustrating when I have friends or family over, and they can’t park nearby because Jake’s car is always there. I asked him politely if he could park in front of his own house, especially when I’m expecting guests.

Jake got defensive, saying, “It’s a public street, I can park wherever.” While I know he’s technically right, it still feels inconsiderate. Now, he’s cold towards me, and the situation hasn’t changed.

Some friends think I’m being petty, while others say I had every right to ask.

Me, my homie, his ex, and his ex best friend all were in a little friend group. We even traveled across the country from the west coast to the south together. 
I became friends with his ex’s best friend , i’ll just call her B for this post.

Me and B became genuine friends.

My homie and his ex got in a really REALLY bad breakup, so i cut what little i contact i had with his ex, and stopped talking to B for a few months.

B texted me one day and asked if i wanted to hang out and i told her i wouldnt since i knew my homies ex would be with her.

A few more months go by and she texts me again. We call and arrange plans to hangout at her new apt. I get there and its her and my homies ex. I already expressed the fact i didnt want to hangout if she was gonna be there, but i was already there and didnt really care atp if im being honest.

All 3 of us hangout, just kicking it. Took a few pics. Thats it. And then i linked up w them one more time to watch their cat.

Well the picture got out to my homie, and we fell out hella bad. He says im wrong for not letting him know and the fact he had to find out on his own means im a snake.

To an extent, i get where he’s coming from. His ex was involved so its automatically red flags. But it wasnt anything like that at all, and wasnt even supposed to go that way

In my head its like, Why as a young man do i have to tell you whats going on in my life? Im not trying to mess with ur ex, i was trying to hangout with a friend of hers who is also my friend. She was there, that isnt my fault. Why would i have to say something about that?

39,1g76qlj,AITA for wanting my partner and I to communicate plans and for having expectations?,"A bit of background first: My GF (I'll call her Elle) & I have been together for 20 years.  We are the same sort of age, I'm a couple of years older.  Like many couples who've been together since college we did some stupid stuff like cheating.  We moved past it & developed an adult relationship.  A few years ago I had an emotional affair (never met in person).  I then found out that Elle was having an affair with a coworker and I thought that was the end of us, but we worked through it.

To the outside, it looks bad, I'm just providing context.  People make mistakes.  We're not perfect.  We got together when we were young, did stupid shit, and have grown and matured together, then hit a rough patch where we both slipped up.

Anyway, that's the background.

I'm autistic and find socialising draining.  Elle is the opposite.  That's fine and I try to be as supportive as possible.  I struggle with intrusive thoughts & anxiety, and have had an awful couple of years.  With Elle's support, and some therapy, I started getting better.  Part of my therapy has been around trust in relationships, and part of it is around being ND in an NT world.

Elle made some friends in her new job including a married couple.  They've met up outside of work a few times.  I try where possible to not put my intrusive thoughts on Elle.  She picks up on it though, & asks me about it.  We have an open policy when it comes to our phones, computers, post etc.

The other day Elle went for a walk whilst I was WFH.  This is not unusual as we often go for walks alone or together.  When she got back she had a call from the guy in the married couple, and it turns out Elle had called him whilst out to see if he.wanted to meet up.  Again, I'm find with that in principle but I still have this raw spot when it comes to guys she works with. The rational part of my brain knows that and understands that, but on an emotional level it's difficult sometimes.

Elle knew something was up & asked me about it.  I didn't want to talk about it, but after being asked several times I brought up how she'd not mentioned calling this guy.  I said it wasn't a problem if they met up, but I wouldn't be comfortable if they met up and went to his house, for example.  This caused an argument & she said I was controlling and of not trusting her.

I tried to explain trust is not an either/or thing; it comes in levels.  I'd trust a stranger to watch my book in a cafe, but not my phone, for example. I wouldn't go to a female coworkers place for the two of us to hang out alone because I know what that looks like.

With being autistic I don't understand social stuff sometimes and I genuinely don't know if I'm being an asshole here.  Elle sent me a wall of text saying that she's angry/disappointed in me, & thought we were better than this.  On my side, I didn't initiate this argument.  I didn't want to discuss it, & instead wanted to try and deal in my head and in therapy.

Am I the asshole here?

Everyone is respectful and most of the time none of the kids have an issue with doing things as a blended family.

For about a year Ben and Alex both have wanted some more focus on their relationship with their dad vs the relationship with our blended family. They have expressed a wish to sometimes have just their parents for certain moments. Their mom was open to this, although reluctantly, but my husband was more reluctant because he didn't want to open the door to them leaving us out all the time. He felt like they were a little too enthusiastic about dividing the family and when asked, he admitted the fact both of them wanted it had him concerned it would lead to this.

In July Ben won an all day family (of four) ticket to an amusement park. He wanted to use it for his birthday and wanted both parents there. My husband said we'd pay for me and my kids to join in and we'd all be there. Ben was SO disappointed. Alex was disappointed on her brothers behalf.

Alex and I talked later and she told me they don't hate us (me and the kids) but they wish they just had some good memories of them with their parents. She said memories of family time always had someone missing; either dad or mom.

Last weekend was Ben's birthday and I told my husband beforehand that he should go and enjoy and they should use the four tickets and my kids and I would do something else. He was like no, we have to go as a family. I told him to give his kids a nice memory where they have both parents. I told him to do it for them. That his kids deserved it. He went very reluctantly and my kids were upset we weren't going too. I spoke to them and helped them to understand. It was still a little more difficult because they remember my husband and stepkids always being around. But they could still understand once explained. My stepkids had the best time. Ben was especially happy. My husband was surprised by just how well it went and how my stepkids had no issue being around us afterward. He admitted he still felt some guilt about it. Which his parents picked up on when we saw them the next day and they feel like I shouldn't have held back and I ""only created more trouble"". My husband told them to leave it and I wasn't wrong but he has also admitted he still has some mixed feelings on it. My ILs are very clear that they think I was wrong.

45,1g75nno,WIBTA for not attending my father in laws birthday?,"Me (25f) and my boyfriend ""Tom"" (27m) have been together for almost 2 years now. I will reffer to his father as father in law (FIL) for shortness reasons. 

I moved to my boyfriends city last year November, which is about 3 hours away from my parents and 4 hours away from my grandparents. between work and responsibilities, I don't get to see my family as much as I would like to, but whe see Toms family quite frequently, as they are living 10 minutes away. 

Every year, the last weekend in November, I visit my grandma and mum for a few days to do all our christmas baking because in my country, we celebrate the four sundays before christmas by lighting candles, singing songs, and as a family tradition, eat cookies. So they have to be ready on time. Since I moved of course, I'm not able to see them on these days, which is why it's so important for me to see them in November. Plan is as follows:

* Thursday after work - taking train to grandma
* friday- baking with GM
* saturday - rest of baking with GM and driving to mum
* sunday - baking with mum and driving home

I already took friday off, but when I reminded Tom about it today, he said I will have to cancel going on thursday because it is his dads birthday and they want to go to dinner. 

I looked at train schedules but sadly came to the conclusion that I would loose most of friday if I don't go on thursday after work and we would not be able to do all the things we usually do together. This is important to consider since my grandma can't really bake on her own anymore, so baking with me is kinda the only way we get everything done, and my mum is fresh off maternity leave, and with going back to work, her health and the stress of a little kid, I already can't support her as much as I would want to, so I would hate to cancel the christmas baking. Also, because it has been months since I last saw my family, I wouldn't want to rush the visit. Cancelling is also not an option, because every other weekend before are also birthdays, and afterwards it's already december and the first weekend we also have plans. 

Also, last year his dad didn't celebrate his birthday and Tom said he usually doesn't, so I just assumed this year would be the same. Normally, I would put a birthday first, but since it has been such a long time since I saw my family, especially grandparents, and I already don't get to participate in any other of out holiday traditions until I see them on christmas, I told Tom I would rather we invite his dad for a seperat dinner and I go to see my family as I originally planned.

He told me it would be an AH move and I get where he is coming from, but I also feel that my feelings about putting my family first are valid since it's ""because of him"" I don't get to see them much the rest of the year and while I don't blame him, I feel like he could be a bit more sympathetic to my situation.

46,1g75jqn,AITA for refusing to consider a middle name suggestion for my daughter?,"My (29m) wife (28f) is pregnant with our first child. We know we're having a girl and we have a first name already chosen. It's a name my wife has loved for so long and I think it's a great name too so it was decided we'd go with her top choice. Middle names are not something we have the strongest feelings about. My wife doesn't have a middle name. So we may go that same route. We may not. We're tossing around ideas.

Several of the people in my extended family suggested I should use my dad's late wife's late stepmother's name. To break that down for people. My dad was married to a woman ""Mary"" who was not my mom. Mary had divorced parents and her stepmother ""Ruth"" died around the same time my dad married Mary. Mary's kids were closer to Ruth than their bio grandmother. My dad and Mary's kids never knew Ruth but grew up hearing a lot about her and formed a closeness to her from that. I was not close to Mary while she was alive and married to my dad and I was not close to Ruth for the really brief time I ""knew"" her.

Mary's legal name was also Ruth but she went by Mary. So the name Ruth carries a lot of personal meaning to my dad and my step and half siblings. It carries no weight to me however. But they believe it should. My dad always felt that I should have loved Mary and regarded her as my second mom because I never knew mine (complicated situation). But I always saw her as my dad's wife and nothing more. I was 11 when they met and 12 when they got married.

The name was suggested and I told them we weren't looking to do honor names (which is true, we're not) and they said it would be a wonderful gesture especially given Mary and Ruth were not biologically related but had love and I could say the same. I told them it was nice to offer but one of the others could use it in the future instead. But they didn't like that and after a few more attempts at pushing the name I said I will absolutely not use the name as my daughter's middle name and they need to drop it because they cannot force me.

They are angry I was so forcefully against the name. My dad more than anyone because he said I was displaying my lack of affection or regard for the woman who helped raise me.

We got into an argument. He kept on calling me stubborn, and how I was being a bad daughter for not wearing a dress for 2 hours. I kept on trying to reason with him. It made me extremely uncomfortable as it was not only going to be itchy for those supposed 2 hours sitting in a chair, but also looked extremely ugly on me as the colour and overall look was personally disgusting on me.

I then asked if we could have everyone go but me and I'd buy a separate dinner for her on the 21st. He then asked me what I was doing, and I told him. He then said that it was not more important than this dinner. I continued to try to compromise by asking about a change in time for both things neither moved.

The day went great, we ate a lot and we sang songs together. Astrid had the idea of going to a playground at night and we did, it was pretty fun and we recorded a lot from it. When we returned we smoked cigarettes and I went to bed because my body didn’t allow me to stay awake. 

I fell asleep on the couch and woke up at 4 am to the feeling of eyeliner on my arms. I knew what they were doing. They drew on my face and arms after I told Val on a phone call i didn’t wanted that. 

I sat up and confronted them, starting to cry. They told me to be quieter because I could’ve woken someone up. I stormed to the bathroom and tried washing it off with water, but surprise, it was waterproof eyeliner. 

 Astrid came in and helped me wash it all off because my hands were too shaky. (They drew male anatomy on my forehead and arms)My skin was irritated and red after using makeup remover.

I left then and there, packed my stuff and went home. I didn’t told Val that I arrived because I was so mad at her.

51,1g7436u,AITA For Kicking my Mother out of my Wedding After She Brought my Ex as Her Plus One,"I (M30) started seeing June (F29) about 3 years ago. My mother has never really liked June for a couple reasons, the main one being the fact that June didn't let my mom push her around. She kept firm boundaries which I really admired and she even helped me do the same. My mom hated this, calling June controlling and wishing I hadn't broken up with my previous girlfriend Margo, who my mom loved. I was with Margo for 5 years and it was horrible. Margo was very controlling and manipulative and always guilted me into things I wasn't comfortable with. But thanks to support from friends and my sister, I was able to leave her. It was hard, but I had help and my life has improved since. My mom was very upset with this but relationships didn't last so she eventually let it go until I started dating June about a year later.

When June and I announced our engagement my mom didn't freak out, which was weird considering my mom hates June. She was very calm but I just took it as she was finally accepting this and so I didn't think much of it.

Everything was fine and smooth up until the wedding. I gave both my parents plus one’s to the wedding since they both remarried after I graduated college. So I’m not close to their spouses but gave them the option of inviting them.  We had a very small ceremony. Just immediate family and a few close friends. After the ceremony, me and June went to take pictures and then met back with everyone we invited to the reception which was pretty big. When we got there, My sister and June’s best friend/maid of honor ran up to us in a panic. Before they even said anything I spotted it. My mom was at the table with my dad, my dad's wife, and Margo.

I wanted to freak but June kept me calm. I walked over, pulled them both aside, and simply told them to leave. My mom tried to explain Margo and I are soulmates and June is just in the way of true love but I wasn't hearing it. I didn't care. Just got my best friends to escort them out and I returned to the party where luckily, after a few moments, I was able to relax and enjoy it.

I really didn't think this would all turn into something huge but me and June just got back from our honeymoon where we didn't have our phones, and seeing mine I saw hundreds of texts from multiple family members.

They all think I was an asshole for kicking my mom out of her only son's wedding. For the record, she was there for the ceremony but apparently was really upset she was kicked from the reception. Here's a summary of my family's thoughts. Some think I could have just ignored Margo and didn't have to “freak out.” A few others, including my dad, think I should have just kicked Margo and let my mom stay but after the stunt my mom pulled, I didn't want her there either.

I’m starting to second-guess myself since everyone is really mad. June and my sister are on my side but I fear my dad may be right and I should have just let my mom stay and made Margo leave.

So I’ve come to Reddit, AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-19,"AITA For Kicking my Mother out of my Wedding After She Brought my Ex as Her Plus One I (M30) started seeing June (F29) about 3 years ago. My mother has never really liked June for a couple reasons, the main one being the fact that June didn't let my mom push her around. She kept firm boundaries which I really admired and she even helped me do the same. My mom hated this, calling June controlling and wishing I hadn't broken up with my previous girlfriend Margo, who my mom loved. I was with Margo for 5 years and it was horrible. Margo was very controlling and manipulative and always guilted me into things I wasn't comfortable with. But thanks to support from friends and my sister, I was able to leave her.

54,1g73m2i,AITA for calling out my best friend in front of his childhood crush?,"I (21F) recently called out my best friend ""Larry"" (21M) in front of his long-time crush ""Debby"" (20F), and now I’m questioning if I went too far. We've known each other for over a decade, and Larry has always had a crush on Debby, though he never asked her out, fearing it would ruin their friendship. Recently, Larry found out that Debby DEFINITELY isn't interested in a relationship because she said she doesn't want long-distance (most of our friend group, including Larry and I, live in the same country, while D and a few others have moved abroad). Larry said he respected her boundary, but instead of moving on, his behavior has worsened.

He only hangs out or joins calls with our group if Debby is involved and cancels plans with us to follow her schedule. He becomes defensive when called out. I’ve talked to him about it, and while he’s admitted to the behavior, he falls back into the same patterns.

One night, I joined a call with Larry, Debby, and another friend, ""Rob."" I had a stressful week and wanted to relax. Larry canceled our bar plans but offered to play games, so I suggested a specific game. Larry declined until Debby expressed interest, and then he immediately agreed. During the game, Larry ignored Rob and me, scolded us for mistakes but gave Debby a pass, and made jokes at our expense. He made fun of my slow processing (which I’ve confided in him about, as I was in special ed classes growing up and was bullied heavily bc of it) and mocked Rob’s recent unemployment. When we tried to tease him back, he got defensive and told us to shut up.

After the game, I was emotionally drained and must have sighed into the mic because Larry sarcastically joked, “Was that game really that hard on you?” Debby defended me, but I cut her off and snapped at Larry. I told him his favoritism toward Debby was annoying and selfish, that he should’ve gotten over her by now, and that it was hurting our friendships. I listed examples and ended by calling his need for validation trumping over relationships he's had with others for decades was shitty, stupid and a little “creepy” before leaving the call.

Most of our friends, especially Rob, supported my reaction but thought I should’ve handled it privately, especially with Debby there. Two friends were angry and said I was wrong for outing Larry’s long-time crush in front of Debby, which I agree with. Larry hasn’t reached out to anyone since that night, and I haven’t reached out to him either. D later texted me, apologizing and saying she’d noticed Larry’s behavior but didn’t realize it was due to his crush (she’s known for a while apparently). I apologized to her if I embarrassed her.

Now, I feel guilty for exposing Larry’s secret and calling him out in front of someone he’s emotionally vulnerable with. It’s been two weeks, and I’m torn on how to feel.

About maybe 2 weeks ago P, W and I were going to go out and trick or treat for halloween and L asked if she could tag along (this was before i had any idea what was going on) and I said sure. P and W both messaged me last week saying that they are no longer going to go because L will be there.

56,1g738dh,AITA for not believing my partner isn't lying and for reacting emotionally/nastily?,"My partner (f22) and I (f24) have been in a ldr for almost 2 years. Last weekend we were supposed to confirm plans for meeting for the first time and hanging out during our anniversary next year. The weekend before that we had started discussing it/looking into it, but we agreed to confirm everything the following weekend. 

That entire week was full of excited discussions and my partner never seemed hesitant/like she was going to change her mind. Then Saturday morning came and she tried to avoid the topic and didn't say she was no longer on board until I pressed for what was going on.

After I pressed, she started giving excuse after excuse about why she couldn't meet up while claiming she wanted to. Her main excuse was working out her uni stuff (academic probation/degree change). However, she knew about this before we started discussing meeting up. She's been avoiding sorting it out. She has had months to work this stuff out. And her big excuse about not meeting up is not wanting to mess anything up with uni and not being able to enjoy it because of stress. 

But, these excuses and sudden switch up from the entire week and even the day before, really upset me. And I do not believe that she did not lie and lead me on for a week because her excuses just don't add up. And I was also going to be covering all flights and accommodation costs so she would not have needed to save as much. Plus I'd just put a deposit on a custom engagement ring the previous day (I was dumb. I know.). All this to say, my reactions were very emotional and I got very nasty at one point. I said some true things in a very nasty way that I knew would hurt her and that's why I said them because at the time I wanted her to hurt and feel even half as hurt and betrayed as I was feeling. 

Since then we have barely talked. She has largely been ignoring my messages. 

Some additional information:

I pay rent and struggle financially and have deferred my studies to focus on work due to those financial issues and thanks to work and the time I'm taking off I finally have some savings and time to meet my partner. And, her forced gap year means that we could have met up for once with nothing in the way. 

She does not pay any rent/bills. Her parents cover everything. Even tuition but now she suddenly wants to pay her own tuition. 

My family know about her. Her family don't know about me/that she is queer.

We live in different countries. 

She also always never ""intends"" to hurt me. Just like how that week of what I consider lies and being led on, she considers as not that. And that she's not in the wrong. 

I have a lot of things going on outside of this that started even before this. So I was really looking forward to this for multiple reasons.

These past couple of weeks, I haven’t heard any noises from the kids next door. I think since school started, they probably want to stay inside.

59,1g72zs5,AITA for making a stupid and inappropriate joke to a coworker?,"My (26F) boyfriend (26M) is currently angry with me for telling what I thought was a harmless joke at work. 

For context, I work in a very male-dominated field, being the only female among 150 men for the past 8 years. It’s been challenging to fit in, gain respect, and avoid harassment, but it’s also helped me grow thicker skin. Some of my coworkers treat me like ""one of the guys"" or a ""little sister,"" (their words). Which is fine as long as I’m respected as a human and a supervisor.

A little over a month ago, I had a serious surgery. Recovery was painful, and I was on leave for just over a month. Before returning to work, I told my boyfriend I was nervous about how to respond when asked about my surgery, because those guys can be nosey. I planned to just say, “some GI stuff,” because the real answer felt too personal.

We joked about funny responses like, “Oh! I got a boob job, duh” (ironic bc I'm the president of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee) or “I got a BBL, isn’t it obvious?”. I thought responding like that would be a funny way to deviate from the question/answer. Right?? He laughed when I said them.

At work, when a coworker asked about my surgery, I went with the BBL joke. We both laughed, and I found it a little ironic too because I was wearing a hoodie and baggy sweatpants, so no curves were showing. I didn’t think much of it until I told my boyfriend later that night. I expected him to laugh too—but he didn’t. Instead, he told me it was inappropriate and unprofessional. I agree with him to an extent.

The environment that my job fosters is that of, for lack of better words, a structured frat house. They can be professional but also immature, inappropriate, and sometimes toxic...and while I've done my very best to stray away from those negative traits, we are all products of our own environments.

Given that context, I thought the joke was harmless, but my boyfriend felt it crossed a line. He said it disrespected our relationship because “he knows how men think” and believed I was flirting or seeking male validation and thinks I was inviting my coworker to ""check me out"".

I understand why he feels that way, but I feel like my intention matters too. I wasn’t being flirtatious, just trying to be funny. But to him, it doesn’t matter because, in his view, it’s “unequivocally wrong.” Now, he’s questioning all my past interactions with coworkers, worrying if I’ve crossed other lines that I didn’t realize at the time.

So, AITA?

And even if I’m not, how do I fix this? How do I prove to him that I thought the joke was innocent and that he can trust me?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-19,"AITA for making a stupid and inappropriate joke to a coworker? My (26F) boyfriend (26M) is currently angry with me for telling what I thought was a harmless joke at work. 

For context, I work in a very male-dominated field, being the only female among 150 men for the past 8 years. It’s been challenging to fit in, gain respect, and avoid harassment, but it’s also helped me grow thicker skin. Some of my coworkers treat me like ""one of the guys"" or a ""little sister,"" (their words). Which is fine as long as I’m respected as a human and a supervisor.

A little over a month ago, I had a serious surgery. Recovery was painful, and I was on leave for just over a month. Before returning to work, I told my boyfriend I was nervous about how to respond when asked about my surgery, because those guys can be nosey. I planned to just say, “some GI stuff,” because the real answer felt too personal.

We joked about funny responses like, “Oh! I got a boob job, duh” (ironic bc I'm the president of the Itty Bitty Titty Committee) or “I got a BBL, isn’t it obvious?”. I thought responding like that would be a funny way to deviate from the question/answer. Right?? He laughed when I said them.

At work, when a coworker asked about my surgery, I went with the BBL joke. We both laughed, and I found it a little ironic too because I was wearing a hoodie and baggy sweatpants, so no curves were showing. I didn’t think much of it until I told my boyfriend later that night. I expected him to laugh too—but he didn’t. Instead, he told me it was inappropriate and unprofessional. I agree with him to an extent.

The environment that my job fosters is that of, for lack of better words, a structured frat house. They can be professional but also immature, inappropriate, and sometimes toxic...and while I've done my very best to stray away from those negative traits, we are all products of our own environments.

63,1g724c5,AITA for telling my friend she should have told me about a roach infestation before I moved in?,"Hey, I would like some insight on a situation I’m currently dealing with. I recently moved to my hometown and my friend had an extra room that she offered to me. She said I didn’t have to pay for rent as long as I helped with her 5 year old and 11 month year old and helped with paying utilities, I of course initially said I would pay rent before this offer but agreed to help with other things. I called her beforehand to discuss what expectations and house rules she had but she said “nothing, I’m easy.” So I left it at that. Fast forward, the day I move my stuff into the garage, she tells me pest control in doing a treatment because of some roaches so I think ok, like normal. That happens. Well no, I moved in 2 days later and it’s a severe roach infestation. Nothing like I have ever seen before and the house is also quite filthy. The day I moved my stuff into the garage I didn’t go upstairs to see the room because I was so tired and she had shown me most of the apartment on facetime. Anyway, the roach situation is pretty heinous. All over the walls, in the pantry, all over the sofa, the floor, counters, I mean it was bad. I cleaned for 3 days and found dead roaches in the fridge under the fresh drawers and roach eggs under her baby’s high chair cushion, I mean it was evident nothing had ever really been cleaned in there.

So today I finally told her I’m moving out after being there 2 weeks and that I wish she told me about the problem beforehand. She reacted poorly, said I’m not kind, I have negative energy, and called me rude and condescending.

64,1g71ty0,AITA for confronting my family and feeling the way I did about them?,"So I don’t want to give too much info out as to possible damage it can cause, but I’m 20 and I have a large family.

Throughout my life there has been abuse and a bunch of other things. And I ended up in foster care when I was 13 and got out as an adult.

One of the biggest things I can use as an example is when I was in foster care, I felt like no one cared. To me, it felt like my whole family was just being lazy and not wanting to go through the process of court to having me visit out of state or for a week or so. I felt alone and not cared for and I was listening to my little sister getting to go out of state with family and yes I was jealous, but no one told me what was really going on.

I have uncovered so much during my two years as an adult and what really happened when I was in foster care.

Long story short, as I’m now 20 I literally found out two weeks ago that one of a close family member to me did try to have those things happen and multiple people did try to get through to my caseworker. Now I’m perplexed.

I do feel incredibly guilty for all the things I’ve said to my family who I thought didn’t care and didn’t try when they did, and I’m supposed to have a phone call with a close family member too and it was about establishing a relationship and talking about that stuff and I do plan on apologizing on my behalf but I just gotta know, am I the A-hole for being mad and confused at my family  and saying the things I did to them when I had no idea what was going on until I was 20?

65,1g71qxp,AITA for telling my mom I don’t want her talking bad about my dad,"Growing up, my (16f) dad (54m), was pretty emotionally absent. He was a bipolar alcoholic with anger issues and would constantly start arguments. My mom had a divorce with him when I was 13. Since then, he’s slowly gotten better with his anger, cutting down on alcoholic and spend time with me and spends a lot of money on me despite only seeing me every other weekend.

Ever since the divorce, my mom (54f) has been telling me about how she thinks he’s a narcissist, how he’s gaslit her, poked fun at her and all sorts of terrible things that weren’t necessarily true or untrue.


Lately, as my dad has been much better, and my mom still says terrible things about him, I’m noticing not all of it’s true. Especially the narcissist accusation. And it really hurts. As much as my dad’s previous parenting hurts, and hurt her, I think she needs to let go. It’s almost like she’s trying to convince me all the good things he does is lies, and that it will all end end that he’s just doing it because he’s lonely and doesn’t want to lose me.

I know this isn’t true, I know he really cares about me and he’s actually admitted to the bad things he’s done to us growing up. We sat down and talked about it and he was tearing up. 

So, considering this I have multiple times sat down with her and asked her to stop talking about my dad altogether. I had to keep bringing it up because she kept doing it. Atp I don’t know what to do. I understand she’s hurt, and also pissed at the things he currently does, such as won’t pick me up from my new school because it’s too far, called her a cunt for leaving me when I was in a very Vulnerable state, and other things.

my boyfriends mom organized the whole idea of this house warming and i know i do get a say in it as well but to be frank, i don’t want my moms friends at this party.

70,1g711p0,AITA for doing what my friend told me not to do?,"I (16F) have a friend about my age. My friend has a bf, who is my bsf brother.

A few months ago my friend disclosed something to me which raised alarms. She told me not to tell anyone, considering some factors I can’t say for legal reasons.

The other day I was chilling in the office (we’re in high school) and I accidentally told one of the security members.

The security member walked out of the room for a few minutes, came back, then asked me to follow her. We went into a room which had the principal, a few cops, and a few more members of security.

They asked me to retell the story and I did, forgetting I promised her. They asked me for her name and I froze, remembering our promise. I stayed quiet and refused to answer anymore questions.

A cop in the room recognized me from a few years back when he worked on my late bsf’s case. He reassured me that I was helping her out. I broke and told them her name.

That specific day, my friend wasn’t at school so they couldn’t talk to her. 

The thing is, I’m the only one she told since we were the remaining of our freshman year friend group, (we’re juniors now) so I’m the #1 person she trust. When they talk to her they’ll have CPS, the cops, her parents, and a few members of staff in the room with her. She’ll know it was me which might ultimately ruin our friendship.

She’s the one person I like at school and without her I’ll have no one. So AITA?

I know half of this is irrelevant but I just wanna know if ITA

71,1g70qjv,AITA for acting really closed off at family dinners and hating when my parents are affectionate towards each other,"Hey guys, sorry if this is formatted weird and it’s so long this is my first post ever and I could really use outside perspectives. 

So for some context my F(14) parents never had a good marriage. My father was an alcoholic (now recovered) and mentally abusive and my mother was mainly mentally abusive. They would often fight and it would end with them screaming at each other, my dad throwing something and running to the garage to drink, and my mom coming to my room to vent to me and complain about how horrible my dad is. Now this cycle happened since I was around 7 so I think it really messed with my perception of healthy relationships and love in general. 

Since covid it’s been REALLY bad so my parents announced that they were separating. Which to them meant living in separate houses but still being “married”. Since that most of the times when my parents see each other they hug and kiss. And I hate when they do this like I just get so annoyed at the fact they act like they’re still a happy couple. I think it might be because just last year my dad would drink till he crashed his truck into our garage and my mom sobbed to me about how much she hated him and how abusive he was. I think something deep inside of me doesn’t believe they should be together or get to act like they love each other after all that. And I know that they are probably trying to change and work things out but still. (Sorry if this doesn’t make sense it’s hard to form my feelings into words)

It all came to a head tonight when we went out to a restaurant for my birthday dinner. Now I have never liked family dinners, maybe because of the previously mentioned reasons maybe not, and I haven’t really expressed this sentiment to anyone in my family. Anyways I was being pretty quiet, just being generally in my head because I didn’t feel like I had anything positive to add. Also I was already having a pretty shitty week so this was the last place I wanted to be. And I thought this was fine until my dad and brother had to leave the dinner early and my mom turned to me and asked why I was being such a brat. She then went off on me for “sulking” and how I was ruining every conversation I was part of and ruining the dinner. When I said I was sorry and that I was tired she yelled at me more for not compartmentalizing my feelings well. So I told her that I don’t like family dinners nowadays she then said I was being selfish and brought up the fact that we don’t have many left because my brothers going off to college soon and that I should be taking advantage of what little time we have left.

Was my mom right about me being selfish for being so cagey about family dinners and my parents acting in love? Am I just being an overreacting teenager? Should I try and ignore the resentful feelings? Any opinions would be wonderful.

73,1g70a20,AITA for not helping my boyfriend after he had a car accident? ,"My boyfriend was in a car accident. He broke his left leg, ankle and forearm, and he'll be out of comission for at least nine months. Overall he's OK and I'm glad and thankful for it. 

_So why aren't you helping him?_ Because I said I wouldn't and I'm sticking to my guns but it's getting harder to do so everyday. 

You see, my boyfriend is a reckless driver. He eats, drinks (not alcohol; doesn't like beer or spirits) and is always on his cell phone whenever he's driving. It's been a point of contention ever since I met him to point that I've either taken the wheel or left him and taken an Uber home because I didn't felt safe. Ironically, he's never been stopped or gotten a ticket over it. 

_So why did you said you weren't going to help him?_ About three months ago, we were coming back from a weekend getaway, and while he was driving, he was watching a race on cell phone, a race! I offered to take the wheel so he could enjoy it but said no. **We got into a huge fight and it ended when I said that if he were to get into an accident, no matter how bad, I wouldn't help him.** 

He got quiet and we made it back home safely. 

Fast forward nine weeks later, he has an accident, a big one. He lost control and rolled over hitting a tree rigth on the driver's side. He spent two weeks in the hospital and was discharged a few days ago. 

During his time in the hospital, he confessed to me that he was distracted by his cell phone, which wasn't surprising. Since he lives by himself, it's been quite difficult to go on with his life. I visit him but I don't help him and while it does hurt me, I am standing firm with my promise. He got himself into this situation, why should I have to pay for it? 

On top of that, his family is all over me and quite displeased that I am not over there. Since all of them live miles away from where he is, they can't be there to help him. My boyfriend is understandibly angry with me but I can't bring myself to be there for him even after all the warning I told him. 

So here I am, asking if IATA here, and if I am, I'll bring myself around and be there for him. 

**AITA here? Should I help my injured boyfriend after all of this?**

You judgement is quite appreciated. 

_Addendum No. 1: To his credit, he's been apologetic and thankful for being alive. He cares little about what happened to his car (2022 Kia Sorento). He has a nurse that comes by to check on him and his parents hired a housekeeper who helps him clean and prepare meals._

_Addendum No. 2: Why hasn't his family been there for him? Both of his parents still work full-time (lawyers), his brother is in college and his sister is ten-years old. They have visited but don't stay too long. I know little about his extended family. His friends visit once in a while, even his former girlfriend (the one before me). They all just visit but don't help, just spend time and leave._

I was on my phone waiting for people to be done settling in for bed, and noticed the sister giving me hard side-eye but not saying anything to me. I just smiled at her because she has a little bit of RBF so I assumed it wasn’t a dirty look.

The next morning was chill, I went home and thought nothing more of it. Then I get a text from the roommate whose sister was out with us that “[younger sister] is pissed you slept in her spot last night. she ended up sleeping with me haha” Now this girl has a decided attitude with me and I feel guilty for ruining a couple peoples’ sleep.

77,1g6yss3,AITA for changing my phone password and revoking my GF's access to it.,"I (29M) have been dating my GF (25) for around a year.

2 months ago she had asked to grab a picture of us that I took on my phone so just gave her my password and didn't really think much of it as things have been going good for awhile. Since then I have seen her a few times playing a game on my phone (paid ones that she doesn't want to pay for) and didn't really care that she had access to it. I just assumed that she was playing games on it.

I have a group of friends from college that we still text daily with lots of in jokes in a group chat. GF knows about the friends and has met most of them but I don't really tell her what we talk about because most of it is inside jokes. 

Well last night GF and I were talking and she makes one of the inside jokes. I didn't remember telling her this so I asked if I had and she says she read my buddy making the joke in the group chat. For me that was surprising as I just never really expected her to snoop like that. Most of my life people have had access to stuff but as far as I know never exploited that and in certain cases at least I would have known if they had.

I asked my GF about it and she was very open that she's gone through texts from months ago, gone through all my photos, videos, messenger apps, pretty much my whole phone and she has used it a lot of times even when I wasn't aware. She said she likes learning about me.

I did get upset and tell her that I felt that my entire privacy was violated. She argued that the thing about us sharing that stuff is that we aren't keeping secrets or needing the privacy and that we communicate everything. I have had every opportunity to go through her phone but honestly I never felt the need. I never really felt she was being dishonest or keeping secrets or anything.

We argued over it and eventually I slept in the other room and during the night changed my phone password and turned of facial recognition. I told her I did it this morning as I do need my own privacy and she was very upset and refused to talk to me all day. Honestly no idea where she is right now so I just need to know if I am the asshole for what I did?

Edit: I do want to clarify one thing because a lot of people have said she was being sneaky by not telling me before. She did point out how she has made other references in the past to inside jokes or stories from the group chat but I guess I didn't clock those because I don't always remember which stories I have and have not told her or which inside jokes we've talked about. A year into the relationship I guess I'm not the best at remembering what I have shared with her as we talk alot. This one just caught my attention as it was an inside joke that only came back into play recently and I had actually forgotten about before my friend reintroduced it so it seemed weird to me that I wouldn't have remembered telling her this one.  I truly don't believe she was trying to be sneaky with this.

I have a group of friends from college that we still text daily with lots of in jokes in a group chat. GF knows about the friends and has met most of them but I don't really tell her what we talk about because most of it is inside jokes. 

Well last night GF and I were talking and she makes one of the inside jokes. I didn't remember telling her this so I asked if I had and she says she read my buddy making the joke in the group chat. For me that was surprising as I just never really expected her to snoop like that. Most of my life people have had access to stuff but as far as I know never exploited that and in certain cases at least I would have known if they had.

I asked my GF about it and she was very open that she's gone through texts from months ago, gone through all my photos, videos, messenger apps, pretty much my whole phone and she has used it a lot of times even when I wasn't aware. She said she likes learning about me.

I did get upset and tell her that I felt that my entire privacy was violated. She argued that the thing about us sharing that stuff is that we aren't keeping secrets or needing the privacy and that we communicate everything. I have had every opportunity to go through her phone but honestly I never felt the need. I never really felt she was being dishonest or keeping secrets or anything.

We argued over it and eventually I slept in the other room and during the night changed my phone password and turned of facial recognition. I told her I did it this morning as I do need my own privacy and she was very upset and refused to talk to me all day. Honestly no idea where she is right now so I just need to know if I am the asshole for what I did?

Edit: I do want to clarify one thing because a lot of people have said she was being sneaky by not telling me before. She did point out how she has made other references in the past to inside jokes or stories from the group chat but I guess I didn't clock those because I don't always remember which stories I have and have not told her or which inside jokes we've talked about. A year into the relationship I guess I'm not the best at remembering what I have shared with her as we talk alot. This one just caught my attention as it was an inside joke that only came back into play recently and I had actually forgotten about before my friend reintroduced it so it seemed weird to me that I wouldn't have remembered telling her this one.  I truly don't believe she was trying to be sneaky with this. Its a big part of why I feel so conflicted.",0.0,0.04173717,0,1
78,1g6yshm,AITA for telling my mom it wasn't cute or funny to dress me as a hot dog instead of a princess? ,"So there's this new Target commercial going around where a little girl dresses as a hot dog, and it came on while my family was watching a scary movie. I (20F) am home from college for the weekend and brought my boyfriend, and my mother (57F) decided it would be hilarious to mention that she'd made me a hot dog costume as a kid, except the way she told the story, it was my request. She said that all the girls wanted to be Disney princesses, but I had asked to be a hot dog, and so she'd gone out of her way to make me that costume. 

This is not what happened, and I said as much. What actually happened is that I wanted to be Snow White, and had told everyone, including the teachers, that I was going to be Snow White. I was obsessed with that movie as a kid, to the point where I would actually get invested in doing chores because I was cleaning up just like Snow White. My dad and I would watch that movie all the time, and I was very excited to be Snow White for Halloween, especially because my ballet studio was doing a special ""princess dance,"" for Halloween and we'd all signed up for special princess slots, and I'd shown up early with my dad the week before so I could get to be Snow White. 

My mother decided that she wanted to be quirky and that Snow White was a bad role model after I got in trouble for trying to cook dinner for my family. I was about eight, and I tried to make hot dogs, like how she made food for the dwarves in the movie, and I made a mess. My mom ""surprised"" me on the day of with this crappy hot dog suit, and told me if I didn't wear it she'd never let me watch Snow White again. She took a million pictures, the other girls teased me for months, and it was one of the most humiliating moments of my childhood. 

I told the real story, and mentioned that I got through the day by pretending that she was the evil queen making me dress in rags, but the rags happened to be a garbage meat costume. She got really quiet after that, and after we left, my brother says she was crying and looking at the pictures from that Halloween. I didn't want to make my mom cry, but it's a shitty memory for me and it felt like she was trying to humiliate me all over again in front of my boyfriend.

79,1g6xz8a,"AITA for self-diagnosing, then asking my parents to bring me to a psychologist for an actual ADHD diagnosis?","I (17) am pretty sure I have ADHD.

I have been interested in psychology since the age of 9 or so, and of all the videos I watched from people talking about their lived experiences, and reading through the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria and reading articles, nothing resonated with me until I started research on ADHD.  
While I have been a ""gifted kid"" all my life, it always felt like I had to put twice as much trying as everyone else to get things done, and since I kept doing things last minute, I never really could put in the effort I wanted to into my schoolwork. I felt I couldn't trust others talking about this because of how easy it could be chalked up to lazyness from people who don't get it, especially since from the outside I seem to be handling things well.

I was fifteen when I decided to talk to my parents, having collected information on my symptoms seriously for a year; the way it happened was odd. I did not sit down with my parents to ask them to talk, instead, I was rambling to my mom about the topic of psychology in general and she asked if I thought I was neurodivergent, and I answered yes. We postponed any talks to when dad came home from work, since it was an important thing.

Now, I am not from the US, and in my country neurodiversity is VERY underdiagnosed, and my parents aren't really understanding of it, but I thought maybe if I had a conversation the issue would sort itself out. But I forgot that my mom in particular can be really harsh with what she disagrees with. So when we actually got around that conversation, my parents got angry at me despite my mom having been pretty neutral earlier.  
They told me that I was making light of these disorders, I shouldn't trust what I watch on social media, that my grades were good so I couldn't be struggling and I just had to get on the right mindset and do things.  
They would not let me get a word in after that initial explanation. Two years later, I still believe I have it.

Since, my mother has even used going to the psychologist as a threat against me, using it not for trying to help me, but saying that If I believe I am crazy I should go to one (I can't on my own). She has asked repeatedly if still want to go to one, and I have answered no, until recently.

To keep it short and relevant, me and my mom had a huge argument over reasons completely detached from the topic, and she brought up the question of if I wanted to see a psychologist again in a way that was clearly mocking, all because I was visibly stressed at her yelling at me, and this time I snapped and said yes, then went to my room and refused to answer any further questions.

She started telling me how I know we don't have the money for this and that I was being selfish for answering yes.

I have been trying to rebuild a relationship with him lately, and i live overseas so they came to visit us with the mother and my little brother. We have been hosting them with my wife and seems that everything went well, but we got into a heated fight since he gave a negative comment about my hosting, but i feel i have done everything to offer them great vacation. Sometimes i feel that i am too sensitive to his comments and almost like seek revenge for my childhood. What makes situation super hard is that there is my mother always trying to keep family unity, but when there is slight misalignment i start to feel all the negative emotions from my childhood and go off the rails. Also when i was living only with my mother, my mother was always talking so negative about him. I suppose i should visit therapy as well to get over this, but i just wanted to know what Reddit thinks. I guess there are a lot of details unmentioned.",0.0,0.0017479223,0,1
85,1g6wqys,AITA for not taking my friend to get bleach,"Hello, first ever post here - 
I was bleaching my friends hair as she wants to dye it pink, it took me an hour to do and she ran out of bleach (I didn’t use a tonne I was actually quite sparing). I only missed a tiny spot and her bangs. 
She asked me to drive down and go get more bleach, I currently am suffering from burnout after working 15 hours per day everyday for two weeks and I get two days this week where I don’t have to work, there’s no way I was going to leave the house today, in fact I thought it was kind of me to even spend an hour doing her hair and I’ll need to spend another hour dying it pink.
She is now angry at me and almost started crying because I wouldn’t go and get her bleach so my poor boyfriend had to go down because she didn’t want to walk into the shop with her hair half done which I think is ridiculous. 
I let her use my house and water, I feed her I don’t understand why me not wanting to leave the house on my day off is so bad?!

86,1g6wdh9,AITAH for undermining my Mum’s trauma for the benefit of my Brother with ADD,"My brother (19 M), has Autism Spectrum Disorder (typo in the title) and just moved into Uni 3 or 4 weeks ago now. You might describe him as being a late social bloomer, meaning whereas most people tend to push boundaries for independence around about 11 years old, my brother only started pushing this boundary in the last couple years and was sheltered until very recently.

Mum has always kept a VERY close eye on him, to the point where he has Find My installed on his phone and she uses it to track him for her peace of mind (she has a notification set for whenever he leaves his halls). Mum lost her first child at a very young age, so has always been incredibly protective of us. Essentially anything that puts him at ANY sort of risk is disallowed completely.

My view is that he’s not had and is not getting the same life experiences that most young adults (including me at his age) have had, so he should be allowed to have these experiences and learn from them. He was recently asked for a lighter, which he doesn’t carry, and though a little flustered he came out unscathed and knows how to respond next time.

My Mum on the other hand insists he has poor judgement and situational awareness, and that he is vulnerable of being taken advantage of. She says if he were to see a shady person walking down the street he wouldn’t notice and would walk straight into danger. My partner and I dispute this as he has always been VERY cautious in general, so we think he’d be more savvy in situations like this. Mum’s fear is not unfounded as he did have a real problem with being picked on by beggars in our hometown before he moved to uni as he was kind enough to give them money, so they marked him as an easy and generous target. My counterpoint is that because he had that experience, he now knows how to respond if it comes up again.

From our point of view, he’s being denied the opportunities he needs to develop into a fully functioning and independent adult. To make matters worse we now feel we are being dragged into this and being guilt-tripped into enabling my Mum’s side which we don’t agree with (I do have examples and will discuss in comments if anyone asks).

This topic comes up on almost on a daily basis now, he wants to do something that anyone else his age would be doing without a second thought, we encourage him to do it, and then Mum shoots him down by putting her anxieties in his head and he ends up not doing it to save her worrying.

I’ve spoken to him, I know he wants to be more independent and is capable of doing so, I’m trying to act as an advocate for him when he doesn’t feel he can stick up for himself. My concern however is that Mum’s worries obviously stem from some unresolved trauma from having lost her baby, so I don’t want to be too dismissive or critical of her but I feel a line has to be drawn for his sake.

88,1g7lx26,AITA for moving across the country and splitting the five of us up (Quints)?,"\*\*Update\*\*

Thank you all for the wonderful responses.  I apologize for not being able to answer all of your responses.  I truly didn’t think this was going to go as far as it did.  My boyfriend Will suggested that I do this and he warned me that Reddit is either a good friend or not so much.  While I lost track of the comments I saw a couple that stood out to me that I wanted to address.

I get that Quints are rare but something that always needs to be taken into consideration is that family history plays a huge part in it. My moms family is known for multiple births.  My mom was single but her mother had two sets of twins and one of those twins had a set of triplets. Mom and dad had been trying for a while and was going through fertility treatments and got pregnant for us.

Also Doctors and hospitals are not mandated reporters when it comes to the media.  If my mom learned one thing with her mom is that the public and people can be rude, entitled and all out mean when it comes to this type of thing. When we were little one women came up and demanded to touch our heads for luck.  About the time we were due there were a couple of other high profile families and births. Mom watched as the families turned their families into a media circus and vowed that wasn’t going to be us.  My parents did everything they could to make sure we had our own individual personalities and be own ow people right down the point of sending us to different schools so that we could meet our own friends and not be grouped together. I think out of the five of us I’m the one who took that to the extreme.   

Mom called me today and told me she wanted all of us for a family meeting.  She asked me to come early because they wanted to talk to me about the move and get my time line and they wanted me to just all together confront my siblings. Before anyone asks about confronting my parents.  They are good.  The apologized and held themselves accountable for their part.  I don’t have a problems with them.

My goal is to be moved by end of December while I’m off for Christmas and New Years.  Since I work from home I don’t think this will be a problem.  Mom and dad told me that they are going to help as well. So I have a good support group for that alone since Will is also going to help out.  I’m going to fly out next week and start looking for a place.  The only thing my parents asked for was for at least Christmas which I'm going to try for. 

I finally called out my siblings.  Specifically Aiden and his wife.  I addressed them by saying that they were blaming me for tearing the group apart.  I told them this was not true and looked directly at Jamie and told her that she started it.  I told her that she started it by not putting her foot down and saying I needed to be there.  That Aiden let it go by not demanding that I be there since it was his wedding as well.  And then I looked at Beth, Charlotte and Deanna and told them they sealed the casket by not refusing the invitation to the wedding party.  I told them the only two who made their amends were mom and dad and that dad at least offered to skip the wedding and spend the day with me.  But your welcome because I told him that both parents needed to be there.  I told them that since then I really don’t know who to feel about them.  I told them that because of this I honestly don’t even try to interact with them anymore because I feel like I hold such little value to them that why bother.  And I took it a step further.  I told them that Will and I have been together and if we get married none of them will be invited.  I may have taken that one a little too far.  But at least they know where we all stand with each other.

Also.  I was drunk last night when I did this.  It was three tries to post because I had to chop so much off of it because of the character limit.  Will said that I should be able to post an edit.  Again thank you for all the wonderful comments.  There is no way I’ll be able to respond to all of them.  And I’m looking in to figuring out how to create a “Be your own Wombat” shirts.

I’m 1 (28 M) of 5 in a set of quintuplets.  In order it goes Aiden, Beth, Charlotte, Deanna and me Eric. It wasn’t horrible and our parents did in all honesty a great job with all us.  I think really the only problem we had was Aiden who was the first out and knew he was the first out had a pretty big ego and felt he was superior over the other four of us and tried to push us around. Our parents did what they could to keep him inline and for the most part the rest of us would ignore him

Three years ago my brother decided to marry his then girlfriend. Our family for the most part are pretty laid back. This is good because out of the five of us, I’m the gay one. Up to a certain point it was never really an issue.  Or so I thought.   His wife’s family complete opposite. Highly political (Conservative) and devote Catholic. Again to each their own and it wasn’t anything for us to talk to him about.  If she makes him happy then there isn’t anything we can do about it.  When they got married I wasn’t included in any part of it.  Her parents were paying for it and they had the final say and said they couldn’t allow a gay person in the wedding party or in the church. My brothers, sisters and parents say they fought to get me invited, but were shot down each time.  My sisters were part of the wedding party but none declined.  My dad offered to stay with me for the day and we would do something.  I told him it was okay and both parents needed to be at the wedding.  The day of the wedding a couple of friends took a day trip.  We had a great time but it still would have been nice to see Aiden get married.

Not long after the wedding I was on vacation and met someone.  Long distance as it maybe three years later we have been making it work.  We have been talking about one of moving and I told him I loved Seattle and that if anyone was going to move it was going to be me.

Last night mom and dad asked for all of us to come for dinner.  I didn’t say much at all and everyone was talking and I was just listening and on occasion say a yes or no or answer an easy question. My dad finally noticed and looked over and asked if I was okay.  I just told him I have a lot on my mind and he asked what’s going on “I’m moving to Seattle  The room went crazy.  I can’t say I was being attacked but it still felt like it with the way everyone was firing off all their questions and calling me an asshole for breaking the five of us up. Dinner ended shortly after and Dad and I went out to his barn and talked for a long time.  Weather he gave it to me or not I am going to move.  But he gave me his blessing and told me he would help however he could.

Today Deanna and Beth came over and started in right away.  They started blaming Will for splitting the five of us up and calling me an asshole for not taking the rest of us into consideration. I told them it’s not a big deal and at least one of us has the ambition to move on with their life.

89,1g7lvyr,AITA for dropping kids in front of the entrance? ,"

So. Every Halloween in my town, we have this big event where people come from all over and the entire street for miles and miles and miles is packed.

It’s a main street, there are multiple police, and traffic directors everywhere. 

There is nowhere to park.  Every year, i drop the kids at the end of the very very long line.  I stop the car in front of the event and let them out providing there are no other cars coming.  

If I don’t do this, they will have to walk for miles to get to the end of the line.  It’s dark, crowded and safer (imo) to let the  off at the end of the line. 

Tonight, I did the same I always do, and traffic directors started screaming at me saying I was going to get the kids killed.  There were no cars coming from either direction and I said to him it’s your job to direct traffic.  He yelled at me that I was crazy and nuts. 

Am I the asshole for dropping the kids off instead of letting them walk?

Edit: apparently I’m the asshole for not making this post more clear.  
I DID NOT have them CUT THE LINE.  I dropped them at the end of the line rather than BLOCKS and Blocks away to walk toward the line. 

I stopped at the end of the line on the street to drop them off rather than pull off on a dark side street and let them out to walk.  I have done this every year of the event thus far without an issue.  

I was asking AITA because the traffic director told me I was.

There were No signs stating “no stopping” 

Even if I am The Asshole, I still think it was safer than dropping them a mile off.

90,1g7lst5,AITA for my 'tone' when speaking to my partner? ,"So my partner (M47) and I (F36) have been together for 16 months. Our relationship for the most part is great and I absolutely love him. However we have recurring rows because he believes I'm insinuating negative things about him. 

An example of this began last night when I went to empty our hoover and I noticed a crack at the end of the part that the bin slides on and off of. 
I said ""oh no!"" which my partner heard and asked about. I showed it to him, and as I walked back to get the bin container to reattach them I said ""we need to be careful with it"". He immediately said ""as I am with it"". 

Now, we both use the hoover so it's 50:50 which one of us broke it, and it's not even important. What is important is it's broken now so we both need to be conscious of it so it doesn't get worse. 

I got a bit upset and told him I wasn't accusing him of anything - only that we need to mindful about it, both of us, because we're a team, right? He told me it sounded to him like I was having a dig at him. I assured him I was not and he apologised. However it still didn't sit right. 

I went on to discuss that this happens more than I'd like, he can be so defensive or passive agressive without good reason. I reminded him of an incident that happened 2 days prior; he was working a shift that's difficult for him to get the bus in time for, so I woke up a half hour before he needed to leave to drive him in. We were just ready to go I just had one thing I needed to grab from inside. He was between me and the front door and he asked me for my keys (he was gonna start the car to get it warmed up). He then reaches for the front door and starts putting keys in. My stupid morning brain was confused (after just handing over my keys my brain automatically thought he's already locking up) and I said while reaching out to him ""no-no-no"". It was just a knee jerk response. But my partner turns to look at me and very slowly and enunciated ""I'm putting keys in the door for you to lock it"". I literally had to angle my head around him to look at the door and I see his keys in there. I said something along the lines of ""oh they're your keys"" and we both carried on. 
Thing is that incident also felt really off to me. I hate the way he spoke to me almost like I was stupid or nasty. And the uncomfortable eye contact.

So he started to elaborate on that incident and I was a little bit shocked to realise that it was 100% his intent to speak to me that way, and he was angry because I was implying he was ""stupid"" because of my ""tone"" when I said 'no no no'. This unfortunately escalated the argument and we started going back and forth. He is adamant that I had a shitty tone and I should be apologetic about it. I am feeling kinda alarmed at all of this. 

But could I have had a tone?? 
AITA and should I apologise? 
I honestly didn't mean to imply he was stupid. And while he can make mistakes, so can I, and I'm willing to try and learn if I'm doing something wrong here. 
",Not the A-hole,2024-10-19,"AITA for my 'tone' when speaking to my partner?  So my partner (M47) and I (F36) have been together for 16 months. Our relationship for the most part is great and I absolutely love him. However we have recurring rows because he believes I'm insinuating negative things about him. 

An example of this began last night when I went to empty our hoover and I noticed a crack at the end of the part that the bin slides on and off of. 
I said ""oh no!"" which my partner heard and asked about. I showed it to him, and as I walked back to get the bin container to reattach them I said ""we need to be careful with it"". He immediately said ""as I am with it"". 

Now, we both use the hoover so it's 50:50 which one of us broke it, and it's not even important. What is important is it's broken now so we both need to be conscious of it so it doesn't get worse. 

I got a bit upset and told him I wasn't accusing him of anything - only that we need to mindful about it, both of us, because we're a team, right? He told me it sounded to him like I was having a dig at him. I assured him I was not and he apologised. However it still didn't sit right. 

I went on to discuss that this happens more than I'd like, he can be so defensive or passive agressive without good reason. I reminded him of an incident that happened 2 days prior; he was working a shift that's difficult for him to get the bus in time for, so I woke up a half hour before he needed to leave to drive him in. We were just ready to go I just had one thing I needed to grab from inside. He was between me and the front door and he asked me for my keys (he was gonna start the car to get it warmed up). He then reaches for the front door and starts putting keys in. My stupid morning brain was confused (after just handing over my keys my brain automatically thought he's already locking up) and I said while reaching out to him ""no-no-no"". It was just a knee jerk response. But my partner turns to look at me and very slowly and enunciated ""I'm putting keys in the door for you to lock it"".

91,1g7lm1n,AITA For Moving Out of My Best Friend and I's Apartment and Asking Her BF to Pay My Half of The Rent?,"(This is my first time using reddit, so please bear with me. Just looking for opinions!)

In college, I, 20F moved into a small 2-bedroom, 1-bathroom apartment with my best friend, Avery, 20F. We split rent evenly and started off having a blast—going out, cooking, and enjoying each other's company. However, things changed when Avery began dating Sam. From the start, there were red flags: Sam lied about his age and school, and he wasn’t even a student or near our age. Despite my concerns, Avery didn’t care, and their relationship quickly became serious.

As time passed, I saw less of Avery. She spent most of her time at Sam’s and our friends would always ask what was up with her. When winter break came, we both decided to stay at our college apartment. Avery asked if Sam could stay for the weekend because he was getting evicted. I agreed, thinking it was a kind gesture. But that weekend turned into months. Sam never left, and I found myself uncomfortable with a grown man living in my space without contributing to rent or utilities.

With Avery often at work, Sam would just be at the apartments, making me feel super uncomfy. I avoided the living room and felt anxious about using the bathroom since it was right next to Avery's room. Sam would eat my groceries without asking. I tried talking to Avery about it, and while she apologized and replaced my food, the cycle continued. Eventually, I resorted to hiding my groceries in my room, but it felt unfair since I paid for half of the apartment.

Sam also brought his five younger siblings to our apartment without asking. They were unruly, broke things, and left a mess everywhere. I was overwhelmed, often locking myself in my room while they ran wild. When I confronted Avery about leaving them with me, she would apologize but never changed her behavior.

The situation spiraled into a depression that affected my college experience. After five months of this, I realized I couldn’t live like this anymore. I began searching for a one-bedroom apartment for peace of mind. I eventually moved out without telling Avery, as I was ready to escape the chaos.

I contacted my original apartment to break my lease early due to Avery allowing Sam to stay without my permission. They suggested I ask Avery to have Sam pay my half of the rent for the remaining two months.

When I called Avery to discuss it, she exploded, refusing to let Sam take over my lease. I tried explaining that I wouldn’t have had to leave if our living situation hadn’t changed. Avery countered that I hadn’t spoken up enough about my discomfort. Despite my previous attempts to voice my concerns, our friendship ended. In the end, I lost my best friend and a significant amount of money while feeling robbed of a part of my college experience.

92,1g7ljvj,AITAH for not attending a wedding for which I was the MOH,"So there’s a lot of history to this situation. I’ve been friends with this couple for about two years. Back in February when my then-best friend figured out she was going to be proposed to, she freaked out. She was graduating nursing school in May, she just turned 22 that month, and wanted to get settled in her career before getting married. I heard all this, and when they got engaged in March (which I helped arrange) and set a wedding date for September, I was skeptical. I’ll admit I was not super supportive at first based on how she told me she felt in February but after we talked, I dropped it. 

Since they got engaged, I never saw her. I literally have hung out with her probably twice since March. We had a conversation about it too and she basically said she would never come to me before her fiancée for anything and that he was her everything. Fine, whatever. I was still going to be her maid of honor. I had a really rough summer and was working 7 days/week, 50+ hours while being a full time doctoral student. Her sister in laws planned her bachelorette trip and I wasn’t able to afford to go (because they didn’t ask for budget ahead of time and only one other bridesmaid went). I was not involved with the wedding planning in any way, did not go to dress try on with her, and was (what I felt) actively excluded from any planning or prep. A lot of this I attribute to religious differences because I am not religious. 

I was not even told about a rehearsal dinner and had no details about the actual wedding.

I offered to help in anyway I could and when I texted the next day to check in, she told me they were getting married anyway with the immediate family that was already at the venue. Of course I was supportive of that decision. 

Then, I see the photos. The whole bridal party was there sans me and maybe one other person. I felt like it was a slap in the face. I could’ve attended if it was offered to me. I offered to help in any way I could, I felt like the only reason I was even told they were getting married that day is because I reached out. I get informed later that their reception is going to be on November 30th. I cannot attend because that is Thanksgiving weekend and my whole family lives out of state and they know that. I have not heard from her since I told her I could not go. 

I feel bad for not attending, but she has been such a bad friend for the last 6 months that I don’t even feel like either of us want me to be the MOH.

93,1g7ljv6,AITA for not giving an acquaintance money?,"I have this friend ""Mary"" from another state who came to my city recently and spent a few days at my place and some with other friends she knows here. While she was here she met with ""John"" who lived near my place and we hung out together during basically all her stay here. He was an intense person, very extroverted and the type to make every conversation about him and I barely had any alone time with my friend to catch up about stuff, but overall he is a nice guy. First day we met, I was taking them to this party and he asked to shower at my place, I don't remember why, but whatever. He came to my place every day since she arrived and hung out until late at night, and even asked to sleep here once. All this on weekdays. Now an important mention: I was (am) depressed and burning out, not in the right place to be having people over or partying. I am very low profile and barely had any social contact this year, but I made an obvious exception to hang out with my friend Mary. Another thing is John promptly brought cocaine everywhere and was constantly doing it. I don't judge but it's not my thing and the vibe it creates is really uncomfortable for me (imagine everything about him times a thousand).   
  
After Mary left, he would constantly text me (every day) and call me. First time he said it was pocket dial. He called my like 4 times after that, always at very inopportune hours. At this point I was ignoring his calls. Last was a few days ago when he called (from a different number so I didn't know it was him) 1am on a wednesday asking if he could stay at my place. He had a fight with his boyfriend and left home. Now, my life is in shambles right now. I was still working when he called me, trying to meet an insane deadline. I apologized but declined, told him to chill for a bit and go back home at least for the night. Yesterday Mary texted me saying he had lost his job, his boyfriend, was depressed and going back to his hometown as he was in need of help and didn't really have a net here. And then she said he had no money so he couldn't eat until he got to his hometown many hours later. I already knew where this was going and I was very busy at the time, so I said ""listen, I'd love to help him, but I'm waiting on payments so I can make my rent this month"", which is all true (I'm freelance). I had just spent money I don't have (on credit) on something I needed desperately to finish a work assignment. I am living month by month and have zero savings right now.

\[Mary's backstory \]  
  
Now, Mary got pregnant at 17 and her daughter is like 10 now. She has no job, no career, her folks help of course but she is constantly out of money. When she was here I paid for 70% of her meals, called Ubers for her, etc. She has asked me for money before, which I gave once or twice (nothing major, like a lunch). She sees me as someone with a ""nice"" apartment and a steady job, even though it's not all that great money-wise, I am able to maintain my apartment because I don't really spend any money other than food and bills and I barely go out, and I need my space to work. Mary is also very pretty and is used to having people drool over her, always having online creeps offering money for feet stuff and god knows what else. She does take some advantage of it (though I don't know the extent of how much). She sees me as a friend (and vice versa) but we have hooked up before. We don't flirt anymore. She sees me as the friend who ""has his life together"", because her social circle is pretty immature overall. I care for her and help her whenever I can, but she is also immature and irresponsible (not much has changed in her life since she got pregnant at 17).

Back to John's story. Mary was really pissed and said I have a cold heart. I declined giving him money because 1- he is not my friend, I met him a handful of times and he was sweet, but also really invasive and clingy. 2- I really am in a bad financial spot right now. Credit is also a thing, other friends, family, etc. 3- when I met him he was also constantly out of money (I paid for a couple of Uber rides, bar tabs, etc when we were hanging out), but he also always seemed to have money for cocaine. I knew this was not going to be the last time and would open this breach to treat me not only as 24/7 emotional support but also an ATM. I am depressed, with family problems, no social life and no money. I'm not in a place to be helping others, especially people I don't know very well. I realize I could've given him a few bucks and in the end I wouldn't die because of it, but am I really the only person in the world who can help otherwise he would go hungry for a day?

95,1g7l2nt,AITA for claiming to be disabled in front of my parents?,"I (20F) have a lot of health conditions. I’m diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder my dad also has, autoimmune disorders, etc, and am in tests for other things. My mom always believes I’m crying wolf, despite me being repeatedly proven right. 

I’ve worked in disability advocacy for years now, so many of my friends are disabled. A year ago, I confided in one of them that I sometimes feel as though I'm not disabled enough to use the label. He told me that while he understood my feelings, he'd seen how much my conditions affect my life. He pointed out that I don’t consider anyone else 'not disabled enough’, and that it's okay if I don't want to call myself that, but I shouldn't think of myself as exaggerating just because I don't yet need a mobility aid (he uses a walker). That conversation ended up giving me the confidence to start pushing my family to help me get tested, make appointments for myself, and admit to doctors the stuff I'd been downplaying or not telling them.

Fast forward to this summer: while on break, I was at a restaurant with my parents (my siblings were at camp). Near the end of the night, we were discussing something to do with my mom’s current project of increasing ADA compliance at work, and I said something along the lines of ""As a disabled person, I think-"" 

My mom was FURIOUS. She accused me of playing pretend at being disabled, making everything about me, and of exaggerating my ‘minor medical conditions’. My dad wasn't happy about it either, although more from the standpoint of his “you’re not disabled unless you let yourself be” mindset. 

The next day, I spoke privately with both of them.  I pointed out to my dad that our shared condition is legally a disability, that his mindset around disability is not healthy, and that I get to choose how I describe my body. He did some research, and ended up coming back to me to apologize about it. My mom felt bad for yelling, but kept insisting that I am not disabled and am essentially appropriating the word. When I tried to explain like with my dad, she told me in a patronizing way that I should do more research before talking to her about things like disability and ADA compliance (which I have studied in detail).

I know intellectually this isn't true, but it’s hard to actually believe it. Things have mostly been fine with my parents, but now whenever I mention disability around my mother in any context, I can tell she's clearly torn between her guilt at yelling at me and her anger at me for my 'appropriation'. 

TL;DR: I am disabled, but not necessarily in the traditional sense. When I mentioned this to my mother offhandedly, she yelled at me. Now I'm worried that I really am exaggerating or labeling myself with a term I don't deserve to use. Am I the asshole here?
",Not the A-hole,2024-10-19,"AITA for claiming to be disabled in front of my parents? I (20F) have a lot of health conditions. I’m diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder my dad also has, autoimmune disorders, etc, and am in tests for other things. My mom always believes I’m crying wolf, despite me being repeatedly proven right. 

I’ve worked in disability advocacy for years now, so many of my friends are disabled. A year ago, I confided in one of them that I sometimes feel as though I'm not disabled enough to use the label. He told me that while he understood my feelings, he'd seen how much my conditions affect my life. He pointed out that I don’t consider anyone else 'not disabled enough’, and that it's okay if I don't want to call myself that, but I shouldn't think of myself as exaggerating just because I don't yet need a mobility aid (he uses a walker). That conversation ended up giving me the confidence to start pushing my family to help me get tested, make appointments for myself, and admit to doctors the stuff I'd been downplaying or not telling them.

Fast forward to this summer: while on break, I was at a restaurant with my parents (my siblings were at camp). Near the end of the night, we were discussing something to do with my mom’s current project of increasing ADA compliance at work, and I said something along the lines of ""As a disabled person, I think-"" 

My mom was FURIOUS. She accused me of playing pretend at being disabled, making everything about me, and of exaggerating my ‘minor medical conditions’. My dad wasn't happy about it either, although more from the standpoint of his “you’re not disabled unless you let yourself be” mindset. 

The next day, I spoke privately with both of them.  I pointed out to my dad that our shared condition is legally a disability, that his mindset around disability is not healthy, and that I get to choose how I describe my body. He did some research, and ended up coming back to me to apologize about it. My mom felt bad for yelling, but kept insisting that I am not disabled and am essentially appropriating the word. When I tried to explain like with my dad, she told me in a patronizing way that I should do more research before talking to her about things like disability and ADA compliance (which I have studied in detail).

96,1g7l0c0,AITA if I don’t go to my husband’s family Thanksgiving?,"I’m a 23-year-old mother of two, and I’ve been married to my 25-year-old husband for four years. We found out we were expecting our daughter just a week before our wedding, and I became a mom at a young age. Throughout her early years, I was in college, which led to a lot of stress, and I often felt overwhelmed if things didn’t go according to plan. I had her on a strict schedule, and because of the anxiety it caused, I avoided traveling to family gatherings, even for the holidays.

My husband’s family is fairly close by, with his parents living 20 minutes away, his aunt 2.5 hours away, and the rest of the family scattered 4-6 hours away in another state. Last year, I worked hard in therapy to manage my anxiety and overstimulation, and I was proud to make progress. I even agreed to travel five hours for Thanksgiving, despite being seven weeks pregnant with our second child at the time.

Unfortunately, things took a turn when we got home. I developed a DVT in my leg and a pulmonary embolism. I was hospitalized with severe heart complications and was put on blood thinners, which I’ve been on since December. This past July, I gave birth to our son, and two weeks ago, I was diagnosed with a condition where my vein is compressed against my spine, meaning I’ll be on blood thinners for life. I’ve been advised to avoid sitting for more than an hour and to wear special compression garments that extend to my stomach.

Given these health issues, I told my husband’s parents well in advance that I couldn’t travel for the holidays this year, and they were understanding at the time. I even offered to host Thanksgiving at our home, which we moved into in March. My mother-in-law initially said she would check with the family, but now they’ve decided to hold Thanksgiving at his aunt’s house (the halfway point for everyone). Despite my earlier conversations, my MIL has told everyone we would probably attend, even though I made it clear I can’t travel.

My husband’s family is very close-knit, and they get upset when someone doesn’t attend family gatherings, which is quite different from my own family’s dynamic, where missing an event is no big deal. I even suggested that my husband could go without me and the kids, but it seems people are annoyed with my decision to stay home with our young children.

97,1g7ki0p,AITA for not letting my sister move in with me when she and her kids were facing homelessness?,"
Here’s a little bit of back story

In 2022, my sister (22F) had asked if she, her boyfriend (23M) and her newborn (6mo F) could stay with us for 1-3 months (which turned into 11 months) until they had gotten their taxes so they could save up and move to another place.

my partner and I agreed (21F & 20M) because it was only going to be a few months and I didn’t want them to be potentially homeless, with an infant. I had only 3 actual rules. A.) Take care of the wood floors B.) Help out with rent when they can C.) No births. 

My sister stayed home with the baby mostly, while us 3 worked through the day. But soon, so we’re consistently piles of dishes, dirty diapers, food trash, and just things left around.  And they had also spent all their tax money and asked if they could stay longer. 

After a while, my sister was getting really comfortable with asking me to watch my niece. I would end up watching my niece almost every night/off day for 1-5 hours. It got to the point where my partner and I couldn’t really hang out. Them living with us was starting to have an affect on mine and my partners relationship at that point. 

She had gotten prescribed birth control. Shortly after, I started to notice a bunch of ovulation tests in our bathroom. 

Not long after that appointment She happily came up to me and showed me a positive pregnancy test. She tried to lie and say that she was too fertile for birth control to work.m and said that it was accident. But it was so hard to believe. So then I told them both, they had to leave before that baby was born. 

When they moved out, Her boyfriend literally said to me before they left “wow your house looks TRASHED!” And then left. Their bedroom floors were super sticky, random substance on the walls, and a shit ton of dirty dishes were left For me to clean up. 

Now, it’s been about a year and a half since they left. And currently, my partner is having some heart issues causing him to be out of work and will need surgery. So I’m riding solo to keep a roof over our head, bills paid, and food in the fridge. 

My sister called me in a panic. Saying that her and her two babies that are now toddlers are going to be homeless because she was  on a waitlist for a rental assistance apartment And that she had done everything she could, and her boyfriend had been having issues keeping a job because he has a felony. And she had asked if she and my niece and nephew could stay with me for a few weeks. 

But I told her, no. I couldn’t take on anymore responsibilities than what I already have. That I’m having difficulty keeping up with my own shit. I suggested if they could reach out to her boyfriends parents, and see if they could help in any way. They agreed to let them stay. I called to check up on them, no response (which is very very unusual for her) and I feel like she may be upset with me, I just frankly have so much going on that I couldn’t go through that again.

99,1g7kaog,AITA for lashing out at my bestie? ,"I (19f) fear that I have a “good times only” relationship with my best friend (19f). 

I think we can all agree that being a young adult is really difficult in 2024. School is crazy, economy is crazy… you get the jist of it. I’m definitely feeling the anxiety of handling that truth. Point is, relationships are really important for people my age. The companionship helps cope with the stress.

Of course what I look for in a friend is someone I can lean on for support and guidance while I return the same supportive energy. I love my bestie to pieces, but I don’t believe she gives me the equal amount of support that I give her. Everyday I ask about what she did in school and her dating life in hopes that I will also be getting those questions back. Doesn’t really happen but I’ve given her grace. 

What’s kind of been triggering my frustrations about this particular situation is that right now I’ve really been struggling to find a part time job (which I understand many students are going through the same situation), I’m enrolled in some homework heavy classes, and I have a family member who has been in and out of the hospital which is the scariest thing for me. 

My best friend knows about all of this, but chooses not to check in or allow me to vent to her. I’m emotional, she’s not. I know this so I’ve let it slide but lately it’s been getting to me. 

So last night I was a mess. I received what felt like the millionth rejection letter from a dang retail job, I’m feeling stuck on a project, and of course my family’s situation. I contact my bestie crying. All I get back was “idk what to say but you’re okay and it’ll pass.” I reply that while she’s right, I’m not okay in the moment. Then she gives me another “idk” followed by “I was just caught off guard”. Frustrated I ask what does she mean and she responds with “Dunno just tired and not expecting it”

My mother was a painter/contractor, but lost contracts/jobs because she wouldn't show up because she was depressed or hung over. She has been a long time alcoholic, long before my step fathers passing. She hasn't been paying her bills and has been relying on other people pay for her. My step-father sister paid her $700 electric bill before we arrived because she didn't want my kids to go without power.

My aunt (my mother's sister) is the one who paid for our plane tickets to get here, with my mother promising her that she would  help us get settled and deal with the situation.

My  husband and I live in a different country than we were raised in. One of his sisters lives here with her husband.

We have had several miscarriages and are still suffering from infertility. SIL got pregnant right away.

SIL and I have never been particularly close. We’re friendly, and she worked for me briefly when she first got married. When she had been married about 3 months she came to me nervously to tell me she was pregnant, and that she knew that might be hard for me, given my situation. It was and I had to limit how much I saw her outside of work because I had a really hard time with the pregnancy, and knowing I would need to be involved with the baby when he came.

She had a successful home birth but baby later had complications that required him to be in PICU for 21 days. We came to visit once a week, which was the most we could manage with our schedule (I work 8-7 Sun-thurs, DH works 9-6). Most days I hardly have energy to eat at the end of the day. To top it off, I came home and sobbed for hours after every visit to the hospital, as I do in most situations involving small babies.Knowing that we weren’t able to come as much as they would like, we stayed in contact via text to see how they were doing.

SIL’s ILs came in, stayed in their house, say with baby in the hospital, and did some grocery shopping.Because we live in a non English speaking country MIL was having some difficulty shopping.I offered to be available by text and video chat to help identify items. SIL had a post partum doula cooking for her, so the groceries were not necessary to make sure they were fed.

SIL is still mad at me (almost a year later)for not coming to visit enough, not going with her MIL to the grocery store (I don’t go to the grocery store for my groceries), and not being around to visit more when baby was released from the hospital.

We have apologized that we weren’t able to support them in the way they needed, and explained some of what was going on behind the scenes for us. This has not improved the relationship, and she brings it up as proof that we don’t love her or the baby.

To top it off, I came home and sobbed for hours after every visit to the hospital, as I do in most situations involving small babies.Knowing that we weren’t able to come as much as they would like, we stayed in contact via text to see how they were doing.

SIL’s ILs came in, stayed in their house, say with baby in the hospital, and did some grocery shopping.Because we live in a non English speaking country MIL was having some difficulty shopping.I offered to be available by text and video chat to help identify items. SIL had a post partum doula cooking for her, so the groceries were not necessary to make sure they were fed.

SIL is still mad at me (almost a year later)for not coming to visit enough, not going with her MIL to the grocery store (I don’t go to the grocery store for my groceries), and not being around to visit more when baby was released from the hospital.

We have apologized that we weren’t able to support them in the way they needed, and explained some of what was going on behind the scenes for us. This has not improved the relationship, and she brings it up as proof that we don’t love her or the baby.

AITA?

102,1g7jefv,AITA for favoring my son over my daughter and now asking her to help him out?,"
I'm (50F) a mother of two, and I’m realizing now that I haven’t always been a great parent, especially to my daughter. My husband (55M) and I have a son (30M) and a daughter (28F). When they were growing up, I favored my son because, to be honest, he seemed like the one who would go far. He got great grades, won awards, and was always the ""promising"" child. My daughter, on the other hand, was more into writing and making weird little films with her friends. I didn’t understand it and, at the time, I didn’t think it would lead to a stable future, so we didn’t really support her creative passions.

When it came time for college, we paid for our son to go because we thought it was the best investment. We refused to pay for our daughter to attend film school, thinking it was a waste of money. I thought I was making the practical choice, but looking back, I realize how unfair I was. I didn’t take her dreams seriously, and I know I hurt her because of it.

Fast forward 10 years, and the situation is nothing like what I expected. Our son got kicked out of college for partying too much and hasn’t been able to hold down a job since. He’s still living with us and can’t afford to move out. Meanwhile, our daughter has become really successful. She’s a popular creator on YouTube, making original short horror films, with a huge following and solid income from sponsorships and other opportunities. I never saw that coming.

Now, my husband and I are struggling financially, and our son needs help getting back on his feet. We asked our daughter if she could help out by paying for an apartment for him, just to give him a chance to get on his own. She got really upset and refused. She told us that we always favored him and never supported her, which is true. She also said something that hit me hard—she believes if she helps her brother, he’ll just use the money to party and waste the opportunity, like he always has.

She doesn’t trust him to actually get his life together, and I understand why. He hasn’t shown much responsibility over the years, and I’m sure she feels like she’s being asked to bail him out while we never gave her the same kind of support.

I know I screwed up as a parent. I feel guilty about how I treated her growing up, but I also feel responsible for my son, who’s clearly struggling. I just want to help him get on track, but maybe asking my daughter was the wrong move.

103,1g7jcqs,AITAH for choosing to earn my own money as opposed to working for my mother?,"  Right out the gate I (20m) do not get along with my mother. Our relationship has gotten ever so slightly better since I turned 20 ( a few months back) but that’s not saying much. I would love to help my mother out with her business as I’d loved for it flourish but as of right now not only is it not profitable enough (I’ll comeback to this later) and I am also busy with school, my mother is too difficult of a person to deal with on a constant basis.

Back to my point of me not getting along with my mother. Since she started the business her relationship with “everyone” ( Who I REALLY mean is my father and I. Despite denying it, there is some clear favoritism for my brother) has gradually started to decay. What makes her so difficult to work with is her reluctancy to listen to tips from us that could help her and the business in the long haul, her inability to sit her feelings aside, and her just being a generally disorganized person. If you try to help things become more orderly, she thinks you’re taking the operation from her or being disobedient. Not to mention that she belittles basically everything I do to try and help.

This is beside the point though. I understand my mother just started her business and she is not going to be earning thousands in the beginning. My mother doesn’t earn enough from this truck and only makes just enough to pay the bills that she has and spends the little amount left on supplies for the business. Thus, she cannot afford to pay me nor my brother and it would be unfair of me to ask her for money when she can barely afford to stand on her own two feet. This is why Im applying for jobs. If I have my own money, I can support myself by paying for school and supplies for school (Art is very expensive) and the family if need be as it seems my father is struggling to pay for the house now.

Instead of trying to understand my point of view, she immediately goes into tirades about how disrespectful I am, how much like my father I am and how he is influencing me to get a job instead of working for her and earning nothing, and that she doesn’t want me to work with her when she eventually gets successful, she won’t help me if I do get a job or don’t get one. 

Regardless of what she says I have been and will continue to apply for jobs and set up interviews (just had one and will have another in a few days) no matter what she says or does to me.

104,1g7jals,WIBTA for telling my roommate to clean up after herself first before coming down on me for “not cleaning”?,"I (24F) am living in an on campus apartment with three other girls. I posted in the bad roommates sub about a month ago and got torn to shreds over not cleaning the bathroom. I have since gotten cleaning supplies and have been regularly cleaning our bathroom, while she has not at all in the month since I’ve bought them.

The biggest issue is my hair. I have long, thick hair that falls out a lot. I have no idea why so much does, but it happens constantly. I have done better with cleaning it up in the past month or so. Roommate (we’ll call her A) was harping on getting cleaning supplies. I went to Walmart and spent $60 ish on cleaning stuff. She never said thank you, and in the month that they’ve been in the bathroom under the sink (she knows they are there) she hasn’t cleaned. I have been cleaning, even at 11 pm after work because that was the only time I could find to do it. Another issue is that our shower curtain started getting moldy. This is not just in our bathroom, the other bathroom did too and the entire complex has a mold issue. She didn’t mention the mold to me and just started showering in the other bathroom. I found it for myself and went out and bought hooks, a new curtain and a new liner and set it up in our bathroom over fall break. She hasn’t said thank you or two words to me about it.

Today I went to use the bathroom to pee and she was in there. I went to use the other bathroom, and I guess she saw I was finally awake so she came to my room and told me my hair is under the toilet seat. I said ok and I’d clean it and she left. I haven’t noticed anything, but I’ll definitely look. But I can’t help but feel kinda pissed off. She doesn’t clean our bathroom to begin with, hasn’t thanked me for the money I’ve spent on things for our bathroom, and she leaves our floor soaked every day upon exiting the shower. She has also left hair all over our floor before too and I haven’t said a word. I guess I’m unsure of what she wants from me atp. I’m considering leaving a sticky note saying something to the effect of “if you’re going to get upset about me not cleaning or a strand of hair the least you can do is also clean up after yourself” but I feel like that would be bitchy.

105,1g7j5l3,AITA for trying to parent my best friend? ,"I'm going into this fully expecting to be voted as the asshole. I'm pretty sure I could summarize this on TIFU honestly. But I want to know what I can do about this. 
For Context, I (FtM18) have been friends with my best friend, ""Stella"" (F19) (name changed) since we were 2 and 3 years old. I've kind of grown up quickly due to some trauma etc etc gen Z trauma dumping here not the time or place to try and make excuses for why I am the way I am. 
Anyways, Stella has grown up with a lot of mental illness and hasn't been able to get a job on their own. She got a job through some of my references and we work together. 

Recently, that reference came to see us at home, and told me that she was worried that Stella relied too much on me and was co-dependent at work. People at work were gossiping about how little we get done together. I 100% see that, even though we divide tasks we often walk towards our goal together and we are very very often together. 

Where I might be the asshole is right here; When the work reference came to me, I turned that around to try and ""Teach"" Stella how to be better at work. They were coddled a lot by their parents and I want as a friend to be able to be that safe place but I feel like I have to take the role as ""the bad guy"" sometimes to try and help them be more of an adult because the world is really hard right now. What I said to her was that I wanted her to do work on her own and she got really defensive. I jumped into the convo with no warning saying that she cant use me or her mental illness as a crutch at work. We got into a fight and She was saying some things like ""i never asked you to coddle/parent me"" while I'm insisting that she needs to get her act together because my reputation at work was on the line. 
I felt like a huge dick for saying that at the end. We've made up and it's been a week and things are normal again, but I want to know if there's a way I can help her work better or just stay out of it and let her learn the hard way? 

EDIT: Since it's come up, and I don't want to seem like more of a dick than before, Stella is diagnosed as  a person with schizoeffective disorder. Sorry for just saying ""issues"" and making an ass of myself haha
Stella is quite literally the most beautiful person in my life and I would never want someone to see her like that, especially through my own lens. I apologize for that 💘
EDIT 2: I also wanna say that I also have ADHD and depression, and I apologized for this immediately after I realized I really fucked up here. I made this post a few days after the fight.

Hey, there is actually a LOT more backstory to this but with the character limit I won't be able to go into it all.
My older brother (M37 who i will call M) was always the preferred child with the family and although that hurt, I never hated him for it.
I, too, loved him and although we weren't as close as him and mom, I did believe we had a good relationship.
I (32F) was the ""troubled kid"" and didn't have a close bond with anyone.

About 6+ years ago M suddenly, without warning or reason, cut everyone out of his life.
I was the only one who managed to have some communication with him every now and then.
he never gave a reason as to why he went full NC with everyone else.
I didn't want to pressure him so I didn't push the matter.

Just after the nc thing, I was going through a very dangerous and traumatic year.
I had no one else to call for help at that time but he simply ignored me.
Even after initially seeing first hand how bad it was. (Police involvement bad)
When I finally had contact again with him more than a year later he never apologized or gave a reason, but at that time I was even more an insecure doormat than now, so i just let it go.

As a way of reclaiming a part of me that I lost in that year of hell, I decided to plan for a trip to Japan.
Which is a very big deal for me.
I wanted to share this important experience with M because I know he loves traveling and it would be a great bonding experience.
He was really into the idea and I thought everything went well.
Yet, getting in contact with him has still been very difficult and I've cried a lot over it.

Last month my gramps suddenly died.
It was unexpected and happened very fast.
He was having some problems so I took over a role of caregiver for the last 4, almost 5, years.
I am absolutely heartbroken over his passing as I've grown very close to gramps.
I had called M to let him know about what happened but, like always, I only got his voicemail so I had to leave it in a message there instead.
M never called back and didn't attend the funeral either.
Even though he was always very close to gramps before the NC thing.

That's when something snapped inside me.
I called M a few days ago and told him to call me before tomorrow night.
I just need him to call me so we can sit down and plan things for the Japan trip.
But if he doesn't I plan to chew him out for everything and tell him not to bother talking to me ever again.
I will plan the trip without him while letting him know exactly how I feel about everything.

When I ranted about it to a friend she told me that I am an a$$.
That M is probably feeling guilty and is grieving the loss of gramps, which is why he isn't talking to me.
I can't talk about it with family as anything around M is a sore spot.

110,1g7ifsl,AITA for asking my girlfriend to pay me $5 back for her food?,"I (31M) asked my gf(29F) for $5 the other night when I bought some fast food. We were out at an event that was fairly far away and were using my gas so when she said we should get some food, I had the expectation she could cover her portion. I put the food on my card and asked her to send me $5 when she got the chance, but she immediately started getting upset. Claiming $5 should not matter, it’s a drop in the bucket for your gf, other guys have never treated her like that, etc. 

I could maybe see her point, however I pay for a lot of things for her. I had treated her to a nice dinner earlier in the week, use my gas to drive us everywhere, had plans to take her out again this weekend, and usually put up 70% and greater cost for travel plans/ date nights. She also owes me thousands of dollars for helping put her through school. She has a job that makes good money, but she does not work 5 days per week by choice. I’ve brought it up before that I want us to be more fair with how we split costs, but she halfway agrees, but then gets upset when I ask for small costs even though I’m paying much more in the overall picture.

I feel she is very bad with her finances and she claimed she was struggling so me asking her for $5 was wrong. I do not expect her to go half on expensive stuff, but $5 for fast food I feel isn’t being petty. These kind of financial disputes occur pretty often for us.

I’m not sure how to approach it most of the time. I don’t want to have to ask her if she can split things fairly before every single thing we do, but I also kind of have to.

111,1g7ifqb,AITA for being this way with my mil for making me a baby shower ,"

Im 27F and fiancé is 37M, we recently found out we are pregnant 2 months ago. We recently shared to his family about the news. They were so excited, making my fiancé first child as well as mine. Being this is the second grandchild on his family side. His nephew is 11y so it’s been awhile. Compared to myself I have 9 nephew and nieces. All my siblings are girls so I’ve had babies in the family for awhile. Being said that, my mother always did my sisters baby showers and as we grew older we (sisters) did each other after mom moved away. But my mother and each other have always involved each other why because we’re girls and want everything to be perfect. Surprise at the end when it’s baby shower time. That is usually my experience with baby showers. 

My mother in law side apparently is totally the opposite. We haven’t even found out what the baby is and she is already planning the whole baby shower. Saying the dates and getting everything rearranged. (Side note) my mother in law not once included me into anything nor did she say if these dates were fine. Not only for me or my family. My mother in law LOVES to do her way or no way type of person and no one in her family ever likes to put her into her place. My fiancé is finally now after 5 years putting his foot down with her. But with me out of respect and not wanting tension I have never told her how I’ve felt about the matter. 

She has done a baby shower for her daughter years ago but her daughter doesn’t care of anything and lets her mom do whatever she wants. Well I’m not like that, I like to be involved into MY CHILD. It’s my baby shower and she should ask me what theme I want not what she wants. She also has more of the older generation type of baby shower. I’m sorry but I’m not wanting a 1980 baby shower. I don’t want anything home made from her. I’ve planned my sister baby shower and let me tell you it was beautiful!

We went to separate schools, but 2 years ago she introduced me to her school friends. While I am not a staple part of the group, I am often invited & friends with most.
I'm closest with Josh. Josh & Anna were best friends before they started dating several months after him & I had met. I supported them & grew closer with the group & him over the 6 months they dated. She broke up with him 9 months ago bc they didn't want the same things & decided to stay friends.
Due to the group & same school they didn't get any space. They both cared a lot & tried to make it work despite arguments. I offered them both the same support but he leaned on it a lot more than her, which lead to him & I becoming even closer. I talked to her after the break up about her feelings around mine & his friendship, she never expressed any issues with it. I was careful to never take sides in their arguments. We finished school a few months ago, shortly after their break up which put some more distance between them. They have grown apart and barely talk outside of group settings now but were still friendly.
I’ve occasionally brought my best friend Jane to events. Recently Josh, his best friend Liam and I have been hanging out. It's never planned, all spontaneous. It's normal in that friend group to do stuff in smaller constellations.
Josh and Jane now have a situationship (kissing, feelings but both plan to go abroad soon & don't want long distance).
Jane & Anna always got along, I think Anna considered her a friend but Jane's definition of friends is less broad. (girl code?) The whole group has a history of criss cross feelings and kissing (it's messy but somehow they all like each other).
Josh is my guy best friend & Jane is my ride or die, so this put me in a tight spot. J&J didn't really tell anyone, I found out on my own, as did Liam, and Josh told a girl from the group Lily. She told Anna. I told them to tell Anna before she finds out, but when I had only just found out, Anna asked me if there was anything going on. I lied and said no because I had not talked to Jane or Josh about it yet and I know Jane well enough to know she wouldn't want me to tell.
It blew up at a party 2 weeks ago, Jane was mad at Josh for telling Lily, Josh was mad at Lily for telling Anna, Anna is mad at me for lying to her.

115,1g7h5lv,AITA for pretending to like an artist that I actively hate to get close to a boy I like?,"This has been playing on my mind all week, so I thought I'd share it here.

I (19F), am a university student and take a class with a boy (19M). I've always found him kind of cute, and during one lecture he pulled out his laptop to take notes, which is when I noticed that there was a bunch of colorful stickers on the top panel of his laptop. Upon closer inspection they were a lot of BTS stickers, one of them was the 7 from their ""Map of the Soul: 7"" album cover, one was the BTS logo, and there were another 7 stickers that were the names of each member. All of that is to say, I was immediately certain that this boy was a BTS stan.

I on the other hand, am as far from a BTS stan as you can get. This is not my proudest confession, but I even used to be part of group chats where we would organize counter-voting, counter-streaming, and hate campaigns to bring them down because they would constantly get in the way of the artists I like on charts and award shows. I've moved past that now, we all had too much time in quarantine and I just chose to waste it on that, but still do bear some resentment for BTS and for their fandom, and do stay largely critical of them on my Twitter (X) account.

I would like you to think that I am a girl of principle, but for a cute boy, I was very ready to throw the BTS-hating part of me out the window. After the lecture, I approached him, and asked him if he liked BTS. In that moment, his eyes lit up in a way I had never seen them light up before, and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, if you spend a lot of time hating a group, you obtain as much knowledge about it as someone who's a fan of it, meaning we had a lot to talk about. Long story short, we exchanged numbers, and I asked him out to a date at a cafe. A couple dates later, he suddenly texts me that he thinks we should stop seeing each other.

I, kind of panicked, called him and he told me over the phone that one of his friends that knew one of my friends had tipped him off about my Twitter account, and he just couldn't handle the amount of ""red flags"" he saw.

A couple of days have passed now, and it's awkward if we bump in to each other now, but I still really do miss him. Pretty much all of our mutual friends are on his side, but I really do think it's childish that he broke off something that could've blossomed in to a great relationship just because I hate BTS. Am I the asshole here?",Asshole,2024-10-19,"AITA for pretending to like an artist that I actively hate to get close to a boy I like? This has been playing on my mind all week, so I thought I'd share it here.

I (19F), am a university student and take a class with a boy (19M). I've always found him kind of cute, and during one lecture he pulled out his laptop to take notes, which is when I noticed that there was a bunch of colorful stickers on the top panel of his laptop. Upon closer inspection they were a lot of BTS stickers, one of them was the 7 from their ""Map of the Soul: 7"" album cover, one was the BTS logo, and there were another 7 stickers that were the names of each member. All of that is to say, I was immediately certain that this boy was a BTS stan.

I on the other hand, am as far from a BTS stan as you can get. This is not my proudest confession, but I even used to be part of group chats where we would organize counter-voting, counter-streaming, and hate campaigns to bring them down because they would constantly get in the way of the artists I like on charts and award shows. I've moved past that now, we all had too much time in quarantine and I just chose to waste it on that, but still do bear some resentment for BTS and for their fandom, and do stay largely critical of them on my Twitter (X) account.

I would like you to think that I am a girl of principle, but for a cute boy, I was very ready to throw the BTS-hating part of me out the window. After the lecture, I approached him, and asked him if he liked BTS. In that moment, his eyes lit up in a way I had never seen them light up before, and we immediately hit it off. Turns out, if you spend a lot of time hating a group, you obtain as much knowledge about it as someone who's a fan of it, meaning we had a lot to talk about. Long story short, we exchanged numbers, and I asked him out to a date at a cafe. A couple dates later, he suddenly texts me that he thinks we should stop seeing each other.

I, kind of panicked, called him and he told me over the phone that one of his friends that knew one of my friends had tipped him off about my Twitter account, and he just couldn't handle the amount of ""red flags"" he saw.

116,1g7h4s4,AITA: I refused to let my (soon to be ex) roommate have a specific person over,"Long story short, my roommate (RM) is moving out slowly to move in with their partner.  Yay hooray congrats, I am genuinely happy for them. It's taking RM longer than expected to come get the last of their things like the bed and heavy boxes which RM says is just garbage and need to be taken out to the dumpsters, I just don't want to move any of the stuff without RM just in case some of it is not garbage. 

Anyway RM was supposed to come by today and move stuff with their partner, but let me know this morning that their partner was not available and the only other person was a mutual contact who I do not want anywhere near me. Let's call them AP (awful person). We were all coworkers, and this person AP was/is awful to me and continued to harass me at my new job. I have told RM before in no uncertain terms that I do not want this person in my apartment ever, to prevent AP from adding more fuel to whatever hate fire they already have towards me. My roommate said that AP was the only one available (""at no notice"" per RM, they've been mostly moved out for 3 weeks), and now is giving me the silent treatment over me saying that this was a hard boundary. 

A bit of context on timeline, RM gave notice at beginning of September, and has not paid for any of October rent. I have also been asking for over 2 weeks on when RM will move the rest of the stuff, so I can potentially get another roommate soon. I feel like I have been very generous that I'm letting RM store their stuff for this long for free, and basically let them do whatever while they lived here. This was my one and only hard boundary that I have made in the year+ that we've been living together, and that's not to let AP, my Bully, into my apartment. This isn't even a new rule, like RM has known this for 5+ months that I never want AP in my apartment. 

TLDR; roommate is moving out and her moving help is my workplace nightmare,  AITA for not allowing my ex roommate bring my bully into the apartment?

So I (43F) became a mother pretty early in my life. I knew that i didnt want to be just a mom, I wanted to be cool, and fun. my parents never gave me that experience, because i grew up in a stict, conservative household. When my daughter was born, we were extremely happy to have her in our life. She grew up pretty fast, and started to mature pretty early on. So when she was 13, she had a party in our house, without us knowing.

She rebelled extremely  aggressively, and quickly, and she did all kinds of unreasonable things, like sneaking out in a party, or have her boyfriend over( again we wouldve let her do most of these things, if she wouldve asked). so when she turned 18, she left our house, with a note on the dining table, saying. "" I left with xy (her boyfriend), Im fine, dont call me dont text me. I dont know when I'll be back, but dont freak out.

And then one day she knocks on our door, demanding ( not asking nicely or saying something comforting) we let her live hear again.

118,1g7h31n,WIBTA for not paying for the dumpster,"
I (29f) and my husband (30m) are currently living with his mom due to financial hardship that hit us during Covid. Recently, she bought us a new bed frame with storage underneath as an “early Christmas gift”. 

While we were in the process of changing the frames, we decided to overhaul our room and get rid of a ton to make it more space efficient for us and our two kids (5m and 1f). 

We kind of just threw the furniture in the backyard as our room has a door leading outside and it’s the easiest way to move stuff in an out. 

MIL said hubby and I should be responsible for paying for the dumpster removal. We were ok with that as it was mostly from us. And then everybody in the house (my hubby has 4 brothers ages 24, 21, 18, and 17. And one sister aged 14) would clean up the yard. She would pay for the poison ivy removal. 

Again, we were fine with paying the dumpster and decided to look around instead of going with the one my MIL always uses because it starts at $700 and charges extra for furniture, appliances, and anything that ends up being taller than the dumpster. As well as charges fees for the permits to discard this stuff. 

In looking around we decided we were going to get a quote from 1-800- gotjunk as their website says they don’t charge extra for the permits and they charge by volume not item. And if they were costly we had 2 other junkyards we were going to call for a quote. 

Well my mil decided she didn’t like this idea and went ahead and ordered the dumpster without even telling husband or myself. We don’t feel like that was fair and she’s basically trying to force us to pay $700+ that we don’t have (I’m not able to work due to disability and my husband gets maybe $1,200 in a good month as he works at a concession stand and $6-800 of it goes to mil for rent) we didn’t even know she ordered the dumpster until it showed up. 

When my hubby brought up that it wasn’t fair to do it without consulting us she said “well I bought your new bed so it’s the least you could do” (bed was $250 and we were planning on buying it whenever taxes rolled around) and “You live here for a low cost of rent. I should really raise it to cover all the bills” (were the only other adults the in the house that are pitching in and we are paying roughly a third to a half of the bills)

WIBTA if we said we no longer felt it fair for us to pay the complete total when she forced the cost on us? 


Tl;dr: we were getting quotes for dumpster removal and mil went behind our back and ordered one, expecting us to pay the $700+ bill. ",Everyone Sucks,2024-10-19,"WIBTA for not paying for the dumpster

120,1g7gwby,AITA for resenting my mom for abandoning me in the hospital? ,"To preface this, I have always struggled with mental health since about age 11. About a year ago, I (20F at the time) admitted myself to a behavioral health unit (AKA the psych ward) due to issues I was having. There were issues regarding my relationship as I was very codependent and suffered a miscarriage, so things were rough. 

I have a history of ideations, and this time, they were more intense, so after speaking to my therapist, she advised me to go to the hospital. 

I went without telling my mom (39F) because I didn’t want to be talked out of it, but I did call her once I was there. She was upset and went on about how I am so sensitive and dramatic, and there is nothing wrong with me, so why do I always go to those extremes? For context, we are black, and mental health is very stigmatized in our community. 

Once she kind of accepted my being there, we (me, her, and other family members) started to decide where I would go and who I would live with, as I wasn’t trusted to be alone (which rightfully so). I didn’t want to go live with her, and she got very angry with me, which is part of the reason I didn’t want to go - I was shamed for taking care of my mental health, and she was most of the cause of my issues. 

While there, I was diagnosed with a disorder that developed in cases of traumatic events such as abuse, neglect, constant distress, etc. So, in a way, I did blame her, but I felt she tried her best as a parent, so I reached out and apologized. 

In my apology, I essentially apologized for all of the stress I had caused her throughout my childhood and that it wasn’t her fault that I ended up the way I did (though I truly believed it was). She left my message on read and would not answer my calls, so I let it go. 

About two months later, after not talking to me at all, she reached out to me and asked me for a favor. I felt the apology wasn’t genuine, but I love my mom and wanted a relationship, so I helped her. 

Since then, our relationship has been okay, but I’ve realized I hold lots of resentment toward her, and I tolerate her rather than like her for the sake of my little sister. 

My dad believes I’m the AH because this happened almost a year ago, and I still harbor resentment towards her, and she was dealing with a lot of stress. I don’t believe that I’m the AH because I needed her the most at that time, and she abandoned me, which wasn’t the first time.
