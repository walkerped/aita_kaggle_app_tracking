1,1g7rm4s,AITA for not telling my friend the day that I got a new boyfriend?,"Alright this is an odd one.  Let's call the friend in question Zen.

So, I've known Zen for around 3 or 4 years, and she was a decent friend, but they tended to treat my other friend, Jae, like shit. That being said, Jae was quite friendly towards her, and he was part of my friend circle.
Me and Jae had feelings for each other and tried dating once during the first year, but quickly realized we weren't ready for that yet.

Zen mainly seemed to dislike Jae bc me and him bantered a lot, but none of it was super bad arguing, just little banter.

We grew a little bit apart, but we were still friends, just not as close. 

 And one day, Jae and I got back together. Now, due to the whole whirlwind of emotions, I didn't end up telling Zen for a couple weeks, and this is where I feel I may have been the asshole.

But when I told her, she threw a little bit of a fit. She was mad  I hadn't told her sooner, and kept treating it like Jae was some horrible monster. She kept complaining about how me and him ""fought"" and how he constantly misgendered me, etc.

(I hadn't come out to her as Genderfluid yet, but for a while, Jae had struggled when I thought I was transgender. It's been a journey, but Jae was doing his best to at least use they/them when referring to me. He was also brought up as a Methodist in an odd family, no offense intended, where he was raised thinking that sort of thing was wrong.)

She ended up saying that she would ""feel better"" if I had told her the day it happened, which wasn't an option at the time.
She also insulted him in dms when he tried to talk to her about it, and then directly called me some unpleasant things in his dms. 

He blocked her, and I cut her off, keeping one chat open in case there was an emergency with one of our mutuals. She forced one of our other friends, let's call him Dean, to get involved, but he told me he didn't wanna be involved and he would be leaving it be, so me and her could work it out however we saw fit.

Since then, she has tried to refriend me and ""work things out"" three times, not quite understanding no matter how I say it that I don't wanna be involved with her anymore.

We broke up and I'm with someone else now, but we ended on semi good terms and he never treated me badly.

2,1g7naon,AITA for hanging up on my mom," I'm (NB17) a college freshman that is going through a bout of stress in my first semester. My mom (56F) and I call/ft once or twice a week, but sometimes I do something that makes her upset. I feel very often that whenever I state my honest opinion about something that she immediately shuts me down or gets combative. She is also under a lot of stress, so I try to be sympathetic. Today, I called her to just talk in general (how her friends are, what work I'm doing for my classes, etc). She was talking about how one of her friends said that a movie I like was bad and an actress in it was a bad actress. I scoffed and said that that opinion was bullshit, trying to be funny, which made my mom a bit upset. We have very opposing senses of humor, and I try to make her laugh a lot, but it often falls flat. My mom then got even more upset at me when I realized I forgot which friend she was talking about (she has several friends of similar names). She then brought up the fact that I had apparently also come out to this person in order to jog my memory, which did not work. 

Now, this apparently happened all the way back when I was in middle school, and I had no recollection of it. I remember being very afraid to tell my mom I was queer/a lesbian at that time(I came out as nonbinary about 2 years later). My mom is still bitter about the fact that I told a lot of people I was queer before her, which I've tried to explain to her doesn't really matter because it's my information that I get to tell whoever I want, on principle. I don't remember a lot of middle school, or coming out (might've repressed it, idk, I also have a poor memory in general). 

I started panicking because she was getting upset with me for not remembering things. I started crying and bleeding from my nose (I get bloody noses when I'm stressed out, has happened since I was a child). I wasn't in good frame of mind and I honestly couldn't handle her looking at me, so I shakily hung up on her without saying goodbye or telling her I couldn't continue the call. 

She is very angry at me for doing this, even though I tried to explain that it was what I felt was best for me in that moment to handle the stress. When I am upset, I get very vicious and lash out, and I've gotten a lot better over the years at controlling myself, but I often avoid conflict when it's at a high point so that whoever I'm fighting/angry with and I can talk it out after we've assessed the situation a bit more. 

She is calling me disrespectful and bratty for hanging up on her abruptly. I don't feel its my responsibility to make her feel respected when I'm in obvious distress and panic mode. I know it was kind of a shitty move on my part to hang up, but she doesn't seem to understand or accept why I did what I did.

5,1g86bhh,AITA for choosing to celebrate my birthday with my mom and her boyfriend instead of my dad and his family?,"My parents divorced when I (15m) was 2. My mom's had a boyfriend since I was 6. Dad got married when I was 8. My dad has a stepson (11) and his birthday is 2 days before mine. So when dad first got married again he made us have a joint birthday party and made a huge deal out of my mom doing something as big or bigger. He said she should let him take care of those parties and she should celebrate with me alone. Instead of making it a fight she'd take me and my best friend to do something to celebrate. My half sister was born on my 10th birthday and she was added to the joint celebration at dad's. They made a very big deal about us being birthday twins and my dad's wife got on my ass about me not being happy about it. I HATED that she was born on my birthday and now had to share with both my stepbrother and half sister. She told me we're all siblings and I should love sharing with my little sister. She said I wouldn't be as upset if she was a full sister but that was *poop* and I should embrace having a sibling who shares my birthday and shouldn't make a big deal out of it because she's half.

I don't have fun celebrating with my dad's family. The parties are more for my half sister and stepbrother than me and really I feel like everyone makes a bigger deal out of us having the same birthday and birthdays so close together. We get so many photos taken together and dad's wife is always criticizing the fact I'm not hugging them or kissing them or holding my half sister or being silly and loving to them in the photos. She says I look so cold and like we're not actual siblings. I rolled my eyes at her one year and she told me it hurts the kids and not her so I should be better. Dad doesn't care about her saying this stuff.

I talked to mom about it and she agreed to throw me a party this year, like a real one. We invited all my friends over and she got a huge bounce house with a water slide attachment and she bought huge (and really huge) water guns and set it up where me and my friends could have a blast. She also set up the basement for a games night sleepover too. It was the best birthday I had in years. I always preferred celebrating with mom but she threw a party I enjoyed more and I liked that it was just about me. My friends had more fun too because we didn't have to watch out for little kids. We could go crazy on the bounce house and slide.

When dad found out about the party he got so mad. His wife was angry that I didn't save the experience to share with my stepbrother and half sister. My mom told dad to leave me out of it and she never should have tried to keep the peace for my sake by listening. He said parties should include my siblings. She said not when they're at her house and for me and friends. Dad told me he's disappointed I couldn't embrace sharing parties with my siblings and chose my mom to have my 15th party.

7,1g85ivo,AITA for embarrassing my friends by correcting my drink order?,"I (22F) don't drink for personal reasons, but I love the taste of pi√±a coladas. I recently went out to eat at Outback Steakhouse with two friends and saw ""pi√±a Koala"" on the menu. It was described as a cocktail version of a pi√±a colada with a koala on it. When the server came, I asked if they could possibly make a virgin pi√±a koala, and she said she'd ask the bar. A few minutes later, someone from the bar came over and said ""Here's a virgin version of the drink"" and put it on the table. It was¬†*not*¬†a Pi√±a Koala. This was a tall pink drink with a koala rubber duck on it (I later figured out this was their other ""Koala"" theme drink).

She had already left before I could process that I got the wrong drink. I looked at it again and said aloud to my friends ""This isn't a pi√±a colada..."" One of my friends responded with ""It's okay, at least you got a drink."" I shook my head and expressed that I ordered a pi√±a colada and that's what I was expecting. My other friend shook¬†*their*¬†head in response saying ""They went through the pain of making the drink virgin for you. Just be grateful.""

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-20,"AITA for embarrassing my friends by correcting my drink order? I (22F) don't drink for personal reasons, but I love the taste of pi√±a coladas. I recently went out to eat at Outback Steakhouse with two friends and saw ""pi√±a Koala"" on the menu. It was described as a cocktail version of a pi√±a colada with a koala on it. When the server came, I asked if they could possibly make a virgin pi√±a koala, and she said she'd ask the bar. A few minutes later, someone from the bar came over and said ""Here's a virgin version of the drink"" and put it on the table. It was¬†*not*¬†a Pi√±a Koala. This was a tall pink drink with a koala rubber duck on it (I later figured out this was their other ""Koala"" theme drink).

She had already left before I could process that I got the wrong drink. I looked at it again and said aloud to my friends ""This isn't a pi√±a colada..."" One of my friends responded with ""It's okay, at least you got a drink."" I shook my head and expressed that I ordered a pi√±a colada and that's what I was expecting.

8,1g85g6u,AITA for interrupting my sister when she tries to talk about me?,"My sister (30f) and I (26f) got into a fight a few weeks ago now. It started when tried setting me up with a guy she knew. I have been clear for years I do not want to date someone with kids, I do not want to be a stepmom or help raise/parent another person's children. That is not me. So guys with kids are not in my dating sphere. This guy my sister tried to set me up with has kids. She told him she would set us up but did not tell me. He was really interested and believed I was super cool with kids. She told me she would just have some friends there, which she did, but she didn't tell me about this guy and when I said he was cute she said he was single and had no kids so he was ""perfect"" for me. We chatted for a while and he was flirting and before we left he had said he was so glad I was open to dating someone with kids because people our age were usually not interested. I asked him what he meant and he said he had two kids and my sister had told him we'd be perfect together and I was ""super okay"" with being a stepmom. I explained it wasn't true. He was pissed at my sister and apologized for the misunderstanding. I told him I was sorry she had done that and I'd be talking to my sister.

She played innocent at first but she told me she did it because I broke up with the last guy I dated because he had kids and she found it sad. She told me I acted like it was a bad thing. I told her it wasn't a good thing for the kids I'd be ""stepmom"" to if I didn't want to be one and it was bad for them and me because he went on several dates with me before mentioning his kids. She told me I need to be open to dating guys with kids and I shouldn't say no to being a stepmom. Then she made it personal and said it's why she's still single because nobody wants a single mom. I told her plenty of people are open to it but those of us who aren't shouldn't be forced because it won't be good for anyone, least of all the children.

She was mad at me for not backing down and in the weeks since she has ranted about it and taken digs at me over this. So I have started interrupting her when she brings me up in conversation. She told me I can shit all over her feelings but I can't silence her. I told her she's going way too far with this. She claimed I'm showing how much of a heartless person I am. She also said I'm rude for interrupting her like I do.

9,1g85bw9,AITA for heating up some noodles instead of eating my mom's food because she threw away my takeout?,"So I (23 F) got some egg fried rice takeout on Friday night, and I had it in the fridge till Sunday. I excitedly told my mom (51 F) I was gonna heat it up, and she flipped. She took the takeout from my hands and said it was bad and threw it out. If she had told me to save it for dinner and eat her lunch, I would've been ok and honestly would've forgotten about having takeout by then. So I got some noodles, heated it up and said her food's worse than the noodles.

Now Im gonna be blunt, I dont like 80% of the food my mom cooks, and she isn't a fan of being in the kitchen. She knows she's not the best chef. I eat things out of respect for putting in the effort and time, not out of taste. I've suggested some easy to cook foods that are tasty, but she doesn't take those suggestions. She cooks what she likes, and I get that the chef should have first choice, but our taste buds are opposites. She's picky af and hates everything I like tbh.

Before you say, OP you're 23 and living at home, just go get your own place and eat what you want. I'm not in the position to do this, still finishing college, and we get along like 90% of the time. To be fair, she's menopausal and going through some mood swings, so I try my best to respect this too, as it's already hard enough for her.

But I am a foodie. I like to eat what tastes the best. I am not picky and love to experiment different cultures foods. I also don't waste my food, which she's really bad about. She'll throw out meals for the smallest issues or just because its more than a day old. I remember our days of being poor and only having the luxury of smelling good foods walking by. Or on field trips, wouldn't eat at places/just drink water. Or during MS when my bully kept taking my lunch money, so I'd skip meals and sit in the bathroom.

I live by ""I'm here for a good time, idgaf if it's a long time or not."" Every Friday, we eat together as a family, my mom, dad and me. Today she told me she doesn't even like those times of eating out and that that food sucks. I started the Friday tradition and pick up the tab, and randomly during the week she'll ask me to order takeout for her, and I do. Idgaf about that. But it's kinda flipping the switch to ask me to order takeout and then say it sucks.

Him and a few friends where coming over immediately after school with the rest coming later, which works out handy enough as it was a non uniform day for a fundraiser and they left early as they had a workshop after lunch, might get in bother for it but they didn‚Äôt miss a class or anything so no one can get too mad. 

So yeah they arrived at like half 1, he‚Äôs 16 so obviously allowed to drink, but not too long ago there was a bit of an episode where he was drinking with friends then came home very upset and was sick so our mum told me to  keep an eye just, speak to him if I have to because she was away and wouldn‚Äôt be back until the evening. So not to over do it but just pop into the kitchen a couple times see how they‚Äôre doing. 

So him and 3 friends of his are in the kitchen and have just started drinking, I ask my brother seeing as they left just as lunch starts did he get food/when‚Äôs the last time he ate and he said he hasn‚Äôt eaten since breakfast at like 7. 

I ask if he wants I‚Äôll head to the shops they should still be doing hot food if he wants lunch. He said it‚Äôs alright he‚Äôll be getting a big feed later on and he‚Äôs not too hungry. I mention in a friendly way, I wasn‚Äôt being patronising or anything, wouldn‚Äôt he be safer lining his stomach a bit before he properly starts. He again said no.

12,1g84afi,AITA for not getting rid of my cats for my pregnant best friend,"Edit: thank you everyone for the suggestions and educational info. I did my best research as soon as I found out Kristy was pregnant and it was a relief to see so many comments concurring. Secondly, I do thankfully have cameras in mostly all spaces in my home, including front and back entrances. I truly don‚Äôt believe Kristy herself would ever harm or put my cat in danger, but I know crazier things have happened so‚Ä¶ 
Last, Kristy is staying at her bfs tonight and we haven‚Äôt spoken much on the situation. In the little talk we had after her mom left, she was deeply apologetic and did tell me she doesn‚Äôt mind the cat(s) at all and doesn‚Äôt feel unsafe. I will be talking to her again tomorrow night about not allowing her mom here given the way she spoke to me and about my animals, and coming up with a more airtight agreement in writing of her living situation here. 

Throwaway account. I 22F have lived alone since the beginning of this year in a 2b 2bath condo. I have one cat who is my pet, but I also volunteer with a local cat rescue organization. It‚Äôs fairly often that I temporarily foster cats/kittens anywhere from just 1 night-2 weeks at most, until we clear them to be placed in our shelter, or with another foster, or they are adopted. Usually I take in 1 foster at a time, but at times it‚Äôs 2 if they‚Äôre siblings, bonded, etc. 

Recently this summer, my best friend ‚ÄòKristy‚Äô 23F moved in with me because she was on very bad/hostile terms with her mom and stepdad who she lived with, and it was safer for her to move out. I of course offered her to stay with me, and shes been in the spare bedroom since. However last month, Kristy found out she‚Äôs pregnant from her bf. They have a plan to get their own place asap she says, but I truly don‚Äôt mind if she stays here as long as she needs. 

Given that she‚Äôs pregnant, when she told her mom last week, her mom wanted to come over and talk things over. So she came here on Thursday and they talked privately for about 2 hours. When they came out it seemed like it was a good chat and they were more relaxed. But, her mom kinda turned her attention towards me and said ‚Äúif Kristy‚Äôs going to be living here, you need to do something about the cats.‚Äù I asked what she meant, and she mentioned toxoplasmosis, the litter boxes, number of cats here, etc. and started getting an attitude towards me and said ‚Äúyou guys should‚Äôve thought of this already.‚Äù 

I let her know we did actually; and there‚Äôs an extremely low to no risk of toxoplasmosis. I only have one cat (my own) in the main house, who doesn‚Äôt go into Kristy‚Äôs room. Kristy also has 0 obligations or responsibilities for my cats, I let her know that the minute she moved in. All litter boxes are cleaned minimum twice daily, and aren‚Äôt even anywhere near Kristy. My cats litter box is kept in the garage (she has a cat door) and any foster cats I have are kept in my master bathroom. It‚Äôs a large bathroom and adapted to be safe for a temporary foster. The only interaction Kristy has is if she happens to be in the living room/hallway/kitchen with my cat at the same time, so contact is extremely limited. I also want to add, all cats I foster are up to date with vaccines, spayed/neutered, and exclusively indoor cats only.

After explaining all this to Kristy‚Äôs mom, I told her that at most I would be willing to possibly limit the fosters I bring in, but I will absolutely not be getting rid of my cat. She told me ‚Äúwell yours is the biggest risk here.‚Äù ALSO she tried to suggest that I should stop volunteering with cats altogether until Kristy moved out or until the baby is born. Kristy tried interrupting her mom to calm down because she kept going on about how I‚Äôm being selfish, I‚Äôm not realizing that she‚Äôs carrying another life now, not considering the risks, etc. but given their relationship, she was very on edge with her mom which I understand. 

I love my best friend, but I will not be getting rid of my pet in my own home that was here before she was.

13,1g844ri,AITA for contacting a friend from his past about his concerning behaviour?,"I, (33 F) and my ex (36 M) were friends for a few months before becoming a couple. 

During our friendship he opened up about his previous relationship, that she stalked him, called him from withheld numbers at all hours of the night and how he had fallen out with his close female friend due to questionable behaviour. We were a great couple, we really got on, introduced him to my friends and took him back home to meet my family.

3 months in - he became very insecure, started with my colleagues at work, he mentioned what would happen if one of them took a shine to me, and I said that doesn't matter because I'm not interested in anyone but you, he continued to mention colleagues. He questioned me taking my phone into the bathroom, to which I said, I scroll my phone when I'm in there and listen to music when in the shower. I offered him the opportunity multiple times to go through my phone if it would help him to feel more secure, as I had nothing to hide.

This became more common, he'd argue with me frequently cause me of cheating, I started apologising for being on my phone, which he said made it look like I had something to hide. He'd get angry when I didn't reply to a text straight away. If I woke up and didn't text him straight away but had been online, he would question why I waited 20 minutes to message him. Everyday arguments, him screaming down the phone first thing in the morning, he'd call multiple times when I was at work, then argue on the way home. I asked for some space, he tried to call I said I really didn't want to speak to him tonight after the morning argument, he rang me 18 times on my way home.  He followed me home in his car, and shouted we're done through the window when I didn‚Äôt stop.

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-20,"AITA for contacting a friend from his past about his concerning behaviour? I, (33 F) and my ex (36 M) were friends for a few months before becoming a couple. 

During our friendship he opened up about his previous relationship, that she stalked him, called him from withheld numbers at all hours of the night and how he had fallen out with his close female friend due to questionable behaviour. We were a great couple, we really got on, introduced him to my friends and took him back home to meet my family.

3 months in - he became very insecure, started with my colleagues at work, he mentioned what would happen if one of them took a shine to me, and I said that doesn't matter because I'm not interested in anyone but you, he continued to mention colleagues. He questioned me taking my phone into the bathroom, to which I said, I scroll my phone when I'm in there and listen to music when in the shower. I offered him the opportunity multiple times to go through my phone if it would help him to feel more secure, as I had nothing to hide.

This became more common, he'd argue with me frequently cause me of cheating, I started apologising for being on my phone, which he said made it look like I had something to hide. He'd get angry when I didn't reply to a text straight away. If I woke up and didn't text him straight away but had been online, he would question why I waited 20 minutes to message him. Everyday arguments, him screaming down the phone first thing in the morning, he'd call multiple times when I was at work, then argue on the way home. I asked for some space, he tried to call I said I really didn't want to speak to him tonight after the morning argument, he rang me 18 times on my way home.  He followed me home in his car, and shouted we're done through the window when I didn‚Äôt stop.

A few weeks ago I house sat while sister and niece went on a trip, my sister paid me for that. When they got back I asked her why she will pay me to watch her dog but not her kid. Her response was, ""You're her aunt, it's just what family does.""

Edit: I love all of my nieces and nephews and am willing to babysit for a few hours for free. I am the ""fun"" aunt according to them. I just feel that caring for a child that is not mine and has a disability for days on end should be compensated a bit.

I finished Summa Cum Laude from a top uni. I attribute a lot of my success to my parents as they were supportive and helped me out in achieving my academic and job goals. They even lessened my house chores just so I would have more time to study/rest. 
I finally got my 1st pay after 2 weeks of work. The norm for people in our country (not sure abt cultural differences) is for children to treat their family to a nice meal upon getting their first pay. But my dad suggested that I do something different: I should withdraw my whole 1st salary and give it to my mom. I liked his idea and thought of it as a very noble gesture. We are financially stable, so the giving of my first salary was no problem to me and I was 100% game. (I gave it to my mom because she is the accountant of our family, under the notion that she will share the money with the whole fam if anyone wants something, which she was willing to do).

My mom was very pleased & almost cried at dinner since she was so touched. I got praised by my sister and father for my actions. I felt internally happy because I was able to give my 1st salary and do something different.

Next day, mom went home after buying designer shoes that were almost 2x the amount I gave her. It‚Äôs eventually revealed that she used her own money for it and not my pay, but I was happy for her since I wanted anyone in the family to be able to use it for something they really wanted. I complimented her and laughed: ‚Äúwow, i didn‚Äôt know my first salary would be able to pay for something as expensive as that! hahaha!‚Äù 

my mom replies in a semi-joking manner: ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt you say you would give me your whole month‚Äôs salary and not just 1/2? hahaha‚Äù

she said she was joking but ever since then i feel so bad and as if my gesture was negated. all of a sudden i don‚Äôt even want to use my 2nd salary for the month to buy anything for myself but to spitefully and painstakingly just give it to her even though it will secretly leave me in tears. I got hurt on the onset and said that what she said hurt me, but she replied that she was just joking.

In recent days, I got fever & waited almost 6 hours for them to come home and pick me up for an event i had at night & give me my meds.

So I‚Äôm a 21-year-old college film student, and for my latest project, I made a short comedy film.

It wasn‚Äôt meant to be a big deal‚Äîjust a quick shot of him waking up and getting out of bed. I thought it was realistic and fit the tone of the film.

Before we filmed, I talked it through with the actor, and he seemed fine with it. He even joked about how everyone sleeps in their underwear anyway, so it wasn‚Äôt a big deal. The shoot went smoothly, and there were no complaints at the time.

But now, a few days later, he‚Äôs telling me he feels weird about it. He says he‚Äôs uncomfortable seeing himself in his boxer briefs on screen and that the scene wasn‚Äôt really necessary. He‚Äôs not mad, but he wishes I had come up with another way to show the scene without him being in his underwear. A couple of our classmates have sided with him, saying maybe I should‚Äôve done something different.

The problem is, it‚Äôs too late to change anything. The project‚Äôs already been edited, submitted, and shown in class, so I can‚Äôt go back and cut the scene. I feel bad because I didn‚Äôt want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I also thought we were both fine with it when we filmed.

18,1g83mvh,AITA for bringing up the fact people brought up concerns about my brother's daughter when he remarried?,"My brother lost his first wife when their daughter Thea (19f) was 6. Before the death of his first wife they also had a stillborn daughter together. This was 2 years before my brother's late wife passed away. So they went through a lot and my brother struggled with both losses happening so fast. But Thea was really close to her mom and had a hard time with not having her around. When my brother met his current wife, Denise, Thea was 7. They got married when Thea was 9.

I, along with my parents, had mentioned to my brother that Thea didn't look happy with the upcoming wedding and his relationship with Denise. She wasn't being mean or acting out but we could see she kept an emotional distance from Denise and her smiles looked forced. Of course she had lost her mom so it made sense but we figured my brother should know and could probably help her but he said she wasn't saying anything and therefore was fine.

Every photo Thea was in at the wedding she had a very fake smile and there was no joy or happiness in it. She was going through the motions. It was the same when her first half sibling was born 5 months later. She never held her. But any photos with them she did not have a happy smile. And she was not an adoring big sister like others described her as. Any photos with her half siblings and Denise she looks downright uncomfortable and the smile is so strained. My parents and I had mentioned this to my brother a couple of times each after he remarried. But again, because Thea said nothing it was considered fine.

The only time he took it anyway seriously is when a relative visited two-ish years ago. He saw some photos from my brother's second wedding and mentioned how clear it was Thea was faking her smile. My brother was sort of like wtf. This relative would not know Thea well but still picked up on it. Dense told me that same day that Thea never let her in and she didn't think Thea cared much for her and the kids.

Now that Thea's a college student she's living on her own and she has put some distance between herself and them. My brother wanted her to come for a 10th wedding anniversary family dinner and she told him she had no interest in celebrating his second wedding, which shocked him. She also told him she was spending Christmas with her friends this year. But then he learned she was planning to stop by to see our parents for at least one day. He confided in me about this and how upset he is that she's got these feelings and how much of a shock it was. He also said Denise told him she doesn't believe Thea loves her or the kids at all. And this might make me TA but I brought up the fact our parents and I had told him a few times already and he brushed us off. He told me I was great at being supportive and thanks for nothing. There's been a chill between us since then.

Here comes the problem- for years when we have ordered food, he has neglected to realize that the food we order is for the whole family, not just him. My husband and I have both spoken to him about this multiple times and usually he just gives half-hearted apologies. We are working on this with his therapist, among other issues he has.

On Friday, my daughter had work after school so she drove herself there while my son took the bus home. He said he was hungry so I ordered a pizza and told him to save some for his father and sister. I only took a slice. Usually my daughter does not eat much (1-2 slices) and same thing with my husband. That would've left him with 5 slices of a LARGE pizza. About 2 hours later, my daughter comes home and sees the pizza box empty and starts balling. She usually is not one to complain about food and will usually just make her own food but she did not have time to eat before work today and during lunch she was making up a test, so she did not eat since breakfast.

I was furious at my son and deducted the money for a new pizza plus a generous tip to the delivery driver from my son's bank account. My son saw and now he is pissed. My daughter thought it was the right thing to do, especially when this is about the 3rd time it had happened to her. My son's reasoning is that he doesn't work so his only sources of income are for his birthday and Christmas, so my daughter should've paid since she has a job. My husband and I both are on board with what I did, but idk, is my son right? AITA?

  
**\*UPDATE: For everyone saying we are underfeeding him, we have tons of food in the house. The fridge is stocked, we have snacks, ingredients etc. My son refuses to learn how to cook, even when we have offered him cooking classes. Even without learning to cook, we have boxed pasta, popcorn, bread, vegetables and fruits, rice etc. all of which require no cooking ability.

So, my (25M) scene partner (also 25M) and I have been friends since college, but we recently started doing improv together. We‚Äôve always had a pretty chill dynamic, teasing each other a lot and not really getting embarrassed about stuff easily. Last weekend, we had our first improv show, and I think I might‚Äôve messed up.

During the show, we ended up in a scene where we were at the beach. At one point, my partner, in character, tells me to take his pants off because we were ""going swimming."" Now, in improv, you're supposed to go with the flow, right? So, I figured I‚Äôd commit to the bit for a good laugh and actually pulled his pants down. I thought it was fine because we‚Äôve joked about this kind of stuff before, and he never seemed like the kind of guy to get embarrassed easily. Plus, the audience totally cracked up, so I thought it was a hit.

But after the show, he was pissed. Apparently, when he said ‚Äútake your pants off,‚Äù he meant mime it, not actually do it. I apologized right away, but he told me it was super embarrassing and unprofessional. Now he‚Äôs mad at me, and I feel like an idiot for not realizing what he meant. I thought we were on the same page, and since we‚Äôre close friends, I didn‚Äôt think it‚Äôd be a big deal.

I feel bad, but at the same time, I thought we were supposed to go with whatever happens in improv. I didn‚Äôt mean to embarrass him‚Äîjust trying to keep the scene fun and unexpected. AITA for not catching on that he didn‚Äôt actually mean for me to pull his pants down?

D is Christian and comes from a very religious family. A is Christian too but isn't as religious(?) (Sorry if this sounds insulting/weird?). A and I are atheists. For the most part we don't really bother each other about religion, nor are we pushy about what we believe in except for that D isn't the biggest fan of queer people (she doesn't outright insult them but isn't accepting either, she claims she's neutral). 

Recently I drew a character with religious trauma. We usually draw 2 pages when it's our turn and decorate it with washitape, stick on decorative things, etc. I usually really like adding things the characters have said/fit the character, so on the 2 pages I drew, 2 quotes/things were written: 

""God loves you, but not enough to save you""

""I need a father. 
I need a mother. 
I need some older wiser being to cry to
I talk to God, but the sky is empty.""

D got really angry at me when she saw that, saying that it was extremely disrespectful and that she was disgusted with me. A says that she can see where D is coming from, and S says that she doesn't think she can give her opinion because she isn't religious. 

D has since sent me an angry paragraph about how rude I was and some other stuff about Christianity. Aside from that she has been ignoring my apologies and requests to talk about it but still talks to A and S.

They then asked her if she had any teaching experience and she said she did not. They then spent the next 30 min naming a bunch of masters programs she should apply to instead, but my friend already has a masters in math and feels ready to take on a PhD. They also mentioned a few people in the community she should reach out to about their experiences, offered her the option to stop by their offices if she ever needed anything, and then wished her luck before signing off. They then rejected her from the program, despite her excellent grades and GRE scores. 

She was in complete tears when I saw her afterward and basically said they never gave her a chance to explain herself or her background.

We are all around the same age and it's coed We had arrived at the park around 1 and by the time it was 5 PM we had only went of 3 rides. Wanting to still go on more, we all decided to go on Flight Deck, a popular ride that makes riders go upside down with their legs in the air.

After the ride, while we were still on the roller coaster one of my friends (F), saw my other friend who had their head down and was unresponsive. In panic, she told my friend next to her (F) and she started to check her pulse. At this moment, me and my 2 guy friends were in the front still screaming in shock of the ride. My guy friend next to me, clueless on what was happened screamed ""HAWK TUAH!"" but then we all turned back to see my friend passed out. ""SHES PASSED OUT SHES PASSED OUT"" my friend screamed, her face filled with tears. (We were sitting right in front of them but it was hard to see). We started to scream my friends name and ask if she was okay but to no avail did she awake. One key fact to know is that she has passed out before, and tends to regain consciousness after 30 seconds. Knowing she passed out likely before there ride ended, I slipped out a joke, ""Hey look, your crush is over there!"" My guy friend (who didn't say anything atp) giggled. The friend who was passed out was really interested in this one guy, and thinking she was awake again, I said that to motivate her. I never meant any harm to her, and I just tried to lighten the mood after she awoken, but to my horror, she didn't respond. After a couple more seconds she reawaken, looking all confused and worried why we were all screaming her name.

She had tried talking to my passed out friend making sure she was okay but I never heard her. The lady looked at me and said ""WHAT ARE YOU DOING, JOKING ABOUT YOUR FRIEND! NO MORE HAWK TUAHS, NO MORE FIENS, YOIR FRIEND IS PASSED OUT AND YOUR LAUGHING?"" Being deathly afraid of talking to adults I froze and didn't say anything. After, she proceeded to lecture me and all my friends (some of them who hadn't even said anything) about morals and how we were bad friends. The ride now had gotten back and she continued to lecture us. She checked up on my passed out friend and told her to find new friends because we were all ""careless"".

37,1g81hjr,AITA For Taking My Bio Mom's Kids Away From Her?,"I (19F) am a very no-nonsense kind of person. I don't put up with other people's bullshit and I have a low tolerance for disrespect- regardless if it's directed towards me or someone I care about. The reason for this is is because when I was younger I grew up as a serious people pleaser to the point where I suffered a LOT and had a severe ED. 

I was adopted at the age of 13 by a family in Alaska. I went to boarding school in my senior year of high school and I decided that instead of flying back to Kenai where my family lived, I'd fly out to see my bio mom in the lower 48. I didn't get along with my adopted mom back then to the point that I dreaded going back even for just a week. I was extremely depressed and you know what they say- the grass is always greener on the other side. We‚Äôve managed to work out our issues now and are on relatively good terms now.

When I came down to see my bio mom, I was expecting her, her boyfriend and my five half-siblings. However, she failed to mention that her and her boyfriend weren't together AND my 3 half-siblings (ages 6,8 and 14) had been taken away from her for a while. Two months into my stay and she got news she had lost all contact.

I was already a little sketched out, but I did genuinely want to try and have a relationship with my bio mom since I never had a mom figure in my life- last time I had seen her I was like 5.

Then, she got arrested. For what, I still have no idea since she never told me. Likely wasn‚Äôt too serious since she was released the next day, but it surprised me.

Another three months later, she got arrested AGAIN. So I got a flight back to Alaska and made a report to CPS on the day of my flight.

Long story short, CPS did come since I said there MAY have been use of meth (never found actual evidence, but there was a whole basket of freaking medicine bottles filled with different pills) and they took the twins away since she had lost custody of her first 4 children (including me).

I don't put up with other people's bullshit and I have a low tolerance for disrespect- regardless if it's directed towards me or someone I care about. The reason for this is is because when I was younger I grew up as a serious people pleaser to the point where I suffered a LOT and had a severe ED. 

I was adopted at the age of 13 by a family in Alaska. I went to boarding school in my senior year of high school and I decided that instead of flying back to Kenai where my family lived, I'd fly out to see my bio mom in the lower 48. I didn't get along with my adopted mom back then to the point that I dreaded going back even for just a week. I was extremely depressed and you know what they say- the grass is always greener on the other side. We‚Äôve managed to work out our issues now and are on relatively good terms now.

When I came down to see my bio mom, I was expecting her, her boyfriend and my five half-siblings. However, she failed to mention that her and her boyfriend weren't together AND my 3 half-siblings (ages 6,8 and 14) had been taken away from her for a while. Two months into my stay and she got news she had lost all contact.

I was already a little sketched out, but I did genuinely want to try and have a relationship with my bio mom since I never had a mom figure in my life- last time I had seen her I was like 5.

39,1g80vmy,AITA for not helping out around the house more?,"I (F20) live with my younger sister (F12) with our parents.

Around two weeks ago, my mother had a small accident - she didn't notice a doorstep and fell on both of her knees. She's already had some health conditions related to her knees, had a knee surgery half a year ago and went to rehab twice after that. That's why the accident was an extreme bad luck for her as she damaged her knees even more. Now, she's walking around the house with the help of crutches, can't go out for the time being and can't bend one of her knees or stand on the leg.

That's why me, my younger sister and our dad need to help out around the house more because my mom isn't able to do much at the moment. She can't walk while holding any objects as she needs to hold the crutches and doing anything, like cooking, is more difficult for her now.

I'm happy to help and truth be told, I've really been doing a lot this past week. I was going shopping nearly every day (before the accident, it was something my mother would do and sometimes I would help out too, but it wasn't often), I was bringing my mom any objects she would ask for - coffee she made herself in the kitchen, foods, medicines, water bottles, literally anything, I was cleaning the kitchen, etc. In general, I took on myself many chores that previously belonged to my mom.

That's where the problem starts - my mother claims that she's tired of having to ask me for everything and she wants me to figure out on my own that I should do something, for example clean the kitchen or notice that there's an empty plate next to her in her room that I can bring back to the kitchen and put in the dishwasher. 

However, I am not the smartest person in the world, I've never been good at tasks that need ""figuring out"" what to do. I prefer being given clear instructions and then go along with them. I'm not much perceptive and I often don't notice little details around me even if I try my best to see if there's anything that should be done by me.

Because of that, I often miss out on things my mom wants me to do around the house and this leads to her getting mad at me. In those moments, even if I ask her what I could do to help, she doesn't tell me anything and only gets angrier because I continue to not figure it out on my own.

My sister doesn't have such problem - she's younger, so my mother always tells her what she wants her to do. I wish it was the case with me. My mom never gets angry at my sister for not helping out while with me, it feels like she doesn't appreciate everything that I'm already doing (when she isn't in a bad mood and gives me instructions on what to do, I always do it) but instead only focuses on the part that I'm not clever and I can't figure out on my own that something needs to be done.

For context, I (23F) have been living with my friend (24F) for a few months. I am moving states in 6 so we will not be renewing. She has a dog that I knew about coming in. The dog has anxiety and accidents inside the house that she cleans up after but with our schedules I am forced to because I don‚Äôt like having dog waste in the floor until she gets home. I‚Äôm not a pet expert but several friends told me the dog is probably not taken care of to be going in the house that often. I‚Äôm not fond of the situation but I knew going in she had one pet and the lease will be over soon anyways. 

So three months ago, she suggested buying a cat. I told her no given that it feels like the dog is too much and I prefer to not have more than one pet in our shared space. Well, the other week she told me she is going to foster a cat. She said to be fair she will keep the food, water, and litter box in her room & the cat will be locked inside her room 24/7 so as to not go ‚Äúin my space‚Äù I told her I don‚Äôt know how that would work out given the apartment rooms are not that big. It also doesn‚Äôt seem ethical for me given that I‚Äôm not sure how all cats would like that. 

But she claims it‚Äôs within her right to do what she wants with her room and personal space. I just feel defeated at this point. I don‚Äôt know if the cat will end up really being confined there. She claims if it doesn‚Äôt work out with the cat liking being in one room the entire time she can easily return it.  On my end it just seems like she couldn‚Äôt take me saying no then and now as good enough reason to not understand why she can‚Äôt get another pet. She argues that it isn‚Äôt like a dog that needs as much attention when I brought up concerns about her dog. I asked her why she couldn‚Äôt wait the few months we have to get one and never replied to me about that.

41,1g807n5,AITA For Needing My Medical Aid Somewhere He's Not Welcome?,"My boyfriend Bug (34M) and I (21F) have been together for a couple of years and brought my service dog, Red, a 2.5-year-old golden retriever, to his sister's (36F) wedding. Red helps me with several psychiatric and medical conditions, including POTS, a seizure disorder, a panic disorder, and a balance/mobility disorder. I rely on him for safety, as he alerts me to fainting/seizures, assists with stairs, and provides grounding techniques during panic attacks (to name a few things).

My boyfriend's best friend, Ryan (28M), recently got engaged to Lexi (27F). During a lunch date, we mentioned that we had ordered Red a tuxedo for his sister's wedding. Ryan chuckled and said they don‚Äôt plan to have any dogs at their wedding. Ryan is aware of my conditions but believes that because I‚Äôm not blind and have my boyfriend with me, I don't need Red, and am simply just enjoying getting to bring him everywhere.

Lexi seemed surprised by Ryan's comment and defended me, stating she didn't think it was wrong of me to want to bring Red, explaining that he would behave just as he does now, quietly lying under the table. However, Ryan insisted that at ""his wedding,"" dogs were not welcome, calling it unsanitary and unnecessary because I don't need my service dog. In response, I mentioned that he should speak to his aunt about not bring her insulin pump, since she clearly doesn‚Äôt need her medical device at the wedding either. The conversation ended there, and Ryan glared at me for the rest of lunch.

Afterward, I felt heated about the situation. What I said about his aunt may have been rude, which won't make my case any stronger. I also understand he's not a dog person and isn't planning to have people bring animals to the wedding because it's his big day. But Ryan has always been vocal about his dislike for Red, despite him never causing any issues. The way Ryan talks to me and about me when Red is involved can feel very hurtful. I don't feel like I should have to defend my right to have him as my medical aid - especially to someone who's supposed to be a close friend.

Both Bug and Lexi think Ryan is being unreasonable about Red attending the wedding, while others suggest I‚Äôm being stubborn and shouldn‚Äôt try to ruin their wedding. So, AITA for needing to bring my service dog?

Edit to add some info:

* Red and I are from the United States, where there is no mandatory registration for service dogs. Red has been trained by me, starting at 11 weeks, and has passed the Canine Good Citizenship test, alongside a local public access test. His training and/or his status as a service dog is not up for debate here. 
* Bug and Lexi have both defended me and Red on numerous occasions, this is not the first time Ryan has been vocal on his distaste for Red. Bug has gotten into full-blown arguments with Ryan over his comments. Without giving too many details and going far into it, Ryan has demanded Red be kenneled in Bug and I's own house while he's there. No, he does not have an allergy to dogs. 
* The wedding itself isn't even planned, could be over a year until it happens. They just got engaged and are looking for public venues. This was a recent brief discussion, and nothing is set in stone. Bug is the best man, Lexi has mentioned me being a bridesmaid. I have an obligation to go, and would also very much like to go because I wish to support Bug and Lexi.
* I have ZERO intentions of just showing up with Red despite knowing Ryan's feelings. If the wedding is happening a year from now and Ryan is still firm that Red cannot go, Red will not be going. Simple as that.
* I wish to see other views from my own on the topic at hand (in a respectful manner if possible), but I intend to talk with at least Lexi about his stance. I would like to try and find middle ground, if possible. If we cannot find a middle ground, I can accept that and will not bring Red uninvited. But I'd like to try, not because I wish to make the wedding about me (I have several plans for how I can keep Red out of things), but because I can get hurt without him. I genuinely need him but really want to be there too.

The unit has two bathrooms. Mine is an ensuite, the other is the main bathroom.

A month or two after J moves in, she tells me that she‚Äôs actually a massive germaphobe and uncomfortable with guests using her bathroom. She requests that when I have guests over they use my bathroom. It seemed to really affect her, so I was okay to compromise and do that.

A few days later, my housemate asks if he had used her bathroom since she found urine on the rim of her toilet seat. I say no, I showed him where mine was when he needed to use it and he was with me the whole time otherwise. She appeared to accept that at the time.

Anyways, I have just been away for two weeks on a trip to Japan. The two weeks before I went away, J was housesitting and only returned to the house the day of my flight. I messaged her on the day to double check she was okay to look after the cats, but I never saw her in person. When I got home in seemed everything was fine.

Next day at around 11:30am, when J is at work, I receive an extremely long text, too long to screenshot, saying that a man must have used her bathroom whilst she was away housesitting and that she had locked the door (which I wasn‚Äôt aware of) before she left and it was now unlocked. She said she was anxious every time I had a guest over that they would use her bathroom, and this was proof that her boundary had been crossed.

I was shocked. No one had used her bathroom, the only person I had over at the house in that time was my brother. He didn‚Äôt use the bathroom the whole time he was there. 

The only thing that made sense to me with the unlocked door is that my cats had broken in. My cats have figured out how to bang on doors to break the latch, which my housemate had seen them do.

I offered to check the latch if she thought the cats had unlocked the door, but my housemate reiterated that a man must have used it since there was urine under the toilet seat. This was another very long text message.

Then came hours of back and forth with me reiterating that no one had used her bathroom, and her being convinced that it had to have been a man and couldn‚Äôt be splashback from her using her own toilet. She would say she would let it go, but then would ask to discuss it further. 

Here‚Äôs where I might be the asshole: I said that if she was truly this paranoid that someone had used her bathroom that she was anxious every time I had guests over, she needed to either seek help for it or look into living alone.

44,1g7ysvl,AITA FOR EXPLODING AT MY ROOMATE OVER 75¬¢? ,"I live in new york city in an appartment with a roomate I  had a pretty bad streak of roommates so when he moved in and we hit it off pretty well socially I decided to let a lot of red flags fly.
Such as:
.He works under the table (and often is completely broke
.He is an immigrant and has refused to move further in his processes and is therefore unable to receive benefits (food stamps, ect) 
.He is very messy and bum like 
. He is a pathological liar and the stories he tells never seem to add up.
. He is a crack addict / alchoholic ;I smoke weed and used to drink myself but after quitting drinking having a roomate who stumbles in drunk and loud at 3 am gets old.
.im a musician and he constantly craps on every song I show him, calling shit I spent weeks on lazy and not unique (an opinion but still kinda rude idk) 

I am kinda a crazy character myself and I try not to judge people. As long as his half of rent is mostly paid up and his mess is contained to his room im content to chill and smoke weed with him or whatever to an extent. (Although him never throwing in when he clearly has money for other things does get grating) 
However in the last few weeks I realized he has been stealing from me. 

At first it was just 75¬¢ off my nightstand, not a huge deal. What bothered me is that he lied about it so smoothly. Im pretty broke, so I was staring at that 75¬¢ all night dreaming about spending it on a cig in the morning. went to get a shower, when I came back the money was gone. 
I asked roomatey and he said it wasnt him ""why would he take 75 ¬¢ lol"". But The money didnt just disapear so it really bothered me. Like he was trying to make me feel crazy or doubt myself. If he would have just taken it and said  my bad i needed it for xyz it wouldnt matter but lying and manipulating me is another thing. 

A little while later, I was in my room laying on my floor ans i see roomatey saunter into my room look around briefly then go directly into my secret stash box where I keep my, weed, supplements, snacks and starts munching down on a bag of my pistachios he must not have noticed me on the floor but when I screamed ""ayo wtf man"" he turned towards me and said ""holy shit my bad man I must have been sleepwalking"". So im supposed to believe he sleepwalking into my room, looked around then pinpointed my stash spot exactly without even looking around. Ok. 
 a few days ago  I went to grab a handheld mirror  out of his room that he allowed me to use and its in a bag that has some other shit I was missing that I had previously asked him about. 

So basically, he came home and was like ""hey whats, up "" and I kinda freaked on him and said whats up is your a thief  and your not welcome to my company, my appliances ect. And since then ive totally cut him off, no weed, no movie nights or playstation. 
I feel kinda bad because it was only really a comb, some nuts and money and junk but at the same time i feel like lying is unacceptable

48,1g7y9ki,AITA for asking my boyfriend to help me?,"
So first off, I live in a pretty busy city with lots of parking space but most of it is almost always taken, still public transport here is good and you can easily get where you want to go.
So, for the situation at hand. Since I was little I always had issues with my feet, meaning I twist them easily, have broken a couple of bones in there because I took a wrong step and so on. On Friday I met with a long time friend, we drank a bit before heading off to a bar. All good until I twisted my ankle so violently that I had to go to the hospital via ambulance. 
Fast forward to yesterday, all is well for now, I can't really walk at the moment but I'm managing. My boyfriend is staying at his friend's home an hour or so by car from here and I wrote him to ask if he could come over to help me with grocery shopping and just in general help me out a bit. His answer was no, because ""he couldn't just drive over, there's nowhere to park""

We've tried finding a solution, but over and over again he was like ""I can't park there, two or three hours are not even worth it"" and so on. Then he offered to pick me up on Monday to spend the rest of the week at his house. I declined because to even get up to his house it's one flight of stairs and inside two, there's no way I'll be crawling them up every day for a week.

These were the basics of our conversation, it continued by us talking in circles until we just stopped writing. He once again texted me at like 1am to tell me that he was going to sleep, but acted like nothing ever happened. 

I really don't know if I'm overreacting right now, but I'm kind of used to helping out even if it's inconvenient sometimes. I remember that my best friend went out of her way to come over in pouring rain and without a jacket when I wasn't feeling well. Or me getting ready in the middle of the night to help out my friends.

The problem that's now still there and why I'm writing this in the first place is that he's making me out to be overdramatic and blowing things out of proportion where I just feel kind of abandoned what he doesn't seem to get.

 So AITA for asking him to help out and then not accepting his excuse of not finding a parking spot and also rejecting the idea to spend the week at his house?

49,1g7y4rh,AITA for demanding an apology from my partner because he made me late to my family thanksgiving?,"My (F 37) family thanksgiving was planned for this weekend and my partner (M 37) always loves my family dinners. My family lives about an hour and half away from us and my partner and I live separately.

The night before I told my partner I needed us to pick up my aunt on the way there, that I have plans to help my mom and do stuff for my family,and that I would like him to be at my place at 1130am and he agrees and says okay.

In the morning he always gets up super early. He texts me at 6am saying he has all these chores to do and maybe if he skips grocery shopping he can still be at my place on time but otherwise will be 30min to an hour late. My boyfriend is generally always late, I know this means he'll be at least an hour late if not more, and we've talked before about how it stresses me out and gives me anxiety to be late. So I immediately respond when I wake up at 830am and tell him to skip grocery shopping and get to mine on time instead. His response is that he already did grocery shopping and he has to finish his laundry and he's going to be late but he can drive without me. At this point he still had 2 to 3 hours to finish what he was doing and get to mine.

At this point I'm mad. I'm just pissed that his laundry is more important than me and my family. Important note that he already has clean clothes to wear. We argue. Eventually he texts my family directly to tell them he's going to be late and asks them if it's okay. I found this very childish and disrespectful. I don't want to drive separately because gas money, environment, optics. It's a long drive.

Eventually I stop arguing with him and just get ready and start cooking since I'm bringing a dish. I text him again saying I will wait for whenever he gets to mine. I wait for an hour and then call him and find out he had to take a walk to cool off and still has multiple things on his list to do before he leaves now. At this point I give up and say I can't be any later and I'm going without him.

When I pick up my aunt she's been waiting for an hour for me. We ended up getting to my moms at 245, more than hour after I had planned because traffic was bad. I didnt get to do some of the things I planned with my mom because a bunch of people were already there.

My partner showed up at around 4pm and I did my best to just let it go for the evening. Dinner was served at 6pm. This morning he texts asking if we're going to see each other today and my response was that I'm only interested in talking to him if he's ready to apologize. His response was that he'll apologize only if it's a mutual apology. I don't think I have anything to apologize for? I put up with him being late all the time, but my family thanksgiving is one of those rare occasions where I need him to prioritize me over LAUNDRY! He thinks I was not being reasonable and it was important for his mental health to do all his chores.

Eventually he texts my family directly to tell them he's going to be late and asks them if it's okay. I found this very childish and disrespectful. I don't want to drive separately because gas money, environment, optics. It's a long drive.

Eventually I stop arguing with him and just get ready and start cooking since I'm bringing a dish. I text him again saying I will wait for whenever he gets to mine. I wait for an hour and then call him and find out he had to take a walk to cool off and still has multiple things on his list to do before he leaves now. At this point I give up and say I can't be any later and I'm going without him.

When I pick up my aunt she's been waiting for an hour for me. We ended up getting to my moms at 245, more than hour after I had planned because traffic was bad. I didnt get to do some of the things I planned with my mom because a bunch of people were already there.

My partner showed up at around 4pm and I did my best to just let it go for the evening. Dinner was served at 6pm. This morning he texts asking if we're going to see each other today and my response was that I'm only interested in talking to him if he's ready to apologize. His response was that he'll apologize only if it's a mutual apology. I don't think I have anything to apologize for? I put up with him being late all the time, but my family thanksgiving is one of those rare occasions where I need him to prioritize me over LAUNDRY! He thinks I was not being reasonable and it was important for his mental health to do all his chores.

So reddit AITA for demanding an apology or should I be apologizing too?",2.0,0.9825268983840942,1,0

But a few years ago, we started spending xmas with my brothers best friends family instead.

At first it was nice, they put on a great spread, feed us nice food and it was nice to be part of a bigger group and i was grateful to be invited.

 But over the years, the rules became more and more strict. First, my brother and his best friends decided what kind of gifts were allowed to give - books only, even though i no longer read. (the next year, i asked if anyone read the books the got last year and no one had!! But we still have to give books anyway). 

Then, the conversations started to become very political, and it was obvious that unless you agreed with the ""in group"" you're treated like your opinion is wrong and you're a terrible person. (the funny thing is, we're both left wing, but they have a lot of ableistic beliefs i simply cannot agree with). 

Each year more and more of my brothers friends got added to the invite list and now i feel very outnumbered in these discussions. 

(It makes me uncomfortable because i have an invisible disability and they have conversations about how people like me shouldn't take medication and our disabilties aren't real - they believe in the pull up your bootstraps approach) 

My brother even started combining our last name with their best friends last name, by blending our names together. 

Because of all this, Christmas just stopped feeling fun. I feel ganged up on, and like I'm getting pushed out of my own family. My parents expressed that that really dont like it either and they just go because they feel like they have to.

I think it would be fair to say she experiences some very complex mental health however she expresses this through making irrational accusations about family members and actively trying to turn people against each other. She has also taken a lot of money from my parents over the years, claiming she was about to become homeless but then cutting them off once she has the money and never looking for a job or engaging in professional support. 2 years ago she just stopped talking to all of us, would not respond to calls, emails, texts etc. We were worried sick until her friend confirmed to us that she was OK.

I think it would be fair to say she experiences some very complex mental health however she expresses this through making irrational accusations about family members and actively trying to turn people against each other. She has also taken a lot of money from my parents over the years, claiming she was about to become homeless but then cutting them off once she has the money and never looking for a job or engaging in professional support. 2 years ago she just stopped talking to all of us, would not respond to calls, emails, texts etc. We were worried sick until her friend confirmed to us that she was OK.

58,1g7vq99,AITA for encouraging my aunt to help my backstabbing sister instead of trying to make me do it?,"My sister (26f) and I (27f) have not spoken in 7 years after she got pregnant with my then-boyfriend's child. I had been dating him for 5 years and he had talked about us getting married, which my sister knew. She told me about their affair publicly and did so in a way that made it seem like she was trying to paint me as some awful person for being with her unborn child's father instead of acknowledging the fact he was my partner who she slept with.

He called it off with her after I broke up with him and he wanted me back. My sister then wanted to make amends and I told both of them I never wanted to see their faces again. My sister tried to play the family card and the innocent child (her baby) card. Then she tried to play the ""we have shitty parents"" card claiming we needed each other. I told her I didn't need another terrible person in my life and she was as dead to me as our parents are.

Our aunt was someone who did look out for us when she realized we had shitty parents. She wasn't very involved but was the only family we really had. She hated what happened between us but never said much about it.

My sister and ex got back together and they had another kid and stayed together until last year or something. He ended up fucking her over and leaving her without a place to stay. She was also dumb to rely entirely on him. She lost her job during this too. She reached out to our aunt to find out if I could help her. My aunt told me my sister was homeless, jobless and her and her kids had nothing going for them. I told her it wasn't my problem. In response I got a voicemail my aunt forwarded on of my sister crying and apologizing and saying she really loves and misses me and she hates that she hurt me and she needs me more than ever and she just wants her big sister right now because her life's a mess. I told my aunt it wasn't my problem anymore.

My aunt dug deep to try and change my mind and she has told me multiple times I should step up as a sister. I told her I have no plans to help that backstabber. My aunt said we were all each other had for years and that should count for something. I told her it should have but didn't. My aunt pointed out I'm engaged to a wonderful guy and we're doing well for ourselves and have built a nice life together and I should reconcile with my sister and do better. I encouraged her to help my backstabber of a sister instead of trying to make me do it since she never wronged her and she's actually concerned about her. I told her it would be far more helpful. My aunt told me I sounded like our parents and I told her if I was like our parents my sister would never have thought for a single second she could even try to reach out to me. My aunt made it clear she thought less of me for my stance.

59,1g7v9v0,AITA for giving a friend a bill after hosting him?,"Update:

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm the AH here after going above and beyond for a person. We saved him probably $300-400 for this trip and did numerous favours for him. This person didn‚Äôt offer once to share gas for a long road trip, to share anything with us or to at least pay for his own expenses. The hotels shouldn‚Äôt have been assumed as a gift. It‚Äôs obvious. We also told him about the prices of everything upfront. Yet, when he heard something cost $xx and we had to pay, he sat silently.

We decided to give him that bill because we reminded him on day 6 to pay for his hotel, he did nothing; we went camping on day 8 and he prepared no food or drinks to share and only ate what we brought; At this point this was very poor manners. We, the hosts, shouldn‚Äôt have had to ask twice for hotel payments. We also saved him quite a bit with our resident discounts. 

The bill was less than $50 excluding the hotels. He‚Äôs on a budget, so we only took him to dirt cheap places to eat. I was going to let that slide to pay that $50 if he was grateful. But not a token of gratitude really upset me, hence the bill. He could have picked up a $8 meal just for once after 7 meals, you know? And the gall to ask us for rides to the airport on his last day when a taxi ride would be just $5. 

If you‚Äôre this cheap and ungrateful, I would give you a bill and make you reimburse us. He came here as a sad puppy after his breakup and we were extra nice to him and tried to distract him with amazing nature here. If he came with a partner they‚Äôd on mostly on their own. 

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-


A friend came to visit my country for 10 days and stayed with me and my partner. To show his gratitude, he brought us 4 bottles of wine , around ‚Ç¨6-8 each.

We drove him for over 1,000km for a few days to take him on adventurous trips around the country. It‚Äôs usually expensive to rent a 4x4 and hire a tour guide here. We were essentially his driver, tour guide and host. We prepared a guestroom for him with toiletries in his own bathroom, made all bookings, and prepared camping gear for him. 

I thought the wine he brought would even out our ‚Äúservice‚Äù for him, and we picked him up at the airport at 4:30am to be a good host. 

However, every time I took out my card to pay for our meals, he sat silently. I was happy to treat him for the first meal or two as a host, but after 6 days (like 7 meals), his silence unsettled me. The same when we had to pay for attractions, gas or groceries. No thank you, no offering, nothing. Just sat silently.

I admit I was never upfront with him about finances. I just assume as an adult in his 30s with a professional job in Germany, he would offer to pay for his share, chip in, or take turns to pay for meals. 

He also never mentioned paying us back for the hotels we paid for him. I consulted him on the prices before booking, so he should know he had to pay. He only brought $200 cash here, and his hotels were already over $200. He didn‚Äôt seem to plan to pay us back in cash.

I was antsy. He also rented a sedan for city sightseeing in between but the car rental was at the airport. We gave him a ride to the airport at first, and he hinted he wanted more rides from us to take him home after he dropped off the car, and a ride to the airport for his 4:20am flight. I told him to take a taxi, it‚Äôs less than ‚Ç¨6. 

On his last day, a few hours before he flew, he still mentioned nothing. We presented him with a bill for his hotel, meals and groceries. He seemed taken aback. We told him we spared the gas in exchange for his wine. 

AITAH for giving him a bill that listed out all his expenses? As a host I should be more gracious, or upfront if I were transactional, but his silence, not even a thank you, upset me and made me give him a bill. 

This person is not close to me. We met on a trip 8 years ago and hadn‚Äôt seen each other for 6 years. He was interested in seeing my country.

Edit:

A lot of you asked why I paid for his hotel upfront. We got special discounts as residents so it had to be under our name, and in another booking we not only got resident discount but also added him to our room (an extra bed) so he could save more. I communicated clearly, told him we got him a discount, and he asked how much the rooms cost. He knew he had to pay.

On day 6, we asked him how he would pay us back for the hotels after knowing he didn‚Äôt have the cash for us, he said transfer. We hoped he would take the initiative to make the transfer before he left, but he stayed silent the whole time, until we asked again on his last day. My partner and I felt it‚Äôs bad manners to make the host ask you twice about payment, so we ended up being blunt with him about the bill to draw boundaries. 

As for meals, we often ordered a family plate/few dishes to share so it‚Äôs hard to have a separate bill. 

I didn‚Äôt invite him to come. He saw my photos on social media and planned to come with his girlfriend, but then they broke up and he came alone. If they were two people coming it‚Äôs more obvious we would split bills 50/50, and they wouldn‚Äôt have stayed with us for this long. We felt pity for him after his breakup and wanted to be nice.

They've been together for about 7 years and married for 4. It's been 5.5 of knowing them for me. I don't like my dad's wife. I find her really bad with respecting boundaries and overly pushy. When she was still only dating my dad she showed up to be a parent chaperone for my class field trip even though she and dad knew mom was doing it and I had already said no to her. She kept trying to make me walk closer to her than my mom too. When I ignored her mostly she got really pissy about it. Dad told me I could have appreciated that she wanted to be there for me.

When they were engaged she made me come dress shopping with her and kept pushing for me to give feedback on the dress. I said repeatedly I didn't care. She told me I should help my new ""bonus mom"" find the perfect dress. I pulled a disgusted face and she asked what that was for. I told her she wasn't my bonus mom and I hated that title. She told me she doesn't want to be my stepmom. She wants to be my bonus aka second mom and I didn't have to like it but I had to lump it and one day I'll love her back.

When schools were virtual because of Covid and I had to go to my grandma's house while mom worked she showed up at grandma's house and tried to take me to her and dad's house. My grandma threatened to call the police on her because she wasn't supposed to be there. A few times she brought her daughter to try and make us give in. Didn't work.

So yeah, I don't like her. I just about tolerate her. But I don't care about her at all and I'm not super worried for her now. Her pregnancy is high risk and she was diagnosed with a pretty risky illness/condition. It's her kidney and something else. But after she found out she was pregnant she started getting really sick and this diagnosis makes the pregnancy high risk too. She goes to the hospital three times a week for treatment and has to stay in bed when at home. When dad has parenting time he makes me get lunch ready for me, his wife and her daughter and I'm supposed to see if she needs anything. I do it as a chore not because I care. But now they expect me to go to his house for a bit after school when it's mom's parenting time and make lunch for her and her daughter. I refused and mom had my back. Dad told me I should be doing more to help because this is my family and my unborn (half) sibling at risk and my ""bonus mom"". When I didn't give in dad told me I should be more mature and understand compassion and helping family.

Her kids are not my dad's kids btw. They're from her ex but he wasn't really around so her kids lived with us 100%. Dad had me and my brother (20m). Our mom died when I was 6.

Dad and Helen's marriage started to fall apart a year ago and he filed for divorce months ago. Helen and her kids moved out. But Helen expected me and my brother to still play a role in the lives of her kids. She said the four of us were siblings after 7 years and we disagreed. We paid her kids much attention or acted like older siblings to them. They did call us their siblings though. So I know they actually saw me as a sister and my brother as a brother. But we never said siblings. We'd say stepsiblings or Helen's kids depending on who we talked to.

Helen's youngest had their birthday a couple of weeks ago. Dad wasn't invited but me and my brother were and we didn't go. Helen came to the house the next day while dad was out and tried to berate me but I didn't open the door. She yelled in at me for a few minutes and left. She called my brother a few times from an unknown number because he blocked her. When she couldn't get him to answer she found me waking home from school and told me we needed to talk and I told her we don't, she's not a part of my life anymore. She told me her kids don't deserve to lose their siblings because of a divorce. I told her we were never their siblings. I told her I wasn't going to pay more attention to them now that her and dad were divorcing than I did during their marriage. She told me I watched them grow up and how could I not adore them. I told her I never paid that much attention to them.

She tried to play the ""parent"" card and I told her I don't need to listen to her anymore because she's not my dad's wife anymore or won't be soon. I told her she has no authority over me and she needs to accept it and help her kids accept what's happened instead of bugging us.

She called me cold while I was walking away from her and then she called dad to rant at him about me disrespecting her like that.

Helen's youngest had their birthday a couple of weeks ago. Dad wasn't invited but me and my brother were and we didn't go. Helen came to the house the next day while dad was out and tried to berate me but I didn't open the door. She yelled in at me for a few minutes and left. She called my brother a few times from an unknown number because he blocked her. When she couldn't get him to answer she found me waking home from school and told me we needed to talk and I told her we don't, she's not a part of my life anymore. She told me her kids don't deserve to lose their siblings because of a divorce. I told her we were never their siblings. I told her I wasn't going to pay more attention to them now that her and dad were divorcing than I did during their marriage. She told me I watched them grow up and how could I not adore them. I told her I never paid that much attention to them.

She tried to play the ""parent"" card and I told her I don't need to listen to her anymore because she's not my dad's wife anymore or won't be soon. I told her she has no authority over me and she needs to accept it and help her kids accept what's happened instead of bugging us.

She called me cold while I was walking away from her and then she called dad to rant at him about me disrespecting her like that.

63,1g7uhs1,"AITA for expecting my roommate to nudge his cat down from the dining table?
","I (31F) live in a house with a 3 roommates. one of them (27M), has a cat, who we all love. but he doesnt take proper care of the cat all the time. for example, whenever the cat poops or pukes in the house, he doesnt show any urgency in cleaning it up. it has been us who clean it up so many times. i myself have cleaned the cat's puke in the morning because it was right at the door, and the cat's owner was sleeping at that time. i also feed it at times, and i do not mind doing these at all.

now, the cat has a habit of climbing on top of the dining table or the drawing room table. we eat food there. recently it also puked on top of the dining table. yesterday, we had a house meeting, where everyone was supposed to put forward their opinions about the cat. the other two roommates are equally, if not more enraged by the cat situation in the house. but it fell on me to bring it up. so i did. i told the cat owner, that maybe we need to gently nudge the cat down from the tables every time he climbs on top of the tables. because he also climbs on top of tables when there is food kept, and he also sheds fur. if we make a habit out of him to never climb the table, then it is simpler to discipline the cat. to this, the cat owner got very frustrated with me, called me names, called me morally wrong, etc. he said he cannot allow the cat to be nudged away from the tables. he suggested that he will provide wet wipes to us, so that we can clean the table before we start eating. he also said that we can nudge the cat away in case it comes near when we are having food on the tables. but i suggested that it is easier to discipline him if we nudge him away from the table all the time. the other two roommates took the side of the cat owner.

am i the asshole? i already feel like i am. but i feel very cornered and betrayed by the other two roommates. at one point in the argument, i also said to the cat owner that the house is as much as mine as much it is the cat's. so if he wants, he can move to a more comfortable space with his cat, where he can discipline his cat the way he wants to, but if he is living in the same house as other people, then he has to maintain some rules as well. i know i shouldnt have suggested that he moves out. but i am the one who found this house, and i am the one who is having to suffer all these.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-20,"AITA for expecting my roommate to nudge his cat down from the dining table?

Last night, I invited a group of school friends to my house for a sleepover. I was really excited to have them over because I thought I successfully got friends, despite me having a bit of an accent that I was insecure about. 

My grandmother was home, and she does not speak a word of English. At the beginning, when I introduced her to my friends, I got a weird vibe because I saw them laughing among themselves at her broken English. I wasn't sure at the moment, but it felt off and I shook it off.

Later, when my mother called us down to dinner, one of them made a joke about the smell. My grandmother was really happy that I got friends and she cooked some traditional food for them. My friends sat down and didn't really eat the food. They picked at it and one of them asked if we can get pizza instead. My grandmother came and asked me if my friends didn't like the food, because they only picked at it. I didn't really have the heart to tell her what they were saying. I felt really left out because my friends were laughing with each other and saying how much they like pizza, pasta, and other things, obviously mocking the food that my grandmother had made. I was really frustrated and I told them to not be rude. They just giggled and said nothing more.

The third incident was later that night. I was getting ready in the bathroom and they were in my room. I over heard them laughing and saying why my grandmother was wearing a costume in the house, as she was wearing a traditional dress from Pakistan. I also heard them whisper that she smelled bad. That was when I got really angery and I came out of the bathroom and exclaimed loudly for them to shut up. 

My friends all told me that I was going too far and they were just joking. However, I don't want them to disrespect me, my country, and my grandmother in my own house. I told them to get out of my house. They were upset and left, driving away. It was around 11 O'Clock at Night. 

I don't really know what to do now because they were my only friends and I feel like kicking them out was too much. I tried texting them afterwards and they blocked me.

71,1g7t8z2,AITA for refusing to help with my brothers lizard,"I (19F) and my brother (15M) where given 2 bearded dragons by someone i know. We orginally where only going to take in the one, which id be solely looking after. However, my brother said he would also take care of a lizard, and my dad decided we should take in the other one in so he would ""stay away from my lizard"" (so he wouldnt constantly ask to hold my lizard etc). Personally, i didnt think it was a good idea as we also have 2 guinea pigs, one of which is his, and apart from cleaning the cage out every other week (we take turns), he doesnt interact with them at all anymore.

I told my brother and both my parent, when we got the other lizard that I wouldn't be looking after the it for him, that he would have to feed him, get him out and clean his tank, he agreed and dismissed anything further on it.

Well, 2 months down the line, hes constantly forgetting to feed him and give him, and in general not looking after him well enough. 

Its now turned into arguments with my mom, she asks me constantly to feed him etc, and when i turn around and say no, my brother should be doing all this like he agreed to, she gets angry with me and huffs and puffs about her having to do it instead

I had a solution to this, i sat my brother down and told him that i will move his lizard into my room and take over caring for him, that he can get the lizard out whenever he wanted, but i do not want to see the lizard paying for the fact that he is currently showing that he cant take care of him. I did say that if he starts showing he can take care of the lizard, then we'll move him back. He agreed and i made sure to explain why i was saying about this, and i started re-arraging my room to fit 2 lizards. 

The next day, my parents told me that apparently he didnt want to move the lizard into my room but felt like he had no choice, eventhough i did let him know that we didnt have to, but if we didnt move him, i would be having absolutely nothing to do with the lizard. That pissed me off because if he had just said no, he didnt want to move him, i wouldnt of spent 2 days re-arraging my room. When my brother got home, i said id financially pay for most of the lizards stuff, other than that im doing nothing. He said okay and shut himself away in his room. 

That happened a week ago and if anything, its gotten worse, no water in his bowl, not turning his heat lamp on until 12pm, not feeding, and my moms been getting more pissed that im refusing to feed him or help with him, and that she has to do it, i told her that ive said multiple times im not helping with him anymore.

I feel so bad for the poor lizard, maybe im being too harsh about not wanting to look after his lizard too, but i work full time, I don't have the time to look after 2 anyway, but i still offered and said id make it work, he said no, so im not helping.

Well, 2 months down the line, hes constantly forgetting to feed him and give him, and in general not looking after him well enough. 

Its now turned into arguments with my mom, she asks me constantly to feed him etc, and when i turn around and say no, my brother should be doing all this like he agreed to, she gets angry with me and huffs and puffs about her having to do it instead

I had a solution to this, i sat my brother down and told him that i will move his lizard into my room and take over caring for him, that he can get the lizard out whenever he wanted, but i do not want to see the lizard paying for the fact that he is currently showing that he cant take care of him. I did say that if he starts showing he can take care of the lizard, then we'll move him back. He agreed and i made sure to explain why i was saying about this, and i started re-arraging my room to fit 2 lizards. 

The next day, my parents told me that apparently he didnt want to move the lizard into my room but felt like he had no choice, eventhough i did let him know that we didnt have to, but if we didnt move him, i would be having absolutely nothing to do with the lizard. That pissed me off because if he had just said no, he didnt want to move him, i wouldnt of spent 2 days re-arraging my room. When my brother got home, i said id financially pay for most of the lizards stuff, other than that im doing nothing. He said okay and shut himself away in his room. 

That happened a week ago and if anything, its gotten worse, no water in his bowl, not turning his heat lamp on until 12pm, not feeding, and my moms been getting more pissed that im refusing to feed him or help with him, and that she has to do it, i told her that ive said multiple times im not helping with him anymore.

I feel so bad for the poor lizard, maybe im being too harsh about not wanting to look after his lizard too, but i work full time, I don't have the time to look after 2 anyway, but i still offered and said id make it work, he said no, so im not helping. So, AITA for refusing to help look after my brothers lizard? ",0.0,0.0219180658459663,0,1

For a little background our parents are not the best, they were constantly fighting as I grew up, and I was surrounded by anger. However when we moved they diled it down so my little brother didn't deal with the yelling or anger. 

I have been struggling with my mental health recently and I've told my mom but she hasn't done anything, so I know I can't go to her.

Today me and my little brother were carving pumpkins, my mom was helping him and he accidentally carved a design wrong so he started to get overwhelmed and started to cry. Now my mom isnt a big emotion fan so she got annoyed and started to yell at him, which made him cry even more. I had to yell so she could hear me because she was yelling, I told her that yelling doesn't help and she needs to calm down.

She got even more mad and yelled more casuing my brother to storm off to his room. My mom got more annoyed and more angry which caused me and her to get into a argument. I told her that she needs to be gentle with him and that his feelings are important and need to be acknowledged instead of ignored and neglected. She said that he shouldn't be crying cause there was nothing to cry about and that he's just dramatic and he needs to get over it. 

After the argument ended I went to my brother, comforted him and made sure he knew that I was there and I would help him with whatever he needs.

However, as he aged, he became more short-tempered and grumpy.

In late 2015, I unintentionally caused him trouble by posting a critical but non-insulting review of a doctor on social media (internet freedom is a joke in where I'm from). I was using his Wi-Fi, so the police contacted him because of the complaint. He rushed to my parents' home and had altercation with them, as he hates being on the wrong side of law. After the incident, we all apologized, and a non-prosecution decision was made by the court. My aunt was embarrassed by my UIL's behavior. I apologized to him again and again. He said he would let it go.

A few weeks later, in early 2016, I started applying to PhD programs and needed 3 reference letters. I had 2 and UIL agreed to help and submitted references for several schools, but when I asked for another one for ABC College, he refused, saying he had written enough letters. I found another professor to be my third reference and submitted a new application without UIL's name.

In June 2016, I was accepted to ABC College, and we wanted to celebrate with a family dinner.

A little context here me and my talking stage I‚Äôve been talking for a little bit now we‚Äôve gone our multiple trips together, that me and my mom paid a majority of, and he paid for his own wants and whatever . and we‚Äôve been through a lot together. We‚Äôre gonna call my talking stage Jason. Jason had recently invited me to go to a Halloween event with him and his two friends. He mentioned that I had to pay for myself although his two friends were paid for by him, he said if I cannot afford that we can make an alternative decision and go to a couple cheap haunted houses. I‚Äôm a little upset though ‚Äò cause I don‚Äôt know why he would bring up or invite me to something that I had to pay for myself when he mentioned that he‚Äôs paying for his friends. Keep in mind he‚Äôs always with his friends and he pays for them all the time and often I pay for the things that involve me and him, hes only ever bought me redbulls and flowers once. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm being greedy or needy because we are just a talking stage and we do know that we like each other, he quotes he loves me. but I‚Äôm just think it‚Äôs unfair because he always pays for his friends drinks and food and they‚Äôre always at his house 247 and leave me no time to hang out with him myself. It‚Äôs not like he doesn‚Äôt have money because he‚Äôs always paying for his friends alcohol groceries and just simple wants. AITA for being mad? 

UPDATE: for those wondering we are in our early 20s, and when i say ‚Äútalking stage‚Äù i refer to as we do everything that average couples would do, but we haven‚Äôt labeled it as official. most likely used the wrong term but we‚Äôve been ‚Äútalking‚Äù for a long couple months now and we‚Äôve been to mexico together, and showered together, slept in the same bed (no sex). we and Jason have had multiple talks about locking it down and making it official but he hasn‚Äôt asked me the official question . i fully understand that he is not my ‚ÄúBoyfriend‚Äù but i think its still common respect. especially if he refers to me as ‚Äúhis girl‚Äù.

80,1g7q6zx,AITA for keeping money from the sale of a business share instead of reinvesting it back into the business? ,"UPDATE: Thanks all for the judgements and comments; many of you helped shed new light and a different perspective on this issue, which I greatly appreciate. I sent my husband the link to this and he was genuinely surprised that no one seemed to agree with him, so he‚Äôs acknowledged that the way he thought about this was wrong. However, the fact that I had to go to Reddit raised some concerns for me, namely with regard to ownership percentages and control, so we‚Äôve decided to put a pin in this until we can sit down and talk further. I think both of us were operating under some assumptions that became jarringly obvious are not valid. Thanks again Redditors!

I bought a business that my husband wants to be a part of and help to grow, which I love, because he brings a lot to the table. He wants to buy a 50% share of the business, which I agreed to. We agreed on a price. He transferred the money into the business checking account (which I already gave him access to) and thinks it should stay there. He doesn‚Äôt want me drawing it out into my personal checking account. I think it‚Äôs my right to do so because the business is an asset that I owned 100% and agreed to sell to another party, and it doesn‚Äôt matter if it‚Äôs him or anyone else, when you sell an asset you own, that money is yours to do with what you will. I told him that as an investor he‚Äôs allowed to have strings attached to his buy-in, and I have the right to decline if I don‚Äôt like those strings. I borrowed from my emergency savings to buy the business and would like to pay myself back, and put the remainder back into the business. AITA?

Contextual info: 
- the business is cash positive and has ~90 months of operating runway without his investment; the cash is just in a different bank as we‚Äôre in the process of switching over. He has access to the other account and has seen it. It‚Äôll be into the new account within 10 days. He wants me to keep 100% of his investment in the new account because he wants operating money which I understand; I offered to leave 3 months worth in there until the other account is closed and everything is transferred over and he wasn‚Äôt happy with that. 
- no I‚Äôm not going to leave my husband over this lol
- anonymous because he‚Äôs on Reddit too and while he knows of my love of fanfiction I don‚Äôt need him knowing everything 
- ETA: we have no joint finances except one account we use to pay household expenses out of; we married a little later in life and view/handle all of our finances and investments independently.

81,1g7q2l6,AITA for calling my family out for not recognizing my bday?,"My (36) birthday was at the beginning of the month. The last 10 years or so,  i stopped celebrating it for mental health reasons. Basically everyone would usually forget, i would get depressed, and i figured out was just better to stop getting my hopes up so i wouldn't be disappointed. 

This last year, however, has been one of the hardest I've been through. I've been severely depressed, been dealing with an injury that i just found out has caused permanent damage to my back, and lost my job due to the injury. I've been dealing with all of this by myself, while trying to navigate helping care for my terminally ill father and little sister acting out because she's struggling with her own stuff. 
Basically, it's been a lot and for once I really needed a day that focused on celebrating me, because I've been feeling more alone then ever. I get that's probably stupid, but I just needed SOMETHING. 

I talked to my family about it and they agreed to do something nice for me this year. My birthday rolls around, and.. nothing. Mom and i talked, she said ""we're doing something this weekend."" Great! I'm excited! Weekend rolls around and instead she takes my little sister out to go get her hair and nails done and to go shopping. I was crushed. 

A few weeks to by and my mom asks me to take my little sister out to go get some stuff because she's been depressed and stressed out. I was busy with appointments so i said i couldn't. Mom asked me to reschedule my appointments because my little sister needed me and said i was being selfish by not putting family first. 

This is where i feel like I may be the AH. When i heard her say this,  i lost it. I basically told her how it was funny that I'm the selfish one when i have dropped everything everyday for everyone else. But none of them could even be bothered enough to wish me a happy birthday, so i clearly don't matter to any of them. Now I'm getting calls from my family telling me I'm an AH because she's dealing with a lot and it's not fair to hold it against her for forgetting about my bday and i need to grow up.

I'll try to keep it short.

My wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys.

I was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.¬† His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers.

I told him sure, I'd even buy it for him.

I told him he could keep the trimmer but wife seems pursed. I did remind him to keep the bathroom free of little hairs... get brothers to help/advise if needed, or me... and don't make the mistake of going all Kojak below the belt, Liam made that mistake a couple of years ago. With much itching.

Thanks everyone. I'm overwhelmed by all the comments, I only expected a few views/responses.¬† I appreciate all who commented. I read them all even if I could not reply back to each.'

All's good here. Last night I talked with my wife, as many theorized she is just wistful that the last baby bird is growing up (although all are still in the nest). She knows none of them will be little boys forever but she was (and is) such a good ""boy mom"" that she's missing those times already... and had a not-so-great reaction. That's ALL there is to it. Thankfully.

As for Tanner, I went up to the oldest's¬†room¬†where all three were hanging out (you never know where the posse of hooligans will be). Tanner said ""Check it out!"" stood up and dropped his shorts in a flash.. and yep, the hedge clippers had been at work. I told him great job, looks good. He said ""Liam had to do most of it."" Liam shrugged.¬† I'm very blessed that they all get along so well and that the older two are excellent big brothers (MOST of the time).

To a couple of ppl who DM'ed me, no none of us are nudists or anything like that LOL but they are definitely those never-wear-shirts guys, and when getting ready to go out you never know which one or ONES will be in the shower. The guys are just self assured (maybe too much), and not a shy bone in their bodies. Years ago TWICE my oldest (who had long hair then) went as Tarzan for Halloween. And my middle boy once went to a neighborhood costume contest as Michael Phelps in nothing but a Speedo and eight gold medals around his neck (and this was years after Phelps won).¬†

I'll try to keep it short.

My wife and I have three boys, 17, 16, and 14. May the lord have mercy on my soul. Actually they are good guys.

I was at Target with my youngest, Tanner. We split for a while and he shows back up asking if he could buy something with his own money. It was a beard trimmer. I laughed and told him he didn't need that yet. He explained nope, not for his face, he wanted it for downstairs.¬† His older brothers both manscape and he wanted to as well. But they wouldn't loan their trimmers.

I told him sure, I'd even buy it for him.

3. I put my bookbag on or next to MY chair at the table. I hadn't heard about this bothering R until Weds, but she said she can no longer be my friend because this was ""disrespecting her boundaries"".

4. I have cleaned the bathroom 2x since living here (we are on a cyclical rotation of chores). I've never cleaned a bathroom before.

5. My dad sent an electric scooter to get to work. They aren't legal here. No one will buy it. It was under the desk in the entryway from June to Aug bc I didn't have a bikeroom key (wasn't on the lease). I got a bikeroom key and it has been in the bikeroom since then.

92,1g7niri,AITA for filming my friend while we were high to capture a special moment?,"

My friend and I were smoking weed together in my home for the first time, having a great time, laughing and enjoying ourselves. I thought it would be great to capture the moment, so I pulled out my phone and started filming us just for 5 seconds, when suddenly my friend got really upset and asked me to delete the video, which I did in front of him (and from the trash) right away. We were just laughing and having a good time nothing obscene.

After that, though, he became paranoid and started accusing me of ruining the mood, and even began questioning our friendship. We‚Äôve always been close, like brothers, friends for a decade, and this kind of reaction was unexpected as we‚Äôve never had this happen before.I didn‚Äôt mean to upset him‚ÄîI just like recording good memories; am a photographer and am known among our group to record memories. 

He is also visiting from out of town, I let him stay free of charge for a week). Now, things are tense between us. He‚Äôs staying with me for one more night, but he seems distant, and he‚Äôs acting like he doesn‚Äôt trust me anymore. Normally we‚Äôd hug like brothers, but he could only offer a fist bump. I feel bad for upsetting him, but I didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time.

AITA for filming him in the first place? I regret doing it now but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm completely at fault. The weed seems to have amplified his paranoia many fold, and even now that he has sobered he still seems distant. 

I‚Äôve already tried to explain I just wanted to capture a wonderful memory of laughter. However on his side he was really looking forward to unwinding, sharing his heart out and being vulnerable; when me pulling my phone out really destroyed that vibe for him. In the moments after the incident he was very distant and any approaches from me were met with quite a guarded stance; with me even feeling he would even lash out with fists if I tried to hug him/get in his personal space.

He has mentioned in the past when he takes weed he gets very vulnerable and super paranoid;  but in a super safe space he can have the time of his life, crying, sharing and laughing. The latter is what we were experiencing right before I pulled my phone out, the former is what happened immediately after I  pulled my phone out.

While I know I triggered the response, aita in this situation? We go back so many years as buddies; saddened this zero intention for causing harm has caused such harm to our friendship. We‚Äôve never had issues in our friendship until this moment.

This happened last night and he has yet to wake. So I‚Äôm hoping he wakes up and we can just talk it out, but he seemed quite sober by the end of the evening yet still visibly very disappointed , guarded and pissed off.

93,1g7n80g,WIBTA if I said no to an all expenses paid trip with my wife?,"A little bit of background:

I (28m) and my wife (28f) have been married for about 3 years. My wife's family is pretty well off (lower upper class, net worth of easily over 1 mil), especially compared to how I grew up (large family, food stamps, thrift store Christmas). This has never bothered me, especially since it is nice that we have a safety net financially. My wife is incredible- she is down to earth, kind to everyone, and is just an awesome human being all around. She does not act entitled and is content with our current socio-economic status. My in-laws are great as well, they are supportive of us and do so much for us. We disagree on politics, but it's not much of an issue since my wife and I don't engage with them if it's brought up.

I am a high school teacher (important detail) and my wife is finishing her undergrad this year, while also working part time as a barista. Money is tight, but we make it work. My in-laws go on a trip to the neighboring state every spring and have been wanting us to come along for a few years now. They typically go at times when school is in session, making it impractical for us to go on a 10 day trip, which has been the reason we've declined going in the past.



Okay, so here's the thing:

At our most recent family dinner, my MIL mentioned that she looked at my school's academic calendar and booked an Airbnb for the week of my spring break. For 10 days. She went on to talk about how we would all stay at the house she booked. She also said we could all take their car to save on gas (18 hour drive). My MIL also explicitly stated that all meals, drinks, and lodging would be covered by them. All in all, I do believe she is well-meaning in all of this.

The problem is, I don't want to go on this trip.

I didn't say anything to my MIL at the time, but I expressed my frustration with my wife afterward. A 10-day trip would mean we leave the day after school gets out, and not get home until the night before I would return to work. 10 days is a long time for a trip with family, especially when you're in the car with them for a collective 36 hours. It makes sense financially for us to drive with them, but two 18 hour drives with my in-laws, on top of staying in the same house with them, sounds really draining. I am a fairly introverted person and need space to myself to recharge and not be a miserable person. Lol.

My biggest problem though, is that my MIL didn't even mention that she was going to book this trip until she had already done so. She didn't ask if we had any conflicts, she just assumed we would go on the trip, without ever mentioning it to either of us.

When I brought these concerns up to my wife, she was understanding but also said it would be an asshole move to say no to the trip. She says that it would hurt her parents if we said no, especially since they are paying for literally everything.

It makes sense financially for us to drive with them, but two 18 hour drives with my in-laws, on top of staying in the same house with them, sounds really draining. I am a fairly introverted person and need space to myself to recharge and not be a miserable person. Lol.

My biggest problem though, is that my MIL didn't even mention that she was going to book this trip until she had already done so. She didn't ask if we had any conflicts, she just assumed we would go on the trip, without ever mentioning it to either of us.

When I brought these concerns up to my wife, she was understanding but also said it would be an asshole move to say no to the trip. She says that it would hurt her parents if we said no, especially since they are paying for literally everything.

So, Reddit, would I be the asshole for saying no to this trip?",0.0,1.018497109413147,1,0
94,1g7meww,AITA for getting a car towed?,"So this morning, my family and I left around 9 to go run some errands. While we were out, the guys cutting our tree called to ask if our car was parked out front with a very flat tire. I told them it was not and didn't know who it belonged to. We got home shortly after around 11. As the car had a flat and was in the way, I went to ask the neighbors if they knew who it belonged to. No one knew. The tree cutters had told us they could come back out next weekend to finish. After asking around and because I needed the car gone as no one had shown up to claim it, I called the non-emergency line to ask if it needed to be towed. Dispatch took the information down and sent someone to check. 

At 1245, an officer showed up to verify that it was me who called and told me they would call it in as it had a flat and couldn't be left in the street. Finally, around 4 a lady comes storming up to our door and demands to know if I was the one to call the cops. I responded that yes and that I had work needing done on my tree and she was in the way and I thought the car was abandoned as it had a flat. She then screams that she was at a funeral and was ""just down the street."" The issue with this statement is that the nearest funeral home is at least 15 minutes away by car. After swearing at me and my wife, she stormed back to her car. I watched as she called a tow truck to come get her car and then proceeded to head back to the house she had come from two houses down and went inside. After 20 minutes or so, she came back and waoted in her car for the truck.

 The tow truck showed up, and the first thing she did was point at our house and say we had called him. The driver fixed her tire and gave the lady the receipt, and again, she tried to say that we had to pay. The driver responded, ""You chose to park here,"" and handed her the receipt. As he walked away, he said, "" Make stupid choices , get stupid consequences."" She then got in her car and sped off, blowing through the stop sign.   
SSo, AITA for calling the non emergency line for a car i thought was left anonded because I needed it moved for the large triluck and woodchiper that needed to be parked where the car was and wanted to avoid the treecutters potentially damaging the car?

I‚Äôd had one lesson with a proper instructor before this happened and usually my mum teaches me. My nana likes to tell all of us grandkids that she‚Äôs the most amazing driver because she taught all her kids to drive, but my mum tells me that it was actually my grandad who taught them to drive. My nana is also probably in the early stages of dementia. 

One day last week, my nana took me and my little cousin to an ice cream place for lunch and ice cream (obviously). I‚Äôve noticed lately that her driving is getting pretty reckless (pulling out in front of people, almost rear-ending people, she ran a red light, almost hit a pedestrian) and it made me feel pretty unsafe being in a car with her driving. 

Anyway, as we were just about to go home, a cop pulled her over for dangerous driving or something, maybe speeding, and told her not to drive. My nana was furious and refused to not drive, even refused to give the cop her licence so eventually I just offered to drive because I had my licence and technically my nana is a supervisor. 

I got in the drivers seat and was going pretty well except for my nana complaining and venting. The drive was maybe 1/2 and hour and the whole time my nana wouldn‚Äôt stop talking about how stupid the cop was and how she‚Äôs perfectly fine to drive. Eventually she ended up trying to get me to agree with her, but I struggle with driving and talking to someone else, so I kind of just said ‚Äúyeah i guess‚Äù. She kept badgering me, and I was getting really overwhelmed because I‚Äôve only been driving for like a month and it was very busy on the road. 

Then my nana kind of grabbed my arm because she wanted me to look at her and I just pushed her hand off me and yelled ‚ÄúPlease do not touch me while I‚Äôm driving!‚Äù 

She was really shocked and my cousin was too, and then we were all in silence for the rest of the drive.

96,1g8cb4z,AITA for not going to my cousins wedding?,"Back story, I ahead of time told my cousin (T) I wouldn't be attending her wedding because it's roughly around my due date. I have a history of pre term labor, so I did not go (36 weeks pregnant). She was super understanding (or so I had thought) but then I noticed a week later that my other cousin, her sister (C) unfriended me on facebook.



When I asked C why she unfriended me, she essentially dropped a whole list of things on me saying that I couldn't go to the wedding but I had posted pictures of my kids at the zoo (which is true. we stopped briefly at the local zoo a few weeks prior while traveling out of the way to return large items that were unshippable to ikea because we needed the money, but we utilized our membership for 30 min or so while there since it's like 2 hours away from us).



C also said that I only give 3-4 weeks notice for events that I invite them to, which gives her little no time to make schedule changes to attend so she doesn't come. She states I only invite my husbands family to things (which conflicts with her previous statement, but his dad and sister are the only ones we have a relationship with because his moms side is mostly all passed). She then mentioned that she stopped inviting me to her kids things because I never attend their events (however, it's been a couple years since an actual invite to anything and other than this wedding I can't think of anything she's invited us to in years).



C then said I am obviously ""embarrassed of my side of the family"" which feels very left field and confusing. It is far from true, i'm always liking and commenting on stuff of theirs via fb, or all of my family.



Something that has affected me: The entire family has done vacations without us (theme parks, recent cruises, so on) but I have tried to not let it ruin relationships.

I reached out to ask why and they stated they didn't think to invite me. I have always felt like the black sheep, there is some pain there, but I usually try to not over think that feeling.



C said me not attending the wedding was her ""last straw"". Which is odd, because T told me she was understanding about us not going. But perhaps there was some discussion without us. After C sent her message, I tried to explain why we happened to be at the zoo (which probably looked like a casual outing even if several weeks prior to the wedding), that I felt that 3-4 weeks was not ""short notice"" and that i'm sorry she felt that way about me. I mentioned how there was lack of any prior conversation to remove me from her life to ""save herself bad energy"". However that I held no hard feelings about her decision and then blocked her.

She is not a good person, and this has happened before. She refuses to take responsibility and is always blaming others. Once during DOFE me and her got mad at an injured teammate.

105,1g8al51,AITA for making a Christmas anti-list?,"I (33F) admit I am difficult to buy gifts for. I really don't want more things than I have, I have so much stuff and nowhere to put it as it is (a recent move really opened my eyes to this). Plus, I'm financially stable enough and have cheap enough hobbies that I can usually just buy myself something when I want it.

That brings us to a recent issue with my mother. She asked a couple weeks ago for everyone in the family to start our Christmas lists so she can get started on her Christmas shopping (yeah, she starts very early). This is all done on a google doc that's shared with the family, and then people will message around to talk about who is getting what so we're not accidentally buying the same thing for each other. Like an informal registry I guess.

I couldn't think of much I wanted. I asked for some tickets to sports games, silly and non-mass produced tchotchkes, scented candles, and gift cards to a few restaurants. While trying to come up with ideas for things, mostly I just kept dreading all the sorts of things I usually get for Christmas then have to find a place for. I decided to include a list of things not to buy me, figuring that might be as helpful as a list of things I do want. On the list I put things like ""fun"" socks, funko pops, anything I have to assemble aka ""Merry Christmas, I got you a chore you have to do now"", throw blankets, jewelry, throw pillows, decorations, etc.

I intended to go back and add more things I *do* want later, but the day after I made the anti-list my mom called asking why I did that and complaining that I never like the gifts she gives me. I have told her in the past I don't want these things and she'll remember for a year then buy me a pair of slipper socks the next which then join the four other pairs I already don't wear. I pointed this out and she complained about how hard it is to buy me gifts and that just getting me gift cards is boring. She said I'm just going to end up with a bunch of candles then complain about that next year. I told her that was just all I could think of in the moment and I'd add more stuff if I thought of it.

She thinks it's negative to have the anti-list and wants to delete it *but...* my brother and his wife have both made anti-lists now, so have an uncle and a cousin. My brother also joked about a secret anti-list for their kids to avoid getting terribly messy or noisy toys.

Others are split, some don't care, some people think it's helpful, others agree that it's negative and not in the Christmas spirit.

107,1g8a0lw,AITA My mum is struggling to let go,"AITA for not telling my parents about my constant comings and goings and visiting them less than I used to. 
Call this a mixture of a vent and an AITA post.
I (25F) have been living out of home for nearly 3 years now. My parents live 5+ hours away from me by car. I moved for my job which could not be done where my parents live.
When I first moved away most of my leave was used going back to visit them and my friends, with only the odd holiday away or weekend away to see friends in other location. Gradually, those visits have been less frequent as I have become more settled in the town that I live in which has meant less trips back to visit them. I also find talking on the phone/texting quite exhausting and don‚Äôt feel like I need that constant communication to know I am loved/valued by another person. In saying that my mum does text me A LOT and I usually reply daily if not every second day. I have never felt the need to reply to messages instantly.
Another important fact is that in the past year I also started dating someone, meaning my life had become more intertwined with theirs, I have gone on holidays away with them multiple times this year. This is my first serious relationship and the first serious relationship of any of my siblings or I. My parents have never been big on pushing relationships or talking about relationships in my life. 
In the past couple of weeks I have had a few heated discussions with them. One came off the back of a visit where my partner and I nearly broke up. Everything got resolved and we are happier and better than ever but my parents were present for the emotional rollercoaster of the few days, saw me sad and instantly made my partner the villain in the situation - one which I am happy to admit I made mistakes as well - one which is my partner never felt welcome when my parents were visiting or with me, and that they always felt like they would get in the way.
In a more recent conversation I was told that I was not respecting them because there were times I would fly away on holidays, have a 3-4 hour layover in my parents city and not tell them. This would happen on a work day but I was accused for being disrespectful for not telling them if they wanted to come and meet me at the airport or have coffee. 
There are more examples I can give, but for the sake of not extending the post any further I will leave it here. 
Essentially, I feel like I am in the right to live my life without always having to double check my decisions for their approval. I feel I have kept good contact with them, and in contrast they are constantly trying to keep in contact with me. They often try to force me to extend a weekend away with the excuse of ‚Äòusing leave‚Äô or ‚Äòusing sick leave‚Äô when there are aspects of my job that are timely and it is also a job which cannot be done remotely.

She has now accepted that I wasn't being malicious in not telling her about the savings and in light of us getting evicted is now on the same page as me and would like to use the savings to get on the property ladder soon.

A couple of days ago, I had a conversation with her regarding mortgages, and mentioned about getting a declaration of trust put in place so that the deposit money would be protected and returned to me should our relationship ever go sour, but this has now caused a heated 'discussion' in which she feels I'm being selfish, and that its not something she really wants to entertain.

As I earn alot more than her so I would still be paying the full mortgage cost, along with some bills and she would cover the food shop and maybe a couple of utility bills (basically the same as it has been with renting), but have said that after the deposit, the house would be 50/50 split.

113,1g88i2x,AITA for refusing to teach a kid how to swim?,"I (23f) go to a swimming pool once or twice a week. It's a way for me to do physical exercise and to take my mind off school or just life in general. 

The pool that I go to has two pools: one for fun and one for ""real"" swimming if you see what I mean. The ""real"" pool has two different sides, one where people swim seriously and one where people learn how to swim. I normally go to the ""serious"" part. You aren't supposed to stop in the serious one, or to go if you can't swim well because it's pretty deep (3-4 meters I think). 

Yesterday, I was swimming as I usually do, and at some point I start doing backstroke. At one point, I feel my hand hitting something, so I turn back to see what it was and I see a kid that was about 6 or 7. I apologize for hitting him because I didn't see him, and tell him that he's not supposed to stop in this lane because other people might hit him too. As I talk to him I notice that he isn't swimming really well and is struggling a lot. I decide to get out of the pool with him and look for his parents. 

After looking around the pool for a while I find his mother. At this pool, if you're accompanying a child you can get in for free if you don't swim, and that's what the mom did so she wasn't swimming and was waiting while looking on her phone. I told her that she should look after her son because it was pretty dangerous for him to be in such a deep pool when he couldn't swim very well and that he could get hit by swimmers. 

She looked at me a bit annoyed. She said ""it's okay he's just a kid"". I told her that I wasn't upset at him, and that I was just concerned for his safety. She told me that if I was so concerned, when I saw a child struggling to swim I could've helped him and taught him. I simply said that it wasn't my role, but she sort of insisted, said that she saw me swimming pretty often and asked that I teach her son. 

I told her that I wouldn't because 1. I'm not a swimming instructor, I have zero training for this 2. I don't want to be responsible for the boy's life, if anything happens it's on me and that's more pressure than I want 3. I'm not getting paid to do that and 4. I come here to relax, not teach kids. 

She told me that it wasn't nice that I wasn't helping her, because she couldn't teach her son (she can't swim) and I was a good swimmer so it wasn't difficult for me. I know that I could've helped, and maybe at least taught him the basics for like an hour, and a part of me thinks that I should've, but also I had my reasons for refusing.

I then noticed a small dog inside the car, so I stayed outside for 15-20 minutes to see if she would return quickly. 

After about 30 minutes, I noticed the dog panting pretty dramatically, so I called the humane society, and covered her windows with a towel to try and create shade (the sun was directly overhead, it was about 80¬∞, and her vehicle was black). 

The humane society informed us it'd be about an hour until they could respond, and told us if the dog appeared to be in major distress we should break the window. We waited and watched the dog for another 15 minutes, when the owner finally returned. 

I asked her ""Is this your truck?"" she replied ""yes"" and I said ""do you normally leave your dog in a hot car?""

She replied, dismissively, ""he's used to it, mind your business."" to which I replied ""you dumb bitch, there's no used to it in this situation, it's hot as fuck outside and he looked terrified the entire time you were gone.""

 I admit, there were some expletives thrown in her direction by every member of the shop (all of whom are dog owners who would NEVER consider similar behavior).

117,1g86yxe,AITA for giving my mother silent treatment after she threw away a gift from my girlfriend? ,"I (19 F) told my mom that I'm bisexual and have a girlfriend (19 F) over 2 years ago. She told me straight away it would be hard for her to accept it and that i ""shouldn't expect her to do it"" (my whole family is Christian and conservative btw). At first she would barely speak to me, but at some point it got quite ""normal"" again. However, from that point on it was only getting worse and worse. Now, we fight about it all the time, mostly because she keeps disrespecting my partner, literally forbidding her to come to our house, saying that she manipulated me into this relationship and that she's a ""bad influence"" (bc I started to defend my girlfriend and myself, which she considered disrespectful and said it's ""something she would never do to her own mother"" whatever that means). She even implied that I leave my girlfriend or ""give myself a chance to meet some guy"". She's extremely ashamed of me and my ""lifestyle"" and she's paranoid about anybody finding out about my relationship. She doesn't want to hear or see anything that even slightly reminds her that I have a girlfriend. 
But when I went to college things REALLY started to escalate. My mom got mad at me for decorating MY OWN apartment with pictures of me and my gf, implying I did it ""on purpose to make her upset"". That was just too much for me to take in at the time, so I stopped calling her and started avoiding her as much as I could, because i felt uncomfortable in her presence.
Now we can talk about the main issue of this post. Recently my mom did something even more disrespectful. She threw away a collection of paper flowers my gf has been giving me since we started dating (so for about 2.5 years). Obviously I got furious, to which she responded that they were ""ugly anyway"" and that there was no space in the bags to transport them to my new apartment, so she just threw them away. 
Now I'm not talking to her at all and pretending like she doesn't exist and my dad is upset with me. He said she didn't know I wanted to keep the flowers and that it's my fault for not calling her after leaving for college. Everyone acts like I'm overreacting bc of something irrelevant, but for me it was the most disrespectful thing my mom did to me (so far bc I expect there will be more).

I (19 F) told my mom that I'm bisexual and have a girlfriend (19 F) over 2 years ago. She told me straight away it would be hard for her to accept it and that i ""shouldn't expect her to do it"" (my whole family is Christian and conservative btw). At first she would barely speak to me, but at some point it got quite ""normal"" again. However, from that point on it was only getting worse and worse. Now, we fight about it all the time, mostly because she keeps disrespecting my partner, literally forbidding her to come to our house, saying that she manipulated me into this relationship and that she's a ""bad influence"" (bc I started to defend my girlfriend and myself, which she considered disrespectful and said it's ""something she would never do to her own mother"" whatever that means). She even implied that I leave my girlfriend or ""give myself a chance to meet some guy"". She's extremely ashamed of me and my ""lifestyle"" and she's paranoid about anybody finding out about my relationship. She doesn't want to hear or see anything that even slightly reminds her that I have a girlfriend. 
But when I went to college things REALLY started to escalate. My mom got mad at me for decorating MY OWN apartment with pictures of me and my gf, implying I did it ""on purpose to make her upset"". That was just too much for me to take in at the time, so I stopped calling her and started avoiding her as much as I could, because i felt uncomfortable in her presence.
Now we can talk about the main issue of this post. Recently my mom did something even more disrespectful. She threw away a collection of paper flowers my gf has been giving me since we started dating (so for about 2.5 years). Obviously I got furious, to which she responded that they were ""ugly anyway"" and that there was no space in the bags to transport them to my new apartment, so she just threw them away.

118,1g86wxd,AITA for not letting my inheritance be used for my step and half siblings when I'm not going to college?,"I (17M) won't be going to college after high school and instead I'm going to learn a trade. I feel like it works better for my skills and generally would be a better job for me. My mom isn't super happy about it but she knows college has been pushed on me for almost two years and my mind hasn't changed. So she's accepted that she won't change my mind and nobody will.

Here's why my post is here. My dad died when I was 6. When he was 9 my grandmom (his mom) died and it was due to medical negligence/malpractice and my grandpa, uncle and dad were awarded compensation, a huge amount too, for her death. Granddad split it between my dad and uncle. He was working and received social security benefits for them because grandmom died and he knew she'd want them to be taken care of above everything. When my dad realized he was sick he made sure that money would go to me, his only kid. He set it up in a trust and left my granddad and uncle in charge of it. The money is a lot. Like I could easy be debt free going to college with it and have some left over if I was smart about it. My mom knew about the money but cannot access it.

My mom has been married to her husband for 9 years. My parents were separated when dad died, btw. Her husband has a son who's a year younger than me and has a medical condition. My mom also has two kids with her husband/my half siblings.

Because of my stepbrother's medical condition and his mom not being in his life or his mom's family, they don't really have any savings for his college anymore (they had to spend it for some medical stuff) and my half siblings have nothing either.

My mom and her husband think that since I have the money and won't be using it for college, I should give it to my stepbrother and half siblings and let them pay it back if I insist but that I could also just give it to them as a way to help them with their futures and be a good brother.

I said no and I told them I wouldn't change my mind. Mom asked why and I said it's my inheritance from my dad. I could buy a house with it. I could protect my future with it. I could save it for my future kids. But I don't want to risk it not being paid back when it was dad's way of securing my future. She told me he'd want me to do this and I asked her if she really thinks he'd want the money he got from losing his mom to be used on random kids that aren't me. She told me they're not random to me so yes. She believes he'd want me to be a good brother. She told me I should really give it more consideration.

119,1g86owe,AITA for shushing him?,"I know this might seem silly but I‚Äôm 32F at loggerheads with my bf 33M over this.
A few nights ago we played the new ‚ÄúA Quiet Place‚Äù game together. In the game it has a feature in which you have the microphone on and if it detects sounds the monsters can hunt you. I was playing with the controller and my bf was telling me to do this and do that but he was talking very loudly so I shushed him in a playful way. 
The next day I was outside our house - we live on a very busy street - in the car about to leave when my boyfriend came outside to take a picture of something. He had only just woken up and was still just in his underwear. There were quite a few people around so I opened the car door and told him to put some trousers on. I only said this to him as he was in a vulnerable position to be outside somewhere fairly busy in his underwear. Granted he was only outside for less than a minute. When I said this he very aggressively shushed me, loudly enough that other people on the street saw and began to stare. He glared at me, went in and slammed the door. 
I said to him when I came home that I felt that the shush was quite disrespectful and I didn‚Äôt like being spoken to like that. He admitted he didn‚Äôt even hear what I‚Äôd said but could hear by the tone in which I‚Äôd said it that it was ‚Äúhen pecking‚Äù 
This isn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôs shushed me in this manner. 
I shushed him the night before during that game but I honestly believed it was in a playful way but he is saying that it is unjust that I should be upset at him shushing me when I had done it the night before.

120,1g86b8f,AITA for forcing my mom to let me drive my car?,"Two days ago I ran errands with my mom, and we took my car since my dad had theirs. (When we made plans a few days prior, I agreed to let her drive.) I had a headache and was experiencing some sensory overload. I decided to ride it out and wore dark sunglasses, noise cancelling ear plugs, and sensory friendly clothing. I took otc pain meds before I left my house.

I‚Äôm AuDHD (autistic and ADHD) and bec of that I have sensory issues/hypersensitivities. Being in pain takes my focus away from self-regulating sensory stuff. My mom‚Äôs diabetic but NOT autistic or ADHD. She was in a car accident 6 years ago, and had to be in the hospital for a day. Since then, she‚Äôs afraid to have others drive her. No, she doesn‚Äôt taken meds for anxiety. No, she isn‚Äôt in therapy for and has never been in therapy for anxiety. Idk why, but I don‚Äôt want to pry if she chooses not to involve me in her healing process.

My headache didn‚Äôt go away and I started having stomach problems. By the last stop, it was torture. I asked her to let me drive, and why. She refused. She said she‚Äôs afraid to have anyone else drive her since the accident. I asked what happens when someone else drives, and if she has panic attacks or something like that. She said no, she‚Äôs just afraid. 

I slumped down against the side of the car and said quietly I‚Äôd wait until I could drive. She started yelling that she wanted to go home, and I told her I did too so please switch seats with me. She said she was having low blood sugar, which I don‚Äôt believe bec 1. she ate lunch 30 minutes ago 2. she hadn‚Äôt checked her insulin pump since then 3. her pump warnings hadn‚Äôt gone off 4. I always keep emergency snacks/drinks in my car specifically for her, and she didn‚Äôt ask for any. Eventually I sat in the car with the door open, and she pulled out of the space thinking I‚Äôd give up and close it. I said ‚Äúthat‚Äôs illegal‚Äù and ‚Äústop it I can‚Äôt handle this‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not closing the door‚Äù. 

At the end of the row she stopped at the stop sign, and I quickly threw the car in park (gear shift in the middle), tapped the stop/start button and shut off the car (also in the middle), walked away so she couldn‚Äôt restart it, and sat down to do deep breathing. She was yelling the same things again. She couldn‚Äôt drive away since I had the keys in my pocket, and I always keep my keys on me no matter who drives my car since they have my house keys and such on them.

Here‚Äôs where I think I might have been TA. After a few mins I walked back to the car and said if she wouldn‚Äôt let me drive, I‚Äôd call someone about it. She was confused and said ‚Äúwho on earth is that‚Äù and I said ‚Äúwho do you think could legally compel you to let me drive my own car‚Äù. She looked confused, then shocked, and yelled ‚ÄúYOU WOULD CALL THE POLICE ON ME?!?!‚Äù I said yes, I‚Äôd call the non-emergency line.
