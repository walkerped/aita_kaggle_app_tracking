0,1g7va2s,AITA for cussing out the boy who confessed to liking me?,"Background info: This boy has been in my class for the past two years and he‚Äôs never said a single word to me, at least not to my face. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs even looked at me. He‚Äôs one of the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù boys who makes sports and being the ‚Äòclass clown‚Äô his whole personality. He‚Äôs super transphobic, homophobic, sexist, ableist, literally the whole damn list. 

So the other day, I was about to leave my class and suddenly he tapped my shoulder and I looked over, and he asked to talk in private. I said ‚Äúsure‚Äù and he found a spot and then basically just said ‚ÄúI like you‚Äù. Blank face, no emotion in his voice. I kind of looked around because like I said, he‚Äôs never spoken a single word to me. I saw his friends a little way away and figured he‚Äôs saying it as a prank and told him so. 

He denied it and I got angry at him and kind of just went off about how he‚Äôs a self-centred, egotistical prick who‚Äôs whole personality is based around sports and being the (unfunny) class clown that talks to all the popular girls at school. I‚Äôm not popular, I think I‚Äôm actually one of the weird kids. He basically just laughed it off then went over to his friends and hasn‚Äôt talked to me again. 

Edit: We‚Äôre both in our last couple years of high school. 

Second edit: I somehow forgot to mention the most important thing that I‚Äôm trans FTM, but I‚Äôm closeted so no one knows. That‚Äôs why the transphobia and such make me so annoyed.

1,1g7rm4s,AITA for not telling my friend the day that I got a new boyfriend?,"Alright this is an odd one.  Let's call the friend in question Zen.

So, I've known Zen for around 3 or 4 years, and she was a decent friend, but they tended to treat my other friend, Jae, like shit. That being said, Jae was quite friendly towards her, and he was part of my friend circle.
Me and Jae had feelings for each other and tried dating once during the first year, but quickly realized we weren't ready for that yet.

Zen mainly seemed to dislike Jae bc me and him bantered a lot, but none of it was super bad arguing, just little banter.

We grew a little bit apart, but we were still friends, just not as close. 

 And one day, Jae and I got back together. Now, due to the whole whirlwind of emotions, I didn't end up telling Zen for a couple weeks, and this is where I feel I may have been the asshole.

But when I told her, she threw a little bit of a fit. She was mad  I hadn't told her sooner, and kept treating it like Jae was some horrible monster. She kept complaining about how me and him ""fought"" and how he constantly misgendered me, etc.

(I hadn't come out to her as Genderfluid yet, but for a while, Jae had struggled when I thought I was transgender. It's been a journey, but Jae was doing his best to at least use they/them when referring to me. He was also brought up as a Methodist in an odd family, no offense intended, where he was raised thinking that sort of thing was wrong.)

She ended up saying that she would ""feel better"" if I had told her the day it happened, which wasn't an option at the time.
She also insulted him in dms when he tried to talk to her about it, and then directly called me some unpleasant things in his dms. 

He blocked her, and I cut her off, keeping one chat open in case there was an emergency with one of our mutuals. She forced one of our other friends, let's call him Dean, to get involved, but he told me he didn't wanna be involved and he would be leaving it be, so me and her could work it out however we saw fit.

Since then, she has tried to refriend me and ""work things out"" three times, not quite understanding no matter how I say it that I don't wanna be involved with her anymore.

We broke up and I'm with someone else now, but we ended on semi good terms and he never treated me badly. I don't know how much of this will make sense because it's late at night and I'm still learning how to type with long nails, but I was curious, AITA?",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-10-20,"AITA for not telling my friend the day that I got a new boyfriend?

2,1g7naon,AITA for hanging up on my mom," I'm (NB17) a college freshman that is going through a bout of stress in my first semester. My mom (56F) and I call/ft once or twice a week, but sometimes I do something that makes her upset. I feel very often that whenever I state my honest opinion about something that she immediately shuts me down or gets combative. She is also under a lot of stress, so I try to be sympathetic. Today, I called her to just talk in general (how her friends are, what work I'm doing for my classes, etc). She was talking about how one of her friends said that a movie I like was bad and an actress in it was a bad actress. I scoffed and said that that opinion was bullshit, trying to be funny, which made my mom a bit upset. We have very opposing senses of humor, and I try to make her laugh a lot, but it often falls flat. My mom then got even more upset at me when I realized I forgot which friend she was talking about (she has several friends of similar names). She then brought up the fact that I had apparently also come out to this person in order to jog my memory, which did not work. 

Now, this apparently happened all the way back when I was in middle school, and I had no recollection of it. I remember being very afraid to tell my mom I was queer/a lesbian at that time(I came out as nonbinary about 2 years later). My mom is still bitter about the fact that I told a lot of people I was queer before her, which I've tried to explain to her doesn't really matter because it's my information that I get to tell whoever I want, on principle. I don't remember a lot of middle school, or coming out (might've repressed it, idk, I also have a poor memory in general). 

I started panicking because she was getting upset with me for not remembering things. I started crying and bleeding from my nose (I get bloody noses when I'm stressed out, has happened since I was a child). I wasn't in good frame of mind and I honestly couldn't handle her looking at me, so I shakily hung up on her without saying goodbye or telling her I couldn't continue the call. 

She is very angry at me for doing this, even though I tried to explain that it was what I felt was best for me in that moment to handle the stress. When I am upset, I get very vicious and lash out, and I've gotten a lot better over the years at controlling myself, but I often avoid conflict when it's at a high point so that whoever I'm fighting/angry with and I can talk it out after we've assessed the situation a bit more. 

She is calling me disrespectful and bratty for hanging up on her abruptly. I don't feel its my responsibility to make her feel respected when I'm in obvious distress and panic mode. I know it was kind of a shitty move on my part to hang up, but she doesn't seem to understand or accept why I did what I did. She's always been very proper, and refuses to see how disrespect is subjective.
