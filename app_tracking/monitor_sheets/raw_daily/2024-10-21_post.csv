0,1g8p6s2,AITA for calling people who haven't done anything to me bullies?,"This might be a silly problem, but I wanted to ask about it, sorry for my english, is not my first language, I'm using fake names. I (17, F) recently started college, I have a group of friends, and within that group, I have a best friend named Gabby (18, F). Gabby made another group of friends (consisting of two girls and one guy) and every now and then, she invites me (just me) to spend time with them. They’re smart and fun, so I enjoy spending time with them, but I feel a bit bad about excluding the rest of our original group. I feel like Gabby spends more time with that group than with us, especially because the guy she likes is there.

Recently, we tried to go to a music show with our group of friends, but no one confirmed anything. Gabby was frustrated about that, so when the other group invited both of us to the same show, Gabby accepted immediately. This wouldn’t be a problem if it weren’t for the fact that in our group, we have a friend named Jess (17,F). Jess went to the same school as the two girls from Gabby's group of friends. They made some rude comments to Jess about her way of dressing, to Jess best friend for being non-binary, and to another girl for being from a lower-middle-class background. This makes Jess dislike them, but she told us she won't say anything because she feels that whatever happened between them shouldn’t be a reason to limit our friendships. I know the girls, I like them, and I think they’re funny, but I can definitely see them bullying others for petty reasons like that (they’ve made some gross comments about trans people and indigenous people that were very weird, like calling indigenous dirty and saying ""I'm gonna start asking about sex because a really don't care if you think you're a woman while having something hanging"" My country is pretty traditional so I'm used to hear that stuff but still, they are young, they have no reason to be that intolerant), I know that sounds awful (it is) but is very common in here, they are actually some of the least intolerant in our class.

I told Gabby that I didn’t want to go to the show with them because I thought it was disrespectful to Jess to go out with her bullies on a trip that was originally planned with her. Gabby got mad at me, saying she was tired of us never being able to go out with our group, and that it was rude to call them bullies because they’ve never done anything to me, she said I was taking it personally because I'm bi, so I am overly sensitive about the community, to be fair Gabby hasn't heard some comments, so even when I tell her it doesn't sound that offensive. Maybe I'm being unnecessarily mean? AITA?",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-10-21,"AITA for calling people who haven't done anything to me bullies?

1,1g8kmub,"AITA for telling my mother ""now you know how it feels""?","My mother & nan have always had a habit of being unkind towards me and making fun of me, especially regarding behaviours that are common in autism which I am diagnosed with. They always make everything about how I’m autistic and then make fun of my autism traits. 

I’ve been told that I’ll never get into my dream university nor will I ever become a lawyer by both, the unkind commentary is more obvious when my nan is over. I’m non-binary and they will both get mad at me for politely correcting them after they misgender me or deadname me. They both regularly call themselves fat and constantly use *me* to project their insecurities saying “I wish I had your body”, etc as well as telling me I’ll look like them when I’m older, which has happened since I was a child. They also try to tell me that I should break up with my boyfriend because *they* don’t like him and want me to date my best friend instead but don’t mind my sister’s boyfriend who is very rude and disrespectful. 

I communicate with them that this makes me uncomfortable and I don’t like it but I get told to grow up and stop being childish. My stepdad has noticed it too as I asked him about it and he said he doesn’t like it. 

Well. Yesterday my nan was over, as she has been a lot since my grandfather's both passed in March/April this year. I mentioned how she’s here a lot and then I asked her if she liked a certain place as we’re going out in November to celebrate my book’s release. She said no and I made a joke about how she wouldn’t be able to come then. My mother yelled at me for being mean but I said I wasn’t being mean. She said I was being mean even if I thought I was joking. I’d usually walk away when this happens because I don’t like drama but I’ve been really stressed for a few days so instead of doing that I said “well at least now you know how it feels.” 

I did leave after I said that. My mother seemed pissed for the rest of the day and whenever I tried to talk to her she was really rude. I couldn’t really talk to my stepdad about it due to my mother being around. I do intend on going no contact but I would like to get a stable job so I can afford my own house first and being autistic and in college is making it difficult. 

AITA?
