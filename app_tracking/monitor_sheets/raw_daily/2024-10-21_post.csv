0,1g8p6s2,AITA for calling people who haven't done anything to me bullies?,"This might be a silly problem, but I wanted to ask about it, sorry for my english, is not my first language, I'm using fake names. I (17, F) recently started college, I have a group of friends, and within that group, I have a best friend named Gabby (18, F). Gabby made another group of friends (consisting of two girls and one guy) and every now and then, she invites me (just me) to spend time with them. They’re smart and fun, so I enjoy spending time with them, but I feel a bit bad about excluding the rest of our original group. I feel like Gabby spends more time with that group than with us, especially because the guy she likes is there.

Recently, we tried to go to a music show with our group of friends, but no one confirmed anything. Gabby was frustrated about that, so when the other group invited both of us to the same show, Gabby accepted immediately. This wouldn’t be a problem if it weren’t for the fact that in our group, we have a friend named Jess (17,F). Jess went to the same school as the two girls from Gabby's group of friends. They made some rude comments to Jess about her way of dressing, to Jess best friend for being non-binary, and to another girl for being from a lower-middle-class background. This makes Jess dislike them, but she told us she won't say anything because she feels that whatever happened between them shouldn’t be a reason to limit our friendships. I know the girls, I like them, and I think they’re funny, but I can definitely see them bullying others for petty reasons like that (they’ve made some gross comments about trans people and indigenous people that were very weird, like calling indigenous dirty and saying ""I'm gonna start asking about sex because a really don't care if you think you're a woman while having something hanging"" My country is pretty traditional so I'm used to hear that stuff but still, they are young, they have no reason to be that intolerant), I know that sounds awful (it is) but is very common in here, they are actually some of the least intolerant in our class.

I told Gabby that I didn’t want to go to the show with them because I thought it was disrespectful to Jess to go out with her bullies on a trip that was originally planned with her. Gabby got mad at me, saying she was tired of us never being able to go out with our group, and that it was rude to call them bullies because they’ve never done anything to me, she said I was taking it personally because I'm bi, so I am overly sensitive about the community, to be fair Gabby hasn't heard some comments, so even when I tell her it doesn't sound that offensive.

1,1g8kmub,"AITA for telling my mother ""now you know how it feels""?","My mother & nan have always had a habit of being unkind towards me and making fun of me, especially regarding behaviours that are common in autism which I am diagnosed with. They always make everything about how I’m autistic and then make fun of my autism traits. 

I’ve been told that I’ll never get into my dream university nor will I ever become a lawyer by both, the unkind commentary is more obvious when my nan is over. I’m non-binary and they will both get mad at me for politely correcting them after they misgender me or deadname me. They both regularly call themselves fat and constantly use *me* to project their insecurities saying “I wish I had your body”, etc as well as telling me I’ll look like them when I’m older, which has happened since I was a child. They also try to tell me that I should break up with my boyfriend because *they* don’t like him and want me to date my best friend instead but don’t mind my sister’s boyfriend who is very rude and disrespectful. 

I communicate with them that this makes me uncomfortable and I don’t like it but I get told to grow up and stop being childish. My stepdad has noticed it too as I asked him about it and he said he doesn’t like it. 

Well. Yesterday my nan was over, as she has been a lot since my grandfather's both passed in March/April this year. I mentioned how she’s here a lot and then I asked her if she liked a certain place as we’re going out in November to celebrate my book’s release. She said no and I made a joke about how she wouldn’t be able to come then. My mother yelled at me for being mean but I said I wasn’t being mean. She said I was being mean even if I thought I was joking. I’d usually walk away when this happens because I don’t like drama but I’ve been really stressed for a few days so instead of doing that I said “well at least now you know how it feels.” 

I did leave after I said that. My mother seemed pissed for the rest of the day and whenever I tried to talk to her she was really rude. I couldn’t really talk to my stepdad about it due to my mother being around. I do intend on going no contact but I would like to get a stable job so I can afford my own house first and being autistic and in college is making it difficult.

I (19, non-binary) and my boyfriend (21, male) are in a long-distance relationship, which usually works for us. But recently, I’ve been having really bad nightmares, I’ve had similar nightmares for years, but these are about my exes and older friends acting inappropriately and have been happening more frequently than normal. I don’t like these dreams at all. The worst one involved my ex threatening me, and the dream happened while I was at my boyfriend’s house. This left me feeling really ashamed and has triggered panic attacks. I feel like I should tell my boyfriend since my ex is in these dreams, and it feels like I’m cheating in a way, even though I know it’s not my fault.
I’ve been on edge since then and plan to talk to my therapist about it, because I need to tell someone, but I’m unsure if I should tell my boyfriend. He knows about my panic attacks and tries to help, but he doesn’t usually ask about the reason unless I bring it up.
Just to be sure people understand, i don't feel bad for the dream being about cheating, But more the not wanting to have the inappropriate actions in them. I don't want to be a burden to my partner and I don't know how this emotionally works for me or him.

5,1g8xvel,AITA for snapping at  my gf that just because I let my sister cook for me doesn’t mean i enslaved her,"My (24m) sister (17f) loves cooking and baking. Ever since she was little she has taken it upon herself to make sure that everyone eats 3 good meals a day and that there’s always something to snack on and deserts. Basically anything that has to do with food.

2 days ago my girlfriend came over (I live with my parents and sister) and when my sister came back from school and asked if we want her to make us food as well (she was already going to make herself some since in our country there’s no school lunch so she was hungry) I said yes since I was starting to get hungry. We had a talk for a few minutes about what she should make and she went to make the food.

My gf kept giving me looks and being passive aggressive about how I’m letting my sister cook for me, and how I’m never going to be able to take care of myself.

She then went on a whole speech about how when we start living together she expect me to cook as well and do house chores, that she’s not going to let me “inslave” her like I did my sister.

I was mad, My parents work a lot so me and my sister are responsible for all house chores (that’s one of the reasons that I still live with my parents and that I went to a close by college that let me live at home, I don’t want all of the responsibilities to fall only on my sister) we both know how to do everything you need in the house, I know how to cook just fine and I help my sister sometimes, but she likes her time in the kitchen, she says it brings her peace and I’m not going to interfere with that.

I told my gf all of that in an admittedly loud and angry voice, and that considering we’ve only been dating for 4 months I don’t think she can talk about what will happen when we live together, especially considering that I’m not sure anymore that I want to be someone who has just met my sister for the first time and is now sure that she’s enslave from one conversation.

I picked up friend 1 at their house and picked up friend 2 on the way. 


We were all excited to go! It was our first time there. 


I paid for a photo op with Matthew Lillard which was $120. Friend one also paid for a photo op with him. Friend 2 did not. I also paid for friend 2's ticket which was $40 and some change. I also paid for the hotel room which was $330 for one night. Friend one gave me $75 which was originally the amount that was their portion for another hotel room that ended up being more expensive. I told them they could just pay me the $75 and not to worry about it. Friend 2 did not help pay for the hotel room, nor did they offer gas money like they said they would the week before. 


Friend 1 and 2 were talking and friend 1 told friend 2 they also had their own ticket for Matthew Lillard. I didn't hear this convo. 



Our session was at 9:30(mine) and 9:45(friend 1) and friend 2 didn't have a session so they would be left alone while we did our photo op. This took an hour or so for us to get through the line and wait, they were running behind. 


When we came out of the photo op, friend 2 was pissed off and not talking to us. She wouldn't engage in conversation and was generally pissed off/upset. I asked what was wrong and they snapped at me saying they had been left alone for an hour and they have anxiety. I apologized and left her alone. 



The next morning she seemed fine at first, but she then told me she didn't know i didn't want her in the picture. I told her I was sorry and we got in the car. She didn't eat breakfast and sat in the car while we had breakfast. 



I dropped her off at her vehicle and she hasn't messaged me since. 



Friend 2 has kids, friend 1 and I do not. I have a lot of extra money because I have a side gig that I work really hard on (no it's not an MLM lol) so I was able to afford this trip. Friend 2 makes $5 less than i do an hour. Friend 1 makes about the same as I do. Friend 2 knew the night I bought their ticket that I also bought the photo op so it wasn't a secret or anything.

The next morning she seemed fine at first, but she then told me she didn't know i didn't want her in the picture. I told her I was sorry and we got in the car. She didn't eat breakfast and sat in the car while we had breakfast. 



I dropped her off at her vehicle and she hasn't messaged me since. 



Friend 2 has kids, friend 1 and I do not. I have a lot of extra money because I have a side gig that I work really hard on (no it's not an MLM lol) so I was able to afford this trip. Friend 2 makes $5 less than i do an hour. Friend 1 makes about the same as I do. Friend 2 knew the night I bought their ticket that I also bought the photo op so it wasn't a secret or anything. 



AITA here? I don't think so, but I'm not so sure.

7,1g8xtnh,AITA for making a new guy friend in my class while being in a relationship ,"In my class we have a year long project where we much choose a theme and investigate it. Earlier when I was initially shared my theme with my teacher, another dude walked by and said we had the same theme. My teacher then said it would be cool if we worked together and shared eachothers ideas. Yesterday, the same dude came up to me and asked if he could interview me about our investigation search. We sat down and he asked me many questions and I answered them. Since our theme revolved around mental health we shared our own personally experiences and we talked about it and he ranted to me about his experiences. Overall we had a good conversation occasionally side tracking. 

I don’t have any interest in this guy in any romantic way I am always loyal to my boyfriend and I never have planned on changing that. I don’t have many friends so someone making a conversation with me did make me excited in a way but again not in a romantic way. After we were done the bell rung and he asked if I Had instagram where I wrote it down for him on his phone. I didn’t think it thru and never assumed it would be in any way. I just assumed it would be a friend type of way or to keep in touch for our project or things like that never to actually get to be romantically involved. The guy didn’t seem to have that same idea as well and I have highlights of my boyfriend in my instagram. After I was done I went to tell my boyfriend what happened where he became extremely upset. Now I feel terrible I was excited about possibly having a new friend but I don’t know if I’m wrong.

9,1g8xrka,AITA for telling my mom that I’d rather raise my daughter in a household like my dad’s and not like hers? ,"My husband (23m) and I (23f) had a baby back in April and both of our mothers haven’t been the best towards us. During my pregnancy everything was fine but after the baby came is when the real drama happened. We were in labor and delivery for 3 days and then got sent back after one night to stay in the NICU for another two days. We were planning on staying with her for a week after delivering our baby.(she lives with her drunk ex husband.) During the stay at the NICU we decided it was best for our daughter if we just went to my dad where we are currently living. We were both extremely exhausted and my husband had just started a new job. When we had told my mother about this it had started a huge fight and she was telling my younger sister (10) that we didn’t love her, didn’t want to have anything to do with her and had even gotten physically with me a few days postpartum. So we didn’t talk for a while. 
Fast forward 5 months. My mother had moved cities and we kinda talked things out and things were okay for a few days then we ended fighting again because she said that she wished she could have a relationship with her granddaughter and couldn’t ever get lost time back with her. I had told her that was because of her own actions. She then told me that she forgave me for what I did wrong but I haven’t forgiven her. I asked her what she thought I did wrong and she couldn’t give me an answer. another few days goes by and I messaged her this long paragraph basically saying that if she wants a relationship with my child then she need to put the effort into seeing her and that she needs to be able to talk things out with me instead of running away. After that I told her I’m sorry if it seems like I’m choosing my dad over you but I’d rather her grow up in a household like his rather than a household like yours. 
My dad has been a pastor for basically my whole life and the environment, the support and the stability is phenomenal. 
The only problems I had with my dad was when I was a teenager and I just wasn’t listening. He always pushed me to do better and I just rebelled a lot. 
The problem with my mom’s environment is that she doesn’t care. She spent most of her days on her computer. She has a hard time spending money wisely and complains that she’s broke. She would bring random men to the house a lot and has had a lot more weddings than a normal person. Couldn’t stay in one home for longer than what seemed like a few months and had even pushed me to move to another state with my abuser. 
So when she asked me what I meant about not wanting to bring my daughter up in her kind of household I told her those things and she said that I was dead to her and that was that.

Of course, I told her I did because that’s what good parents do. I sent him a message and received no reply. Hell my son even took it upon himself to call that number multiple times.

12,1g8xp2m,AITA - I want to exchange my engagement ring,"My fiancé proposed waaayy early into our relationship, less than a year in. He bought a ring and everything. When he proposed, I didn’t see it coming, but I was honest about how I felt. I told him I wasn’t ready yet, but I did see us heading in that direction but it was just too soon. He understood, and we stayed together. Now, our love has grown into a strong, unbreakable bond. I love him so much, and I communicate that to him everyday. I couldn’t be happier. I now feel ready to get married, we’ve told our families and we’re moving forward with our plans. 

When it comes to the ring, it’s just not my style at all. This is the most important piece of jewelry I’ll ever wear, and I feel like it should be representative of us, of me. I feel like he got it before really getting to know me entirely, my culture, etc. I always envisioned a discussion with my future partner about my ring, that I’d have a chance to explore and see what rings I’d like, etc (I never really thought about engagement rings before I met my partner, it was always a future distant thing) but I just don’t feel like this is my ring. He picked it out with the recommendation of the ring salesman who didn’t know me at all. 

I’ve told him this, and that I’m grateful that he took the time to pick this out and everything, and he understood where I’m coming from, and he said as long as I’m happy, that’s what matters. He’s not tied to that ring at all, he didn’t know anything about engagement rings either until now. So we’re now trying to sell the ring to buy a new one.

The first 1.5 years were just fun. We did a lot together and we regularly meet up, even though we live further away from each other.

I usually help organize our parties and such.
Which i happily do. But lately I have noticed that things have been different.

For context, everyone calls me often. Either for fun chats or to share (complain) about life. As a friend and people pleaser, I let them. I also like being in contact with them. But I noticed lately that I am being left out during our outings. Mainly during music events. I am newly diagnosed with ADHD, so I can be a bit impulsive and I seem to always have fun. Which usually is true. But some of my friends also called me to much, which hurts. (Read ADHD talkative)

This summer we went to a music event. Everyone just sat around, chatted with each other and I was just sort of there. So I spoke up. I admit I wasn’t nice in the moment, mostly by being very passive aggressive. Read “oh you noticed i wasn’t there?” Which admittedly wasn’t nice. Which I apologized for. I have to add, i was left alone most of the time because they sat down to talk with each other.

But I did tell them that it is not okay to just leave for 4 hours, or to not include someone in your conversations. This became a discussion about group dynamics and that not everyone will be in the spotlight all the time. Which is true, but not the same as leaving someone all by themself. I explained beforehand this would be my first festival while on ADHD medication and I would need some support.

Afterwards some friends told me to just not take them and others just straight up said, “well you talk with anyone, you can manage.” They even noticed I wasn’t myself, but told me they just wanted to enjoy the day and let me be.

I forgave them after some difficult considerations. With some of them being supportive and others just straight up angry for bringing it up.

14,1g8x6u6,AITA for not invite his gf?,"A week ago, I invited my friend and his parents to a family reunion cause we’re close to them and my mom asked me to invite them. My friend has a new girlfriend and who is the girl he cheated on his ex, I don’t want to have a deeper relationship with her cause I know the way he acts and I don’t want to develop another friendship with a girl I know he’s going to leave (sooner or later). We were at the car and I thought he was leaving this girl at her home and I told him that that e was missing that part. He told me “she’s coming” and I was like “oh, okay” I didn’t want to be rude so I just accepted even if I was uncomfortable with the idea of having her around my family (they met her ex and she close to them too until they break up). As soon as we were with his mother he text me “If you don’t want her to be here, we’re leaving” and I responded “I just told you that I didn’t know about it but it’s okay” He wrote several times that “he told me the night before” but I never heard anything about that so I replied that I never heard that. Then, he just gave me the car key and said “You can go with them (his parents), we’re leaving” and took a taxi. His excuse was that he doesn’t tolerate anyone’s bad attitude but I was literally like ???? cause I didn’t know he wanted to bring this girl with us.

My friend has a new girlfriend and who is the girl he cheated on his ex, I don’t want to have a deeper relationship with her cause I know the way he acts and I don’t want to develop another friendship with a girl I know he’s going to leave (sooner or later). We were at the car and I thought he was leaving this girl at her home and I told him that that e was missing that part. He told me “she’s coming” and I was like “oh, okay” I didn’t want to be rude so I just accepted even if I was uncomfortable with the idea of having her around my family (they met her ex and she close to them too until they break up). As soon as we were with his mother he text me “If you don’t want her to be here, we’re leaving” and I responded “I just told you that I didn’t know about it but it’s okay” He wrote several times that “he told me the night before” but I never heard anything about that so I replied that I never heard that. Then, he just gave me the car key and said “You can go with them (his parents), we’re leaving” and took a taxi. His excuse was that he doesn’t tolerate anyone’s bad attitude but I was literally like ???? cause I didn’t know he wanted to bring this girl with us.

15,1g8x3f7,AITA For doing something fun for my son's birthday without my husband,"My husband (39M) and I (41F) have a son who turns 5 next week.  We are having 2 separate bday parties for him this weekend.  Saturday we are having close friends and family over to our house, and on Sunday we are having a smaller party at a park with his friends from daycare.  It's been a lot of work getting everything ready for both parties.  

I am also really busy at work.  I have an interview for a big promotion coming up next Monday (which happens to be our son's actual bday).  Between all of that and the normal day-to-day stuff, I'm exhausted.  I decided to take next Monday off of work.  I figured I would use the morning for final interview prep, have my interview before lunch, then pick up my son early from daycare and do something fun together for his bday.  

Last night, I told my husband about this plan and he got kind of upset with me.  He asked me why I didn't talk to him about this before making a decision.  I told him that with all the stuff we have going on, I wanted to take some time for myself to prepare for the interview and thought that doing something fun for our son's birthday would make it extra special for him. 

My husband was upset because he felt like me doing something fun for our son's birthday without him will make our son think that I care more about his birthday than my husband.  I told him that he is being dramatic and that he is welcome to take off work and join us.  

He told me that if I had talked to him beforehand then he would have reminded me that he has clients in town all next week to close a big deal.  He said he's told me about this numerous times and that I've been so preoccupied with my own stuff that I don't even care to think that sometimes he has things going on, too.  This turned into an argument about me not making my husband feel like a priority.

I will admit that I have been very focused on my own job recently.  The promotion is opening up because my boss retired last month and my team has been scrambling since then.  So, yes, I have been very busy with my own stuff in addition to planning 2 bday parties.  

My husband then got mad at me for insinuating that he hasn't helped with any of the party planning, which again, isn't true.  He has done a lot and I'm grateful for that.  But his job is so far off my radar right now with everything else I have going on.  

I just wanted to do something fun with our son to not only make his birthday special, but to also give myself a reminder of what is most important in life.  My husband told me that this is just another thing that makes him feel like he is not a priority to me.  I told him that isn't true at all, I've just been very busy.  He told me that actions speak louder than words and I'm making it clear where he stands.

I told him that he is welcome to join us if he can.  Or that he can take our son out of daycare whenever he wants to do something fun just the two of them.

But I (17m) have been raised by my grandparents since birth and do not recognize their son or his wife as my parents. Biological parents if I have to be honest about it but my parents are my grandparents to me. But I call them both grandparents and parents depending on the situation.

My grandparents are my favorite people though and I'm SO glad they raised me. They were amazing grandparents turned parents again.

The extended family didn't see them often either even though my biological parents really tried to act like it was all one big family around them again.

Behind the hedge some nuisance tress had self seeded years ago as they’re quite established and by neighbours own words the previous owners of our house paid for someone to maintain these trees. 

Last year this neighbour asked us to cut back the trees my husband did. I told my husband he should have told the neighbours they had every right to cut the branches and maintain his side. This year the branches sprouted again and the neighbour txt my husband. My husband didn’t reply as his brother was getting married and he was very busy getting organised and doing his best man duties. The neighbour continued to txt and sent a total of 5 messages. On his way out yesterday my husband said “he txt again”. So while my two toddlers under 2 were napping my mother came over to sit in our house and I went in and cut the tree branches on his side. I left the branches piled neatly in the rear of his garden behind huge trees that he owns. 

My point of view is that they are his branches so I’m not taking them. Neighbour gave me an angry phone call today saying he wanted the branches removed that I cut and that I entered his property illegally. I told him I entered when it was convenient to me with small children and that I only did so because he continued to txt us and that by my understanding he wanted it done urgently. I told him the branches were overhanging on his side and I would not be removing them. He went on again about me illegally entering his garden and I apologised for not contacting him but like I said I took the opportunity when I had it to get the job done. I explained I killed the trees from the base at our side and so he should not have issues with them again. I explained two of the trees are rooted on his side and I did not kill these. He then said I had no right to cut those branches and I explained that it was hard to tell where they were growing from until trimmed. The base of the trees I killed on our side I left on our side and the branches that were overhanging and fell into his side when I cut I left on his side. 

He wants all branches removed, I don’t want to remove them because I feel we shouldn’t have had to cut them in the first place. He mentioned me entering illegally about 20 times on the call to intimidate me to remove the cut offs, and I left the phone call with “they’re your branches, as they were overhanging on your side and I’m not removing them” he left with it “so you entered my property illegally and won’t take what you cut, that’s fine I’ll be calling to house soon and this won’t be the end” I then said “well you have my number” speak to you then.

I personally have no relationship with his grandpa but I have felt the pain of losing a grandparent. In fact, all of my grandparents have left, so I understand how sad it must be (it’s his first time losing a grandparent).

21,1g8vzwg,AITA for making a big deal out of my niece’s graduation? ,"
My gf and I come from very different families. My parents celebrated everything I do, yes even the really small things like an A on a test even if I didn’t do well in the class. Her parents did not celebrate anything of hers. She said the biggest celebration she got was her parents telling her she did “not bad” after she graduated with her masters and bought her some pastries. Apparently no celebration after her undergrad because that was the bare minimum. Its caused to some issues between us.

Specifically that I like to have a birthday month and she just rolls her eyes at it. She will have a birthday meal with me but she refuses to acknowledge my birthday after the date. At my house growing up the birthday person was given special treatment their entire month. I try to celebrate her birthday but apart from a special meal she hates when anyone acknowledges her birthday. 

My niece has ADHD and got pregnant by her bf in high school which caused a lot of drama. As such she didn’t graduate on time with a diploma and only got certificate. My brother and sister feeling really sorry for her gave her a big high school graduation celebration. They got a ballon arch outside their house and invited over 50 people. She came with to meet my parents and was shocked at the money being spent and in her eyes wasted celebrating a high school graduation which she says is basically expected. I was annoyed when she said these things but kept my mouth shut because she was also meeting my parents. 

That was a year ago and my niece upgraded for a year and doing summer to graduate with a full high school diploma. I’m planning to attend again. I know she is embarrassed by needing an extra year but I’m proud of her never the less. The problem is my parents are on vacation now and the fight tickets went up $500 so it’s now very expensive. I had to put it on credit card but I should be able to pay it off. 

But I still plan to attend and asked my gf to come along. She flat out said no and said I shouldn’t as well because it’s too expensive and I already went to her graduation last year. I explained the difference and she said there wasn’t a difference only a technicality and there’s no reason to go. I got mad and said it was to make my niece feel supported. She told me my niece doesn’t need 2 graduation parties and my brother and SIL are only doing it to make her feel better about not graduating with a diploma on time but she already knows she didn’t and this won’t make her feel better about it. 

I got really mad and said yelled that she shouldn’t downplay other people achievements and people like to celebrate small things and she shouldn’t discount it because her family wouldn’t acknowledge anything she does.

",Asshole,2024-10-21,"AITA for making a big deal out of my niece’s graduation?  
My gf and I come from very different families. My parents celebrated everything I do, yes even the really small things like an A on a test even if I didn’t do well in the class. Her parents did not celebrate anything of hers. She said the biggest celebration she got was her parents telling her she did “not bad” after she graduated with her masters and bought her some pastries. Apparently no celebration after her undergrad because that was the bare minimum. Its caused to some issues between us.

Specifically that I like to have a birthday month and she just rolls her eyes at it. She will have a birthday meal with me but she refuses to acknowledge my birthday after the date. At my house growing up the birthday person was given special treatment their entire month. I try to celebrate her birthday but apart from a special meal she hates when anyone acknowledges her birthday. 

My niece has ADHD and got pregnant by her bf in high school which caused a lot of drama. As such she didn’t graduate on time with a diploma and only got certificate. My brother and sister feeling really sorry for her gave her a big high school graduation celebration. They got a ballon arch outside their house and invited over 50 people. She came with to meet my parents and was shocked at the money being spent and in her eyes wasted celebrating a high school graduation which she says is basically expected. I was annoyed when she said these things but kept my mouth shut because she was also meeting my parents.

22,1g8vsrr,AITA for not waking up my roommate?,"I, 19M, am a freshman in college. My roommate, 18M, and I met at an admissions tour before we both got accepted to the college of our choice and we decided that if we got in that we would room together. We have a lot in common including what times we go to bed and wake up, how clean we like the room, temperatures, etc. He is overall a very respectful roommate who always asks me before having friends over and whenever he wants to change something about the room.

The biggest issue I have is our sensitivity to noise. I wake up at the slightest of sounds (background: my cat likes to throw up at the edge of my bed and I gained the ability to wake up quickly to get him off before he ruined my sheets) and my roommate can sleep through anything. Most days of the week his alarm is set for 7am or 7:30. Some days this isn’t an issue for me because I have my alarm also set for 7am, but other days I want to sleep in because I don’t have classes until later.

I am my roommates alarm. I would like to preface by saying he doesn’t do it on purpose, but unless I wake up to his alarm and wake him up he doesn’t get up and the alarm rings for hours. This becomes a struggle on days I want to sleep in, but it doesn’t bother me so much because I can just go to sleep again after. Only issue is: once my roommate is up, he is loud. I am understanding that I wake up to anything and that is on me. If he was trying to stay quiet I wouldn’t have an issue. The thing is: he doesn’t. He slams doors, rummages through boxes, and most times rearranges his entire wardrobe in the mornings by throwing things out, playing music, and organizing. I have asked him on numerous occasions to please save it for times when we are both awake but he refuses to. I am very quiet when I get up as to not wake him up and I feel like my effort isn’t reciprocated.

Some times he listens and doesn’t do that in the morning, however his new solution is to do it at midnight when we both should be in bed and I am trying to sleep. We both agreed on a time we would like to sleep before we became roommates but he says that college life has thrown off his sleep schedule, and now he just has a lot of energy at night.

I was telling all of this to another friend and she recommended that I stop waking my roommate up. In the mornings I should get up and turn off his alarm, but continue about my day. She also recommended I start being as loud as he is in the mornings, but I don’t usually like being loud in general so I didn’t do that.

However, I did start turning off his alarms. He has been waking up late and has missed his classes several times. He always asks if I woke him up, and I’m saying no. He is upset with me for not waking him up and turning off his alarm. To him, either I let the alarm ring until he wakes up or l turn it off and wake him up. Recently I came clean about what I was doing to some friends and I received mixed responses. Some of them think I’m TA, while others think what I’m doing is reasonable.

25,1g8vlhi,AITA For Putting My Foot Down When My MIL Demanded I Take Down My Wedding Photos,"I 23f just married my 24m husband a few weeks ago. Due to our jobs we didn’t do a traditional wedding ceremony or have any family with us. 

My MIL fought us the whole time saying we should reconsider and have both of our parents come to attend. We didn’t want that. Because of our jobs my husband and i hadn’t seen each other in six months and just wanted to be married and be left alone for the one week we had together before he had to leave again. MIL eventually dropped it after my mother convinced her too, telling her we were still planning on having a large ceremony down the line and we didn’t see this as being anything important just paperwork. 

We did a small quick thing down in the gardens by the water in my city with my pastor. Everything went smoothly. 

a few days after my husband wanted to visit some friends of ours in the area. I had no problem with that because we didn’t know when the next time he would get to see them would be 

We asked our friends if they wouldn’t mind doing a backyard wedding shoot for us since they were the ones who did our engagement photos. They said absolutely so we went. My little nephew demanded he be in some photos and we all had a good time together. Our  friend said once he finished the editing he would send us the photos. They all came out great. When i received them i posted a few with the caption “Sharing some of the photos of our itty-bitty wedding shoot ps not our kid but our nephew and he demanded being in some photos so who could say no to the little guy” and i thought nothing else of it as the congratulations came flooding in. 

Here’s where i may be the A-hole the following day as i was getting off of work my husband called and asked if i had posted the photos i said yes and he asked about the one with my nephew i said yes again and in a huff my husband said ok and hung up. 

i should state that my normal working hours consisted of close to 14-15 hour shifts sometimes with out eating because i forget depending on the day so by the end im usually exhausted and not in the perfect people dealing mood.


i called my husband back to find out what was wrong he said MIL is demanding I take the photos down immediately saying now it looks like we did a wedding with some family and not others because of my caption. I lost it i told him i would be doing no such thing. I was tired of her trying to dictate our lives and that I was putting my foot down and I was not removing the photos for any reason. 

He apologized to me and understood where I was coming from but he could also see how his mom could be hurt too. I said i didn’t care it wasn’t my problem and she needed to get over it.  He said ok hung up with me to call his mom back. I then called my mom crying because I was so tired and frustrated and hungry and needed her opinion on if I was wrong for snapping. She told me no  and that I needed to have a discussion with my husband about setting boundaries for MIL when it come to our decisions. so am I the a-hole ? 


Update: some people are confused on the nephew part he is the son of the friends who took the photos we have been side by side with them since the kid was born and at one point we all live in the same little apartment he is nephew by friends not by blood. 


update2: both immediate families were fully aware of what we were doing both families insisted on having some kind of photos now since we were going to do everything traditional in a few years 


update 3 : because my husband and i have been so close with these friends for so long both side of our families were aware of our relationship to the child as well as there post previously calling him nephew. 

update 4: all photos were sent to both immediate families prior to the post being created

30,1g8v296,AITA for not greeting my mom when I came back from walking my dog?,"So I went outside to walk my dog and listen to a podcast. When I came back inside, I didn’t immediately greet my mom because I wanted to wait until my podcast ended. As I’m making myself a tea, she starts yelling, “OH HI MOM, OH HI MOM, OH HI MOM” over and over again. Then she calls me a rude piece of shit for not saying hi right away.

I tried to explain that I was going to say hi after my podcast finished, but before I could even get the words out, she starts screaming at me about how I’m a terrible son who never wants to talk to her.

Here’s the thing: every time we talk, it’s completely one-sided. She’ll go on and on about things she likes, but if I try to talk about something that interests me, she either changes the subject or blanks me. So it feels pretty pointless to have these “conversations.”

Anyway, I stayed super calm the whole time, but she just kept losing her mind. I’m starting to think she was mad that I wasn’t giving her a reaction, or maybe she just wants the validation of me saying “Oh hi, Mom” immediately? I don’t know, but the way she demands it just seems so egotistical to me.

She eventually stormed out with her boyfriend, probably slagging me off the whole way. The real issue is that I can’t even explain to her why I don’t feel like talking to her because she never lets me get a word in. So I called her a crybaby and walked off, and she completely lost her shit.

FYI my father work in special force hence he's always away so throughout my childhood I felt like I don't have a father. I do understand that it's his job. Recently he started to visit home frequently and would stay for a month or only a week it really depends on the situation. I am really jealous that my younger siblings have a good relationship with him. I'm really having a hard time expressing my self. Is there an explanation for this?

Now that I live far from my family because of college, I think my relationship with my father worsened more. I rarely chat my father except my mother (I can't think of any topic to start a convo). I felt like we're a stranger connected by blood.

This is hard.

I just wanted to have a great relationship with my father 'cause my mother explained that my father opened up to her that he thinks I only favor my mother and that I just saw him as a money provider? Wtf.

Also is there something wrong with me? I don't feel any connection to anyone, to be honest i view my own family as just some people I'm related nothing. I don't even miss them. (I thought that these people will die anyway so it's better to not be too connected with them or I'll hurt myself.)

35,1g8uei2,WIBTA if I sent an ex friend’s boyfriend a wedding invite?,"So me (25NB) and my fiancé “Mike” (32M) are set to get married in a couple years (the reason it’s so far off is to save enough money for the wedding we want, but I digress). We’re already coming up with our guest list, but we’re also taking our time with it, as there are a lot of factors involved.

One person we both want to invite is “Dean” (M30s). Dean is dating “Jen” (F20s). Mike was best friends with Dean and Jen for years before I even met Mike. When Mike and I started dating, I was introduced to Dean and Jen, and we all hit it off pretty well. Unfortunately, Jen and I had a falling out. Jen took it upon herself to lie to Mike about the situation and badmouth me, but Mike, being the reasonable and amazing guy he is, saw past her crap and cut Jen out, which in turn ended up somewhat cutting out Dean.

I say “somewhat” because despite the falling out we had with Jen, Dean is still super cool with us. We don’t talk or make plans to hang out, but when we happen to run into Dean and Jen at places we all had frequented together, Dean breaks off from Jen to greet us and catch up a bit. In short, we still consider him to be a solid guy and respect the hell out of him.

Mike was the first one who’d said he wants to invite Dean to our wedding, and when he gave his reasons, I didn’t disagree. Of course it would mean Jen would be his plus one (provided they’re still together by that point), which we don’t have a problem with, but this is where we’re stuck on the decision, because when the falling out with Jen happened, she took it upon herself to go around to our shared friend group and tell the same lies and badmouth me to them as well, whereas I only told maybe two or three people who I felt closest to in detail about everything and provided screenshots and proof of it all. Most of the friend group has stayed neutral, which I respect because I would never ask anyone to pick a side in a situation that has nothing to do with them, but a couple of them *did* pick a side (Jen’s side) and have joined in on badmouthing me. 

If Mike and I were to invite Dean, despite giving him a plus one to the wedding, we are more than certain it would cause another pointless blowup (Jen is a bit of a control freak and kinda possessive of Dean). We’re indifferent about Jen, but we still care a great deal about Dean.

Lissa is wonderful and I don't care that she's living with my brother for free. What I do care about is that her life has been on hold since she moved in with him.

His big excuse is that because London is expensive and Lissa doesn't earn much she's going to live in some shit hole but that's not true. I've already spoken to my uncle and he's willing to let her rent a place from him for cheap.

37,1g8u6w0,WIBTA for canceling plans and breaking my promise?,"I (F33) am friends with Rae (36F). We met at work about 10 years ago and we have stayed friends even after we stopped working together. We used to be a lot closer but our lives have changed a lot in the last decade, especially after I had a kid and she started her business. 

Rae loves hosting. She will throw a number of parties throughout the year, usually around major holidays. Rae’s annual Halloween party is this weekend. She texted me back in July to let me know the dates for that and her Christmas party so I can put them on my calendar. I went ahead and let her know that I should be good to attend her Christmas party but I wasn’t likely going to make it to Halloween. I let her know that I have a hold on my calendar for an immediately family member’s baby shower for that day (which ended up being moved to another day) and that another friend had already asked us to attend another event earlier that day. She expressed shock that I already had plans for that weekend because she was letting me know in JULY. I let her know once I knew more and whether or not I could get a babysitter, that I would give her a solid yes or no. But, and this is important, I did not make any promises that I would come, just that I would try. She complains that I’ve missed the last two of her Halloween parties AND that I missed Christmas last year so “I better come or else.” Although I know this is how she can be about these things, I really didn’t like how she was trying to guilt me especially since I’ve missed those parties due to things outside of my control and I thought she understood. Guess not. 

Last week Rae sends me a text with the official invite to Halloween. “Can’t wait to see you in two weeks!” I texted back: “I wish we could come, but we cant. We will be at another event earlier that day with our child, and neither of our parents were free to watch him anyway. So sorry, we’ll see you at Christmas!” She immediately replies with “But you promised!”

Again, I didn’t promise her ANYTHING. I reminded her of this, even sending screenshots of our previous messages with “See? Never did I say that I was a definite yes, I was always a maybe.” She replied with “Well, I guess I won’t be attending your birthday party this year” to bully me into coming next week. And apparently she acted the same way when some of our mutuals told her they also couldn’t attend this time. 

Upon reflection, I’m not sure having a friendship with Rae is worth it to me anymore. I don’t know if I have the energy to put up with her neuroticism anymore. There have been multiple times over the past couple of years when Rae didn’t show up for me the way a true friend would, and even though I forgive her, I haven’t forgotten.  

With all of that said, I promised to attend her Christmas party but I now don’t want to anymore. I would much rather spend that time with making memories with my family. WIBTA if I cancelled my RSVP for Christmas and rescinded my invite for my upcoming birthday party?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-21,"WIBTA for canceling plans and breaking my promise? I (F33) am friends with Rae (36F). We met at work about 10 years ago and we have stayed friends even after we stopped working together. We used to be a lot closer but our lives have changed a lot in the last decade, especially after I had a kid and she started her business. 

Rae loves hosting. She will throw a number of parties throughout the year, usually around major holidays. Rae’s annual Halloween party is this weekend. She texted me back in July to let me know the dates for that and her Christmas party so I can put them on my calendar. I went ahead and let her know that I should be good to attend her Christmas party but I wasn’t likely going to make it to Halloween. I let her know that I have a hold on my calendar for an immediately family member’s baby shower for that day (which ended up being moved to another day) and that another friend had already asked us to attend another event earlier that day. She expressed shock that I already had plans for that weekend because she was letting me know in JULY. I let her know once I knew more and whether or not I could get a babysitter, that I would give her a solid yes or no. But, and this is important, I did not make any promises that I would come, just that I would try. She complains that I’ve missed the last two of her Halloween parties AND that I missed Christmas last year so “I better come or else.” Although I know this is how she can be about these things, I really didn’t like how she was trying to guilt me especially since I’ve missed those parties due to things outside of my control and I thought she understood.

38,1g8t8hr,AITA for using therapy to insult my dad and his wife?,"My dad, his wife ""Eve"" and I (17f) are in ""family therapy"" together. We started therapy 4 weeks ago and the first week we went to see the therapist individually across the week and from the second week onward we were in the sessions together. The first session we did together the therapist did most of the talking to us and she pointed out some things she wanted us to know and keep in mind as a group. 

Last week we started doing more talking and she asked us why we felt we were in therapy. My dad said it was because Eve had been my stepmom for a very long time and was not acknowledge in an appropriate way and he felt like we needed to work this out together because it wasn't fair that she has raised me for so many years and yet she's discarded as a mother. Eve said we were in therapy because no matter how hard she tried, I would not accept and embrace her as the motherly figure she has been in our family and I broke her heart many times since she met me and now that I'm almost an adult she's hoping we can turn it around.

My answer was we're in therapy because my dad and Eve do not listen and cannot accept the fact I have never, will never, claim Eve is my mom or my second mom. I said they appear to be incapable of accepting the fact I have not changed my mind about her being my second mom and apparently they were dumb enough to think that I was lying for years about the fact Eve is not my mom. I said I had always been honest about this and never claimed otherwise. And that they believed me too young and dumb to know how I felt. So now that I was 17 and saying the same thing as always they had panicked and were still being dumb about this and thinking they can pressure me into feeling a different way.

My dad and Eve were pissed about what I said. They told me I did not get to use therapy to insult them. I pointed out I had not wanted to go to therapy with them in the first place.

The quick bg: They got married when I was 8 and I lost my mom when I was 5. That's a sensitive subject with dad because he always blamed her for her death (she went out with friends and ended up drinking too much which led to her death). And he (and Eve) think it should have made me more willing to have another mom. But I never accepted Eve as my mom. Not even when she gave me half siblings. I always said I would not call Eve mom. I have always said I have one mom. I said no to their faces when they asked me to say I have two moms. We ended up in therapy because my aunt died four years ago and my uncle is getting married again. My cousin was upset about and I was talking to him and we talked about the whole two moms thing and I said I only have one and Eve was never my mom to me and his almost stepmom doesn't have to be to him either. My dad and Eve heard, were horrified, and insisted on therapy.

Recently, Jake has gotten upset with me for not making an effort to hang out with them, for context we usually have movie night every other week, but I work two jobs, attend school full time, and am president of an organization, so it is hard to make plans on top of that. I will mention, they have not attempted to make plans either, other than one morning hangout with our friend group (during which i was at work). 

I didn’t think anything was wrong until a couple weeks ago they texted me asking if we could talk. They brought up not feeling like i had made an effort, and some stuff I had done that hurt them. I cleared up the misconceptions and stated that I also felt like an effort wasn’t being made, I also stated again how busy I am and how I haven’t had time to hang out with anyone. This conversation ended in them responding a couple days later “I let it go” which was very confusing but I figured everything was ok again. This was reaffirmed by things seeming normal when we hung out next.

Cut to a week or so later, my boyfriend (21m) gets a text from Jake asking to talk about some things. The same topics were discussed among them with the added hurt from a joke my boyfriend had made at their expense the last time we hung out and stating that they felt singled out. My boyfriend had apologized for the joke, addressing that he was in a bad mood that night and short with everyone.

41,1g8suqx,AITA for refusing to attend my sister’s “no kids” family gatherings because I’m the only one with children?,"
I’m the only one in my family with kids—two young ones, ages 4 and 6. My siblings don’t have children, and my parents are retired. Recently, my sister moved into a new house and decided she’s hosting family gatherings with a new rule: no kids allowed.

She claims her house isn’t “kid-proof” and wants more “relaxed” events. She framed it like she’s doing everyone a favor, but let’s be honest—it’s just my kids, so this rule is clearly aimed at me. It’s hurtful because these are family dinners and holiday get-togethers we’ve always celebrated together as a family. Now suddenly, my kids aren’t welcome?

What bothers me most is how this will affect my children. My 6-year-old adores his extended family, and if he finds out he’s being excluded, it would break his heart. I’m worried he’ll never get over it. How do I explain to him that he’s not wanted at these family events? It could create a rift between him and the rest of the family. He’s sensitive, and I don’t want him growing up thinking he’s not important.

When she told me about her “no kids” rule, I said I wouldn’t attend if my kids weren’t invited. She accused me of overreacting, but if this becomes the norm, what happens for holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas? Am I supposed to leave my kids at home every time?

The rest of my family is siding with her, telling me to just “go along with it” and leave the kids at home for a few hours. My parents, who don’t have grandkids from my siblings yet, think it’s no big deal. They’re even pressuring me to cut my sister some slack since she had a tough time buying her house. But where’s the consideration for me and my kids?

To top it off, my other sibling, who’s childfree, said, “Maybe this is good for you—you could probably use a break.” Great advice from someone who’s never had to juggle parenting while trying to stay connected to family.

The venue is about 2 1/2 hours from us and about 2 hours from my dad and siblings. My dad is not happy that we might decide on this venue. They are all still in elementary school so my step mom said I couldn't have my wedding before school got out for the day since the little kids have their halloween parties in school that day. So at first my fiance and I were okay with a wedding at 4:30 or 5pm that evening. Well then she said would couldn't have it to late as they need to go trick or treat. Now listen I get kids love to go trick or treating like I used to. But here is my problem now. I have found the venue of my dreams that is 2 hours away from them and now if I choose to have my wedding there and not closer (within 45 minutes of a drive for them) they will not show up. One of my sisters is my MOH and is almost 17 so she is not going to be there now if I choose this venue. I told my dad that I would buy the kids all the candy in the world if they could just skip the parties and trick or treating for one year to celebrate my fiancé's and I wedding. They still said no since the kids will want to trick or treat more. Mind you they go to about 10 different trunk or treats and church festivals before halloween for the kids. 
My grandma is also saying she has an issue with it due to her not being able to drive at night. I told her we could make accommodations such as someone else driving her or she can drive to the wedding then go stay at my aunts house who lives about 30ish minutes from the venue.

I got her a necklace for our 1 year and a bracelet for her birthday. I gave these to her on those respective dates and she got annoyed at me because she said she didn’t want anything.

46,1g8rze4,AITA for not helping my cousin who came back to work after her maternity leave.,"During my cousin's maternity leave, I was her replacement, handling her responsibilities, including teaching, exams, and corrections. Upon her return, I was hired permanently, but she resumed her previous subjects and classes while I was assigned new ones.

At that time, exams were ongoing. I completed the correction of test copies for the exam held on the 30th of the month, as well as the one on the 3rd of the next month, even though my cousin had already returned. If I hadn’t been hired permanently, I wouldn’t have been responsible for these corrections, but I still chose to help by taking on both corrections and the re-checking of test copies.

Later, my cousin asked me to complete the attendance register for the period up to the 30th. I explained that I had already marked all the holidays and that only five days of exam attendance were missing. I suggested she contact the exam department for the data, but she refused, insisting it was my responsibility. Despite this, I went ahead and completed the attendance.

Then, she was asked to provide student marks for her class and distribute subject lists to other teachers, so they could submit the marks to the exam department. She again asked me to do this, claiming she didn’t have the necessary data. I told her I had everything recorded and could send her the details, but I was busy correcting test copies (which were technically her responsibility). She refused to fill in the marks, saying it was my job because I was teaching at the time. I initially declined, but later found out she hadn’t distributed the subject lists to other teachers either. When I asked why, she said she hadn’t had time. I ended up filling in the marks and submitting them to the exam department myself.

Our school is also creating an ERP system, and we were asked to upload student data. Class teachers were specifically instructed to upload attendance, but my cousin told me I should do it because I had been the class teacher during those months. To clarify, this wasn’t a pending task from my time as a class teacher—it was a new requirement, and I was busy with my own work, including feeding the marks into the ERP system.

During this process, class teachers were asked to verify marks from the green sheet (a master list of student grades) and report any discrepancies. I checked the sheet for her, made corrections, and updated the ERP as well.

When I finally refused to upload the attendance, despite trying to help where I could, I later found out she had been bad-mouthing me, saying it was my responsibility. If she had asked politely instead of acting as though it was solely my job, I would have found time to help—perhaps not fully, but I would have marked at least a month’s worth of attendance. I’m now wondering if I was being petty by saying no.

Edit: For the people who are asking and finding it strange how come I was appointed in place of my cousin.
First I am qualified as a teacher to teach but was unemployed, so when my cousin went on maternity leave she asked me to apply as a temp, the school obviously needed a teacher because there was only one teacher of that subject (only one is needed in the entire school that's why I had to leave after she rejoins, but got selected to teach another subject which I am eligible to teach fyi), so I went through the whole selection process and got selected fortunately.

Hello.

I've read most if not all of your comments and I firmly believe that I should go and I did. I didn't enjoy canceling but the group was understanding and i don't think I lost anything there. Which really proves your guys' point. 

My mother doesn't know about any of it and I'm still annoyed about the mistake but in the end everyone seemed to be ok. I feel better that I went to the dinner and it was definitely the right decision. Funny enough, in retrospect, I can't believe I compared the 2 at all. My best guess is that the mistake plus a couple of other personal things happening atm made me insecure in my thought process.

At the time of writing this, I am home from dinner and my mother and the rest of the family had a great time. Thank you all for showing me sense. Family is and will always be more important than any game.",UPDATE,2024-10-21,"UPDATE AITA for not going to my mother's 50th birthday dinner?

According to him, if I can soothe out some of the wrinkles it should be fine with most officers, but as it is it might get refused ""if the officer is having a bad day"" (My friend's words). He also said it's my fault for trusting anyone else but me and the officer with it, which I am not denying.

I told my grandma what my friend said, and once again said I was expecting a full refund if it gets refused. She said I have to leave her alone instead of getting angry over ""just a piece of paper"". So, AITA for being that careful with birth certificates?",1.0,0.03321494534611702,0,0
56,1g8qp8x,AITA? Why won't she disclose the new job she is going for?,"I live with my partner, her 2 kids and her parents. I lost everything in my divorce including my son. She is also divorced.

Recently we have been fighting a lot. I'm scared of getting hurt again like my ex wife did to me.

I walked in today thinking everything would be alright because we haven't been fighting recently. But today I got upset because she said she is applying for a new job but didn't want to tell me where or what it is.

I'm genuinely worried about this behaviour and increasingly unhappy. I'm worried how I'm being taken for a ride. Even her own mother said she doesn't know and where this job is.

My ex wife started to do the same behaviour. I never knew her work nor her stashing of large amounts of cash. I wouldn't be surprised if my ex was also cheating.

Should I just walk away from all of this? Her 2 girls love me and her mother is close to me as well. Told her daughter that she shouldn't have asked me into her life and allowed me to enjoy the past almost 3 years together so close.

We were so close together. I have been there for her at her worst when her grandmother passed away and when she was so sick from her depression and insomnia.

I guess my question is, do I blindly trust her? I know this isn't normal or healthy to have such secrets and I wonder how much more I can take. A year ago she couldn't wait to marry me. Now I have so many flaws :(

57,1g8qinh,AITA for talking shit abt my aggressive mom? ,"My names atreyu,13.

So for a while now, I have had a big problem with my mother. I felt like everyday I would have to deal with her complaining about me talking in a slightly grumpy voice, because I'm trying to sleep when she's trying to give me an entire conversation. 

She is also very manipulative. The day before this happened, she gave me an entire lecture and made me feel like shit for being mad at her for her wrong doings. But then after that, she was being an asshole for the entire night, giving me the silent treatment when I said I had to go get some rest. She has also stated that she will stop being there for me like a mother if I keep talking shit. I know that she is the one that is never there for me in the house, but still, I need someone to be there for me if I am going through a hard time. Most of the time my dad is working and she is the only one who can provide. 

I always feel like that if I say anything in a negative manner to her that I will get beaten. She always screams at me when I made small assumptions. I don't want to know what she would do to me if I were to talk about her like that in front of her. The other day I was on a call with my girlfriend and I told her about the situation where she said that she wouldn't be there for me anymore. She bursted through my door and narcissisticly said to tell her what I did to her (which was nothing compared to what she just did to me), then she took my phone, said "" take your phone I don't want it anymore"" like a child, and threw it across the room. For the rest of the day, I was scared of my mother finding my phone and seeing the conversation I had with my girlfriend. AITA?

58,1g8qei5,AITA for making my husband take care of child before his shift?,"I am (34F) a SAHM to an autistic child (3F) who needs our constant care, she is non verbal and has several other disabilities. My husband (42M) is the primary breadwinner, which we had agreed upon before even trying to conceive our daughter. He usually works 2/2 meaning 2 weeks will be day shift and 2 weeks will be night. The night shifts are tough because I am expected to get up with our child in the morning while he sleeps in. It can be a lot because that means I’m solo all day until she goes to bed at 8pm. Autistic children, especially my daughter, can have horrible meltdowns and they can be a lot on a person mentally. I love her more than the world but the meltdowns are very draining for me. 

Last night my husband came home and decided to complain that I hadn’t folded the laundry or put dishes away, I’m the only person that cleans in this household. It was a particularly bad day and I had passed out on the couch before he had gotten home so I didn’t do the laundry or dishes. He wasn’t angry, just pointed it out. I kind of got an attitude and told him it would be nice if he could help a little around the home. He then pointed out that women stay home all the time with children and still keep the house spotless so he doesn’t understand why I can’t. I had enough so I just went to bed. 

Our daughter was up all night with a fever, and naturally she wanted to still wake up at 6AM. I was exhausted and with husband not working until 4PM, I asked him to get up with her. He complained and pouted and just let her sit there and cry. So I screamed at him to get up, that it wasn’t fair to put this all on me.

59,1g8q7zw,AITA when I filled in a form saying I aim to finish my community work ASAP.,"I don't know how people perceive these words exactly. Perhaps saying at your earliest convenience would have been better. I didn't really think this was going to urge them as the category said something like: ""When do you aim to finish the community work?"" In that sense, I just thought whenever there is work I'm going to do it and get some hours down of the 20 I need to do for school. 

I was very astonished when they said they couldn't provide community work for me asap as it stood out to me as a very cold reply after sending an email and filling out a questionnaire. Nothing is on the line so I thought it was clear I just wanted to get into it. It's not like I'm asking them to make space for me. So I know I might have been rude somehow but I think it's very clear I didn't have anything bad in mind. 

In my country, I think they are taking community work for granted because the school is making students go out of their way to do it. I wouldn't stop people from doing community work just because a sentence in a very ambiguous category they created made me upset I mean community work is free work for the good of the people and although I don't need to be praised when thinking of it like this I found it not rude to me. But rude to the cause we were trying to contribute to. 

I did not reply back, I'm instead writing this post to know if maybe I'm thinking wrong I'm not fully made up my mind as maybe I'm missing something or I'm too self-centered. 

Now as for why I think it's rude, it's because what I expected would be we could provide work on said dates, which is when they can take the volunteers, I think this was why I didn't fill out a time period I wanted to know when they could take them, but saying that in when ""I aim to do it"" wouldn't make much sense. I do however want to keep in mind in the email I provided the days I'm available ""Saturday, Sunday, and Monday any time"" 

This reply however stood to me as either cutting communication, asking for an apology, or clarifying what I meant when this entire time even before filling the form I just clearly asked if they had any work at my available times and they directed me to this form instead of answering. In the first place unless I'm missing something I think this person has created beef with me and I don't think it would be the right choice to reply and clarify the timings in the first place as even if I was in the wrong I would be better off apologizing and starting fresh in another place. 

This matter has many nuances, I will reply shortly to some of the advice as I'm looking to broaden my view but I might not be able to respond to every single one of them.

60,1g8q4nh,AITA for leaving a man on the side of the road drunk,"First time poster. I honestly just need some unbiased feedback cause trauma has made it hard to trust my own instincts. 

I (f32) have been seeing (m28) Dustin for about two and a half months now. Things started off hot and heavy, and then he got a dui about a month and a half ago and hasn’t been the same since. 

It was Saturday night, and my friend was having a birthday party at the bar as well as some live entertainment came in for a Halloween costume contest/music video recording. Before the party even really got started, he was already wasted. A friend had taken him outside several times to take pulls off some whiskey he had in his truck. He started stumbling like he always does and went outside for air. 

I told him time to go home. He said okay and went to get in my car. I had to run back in the pay my tab for the evening, and by the time I did that and came back out he was no where to be found. I called him until he answered and told him I’m at the car and he needs to come back so we can leave.

He came back to the car and his entire mood had changed. He was very short with me, slammed the door when he got in. And I said hey be easy. He waited until I was on the road headed in the direction of my home before starting in on me. 

So Dustin started yelling at me, making a lot of sharp physical gestures, getting in my face while I’m actively trying to get us home safe. I allowed this for about five minutes then I yelled back telling him to shut the fuck up and let me get us home safe so we can actually talk about it. He lost it even harder. 

I finally got fed up after another minute or two of yelling. I pulled into the campus near by to turn around. I told him fine we can go back to the bar. I’ll drop you off. He started screaming about not having his car there and demanding I take him to his car. I said absolutely not you’re wasted. He then opens my car door while I’m still driving, and I immediately stopped the car. He said let me out bitch. So I said okay go on then bye. And left him there. My concern for him went out the window after that much toxicity poured out of him. I felt more protective of myself than I did worried about his safety at that point. 

I went back to the bar, to tell my friend why I bailed and try and at least be there while she cut the cake. I also didn’t feel very much like being alone with how I was feeling after all that. About an hour passes by and I’m getting ready to be done, and Dustin walks into the bar. He looked furious. I did not want to be a part of a scene, so I told my friend happy birthday one more time, and I bailed. 

He says it’s my fault he almost got arrested again last night. That how could I care about him and do that to him. I told him funny, I was gonna say the same to you about how you treated me last night. He just keeps going on about how I went way too far to just leave him there alone and drunk.

61,1g8q2bp,AITA to cancel my travel plans with my sister,"My sister (F19) and I (F20) wanted to go to South Asia for a 4-month trip. But she has a completely different way of traveling than I do. I'm a local and adventurous traveler and she prefers the more luxurious and hotspots. Still, I don't really like all those hotspots because most of them are overrated.

Thanks to this journey, I started at a company in our area, and I really like it. Now they would like to keep me longer. But the work I do here is not often available, because it is the work I dream of.

Now I have a feeling that I don't feel like traveling bevause of my new job at all. But my sister doesn't want to do the trip alone and also finds it difficult to adapt. I have tried to make it clear to her that a trip could possibly be done in several smaller trips in addition to the upcoming trip in South Asia, but she sees this as a big mistake and now wants to do everything in one go. Because she will start a new study next year and I won't, because I would like to continue working and possibly study part-time while working. I suggested a shorter trip but she can’t accept it. 

Now she thinks I'm doing everything I can to cancel it, even though that's not the case. But because of the differences in travel styles, interests and visions of the future. I don't know anymore if I really want to do it.

I have never been very interested in Asia, but more in Africa such as safaris and culture. She is much more into Anime and Japanese styles and Asian culture. So we mainly bump into this.

She also told me that after our trip through South Asia she discussed with her boyfriend about adding 2 weeks to Japan after our trip. She then assumed that I would come along, but I said no, because that is not where my interests lie.

My sister did not have the easiest time at primary school. Lots of bullying and tantrums and you can still notice that. She has a fear of being left alone.

My sister often gets the feeling that she is alone, but I always want to do everything for her. I often make room for her in my agenda and tailor appointments to her needs. Since she now makes herself so vulnerable every time I want to bring it up. Make her angry and sad. Then behind my back she goes to my mother to tell her.

I have also talked with my mother about the situations but she picks my sisters side. She can't accept that i want something different.

My mother always thinks about my old self who wanted to be everywhere in the world and travel around. But this has changed over the years and she cannot accept that I have now acquired other interests. And that's often the excuse I get when I talk to her about the situation.

64,1g8pjbt,AITA for telling my husband’s friends to stop playing video games in the living room at our party ,"
We are an Indian  (husband is British Indian) couple both soon turning 30, living in a big city. Diwali is HUGE for Indians and I threw a big (20 person) party in our flat. I cooked three elaborate indian dishes, shopped for snacks, my husband cleaned all afternoon, we decorated the house with flowers , oil lamps and lights, we dressed up in our Indian outfits and some of the guests did too. Basically, we went ALL OUT, all guests had to do was BYOB. 

Halfway through the party when they were about 11 people left but it was still buzzing and everyone was having a great time drinking and mingling, three of my husband’s friends sat down on our sofa, switched the Xbox on and started playing video games. For reference, our living room is fairly small and an open plan so the kitchen is to the right and sofa etc is to the left with no island or anything in between. This basically meant we were all forced to hang out on the right by the kitchen as they took up the living room space and the only big sofa we have. 

I started to get really upset as the tv was super bright and jarring (55 inch tv) and it was all happening technically in the middle of the party. I asked my husband to speak to them he tried to make a joke saying “you are being anti social” but none of them took him seriously and honestly I started to get very agitated. So I went up to them and straight up asked them to please stop as it’s rude and we’re at a party (I was laughing, making jokes and staying calm), I made it sound like I wanted them to have fun too as it’s Diwali. They laughed it off, I tried again and realized I was sounding like a mom and was getting angry so I stopped before I lost my cool.

After all this, they didn’t stop and continued to play video games. Now maybe I did overreact but we worked so hard on this and I had set a certain mood with the lights, oil lamps and flowers, this was just an unwelcome addition no one expected.Everyone else was rolling their eyes at the people playing as well.

A few months ago, I lent my car to my friend, Kelly (28F), for a weekend trip. I trusted her, and I thought it would be fine. However, she ended up wrecking it—totaled the front end. She swore it was an accident and offered to pay for the repairs, but it took weeks to get it fixed, and I was out of a car during that time.

After she finally paid for the repairs, I was still feeling pretty uneasy about lending my car again. Fast forward to last week, Kelly asked to borrow my car for a family event because her car was in the shop. I hesitated and told her I was uncomfortable lending it out again after what happened last time. She got really upset and accused me of not trusting her.

I tried to explain my feelings, but she kept insisting that I was being dramatic and that it was just an accident. Now, our mutual friends are divided—some think I should give her another chance, while others agree that I have every right to be cautious.

I feel terrible for letting her down, but I also think my feelings are valid given the circumstances.

The night of the concert was a great time. Afterwards, we went out for pizza and came back to the hotel room where we all promptly fell asleep. 

Lucy, my mom, and I were all abruptly woken up by Sally’s snoring around midnight. We aren’t talking light, ignore it snoring. Big, heavy, log-sawing snoring. It was guttural. It filled the hotel room, and even with the ear plugs I brought, the 3 of us could not sleep. We woke Sally up and asked her to change positions, she said okay and, without changing positions, fell back asleep and resumed the heavy machinery like snoring. 

We woke her up again, asking if she could sit up for a moment and give the rest of us a head 
start at falling asleep. We had hoped that if we fell asleep first that we’d be able to sleep through the racket. Again, she said okay, immediately fell back asleep, leaving the 3 of us with no chance to do it ourselves.

So, we woke her up a third time. We were harsher than previous attempts and explained that none of us could sleep with her snoring.

Sally woke up, and said she’d go sleep in the car because she was frustrated by US waking HER up. She accused us of kicking her out and claimed she didn’t want to stay in the room any longer. We didn’t say anything to stop her but we also didn’t kick her out. We were really just hoping for a window of time without snoring so the rest of us could fall asleep.

Sally mentioned earlier in the day that the rest of us would have to “find a way” to deal with her snoring tonight. This caught my attention because she never mentioned it during the planning stages or made it known to the rest of us that she had this issue. She knew it may be a problem but never said anything or gave us a chance to make plans that accommodate a loud snorer. To my knowledge, she also has never tried to get medical assistance with this issue (although it sounds like it is desperately needed).

I think we may be TAH because we didn’t object to her leaving the room or trying to dissuade her from sleeping in the car. It was close to 1AM by the time we had the 3rd interaction and we were all desperate for sleep so we didn’t raise any objections.

67,1g8pbuw,AITA for not responding to my partners texts immediately? ,"Hi, I’m going to try to keep this as brief as possible. 

Basically, last night I got into a bit of an argument with my partner because he said he doesn’t like it when it takes me five - ten minutes to respond to a text. 

I have explained to him multiple times that there’s certain things I do because I’m autistic, and one of these things is stimming to help regulate my emotions. Because of this, sometimes I might not have the capacity to respond to a text or “stay in a conversation” constantly. But I never leave a text without a response for more than five minutes. 

I had to explain this again to him last night because he kept telling me that he thinks I’m just talking to other people if I don’t respond right away. Again, I have tried to explain myself multiple times and find it embarrassing each time I have to do it. (I was only diagnosed last year so I’m still working on a lot of internalised ableism towards myself and he knows this). 

The conversation pretty much ended on him saying he thinks I’m lying and doesn’t think I would need to regulate myself during a normal conversation. He then said he needed space and hasn’t talked to me since. 

This really hurt my feelings because I really do just need that few minutes to regulate sometimes. He always tells me he’d never judge me and he’ll try to be accommodating but I feel like whenever I actually show symptoms of my autism, it seems like he suffers because of it and he always ends up bringing it up whenever I tell him something he’s done has hurt me. 

The way he talked to me made me feel like there was something wrong with the way I was communicating and like I wasn’t doing enough to satisfy his communication needs.

68,1g8nyv1,AITA for bringing up just how much I actually do for our household to my wife?,"Can't believe I actually have a reason to post something on reddit, but here I am.

My wife (41F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years. 

I apparently surprised her by being capable of doing household chores and tasks, which I didn't think much of. My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything.

I do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques.  It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two.

The only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted.

I've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home.

I offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time.

One of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all.

Then they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids.

I came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage.

She told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her.

Since then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head. I didn't intend for that or to make her feel guilty at all.

I don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice. I can't help but feel like her friends think I'm some sort of deadbeat who comes home to relax and neglect her.

71,1g8msug,AITA for not going to a meeting my stepsister and and her mom had with our principal?,"When I (16f) was 6 (almost 7) and my stepsister (16f) was 7 we each lost a parent in an accident that happened locally. This made my dad and her mom close and they ended up getting married two years after the accident. My stepsister hated her mom marrying my dad. She didn't want her mom to move on so fast and she didn't want to be my family. We didn't really know each other before even though we were in the same school but she resented the idea that from that accident she needed to get a step anything let alone a stepdad and a stepsister. She bullied me which was something her mom and my dad did address. But then she got sneaky about it and told me she'd make my life worse if her mom found out it was still happening and I believed her. It started out with her calling me names (when the adults knew) and telling kids at school I wet the bed because my mommy died in a really taunting way. When it got more secretive she'd wish me dead and she'd tell me that she hoped the rest of my family would die and I'd end up all alone. She also told me my dad loved her mom more than mine but that her mom would always love her dad more. She warned me she'd show embarrassing photos of me too if I didn't do what she said.

It got so bad that my dad kept trying to make me tell him and two years after I had stopped letting him know what was happening, I spilled my guts about it. Dad was so upset/angry and my stepsister was punished really harshly for it as well as getting a new therapist, she already had one but a new one was found. We also did some ""family"" therapy together. But I never really saw her as family and honestly I say stepsister to stop any complaints about me saying dad's wife's daughter after all this time because I know people expect some kind of family unity.

Things have now turned for her and she's been bullied really badly at school. I know and I don't care at all. I don't feel bad for her. To me it's a crappy person being treated the same way she treated me. I know she was young and it's basically stopped (because she doesn't want to be punished, not because she likes me or regrets it) but I just don't care. I hate that we're still related through marriage. Some photos of my stepsister were sent around school which caused a really big bullying incident last week and she locked herself in the girls bathroom. My stepmom made plans to talk with the principal and she and dad wanted me there as support for my stepsister but I didn't go and they don't like that I didn't go. All weekend we had these talks about how it would have been good to support my stepsister and how I know bullying and could be more empathetic. I told my dad I can't find it for her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-21,"AITA for not going to a meeting my stepsister and and her mom had with our principal? When I (16f) was 6 (almost 7) and my stepsister (16f) was 7 we each lost a parent in an accident that happened locally. This made my dad and her mom close and they ended up getting married two years after the accident. My stepsister hated her mom marrying my dad. She didn't want her mom to move on so fast and she didn't want to be my family. We didn't really know each other before even though we were in the same school but she resented the idea that from that accident she needed to get a step anything let alone a stepdad and a stepsister. She bullied me which was something her mom and my dad did address. But then she got sneaky about it and told me she'd make my life worse if her mom found out it was still happening and I believed her. It started out with her calling me names (when the adults knew) and telling kids at school I wet the bed because my mommy died in a really taunting way. When it got more secretive she'd wish me dead and she'd tell me that she hoped the rest of my family would die and I'd end up all alone. She also told me my dad loved her mom more than mine but that her mom would always love her dad more. She warned me she'd show embarrassing photos of me too if I didn't do what she said.

It got so bad that my dad kept trying to make me tell him and two years after I had stopped letting him know what was happening, I spilled my guts about it. Dad was so upset/angry and my stepsister was punished really harshly for it as well as getting a new therapist, she already had one but a new one was found. We also did some ""family"" therapy together. But I never really saw her as family and honestly I say stepsister to stop any complaints about me saying dad's wife's daughter after all this time because I know people expect some kind of family unity.

Things have now turned for her and she's been bullied really badly at school. I know and I don't care at all. I don't feel bad for her. To me it's a crappy person being treated the same way she treated me. I know she was young and it's basically stopped (because she doesn't want to be punished, not because she likes me or regrets it) but I just don't care. I hate that we're still related through marriage. Some photos of my stepsister were sent around school which caused a really big bullying incident last week and she locked herself in the girls bathroom. My stepmom made plans to talk with the principal and she and dad wanted me there as support for my stepsister but I didn't go and they don't like that I didn't go. All weekend we had these talks about how it would have been good to support my stepsister and how I know bullying and could be more empathetic. I told my dad I can't find it for her. That I just do not like her or think she can ever be someone I would help or support.

They're pretty pissed with me and the only reason they didn't punish me is because of what happened before.

74,1g8lpjy,AITA for going to a strip club?,"When my girlfriend and I got together we ended up talking about things that we wouldn't accept from the other person eg what we classed as cheating etc. 

One of the things my girlfriend mentioned was going to a strip club. She said she wouldn't have an issue with me going to a club and she'd be fine with it but she'd draw the line at getting a private dance. 

I told her I'd never really saw the appeal of strip clubs anyway and that I see paying for dances etc as a waste of money.

 It's come up a few times in conversation since as some of her friends went to watch a male stripper show and a relative of mine hired strippers for his friends stag do and every time it came up my girlfriends opinion remained the same. 

It was a friend of mine's 30th birthday a couple of weeks ago and a group of us went to a different city for the night to go out for drinks. After a few drinks my friend wanted to go to a strip club.

 A few of the group wanted to go and a couple of us didn't but since it was his birthday we all went. Some of them paid for private dances but I stayed near the bar with one of the guys and had a few games of pool. 

The dancers were walking around trying to talk people into private dances. The next morning I travel home. My girlfriend asks how the night was and I tell her it was good. 

I tell her about the places we went and she was fine with it ad happy I had a good time and that I respected her boundary and didn't get a private dance.

She mentioned to a friend of hers about the night and her friend immediately starts saying how disgusting I am and how my girlfriend shouldn't put up with it. 

When my girlfriend got home she said what her friend said and that she thinks I shouldn't have gone to the club. 

I point out she was fine with it until her friend told her she shouldn't be. I told her she shouldn't be letting her friend dictate what the boundaries are in our relationship and that she had no concerns at all until her friend had a different view. 

My girlfriend just said that her friend said how disrespectful it is what I have done and that I should apologise. 

I told her I'm not apologising just because her friend thinks I should and that we should be the one deciding our boundaries, not her friends but she said she think I'm being unreasonable.

Her disability is one that affects her physical health progressively and her mental health is also impacted by this.

When the children were younger our mother was healthier and she was able to look after the children, We wanted to enable the grandparent relationship. 

Recently whilst Fliss was staying there (7 at the time) she left her outside on a main road in a city whilst she went shopping.  The  she and Fliss met a man in a park, she let Fliss go to walk a dog with him and gave him her address,  she did not have any details of this man, except first name. Fliss was returned 2 hours later!  

After this I set very clear boundaries that she was not to leave children with anyone and if they are going out she must remain with them at all times. 

Jamie and Laura have advised they have got stuck in an apparatus ant the park and could not get down until a passer helped

There have been many times one of the kids have said that she has fallen over / fallen out of her wheelchair when they have been out. 

Both Matt and I and SO’s have tried explaining our concerns. We have been called over dramatic, anxious, controlling. 

Her falls are getting worse and she constantly battles infections.  In Feb she had sepsis. This was very sudden and was in hospital 3 months.  During my SO and I helped and visited daily sometimes with our kids sometimes not. We helped her move house to somewhere with a care element, it broke us mentally managing this alongside work, schooling and extracurricular activities. we were advised her needs have changed and she needs to be in her wheelchair all the time and that she is at high risk of sepsis. Sepsis is hard to spot in her and from research can come on with a hour.  

Matt and I have made a decision that due to her actions in the recent years with the children and due to her own health, we do not think it is appropriate for her to solely look after the children and will do things as a family and ensure she is included. She keeps saying how she is going to do X Y and Z with them, when I gently remind about it and suggest one of us come she blows up and says we are discriminating against her disability, which hurts,  as this is about the safety of our children. 

Recently she has been rude and vile about myself and Matt and SO’s. we find spending time with her hard but are pushing through for family.

76,1g8ll1x,AITA? My neighbor (40sF) is mad at me(25F) for not texting her back? ,"My neighbor is in her mid 40s and from the east coast, she’s lived here for awhile now (we live in the Midwest). She was quite friendly, VERY outgoing and is kind of a busybody (knows everything about everyone, knows everyone in the building, etc.) she had no qualms about immediately telling me her life story and decided that I would be her little sister. She’s constantly asking to feed me, to give me things to buy me things etc. I always say no, mainly because i barely know her, it’s impolite etc. I am a little standoffish with new people and am an introvert which she noticed and pointed out as weird. I think she thought I was being stuck up. I just told her I’m shy, which is the truth. 

She offered me an old couch because I didn’t have any furniture and after saying no multiple times, I gave in and took it so she would stop pestering me and it’d be nice to have furniture. I offered to pay her for it which she declined because she’s a “good person.”This is where I fucked up. 

Maybe she sees me as her little project because I’m new or something but the way we’ve interacted in only a month of living here is starting to make me uncomfortable. Anyways, a few nights after getting the couch she texted me at 1am and I didn’t respond bc I was tired and went back to sleep. I had work in the morning so I forgot to respond back to her. Well, she took this as a slight and is now rolling her eyes at me in the hallways and is yelling profanities at because she saw me? I am confused because I never gave her the impression that I wanted to be best friends with her. But I think she thinks that because she gave me the couch, I now have to say yes to the hanging out that I have always said no to. The food I have always said no to. I wanted to text her and ask her what I did wrong so I can apologize and explain that I didn’t mean to come off any type of way, but I think she already had/has this idea of me, and it wouldn’t fit her narrative anyway. That’s all good and well but we are neighbors and she knows everyone in the building. I’ve only ever really talked to the maintenance man who I think knows that she’s kind of lonely and keeps his distance. I don’t want her to cause any problems with management or whatever in my safe space. I like it here so far, and don’t want any issues. What do I do? Am I the asshole?

Rent: 3,850

Rent split-
Guy 1: 1400
Guy 2: 1100

We had a written agreement (signed) that stated while they sublet (before lease renewal and subsequent occupancy change) they would pay their rent split, and in that payment they will use the utilities and amenities free of charge (“all inclusive”). I was trying to be nice, and wanted their transition as our roommates to be a smooth and pleasant one. Respectively, 3 and 5 months after their move in, they’re on the lease and have now refused to do an increase in what they pay to cover four way cost of utilities and amenities. Wanting to avoid conflict and resentment (our initial agreement of utilities included is done), so I said OK but please at least cover the energy bill four ways. That energy bill was paid once or twice, but they’ve now refused to pay their portion this month and moving forward. Since I was stuck paying energy in addition to all other shared bills, I decided to change wifi name and password. Guy 1 works from home, Guy 2 takes online courses. They both utilise the electricity, significantly. We have a sit down tonight to go over what’s going to happen moving forward. Frankly, if I’m not completely happy with this outcome, I’ve decided with my boyfriend that we will break the lease and everyone can go their separate way.


EDIT/FINAL UPDATE:

It ended up working out! We came to an agreement everyone felt good about, and that’s all I cared about. Only sucky thing is it will start in November, so they will not take responsibility of fair split for October bills. Oh well, can’t win everything.

78,1g8lgh0,AITA for being disappointed in my siblings gender?,"Last week my mum had a small, intimate gender reveal for myself and my 3 other sisters. For context I am 20 and I don’t live at home but I am here every day, my other sisters are 17, 5, and 3. Since I was 5 I’ve raised my siblings which hasn’t been a problem for me, my mum has had a really rough time but has gotten a lot better, she just needs help. When I found out she was pregnant with the 5th I was pretty excited, as exhausted as I am I thought maybe this would finally be the boy. Surprise… it wasn’t. I was pretty disappointed, I’ve raised 3 girls so far and I was hoping maybe this time I would get the brother we’ve been waiting on. I had a bit of a cry and quickly got over it and knew I would love her the same as all the other girls. My mum, however, lost her shit. She called me an ungrateful c*nt and said I was horrible, she was just as upset as I was but apparently I was the bad person because I had a bit of gender disappointment. Long story short I’ve been told I am not allowed back at her house and to stay at my own. That’s exactly what I did and now she’s been begging me to come back and watch the girls, my 17 year old sister can drive but obviously goes to school so she’s been dropping by every day and bringing things over slowly to start staying at mine permanently (legally she’s allowed to do this so that’s fine and I’m happy for her to, she works and we’ve already spoken about her chipping in for rent). I’ve not had a moment of silence from my mother calling and texting calling me names and then apologising and begging me to come back. I really don’t know what to do.

Also I’m very sorry if this was written badly, I haven’t slept for days and have been so emotionally exhausted on top of that from all of the things that have transpired over the week. 

UPDATE:

I spoke to multiple family members, including my stepdad. I also spoke to a few professionals. I also spoke to my mother about what I have found out since posting this about parentification.

I spoke to both a lawyer and a therapist, I’m not sure how much I can share about these interactions but the therapist was pretty clear in telling me this was abuse and to go low contact. The lawyer was more as a way of making sure if I had to I could get custody/guardianship of these kids if something were to happen.

My mum was not happy. She stopped calling me names and instead just told me to leave, I refused because I honestly was scared for her wellbeing and she admitted she has kept getting pregnant because she wants a boy (she still loves all of my sisters so much, I want to make this very clear). We spoke about me raising them and how it’s been going on since I was 5, she has admitted she bit off more than she could chew by having all of us. I let her know 17 is moving in with me and she broke down. Currently stepdad is away, he left 2 nights ago. We all have decided that I will take the kids until she can pull herself together. If she hasn’t taken her meds or doesn’t pull herself together within a set time frame I will be going to court for these kids (they don’t deserve to be mistreated by her and I also don’t want her to take advantage of the fact that I have taken them). My stepdad has agreed to this, we’ve also agreed he will keep his job but be paying “child support” to me until my mum is okay again.

I know this isn’t the greatest outcome for me but this isn’t a situation where I can be selfish, 3 other lives have to be taken into account in this.

Unfortunately because of this I have had to break my lease on my apartment but I have spoken to my grandparents and they are more than happy for me to go in there until I can find a bigger place for us.

Last week my mum had a small, intimate gender reveal for myself and my 3 other sisters. For context I am 20 and I don’t live at home but I am here every day, my other sisters are 17, 5, and 3. Since I was 5 I’ve raised my siblings which hasn’t been a problem for me, my mum has had a really rough time but has gotten a lot better, she just needs help. When I found out she was pregnant with the 5th I was pretty excited, as exhausted as I am I thought maybe this would finally be the boy. Surprise… it wasn’t. I was pretty disappointed, I’ve raised 3 girls so far and I was hoping maybe this time I would get the brother we’ve been waiting on. I had a bit of a cry and quickly got over it and knew I would love her the same as all the other girls. My mum, however, lost her shit. She called me an ungrateful c*nt and said I was horrible, she was just as upset as I was but apparently I was the bad person because I had a bit of gender disappointment. Long story short I’ve been told I am not allowed back at her house and to stay at my own. That’s exactly what I did and now she’s been begging me to come back and watch the girls, my 17 year old sister can drive but obviously goes to school so she’s been dropping by every day and bringing things over slowly to start staying at mine permanently (legally she’s allowed to do this so that’s fine and I’m happy for her to, she works and we’ve already spoken about her chipping in for rent). I’ve not had a moment of silence from my mother calling and texting calling me names and then apologising and begging me to come back. I really don’t know what to do.

Also I’m very sorry if this was written badly, I haven’t slept for days and have been so emotionally exhausted on top of that from all of the things that have transpired over the week. 

UPDATE:

I spoke to multiple family members, including my stepdad. I also spoke to a few professionals. I also spoke to my mother about what I have found out since posting this about parentification.

I spoke to both a lawyer and a therapist, I’m not sure how much I can share about these interactions but the therapist was pretty clear in telling me this was abuse and to go low contact. The lawyer was more as a way of making sure if I had to I could get custody/guardianship of these kids if something were to happen.

I understand that my point of view is biased based on the things I've said and the hurt that I have experienced from both our marriage and the aftermath, but I truly believe that it's not fair to anyone for her to force herself into a situation like this and expect me to just not be uncomfortable merely because my kids are involved.

82,1g8k0pf,AITA for telling people about a situationship I was in with a friend?,"
About two years ago, I got into a strange situation ship with one of my friends. I had a crush on them but they had romantic partners (polyamorous). One day, they brought up becoming friends with benefits, and I agreed feeling like it was the closest I would get to a romantic relationship with them. We were both young and I was figuring myself out. We never ended up doing anything too far, just making out on the couch, etc , but they did suggest it a few times. I would get rly nervous and decline, and they would immediately back off. So I realized this situation wasn't working for me, we called it off, still friends.

 About a month ago, I was talking to some people in a club i'm in, and we were talking about past romantic relationships. I brought that story up, not mentioning my friend by name. Someone I knew a bit more personally (kinda ex-friend, don't talk to, drama, etc) was in this conversation, and I had earlier mentioned the friend by name. The ex friend pieces together they were who I was talking about, and i didn't deny it, because he already knew, but the other people did not know who we were talking about. 

I should've denied it. I shouldn't have spoken about it at all, because this morning, I got a message from my friend saying that they are very upset, and might not want to be friends anymore. They said I have a right to tell my story, but they didn't like how I told a whole group of people about the private situation, and that from what they heard, I made it sound like they had coerced me into it. They said they are sorry if I felt that way, but that was never communicated to them. I am so horrified. The only person who could've told them that I had said that would be the ex-friend, who is not on good terms with my friend. I knew that, but I foolishly thought he would keep his word and not tell anyone he knew. I shouldn't said any of this, i've sent an extensive apology, I feel like dogshit, and I'm scared to lose this friendship. I shouldn't have put my need to fit in over my friend. 

My apology went along the lines of ""I'm so sorry, I never mentioned you by name, and I never felt that way. I tried to emphasize that you weren't at fault and I was just figuring myself out. The experience made me understand things about myself, and I felt safe enough to tell you about it. I understand if you want a break from our friendship, and I should've been more careful with my words. If there is anything I can do to show I'm sorry, I will do it. I have broken your trust, and I know it's not a 'just apologize' situation There is no excuse for my actions, and I should have thought more. I'm so sorry if my actions have affected your relationship with the people I told it to. I should've thought about how you would feel, and I didn't. And that was wrong""

So I just left and just as I pull up to my driveway he texts me “yo dude where are you”. I told him that I already left and I’m at home. He responds with “WTF, come pick me up. Why did you leave”. I told him that he’s been talking to that woman for over 1:30 hours and I have shit to do. He responds with “Why didn’t you just tell me, fucking dumbass. Come pick me up”. I responded with “Nah, I’m already home. You can take the bus, it’s 15 minutes. It’s literally faster than waiting for me for 15 minutes”. He responds with “it’s fucking cold out and I didn’t bring my jacket. Just fucking come”. I said no. He responds with “I’m never going to the gym with you. You’re such a fucking dumbass.

88,1g8iw2l,AITA for only wanting a justice of the peace and nice dinner afterwards instead of an actual wedding. ,"For context, My fiance (M45) and I (F42) have been together about 6 years and engaged for almost 5 of those years. Neither have been married before, although I've been engaged a few times in the past. We've bought a house, have everything we need. Now, I've never been the girl who's dreamed about her wedding day. I really feel that the relationship itself is what's important and that spending thousands of dollars to pretend to be a princess for a day and have a huge party, is just not worth it to me. When I was younger, the only parts of a wedding that appealed to me were my dad walking me down the isle and the dance with him at the reception. My Dad passed away about 5 years ago, so for me, I know a wedding would feel sad in a lot of ways. I'm also not super close to much of my family and the family I do have would create a lot of drama about who's invited/where we're having it, etc etc and I'm just not here for it. We have maybe 20 ppl total we'd want there. Neither of us are really religious at all, so I genuinely wanted to just get a nice dress and him a nice suit and go to the justice of the peace back where he's from and then host a nice sit down dinner afterwords at a nice restaurant than could do a private room. He could have his best man and I'd have my daughter as MOH and that's it. No bridesmades, no dj, no seating charts. People can take their own pictures. My fiance would still have every person that's important to him there. Also, we both quit drinking a few years back and I know he doesn't want to host a big drunk party with our families. I don't care if ppl want a drink with their dinners, but we both know how our families would get.

91,1g8irhl,AITA because i didnt made take away breakfast for my husband but me? ,"So here is the thing: Me (32) and my husband have two kids (2;4). For a couple weeks now i attend collage after beeing home for the kids for 4 years now. They go to Kindergarten. The last weeks my husband was often unhappy that he didnt had any breakfast he could take to work with him and i told him several times he would have to make himself some the evening before because time is tight. Besides getting kids ready for school and taking care of him (he had a surgery and his wound needs some care every day and as im a nurse i gladly take care of it) i also have to get ready myself now. Everyone wants something from me and at the end there is just no time to make some bagel or something. He often got angry about it but let it go. 

So last Friday i told him that he has to make himself some breakfast the night before (as many times before) or wont have any anymore as i take care of everything myself already. If he wants some breakfast he now has to step up for himself as im not his maid or mom. And if we want to be loving Partners he cant blame me for it and treat me more like his maid then spouse. So yesterday evening came and i reminded him to make himself something. He went to bed without doing so while I cleaned up the rest of the house (just a quick 10 min refresh) and made myself food for the morning. Put it in the fridge. This morning time was short again. He did bring the kids to Kindergarten. Before he left the house he he saw me packing my breakfast in my backpack and he asked me where his is. I said i dont know. Did u make yourself some? 

He said no and claimed im beeing petty made myself some but not him. 

I said i reminded him to make himself some or he wont have some. Obviously we went out the house stressed about it. 

Yes i could have made him some but if i dont do it like this he will never step up for himself. Now i feel more like his mom then ever as i have to „educate“ him about such simple stuff but feel like i have too. 

Hope i raise my son better then that 🙄

96,1g8hskr,AITAH best friend back with toxic ex ,"AITAH? I’m gonna try and keep it short. So my best friend broke up with her boyfriend of 2 years at the beginning of this year ultimately because he was verbally abusive. Telling her she was too overweight for him and that she wasn’t sexy enough and constantly was putting her down, checking out girls in front of her, and also saying how he thought she was a 4/10 in his eyes. As a result, I spent 6-7 months trying to help her find confidence within herself and helped her through very very difficult times, I’m talking hours of being on the phone listening to her sob, rant, and say she hates him. They broke up and it resulted in her having a severe eating disorder which was EXTREMELY triggering to be around bc I was just recovering from mine in therapy. I spent months listening to her rant for HOURS AND DAYS as a best friend I did not mind but after a while, it became extremely emotionally exhausting after a couple of months of the same thing. She then decided to reintroduce him into her life and they decided to be friends and even as friends they had issues. but once she started to hang out with him again she began to call me less and not be as ‘needy’ as usual which also felt like i was being used as an ear to rant to. She told me a couple of days ago that she’s decided to get back together with him because he’s in therapy and is focusing on being ‘better’ for her bc he loves her. I can’t help but be frustrated about this. Am I overreacting? I hate that he got a second chance after treating her so poorly. AITAH for being annoyed and feeling betrayed because it feels like the advice I gave her and all the time I spent trying to help her was disregarded. i am not a fan of him whatsoever and I don’t believe for a minute he has changed, i just think hes on his best behavior for now.

97,1g8hn66,"AITA for not attending my former best friend and BIL’s 2nd wedding, with his ex wife that he abandoned for two years (w/ his 4 kids)?","Over the last 15+ years I became in my mind, best friends with my BIL. He ran off with another woman and was living a double life with her and her children. Then ultimately ended up divorced from his wife of 10+ years and left her and his 4 children. After some time they ended up getting back together. With less than two weeks notice we were sent an invitation to their second wedding via a group text message. We already have plans. On top of having plans, we have absolutely no desire to attend.

This started with him ghosting everyone in his life, including his family. He would disappear and not tell his wife where he was for days/weeks at a time. Since I (thought I was) close to him I slowly figured out a few things that he had going on. But he never talked to me about any of this even when I tried to pry it out of him.

The process of his divorce began one day when his ex asked me if he was okay, or if I had heard from him because she had not for some time. Him and I weren’t talking at this point but I had connected plenty of dots and had actual, legitimate proof of what had been going on. I also don’t think the gal he ran off with was the only time he was screwing other women, but not my business.

The SIL didn’t want to believe any of what was happening because a lot of it seemed unbelievable to her. It was when he was trying to purchase a lavish home to live in with his GF that the ex actually got a lawyer and started taking a little advice. She was able to stop him from purchasing it with his GF since they were still married legally. But he did purchase the home and then proceeded to live there with his GF. No divorce proceedings had even started at this point, this is just when our SIL maybe believed us.

After all this, he ended up with nobody, and soon came crawling back to his ex wife. Popping in and out of his kids’ lives, adding to their newfound abandonment issues. Confusing everyone involved. She soon took him back.

The mansion is for sale and they lost a lot because of his bad decisions. I tried having conversations with him and tried to confront him for quite some time before it got to the point that it did. He would always cancel on me or not answer. I never wanted to go behind his back to his wife, but he was going to ruin his family’s lives and leave them with NOTHING.

His ex wife/fiancé has never shown any gratitude or thanks for the things people did to help and has really treated some of them poorly.

Is he doing the right thing for his family? Maybe, but I don’t know. I personally think that he hasn’t changed.

My wife wants nothing to do with their wedding either and to my knowledge, we are the only members of his immediate family not attending. Some of my wife’s family members are pushing us to go and acting like we’re the bad guys.

98,1g8hk80,AITA petty argument with husband,"My husband and I (early 30s) are planning a small camping trip for our anniversary. Friday evening I mentioned I want us to get all the gear together so we can make a list of anything we need, buy that ahead, and have low stress the actual weekend of our trip.

Undisputedly, he agreed to do this with me. Also, this is not something we usually do. Honestly, usually he checks all the gear is there or we run through the list verbally right before we head out. Many times we leave later than I would like though, so in my mind this would streamline and give us an earlier start next weekend. 

Anyways, today is Sunday and in the morning I mention wanting to get that done before the end of the day. We go out, come back for lunch. As he is making lunch he hands me some of our camping cookware and tells me to do it. I, thinking we are going to do it together, say we can do it after lunch.   After lunch he starts reading so I work on some things. He comes up to me after reading and I say can we do that camping gear thing now. 

He responds ""why haven't you done anything yet"" in an annoyed way. Things escalated from there. In hindsight I feel like I should have just done it by myself or responded ""I get started and you'll join me?"" Instead I was defensive. 

My point is he agreed to do this with me and the phrasing ""why haven't you.."" would make anyone defensive.

His point is I was getting too fixated on this and should have done it myself instead of bringing it up so many times verbally. 

Writing this out I see his point... still I'll post for outside perspectives. Thanks in advance.

100,1g8hfuu,AITA for Liking K-Pop While My Boyfriend Disapproves?,"I'm in a two-year relationship with my boyfriend, and I’ve been a K-pop fan since middle school. I first discovered BTS in sixth grade, and since then, I’ve also loved groups like Monsta X and Twice. For a while, I was really active in the K-pop community, regularly tuning into V Lives and collecting photocards and merchandise. However, as life got busier with school and other commitments, my involvement naturally faded. I still enjoy watching their music videos and sharing updates on my Instagram, but it's not as consuming as it once was.

Lately, though, my boyfriend and I have had some arguments about my interest in K-pop, particularly boy groups. He feels that I’m too obsessed, and this tension began when I started sharing K-pop edits on TikTok. I thought reposting fun or interesting content, including both boy and girl group edits, would be harmless, especially since many of my friends also enjoy K-pop without issue.

At first, he didn't seem to mind when I watched K-pop, but about a year into our relationship, he expressed concerns over my liking and reposting of certain edits, which he labeled as ""thirst traps."" He even mentioned how his friends questioned my behavior, comparing the edits to porn. I was taken aback, feeling misunderstood, but I tried to be understanding and agreed to stop reposting the edits that bothered him.

I thought that would resolve the issue, but then things escalated again when he saw a Jungkook photocard I had on the back of my phone. He got really upset and accused me of being obsessed again. After a heated argument, I removed the photocard to keep the peace. For a while, we were fine until a couple of weeks ago, during a conversation about celebrity crushes. When I mentioned Jungkook and how I thought he was cute, my boyfriend got angry again, insisting that I shouldn't call other guys cute. He questioned whether I'd feel comfortable if he did the same about other girls. I told him I was okay with celebrity crushes since they’re unattainable, but he disagreed, leading to yet another mini-fight.

Since then, I’ve tried to avoid watching boy groups around him and have stopped sharing K-pop content on social media. Watching my favorite shows isn’t as enjoyable anymore, and it feels like I’m losing a part of my passion. I’m starting to wonder how to balance my interests with his feelings, and whether it’s possible to find a middle ground where I can enjoy K-pop without causing conflict.

101,1g8hbs6,AITA for not immediately agreeing to quit grad school and move across the country with my boyfriend?,"(22f) started grad school a few months ago. It’s hard work, but for the most part I love it. I live with my boyfriend (25m) “Peeta” (comment 🍞 if you get the reference). We’ve lived together for a year, been dating for two.  
Peeta has a well-paying job in a well-known company. Recently he got a promotion. The only problem is, the job requires him to move across the country.  
He doesn’t want to do long-distance; he’s done it before and it always ended badly or with cheating. His solution is for me to move with him. He makes more than enough to support both of us, so I could quit grad school and just stay home.

I don’t know how to feel about this. On the one hand, I don’t want to stop going to my dream school and I don’t want to move. On the other, I love him and could probably find a decent enough school in the city. But it won’t be anything like my current school (My mom went here. She passed away when I was in middle school, so just being here makes me feel connected to her).  
When he first brought this up, I said I’d think about it. Now I’m struggling with what I should do. But I feel bad for leaving him hanging. He says I can have as much time to think it over as I want, but we both know I don’t have forever. I feel like an asshole for making him wait, especially because if I don’t agree to go, we’d most likely break up. AITA? Or is he an asshole for expecting me to drop everything and move across the country with him?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kind comments and support. I don’t have time to reply to every comment, but I read every one. I will try to talk to him about this later today.

  
UPDATE: Hi everyone. I think this will be my last update for a while. Maybe I’ll do one in five years or so (if anyone is interested). I’ll still reply to any comments, but my decision has been made.

Peeta said he had something to show me. I said I had something to tell him; he told me to go first. 

I will be quiting grad school and moving with him. I will also stay at home.

I explained to him that after thinking it over for a few days, I realized the only reason I even wanted to go to grad was for my mom. I wanted her to be proud of me, but I now hope she’ll still be proud of me if I don’t have a professional career. I have very little interest in the field I’ve been studying, as well. I told him I‘d love to move with him, and I’ll be dropping out of school on Friday.

He was really happy that I chose to go with him, and for our future in a new city. I asked what he wanted to show me, and he said it could wait.

He took me out to dinner tonight. It was a really nice place. To the couple of commenters that talked about marriage, well, he proposed. He got down on one knee after we had dessert, and I said yes. We are going to move in late December, and I want to get married next August. He‘s left all the planning up to me, which I couldn’t be happier about.

Most of the comments said I shouldn’t go, or we should break up. I completely understand that perspective; from the outside looking in. 

If I regret anything in the future, I’ll probably make another post about it. For now, I‘m happy with my decision, even with the complications. I’ll miss my friends and my little sister, but I’m sure we’ll stay in touch. 

I hope you all respect my decision, even if you don’t agree with it. Thank you again for all the love and support. I really do appreciate all your advice; it really gave me something to think about.

103,1g8h34h,AITA for talking to a girl’s boyfriend when she didn’t “allow” it?,"
I (16F) met this online friend (19M) sometime last year when his girlfriend (18F, also online dating) cheated on him; it was bad. We talked for 2 days where I gave him advice but they ended up getting back together and he blocked me. 

Fast forward a month or two, we had more mutual friends but still ignored each other for the most part. One day, he asked if anyone could talk because he was on the verge of ending it. I think I made an unrelated snarky remark in chat and he asked if I could talk.

His girlfriend has a plethora of issues, namely BPD and schizophrenia. From the messages he showed me, she was highly unstable and talked a lot of trash about me (even though I only knew her boyfriend for two days beforehand).

Anyways, from the messages shown, she was asking if they could just be friends whilst still flirting with and spending time with him. I told him that this was her way of getting his time and money without any commitment. She was talking to multiple guys at the time according to him.

They were broken up at that point. Two days after the break-up, my friend (the guy) found another girl to rebound with. Obviously this wasn’t healthy but he didn’t listen no matter what we said, which was whatever.

However, he got back with his ex girlfriend again a few weeks after their initial break-up. She seemed okay with us being friends, even wanting to meet me. I shut it down explaining that I didn’t like the fact that she cheated and how I had a bad experience being friends with someone severely mentally ill in the past.

To this, she started directly messaging me even though I was telling her boyfriend those points. She called me a whore, slut, pick me, all because I was talking to her boyfriend when she is not okay with it. I have never formally met her before.

I feel like this is something for them to discuss. I have never flirted with her boyfriend, we have never called nor played with each other one-on-one. Our friendship is respectful and is held together by mutual interests in gaming. 

I eventually cut him off when I realized that our friendship and his relationship could not co-exist.

A couple months later, he asked if we could be friends again. I agreed but quickly retracted it as his girlfriend had started harassing me almost immediately. I told him very specifically that we could not be friends unless they were not together.

When he broke up with her because he felt suffocated, I allowed him back into my life with the condition that he blocks me immediately if he gets back with his ex. He agreed.

He blocked me a week ago and I have not made any attempts to contact him. Today, I received a message from his girlfriend on an alt account calling me horrible things and telling me to commit basically.

I did not respond nor have I ever responded with hurtful things.

Was talking to her boyfriend without her permission so wrong?

","I (17M) have been suffering emotionally for 4+ months due to a situation.



Said situation being:



For 8 months, I had a crush on V (17F). My social skills are lacking, so, I never knew how to move forward with her. In hindsight, I should’ve gotten closer with V. I recognise the fact that I didn’t get anywhere with V is no one’s fault but my own.



N (18M), who then was my best friend, was aware of this. One day he messaged her. They got close, fast. This made me uncomfortable, I called him out for it, he kept lying to me. Eventually the situation exploded. He told her I liked her. He liked her too.



I was really hurt, he had betrayed me, and he been manipulated and had gaslit me.



Then they got together. It was unbelievable. It didn’t get better from there either. N then spent two weeks blaming me for everything *(to be fair, I ain’t no goody-two-shoes. Before the situation exploded, I was so frustrated, I become rude towards him, but it’s not close to comparable)* and slandering me.

----

I could’ve been okay. But I’m not. N wasn’t just awful to me, but he’s also just a terrible person overall, he’s consistently manipulative. Particularly, he was extremely toxic to his ex *(V used to hate him for this. Turns out she now she says N's actions weren’t so bad because he was drunk, a view she used to reject.)* Yet, after being such a moral degenerate, N's suffering no accountability.



No one trusts N but everyone still considers him a friend. This is crippling me. I can’t even be around N without having an anxious breakdown. It feels like he gets away Scott free while I get to go fuck myself.



Sometimes nasty people don’t pay for their actions, but I don’t get it this time. These folks are my friends, as far as I understand, they’re meant to stand up for me. I was treated like crap and betrayed to the point it’s driving me nuts. I’m not just saying it either, I have evidence in the flesh, literally, it’s gotten so bad I have been writing insults on my arms. *(The self-hate from the regret of having done nothing & the feeling of worthlessness of being worth less than someone awful don't help)*



I’ve spoken to them, most of them give me pity & listen to me and ""sympathize"". But that’s all it amounts to. They tell me they don’t care., or that they’re friends with N so they need to be neutral.

  
I’m tired of being told to ""move on"", ""forgive N for your own/everyone's good"" or ""you're choosing to stay miserable."" My brain has no off switch. Seeing no justice, when I feel my friends have the full ability to enforce it, is so invalidating and makes me feel worthless. I know they've got their own lives & concerns, but is it normal they're not inherently troubled by the pain N consciously put me through?



I could be TA because maybe I’m just deluding myself because I want to be right so badly. Or I keep saying I'm the victim of this situation. Maybe I'm deluding myself into thinking I did nothing wrong like a narcissist.

105,1g8gwwk,AITA for asking a driver to move their car after they finished filling up with gas?,"I pull up to the last pump at the gas station.  It was broken. I notice there are some orange traffic cones a few feet away that must have been blocking access to the pump, but somebody moved them.  I look around, and the place is pretty packed.  Out of 16 pumps or so, there are maybe 1 or 2 free, and people are coming in and out frequently.  I figure if I try to back up and go to another one, someone else might get there first and I'll have to drive around again, no biggie but annoying... when I notice that the person at the pump directly in front of me has been sitting in their car and not pumping gas for the whole time I've been there.   I figure it's easier to pull forward twenty feet than back up and drive around to another row of pumps.  

So I walk up and ask if they are done pumping.  The woman says ""yeah,"" but is otherwise just browsing on her phone.  I ask if she would mind moving up ten feet or so so I could use the pump.  She says ""No, I'll move when I am ready to.""  I say ""awww come on, nobody can use the pump if you stay there, just pull up a bit.""  She rolls up her window and ignores me.  I stand there for a few seconds not believing the audacity of the woman, then say loud enough that she can hear me through the glass ""You are a terrible person.""

Then I go over to the attendant's booth and ask if she knows the pump is broke and if I can put the cones back to stop other people from pulling up to it.  The attendant says ""go for it"", but is confused about the question, and follows me back to my car.  She's fifteen feet behind me, and watches me replace the cones.  At this point, the attendant is literally next to the woman's car who won't move.  So, I ask her, ""Could you ask this person to pull up so I can use the working pump?""  She looks at the woman, who rolls her window down, and asks ""Are you ok?"".  The woman in the car says she's fine.  So the attendant asks... ""Can you please move up?""  The woman acts annoyed, sighs, but moves up.  I say ""thank you"" to the attendant, get in my car, drive up the twenty feet, and begin pumping gas.

Shortly thereafter, an unrelated woman drives up and says ""You know, that happened to me too, but I didn't make a scene about it.""  I said, ""I don't think it's making a scene to call out inconsiderate people, I think she made the scene by refusing to move after she was done.""

106,1g8gdhx,AITA for not knowing what to do about this?,"Hi reddit, this is my first post so I hope this isn’t too wordy. I (16f) am part of a student leadership team at school. My boyfriend (17m), one of my close friends we’ll call M (17f), and my boyfriend’s best friend E(17M) are in charge of the student leadership group. E is dating a girl, A (18f) who I was close to for a few months last semester, but we just gradually stopped talking. This is because she would tell me all of these things M would supposedly say about me (me and M didn’t start talking really until July) and they were honestly terrible. It was all very personal attacks and things of that nature. It came out that M didn’t say any of this stuff, and it was actually A. A tried to twist it and blame M but there was proof that she said this. So, I digress. 

We had an evening practice recently where E’s parents came to the school and spoke with our teacher. They basically said that me and M were bullying E. Our teacher asked for an example of what me and M did, because that’s very out of character for us both, especially because I was bullied essentially last year, and they only cited one event. This event was a miscommunication in which me and E talked out in a mediated discussion later. 

So, me and M both obviously felt terrible because she’s very close to E’s little sister and his family. They blamed her significantly more than they blamed me. The issues come in here. Basically, my boyfriend obviously was worried about his best friend and checked on him and asked for his side of everything. E basically said that A had told him that me and M had said all of these terrible things about him and that we hated him. 

I’m a very honest person, if I hated him I’d still be respectful but he’d know I didn’t like him so this made no sense to me. So my boyfriend pried a bit more into the situation and found out that 

A had told E he couldn’t rely on anyone but her and had nobody but her
A had told E’s parents that me and M were bullying him, he didn’t even tell them that
And that A has been isolating E for months and won’t really let him have friends outside of her

So this is where I’m wondering if I’m the AH. Our teacher is elevating this claim to the district because she’s concerned that A will ruin me and M’s reputation and continue to lie about us, and she’s worried the situation will get manipulated more. I’m wondering if I'm actually insane and not realizing that I’m the issue in this scenario. I feel like I had to have done something to warrant this level of accusations to be leveled against me. My dad feels as if A is trying to pick on me and M and is targeting us, and that’s also what our teacher said but I know my dad is biased and A was very rude about the situation to our teacher when they spoke so I just wanted to know if I’m just jaded and the AH and if so, why and how to fix it I guess.

Well since then they've alternated between being shitty roommates (dictating new apartment rules work no room for discussion,  everything decided ""democratically"" by a couple who agree on everything) and being pretty helpful, giving me rides and losing me money a few times, which i repaid every time. Well fastforward to last week when my lawyer calls and informs me that i will be getting a lot of money, (enough to pay call for a used car and do a few other important things)
Well,  when Greg gets the news, he says in what i read as a jovial tone,  ""oh good you can get me a PS5"" 
I reply jokingly, because i thought he was joking,  ""no but you can watch me play mine""
A couple days Later, Freda messages me about how hurtful it is that i was flippant about getting him a PS5 and how when he split with his ex, and later got a windfall he spent 1/3 of it ($1000) getting her a car,  and a PS5 would be a much smaller portion of my settlement and so i should buy him a Playstation.

109,1g8fsz0,AITA For Not Budging on the Birthday Party Date?,"I (19F), have my birthday coming up on November 15th, which is the date I want to celebrate it at our apartment. However, one of my roommates Sherry's (19F) birthday is on November 20th, and she wants to celebrate her birthday on the 15th at the apartment as well. 

Here's where the problem is. Neither of us want to do our birthdays on any other date. Sherry originally called the 16th (that Saturday) and then I called 15th, but she's changing her mind because she wants a table at this popular club and it happens to be more expensive on the 16th ($1000 vs $300). She doesn't want to do her birthday party on the 14th (that Thursday) because she has work, and then she doesn't want to do it the weekend after because she has a test on Friday, and then she'll go home to celebrate with her family. She also has a friend from out of town coming on the 15th.

I want my party to be on the 15th because I have multiple friends from out of town coming (meaning I can't celebrate it on Thursday since they'll have school), and I don't want to celebrate it on the 16th either because there'll be a home football game at our college on that day, meaning every bar will be packed. I technically could do it on another weekend, but I don't want to since it's my birthday, and she hasn't been the best roommate overall. 

Some context about Sherry: (This is coming from me as well as my two other roommates who live with her): This is a four person apartment and there's four girls, but Sherry shares her room with her boyfriend, who lives with her. This was agreed upon before by us, but it's probably against the apartment rules. Sherry and her boyfriend are always up at night watching TV super loud and having people over every other weekend (drinking), which me and my two other roommates have been annoyed with, but the few times we've said something about it they've ignored it, so we've sort of just been dealing with it.

I feel bad because me and Sherry were actually starting to become friends, and it genuinely seems like she can't do any other date in that 2 week span, but she's been trying to convince me to give the date to her and being really pushy about it, which I don't exactly appreciate.

Here's where the problem is. Neither of us want to do our birthdays on any other date. Sherry originally called the 16th (that Saturday) and then I called 15th, but she's changing her mind because she wants a table at this popular club and it happens to be more expensive on the 16th ($1000 vs $300). She doesn't want to do her birthday party on the 14th (that Thursday) because she has work, and then she doesn't want to do it the weekend after because she has a test on Friday, and then she'll go home to celebrate with her family. She also has a friend from out of town coming on the 15th.

I want my party to be on the 15th because I have multiple friends from out of town coming (meaning I can't celebrate it on Thursday since they'll have school), and I don't want to celebrate it on the 16th either because there'll be a home football game at our college on that day, meaning every bar will be packed. I technically could do it on another weekend, but I don't want to since it's my birthday, and she hasn't been the best roommate overall. 

Some context about Sherry: (This is coming from me as well as my two other roommates who live with her): This is a four person apartment and there's four girls, but Sherry shares her room with her boyfriend, who lives with her. This was agreed upon before by us, but it's probably against the apartment rules. Sherry and her boyfriend are always up at night watching TV super loud and having people over every other weekend (drinking), which me and my two other roommates have been annoyed with, but the few times we've said something about it they've ignored it, so we've sort of just been dealing with it.

I feel bad because me and Sherry were actually starting to become friends, and it genuinely seems like she can't do any other date in that 2 week span, but she's been trying to convince me to give the date to her and being really pushy about it, which I don't exactly appreciate. So, I don't know if I should give the date to her. AITA?",0.0,0.9659642577171326,1,0
110,1g8fs87,AITA for imposing Quiet hours,"I'm on mobile, forgive the poor formatting. Throwaway for obv. reasons.

I, 19, have lived with my roommate, 19, for a bit over/around 2 months. We live in government quarters, I met them once while I was finishing some medical treatment and moved in because they needed to not be alone and I was the only person of the same sex they were comfortable living with.

I would like to preface what I am about to say with the following: As a person, I adore my roommate. They are a wonderful friend and I'm sure they're a wonderful partner to their new spouse (30) and I want nothing but the best for them. I do not hate them!!!

However.

They just returned from leave and unfortunately the first thing I did when I saw them, after more than 6 hours of studying (I'm an idiot and didn't do my hours responsibly) this afternoon/evening was blurt out that I did not want any phonecalls in our room after 10pm on school nights. I had waffled on this for several days, and gotten the opinion of 11 of my peers to see if I was being unreasonable . They said no.

This is something that was brought up about a month ago, and for a while, I thought our proposed solution of headphones was working fine. Sure, their headphones would die every two or so nights and I would often awaken to the sound of their spouse's work sounds (The door at their spouse's work comes across horrendously loud. It's not their fault) but I thought it was better than before, and while I was still falling asleep in class and stuff, I thought it was okay.

And then they went on leave, and I had quiet, and I slept GREAT. I wasn't falling asleep in class as much, I was focused, and even though I felt overly burnt out (Work is hard and I hate studying in the building) I felt much happier.

So, in terms of timing, I know I am the asshole. But my question is if what I'm asking for makes me an asshole.

I requested, no, I demanded, that, except for emergencies, there would be NO phone calls/face time/vc in our room past 10pm on nights preceding a school night. If they wanted to talk to their spouse/anyone, they get dressed and go outside to do it, or they go downstairs to the common lounge where there is free, semi-reliable wifi and do their thing down there.

I was firm and did not budge on this.

They asked if it was even for going to sleep, I said yes. No phone calls after 10pm on school nights. They could have peaceful nature sounds playing, that is one thing, but no more phone calls post 10pm.

I shot down their suggestion of headphones, because we've been doing that, and while it works okay, it's not the most reliable.

They protested for a few more minutes, and where I'm probably the AH is that I said I didn't care, no phone calls past 10pm on school nights. Weekends, I don't care.

Further context: I am in class, they aren't. They're on the phone w/ spouse what seems every second they have their phone, they're in the room more than me.

111,1g8fk2z,AITA for making my step sister leave her room while she takes a call if I’m in there? ,"A little background (a lot lengthier of a post than i intended here) 
I (24) as of this year have lived on my own since I was 17, In the last 5 years I have had very bad bouts of mental health issues and decided with my mental health and financial instability because of it that It would benefit me to move in with a roommate so that’s what I did. 

Fast forward to March of this year I moved in with a roommate for the first time since 17. Albeit not in the greatest area but it was within my price range and it worked for what I needed. My mom on the other hand hated that the area I lived in was unsafe and was requesting i find somewhere else or come home after finishing her basement.

Well… long story short i put in that i wouldn’t be renewing my lease to the date my mom gave and came home unfortunately the basement never got done so I have been having to sleep in my old room which is now my step sisters room it’s a double mattress bed so there’s a second pullout bed under the primary bed. 

Now this has been talked about in length and everyone in the house knows what the sleeping arrangements are.

So now I’m back home where her husband and his two kids my step brother 15(m) and step sister18(f) now sharing her room (only to sleep in which i make it a point to keep all my things in a dresser in the downstairs living room and only go in her room when i have to sleep)

So now comes the issue I have been having, when I go to try to sleep she decides it is the perfect time to FaceTime her boyfriend, aunt etc so each time I had been half asleep she goes turns on the brightest light and puts her call on speaker and has a full volume conversation and just really inconsiderate to the situation. 

Hoping it was occasional i didn’t say anything but it kept happening so i brought it up we talked and i thought the issue was resolved, but next day it happened again and i work 7a-7p did not have the energy to be argumentative so I decided to leave and spend the night at a friends. I went to let my mom know that I was gonna head out and she was surprised and concerned and asked why and so I let her know the issue and that I didn’t want to argue or cause any issues so ill remove myself (she did not like that and told me not to go anywhere)

I am not sure what she told her but i know the gist was to leave the room for calls if im in there as she would ask me to do if i was the one being inconsiderate i don’t know how she reacted to being told that entirely but i know it was an argument and now she does leave the room for her calls but now my step brother who would engage in conversation now actively avoids me, her husband now is very minutely acknowledging me and my step sister actively ignores me and doesn’t speak to me at all and gives me faces and so I am too tired between working and school to engage , so i have decided out of respect for my mom to just let it go and if they want to ignore me fine but between all the reactions and kind of isolation I’m feeling from them I’m starting to feel a bit of guilt like I should have just sucked it up and not said or done anything AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-21,"AITA for making my step sister leave her room while she takes a call if I’m in there?

112,1g8fcsg,AITA for telling DIL I won’t watch her older kids so she could take the baby on a vacation ,"My son and DIL have 3 kids, 2 girls and a boy. The girls are 3 and almost 1 and her son is 4. I’ve always believed she favors the youngest. With the older two, she was going back to work at 12 weeks, had them in daycare all day every day, didn’t breastfeed, and just seemed disinterested in becoming a parent. It’s night and day with this baby though. She quit her job so the baby wouldn’t be in daycare, she’s into attachment parenting, refused to even try formula for this one, and refuses to go anywhere without her. 

They’re going to move for my son’s job and are taking the weekend to look at houses and explore the area. My DIL asked if I could take the older two and when I asked about the baby, she said the baby would be coming with them. I asked why she was taking the baby and not the older two and she said it would be so much easier. She doesn’t have to worry about the kids running around the stages houses, getting bored after touring 5 houses, getting tired, etc. and that the baby will happily stay in the carrier or in her stroller. She also mentioned that the baby has never been away from her and she doesn’t want to put her through 2 nights away from mom yet. She also wants to take the baby out and she thinks it’ll be easier to check out the kid places with only one kid. 

I refused. I told her that I think it’s favoritism to take one kid on vacation and leave the others at home, especially when she already has a history of treating her better than the other kids. The other kids would love to go on this trip and they won’t understand why their mom left them but brought their sister. 

She says I have no right to criticize her parenting and that she does not have a favorite. I refused to budge and told her I’d take all of them or none. She has a friend watching the older two now and told her that I am not allowed to see the kids this weekend because she thinks I’ll talk about her to the kids and cause problems between her and the kids. 

My son thinks she’s overreacting but he also thinks I shouldn’t have said anything because I know she had ppd with the first 2 and she feels guilty about not being a good mom to the first 2.

I live in my childhood home & my great aunt rents the house next door. We call her Peaches. she's notoriously nosy, always in someone's business, & LOUD. She’s had a key to our house bc while it was vacant, my dad asked her to check on the house.

We’ve had issues ever since I moved back last year of her walking right in the front door wo knocking. After repeatedly asking/telling her to not come in wo a heads up/permission, I thought it was getting better. 
After I got really pissed off about that she apologized and told me she'd never do it again & she ""wanted me to trust her"". Fast forward 2 months & I go out of town with my mom. I have a camera set up pointed at my bed so I can watch my baby and I sleep when I choose to cosleep. Since I only use it for that / monitoring naps, I never have the notifications on. When I got home after the trip, I noticed the camera had shifted. I grabbed my phone to look over the footage. I'm scrolling scrolling and then I see Peaches in my room. She beelines STRAIGHT for my bed, grabs a towel I had hanging & COVERS my camera. Then I hear shuffling and multiple cabinets opening and closing. My room is like a mini apartment with a kitchen and everything. I hear her moving things around and who knows what. About 10 minutes later, she flings the towel off the camera and walks out of the room & leaves.

Then she told me she was looking for the beer I told her she could have from the MAIN kitchen fridge. Then she's like, but I didn't even end up taking the beer. I told her yeah I know they're still the fridge. Why wouldn't you just ask me and I'd say sure go get them?? and she's like well I knew you were out of town ?!? I lay into her and say wtf whywould you think that's okay & if that's true WHAT were you doing going through my stuff?? She couldn't offer a reason and said that she wasn't thinking.

She's the kind of person that needs help with often, like asks for a favor a day. I have always been happy to help her.

Then I find out she's talking shit about me and then THIS. She's like please don't kick me out of my house! I'm not going to kick someone out of their house but it sure is foking unnerving to be living right next to someone with no respect for your boundaries.

My typical bath routine is I’ll give him a light brushing, hose him down, shampoo, rinse, then another brushing. He then runs around the yard to dry off. He’s a lab mix with a short/medium coat, not extremely hairy like some long haired breeds but definitely sheds as most dogs do. 

After I had finished bathing him and he’s rolling around in the grass, my next door neighbor comes out and in an angry voice says to me “you’re littering” I was confused and respond “sorry what?” And he says “you littered dog hair all over my yard”. I look over and can see some dog hair that had floated from my yard onto his yard. Not a ton but if you look for it can see tuffs of hair here and there. In the moment I wasn’t sure how to respond and just said “oh sorry about that” and he replied rudely “wash your dog inside next time” and went back inside. 

The more I think about it though, the more I feel like he overreacted. I suppose it can be annoying to have dog hair on your lawn but it’ll blow away by the end of the day.

116,1g8eiue,AITA For refusing to mitigate my adult children’s arguments and calling my daughter childish for expecting me to?,"(I apologize if I make any mistakes with Reddit, as I am new to this site)



My daughters “Lizzie” and “Maggie” are polar opposites. The girls have never gotten along and forcing them together would only result in fights. I made them to learn to be civil while doing small thing together while being civil, but otherwise made sure they had their space.



Lizzie in particular has always been a headstrong and not afraid to speak her mind. I always tried to teach her about appropriate ways to speak her mind and when/who to have tact with. But, as I said, Lizzie is a very opinionated person nd, even with the counselor’s recommendations, my efforts had little impact.



Lizzie has recently developed a rude attitude towards family. Our family does not find it cute, and most members will simply tell her to leave or not reply back. When I brought it up to her, Lizzie just made statements to the effect of “I’m an adult, I can say what I want.” Because she pays her own bills, there’s nothing more I can do.



Lizzie came calling me recently because she had been making mean comments about Maggie, and Maggie responded by taking a jab at Lizzie. Lizzie claimed her comments were a joke, but Maggie took it too far, her sister can’t be sayig these things, and I should talk to Maggie about it.



I refused and reiterated what I’ve already said before to Lizzie: She’s an adult and can say what she wants. But when you try to start something, don’t be surprised when the other person bites just as hard back. Maybe others would bite their tongues when she was a kid, but people won’t hold back anymore now that she’s an adult.



Lizzie tried to say that Maggie’s comments were out-of-line, but I told her that asking me to get involved is just childish. They’re both living on their own and in their twenties. Far too old for me to be mitigating their arguments like children. If they choose to interact with one another, they need to learn to work out their disputes like adults.



Lizzie is still upset at me, saying Maggie took it too far and what she said was beyond any line. But, as I said, this behavior is childish and both my girls have proven through their careers and independence that they’re above it. Neither are under my roof anymore, and it’s not my responsibility to mitigate their fights anymore. AITA?

",Not the A-hole,2024-10-21,"AITA For refusing to mitigate my adult children’s arguments and calling my daughter childish for expecting me to? (I apologize if I make any mistakes with Reddit, as I am new to this site)



My daughters “Lizzie” and “Maggie” are polar opposites. The girls have never gotten along and forcing them together would only result in fights. I made them to learn to be civil while doing small thing together while being civil, but otherwise made sure they had their space.



Lizzie in particular has always been a headstrong and not afraid to speak her mind. I always tried to teach her about appropriate ways to speak her mind and when/who to have tact with. But, as I said, Lizzie is a very opinionated person nd, even with the counselor’s recommendations, my efforts had little impact.

117,1g8ehtn,AITA for calling my friend dramatic after she wouldn’t stop talking about her illness?,"
I (15F) have a friend (15F) named  Josie who’s in a lot of the same classes, lunch period, and the same extracurricular (marching band). She was sick for about a week and when she came back on Wednesday (last week) all of our friends were super concerned for her because she went to the ER at one point and had a bunch of abdominal pain and body aches and such. One of the biggest side affects was nausea. 

At lunch on Wednesday she refused to eat and spent the whole lunch period talking about how her appetite has gone away and how she gets nauseated whenever she tried to eat and how she lost “7 whole pounds when she was sick and is still loosing more and how she’s only 138 pounds now after being somewhere in the mid 140s” Obviously, everyone in our friend group was acting super concerned for her and trying to find something she would eat and Thursday and Friday followed a similar dialogue. I’m a bigger girl in my friend group, and Josie knows how hard losing weight is for me, so I feel like she just kept bringing it up as a jab at me.

On Friday I snapped and told her that she needed to stop being dramatic about it because her weight loss wasn’t not that serious since she’s a bigger girl just like I am (I’m 2 inches taller at 5’7, and weigh about 30 pounds more than she is currently) and so it’s not as significant as it would be on anyone else. I also told her that she was just trying to seek attention by still talking about her illness and complaining about various side effects (then why are you at school?) she was still experiencing (or “forgetting” to take off her hospital bracelet the first day she was back from her previous er visit two nights before)

Now everybody is calling me out for what I did, they said I basically called her fat and also pushed down her feelings and stuff about her being sick and that I wasn’t being a supportive friend. So AITA for saying her weight loss isn’t that significant and thinking she’s just talking about it for attention?",Asshole,2024-10-21,"AITA for calling my friend dramatic after she wouldn’t stop talking about her illness?

But I’m 22M and I have been dating my boyfriend (19M) for almost a year and a half. We’ve had a really solid relationship and I’ve honestly thought he was the one. He’s a trans male (Female to male for those who don’t know) and he hasn’t wanted to transition for as long as I’ve known him. Over the last few months since about May I found out that he was bringing me along to his birthday trip to Disneyland all expenses paid besides food for 2 days. I was naturally really excited and we’ve been planning what we were gonna do on both days. Recently, about 2 days ago we got into an argument about wether or not we wanted to have kids, he told me that he no longer wanted to have kids himself personally, he would rather adopt or do a surrogacy. I understand the implications that go on for a pregnancy, especially for someone like him. I can’t imagine the dysphoria that would cause for him. We made up and we decided to not speak on the matter until we were both ready to have kids. But since then I haven’t felt the same truly and am asking myself if this conversation gave me the ick. I don’t want to leave him because I do love him, but I feel like if I do it after our trip, it will look like I was just in it for the trip. I need an outside source of thought on this one so please Reddit. Am I the asshole?

119,1g8eebg,AITA for not respecting my boyfriend’s wishes about not getting too wasted and staying the night at a friends house for an upcoming Halloween party? ,"Edit to add the incident on vacation:
To completely understand the situation you need to know that Taylor has bipolar personality disorder. He’s been diagnosed and is on medication. The reason I say this isn’t to defend him, just to bring up the fact that during this incident he was chemically imbalanced, and this is not like his character whatsoever even his lifelong friends said he’s never been like that before. 
The first night there, him, I, Anne and another friend indulged in Molly. We were all good, but Taylor took too much and was just being annoying. The next morning he was off, like he wasn’t acting himself and he ended up having an “episode” it’s a long story, but he ended up calling Emily a bitch. 

He ended up calming down a bit after that, but was still a little worked up and not himself. The true incident happened when we had left to do an activity about an hour later. 

He wanted to take the Molly with us. It was in a water bottle and instead of taking the whole water bottle. I took most of it and left a little bit for after we got back. 

When we got to our destination, we were on a bus with us and everyone else and he asked me where the bottle was. I showed him and he asked if it was all of it. I said no, I left some behind for after and he blew up, grabbed the bottle from me and started chugging, I snatched it back and dumped the rest out of the window. He yelled at me in front of everyone. 

Throughout the rest of the trip he was frantically apologizing to me and everyone else and just put a damper on things. 
___________

A little background, I (30f) became friends with Anne (35f) and her husband (35m) a few years ago. I met my current boyfriend Taylor (35m) through Anne and her husband at a to get together about two years ago but we only started dating this past May. They’ve all been lifelong friends.
About a month ago, we all went on vacation with about five other couples. There was an incident where my boyfriend made an ass out of himself and humiliated me. There was also another incident with a mutual friend (Emily). 
The entire trip was ruined pretty much and everyone was affected by it in someway. I initially broke it off with him on the trip. We all had a great time regardless since the incident happened early on in the trip. 
After we got back home we ended up working through it, and he is still understandably, trying to make things better. It’s been smooth sailing since the vacation and that was the first and last incident like that. 
Every year Anne has a Halloween party, shortly after the vacation Anne’s husband let Taylor know that he was not welcome per Anne’s and Emily’s request. 
Taylor and I talked about this and he made it clear that he still wanted me to go but he would rather me not stay the night there (I typically stay the night there when they have a party or when we’re just hanging out) I didn’t say much about it at the time just said that I did plan on still going. 
Today, Taylor came over to hang out for a little bit. He asked why I haven’t brought up the Halloween party, I said there wasn’t much to talk about and didn’t think he would want to hear about it anyway. 
We talked about it a little bit and we talked about the vacation incident a little bit, and he said well it’s already been decided that you’re not going to get too wasted and that I’m going to drop you off and pick you up. I told him I didn’t think it was fair to put those kinds of restrictions on me when that’s not typically what I do. 
I never get shitfaced, but I will drink enough to where I know it’s not safe to drive and I plan on having a good time that night with my friends. 
I told him I won’t get too wasted because that’s just not like me, but I can’t promise that I will be ready to leave by a certain time. I’ll already be showing up late. 
I know none of this would be an issue if he wouldn’t have fucked up on our vacation and he was invited to the Halloween party this year, I don’t think it’s fair that he puts restrictions on me for that. 
But at the same time, I feel a little bad that I’m still going when he’s not welcome. Am I the asshole?

120,1g8eaqo,AITA Super Awkward Dead Silence Neighbor Situation Apartment ,"I almost didn't post anything because its really not a big deal at all just weird. I live in a large apartment building and am a 34M.

I transferred units in the same building/hall to upgrade to a better unit and a new neighbor moved in around the same time I transferred. His room is right across mine in the hallway so close.

All seemed fine at first i was bringing in grocery bags so my hands were a bit full but i made initial contact by being like ""you are the new neighbor? im so and so"" to make basic contact. He said oh yea and so and such is also here (he had a roomate). As i was holding groceries and on the move I said something like ""oh Im sure ill run into him later! "" and that was that but I tried to be friendly. The guy looked like he was in his 20s.

Next one day the fire alarms go off which is rather normal for false alarms. I open the door and head to the office just to check. he opens the door and I, for the purpose of being friendly say ""oh its pretty normal happens all the time but im going to check"" He says nothing and shuts the door. Don't think much of it at the time.

Then as im going up the elevator i see him approaching with i guess his girlfriend. I'm not expecting a full on convo while hes with his gf but i get the elevator button for him for our floor and say ""i got it"" to be courteous. I get no thank you or acknowledgment or anything lol... We both walk all the way to our rooms and i go into my apartment thinking like ""okay dude...""

Then we cross one time in the hallway. he looks up at the ceiling and says nothing. I don't either because i've made a clear effort to be friendly and acknowledge him it would be time for him to reciprocate.

(I promise im almost done) I go to the apartment gym and then he comes in. I dont say anything to him and nothing to me. I go up literally in front of him to put my dumbells back because i had to (but also a little bit of well f you energy im going to throw the uncomfortableness back on you) he does like 2 sets and leaves lol (exaggerated a little)

then later that evening im sitting with my girlfriend in one of the common amenity spaces eating dinner. he comes in showing his friend the place does a lap and leaves. after his friend goes through the door he turns around and looks at us for like 2 seconds.... lol weirdo. then continues out.

Finally a few weeks later I go to use the elevator and it opens and its just him in there lol. I make and hold eye contact for like 2-3 seconds as i get in the elevator then I face the other way because im not a complete psycho. I think he just looks at his phone. I get out of the elevator first and we just go to our apartments right next to each other lmao. It's the most stupid and silly thing but yet soooooo awkward. Like did i kill this guys cat in my sleep or something? I wouldn't care but its uncomfortable this guy is my closest neighbor. AITAH?

**Edit 1:** *Just to elaborate more after some of these responses. I totally respect the fact that someone does not want to engage in small talk i actually prefer that most of the time. I mirrored his energy and honestly would have been fine hardly talking to him aside from ""hey"" for common courtesy. Dude just went completely to the opposite end and doesnt say a basic thank you if i get the elevator button . Also the turn around and stare was odd that one time. No I don't get spectrum vibes its more superiority complex douche frat guy that just graduated college.

121,1g8ea6v,AITA for possibly getting a teenager fired after talking about her period in front of kids (but that's not the reason) ,"Hi all, 

This is not a major thing, but I'm still feeling like I handled this poorly, and am looking to get out of my head on it. I (27M) teach 4th and 5th graders in a supplemental (weekend) ""school"" setting.  Every teacher is given HS-age (paid, but very little) TAs to help, this year we have way too many (we hire any grad of the program who wants to do it) and I have 5 teens for 11 kids. My boss has explicitly told me that because we have too many he will let any of them go.



 I have 2 HS girls who are really a problem, they distract the kids on tangents, go on their phones (none of us are allowed to use our phones in front of the kids due to the time and place of the school), and if I ask them to lead a small group in an activity they just don't do it. Also if I ask them to go get something or go somewhere they just don't come back. I've talked to them about it and talked to my boss, and they are on thin ice. 



Yesterday, during snack break one of the girls asked me if they both could leave to go to the drugstore to buy pads.  I was pretty sure we had some somewhere in the building and I was not sure what the rules and responsibilities we had about letting the teens leave, especially since I was not sure they would come back. 



This is where I may have started to mess up.

123,1g8dhh9,AITA For not fixing the distance btw my family and I? ,"Long story - growing up my family was all very close. So close I'd say I spent as much time growing up with my cousins as I did with my younger brother. 10 yrs ago I moved with my spouse to a city that's a 4 hour drive away.  The move was initially devastating as I left my close family & friends, but I knew if we'd tried the long distance thing it wouldn't work. 

Things settled, I drove to visit my family AT LEAST once a month (weather permitting). This became even more frequent when my mother's husband was quite ill in the hospital, again when my nephew was young, and my spouses grandmother became ill. Even when I had my daughter & her dad was working shift work, we'd pack up the car, plan potty stops for her and make our way for the 4 hour drive. 

Most of my extended family has NEVER come here to visit, though we'll often coordinate dinner or have them stay the night if they're passing through.   2 years ago I moved 45 min further away from my family due to a change of work for my spouse & myself with a new, more demanding job.   My visits have significantly decreased.  Add to that serious issues with sleep, a long highway drive I don't want to risk when I'm tired, and being perpetually behind on work, I mostly don't have the energy for almost 8 hours of driving crammed into 2 day weekend. 

I'll add here that also 2 years ago we lost 3 close family members all unexpectedly and in rapid succession.   I made MULTIPLE trips even for just the day to be with my family then - I do feel like, when I'm needed, I'm there. 

Now, I don't attend many birthdays, barely make it there for Christmas as I hate driving when the roads are bad, and when I do go, I'm made to feel so guilty by my mom, my closest aunt, even my moms husband-> I should go more. I shouldn't disance myself so much, I need to call them more...Im out of touch w a lot of my friends too (yay introversion 😐), but my mom is so demanding in her expectations of me calling & talking all the time - I just don't have the strength for it.. Then when I DO eek out a few minutes to text her, I get responses like 'did you forget I'm your mother'. Occasionally I consider making the trek after a week of good sleep/low work volume but then I get messages like this and frustration and anger cause me to say forget it. 

 Culturally, she (and in turn I) was raised to respect your parent no matter what & do as you're told. I feel I can't just tell her I'm out of touch because she feels so toxic most of the time. I'm not innocent here, but can't find a balance with how to communicate with her.  It makes it harder still because - due to all the work I did early in and almost daily facetime calls I facilitate between her and my daughter, my kid wants to see her grandma & her cousins.

126,1g8ct90,AITA for asking my father to pay half of my UNI fees when he is paying double for my sister?,"Im posting this because I can't workout whose perspective is correct, 

My parents divorced when I was 12 and for first 2 years everything seemed to be going okay, but after the house had been sold my father became mean when it came to elements around my mother such as refusing to show up to any events with my mother, refusing to allow my sister and I to talk about her within his house, etc. He would also get angry about anything that he disagreed with which made it impossible to speak on your opinion within his house. So when I was 15 I left and stayed with my mother perminatly. Our relationship strained because of this, for a year I would come over to his house every so often for dinner or pop in when I could. We tried therapy together but I felt my opinion never came across.

Now that I'm 18 I'm hoping I can go to a uni and stay in a hall, the same is happening for my younger sister who is going to a private school far from home. However my father initally disagreed to my sister moving and instead wanted her to go to an even more expensive school within our city. It got to the point where family court had to step in and decide and luckly they choose that the school outside of our city ws best.

My father had initally agreed to pay for uni signing a decloration that he would pay for half of my student loan once I had graduated all I needed to do was send him and budget and the contracts, but I was busy that week so Instead sent it about a week after he asked. However when I was looking through the contract it was unfair to my mum as she would have to pay for the other half of the student loan immediatly as the living loan that I'll be using to survive will only account to his side of the money owed. So after finding this out I asked him to split it with my mother as it is unfair towards her and by doing it this way it splits the cost. He said no and said the I'm an adult now and need to act accordingly.

This made me lash out, and say somethings that he needed to hear. I also mentioned that I had a tough year as I had been accused of a sexual assult which I hadn't done and this caused me to loose all of my friends. He then reponsded by saying it just proves that I'm immature, and that he had ""been manipulated by a master"". He then told me that he no longer will pay for uni fees.

he is calling me and my mother narcissists and being extremly avoidant of my mother. I was also called a few things at school so I don't know if that is a trait I have or just opinion. My mother and father split because they couldn't get along. I'm going to call him tonight to try and fix things, I understand that in a way I am using him for money and to be honest I don't really even want a relationship with him not until I have forgiven him as I still hold a lot of anger towards him (for being a shit father). My mother suggested that I just ask to reset and go back to the intial agreement and she'll take on the burden, but I know she won't be able to afford it.

127,1g8cqxj,AITA for not sharing the car with my gf even though she made half of the payments?,"To put you in context, we have been in a relationship for 7 years and have lived together for 6. We have a 1 yo daughter and we bought a car together 4 and a half years ago. The car is on a 5 year plan and although it is only in my name, my gf paid half of the payments. We made a deal before I signed that she would pay half if in return I gave her as many lifts as possible. I upholded my end of the deal and she did too (except when she was in maternity leave but that's fair).

 Now she is getting her driving license and she told me yesterday that she expects to share the car 50/50 with me and I feel like I am somehow being cheated out of my car because yes she made half of the car payments but I have paid alone for gas, tires, oil change,  insurance and plates for almost 5 years. I haven't told her about how I feel yet because I hate conflict and I have no idea how to tell her without sounding like an asshole. I feel like I should have priority on the car. I told her that we should buy a second one but she says it's too expexpensive and I should take the bus instead when she has the car. 

So aita for wanting to have priority on the car even though she made half the car payments?

EDIT: Thank you for your responses and those who kept it civil 🙏
 I have to add a couple things

1- she refused repeatedly to chip in for maintenance and other costs that the vehicle has
2- never once have i refused to travel her anywhere even if it had to cancel plans to do it.
3- I frequently have to wait for her 30min or more so that I can bring her back and forth places
4- i don't mind that she uses the car, it's just that even if it makes it very inconvenient for me because I would have to do over 1.5 hours of bus travel to get to work (25 min for her) she would still take the car if she starts working earlier than me
5- even though she will have her license i really dont mind continuing to travel her on a daily basis

In the end, I will speak with her about splitting the gas and other maintenance cost now that we will share the car but I am still of the opinion that getting another car would be a better idea (and of course we would pay it together). 

Please keep in mind that we actually get along very well and share almost everything in our lives. We take care of each other and she is a great gf and I like to think that I am a good bf.
