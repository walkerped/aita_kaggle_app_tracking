0,1g97182,UPDATE: AITAH for not letting a family member enter pictures I took into a contest under their name?,"this is an update to a previous post found here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ev871x/aitah\_for\_not\_letting\_a\_family\_member\_enter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ev871x/aitah_for_not_letting_a_family_member_enter/)

In case no one read the original here's a TLDR: I had a family member who wanted to enter the photos I took of the Grand Teton's into a local photo contest because I didn't qualify. I don't want to do it and my family thought I was the asshole.

Here's the update. So I took the advise of a lot of the commentors and told my family I wouldn't allow anyone else to enter my pictures under their name, then made sure my family member didn't enter my photos without my permission by attending the contest and threatening to report them if they tried. I've also taken to not sending around any of my pictures without a watermark. I used some of the arguments given in the comments to justify my decision, and while my family still didn't agree, they let it go and stopped pressuring me to send them all the original pictures. I know some people suggested I tell the contest organizers, but I didn't think it was worth going that far. Man, I probably should have.

So, more recently one of my aunts also got into photography and sent around a lot of pictures she took on a vacation to New Orleans. Well, my plagiarizing family member took them and entered them into a contest in the local paper (small town) under her own name and won. The picture was featured in the paper and referenced only her as the photographer along with a quote by her. I don't think the rest of us would have even found out about it if my uncle didn't like to read the paper everyday.

Now my aunt is angry and so is the rest of the family. I am kind of curious if they would have reacted this strongly for me, but it doesn't really matter. At least now my family understands why I reacted as strongly as I did.

EDIT: for everyone saying I should report her to the paper, I would if I thought it would make a difference. Sadly, my family member’s boyfriend is the biggest sponsor for the local paper so I don’t think they’d risk losing his funding.

1,1g9szpk,AITA for siding with one of my friends during an argument? ,"Okay some backstory, I (15f) have a friend group made up of 6 of us, there's 2 members (who I'm gonna refer to as friend a and friend b) who used to have mutual crushes on eachother, but now they aren't friends and I wanna know if I should've stayed out of it. 

So, this all started about a year ago, so August 2023, we were celebrating my friends birthday and I was talking to friend b (13 at the time, f (is trans but I'm not allowed to refer to that, I'll explain layer)) and she confessed she had a crush on friend a (14 at the time, also f) and I was open to it because I was finally getting closer with friend a.

Skip to about June, friend b came out as trans to us all, we were all supportive, calling her the name she wanted us to use and using he/him pronouns. Suddenly, I got a message from friend a asking to vent, she then started venting about how rude friend b was being to her, calling her a lesbian after the both of them had confessed their crushes on eachother. This made friend a uncomfortable because she felt as if it was unfair she was being called a lesbian, as she was being teased by popular kids in our school at the time. I responded and said she was not in the wrong, and she blocked friend b. 

Coming to present time, there has been on and off arguments between the two of them, and friend b said we aren't allowed to refer to her as her preferred name with people who she's not friends with, in which we've all complied and we no longer use the name, and only refer to her as her deadname, which she gets mad one of my friends (g) calls her, but none of us are allowed to call her the other name as we're still friends with friend a. 

I'm sticking with friend a here but I wanna know if I'm in the wrong. This has all been reported to our school and they're doing nothing about it as friend b is no longer attending school because she'd have to sit in the same room as friend a, which she has said to me, and now she's saying everything is friend a's fault, including events that happened to her (including friend a's sa) ",POO Mode Activated 💩,2024-10-22,"AITA for siding with one of my friends during an argument?

2,1g9qe7l,AITA for asking my adoptive parents to be put in respite care? (they made it long term) ,"Me and my brother were adopted at 8 (me) and 5 (brother) At 11 i started my period, after that i was very hormonal and just not okay. Always kicking off and just very mentally unstable. At 12 i basically asked to be put back into care but as TEMPORARY!! Not permanent. It was respite, what i asked for. It was meant to be 3 weeks (a break for me and my adoptive parents). Those 3 weeks basically turned into a year… That year later i was meant to be given an answer if they were going to take me back or not beating in mind for this whole year i spent all my pocket money on my adoptive parents, was so well behaved for a YEAR. Only for them to say they weren’t going to take me back. This destroyed me and it still does. I was dealing with so much as an early teen, my adoptive parents weren’t very loving and even now (I’m 22) they still aren’t. They’re emotionally unavailable. 

I don’t know why i asked to be put into respite care, i was young and stupid and didn’t know what was happening to me, i was so fucking unstable looking back on it. It really upsets me that no one helped me and basically just gave up. To this day they gaslight me saying it was all on me and what i wanted basically. It hurts i feel embarrassed as me being put back into foster care, especially permanently, wasn’t what i wanted. They kept my younger brother even after saying no after that whole year of me being in care. I feel as if when i was out the picture, it’s like they had their perfect little family. It honestly makes me so hurt. I was given a second change at a loving family and they didn’t love me. Even when i was in their care they always favoured my brother over me. 

Personally if i adopted 2 children and one of them asked to be put on respite as a break, i’d feel upset but i’d work with them and try and understand why they wanted that and what i could do to change there way of thinking! Because of they think that then i’m clearly not doing something right!! I need to change my ways. I wouldn’t give up! I certainly wouldn’t leave them hanging for a fucking YEAR! It’s insane. Am i the bad person here? Should i have not asked for that. I just feel as if that 3 week break would have been good, but then I was 12 years old, i was young why was i making that decision alone! It’s so confusing. It’s upsetting i have ptsd from this so this is the first time i’ve spoken up on it. I feel as if i’m the bad guy. My parents never want to address how i felt all those years ago, they make it about themselves even to this day and i’m 22… i still have trauma due to what happened.

He got really angry, swore at me, and called me names. I ignored him and kept delivering mail. Later, when I had to pass his house again, he yelled at me to stay off his property and kept swearing. I tried to deescalate, but he just kept cursing.

5,1g9p2up,AITA for not offering to help pay for my sister?,"I grew up in Chinese American culture (mostly detached from the chinese culture side since I became an adult however). For those who aren't familiar with Chinese culture, there's some expectation that parents supports their kids after they go to college, and the child will support the parents in the future.

My parents are divorced and toxic and neither of them work. They are \~60 years old, so retirement age. They both have about $1million in assets each -- idk if this is relevant, but just throwing it out there.

My sister is about to go to college. She's a top student so there's some expectation she'll end up going to some expensive college where she'd have to pay a significant amount of tuition out of pocket.

I work in tech and make a lot of money compared to the average person. I'm not saying this to brag, but it's relevant to my family's thought process. I keep getting passive aggressive subtle comments from my dad that there's some expectation I help out my sister. I could be overthinking, but here's the thing. My dad cannot communicate assertively and directly. There's always hidden meaning behind what he asks. If he wants something, he won't directly ask for it, so growing up I learned to never take anything he says at face value, and he has not changed in that regard.

I'm 95% sure he has this expectation given my conversations with him, but he's refusing to directly state it (the 5% uncertainty is me overthinking).

I was thinking of just telling him to straight up he needs to communicate directly with me about what he wants, or we're just not going to talk at all. I'm tired of these BS mind games he plays.

Regardless of what he says, I don't want to support my sister financially. I've paid for a lot of vacations for her and my dad already. I've not expected any ""thank yous"" but lately I realized I've bought and paid for them a lot, and have never received a ""thank you"" or a ""I appreciate you.""

Regardless, don't want to continue support them in any way going forward. It's not my responsibility. Imo, the amount of money I make is irrelevant. If my parents want to support her financially, they can do it, but it's not my responsibility.

This is probably a cultural dependent opinion, but what do you all think? To add nuance to the answer, does the amount of money I make affect your answer?

6,1g9owuc,AITAH for doing couple-y things during a group holiday?,"I went on a group holiday this summer. 11 of us rented an AirBnB. 5 couples, 1 solo. We’ve been friends for a few years and half the group went on a group trip the previous year. 

I am not into doing group activities ‘fulltime’. Before the trip, I (F30) told 2 friends, F (F31) & L (F31), I was feeling anxious because I thought there might be pressure to constantly do group activities and that I couldn’t keep up. I said I wanted to feel free to do things separately with my GF. Both F & L told me that would be fine and at the previous group trip, people “did their own thing”. E.g. F skipped a group day to read her book. 

The holiday incredible and I loved it! BUT, I didn’t spend all my time with the group. On day 1, I was hungry and wanted to eat dinner early so I went with my GF to a restaurant and had dinner while the rest chilled poolside. The gang joined us and we had dessert while they had dinner. When our dessert and their dinner was over, GF and I went to bed and left the group there. Similar things happened over the next few days, my GF and I aren’t big partiers and those friends are. So we were always the first to leave dinner (we wanted to go on morning hikes and runs). One time we visited another region and after spending the day there, we left back to our region for dinner while the group chose to stay. I would say we were a ‘whole’ group at least 2 out of 3 meals every day. 

When my GF and I wanted to do something different, I would see if anyone else wanted to join. Some people would show interest but once it was clear that the WHOLE group wouldn’t join, they would back out. In the end, it was just me and my GF doing these outside activities. On the last day, 3 of them joined us for a pancake breakfast. In the 5 day trip, this was the only occasion that the group split up (outside of me and my GF). That afternoon, I noticed quite a few couples break away from the group to go on walks etc. 

When we got back, I met up with F and asked her to talk. She was hostile during the trip, making mean comments to me, so generally I avoided her. In our talk she said I was “selfish” and that I was “never” with the group and only with my GF. She said if I’m not prepared to join all group activities, I shouldn’t go on a group holiday. When I said I was a bit different to the group when it comes to partying etc she said I knew that before the trip and shouldn’t have come if I couldn’t fit in. I said it sounded like something more to do with her than me because I couldn’t ruin her trip by not being around. She disagreed and said she wasn’t the only one with issues. L has confessed she found it difficult but because her social anxiety means for her there is a script in social situations and when I broke that script it made her uncomfortable. I’m hurt by what F said and I can’t get it off my mind so I would like to hear from the internet.

Just not safe for guests at the moment, I trust my fmsily member to be careful. I don't trust guest and I don't want them getting hurt in our home 


Also her friends already said they didn't really want to do anything.

I have two kids and they are a year apart. My oldest is very outgoing and it quite popular, she is a sophomore. My youngest is a freshman and is the opposite of her sister. She has two friends and usually sticks to herself.

The issue is Halloween. My oldest has gotten invited to two house parties and my youngest hasn’t been invited to any.

My oldest plans on going to the parties and she bought her costume yesterday. My youngest was upset since she didn’t have something to do that day. She asked if she could join her older sister to one of the parties and my oldest told her no.

This is where my husband and I differ. He wants to make my oldest to take her to one of the parties and I am not going to force our oldest 

This resulted in an argument and I told my husband and youngest our oldest won’t be forced to take her. My youngest isn’t talking to me and my husband things I am favoring our oldest. My oldest doesn’t want to take her sibling so she is happy with me

Just not safe for guests at the moment, I trust my fmsily member to be careful. I don't trust guest and I don't want them getting hurt in our home 


Also her friends already said they didn't really want to do anything.

yesterday, i had to call again for the door lock, and he came and opened it. he always makes some small talk and im too anxious to not continue chatting, but i thought it was a fairly normal interaction and he asks if i want him to replace the deadbolt he drilled into the last time. i tell him i can't afford it, assume that's it, and then he leaves. 

this is where it gets sketchy, he texts me afterwards ""nice to meet you again"" like he texted me after the first time but i never responded as i was busy. i text back, ""thanks!"", and suddenly he asks if id like for him to replace my lock for free. i was slightly taken aback and asked ""are you sure?"" as i definitely couldn't afford it but would feel safer with the deadbolt, to which he says of course, do you know why? and makes me guess why he wants to help me. this was probably the point i should have told him never mind but i honestly did t think he meant harm. english is not his first language

he asks to come now, which i said sure as i was home, but then asks if he can bring me food which i was definitely not okay with and politely declined. he arrives, starts fixing my door and asking me questions about what i do for work etc, i'm actually more sketched out and concerned at this point so i redirect and ask about him. he tells me he doesn't have a wife and doesn't live with family, and then all about the band he's in and says i should come watch him play sometime, to which i decline, which he doesn't accept (???). he insists that i should play with them sometime and i say oh..... maybe, since i don't want to confront him. as i leave and say sorry i have plans, he continues to say we will keep in touch and chat, talk to you soon etc 

he texted me ""good morning. how are you"" this morning, which i didn't want to respond nor know how to respond. he followed it up in the afternoon with ""i texted you good morning but you didn't respond. sad face.  have a good night"" 

i am so so so uncomfortable but i don't know what to do. i don't want to respond, but what if he is just a lonely old guy? but what if he's dangerous and now he knows my address and how to get into my apartment?

9,1g9oc8i,AITA For Telling Off A Rude Customer? ,"I went out today with a couple friends of mine for drinks at a café. There was only one employee behind the counter and it was pretty busy since it was lunch hour. Some woman had come up to the counter and started berating the employee about being slow and having to wait about fifteen to twenty minutes for her drink and I told her “lady, you need to be patient with her, she’s the only one here doing orders.” The woman kept telling me how she had to wait and while I understood, I also used to work in customer service so I also understood the other side with how mean customers could be and this girl who looked pretty young was just taking whatever that woman said to her. 

The girl working behind the counter was appreciative of what I said and I told her I used to work customer service so I understood completely how she must’ve been overwhelmed with the amount of orders coming in. My friends however thought that I was attacking the other woman and kept telling me I should have minded my own business and I had no say in it. I didn’t want to just stand by and let her keep talking rudely to that worker though and my friends went on to say I was out of line for even getting involved and I should have been more respectful. 

Now I’m the bad guy in their eyes and I’m just wondering am I the asshole? Should I have handled it differently or not handled it at all? I just feel like if you had been waiting a while instead of being confrontational with a worker you could have just asked nicely since it was rush hour where your drinks were at.

10,1g9o76m,AITAH for cancelling a trip in favor of my friends,"Sorry if the post is a bit badly written, it's my first post, and English is not my first language.

I (15m) just recently got in a big argument with my mother. This upcoming weekend I was supposed to go on a scout trip to another city. But about two weeks before the trip my friend announced that he was going to have a sleepover at his house with all of my friends in the occation of his birthday and also him moving out. When I heard of this, I really wanted to go there.

The problem is that i forgot to tell my mom, and the time when I could just drop the scout trip ran out. When i first told my mom that i didn't want to go, I only told her that it was becuase I had been really tired the last couple of weeks, wich I had, and I didn't want to go. My mom is kind of strict when it comes to politeness, therefore I was a little afraid of her reaction when I told her the main reason i didn't want to go. When i finally built up the courage to tell her, her reaction was pretty much what i expected. She said that of course I could stay home if I am tired, but then I can't go to my friends sleepover. I kinda don't see why. There is a small cansellation fee, but I have offered to pay. One of her other arguments is that I need sleep, but i think it would be good for me also to be with my friends. It's not the sleep that making me tired(i get about 7-8 hours every nigth).

I feel like I am probably the asshole for not telling her earlier, and still expecting that she let me go, but the thing is, I have never cancelled anything like this before. Also I think that i could be the butthole for not telling the whole truth abouy why I didn't want to go at once.

Me and Steve had just gotten back from doing a pool job because Kim was sick. I’ve helped them multiple times and never gotten paid for any of them. No big deal, it only would have been $50 per pool anyways and I work another job where I make more. Steve took Kim to the urgent care and I took care of their dogs till they got back. Gunner who is 3 yrs old and Zoey who is 15 yrs old. Zoey has no mobility in her back legs. Everytime she wants in, I help her up and into the house. I care for both of the dogs and I’ve bought them toys, food, and treats tons of time.

Well, they get back and Steve’s grandson Daemon and his wife Maddie come to visit. Maddie is pregnant and Steve gave them a stroller he got them and baby crib. Me being nice I took it out to Maddie’s car and loaded it up. Zoey is on the porch, and I open the door and go to help her in. The door slips off my arm and taps her front shoulder. Kim comes around the corner and starts yelling. I tell her I didn’t mean to, she doesn’t care. I get zoey in, grab my phone, keys, and I peel out of their driveway because I am done with all their negativity.

12,1g9n7bc,AITA for telling my brother he betrayed mom so why would he get half of everything?,"My mom died a few months ago and she left my brother (40s) some money but I (40sf) got most of what she owned.

Some background to explain why mom did this and why my brother is angry: My mom was an only child for 16 years and she always wanted to get involved in her dad's business. But he didn't want a girl/woman taking over the family business. He was determined to have a son one way or another and even though mom was prepared to leave school and work for him, by the time her brother came along he made it very clear that even if there was no son he would never let her work for him and take over one day. He would rather see the business close. This destroyed my mom. She loved her parents and felt so rejected.

Mom's dad didn't get his way, however, because her brother wanted nothing to do with the business and refused to even work for him let alone take over. My mom was estranged from her dad for many years because her dad made it painfully clear to her that he didn't value a daughter and never would so mom stepped back. But when he heard mom had a son he reached out and when that didn't work he waited until my brother was 18 and he offered him a job and the chance to run the family business. My mom was shocked and my brother told her she better not tell him not to accept because he didn't like the fact she kept us from our grandfather and prevented him running the business with the estrangement. Mom and him had a talk, she said she did not want him to grow up with the same disregard for women as her dad. He basically told her to go and fuck herself and he went to work for her dad.

Years passed and he regretted the strain between him and mom and dad was disgusted with him too. He reached out after dad died and apologized and told mom he loved her. But things were never the same and he talked about her dad like he was some amazing hero of a guy. Which was so difficult for my mom.

So apparently when mom had her will made, she decided that I should get the most and my brother should get something but not an equal share given he had the business and seemed perfectly okay with her being shut out of it for being born the wrong sex.

My brother is hurt and angry about this now that she's gone. He asked me how she could've done this and why I'm not angry. I told him he betrayed mom so why would he get half. He tried to say he didn't but I told him he went to work for her dad anyway and then basically told her to go fuck herself and even when they reconciled he acted like the father who treated her like shit was some amazing person who needed his praises sang all the time. He said I was shitting on him for no real reason.

Even worse one night while I was walking back to the apartment it ran from behind bushes startling me and alerting my dog the combo of which caused me to drop the leash and he chased it up a telephone pole which granted I should have had a tighter grip but there’s a couple dog owners around here who just open their apartment door and let their dog run out to pee (which I also find irresponsible but Im learning to pick my battles)

Addressing some of the comments: 

“I doubt you’d feel bad if the cat suddenly “stopped” showing up”:
If the cat died no. I have no connection to this cat and having had outdoor cats as a kid in the country Im well aware how common it is to never see them again.

Which is why I keep my cat inside and why I want their cat inside so if Im not paying attention and go to the dog park and it was sleeping somewhere and he sees it first I could not live with that guilt and I know the other dog owners feel the same way.

“Cats should be allowed free roam”:

Sure, just know it’ll die early and would have killed many lives before that. Hope you can live with that guilt.

Also, the cat regularly frequents the fenced dog park and that is a huge problem even if it wasn’t the barking the sheer guilt any of us would feel if we missed the cat and it ended up in a fight or death.

The day my ex and I broke up he was calling me a pig saying how im so messy and according to my roommate went as far to FaceTime his friends to show them my mess and ask if they would be okay living like this. For reference, my mess was a shirt that had accidentally fell out of the laundry basket, a plate and a bowl on the arm of the couch, 2 drink bottles, and a book I was reading. There were also 2 pots in the sink that I was soaking at the time.

I’m currently at my parents house because I have the week off school, and before I left I was sweeping and mopping. I got to the kitchen and had to literally scrub the floors because of how much sauce and food was stuck to them. I don’t eat super often and when I do it’s normally pre packaged foods, so while I’m not going to say I didn’t contribute to the floors I don’t believe majority of the disgusting mess was mine.

This got me thinking about how I was called messy by both of them. I am the one that cleans the bathroom, scrubs the kitchen sink, the oven, the fridge, rinses the garbages, washes the windows. Pretty much every household chore that isn’t personal such as washing dishes is put on me since genuinely if I don’t do it, it doesn’t get done. Before my roommate left to go home she kept asking me to wash the tub because it was gross and genuinely was not showering instead of just doing it herself. I did not clean the tub before I left.

So this leads me to my question, if I was to call the both of them out on the fact they have been calling me a slob yet I am the sole person responsible for all the chores, WIBTA ?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-22,"WIBTA if I called out my roommates  So I (F19) currently live with my best friend (F19) and my ex boyfriend (M20)

16,1g9mk1a,AITA Played my fiancee in chess for iPhone location and she lost,"When we first started dating, we exchanged locations because she asked for it so we could build trust and I agreed bc i have nothing to hide. Time goes by and it seems the location caused more issues than trust. Well yes it did build trust, she knows I’m a man that goes straight from work to home and don’t deviate anywhere but there’s still doubt that she has. The issues I see are that she obsesses over my exact location, I’ll be home working on my car (organizing my trunk, cleaning work equipment etc) in the apartment building complex garage and I’ll get a text “you must you prefer being in your car instead of coming up to me” 
Or “I see you got home and decided to walk your dog instead of coming upstairs to give me love”  “I see you went to McDonald’s” “you haven’t left home to go to work yet?” 

Some of these comments, annoying me because I feel controlled specially, when there’s a perfect, good reason for why I do what I do. I always have a good reason and she says oh OK. 

Recently we argued and she mentioned that she doesn’t trust me so I got angry and said well if you don’t trust me then I’m removing the location because then what’s the point, which I did. No she only mentioned that because sometimes she says things she doesn’t mean, but that’s the point I’m trying to make, to show her not to say things she doesn’t mean because there’s consequences. 

I have no problem, giving her my location, but the reason she wants my location is so she can obsess about about my exact coordinates. She says she wants my location so she can know where I’m at in case something happens to me like an emergency situation. i’m 29 years old nothing has ever happened to me and my mother has never asked me for my location so I don’t find that excuse good enough. 

Early in our relationship, she taught me how to play chess so she has way more experience than me and I’ve only really played against her . She challenged me to a game of chess and the winner gets what they want. she assumed she would win since I had never won a game against her. I told her if you lose… you lose my location forever!! or until we have kids..
 I didn’t think I would beat her in chess..  Last night she put the out the chessboard and well I’d beat her pretty bad and obviously she’s upset about it and she still requesting my location.. I told her baby love you need to keep your word, you’re the one that challenged me, you’re the one that pulled out the chessboard and now you don’t like the results that’s not my problem, you need to keep your word. 

Am I the asshole for removing my iPhone GPS location and now denying her that privilege since she lost fair and square? 

Btw those who play chess, I beat her so bad that she refused to shake my hand when she had no moves left and continued the game till the only piece on her board was a king. I had check mate in nine moves after she made a mistake but I strung her along till the end giving her a chance to beat me.

18,1g9m47b,AITA for telling a friend her boundaries are a bit strong?,"So I have a friend that has a 9 month old. Our friend group were really excited for when she was pregnant and when she gave birth we were checking in and bringing her food but as my friend started naming her boundaries a lot of people in our friend group decided to take a step back in order to not agitate her because a few of us broke her rules before we were made aware of them and she got really upset to the point of cursing us out. Now my friend is complaing about us not being there for her like we are for each other kids (everyone in the group has kids under 4). 

Examples of boubdaries -

1. Don't call her baby my baby 
2. Don't hold her baby
3. Don't talk directly to her baby face because you might spread germs to the baby.
4. Don't buy anything outside of the wishlist

She doesn't like people touching her baby and she doesn't feel comfortable with us talking to her over her crib (this boundaries were told to us when the baby was below a month old) so it kind of hard to connect to her child when we can't really smother him with some love. And I respect boundaries for other peoples kids including her kid but I think people are kinda of not wanting to come and relieve her of stress because she is not really giving them opportunities to bond with her child. I told her that the way she is feeling is valid and there is truth to what she is saying but I also mentioned that her boundaries kind of come of as abit strong and we are kind of afraid of doing something wrong because of the way she has behaved when we visit. (She is gets stressed and curses us out, me and the girls are trying to have patience but sometimes it can be really hurtful). For example I visited the other and I was calling her baby cute and she told me not to comment on her looks so that comment kind of created a awkward atmosphere and before that she told me I couldn't visit with my toddler. At this point in time I think me and the friend group prefer to interact with our friend rather than my friend and her baby. This conversation happened in a groupchat.

She basically didn't understand where I was coming from and basically thought I was shiting on her as a mom.

19,1g9lr2t,AITAH? Husband Won't Move,"My husband, my preschool aged daughter, and I live in a large metropolis.  Our area is nicer, but still not the safest, and the Public Schools just aren't it.  As our daughter approaches school age, I have started to think about moving.  I want to move back to my hometown, a small rural town North of us by about 30 minutes.  I work from home, so the move doesn't affect my work situation.  However, my husband owns a business that is located downtown.  I want to move so that our daughter can be safe, go to a better school system, and live a wholesome life in a small town, like I did.  His only argument is his drive time to his business, which would be about 35 minutes each way.  However, because of this he absolutely refuses to move, even when I offer a closer location that is still in a better school system.  Am I the ass hole here?

Pros to Moving

* Better schools
* No break ins next door (happening all the time)
* No shootings (happening all the time)
* Ability for her to have friends in the town nearby rather than spread out across a huge city
* Cheaper mortgage
* Less property taxes
* Closer to my dad who lives alone and recently had a quadruple bypass and neck surgery, currently isn't working
* Closer to my mom who watches her weekly
* Closer to all of our family in reality
* Closer to the barn where we keep our horses and my daughter rides, would allow her to ride more frequently

Cons to Moving

* Further from my husband's location
* He works a very sporadic schedule, sometimes very late, sometimes very early
* Higher interest rates now than when we purchased our home
* Home values in the area to move to not increasing at the rate that they are where we are currently located

I just really want to know if I'm being unreasonable.  I am scared that our family is going to fall apart over this.

Edit: I am going to add for those who are wondering, we currently keep our finances completely separate and pay all expenses 50/50.  We make about the same money wise, although technically I make more than he does.  ",Not enough info,2024-10-22,"AITAH?

20,1g9lidl,AITA for telling my sister not to speak to me until she speak with respect? ,"My mom and sister are staying with me, and I used to constantly ask them to clean up their space (the living room). They would give me excuses like, ""Where am I supposed to put it?"" and always had an attitude. I suggested using storage bins and eventually bought a storage rack. I stopped asking them (especially my sister) to clean up because I didn’t want to deal with their attitudes. 

Also, when I told my kids to clean the dining room table and they came across my sister’s items, they would say, ""Auntie, where should I put this?"" She would ignore them, and they had to repeat it a few times before she would respond with an attitude. 

So, here’s the problem: My mom suddenly told us that our family is stopping by from out of town today, so I immediately asked if everyone was going to clean up (I may have said it with an attitude), but I was talking to my mom. My sister interjected, saying with an attitude, “This is all of your kids’ stuff” (even though her items were there too). I tried to ignore her, but she kept going on and on, so I responded with an attitude and raised my voice as well. 

I then tried to steer the conversation back to my mom three separate times until I finally just went to my room, vented to my brother, and cried. I came back to the living room and told my sister that until she speaks with some respect, she shouldn’t say anything to me. I said that I didn’t care that she does things for the kids without anyone asking; that doesn’t give her the right to speak to people like that. She paused, and I hurried her along, asking if she had anything to say. She took too long, so I walked away; she never got the chance to express how she felt. AITA?

I have a long distance friend (Friend A)  (2 hours apart) they work an unconventional job that gives them weird working hours and their “weekend” is typical like Wednesday and Thursday. I work a typical 9-5 in an environment where I can’t really get away with leaving work early etc. 
They’ve been begging forever to go to this one restaurant- to keep this anonymous I’m just going to call it Chillis for a long while. 
However they can only go Thursday- the location is two hours away for me, and I have to leave for work on Fridays at 5:30AM. 
I continue to deny the request and explain that it doesn’t fit my schedule. 
Well, this past Friday. A close family friend (Friend B) who is like a sibling to me, invited me to Chilis- which I accepted. 
I posted on Facebook my drinks etc. and Friend A proceeded to send me literal paragraphs of how I was a terrible person, made them cry, “broke them” because I can make time for other people but not them. 
For additional reference. Friend A and Friend B know one another but do not get along. 
Friend A claims that I know their schedule, but have not made any efforts to accommodate their requests. When prompted on why do we have to go to Chilis- it’s because they’ve spent time, & money to prep for going- all because of me and they don’t want to go with anyone else or by themselves. 
I think valid points are that I do have openings in my schedule but often don’t open them to Friend A because I’ve been shut down by them due to their work schedule….

22,1g9kv89,AITA for refusing to go to my boyfriend's house?,"So I (22M) have been with my boyfriend (""Kyle"", 20M) for 5 months. Overall, our relationship is great, we share a lot of the same values, hobbies, passions, and get along generally very well and I truly love this man with my heart. However, we have one issue and that is his apartment. 

Kyle lives at home with his single mother and 5 younger siblings. They also have 4 cats which I am highly allergic to. The issue is not the cats, or the family members, but the wellbeing of the home. I can't walk in a straight line without tripping over something because it is so full of clutter. Kyle also never puts his dishes away and leaves rotting food around his room in dishes or containers, in his bed, on his ""floor"" (which is invisible because of how many items he has hoarded) and it is honestly such a turn off. Every time I am there I try to clean and help out, put his dishes away, tidy his room, but he gets upset and says I am being judgmental. He also doesn't clean up after his cats, he will see cat waste on the floor and comment about it but walk around it. The thing is, when he is at my place, he helps with chores willingly and keeps up his hygiene, it's just in his own home where he doesn't.

I have asthma attacks every time I am there because of all the mold and cat filth. Kyle doesn't care, just tells me to take my medication, which is effectively useless in this condition of home. Last weekend he invited me to his place and I flat out refused, saying I will not enter an environment which is a hazard to my health. He blew up at me, called me a ""rich snob"", claimed I don't love him and don't want to spend time with him.

23,1g9kusm,AITA For selling insulation without confirming a price with my partner.,"Sometimes its hard to quantify how my partner makes me feel.  But this made me feel like one of us was being an ass:

So we've got two piles of just junk in our house. One in the workshop one in the garage.  The garage also has 11 full rolls of pink insulation from trying to drywall the garage.  We've talked about the rolls and agreed to sell them.  I've asked my partner a number of times how much we should sell them for and they have consistently said ""we'll talk about it later.""

Labor day comes around and I tell them I plan on cleaning out the garage. They say they are going to go hang with their friend.  I make it clear to my partner that my intent is to throw some things away and sell the insulation and that I might not remember to take a picture of everything I throw away.  I ask again how much they think I should sell the insulation for.  They say that's fine to the first and I don't know to the second.  I say ok, I'll figure it out, and of they want to help at all with it I would really appreciate it.  They say that they'll think about it.

That morning, they leave for their friend's and I start on the garage.  The insulation runs $20 a roll on homedepot and, we've had these in our garage for about 5 years now.  So I want to move em on the cheap.  I put them on marketplace for $7/roll or $5/roll if you buy 2 or more.  Why the discount?  Cause someone with a $20 bill would rather 4 rolls of sealed insulation over 2 rolls and $6 back.  Well within 45 minutes I've got a buyer, they take the lot $65 in my pocket and I don't have to look at the rolls anymore.  I spend the full day cleaning and organizing the garage.  Throwing out garbage and straightening up while listening to true crime podcasts.  Sending periodic updates to my partner.

My partner comes back around 8pm with their friend.  The friend looks at the garage and is wowed.  They say it looks 4 ft wider without the pile of junk.  My partner doesn't comment passed ""good job."" I tell them both I managed to sell all the insulation rolls and made $65.  The friend seems really impressed, a one day listing generating $65.  My partner, complained that if they had sold it they would have made each roll cost more and that they would not have Givin a discount.  That I lost money since the insulation was so much more at home depot, and I should have told them the price I was posting the rolls at first.  I could only comment on how I had asked for their help.

It hurt, and was a bit jarring with the juxtaposition of responses between my partner who I've been married to for 13 years and their friend who I've hung out with maybe 6-8 times.  But I don't know, maybe I'm just an asshole.  I'll let you decide.

Her death was really hard for me (16f) but what made things even worse was I felt like my half siblings (23 and 25) were giddy about the fact mom had died. She was their stepmom for 20 years. They lost their mom 13 years ago and I know how much they still miss her. They would always get really on edge on the anniversary of her death. I even saw them cry a few times. They never liked me seeing that though and would tell me to get lost.

My half siblings used to blame my mom for their mom's death. They'd say it should have been mom instead of their mom. I get that they were kids so I'm not going to say I hate them for feeling that way. But I think that hatred for my mom living longer than theirs stayed. I remember they never came to see my mom when she was sick and they weren't here when she died and when they showed up they seemed so happy. They acted like it was no big deal. I could hear them laughing and giggling while dad and I were going through funeral plans. A couple of relatives said it seemed so disrespectful for them to be so joyful around us and how could they not hold it in given dad and I had lost mom. Others thought they should at least look like they cared a little. But then I also heard them laugh off someone who tried to offer them sympathy at the funeral saying mom wasn't anything to them and they didn't care.

A few weeks after the funeral they had taken down all traces of mom from their places and they were warning him they had photoshopped her out of photos they posted online because now she's gone they can make them look like they wanted. Dad was so hurt and they argued.

But now dad is trying to talk them into joining ""us"" for her anniversary coming up. They already said no and said they have nothing to grieve and they don't miss her. But dad still wants us to be together as a family. I told him I won't be there if they are. That I'm not about to spend the day with people who seem like they're glad mom's dead. I said she isn't their mom but she is mine and I love and miss her and don't want to be around people who show so much joy that she's gone.

25,1g9kf9t,AITA for calling my MIL a bad house wife ,"I don't know where to turn to so I am turning to this. I called my MIL a bad house wife Infront of my husband and FIL. So a bit of back story. 

My hubby and I have been together for 4 years and married for 1and a half. His mom has never liked me and she can't give me a reason why even after I asked her. The smallest of things will set her off like when I was pregnant and the food she made triggered some nausea she almost went crazy. We have been living with them for about a year now and it has been a year of hell so far. 

In the past she has made house rules to suit her and when we played along with the rules she would get upset. My FIL works overseas and he comes home every few weeks. She does not clean the house before he comes home (and I mean their living area and their bedroom) when he is here she does not wash his clothes or hangs them. We had a rule in the house (her idea) that three times a week she makes food and them the rest of the week it is me and when you make food you have to clean the kitchen. 

The three days she makes food, she leaves the dishes in the sink until the morning of my day or she would ask my husband to clean the dishes before I start cooking. After a while she just stopped doing the dishes on her nights and my hubby and I had to clean the kitchen everyday. I talked to her about it because she would ask us to clean before her days begins and we agreed to keep to the house rule. 

FIL's last rotation came around and now he is home for good. They don't really talk to each other or even eat dinner together. On a grocery run I made with her, she told me that FIL is very unhappy with her because the house is always messy and she doesn't do his laundry but she told him that she will not be his cleaner and he can do it himself. 

The newest thing and the final straw for me was she started a diet recently and decided that she will only be making food for herself and I need to make food for the rest of the house. She will only be cleaning her own dishes. But she never does. She would leave her dishes in the sink until my hubby washes them or she would pick out her things from the full sink and was them. I decided that I would start doing the same as I am not the wife of this house. I started only cleaning my things and hubby's things and I could see it really bothered her. Then she started leaving all her dishes on the drying wrack for days until I ask her to pack them away. 

During the day I would be the one that offers to make my FIL a cup of coffee or something to eat as she just makes for herself. 

A few nights ago she was complaining about something my FIL did and I guess I just snapped. I said to her that she is a bad housewife because her job is to take care of her husband and she refuses to do that.

My sister never shared a name with a cousin. She had a family name where she was the only living person with it in the family. I did share a name with three cousins and an uncle and I hated it. I chose to use my middle name mostly because it was ""unique"" in terms of the family. Not unique in general just fyi.

We decided to scrap the one we had originally chosen and we covered over it in the nursery. My sister and mom saw the finished nursery a couple of days ago and my sister asked about the name and she told me she was hurt we were changing it.

Although this appears one-sided it's just what works in our house. For her own reasons is not inclined to cook.

On nights when I cook, she will often offer to do this dishes. After dinner though I am already in the mood to get things cleaned up in the kitchen so I just do it. It also matters to me more because I'm the one who needs the kitchen clean. To which she'll say ""I was gonna do that...""

There have been times when I've given her the opportunity to follow through on her offers.

Recently she's been getting more insistent that she's going to do them, but they are still never done before bed. Last week I again ""stole"" doing the dishes from her and she became irritated and said ""why are you doing the dishes? I said I was going to do it!""

29,1g9jsg3,AITA for telling my mother off on the anniversary of my stepfather's death because she insists on calling him Dad?,"My stepfather died a few years ago. He was a great man. I loved him, and I miss him, and I'm especially sorry my mother lost him sooner than they expected. But I never called him Dad, never wanted to call him Dad, and told my mother repeatedly that I didn't want to call him Dad -- and yet that's how she eventually always referred to him.

I called him by his first name for most of the time we knew each other. He didn't mind. He never once asked me to call him anything else. That's one of the things I respected most about him. Near the end, I embraced a sort of in-between term, partly because I knew he didn't have much time left. My mother made a huge deal of how I started to use that term. But even before then, she had long since started to refer to him as Dad. This confused me at first. I had a dad. He was a mess of a person who left a lot of scars and voids before he died relatively young. That's part of why I don't want to call anyone else Dad: I held out hope into adulthood that my dad would see some sort of light and become ""my dad"" again, and he didn't, and then he died.

I've accepted that, at least the best I can, but the term Dad still conjures hurt and longing and questions that'll never have definitive answers.

Meanwhile, even after I've communicated this to my mother more times than I think I should have to over many years, she still nonchalantly referred/refers to my stepfather as Dad, before and after he died.

Today, I'd had enough.

My mother texted me this morning: ""Tomorrow is two years since I lost (his name). I bought a 2-liter of (his favorite soda). ... Why don't you get a can or 20 oz. and have a drink to Dad? He loved you like a (biological child).""

AITA for making an ultimatum of it on the anniversary of my stepfather's death?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-22,"AITA for telling my mother off on the anniversary of my stepfather's death because she insists on calling him Dad? My stepfather died a few years ago. He was a great man. I loved him, and I miss him, and I'm especially sorry my mother lost him sooner than they expected. But I never called him Dad, never wanted to call him Dad, and told my mother repeatedly that I didn't want to call him Dad -- and yet that's how she eventually always referred to him.

I called him by his first name for most of the time we knew each other. He didn't mind. He never once asked me to call him anything else. That's one of the things I respected most about him. Near the end, I embraced a sort of in-between term, partly because I knew he didn't have much time left. My mother made a huge deal of how I started to use that term. But even before then, she had long since started to refer to him as Dad. This confused me at first. I had a dad. He was a mess of a person who left a lot of scars and voids before he died relatively young. That's part of why I don't want to call anyone else Dad: I held out hope into adulthood that my dad would see some sort of light and become ""my dad"" again, and he didn't, and then he died.

I've accepted that, at least the best I can, but the term Dad still conjures hurt and longing and questions that'll never have definitive answers.

Meanwhile, even after I've communicated this to my mother more times than I think I should have to over many years, she still nonchalantly referred/refers to my stepfather as Dad, before and after he died.

Today, I'd had enough.

My mother texted me this morning: ""Tomorrow is two years since I lost (his name). I bought a 2-liter of (his favorite soda). ... Why don't you get a can or 20 oz. and have a drink to Dad? He loved you like a (biological child).""

I replied: ""Mom, I got to where I'd call him (in-between term). I have asked you a billion times not to call (his name) Dad to me, and you won't respect that.

30,1g9jqp0,AITA for cancelling a holiday?,"My girlfriend and I had plans to go abroad this month for five nights, which we booked three months ago. Last week, though, I got the horrible news that my mum has been diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer, and it’s spread. She lives alone and will be starting chemo next month.

Since she’s on her own and has no one else to stay with her, I told my girlfriend I might need to cancel the trip to support my mum. I mentioned that she could still go and enjoy herself, but I just wouldn’t feel right going away knowing my mum will be alone during her treatment.

My girlfriend pointed out that it was too late to cancel for a refund and said it’s only for five nights, so I could see my mum before and after the trip. I reiterated that I didn’t want her to be alone after treatment when she’s likely to feel pretty rough and need support.

I made it clear that I wasn’t trying to stop my girlfriend from going; I just couldn’t go myself. She accused me of being selfish, saying there’s nothing I can do while I’m here anyway. She said if I did cancel that I should be paying her the money she will lose which i disagreed with as there is nothing stopping her going. 

I told her that being there for my mum is me doing something, and I felt she was being selfish for prioritising a trip over my mum’s health.

For context, we still go to school, we live together in boarding school and were just at choir practice- weve been friends for 2 years but have become quite close.

For the past few months I’ve been struggling a lot with impulsivity. I have ADHD and tend not to think before I speak, sometimes phrasing things or just saying things that might hurt others or might come off as weird. I’m trying my best to do better and I’ve talked a lot about this issue with S. 

Lately I noticed her behavior changing slightly too, she’s started making passive aggressive and weirdly judgy comments whenever I’d tell her something I’ve done or want to do, or generally when I say or do things that in my opinion don’t need to be judged. She never gives me any context for those comments and just leaves me feeling odd and uncomfortable. 

So about half an hour ago we had choir practice and were singing an old english song. Someone made a rolling r sound that we found funny and laughed about- but to me that laughing wasn’t in bad faith at all, i just thought it sounded funny. So, when there was a short break i asked another girl if she had been the one making the r sound and S made a passive aggressive comment about it, as well as another classmate of mine which I didnt understand- (i suppose i do get how that could be taken the wrong way and am planning on apologizing to that girl i asked because I had no bad intentions at all and feel bad)

Well when S made that comment I got annoyed since it’s been getting to me being passively corrected so often. We started arguing- though calmly but I felt like she felt personally attacked when i told her that those comments make me uncomfortable, which again wasnt my intention. But then the choir started singing again and I left after asking her to continue to talk later because I got overwhelmed and was close to tears and i didnt want to make a scene- which again upset her.

So just now she practically stormed into my room and started rambling about how its not fair of me to expect her to be so aware of my sensitivities, saying I cant expect her to not make those “impulsive” comments when I get to be impulsive. I told her that Im not expecting her to put up with my impulsive behavior, Im just asking her to not make these context-less judgy comments that just make me feel shitty and instead to actually talk to me so I can correct my behavior and better myself. (im not the only one who has noticed her judgy attitude so I dont believe Im just being sensitive) 

We ended the conversation when she said she couldnt handle this type of expectation to change and essentially said she wasnt going to work on her behavior because that would be too much right now- which I kind of understand, given that were all very stressed currently.

34,1g9i21g,AITA for not allowing my son to be punished after he refused to do his school presentation?,"My son “George” just turned 13 this month. 

George is very bright, projected to get 8s or 9s in his GCSEs, and regularly achieves these grades in his mock exams and assessments. But he struggles socially and has been bullied badly in the past. Things are better now, but he isn’t popular. 

As part of his PD class, he had to create a children’s toy and give a sales pitch to the class. Last Friday was the presentation day, and George was really excited. He’d put a lot of effort into his toy and the presentation.

But I got a notification saying George had been given a C3 (after-school detention), something he’s never received before. As he’d refused to participate in class and didn’t do his presentation. When I picked him up, I could tell immediately that he was upset.

I asked him what happened and why he didn’t do the presentation. He said he didn’t refuse the presentation; when it was his turn, he asked to go later. His teacher said no, and that he had to do it then or get a C3. George said he “couldn’t do it now,” but didn’t explain further when asked, so he was given the C3.

I kept pressing him, worried that maybe he was being bullied again. Eventually, he told me the real reason: he had a random erection just before his turn and, no matter what, it “wouldn’t go down”.

With that info, I think George’s request was perfectly reasonable. He didn’t refuse to do the presentation—he simply asked to do it a little later. Obviously, he didn’t want to explain the reason in front of the whole class when the teacher asked him.

His mum was really angry with him for getting the C3. I explained what happened and said I didn’t think George was wrong. I said I’m not supporting the detention and would pick him up at the normal time. When I told his mum what happened, she looked disgusted and said something like, “Why did he even have one in class to begin with?” I explained that random erections happen, especially in early puberty, and they don’t always relate to sexual thoughts, which is what she was assuming. She replied, “Well, I’m not sure that’s true,” dismissing what I said. So I told her, “You might not be sure, but I am.”

She insisted we needed to present a united front, along with the school, and that by going against her, I was sending George the wrong message. I asked why her way of handling it was automatically right and why I should be the one to concede. It escalated into a big argument, which we haven’t had in years.

I don't know if I am overreacting so here I am. Sometimes I jump to conclusions and think of the worst case scenario and I generally try to avoid that. For context; we have only been married for a few months, together for about 5 years now. 

Yesterday evening; my husband, let's call him Davis (fake name), told me that there are some funny videos that he would like to show me on Tik Tok. I don't have the app so I can't really view them if he sends those videos to me. So as we were lying in bed together with him holding the phone for us to see above our faces, we viewed the videos together, one by one. Then he quickly scrolled through his facebook notifications in front of me and I noticed that he received a notification that said ""taking a break from Facebook Dating"". Obviously, my spidey senses went off so I asked some questions. 

I asked him what is this to which he said that he has been on it before he met me and has not been on it for the duration of our relationship and that it was left forgotten. I then asked if that is the case, then why isn't it deleted? He said he is not good with technology. I deleted his profile for him in front of him right then and there. 

I told Davis how I felt and that I don't buy that excuse ""I am not good with technology"". He uses Facebook on the regular, and actively participates in facebook groups. He got immediately upset and asked me if I thought he was cheating. I pointed out that I did not insinuate that he is cheating or that I thought he was.

He got mad, got up from bed and went to sleep on the couch. AITA for questioning him? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-22,"AITA for questioning my husband when I noticed his Facebook Dating profile was not deleted  
I don't know if I am overreacting so here I am. Sometimes I jump to conclusions and think of the worst case scenario and I generally try to avoid that. For context; we have only been married for a few months, together for about 5 years now. 

Yesterday evening; my husband, let's call him Davis (fake name), told me that there are some funny videos that he would like to show me on Tik Tok. I don't have the app so I can't really view them if he sends those videos to me. So as we were lying in bed together with him holding the phone for us to see above our faces, we viewed the videos together, one by one. Then he quickly scrolled through his facebook notifications in front of me and I noticed that he received a notification that said ""taking a break from Facebook Dating"". Obviously, my spidey senses went off so I asked some questions. 

I asked him what is this to which he said that he has been on it before he met me and has not been on it for the duration of our relationship and that it was left forgotten. I then asked if that is the case, then why isn't it deleted? He said he is not good with technology. I deleted his profile for him in front of him right then and there. 

I told Davis how I felt and that I don't buy that excuse ""I am not good with technology"". He uses Facebook on the regular, and actively participates in facebook groups. He got immediately upset and asked me if I thought he was cheating. I pointed out that I did not insinuate that he is cheating or that I thought he was. I just said that I don't buy the reasoning that he is not good with technology. He is already on Tik Tok for goodness sake.

38,1g9ho8b,AITA for not leaving my friend to spend time with a guy I'm seeing?,"I (22F) have been in a relationship with a guy (24M) for 3-ish years. We broke up in August for several reasons but stayed in contact and are trying to see if it's worth giving the relationship another shot.

He has been very busy for the past month. This weekend we spent a substantial amount of time with each other. Yesterday (monday) I was under the impression that he would be busy since that is what he told me during the weekend. I was home for 2 hours until a friend asked if I wanted to play some videogames together. I said yes. After about 30 minutes my ex (for a lack of a better word) says he made time for me and we can hang out if I'm not busy. I said I'm playing with a friend. My ex replies ""Come hang. You have 24/7 with your friend. It's rare that I have free time."" 

I told him I've said before that I don't like being told to do things like it's not an option, that he could have told me earlier that he was planning on making time for it (before I make plans) and that I didn't want to just ditch my friend after 30 minutes when I had told him I would play. My ex then then tells me that's a cheap and dismissive response and that I am picking my friend over him and spitting in his face by not being flexible when he's been busy for so long.

I stood my ground and didn't leave my friend but now my ex is angry and considering leaving for good because he thinks it's unattractive and pathetic (his words) that I won't bend my own values so I can spend time with him. He keeps reiterating that I am picking my friend over him.

I've been turning this situation over in my head the whole day and I'm starting to feel guilty.

I met loose friends for lunch and they were asking me how things were going and about her. I mentioned 1 parent now lives in a different town and they asked why, I didn't know the specifics such as why or timelines etc, but I assumed it was a divorce/separation. Said something like ""don't know maybe divorced"".

It turns out one of the people at the table there knows  this girls parents and they proceeded to tell their parents ""x and y are divorced"" to which they summised completely by themselves it was due to unfaithfulness.. 

I feel terrible that my oversight and ill consideration of mentioning this could spiral into a completely unsolicited rumour. I feel bad that this could cause distrust at an early stage as I'm beginning to really like this girl, I also feel terrible as she mentioned one of her parents is having a rough time at the minute with it and this spreading could make it worse for them. 

At the minute, I am completely ""worst case scenario-ing"" the repercussions but I still feel bad and tbh I plan on not engaging with the person who pedaled this further as it shows a complete bad taste in character.

My mom has been desperately trying to find something for me to do, so she forced me to sign up to be one of those nuisances on the phone who calls you to ask about how you’re voting in the upcoming election. 

So I did it yesterday for about two hours, and hated every second of it. Even with the script in front of me, I was nervous and stuttering and could barely get my words out. I thought just once would be the end of it, but apparently my mom wants me to do it every single day until the election. And of course, I don’t want to. Even without seeing the faces of the people I was calling, the process was so mentally draining that I couldn’t even pick up a pen to work on my passion project afterwards. When I explained that to my mom, she just said, “you have plenty of hours in a day; two won’t kill you,” even though I felt like my heart was in my throat with every call and I thought I would burst into tears at any second.

So, since she’s forcing my anxiety into overdrive, I want to put my foot down and insist that I get paid to do this, like an allowance, so I can motivate myself to do it despite my anxiety. It’s only fair; after all, it’s over a day’s worth of panicking before, during, and after every call.

He suffered brain damage at birth, has a missing kidney, has digestive issues that means he eats through a feeding tube, he cannot walk and can only make sounds instead of talking. My parents time and attention has to be focused on him more than on me. For the first few years after he was born I spent a lot of time with my grandpa who raised me from the age of 2 until I was about 7 and then I was seen as ""old enough"" to be at home after school and could make my own food and clean up after myself and not need supervision mostly. Grandpa was willing, and had offered, to keep taking me after school but my parents said he didn't need to do it and he deserved to live his life.

I never get 1:1 time with my parents. They couldn't afford field trips and never took the time to apply for the school field trip fund so grandpa picked up the slack there. He paid into my school lunch account so I didn't have to make my own lunch. Grandpa was the person who'd pick me up from school if I was sick. He'd stay and take care of me at home since whichever parent would be home would really just say to go to bed or lay on the couch and relax and there was no caring for me or taking care of sick little me.

When I was 11 I got picked for this junior programmers contest through our school district but my parents said they couldn't take the time for it so they refused to sign off and since grandpa couldn't, even though he offered to take me, I missed out on that. When my laptop broke in October 2020 it was grandpa who replaced it for me so I could, you know, school when school wasn't in person.

When I got older I was asked to do more like cook for everyone, pick up meds or get the special bath ready for my brother. A few times my mom or dad even reprimanded me for not doing off my own initiative.

I had one exam this afternoon and another in 2 days. So my older sister 19 who I’ll call Kate. She currently does nothing at home. I have come from my exams nearly every time to find a fair amount of housework I need to get done.

So Chris has now started having showers after dinner. She spends up to 25 minutes in the shower then she spends another 20 minutes getting dressed. She did this tonight while Kate wanted ice cream. My dad asked her to help me and him do the dishes but Kate straight up said no. 

Kate then had ice cream and got no problem. Kate was also being a real POS to me earlier today (I can put that in another post if people want) so I wasn’t in the greatest move. Chris suddenly emerged when I was practically done except for white 6 items. I told Chris  “there is no point now Chris, I am already done.”. Emma then comes in and blows my brain off saying shit to me like “Just because you do housework, doesn’t make you any more special than us.” And “you need to pull your head out of your ass and lose your attitude, these girls do housework”. At this point I snapped. I yelled for 5 minutes straight in a heated conversation with Emma. Emma basically told me to go study which is the only thing I am good for.

My father left my mother when she was 8 months pregnant with my brother and I was 17 months old. The story, as told by my mother, is as follows: 

My parents met in school at age 14, they got married at 21 and bought a house together. Had me at 23 and were happy together. My father got a new job and began an affair with a receptionist who is some 10 years older than my parents and was also married with a young daughter.y mother began to suspect something when my father started working significant amounts of overtime but wasn’t receiving any extra pay. She questioned him and for a time he denied it. However just before Christmas that year he came home and told my mother he was leaving her as his mistress had had a miscarriage and needed his support. As previously mentioned, my mum was about 8 months pregnant with my brother at this time. She begged him to stay and work it out but he refused and left. My brother was born 2/3 weeks later and he came to the hospital after the birth as his mistress didn’t want him there. He stayed for half an hour and then left her, not even giving her time to shower. My mother became extremely depressed. I have heard from my grandmother how bad it was, how she didn’t eat, didn’t leave her bed. She has next to no memory of my brother until his 1st birthday due to the emotional trauma. According to my mother, my father wanted to have a relationship with myself but wasn’t as interested in my brother. He came round a few times but was more interested in his new family. After about 6 months he stopped coming all together. Apparently he came round having not been in over a month and I screamed and cried until I was sick in his car and that was that. I never saw him again. 

My mother has since said that if I ever attempted to speak to my father she would disown me. She once said she hopes I spit on him if I ever meet him. The issues I have are that I know my mum. I know my father was in the wrong, I absolutely do not condone his actions or behaviour and I believe that if he had really wanted to her could have had a relationship with me. However, having grown up with my mum I know she would have done everything in her power to stop him seeing us. I know she told me he was a “bad man”, I know she sent her friends to watch us when we went out with him, I know she wanted to hurt him. I don’t blame her for that. But I also know they were 25 and at 25 years old people don’t always make the best choices. I’d like to give my father the opportunity to explain his experience, I’d like the opportunity to form my own opinion and decide whether he’s a person worth knowing. But if I do this, it will break my mums heart. And that might just make me an asshole after everything she has done for me.

My mother has since said that if I ever attempted to speak to my father she would disown me. She once said she hopes I spit on him if I ever meet him. The issues I have are that I know my mum. I know my father was in the wrong, I absolutely do not condone his actions or behaviour and I believe that if he had really wanted to her could have had a relationship with me. However, having grown up with my mum I know she would have done everything in her power to stop him seeing us. I know she told me he was a “bad man”, I know she sent her friends to watch us when we went out with him, I know she wanted to hurt him. I don’t blame her for that. But I also know they were 25 and at 25 years old people don’t always make the best choices. I’d like to give my father the opportunity to explain his experience, I’d like the opportunity to form my own opinion and decide whether he’s a person worth knowing. But if I do this, it will break my mums heart. And that might just make me an asshole after everything she has done for me. ",0.0,0.9851503968238832,1,0
45,1g9gk2t,AITA for not showing answers to a friend during exam,"
My friend 20(F) and i 18(F) were classmates for as long as i remember but became very close in 2022 after her best friend moved to another school. We became a group of 4 bestfriends and were super close, and basically did everything together.

Fast forward to 2 years at the start of 2024. We noticed that she started talking to people that we had beef with and started to gossip with them in class, at first we were annoyed but thought of it as her just being social. She started to respond in our group chat much less and started doing more things without telling us anything. We noticed but its not like she talked much about her before, she was always kind of a ""talk less about yourself"" kind of person.

During around late august she participated in a program for our school and got to know people from other sections and she practically ran away from us during that time, she'd say no to any plans we made, and would always say ""i dont hv money to hangout or to buy food"" but the next day we'd see her posting stories of her hanging out with her new ""friends"". Since we were very close, if one of us brought food to the class or bought food at the canteen all 4 of us would share it equally, but suddenly she started buying food for herself and refused to share with us.

 She was very rude to me when i asked her about something a few weeks back which made me very upset since we never had any reason to fall out like this, not a single argument or mishap. She even treats our other friend like this. Our 3rd friend also 18(F) and her share the same route to their house, so this friend would drop her off at her house with her car almost regularly, but she would pretend like nothing happened the next day and ignore her as well. Not to mention when ever we have exams in class she'll try to sit with me, and shamelessly almost ""orders"" me to show her all the answers, now if we were as close as before id think of it as nothing but how can she treat me like she doesnt even see me and then say that to me.

Today our 3rd friend was visibly upset and told me what happened was that she asked her if she wanted to hangout since she couldnt go home for another 1 hr. This friend totally ignored her question and was like you shouldnt walk around when its so hot outside and blah blah, then she met another ""friend"" of hers and practically left our friend behind and started walking with that girl and shared an umbrella with her. She left without even saying bye to our friend and didnt even look back once. Oh and did i mention, whenever she skips classes she always copies this friends notes and she has the audacity to treat her like that. 

We decided not to confront her about her behaviour because we only have 4 months of class left together and then we will be going our own ways. So my friend convinced me not to say anything to her.Anyways I was really frustrated with everything going on and needed to vent. But am i the asshole for hating her?

The problem is, I clean EVERYTHING I USE 100% of the time, and I don't clean anything I don't use, because in my opinion, each person should clean their own mess. They claim that I should still do extra chores for what seems like no reason to me, and I don't clean any of their stuff regardless.

I'm not doing it for free. If they want someone to clean up after them they'll need to hire someone.

As a clarification, I'm not living here free, I pay for my room and my own food, I just use their dishes and kitchen. Am I in the wrong here? I'd like to know.

Normally I would stay out of something like this but she's clearly in pain and she's pushing herself past her limits. I spoke to her first and she feels insecure which is why she's working out so much because she thinks my brother will find a mistress or something if she doesn't look even better than she did before. She didn't outright say any of that but it was easy to infer based on what she did say. Anyway, it's all nonsense and I know her sister has got into her head because she's always saying stupid things about how people like my brother usually have a woman in every city to her.

I let my brother know about the exercise and her obvious insecurities. He spoke to her and she denied it and now she doesn't want me coming to visit my nephew unless my brother is also there. I've tried to call her to apologise but she isn't taking my calls. Every time I've called her she's complained about me to my brother so I'm going to stop for now to give her space.

49,1g9fldv,AITA for wanting part of the money from my house's sale?? ,"

Okay I'll try to keep this short, and please keep in mind that I'm not a native English speaker. So back in 2009-ish when I was 10yrs old, my father wrote my childhood home on my name, so legally it became mine.

In 2017 when I was 18yrs old and finally an adult which meant I had full ownership and rights over the house, my mom and sister told me (AFTER they decided it between themselves) that they will sell the house. I was extremely naive and ignorant at that age so I was like okay what the hell why not. Looking back they were very shady about it and never divulged why they would do that, they just told me we should do something ""grand"" with the money because the house is going to get older and no one will live in it anymore. So my mom handled the entire thing and just needed me for signing the papers. Again, I was very ignorant. She took me to the bank and transferred the money to an account she opened in her name because I was too ""young"" to have a bank account in my name. Again, faceslapping myself for agreeing so easily to this entire thing.

Fast forward to now, I'm 25 and ended up living with my mother after leaving an abusive ex husband. They won't let me have access to the money even if I'm a single mother now with no help because my mom still works and my sister doesn't help me babysit. I have found a media buying certificate that I want to get which costs 2k dollars. My mom and sister (they're basically one, very enmeshed and I was basically always the outsider to them) won't give me the 2k, they don't believe I can work from home and basically they're the ones controlling what I can do based on what they think is possible or right (which is very limited bc they have no idea about jobs or the market rn)

I found out that they plan to open up their own business without even asking me. Any business idea I tried to pitch in was ignored or even laughed at by my mom (I told her I'd like to open a bag boutique and she barked a laugh then ignored me, like they always do) They haven't done anything with it since 2017 because they're afraid of taking risks and don't know where to start so basically the money is literally wasting away while I'm in the worst mental place I've ever been in my life, stuck and controlled.

Where we live schools are split into primary school (kindy to 6) and high school (7 to 12). Riley, who is in year 8, goes to a selective state school.

She is also in one of the top sets, which naturally gives her a smaller class size and extension work.

My year 6, Daisy, does okay academically, but is not as inclined that way compared to her sister. I think she will get lost in the crowd should she attend the state school her sister attends. This option is always open for her as we live in the local catchment. Daisy, however, is an exceptional musician and has obtained a diploma in both the cello and piano. 

At the private school near where we live, Daisy has gotten a music scholarship which partially covers the school fees.

She asked what I was planning for the evening and I said I'd likely just have a couple of drinks, order some food and play video games and watch Netflix and have a nice chilled night.
She got a bit annoyed and said she might have asked me to pick her up but I can't if I'm drinking. 

I said she could always get a taxi like she usually does but she said I should be fine with picking her up. I told her I shouldn't have to change my plans just because she refuses to get a taxi. 

She said I was being unfair but asked if I would book the taxi for her. I said I would if I was awake but that there's a good chance I'll already be asleep as she'll be back late.

She said I should wait up then but I just pointed out the club event ends at 3am so I'm not waiting up until 3 just to possibly book a taxi. I pointed out she's more than capable of sorting out her own taxis or asking her friends to book it for her. 

She said she wasn't asking for much and that it's only one night but I just said she can't expect me to sit around waiting for her.

She just said again that she wasn't asking for much and I should be fine with helping her. I told her again to text me when she's finished and if I'm awake I'll book a taxi but if not she is more than capable of booking it herself or getting a friend to book it.

55,1g9e0zz,AITA for not throwing a birthday party for our friend after she missed out on the first one?,"So our friend Emily (real name changed) is a really nice and sensitive person but she has issues when it comes to too many people celebrating in a small space. The first is she feels claustrophobic which is understandable and she literally has trouble breathing. The second reason is that she has certain triggers when it comes to parties.

Long story short she's avoidant of parties and celebratory gatherings because when she was young she was doing a baby shower with her parents and they started arguing for no reason which eventually got worse and led to them separating and it really traumatised her. 

I just want to clarify Emily is always a very nice person she'll always compliment you and sometimes she's hypersensitive she'll see a waiter working and she'll cry because she thinks about how much they're going through because that's how big her heart is so don't think she's selfish just because ""she can't stand seeing other people happy"". 

Anyway we have another friend in the group, Jessica who we've planned to throw a birthday party. We knew Emily would have issues so we offered many alternatives. We said we could try to keep the lights on, and not be too loud, or we could have designate a safe space for her in the house that she could get to. She said no, because she doesn't want us to change the party because of her. So we said we could stream it to her online over the internet and she could meet up with us after the party where we were planning to watch a movie. 

She was really upset about not being able to come to the party but she agreed. Then on the day she showed up anyway with a puppy which was her support animal and she said she will try and fight for her happiness. However two of our other friends are actually both separately allergic to dogs and in Emily's defence she's not too familiar with either of them so she didn't know. But when the topic was brought up I told her to just leave with the puppy for now and I'll think of something to make it up to her later. 

She was very upset but didn't say anything when she left. I tried sending her messages inviting her to go out together but she's not responding to any of us. Two days later she sent basically a wall of text to me, and apparently only me, saying I shouldn't have promised her something if I wasn't going to do it. She said she thought I'd throw a make-up birthday party so she she could practise overcoming her own trauma but I didn't plan anything like that. I said it shouldn't be my responsibility for her mental health. She said yes but that would mean I just made her go away on the day and not even care about her.

56,1g9dki9,AITA For Not Inviting My Father and His Family to My Wedding and Cutting them out in my life?,"I, (23F), got married to my now husband that we will call Lin (39M). And yes, I know the age gap is big. But I do love him. And we both made a mistake. But we are making it work for our future child/ren. Anyways, the ones invited were my friends, my mom, my aunt, and Lin's family. Of course, at some point my father and his family found out and got mad. They were contacting my mom & me but we both blocked them.

You see, my father is not a great person nor a great father at all. Yes, he's there in my life but he made my life a living hell between him & his family and my grandmother & her family. My mom, my aunt, and I were practically the outcast in our family. They barely cared or acknowledges us until they suddenly hear news that one got married, got pregnant, got a new job or whatever. My father (48), has 7 kids in total from DIFFERENT women. I have 6 sisters and 1 brother. And he left the first 3 women for my mom and me (which I'm not happy about), then proceeded to CHEAT on my mom multiple times resulting for 2 more children. And whenever my mom tried to leave, he'd get desperate and mad and blackmail her so she's forced to stay in the relationship. He has hurt me emotionally, traumatised me for pointing a g*n at me when we were talking and got mad about what I said and even tried to touch me in my sleep. He never cared about what I wanted. Forces me to do things that I don't like or want to do.

From the start I saw how fake his family is. They say they are just a chaotic noisy family. But they hold grudges and uses those past mistakes in your face when fighting. That and they seem to love asking my mom for money SO MANY TIMES. One of them, my older cousin, owe her 1 million because she used her card behind her back when my mom trusted her.

Lin knew my family history, I told him the entire thing before we got married because if he wanted to marry me, he would need to know first my family history and then he can decide whether he wanted to marry me still or not. He still wanted to. Even when he knew I was Pagan. He never minded it. And even agreed to do 3 weddings for both my religion and his and just us with getting married in court.

And those 2/3 weddings my father and his family never got invited and Lin understood why. My mom and aunt understood. Even my friends and Lin’s family understood that I was deeply hurt and traumatised and if I don’t want them in my life or in the most important days of my life, then they are not invited.

But, the family in both sides, have called me selfish, ungrateful, disrespectful, and someone who will suffer and go to hell for what I believe in. And I ignored them but before I did, I called them hypocritical greedy manipulative liars. But in my country, cutting off family is a taboo thing. So, now, I’m afraid to go back.

57,1g9ctp9,WIBTA for not letting my sister move into my new house?,"Hi all, I'm on mobile so apologies for formatting. 

I'm (24F) currently living in my mums house with my mum, her husband, my sister (20F) and my younger brother. I've been living here about a year while I get on my feet again, paying rent and utilities costs to stay here. 

I'm just about to close on a house purchase. I'm so excited about moving and starting a life on my own. There have been ups and downs during the process and it's taken longer than expected, but I'm finally nearly done with the process and I'll have my keys in the next few weeks. 

My mums husband is not a nice man. Think of every group a person could hate, then add a few more surprise ones that you wouldn't even think of. He hates all of them, and he's very vocal about it every single day. He's never hurt anyone in the house and never would, he's just got a very poor personality and horrible views. I mention this because me and my sister don't get along with him, and his hatred of young people and queer people hits home personally for my sister. She says she feels victimised in this house and can't stand his attitude. I agree with her, but I'm better at ignoring him than she is. We're both autistic, so I understand it's difficult for her to process those negative emotions. I'm looking forward to getting away from him, so I understand why she's desperate to get away. 

She is desperate to leave, but she only works part time on a zero hours contract (she goes in whenever she wants a shift, there's always enough hours for her to bulk it up. I know because I work there too) so she doesn't have a lot of money. Renting is out of the question for her. I can't even afford to rent around here, that's why I purchased a house because a mortgage is far cheaper than rent. 

When she heard I was buying a house, her first question was ""can I live with you?"" and I was uncomfortable to be honest. I love her to bits but I wasn't in a position to think of things like that when I'd not even filed paperwork yet. My mum also says I should consider as ""it'll give her a lot of independence"" and she'll have more space and be happier. She won't be able to contribute to the bills enough to cover her costs, I know that because its the same here as she pays a little bit of money to my mum. I mentioned to my sister that she would have to pay more to live with me as my budget will be tight and she said she couldn't afford more than what she pays my mum. 

I could make it work. The house would have a spare room she could use instead of using it as an office. Yes it'd be a drain on my finances but she's my sister. But after living here in a cramped house in a converted conservatory rather than a real bedroom (I wish I was joking), I really do want to live alone, at least for a while.

We both live in different states. I recently got a new job, and shared that I was being paid $14 an hour, which is quite high among my peers (they are typically paid $10-12 an hour). For additional context, he is graduated and has a fulltime job. 

My friend said that I was incredibly privileged to be able to take that low of a wage. I told him that even if I was able to get a $20 an hour job, I wouldn't take it because it wasn't directly related to my future career, which is probably where I made a mistake. I also said that I was privileged for being able to ignore a higher wage to further my resume. 

I told him that $20 an hour where I lived was unheard of. He told me that I was saying that ""poor people sucked"" and then stopped responding to me. After a few minutes, I apologized for upsetting him, but emphasized that my state does not pay as much as his does. He hasn't responded since. 

I understand that privilege and being well off is a touchy subject, but I don't understand what I'm supposed to do about that.

She's the type of person to talk at you, not with you. My husband defends her because she's ""hard of hearing"". She loves to have a monologue and will talk about the most mundane things. 

The moment I get home from work, she will see me in the kitchen and tell me about her day in excruciating details. Sometimes she'll be ranting or asking a question (but she won't pause to listen or let you answer.)

61,1g9cdak,WIBTA If I don't go to my Best friend's Bali Birthday party?,"I want to preface this by saying that if I don't go I will still probably find time to treat her and get her a gift either before they leave for Bali or after they come back.

My friend recently decided to plan a destination birthday with our friend group, which I would not have minded if it wasn't in Bali. I am a bit of a clean freak and hate getting sick, so even though I think Bali would be fun, I'm mostly scared of Bali belly and being in a foreign country.

I think I'll kill the vibe because I like controlling certain things when I travel. I'd want to go to the more expensive hotels, I avoid going out after dark and I also don't like the club atmosphere/loud places/drinking. Buzz kill Ik. Now, I don't think she's crazy about those things either but she has started going out recently so it makes sense for her to want to celebrate a big birthday like this by doing that.

I ended up telling her that I had other travel plans with my family to visit my relatives overseas. This kind of always falls through every year and we never end up booking anything. I did tell her that nothing is booked yet but I wanna keep the dates open just in case which is ""true"" sort of. She seemed disappointed which is why I am writing this post. 

I want to emphasise that, I know this should be her day, so she should be able to do what she wants without anyone limiting that, I know I can't tell her what to do or where to celebrate so I chose to remove myself since I think either I will be uncomfortable or I will make my friend uncomfortable. On the other hand, If I don't go my best friend will celebrate her birthday without her best friend.

62,1g9c8jp,AITA for hiding my brothers laptop and telling him I threw it out?,"I (17m) have a younger brother (12m). I try to tell myself he isn't spoiled, because he has mental issues (ADHD/Autism and Anger issues), but at this point I'm convinced he's gaslight our parents into being obsessed with him. 

I have Narcolepsy and POTS, which causes me to need a wheelchair or walking aid of some sort most of the time. I am also legally deaf and wear hearing aids. My brother is extremely jealous of the fact that I have ""special treatment"" and makes it his biggest goal to be able to also have that kind of attention. There have been times where he has stolen my cane, hearing aids, and even my medication once, purely to show off to his friends for attention. 

About a week ago, he took my cane again and brought it to school. This time, he let some other kids borrow it, and it was broken (I have a foldable cane for easier transportation, and the kid snapped the cord inside of it, breaking it in half). I was extremely angry and yelled at him for it, but my parents took his side and brushed it off saying I shouldn't be so angry because he didn't understand that what he did was wrong due to his Autism. Usually I would give him the benefit of the doubt and believe it, but this is the third cane he has broken this YEAR.

I woke up yesterday morning to find one of my hearing aids broken, basically smashed. I knew exactly what had happened and decided I had dealt with enough. I waited for my brother to leave for school and then grabbed his laptop and hid it in an obvious spot I knew he wouldn't look and waited for him to get home, knowing he would instantly want to go on it when he got home.

Surprisingly, he didn't instantly barge into my room when he couldn't find it. I didn't hear or see him until dinnertime. My dad got home and instantly commented on the fact my brother wasn't on his laptop, and he broke down having a fit because he couldn't find it. I giggled to myself a little, but loud enough that everyone must have noticed because the room went silent and my brother was staring at me angerly. He demanded I tell him what was so funny, and I told him I threw it out this morning. Long story short, everyone was mad at me, and the rest of the night consisted of screaming and fighting.

I haven't told anyone where the laptop is, nor have I admitted to just hiding it. I was planning to put it back in his room or on the table after a few days, but now I am not sure what to do. I feel like its a harmless prank to teach him that stealing and breaking others important and personal belongings isn't okay, but my family is currently treating me like I committed a crime as bad as murder.

So today I was on the streetcar, and it was nearly empty—about 20 seats were available. I was sitting by the window, and this random stranger decided to sit right next to me. Naturally, I’m thinking, “Why sit right beside me when there are so many empty seats?” So I said, “Why did you sit next to me? There are so many other seats open. It’s just a little strange.” The guy shot back with, “Do you own this seat? I can sit wherever I want, you’re being unreasonable.” I told him, “Sure, I don’t own the spot. I just don’t get why you’d pick the seat right beside me when there are plenty of others.”

He basically repeated his point, and at that point, I decided to just get up and move because I didn’t want to escalate things. But in my mind, it felt like an unwritten rule of public transit that if there are lots of empty seats, you sit by yourself.

65,1g9brr3,WIBTA for bringing my roommate into my drama,"I (23F) lived with 3 other girls in college, ""Jane"" ""Maddie"" and ""Grace"". Maddie was my best friend. At the start of senior year, she started having a huge problem with Grace. Grace probably should have known what she did wrong but Maddie felt disproportionately betrayed bc of her past. I offered to move out with her but Maddie said she didn't want to. Jane kind of knew all of this was going on but didn’t know the details.

We  were also friends with “Sarah”. Because of all the drama in the apartment, I became really close with Jane and Sarah. Maddie also liked Sarah and would invite the three of us to hang out without Grace. Eventually, Maddie invited the three of us and our bfs to a day of graduation dinner. I had been making excuses but when she talked to my bf (now ex) about it, he told her we both thought it was mean and petty. Jane and Sarah both wiggled out without drama. She didn't speak to me for a week until I lied and said it was just him. She said she was over it.

More things happened and by graduation, I needed some space. I wanted to stay friends though, so we made plans to meet up once in June and once to see a comedian in August. Jane lives in Idaho so I booked a flight out to visit her too. With post-grad nostalgia, everyone was chatting in our larger friend group chat. Maddie would not respond because Grace was in the group chat and texted me, Jane, and Sarah to tell us that. I didn’t start convos in that group chat but I did respond.

For health reasons, I canceled in June. She said it was fine. I visited Jane in July. I then reached out to Maddie 4 times over 4 days. When she responded, it was to tell me I was a bad friend for everything above. I was angry and told her it was immature to let all of these things build up and then blow up. I explained everything and told her I was unhappy with how she handled it but still wanted to be friends in the future so she could call me if she wanted to talk. She didn't respond.

I assumed that she was mad at all of us, since only the visit was just me. However, I was talking to Sarah the other day and she told me that she had reached out with a ""just checking in!"" to see if Maddie was mad. She responded, fast and nice. I am so hurt to find out that all of this anger is only directed at me. This was someone who I thought was going to be my maid of honor. The fact that she would ice me out so hard and so fast for such petty reasons is making me reconsider my judgment and our whole friendship.

Here's where I could be the asshole. Ever since Sarah told me this, I've been wanting to ask Jane to reach out to Maddie. I know there's no real benefit and it's so petty and high school but I just need confirmation that it’s just me. At the same time, I don't want to drag Jane into it more.

When he didn't move I move his trolley a little bit so I could get past the end. I must have moved his trolley maybe 20 or 30 cm and the front was still against the counter so he could keep packing.

I was halfway out of the shop when he jeered at me and said some choice words like I had deeply offended him. I was very shocked and I turned around to take a photo but didn't say anything (turns out was in video mode). And then he proceeds to flip his middle finger.

OK so I understand if I was in the supermarket walking along and someone grabbed my trolley I would be offended. But he was so engrossed in his packing that he did not hear me trying to get past and obviously I didn't want to touch him. I didn't even notice I was there until I was 5 metres away.

Okay, so here’s the situation: 

I (19F) am getting married in a few months, and my sister (25F) recently started dating this guy, Jake. We don’t know each other well, but she surprised us by bringing him along to a recent family dinner, even though he wasn’t invited. The dinner was meant to be a serious discussion about the issues our family has been facing.

During dinner, my parents began opening up about some tough things they’ve been dealing with lately. My dad lost his job a few months ago, and my mom has been struggling with health issues. It was a heavy conversation, and you could see how much it affected them. My dad was obviously angry about the situation, and my mom looked flabbergasted when Jake jumped in with a joke, trying to lighten the mood. He said something like, “You guys are so overly dramatic. It’s like every little thing is a crisis! Can’t you all just lighten up a bit? I thought I was walking into a soap opera with all this tension. Family drama can be entertaining, but come on!”

His comment felt really disrespectful, especially when my parents were being so vulnerable. I could see my mom wanting to keep the peace and not draw attention to Jake’s rudeness, but it was hard to ignore. I called him out on it right then and there, but my sister just laughed it off, saying he was trying to be funny.

After that dinner, I decided I didn’t want him at my wedding. I told my sister that I wanted the day to be positive, and his comments made me uncomfortable. She got really upset and said I was being unfair, insisting that I should give him a chance because she really likes him.

70,1g9aq7j,AITA for pursuing getting my GED? ,"Hi Reddit! So I'm kinda in a bind and I could use some advice. I (16M) havé been struggling in high school for some time now, for some context, I'm not the most mentally healthy person in the world, I've been in and out of hospitals 3 times this year, and overall being in highschool has really fucked with me. 
I've been thinking about getting my GED for months now, and finally came to the conclusion it would be best for me. My plan is to get my GED take a year off from school to work and then go into community college. I decided to tell my parents, and my dad got really upset, for some more context, my dad skipped multiple grades and did very well in highschool despite his age difference with his classmates. He told me a lot of things including that I'd be a failure for doing this, and that he doesn't believe I will succeed, he ended it with telling me if I get my GED, he will never speak to me again after I move out. 
This is something I really want, and I'm thinking of doing it anyway, would I be the asshole if I got my GED even if it means I won't speak to my dad again after moving out?

I couldn’t deal with my current home situation anymore so I made the choice to leave. I am currently full time studying & working 2 days a week to pay my bills.

My friends who are all older & are still living at home but are always buying more than they can afford. I’ve realised that every single time I’ve been out with them, I am ALWAYS paying. I pay for the dinner, the maccas run, the drinks etc. I don’t mind if it was my shout or if I have invited them initially, but they usually are the ones who ask me to go out. I’m also the only one who has a car they own & always driving them around.

I’ve always believed kindness is selflessness but I’m now annoyed because it’s affected my finances a lot. Most times, they don’t even offer to pay or pretend to reach for their card.

76,1g99w4a,AITAH for telling the customer no after she vacuumed up her own vape at the car wash ,"Hello this is my first time doing something like this and I don’t wanna make this a lengthy thread so I’ll try to make it short and sweet. 

I (23 m) and my co worker (21 m) work at a car wash in the Tampa Bay Area. We at least try to give our up most respect to all of our customers. Yesterday (October 20th 2024) was a vary stressful day for all of us working at the car wash and to make matters worse the system that we use to open and close the gates wasn’t working due to hurricane Milton, so we had to do everything manually running to the gate to let people in to get their car washed and running to the wash entrance to load their cars in the wash, So it was already a stressful day for us and not to mention we have to run out to the vacuum station to grab towels fur customers. 


Anyways when I cashed out the last car at the gate I ran to the tunnel entrance to help my other co worker. As I was walking towards the tunnel I saw that a customer let’s call her rosé, so rosé goes up to my co worker yelling at him telling him that she sucked up her vape while she was using the vacuums. The vape was a skinny battery that you put pods in like a juul but not a juul. We tried to explain to her that we can’t just turn off the vacuums because that would mean that the 4 other cars right next to her can’t use the vacuums either and that the vacuums are split into two sections. So we told her politely that either she can wait until we close to grab your vape or you can just come back tomorrow and you can come grab your vape and will give you a free was (side note she was a member at our wash so I guess it didn’t really matter if she got a free wash or not.) she was taking no for an answer at this point. She was screaming at us telling us she needs her vape now and that she doesn’t care about the other customers. We told her we’re sorry but we’re not gunna shut off the vacuums for everyone else just to get your vape. In reality it would only take a few minutes and if she was the only one using the vacuums then I would but since there were 5-6 other cars using the same side vacuums as she was I’d rather have one person be mad at me then 5 others be mad at me.




Today I go on our google website and wrote a lengthy review saying that we were rude and disrespectful to her telling her no cause she lost something “vary important” to her. I vape myself but I wouldn’t be mad if I sucked up my own vape or at the very least be understanding then rosé was.

77,1g99w0m,AITA for not inviting and including my boyfriend’s daughter?,"I’ve been dating Jackson for about 8 months. He’s 33 and I’m 25. We met at the gym and 4 months later he asked me out. He’s really great but we had a disagreement the other day.

3 months into dating, Jackson told me he had a 10 year old daughter, Chloe, with his ex-fiancé. I knew he was previously engaged, but he never mentioned a daughter. Apparently he had her on weekends, but with moving and starting a new job, they agreed for him to just visit/take Chloe out when he was free. He had mentioned “Chloe” before and would often talk about taking her out with Eli (his nephew), so I assumed she was a niece. Since he was settled, they planned to go back to their original arrangement. I guess he thought that was the right time for me to know since it would eventually come up. 

I was upset originally. His reasoning was that he didn’t want us to meet until he got to know me. Which is fair, but I’m still of the belief that he could have told me he had a daughter sooner and still not have us meet. His logic is that a previous partner asked to meet Chloe right away and him being against that had caused a lot of arguing.

The current issue: My sister has been super busy with work and my BIL is in Manitoba since his dad had a mini stroke. So I have been babysitting my niece after daycare a lot. I love spending time with her and doing special activities together especially right now with everything happening. I’ve taken her to the aquarium and a few indoor playgrounds. 

I’ve gotten to meet and get to know Chloe on Jackson’s weekends these last 2 months. We were having dinner the other day when Jackson asked me what I was doing Wednesday. I told him I bought tickets for my niece and I to go to a local art fair. Chloe asked to go. I apologized and verbatim said “I’m sorry I can’t take you to the fair,, they don’t have anymore tickets but maybe we can go painting together with your dad next week.” She pouted a bit but basically just made me promise to take her. 

After dinner, I started trying to make plans when Jackson got upset. He wants me to take Chloe to the fair because “she could appreciate it more.” I said no because I was doing this specifically for my niece. Then he got mad I didn’t ask Chloe if she wanted to come. He said that I’ve been going out to do so many kid friendly activities but haven’t thought to invite Chloe. He thinks I’m not making an effort with her but like I’ve only known her for about 2 months. I think it’s unfair to expect me to be taking her out when I’m still getting to know her with him present.

My brother (22) and me (26m) moved together in a trailer in a small town lf >1000 for about 8 months. He had no job, no car, no license (even with me and our dad offering help multiple times) by the time we moved. So when bills stacked up, I got him a job at the place I managed. 

During these 8 months, his cat that meant the world to him went missing, he had an intense (type 1) diabetic seizure, and a small kitten he fell in love with died due to illness.

It's a small warehouse that packages tea products in bags and boxes. Very easy work. 
At first he was a little slow, and I pressured him to get faster but he expressed how it affected him negatively so I stopped. I told him to focus on quality then speed. 

But a few months later, he continued to be  very slow by doing projects his own way. That's usually fine, but it would take multiple hours longer than anyone else and even then would have to go back to fix time consuming mistakes. He would also show up in visibly dirty clothes with cat hair and diatomaceous earth (white powder to kill fleas) on his shorts. I told him multiple times that he has to wear clean clothes but he would brush me off never taking it seriously. 

During all this, at home, he wouldn't do any chores, let his own and stray cats come thru the cat door he installed which brought a shit ton of fleas (I'd constantly have 10 on me at a time just cooking breakfast), and ate some of my food without asking or replacing stuff we shared like eggs. I had no pets and would clean the kitchen/dishes semi regularly.

Finally, after he got into my car with dirty clothes I told him he had to either change clothes (I'd lend him some) or he would have to stay home. He complained and asked why it mattered. I told him food stafety. He chose to stay home. He later texted me “if you keep you keep going where you're going with your anxiety taking over you're gonna lose a brother. I'll go no contact”  
I told him thats his choice and to find another job while he's at it. He blocked me. 

A month later, he was 2 months behind on bills with me ($400+ now), no cleaning, not talking to me, and I had enough. I have the electrical box in my room so I turned off the power to his room when I got home. When he found out, he was livid. I told him he gets what he pays for, which recently has been nothing. He went through my stuff in my bathroom, broke it, and threw them across the front yard. 

He told me I don't know what he's going through. That he never stole my food. I don't remember much after beyond that.

I knew turning off the power would force him out and across the yard to my moms and her ex husband's trailer they share. My mom and my brother switched places (my mom was very happy about the switch, so was i) and it's been quiet since. 

He refuses to talk or look at me anymore.

My brother (22) and me (26m) moved together in a trailer in a small town lf >1000 for about 8 months. He had no job, no car, no license (even with me and our dad offering help multiple times) by the time we moved. So when bills stacked up, I got him a job at the place I managed.

80,1g99n4p,AITA for reminding my partner to wash/rinse dishes as he does them?,"My (33M) fiancé (31M) is habitually bad about doing dishes.  He'll just put them in the sink after he's/we're done using them, and silverware will just be left to soak in the dishes he leaves in the sink.

On the other hand, I always manually rinse and put up any dishes or silverware I use immediately after I'm done using them.  This comes from having lived for three years in dorms/apartments without dishwashers.  Even in my last apartment, which I lived in for five and a half years, which had a dishwasher, I almost never used it, preferring to wash dishes by hand as I use them for convenience's sake.

I routinely, though rarely, tell my fiancé that dishes would be a) easier to find and/or b) less gross if he simply washed/rinsed them and put them away immediately after using them instead of letting them soak and subsequently pile up.  The added result of this, of course, is that he'll occasionally get upset about the state of the (pile of) dishes in the sink.

Tonight, he was trying to find a particular fork, and I gently reminded him, though hesitantly (knowing that he really doesn't take well to being reminded about this), that this wouldn't be a problem if he simply stayed on top of washing and putting away dishes after he used them.

81,1g99m4h,AITA for leaving my sister and brother in law to rot in homelessness,"Last December, my sister, BIL, and niece were rendered homeless by 'no fault of their own' as they say. I'm coming to think it was very much a fault of their own considering how they treated me after I reached out my hand to get them a roof over our heads. Moved back to Florida after 10 years, used my credit to get what I thought was a quiet and safe place where my niece could get back into the school she's been to since Kindergarten, only for everything to go wrong on every angle. 

Let's start with the landlord and his 'Gestapo' made up of at least half the units in this 12 unit villa apartments. He emailed me a lease, I thought it was fine, then when I get here, after a 12 hour drive, he pulls out a second half of the lease full of fees. As much as I wanted to turn around and leave, I had no choice because it meant a home for my family. Later that night I'm just sitting out on my front stoop when I get asked 50 questions by some Proud Boys looking dude only to find out he's security detail. For a 12 unit complex you can see all of by just looking out your front door. Come to find out a lot of the apartments 'rented' here are being rented for free to the landlord's friends to spy on those not in his little inner circle. 

Sis/BIL immediately use this as an excuse to not get a job. Instead they doordash enough to make money to get them and just them fast food and weed. I tried discussing this leading to my BIL going into a psychotic episode. I called the police because he was smashing up the place and it sounded like he was beating my niece and sister. Cops didn't do shit because he said he was 'angry'. 

Then came Milton. We lost power for 4 days, I lost all my groceries, my landlord made sure his Gestapo had power back on the first night, I was offered a generator just hours before power came back on Sunday to 'save my food' but it would cost me an additional 500 dollars. Then my dumb ass let my sis/BIL use my car to go DDing as theirs had flooded. I was left in this apartment, not allowed to go outside because of the Gestapo, no food, no cool water... so I had a heat stroke. I felt my organs shutting down, I literally was too hot and fatigued to move, and when I called out for help from the neighbors they threatened to call the cops on me for disturbing their peace. While I was found by sis/BIL, they refused to call an ambulance because my BIL now thinks that he'll be put in prison for the rest of his life if we do. He makes sure to mention this daily. 

So here it is, end of the month, I can pay my part of the rent, they can't.

84,1g99dpg,AITA (32 male) for calling out my 17 year old sister?,"Some context:

My family is dysfunctional. My parents are divorced. They were both abusive in their own ways. My mom definitely did the most damage to the 2 of us. I've gotten a lot of therapy, but I'm definitely still affected by it.

With that said, I've become incredibly irritated with my sister over the years because I think she's becoming increasingly selfish and entitled. I don't want to give a laundry list of examples in the OP, so I'm just going to focus on our that might seem relatively trivial to some of you:

I told my sister that my company hands out free headphones, and that I MIGHT consider giving one to her boyfriend because his family helped out my sister in a great time of need (I won't get into the specifics -- I don't think it's relevant here).

However, I decided to give it to my dad instead. My sister, who knows that my dad will do anything she tells him to do, told my dad ""bro told me he was going to give the headphones to my boyfriend but he gave it to you and now I don't have anything to give to him for Christmas."" So my dad, because of his ridiculous personality, told her ""it's OK. I don't need it, give it to your boyfriend."" So she gladly took it.

That situation pissed me off but I didn't say anything about it until today when I (in retrospect, maybe regrettably) offloaded all these negative feelings I've had built up for her over the years with thinking she's acting entitled and selfish, and I brought up the headphone situation.

Her response was ""Also, who was the one who suggested giving it to my boyfriend? Cuz it wasnt me originally""

She intentionally didn't bring up the part where I told her that I was going to give it to dad instead and that I never said I was going to give one to her BF. I said I MIGHT.

I don't think she realizes how this particular response is incredibly manipulative. I don't think she's even trying to be, but it just affirms my opinion of her being entitled even more.

He is from a more well off family than mine, but we are both college students.

When we were just about done I asked if I could have a piece of the dark chocolate he had. This was great value brand dark chocolate before someone says well was it fancy German chocolate, no. To be clear, I had some dark chocolate too, but his was already opened, and I wanted a piece for the hot chocolate. He asked why I wanted some because he thought I already had some. Which is true, I explained that mine was still closed and that I just wanted a piece. However, seeing that he was reluctant I said never mind and then I brought up that I had bought most of the other things and given them easily to him, but when it came to his chocolate he did not want to give me any. I brought up how I felt like things were inconsistent and he said that he wasn’t saying no that he was just asking why I wanted some when I had dark chocolate. He said he would try to be more giving in the relationship and that he recognized that I had been getting a lot for him lately, but he had not been doing the same. I was trying to express that I was concerned with the imbalance, but hadn’t really spoken much yet. He then said he had serious concerns for our relationship because it is terrifying that I would get like this over him trying to say no over something so small. At this point, I said I was shocked because that was all that I felt in that moment. He then said he knows that I’m going to try to spin this on him and that I’m not sorry. I told him to please leave. I’m not sure what to make of this situation because maybe I did overreact over a piece of chocolate, but I don’t know, I have been feeling like there was an imbalance and at first I thought he understood that, but it didn’t turn out that way.

When we were just about done I asked if I could have a piece of the dark chocolate he had. This was great value brand dark chocolate before someone says well was it fancy German chocolate, no. To be clear, I had some dark chocolate too, but his was already opened, and I wanted a piece for the hot chocolate. He asked why I wanted some because he thought I already had some. Which is true, I explained that mine was still closed and that I just wanted a piece. However, seeing that he was reluctant I said never mind and then I brought up that I had bought most of the other things and given them easily to him, but when it came to his chocolate he did not want to give me any. I brought up how I felt like things were inconsistent and he said that he wasn’t saying no that he was just asking why I wanted some when I had dark chocolate. He said he would try to be more giving in the relationship and that he recognized that I had been getting a lot for him lately, but he had not been doing the same. I was trying to express that I was concerned with the imbalance, but hadn’t really spoken much yet. He then said he had serious concerns for our relationship because it is terrifying that I would get like this over him trying to say no over something so small. At this point, I said I was shocked because that was all that I felt in that moment. He then said he knows that I’m going to try to spin this on him and that I’m not sorry. I told him to please leave. I’m not sure what to make of this situation because maybe I did overreact over a piece of chocolate, but I don’t know, I have been feeling like there was an imbalance and at first I thought he understood that, but it didn’t turn out that way. Anyway, AITA?

86,1g98s9l,AITA for traveling to Japan with my first girlfriend instead of with my best friend? ,"Me (M30) and my best friend (M27) wanted to go to Japan for more than 5 years. It has been a huge dream for us and we wanted to travel there together and stay multiple weeks. I was ready to travel since day one, but he was super busy with university and had absolutely no money that he could have used to travel. And I didn't want to travel alone and we were both single. So I the beginning I always asked when we could finally travel there, but he always pushed it back to ""maybe next year"". Understandable because he had neither time nor money. I asked every year multiple times, and at some point he said that we can travel once he makes money after university. I was not happy with that, because I REALLY wanted to travel to Japan, and this meant that we could not travel there for at least a couple of years. Half a year ago he finally got his first job and started to earn money. It's a job at university so he's still a student, so he pushed it back again. He said we could probably travel to Japan after this job which would likely end in 2027. I am NOT happy to have to wait that long, but what can I do? I didn't want to travel alone.

Fast forward to today, I recently got my very first girlfriend and I am very sure that she will also my only gf. She really loves to travel and she knows about my dream to travel to Japan. Well, now we started to plan to travel there together in spring next year, and I am REALLY hyped to finally fulfill this dream. But once I told my best friend he was absolutely not happy with it. He called it a betrayal because we wanted to travel there together as soon as he has the money and time to do so. He called it ""bros before hoes"". And even if I would travel with again in 3 years, it would not be the same because I would have already been there instead of it been our first time in Japan.

Today she accused me of buying flowers for someone else that wasn’t her because I received mail from a flower company in my area that was addressed to my full name. It was some holiday brochure. I’ve never placed a purchase at this flower shop in my life so not sure why they put my name. I’m assuming they just looked up homeowners in the area.  

I started laughing after she kept asking me how they got my name, but I really didn’t know. It was just such a stupid thing. She however took this as me laughing at her and disrespecting her and got furious, so she stormed off.

These kind of crazy accusations come up frequently and they catch me off guard so I end up laughing at how ridiculous they are. I honestly can’t contain it. If she sees even the slightest smile out of me she loses it.

The 7 of us have become pretty close and have a tradition of surprising each other with fun little themed parties for special occasions like birthdays, etc.

One of our coworkers, Becca, had a baby 11 months ago and has not been the same since she came back from maternity leave. She's been extremely overwhelmed by everything (understandably so as a new parent!) and it has progressed to the point that our manager partially restructured our responsibilities because Becca couldn't accurately keep up with her tasks. Becca also has a pre-existing medical condition that makes processing information and details difficult. This was clearly exacerbated by the sleep deprivation, hormonal changes, and general stress of parenthood. We've all offered her help in both her personal and work life, trying to ease her load wherever we can. This includes last June when we had a small birthday party for one of us at work - we knew Becca was already overwhelmed so the other 5 of us did all the planning then asked Becca to contribute by picking up a cake on the way in.

I do all the grocery shopping, meal prep, cooking, and the massive cleanup afterward.

Last year, I asked for help, but everyone either ignored me or gave some lame excuse like, ""I’m not good in the kitchen"" or ""I don’t know how to cook."" Meanwhile, they’re sitting around while I’m running around the kitchen all day. After the meal? Same thing. They sit around chatting and drinking while I’m the only one cleaning up.

So this year, I said enough is enough. I told them I’m not hosting Thanksgiving. I suggested someone else step up, or we could split the cost of catering. Cue the drama. My siblings flipped out, complaining about how it’s ""tradition"" for me to host. My mom called me selfish, and my aunt said I was ruining Thanksgiving for the kids because they “love coming to my house.”

Now, they’re all upset with me, calling me lazy and saying I’m ruining the holiday. Honestly, I’m tired of being treated like their personal chef and cleanup crew every year, but now I feel guilty for putting my foot down.

90,1g97evg,AITA if I give my future sister in law a few more months to live here or no?,"To make a long story short, 7 months ago my brother's girlfriend moved in with us. Its my dad,sister,brother and I. They only been together a couple of months and asked if she could live with us. My dad and I said yes because we kind of felt bad because she never had a steady home her whole life, her mom is recovering from DA(but is doing good now, she has a job and her own apartment) and her dad is not in her life. However when she moved in with us my brother and her promised she would get a job or go back to school because she didn't finish high school(she's 18 btw and my brother is 21).  At first it was okay, because she still pay's rent but she gets SSI cause apparently she has a learning disability but now i regret it.



So now 7 months later she still hasn't had a job yet or gone to school yet. Apparently from what my brother told me she doesn't want to do either until she learns to drive and gets her license but she is not showing the motivation and Im kind of over it already, especially since my brother proposed to her and they are getting married next month. I had a conversation with my brother twice about this that he isn't financially stable for a marriage yet and that in this day and age both husband and wife need to work to survive financially and also that she needs to start doing something with her life
So i been thinking the last couple of weeks if i should give her a couple months to get a job or go back to school, If not she has to go with her mom.



Any advice on this??
I never been in situation like this before, where im basically kicking someone out.

However, it happened today and I can't help but wonder if I'm the asshole. So, me and my fiancee have been planning for awhile to get a cat just got one on Sunday, his mom and sister also got a cat at the same time as well. To note, we all live together but his sister goes to their dad's every other week for custody and we also already have two small dogs but they're his mom's. We all take care of the dogs as they're family dogs, so we all look after them. The day before us getting a cat, we asked his mom if we could get one and she said yes and asked if she could go to pick one out for his sister too. We said yea not thinking much of it and went on. We'll a little while later she asked if his sister could go so she could choose her cat and we again said yea no thinking about it but then the day of i had work from 5:30-12 and then we had to wait for his mom to get ready and then go pick up his sister since she was hanging out with friends. After we picked her up and we're heading on out way, his sister all of a sudden says she wants to see the cats we choose too and confused we say oh ok that's fine. We get there we all get out go in and start looking, we'll we see a few cats we want to see before asking a lady to bring them into a room so we can interact. After we do, his sister says that she wants to go with us to see the cat and we said ok confused again since she probably won't be getting this cat if we do choose them but say nothing and continue. During the interaction of the first cat we chose we didn't feel like there was a connection and the kitty just seemed stressed so we put her back and while looking for the next cat, his sister finds her cat she wants to look at but instead of asking to see her cat she wants so she could see ours again, but this second cat was the cats we chose and felt a connection towards, even in the keenels. So, after putting him back and looking around a bit more his sister decides to look at their cats that they got but we didn't and ended up adopting the second cat we seen. We didn't go see his sisters cat as we were doing paperwork and getting him ready to be taken home. So after we're done we go back to the car and his mom and tj are about done and end up adopting the cats they seen and interacted with. Then on the way home, we have their cats in a cardboard carrier and ours not, we didn't think about it and they didn't offer it, but they hissed at each other and we separated them (one up front and one in back) but when we got home his mom was insistent that we just let them all lose and it would be fine we did not and kept them separated for a few hours until we let them out and explore out of our rooms, but they hissed at our dogs and each other again. However, today they are doing good and our cat has adapted pretty well, while their cats has been doing ok and seems stressed as she keeps hiding away from everyone and doesn't want to come out unless she wants too which is fine I'm not going to force her out, it's up to a cat to decide how long their process is. Anyways, me and my fiancee were getting worried since today his sister is going back to their dad's, we feel like we are going to have to take all of the responsibility for the cat, we bout a small medium cat tree for our cat not expecting them to get their own cat, and they both seemed to expect that we put our cats stuff out in the living room for both cats, however this also has us worried as if we are going to move out in a year or so, the cats will get bonded to the cats tree and when we take it with us their cats won't have anything and they will still have to get one either way. However, its not even abiut the tree or anything we are just worried that the cat will get bonded to us since we are taking care of it and everything, when we didnt even want the cat. I tried explaining this to his mom, i said, ""im not trying to be mean or anything but me and fiancee are worried because when sister goes to her dads, we are going to be taking care of the cat and we are worried that the cat might get bonded with us and that we dont mind feeding her or like loving on her at all but"" and before I could say anything else she got mad and said she should go away before saying anything then called us selfish and the most self absorbed people she knows, is her judgment right? Are we assholes? If so I want to know so I can fix it but if not, what can I say for her not to get rid of the other cat and make her realize that it's not about the cat but its the fact that shes not our cat and we dont want to be the main caretakers",TL;DR,2024-10-22,"AITA For asking my fiancees mom if we can not be their cats main caretaker? Hi, I'm sorry if the title is confusing, I'm not too sure what to call or say this is. However, it happened today and I can't help but wonder if I'm the asshole. So, me and my fiancee have been planning for awhile to get a cat just got one on Sunday, his mom and sister also got a cat at the same time as well. To note, we all live together but his sister goes to their dad's every other week for custody and we also already have two small dogs but they're his mom's. We all take care of the dogs as they're family dogs, so we all look after them. The day before us getting a cat, we asked his mom if we could get one and she said yes and asked if she could go to pick one out for his sister too. We said yea not thinking much of it and went on. We'll a little while later she asked if his sister could go so she could choose her cat and we again said yea no thinking about it but then the day of i had work from 5:30-12 and then we had to wait for his mom to get ready and then go pick up his sister since she was hanging out with friends. After we picked her up and we're heading on out way, his sister all of a sudden says she wants to see the cats we choose too and confused we say oh ok that's fine. We get there we all get out go in and start looking, we'll we see a few cats we want to see before asking a lady to bring them into a room so we can interact. After we do, his sister says that she wants to go with us to see the cat and we said ok confused again since she probably won't be getting this cat if we do choose them but say nothing and continue. During the interaction of the first cat we chose we didn't feel like there was a connection and the kitty just seemed stressed so we put her back and while looking for the next cat, his sister finds her cat she wants to look at but instead of asking to see her cat she wants so she could see ours again, but this second cat was the cats we chose and felt a connection towards, even in the keenels. So, after putting him back and looking around a bit more his sister decides to look at their cats that they got but we didn't and ended up adopting the second cat we seen. We didn't go see his sisters cat as we were doing paperwork and getting him ready to be taken home.

96,1g964uy,AITA for asking my boyfriend not to wear crocs on dates,"Basically the title- My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) are medium/long distance (2 hours) and only see each other on the weekends. We’ve been going out to nicer restaurants and bars for dinners and going on cute dates. When we went apple picking, I asked him not to wear crocs because it’s muddy, slippery, etc. It started a mini argument but eventually he switched to boots. When we went out to dinner that night, he wore the crocs again.

We are planning our halloween costumes and the next time we see each other and I asked him if he would wear shoes other than crocs. More than just the functionality part, they just aren’t really what you wear when going to bars or eating at nice restaurants. 

He even admitted to not wearing crocs to school often (phd) as he “dresses nicer for school”. I think it’s fun picking out cute outfits I know he likes and doing my makeup when I get to see him. When I asked if he doesn’t like dressing up when we see each other, he said that it shouldn’t matter what you wear. Like yes, but also there’s a reason why people don’t wear crocs to weddings or job interviews. 

He feels like I am controlling him by asking him not to wear crocs, and I guess I am, but I feel like I’m going crazy trying to explain to him why crocs aren’t a shoe for every single occasion. I’m not trying to throw out his crocs or anything, but I just really like it when he dresses a little nicer and doesn't wear sweatpants and crocs out. 

He thinks that its superficial to care about what you look like and that he doesn't “think I look prettier” when I pick out outfit and do makeup. I love him and think he’s cute no matter what, but I really do love when I know he puts a little effort in.

98,1g95cfe,AITA for not letting my friend borrow my figure skates?,"For context, I (16f) figure skate. The season to skate with friends is approaching, so I have a bunch of friends who want to go to the local outdoor shopping center where they will be setting up an outdoor rink soon. I have a current pair that I use, and my old pair is broken down and not suitable for me to use for the skills I practice BUT suitable for simple skills/recreational things. They were formerly the skates I used for competition and practice etc. so they are WAY WAY better than recreational and rental skates most people may get just for one season.

Broken down just means that someone at a competitive level wouldn't use them (unless they want injuries ig) but these are skates that were $1000+ (!!) when they were purchased...so definitely good enough for casual skating even in their current condition.

My friend whose mom is really close with my mom wants to borrow my skates bc we want to take cute pics for insta and I said OK to her borrowing my old skates if they fit her feet. However, she wants to borrow my current skates because I mentioned that they were broken down and she seems to think that it means ""trash"".

My mom wants to let her borrow my current skates bc her mom keeps asking my mom to let my friend borrow them?? I said no but my mom said it's just skates and she will get me new ones anyway in a few months.

Yes I admit my mom said she would replace them especially since I probably have a couple of months left before they are broken down but I don't think anyone understands that even with the same skates + blades there is still some adjusting for me to do when I get new ones. 

But honestly the real issue is that my friend always get what she wants from me because my mom always tells me to be the ""bigger person"" especially since my friend has her own personal mental health issues. This is not the first time that I have had to sacrifice something for her and even worse, she will always end up copying me by getting the same thing later. It's not an issue about money FYI cause we are all in a well-off area but I just don't like being copied cause I'm weird like that?? My mom says I should let those kind of things go because friendship is more important than my ego.

101,1g956gp,AITA for saying what I said to my classmate through email?,"I (22F) am in a uni doing an undergrad. For this uni, a grade of 80%-84% is an A minus (3.7), and 85%+ is a 4.0. Last year (Sep 2023-Apr 2024), I did a research project course which I found difficult due to my supervisor's research associate disliking me. In 2nd semester of last year (Jan 2024-Apr 2024), I met this girl Wang in a course called Enviro and X. She was also in another course Special Topics and Y. I dropped the Enviro course and will be graduating in spring 2025 due to mental health. 

Wang was also in the research project course but working with a different project supervisor for it. I introduced myself to her in the former. Then, I decided to share why I was happy that day. Looking back, this was stupid of me because I barely knew her at the time but I was so excited that I just couldn't contain myself. I shared that I had been doing better than I expected in the research project course, as I had been getting 80% at the time (A- where I'm from). She then went ""OOOH YOU HAVE THE WRONG SUPERVISOR! EVERYONE IN THAT CLASS IS GETTING 90'S!"" She had a huge smirk on her face and her tone of voice was like she had just discovered a juicy piece of hot celebrity gossip. I was caught off guard by this. I said nothing but gave her a look and turned away, ending the convo. 

The research project course ended in April 2024 and my mark was 83% or A-. The course average was A-. Only the letter grade is shown for the course average.

I wasn't sure if Wang was planning to graduate in spring 2024. Now, I am in this one online course this semester with Wang. We can see everyone's school email account online. I saw her's. The format for all school emails is [firstname.lastname@mail.schoolname.ca](mailto:firstname.lastname@mail.schoolname.ca)

I have social anxiety and communicating online is easier than in-person for me. I don't usually do well with confrontation. I decided to send her an email saying something along the following lines: ""IN UR FACE! U WERE WRONG! THE CLASS AVERAGE WAS A-, SO NO NOT EVERYONE WAS GETTING 90'S OR ELSE THE CLASS AVERAGE WOULD'VE BEEN HIGHER! IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WHY WERE THERE RUBRICS IN THE FIRST PLACE. KARMA'S A BITCH! MAYBE U WERE THE ONE WITH THE WRONG SUPERVISOR ALL ALONG! U WEREN'T THE TEACHER HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW EVERYONE'S GRADES"" and I made the username ""R3dd1t3xp0s3r0fBull13s"" and added ""I saw how you made my best friend feel that day. She looked so hurt when you said what you said""

I have been to mental health professionals when I was younger. My mom acts kinda crazy sometimes, especially when I would keep secrets from her. If mom knew what Wang said to me in Enviro, she would FREAK OUT on me for not telling her about it. She freaked out on me before when I was 12 and getting bullied and my friend snitched on me to mom for not telling mom about the bullying. Therefore, I had to feel like I was in control of the situation and not letting Wang walk over me and I did what I did. AITA?",TL;DR,2024-10-22,"AITA for saying what I said to my classmate through email? I (22F) am in a uni doing an undergrad. For this uni, a grade of 80%-84% is an A minus (3.7), and 85%+ is a 4.0. Last year (Sep 2023-Apr 2024), I did a research project course which I found difficult due to my supervisor's research associate disliking me. In 2nd semester of last year (Jan 2024-Apr 2024), I met this girl Wang in a course called Enviro and X. She was also in another course Special Topics and Y. I dropped the Enviro course and will be graduating in spring 2025 due to mental health. 

Wang was also in the research project course but working with a different project supervisor for it. I introduced myself to her in the former. Then, I decided to share why I was happy that day. Looking back, this was stupid of me because I barely knew her at the time but I was so excited that I just couldn't contain myself. I shared that I had been doing better than I expected in the research project course, as I had been getting 80% at the time (A- where I'm from). She then went ""OOOH YOU HAVE THE WRONG SUPERVISOR! EVERYONE IN THAT CLASS IS GETTING 90'S!"" She had a huge smirk on her face and her tone of voice was like she had just discovered a juicy piece of hot celebrity gossip. I was caught off guard by this. I said nothing but gave her a look and turned away, ending the convo. 

The research project course ended in April 2024 and my mark was 83% or A-. The course average was A-. Only the letter grade is shown for the course average.

I wasn't sure if Wang was planning to graduate in spring 2024. Now, I am in this one online course this semester with Wang. We can see everyone's school email account online. I saw her's. The format for all school emails is [firstname.lastname@mail.schoolname.ca](mailto:firstname.lastname@mail.schoolname.ca)

I have social anxiety and communicating online is easier than in-person for me. I don't usually do well with confrontation. I decided to send her an email saying something along the following lines: ""IN UR FACE! U WERE WRONG! THE CLASS AVERAGE WAS A-, SO NO NOT EVERYONE WAS GETTING 90'S OR ELSE THE CLASS AVERAGE WOULD'VE BEEN HIGHER! IF THAT WAS THE CASE, WHY WERE THERE RUBRICS IN THE FIRST PLACE. KARMA'S A BITCH! MAYBE U WERE THE ONE WITH THE WRONG SUPERVISOR ALL ALONG! U WEREN'T THE TEACHER HOW WOULD YOU EVEN KNOW EVERYONE'S GRADES"" and I made the username ""R3dd1t3xp0s3r0fBull13s"" and added ""I saw how you made my best friend feel that day. She looked so hurt when you said what you said""

102,1g956d0,AITA for telling my friend's GF about his drug abuse,"Long story short, my best friend was away visiting his girlfriend in another country, they've known eachother for many years and are quite close with one another. When he told me he was using hard drugs with some dude he met a few days ago in a bar, I got worried. He has a history of abusing substances to cope with his depression and stress, so this was a massive red flag for me. 

He sent me and a few of our friends in common videos of him snorting some green powder with the guy in his apartment, he later told me it was Alpha/Flakka, so I called his girlfriend and told her that he might be in trouble and that she should go get him and take him home. He never did these sorts of drugs before and the OD threshold is really low for first time users so that's why I was worried.

Now he's mad at me and our friends (we all agreed to get him help) for ""ruining his relationship"" when he was the one who left his GF alone in her apartment to go do drugs with some random guy.

Another guy came over and stood next to my bench and started doing curls with a 25-pound plate. While I was in the middle of my set, he placed his plate flat on one of the arms of my bench, directly under my left arm. 

Confused, I stopped and paused my music and asked, ""Could you not put your weight on my bench?""

He said, ""It's not even in your way.""

If I extended my left arm all the way, I would not actually hit his plate, but it would be about six inches away. Still, it was in my space, on my bench that I was actively using, and very distracting. Plus, if it was nudged, it would fall at my feet.

""It is in my way, please take it off,"" I said.

He grew enraged and called me a pussy and said I must use pronouns, and it was at that point that I pushed play on my music and tried to ignore him. I continued my set, but in the mirror, I watched him bark at me for a solid 30 seconds, right next to my face, until he finally walked away. Keep in mind this was at 6:15 a.m.

105,1g9wuyx,AITA for not offering my mom a place to live when she is about to be homeless?,"I (30F) have a complicated relationship with my mother, who suffers from bipolar disorder, depression, and anxiety due to trauma she experienced when she was younger. Growing up, her mood swings made it difficult for her to hold jobs, so my stepdad was the main provider, and we often struggled financially.

At 18, I moved out, worked multiple jobs, and went to college, eventually building a stable life. My mom and stepdad divorced, which was a relief as their relationship had become abusive. Shortly after, she moved to Florida with her long-time best friend /now new bf. Periodically while down there I would help her with some money here and there but nothing big.

In early 2020, I met my amazing fiancé. That same month, my mom moved from Florida to Arkansas due to the high cost of living. She needed money for the move, so I lent her $4,000 from my savings. Over the next two years, her relationship with her bf became more volatile. In 2022, my fiancé and I decided to move in together. On moving day, my little brother called for help because he had become homeless due to some poor decisions. We decided to let him move in to give him time to save and get on his feet, but after a year, I discovered he was using meth, and I had to kick him out.

After he got out of rehab, my mom wanted to come back to help my brother, claiming it was a good time since she was being kicked out of her friend’s house, but she didn't have the funds. I offered to pay for her relocation if she left her abusive boyfriend, she agreed, and I sent her $3,000. Once back, she moved in with my brother, but she brought her bf with her. Things quickly deteriorated again as they all started using drugs, leading to my brother losing the apartment I had helped him get. My mother and her bf went to live in a friend's trailer and my brother went back to rehab.

Months later, my mom called me bawling saying she was being kicked out again, and I offered to cosign on an apartment if she left him as a last lifeline to get on her feet without him. Initially, things seemed hopeful, but then I received a call from the police about a physical fight that broke out between her and her bf who lived there. Over the next year, things escalated, and she lost her job. I had to pay for rent multiple months and bills as she did not have the money to do so, adding up to $4,000+ of additional expenses. When 'our' lease was up in May, I removed myself from it, stating it was her responsibility. Since then, she hasn’t paid rent and is going to be kicked out this week.

She hasn’t asked to live with me, and I haven’t offered because honestly, I’m burnt out from helping. My fiancé supports my decision not to help further, knowing it would strain our relationship and impact my mental health. Yet, I feel like a bad daughter for not helping. Despite her mistakes, I believe she’s a good person at heart.

My wife has had a lot of issues with comments my mother has made in the past. One thing that still causes her a lot of anger are some things my mother asked me 9 years ago. When we were dating, my wife was 22 and had started going to community college at age 21. My mother expressed to me that she was concerned this could mean that she didn’t have life ambitions and was concerned that she wouldn’t be a good life partner. I told my mother that this wasn’t true, because she had gotten into all the colleges she wanted at age 17, but had been in foster care and had no one to co sign loans and had no way of getting any financial aid, so she started working until she could put herself through school. When I told her this my mother understood and agreed with me and never brought it up again. Later, I went through a period where I was pushing my then girlfriend (now wife) away, and I mentioned what my mother had said and I accused her of not having of life ambitions. I was completely in the wrong for this and have apologized for it many times, and she forgave me for this, and that’s not what this post is about. Not only had she put herself through school but she was the youngest manager at the store she worked at, at the same time.

She went on and on about this and said it multiple times in different, equally demeaning ways.

Im praying someone on Reddit can help. As a known crazy person I need to be told not to wild out. But please tell me why my fiancés 22 y/o female coworker, showed him porn. At work. With a witness. I don’t know how to react. For more information myself and my fiancé just turned 23. Yesterday my fiancé came home and told me his coworker Australia(22F) and another coworker were waiting until the clock out in a shared common area. She then pulled out her phone  and showed my fiancé a video of a woman recieving backshots. He said Woah hey what are you doing. The other coworker said hey what was it. They’re reaction after seeing the phone was indifferent. They said Oh. It was another male coworker. My fiancé took her aside and explained that he did not appreciate that and that wasn’t okay. She apologized. She then went home spoke to her BOYFRIEND, and he agreed she was wrong and that she could be reported. She tell my fiancé this after he requests to be put on a seperate route than she. She pulls him aside and apologizes. 

I still think she should be reported. Am i the asshole?

110,1g9vh28,AITA is my mother the asshole or are we both?,"My younger brother (26) and me (33f) were raised by my grandmother (would have been 94 this year) since birth, we had been living with her on and off since. Mother moved out of the family home in 2003 to be with her boyfriend, we hardly saw her since.



we were always part of each others life, as we lived together as a family. then,



in 2017 i received carer payment to care for her as her health was getting bad, namely hip arthritis and heart problems, in the same year i moved out to be closer to university whilst living with my boyfriend at the time.



In July 2022 my boyfriend at the time (now ex) had cheated on me, I missed out on spending the Christmas of 2022 with my grandmother because i decided to stay at my fathers place with depression for the whole month of December and January



She got sick with hallucinations and was now unable to walk, she was sent hospital for 3 months July through to October. A social worker called me and asked me questions about her care, and i told her that i was angry because my mother isnt helping. I tried to convince them that my grandmother needed to be in her home and i would pay for extra carers to help. they refused.



then the next month they sent her to a nursing home, she was extremely unhappy there, she couldnt speak much or move



i spent the past 2 months mainly in my room with depression. i had visited her 3 times only during these 2 months.



Then i had a call suddenly on the 3rd of January this year, the lady at the nursing home said that i should visit my grandmother quickly that she was unwell.



When i arrived to the nursing home, she had a stroke and count not move.I slept next to her during the day until the night and she passed away sadly that night.



More info: My grandmother has 3 children, one uncle who lived 15 minutes away from us, who tricked her into signing away her property in 1985, and who only visited her 3x per year on easter, mothers day and Christmas. My mother who has been leeching off my grandmother since she had to my brother and i, and who was verbally abusing her since i was born, and another uncle who left for the U,K before i was born, who never returned and would send a postcard once a year to her.



My mother (66) had multiple opportunity to receive the carer payment but refused as it was too low and she chose to work in a dress shop instead, and she also had over $100,000 in her bank account from her superannuation, meanwhile i had no savings as i was trying to make a life for myself at the same time. My grandmother was also receiving $500 a week for herself, i never asked for money from her, she used this money how she chose.



I spent half my payment on my grandmothers groceries, the other half on my own fuel, my own groceries, my rent and supplies for university. The carers payment doesnt require the carer to live with the person to be cared for. I could barely get by with $500AUD per week as it was.

118,1g9uh99,AITA for not adding an extra $1 to my delivery driver’s tip after saying I would?,"I live with a hyperactive dog. I had had a long day so far and wanted to order some food. Ordinarily I would’ve just driven to a restaurant to pick up some food, but I was in the middle of working so I ordered delivery.

It’s important to note that when I said my dog is hyperactive, I mean he is VERY aggressive and anxious. He gets very territorial and if he sees ANYONE drive past our house he goes absolutely crazy. (And before you say anything— he’s seen about 6 trainers and all of them say he’s a lost cause.) So when I order anything to our house, I need to be prepared to keep him away from the windows until it arrives and they drive away. Still, though, just to ensure he’s placated, I ALWAYS put in the delivery instructions, “Plz do not leave food at front door! Leave by garage door OR mailbox instead. + Do not knock or ring doorbell— dog will go crazy. I will add $1 to tip if you do this, thx!”

After I placed the order I waited for the driver to pick up my food. Then I texted him 2 messages: “Hi! Thanks so much, please leave the food by the garage door or mailbox!” and then “I will add $1 to tip.” He didn’t respond. 

When he was about 2 minutes away I called him just to be safe. He didn’t answer that either. I pulled my dog away from the window and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, my dog looked through the front door window and saw someone walk up, ring the doorbell AND knock (which just felt unnecessary), and leave the food up front. My dog, of course, went crazy and peed all over our couch and rug and it took several minutes to clean up and calm him down.

Irritated, I reported the problem with the driver to the app. I will admit this wasn’t entirely necessary but I was very frustrated. All I said was “Driver did not follow delivery instructions despite multiple reminders.” I also, admittedly, sent a message to the driver that said, “Thanks a lot.”

About 5 minutes later I get a message from him that reads, “?” and then “Where is the extra $?” I tried to be very kind as I said, “I told you I would only add $1 to the tip if you followed instructions.” He immediately got upset with me, saying that he delivered to the right general location and the special delivery instructions are never a guarantee. He then said that when he read the second message saying “I will add $1 to tip” he assumed that meant he was getting an extra $1 regardless. I told him I thought I had made it clear that the $1 was conditional. He got fed up, claiming “It’s just one dollar” and said was going to report me.

It is worth noting, however, that I tipped pretty well— $9 on a less than $30 order— so I feel as though he overreacted, too. Also, the instructions weren’t that hard to follow. But it was JUST a dollar… Idk. Am I the asshole?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-22,"AITA for not adding an extra $1 to my delivery driver’s tip after saying I would? I live with a hyperactive dog. I had had a long day so far and wanted to order some food. Ordinarily I would’ve just driven to a restaurant to pick up some food, but I was in the middle of working so I ordered delivery.

It’s important to note that when I said my dog is hyperactive, I mean he is VERY aggressive and anxious. He gets very territorial and if he sees ANYONE drive past our house he goes absolutely crazy. (And before you say anything— he’s seen about 6 trainers and all of them say he’s a lost cause.) So when I order anything to our house, I need to be prepared to keep him away from the windows until it arrives and they drive away. Still, though, just to ensure he’s placated, I ALWAYS put in the delivery instructions, “Plz do not leave food at front door! Leave by garage door OR mailbox instead. + Do not knock or ring doorbell— dog will go crazy. I will add $1 to tip if you do this, thx!”

After I placed the order I waited for the driver to pick up my food. Then I texted him 2 messages: “Hi! Thanks so much, please leave the food by the garage door or mailbox!” and then “I will add $1 to tip.” He didn’t respond. 

When he was about 2 minutes away I called him just to be safe. He didn’t answer that either. I pulled my dog away from the window and hoped for the best. Unfortunately, my dog looked through the front door window and saw someone walk up, ring the doorbell AND knock (which just felt unnecessary), and leave the food up front. My dog, of course, went crazy and peed all over our couch and rug and it took several minutes to clean up and calm him down.

Irritated, I reported the problem with the driver to the app. I will admit this wasn’t entirely necessary but I was very frustrated. All I said was “Driver did not follow delivery instructions despite multiple reminders.” I also, admittedly, sent a message to the driver that said, “Thanks a lot.”

About 5 minutes later I get a message from him that reads, “?” and then “Where is the extra $?” I tried to be very kind as I said, “I told you I would only add $1 to the tip if you followed instructions.” He immediately got upset with me, saying that he delivered to the right general location and the special delivery instructions are never a guarantee. He then said that when he read the second message saying “I will add $1 to tip” he assumed that meant he was getting an extra $1 regardless. I told him I thought I had made it clear that the $1 was conditional. He got fed up, claiming “It’s just one dollar” and said was going to report me.

Nothing has happened as far as I know yet, but while what I did felt right in the moment, I’m not quite sure I reacted appropriately. It is worth noting, however, that I tipped pretty well— $9 on a less than $30 order— so I feel as though he overreacted, too. Also, the instructions weren’t that hard to follow.

121,1g9teuo,AITA for letting my MIL stay overnight without my husband knowing?,"My husband 'John' (26M) and my MIL 'Sarah' (59F) don't have a close relationship. They got along very well just aren’t a boy mum duo a lot of people are.
A week ago, Sarah called me in the middle of the night saying she was in town and she was drunk. She told me she'd tried calling John but got no reply which made sense since he is a nurse and works pretty late most nights and has his phone switched off while he works. I told her l'd go get her and drove to pick her up. She was very thankful and stayed in the guest room.
I stayed up a little longer just to make she she didn't come out the room again (she was very drunk so would've probably made a mess if she got to the kitchen or something) and then went to sleep when I was sure that Sarah was also asleep. 
I woke up early the next morning and my husband, bless him, was already up and due for another shift. John is over worked but usually is in a good mood in the morning.
That morning he had a weird look on his face He asked me who was in the guest room (we only close the guest room door if someone is staying over).
I told him it was Sarah and he blew up on me saying he suspected it was because of the missed calls from the night before so but he didn't want to believe it.
John told me l'd completely crossed a line and that I couldn't just let his mum come and go as she pleased. He said “I’ve been dealing with bullshit all day and now I gotta take it from you too?”
John has never been uncaring towards his mum like that in front of my before and had never yelled at me before like he did that morning. We argued and it was awful, I’ve never been so upset at him before. He told me we’d speak properly about it when he got back from work and I’d ‘calmed down’. 
We didn’t speak about it when he got back from work we talked about it last night. He told me he was ready for my apology and I told him he wasn’t going to get one because I see nothing wrong with what I did. He had no reason to scream at me, he should be welcoming to his own mum. I texted his brother a few days asking if maybe they had an argument I didn’t know about and he said hadn’t heard if they’d argued. We argued again, he told me I’d completely crossed his boundaries. I told him he was overreacting and he told me I was intentionally ignoring how inappropriate my behaviour was. I don’t know what I’ve done and we are still being icy to each other.
So am I the asshole? Should I apologise? Am I missing something here?


EDIT: to clarify since some people are making alot of assumptions about ‘Sarah’ and my husband’s relationship let me be so very clear; SHE IS NOT AND HAS NEVER BEEN ABUSIVE, THEY ARE ON VERY GOOD TERMS JUST NOT EMOTIONALLY CLOSE.

122,1g9t8ty,AITA for letting the cops into the house to do a wellness check on my mother?,"I live in a house with my two brothers, my little brother's boyfriend, and my mother. Last night was normal. I was prepping for a new online job and talking to friends. My mom had been out helping a friend, Jamie, whose mother has progressed Alzheimer's. My mom helps Jamie's mother when Jamie can't due to work.

My mom doesn't get paid but uses Jamie's car to attend classes. She's obligated to help because of this. It was around 2 A.M. when I noticed my mom hadn't been home. I called her, and she sounded like she was slurring her words, which worried me. I asked if she was drunk (she's been sober for almost a year). She said no, and we talked. She said she was staying over because it was too late to drive.

Ten minutes later, Jamie called, saying everything was okay and she didn't get my mom drunk. It made me more suspicious, but I didn't say anything and agreed with her. I wanted to go to bed and hoped she wasn't drinking while on anti-depressants.

I went to bed and woke up to what seemed like a normal day. Until my brother told me there was a missing person's report on our mother. Confused, we called Jamie. Apparently, early in the morning, my mom had a manic episode and called a Lyft. We were all worried. She finally got back and locked herself in her room. Then I saw cops at our door, and I panicked.

The cops asked if we had seen our mother. I said yes, and they asked to come in. They said it was for a wellness check to see if she needed to be on a psych hold. The missing person's report wasn't filed by us but by Jamie, with more information than I knew. The cops went in, talked to my mom, and she felt betrayed. She was sober and gave me dirty looks, calling us names and saying she wasn't going to hurt herself.

The cops took her to the patrol car. I spoke to an officer who said there were scratch and bite marks on her wrist from earlier. I don't know what she was trying to do, but I wanted to make sure she was safe. Apparently, she had a few sips of alcohol while on anti-depressants. I'm having a hard time processing this and feel filled with dread.

I told her she’s being childish with this whole copying thing, like we’re almost adults. but she didn’t seem to care and just shrugged again, so I got upset kind of yelled at her that i don’t want to be her friend anymore if she’s going to be like this. she looked hurt but I just stormed off and went home.",2.0,0.09515142440795898,0,0
126,1g9s3ym,AITA for uninviting my friend to concert because she wanted to bring her girlfriend,"I (24F) bought two tickets to a concert and I invited my friend (23F) to see it with me free of charge since we both like artist and she’s taken me to concerts for free before. I texted my friend a couple times over a few weeks asking if she wanted to go to the concert with me, with no response. My friend has a pattern of not responding to messages/calls and being generally unreliable, so it’s not unusual for her to take months to reply. I considered giving her ticket to someone else, but ultimately decided against it in case my friend did end up wanting to go. I purchased the tickets in July and finally in September my friend responded and said she was in for the concert, so I was glad I didn’t give her ticket away. 

Flash forward a few weeks to now and the concert is this weekend, just a few days away. I texted my friend earlier this week to confirm plans. A couple days later she responds to ask if her girlfriend can come if she can buy her a seat next to ours. I said “of course!” but was skeptical since I purchased our original two tickets months ago and seats were selling fast back then, so I didn’t think there would be a seat close to us available less than a week from the concert. But I trusted the process. 

Lo and behold, there were no seats available next to the original two I purchased. My friend managed to find and purchase a seat in the same section, but it was 8 rows down from our original two seats. My friend then suggests that I give my seat to her girlfriend so they can sit together while I sit by myself in the seat 8 rows down. To that I said “if I wanted to sit by myself I would’ve only bought one ticket lol”. We went back and forth a little bit about how I thought the girlfriend shouldn’t come if we can’t all sit together and how my friend had already spent the money for her ticket so she was coming. 

I admit that I escalated things and got petty, but I was already frustrated that this was happening days before the concert when I’ve been trying to plan this for months. I ended up saying something to the effect of “if you’re too insecure to spend one night away from your girlfriend then maybe you both should stay home and I’ll ask someone else to go with me.” Not my finest moment, but honestly it’s how I feel. I should’ve just asked someone else to go from the start, but I really wanted this fun night with my friend. AITA?

127,1g9riav,AITA if I ask my father and his mother to stop using the car or decrease their use of the car ,I 20f bought my car 10 months ago and I found If I added my father to the insurance it would be cheaper. However I did not expect him to drive my car. My father who does not have a car started to ask for small favours here and there but it has become nearly everyday now. My grandmother has also started to ask for the use of my car for my father to do things such as pick her up to go shopping or hospital appointments etc however my grandmother does have a car but she does not like driving and my father is not on the insurance of her car. The reason why I would want them to stop using the car if for mainly two reasons it clashes a lot with when I need to use my car and they do not pay for the petrol they use and when they do which is rarely they only put back the amount of petrol they used for that day. The reason why I think am in the wrong is because my grandfather (my grandmother husband) used to take me and my sister when we was kids to a lot of things probably going in his car once a week and there was never paying him back with petrol.

128,1g9qrwx,AITA for demanding an apology and wanting permission for my things being taken?,"For context me (f23 and my boyfriend (m22 have been together for 3yrs. When we got together i was gifted a vintage b0ng, and i had it for about a year before it inevitably broke. My boyfriend bought me one a little over a year ago, it was a handmaid almost identical replica of my vintage one, and cost nearly 200$ to be made by an independent artist. This was given to me as a Christmas present at the time, and we mutually agreed that we wouldn't take it to other peoples' houses, ESPECIALLY not without me.

Fast forward to today, i went to work and my boyfriend was supposed to go over to the connections house to paint walls, and unbeknownst to me, he took my b0ng.
Without asking and without letting me know.
Upon calling and asking wtf, why, and when it would be back, he told me to - quit ""being over dramatic"" and that he never takes it out, so i need to chill, because he's out making us some money right now - he also said it shouldn't matter bc it's ""our b0ng"".

The problem is i don't see it that way! I see that he broke my only rule regarding an expensive sentimental piece/gift, and that he's claiming it as his gift too to justify it, even though it was bought FOR ME for CHRISTMAS.

Only reason i think i could be wrong, is because im absolutely refusing to let this go, and i put my foot down, while he says i should get over it.
Should i get over it? Should i stay firm on my boundaries?
Am i wrong for refusing to let this go, and for wanting an apology going forward, plus another agreement in place that he will ask before taking it??",Not the A-hole,2024-10-22,"AITA for demanding an apology and wanting permission for my things being taken?
