0,1g97182,UPDATE: AITAH for not letting a family member enter pictures I took into a contest under their name?,"this is an update to a previous post found here [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ev871x/aitah\_for\_not\_letting\_a\_family\_member\_enter/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1ev871x/aitah_for_not_letting_a_family_member_enter/)

In case no one read the original here's a TLDR: I had a family member who wanted to enter the photos I took of the Grand Teton's into a local photo contest because I didn't qualify. I don't want to do it and my family thought I was the asshole.

Here's the update. So I took the advise of a lot of the commentors and told my family I wouldn't allow anyone else to enter my pictures under their name, then made sure my family member didn't enter my photos without my permission by attending the contest and threatening to report them if they tried. I've also taken to not sending around any of my pictures without a watermark. I used some of the arguments given in the comments to justify my decision, and while my family still didn't agree, they let it go and stopped pressuring me to send them all the original pictures. I know some people suggested I tell the contest organizers, but I didn't think it was worth going that far. Man, I probably should have.

So, more recently one of my aunts also got into photography and sent around a lot of pictures she took on a vacation to New Orleans. Well, my plagiarizing family member took them and entered them into a contest in the local paper (small town) under her own name and won. The picture was featured in the paper and referenced only her as the photographer along with a quote by her. I don't think the rest of us would have even found out about it if my uncle didn't like to read the paper everyday.

Now my aunt is angry and so is the rest of the family. I am kind of curious if they would have reacted this strongly for me, but it doesn't really matter. At least now my family understands why I reacted as strongly as I did.

EDIT: for everyone saying I should report her to the paper, I would if I thought it would make a difference. Sadly, my family member’s boyfriend is the biggest sponsor for the local paper so I don’t think they’d risk losing his funding.
