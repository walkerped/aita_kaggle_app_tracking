They've known each other since they were 4, grown up together, always been best friends. She had a problem with me when I started dating Lily but she never gave me a reason why. Lily and me have always had a happy relationship and were friends before we dated, but I didn't rlly know amy until we got together.

To my knowledge she's been single for a while and I've always kind of got the impression that's she's jealous of Lily, but obviously Lily doesn't see it like that. Amy picks on what she wears, how her hair is, occasionally suggests to her that she's eating too much, little shit like that. It's always pissed me off. Amy's always made comments to Lily about how she thinks I'm too close with some of my friends who are girls and that I'm not right for her.

Yesterday Lily decided that it was time for me and Amy to form a blossoming friendship and so we all went to a bar together. When we got there she asked Lily why she was wearing the skirt she was because it ""really isn't flattering"". She looked stunning. I didn't say anything to Amy at that point, so I went and got the first round for us all. When Lily went to buy herself a coke a while later (she said she'd drive) Amy made a comment about why I wasn't paying for her drinks.

I decided I didn't want to keep my mouth shut anymore and told Amy that she needed to get a life and stop worrying so much about our relationship. She kind of looked shocked and was like ""wdym"" so I told her that the side comments were shitty and that she was being a bad friend.

We all went back to our respective places after. Lily said I was too harsh and that Amy was her best friend and I need to respect that. She also said that Amy had been having a hard time recently and should probably apologise to her. I know I could have worded it better or taken her aside to chat about it but I was just done with the whole thing and don't think Lily deserves to be treated like shit. AITA?

2,1gaj9r8,AITA for not allowing stable hands to ride my horse?,"This happened about a week ago but I was hesitant about posting on here due to how I saw people reacting to another horse related post but I‚Äôm really in need of unbiased opinions.

So I (20F) am leasing a horse (Sputnik) and have been for almost two years. Leasing a horse is essentially paying to borrow someone‚Äôs horse. I have a full time lease so I have access to Sputnik 24/6. His owner has a deal with the barn owner where her livery costs will be lowered if she allows him to be used in riding lessons. They have group lessons on Sundays and he is always used for them. This is not something I have a problem with.

The barn owner allows some of the girls to do some yard work in exchange for riding a horse for free. Sputnik is a very popular horse among the stables and a lot of them choose to ride him. This is where my issue arises. I spend ‚Ç¨80 a week for Sputnik. While I understand him being used on Sundays, I think it‚Äôs unfair to have other people ride him for ‚Äúfree‚Äù. On multiple occasions, I have come up to the stables and have had to wait for other people to finish riding him. My last straw was when my dog died. I was extremely upset and I just wanted to go up and spend time with Sputnik. When I got there, I again, had to wait for other people to finish riding him. The next day I went up to the barn owner and told him I don‚Äôt want other people riding him outside of lessons and he agreed.

A few days after that, I had one of the girls come up to me and lectured me. Saying I was being ‚Äúselfish‚Äù and ‚Äújealous‚Äù and pointing out Sputnik isn‚Äôt actually mine. Her and the other girls are mad at me, my mother thinks I‚Äôm overreacting and the barn owner thinks I‚Äôm being reasonable. I‚Äôm not really sure what to think anymore.

4,1gaize0,WIBTA if i was brutally honest with my mother?,"My (28F) mother never treated my little brother (21M) and I the same. From a young age, I had to do chores around the house (cooking, cleaning, laundry, walking the dog...), any reports from school that mentioned me getting distracted or talking too much in class got me yelled at, if i didn't clean my room ""correctly"" or made a mess and didn't clean it properly i got called a filthy pig and she threatened to go to my school and tell everyone how much of a pig i was... things like that.

In contrast, my little brother always had someone cleaning up after him - often myself, under orders - and any irresponsible behaviour was always dismissed as ""oh, he's such a *boy*"" with a delighted chuckle. To this day, he still doesn't know how to do most chores. 

Don't get me wrong, I was never treated badly for being a girl otherwise. everything else, we got treated the same. it's just this one thing: i was always expected to be polite and responsible and take care of the house, and he was left to play games or go out with friends as he pleased, be impolite if he wanted, and any irresponsibility on his part was mostly ignored while mine was punished.

Anyway, I moved out long ago but my brother still lives with my mother. the issue is, when i visit for the day, my mother sometimes tells *me* to ""make him do X, he doesn't listen to me"". usually a chore of some kind.

he can never be trusted to do anything - you know those husbands who have to be told to do every single step of a chore or they stop halfway, or who need to be nagged for weeks to do something simple like take out the trash, because they keep ""forgetting""? that's my brother, 100%. and i'm not there anymore to do things, so my mother gets frustrated that my brother doesn't listen to her.

and i feel like, what, now *I* have to fix that too?

i am seriously considering, the next time she complains to me that ""he doesn't listen to her"", to tell her it's her own fault, for never making him suffer any consequences for irresponsibility growing up, and that while i get that she's frustrated with him, i'm not the person to vent to about it or to ask for help from on this issue.

but i might just be needlessly starting drama, because i know she will be upset. i also know she probably will not recognise/admit that what i am saying is true, so telling her this likely will only bother her in the moment but have no real effect on her behaviour in the long term, so i wouldn't even be getting anything out of this except for the brief rush of self-satisfaction. so, WIBTA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-23,"WIBTA if i was brutally honest with my mother?

5,1gaim2f,AITA for asking my sister to use her normal voice tone when she's talking with her boyfriend?,"I (F30) rent an apartment with my sister, Millie (F25). Millie is in a long-term relationship. Her partner lives abroad and while she visits him often (usually once per 1-2 months for at least a week), obviously they don't spend together as much time as they would want to. They plan to move in together, but it will take another 1-2 years to take care of all formalities.

Thus, Millie and her partner call each other on videochat and talk for few hours per day. Which itself is problematic - we have separate rooms but also very thin walls, so I hear her talking non stop. But I get it, she miss her boyfriend, so I don't comment on it and do my best to not to overhear too much.

But. Millie keeps using her Very Special Kind Of Voice when she's talking with her boyfriend.  You know, the very sweet, cutesy voice, where you misarticulate some words on purpose. She also uses a lot of nicknames like ""cootie-papootie"" or ""honeybear"" (well, their equivalents in my language, but you catch my drift). I don't know if she does it ironically or not and I don't really mind, as it's not my business - but from what I gather, she does *not* use it ironically, but really thinks that it's cute.

But it drives me crazy. Whenever I hear this very specific kind of voice it's like nails on a blackboard for me. And she uses it. Few. Hours. Per. Day. Every. Single. Day. I tried to ignore it, just like I ignore hours-long phone calls, but I cant - this kind of voice literally makes me very upset and physically unwell.

So, I asked her if she may please tone it down, or at least not use it all the time. I didn't demand it and tried to be pleasant - I tried to explain that it annoys me and I cannot concentrate on work (I work from home) or doing anything else when I keep hearing it.

I can use headphones, but I don't want to use them non stop for a few hours every day. And as we both earn low wages, it's impossible to soundproof the apartment.

She says that I'm a jealous asshole and I've no right to comment on the way she's speaking. Which, most of the time I'd agree with her, but then again - she talks like this every day for hours. Also, I'm *not* jealous of her relationship - I've my own partner with whom I'm pretty happy. So, I was pretty sure that I am in the right.

But when I talked about it with our mum and she says that I should leave Millie alone as ""she's not as sociable as me and we should be happy that she has someone to talk to"". Well, it *is* a fact that Millie is very socially anxious and for a long time she hadn't had any friends/partners except of me and my family - so maybe my mother is right and I should ignore this inconvenience for her mental health's sake?

7,1gai7cx,AITAH For Wanting My BF to ask his roommate to be civil?,"I, 29F, have been dating my boyfriend, 30M, for over a year. 

His roommate (30F) is his best friend of 3 years ( met on Tinder, hooked up but he decided they were better as friends. I had talks w/ each of them regarding them being completely over it. BF says he is not attracted to her & sees her as a sibling, & she said she was over it). 

They moved to my town about a month before we started dating. I met her soon after. We were friends for about 3/4 months before our first break being friends. She would tell me if anything I said didn‚Äôt match what he told her which made me question him a lot & us having many long conversations. one night after they had an argument & we were supposed to go out to an event all she did was tell everyone about their fight & how mad she was at him, she was also going through a rough time mentally after a breakup & cornered me into being her only support system, she would constantly talk about how all men she like rejected her including my BF & made us hangout less bc she didn‚Äôt want to be around couples, this lasted months. Background info from the start she said she‚Äôd never go on a trip w/ us together, only w/ him alone. She wakes up early & stays up late just to talk & see him in the morning & night. She was also upset when we first started seeing each other bc she said they were supposed to move together & stay single.
Later we became friends again but she continued her old habits. I explained to her multiple times that my relationship with him was my priority. She did not like that response, & I told her if she wasn‚Äôt okay with me talking to him about things they talked about then she shouldn‚Äôt tell me about their convos.I wanted to establishing this new boundary. She said she‚Äôd resent me if she couldn‚Äôt talk to me about him with me. I asked her if she thought us not being friends was the best option and we agreed to stop being friends.

This was 2 months ago. Since then she has banned me from the apartment & from their social events. My bf & I have been having sleepovers at my place 3 nights a week. He said that was fine but now complains that he isn‚Äôt home enough. When I ask him about when I‚Äôll be allowed over so we can spend more time together again, he just says she‚Äôs upset & doesn‚Äôt want me around. I even asked him to just ask her to be civil & allow me to spend time with him at his apartment but he just keeps saying she‚Äôs upset & won‚Äôt ask her to be civil with me. 

Since we stopped being friends, my BF & I‚Äôs relationship has been better aside from discussions regarding this. Even he has noticed how things are better now. They plan to renew their lease next summer bc he isn‚Äôt ready to live together yet & I‚Äôm worried about how this will affect our relationship moving forward. 

So I only get to go over to their apartment when she‚Äôs out of town & we‚Äôre going to be spending even less time together. I feel like I‚Äôm going to just keep getting pushed out of his life.

His roommate (30F) is his best friend of 3 years ( met on Tinder, hooked up but he decided they were better as friends. I had talks w/ each of them regarding them being completely over it. BF says he is not attracted to her & sees her as a sibling, & she said she was over it). 

They moved to my town about a month before we started dating. I met her soon after. We were friends for about 3/4 months before our first break being friends. She would tell me if anything I said didn‚Äôt match what he told her which made me question him a lot & us having many long conversations. one night after they had an argument & we were supposed to go out to an event all she did was tell everyone about their fight & how mad she was at him, she was also going through a rough time mentally after a breakup & cornered me into being her only support system, she would constantly talk about how all men she like rejected her including my BF & made us hangout less bc she didn‚Äôt want to be around couples, this lasted months. Background info from the start she said she‚Äôd never go on a trip w/ us together, only w/ him alone. She wakes up early & stays up late just to talk & see him in the morning & night. She was also upset when we first started seeing each other bc she said they were supposed to move together & stay single.
Later we became friends again but she continued her old habits. I explained to her multiple times that my relationship with him was my priority. She did not like that response, & I told her if she wasn‚Äôt okay with me talking to him about things they talked about then she shouldn‚Äôt tell me about their convos.I wanted to establishing this new boundary. She said she‚Äôd resent me if she couldn‚Äôt talk to me about him with me. I asked her if she thought us not being friends was the best option and we agreed to stop being friends.

This was 2 months ago. Since then she has banned me from the apartment & from their social events. My bf & I have been having sleepovers at my place 3 nights a week. He said that was fine but now complains that he isn‚Äôt home enough. When I ask him about when I‚Äôll be allowed over so we can spend more time together again, he just says she‚Äôs upset & doesn‚Äôt want me around. I even asked him to just ask her to be civil & allow me to spend time with him at his apartment but he just keeps saying she‚Äôs upset & won‚Äôt ask her to be civil with me. 

Since we stopped being friends, my BF & I‚Äôs relationship has been better aside from discussions regarding this. Even he has noticed how things are better now. They plan to renew their lease next summer bc he isn‚Äôt ready to live together yet & I‚Äôm worried about how this will affect our relationship moving forward. 

So I only get to go over to their apartment when she‚Äôs out of town & we‚Äôre going to be spending even less time together. I feel like I‚Äôm going to just keep getting pushed out of his life.

8,1gai632,AITA for telling my girlfriend she is being hypocritical?,"I 23M called my GF 21F while she was on her lunch break, she told me how a manager made her uncomfortable with joke about her parents ""keeping busy"". She has almost a dozen siblings, and she said it was offensive because that's their culture. I was dismissive at first, explaining that I don't think the manager intended to be offensive it was just in poor taste, but she was extremely adamant about her displeasure from the joke. Her reaction made me uncomfortable because is she has made comments about others cultures. Pakistani, Russian, Mexican, African Americans, etc, some of the comments she has made have been out of pocket jokes, and others just mild racism (although having used the hard R n-word could be considered more than mild). These comments did not bother me much because I always viewed her as someone who doesn't get offended, therefore doesn't understand her own offensiveness. 

I tried explaining how it was hypocritical for her to say her manager was being offensive without her looking at her own behavior. She got absolutely livid, saying it was not my place, she isn't racist on purpose, I am telling her how she can and cannot feel, she doesn't know what she can tell me anymore, and that all she needed was someone to listen to her not giving her a morality lesson.

I apologized for talking about this when she was at work, and I told her that I should have also said it in a nicer way. But that I am not sorry for my intended actions. In my eyes I was trying to do the right thing, and speak on an unhealthy mentality she has.

9,1gai3n7,WIBTA if I put in a notice to quit this childcare job?,"For the past 6 months, I (25F) have been the childcare provider for two weekly adults only book clubs (run by the same organization). 

The Monday night book club childcare situation is regularly 4-6 kids from ages 4-10. No problem there.

The Wednesday night book club childcare situation has been a bit in flux. For a couple weeks, there were no kids (some schedules changed with the start of the school year).

Last week, Susan (40s F) one of the members of both book clubs (but her kid only comes on Mondays) brought a friend to join the book club. Nicole (20s-30s?? F) brought her two kids, a 6 year old and a just under 1.5 year old toddler.

I do not have experience with toddlers, nor are the facilities optimized for toddlers (no playpens, etc). While she may not know my age group experience, Susan at the very least knew that all the Monday kids are at least 4 and she knew what the space looks like.

I watched Nicole‚Äôs kids and things went fine, but I was exhausted afterward. I feel like this is just not the job I signed up for. I have a chronic physical illness and fatigue is already a daily battle. It is part of the reason I will never have kids myself.

Would I be the asshole if I put in a notice? Is it shady if I try to keep the Monday night position, but ask them to find someone else for Wednesdays?

I think I could be the asshole here because I would be backing out of a job rather abruptly and I know finding a replacement will be a hassle for the organization. If this place had their crap together, I wouldn‚Äôt even consider that anyone would be the asshole - but because things are a mess, I know I will be vilified. I should also mentioned that my mother has been a member of both book clubs for about 10 months and would probably end up getting awkwardly wedged into doing childcare because she tends to have trouble saying no and Susan would probably ask her (even though Susan is not in charge). 

I should clarify that I absolutely do NOT think Nicole is the asshole here. She had no way of knowing what the facilities or usual age groups were like beyond whatever Susan told her, which doesn‚Äôt seem particularly well-informed. 

I think Susan MIGHT be the asshole here for not checking in about if there was any age cutoff and for likely misrepresenting how well equipped the childcare room is for a toddler. Like even if someone super comfortable with basically a baby was in charge, there‚Äôs still the issue of the space. But I also get that Susan is just trying to help out Nicole. (Childcare staff is paid by the org, it is free for book club participants). 

Also for a little context about my employment situation, I am grad student finishing up a thesis on an extension due to cardiac issues last semester. I am living back with my parents. I am not otherwise employed, but will be as soon as this thesis is done. But I am already exhausted and I cannot afford to take half the week to recover from having to be ‚Äúmommy‚Äù for two and a half hours.

In the 10 years we've been together, I can count on one hand the number of times l've met with his kids, usually for his birthday or a holiday.
In the past year, his son got married and there were several events surrounding the wedding. My partner initially stated that I was invited to the events but on the day of one of the smaller events, I was informed that I was not invited to the dinner because I'm not family.

Fast forward a few months later to Labor Day Weekend. My partner included me in a group text that he labeled, ""All Family."" The following is an excerpt from the group text. To add some context, the family owns a lake home that is shared by the family. They use a shared calendar to indicate when they will be using the house and his daughter selected the Labor Day weekend.

Daughter: No that's our immediate family. If you want to come up you are free to!

12,1gahqtq,AITA for calling my partner out on his smoking?,"So my (36f) partner (36m) of 11 years has been smoking cigarettes behind my back. We both quit 2 years ago, and he made a promise to me that he would never do it again. I know he's been smoking because I found an almost empty pack in the car. 

So while we were in the car, I confronted him, asking how long he'd been smoking behind my back. At first, he straight up lied to my face, saying he had not been. Then, when I made it clear that I found them, he said he had been going through a lot and he bought them last week. 

Thing is, I found them because I had been looking for them. I have suspected for awhile now that he had been smoking, longer than a week for sure, due to him smelling like cigarettes and ashes all over the car. He told me things like, ""Oh, you know, I work in a kitchen with smokers so I smell like it,"" and ""Oh, those ashes are from me smoking other things on break."" We do partake and he keeps a pipe in the car. 

Anyway, I told him to give me the pack and he did, and I got rid of them. He seemed pretty pissed after that. But I was upset about him lying to me and him not seeming even the least bit remorseful, so I told him it was immature and irresponsible to start smoking again after all this time and that him lying about it made it hard for me to trust him. 

He told me to shut up, that he didn't feel like dealing with it, and that I didn't have any empathy for what he's been going through.

I know it's a lot. I have cancer. The doctors have estimated 5 years that I have left on this planet. Treatment sucks a lot and has made work and chores impossible for me. He has had to do everything for me and the kids (we have 3 teenagers) and I do see how stressed out he has been because of it. He is also addicted to red bulls and doesn't really take care of himself (he never has, this isn't new since the cancer), and I told him if he keeps going like this our kids won't have any parents. 

He refuses to take responsibility for the smoking or the lying, making out like I'm the problem for calling him out. So am I? Was I too harsh? Am I lacking empathy?

For context, I've been in a friend group with my classmates (4 boys including me and 2 girls) who are also part of a larger friend group with people from other classes, and I've been close with one of them especially, we'll call him J. 

Backstory: 2 weeks prior to this main incident, me and J got into a fight. The reason for the fight was that he thought I talked back to the teacher. The teacher was changing our seating plan and she told me to sit somewhere else and pointed to another seat. I didn't see where she pointed and asked her where that was. He took that as me talking back to the teacher and almost raised his voice at me in class to just shut up and sit there. And then after that was recess, where he yelled at me and gave me an ultimatum. I was confused, but I knew I was in the right. Now, before he could make it right with me, he told not just the classmate friend group, he told the larger friend group. This was something that I hated to death. In my eyes, he made a me and him issue into an entire friend group issue. We could've settled it ourselves, he didn't have to tell everyone. Anyways,  he admitted he was at fault and we made amends.

Now, onto the main story. We were in math class, and the teacher called us to do the work, specifically me, J, and another boy in our friend group. I didn't have my calculator, but the other 2 did. I tried to help with what I could, but they were ignoring me. J used his calculator to answer, but got it wrong. The class laughed at him and i quietly mocked him. After another try, he got it right and we went back to our seats. J got pissed at me and said ""Where's your calculator, huh? You didn't do shit, dumbass bitch. shut the fuck up."" I had some issues outside of school that I was already fed up with, so in anger i threatened to throw something at him, in which he proceeded to call me ""the biggest pussy he's known in all his life"". The next class we had was the only class where the whole bigger friend group were with each other. I sat away from J who sat with all the others, and yet again he told everyone what happened instead of settling it with me. He even told them I have a mentality that I'm the only one that goes through shit, because I was going through shit and didn't want to be ridiculed by my own friends. He's also going through shit and if he's fine with being made fun of then that's fine.

14,1gah6e3,AITA for letting my kids live with me full time?,"I (40m) have been divorced from my ex wife (38f) for 10 years. We share two children ages 13 and 12. Per our court ordered custody order, once the children are 12 (or older) they have the right to say no to going to the other parents house and as long as we send that decision in written format (email, through the app or letter that has a copy) to the parent the children do not want to stay with anymore. I chose to use the co-parenting app to communicate our kids decision to stay with me.

My ex-wife hates the decision and has accused me of coming between our kids and her family and not promoting a healthy home life for our shared children. Of course she'd be upset and wouldn't like it. This is not the first she knew they felt this way. Last year she complained that the kids had asked to stay with me instead of going to her house. But she accused me of making the decision for them and letting them avoid their family.

Some bg to explain dynamics: Our divorce was not due to infidelity or any mistreatment. We were just not a good couple and we'd mostly married for the wrong reasons and tried staying together because she got pregnant twice. But it wasn't working. She remarried 8 years ago and has three additional children who are 5 and under. I brought our kids to meet their half siblings at the hospital or set up zoom calls for them to meet after birth (during Covid) because I had custody when my ex had her three other children. I was blamed for our kids lack of enthusiasm even though I did bring them and I even brought a small gift from our kids to their new sibling. My kids never liked ex's husband. He avoided me completely so I never spoke to him (and I did attempt to once or twice) but I also know ex's sister hates him and she and my ex no longer speak because of this. My kids and ex's relationship struggled since the birth of their first half sibling. They use half. She hates it. She punished them for using it and they said they weren't doing anything wrong which drove her crazy. She took me back to court and asked for full custody at the time because she believed it came from me. The judge dismissed her claims. But it didn't change how much the kids hated being there. I think the only reason our oldest didn't ask to stop a year ago is because of their sibling.

My ex has mentioned how all of this is my fault and if I had nipped the half in the bud and made them see they have two dads, none of this would be happening, she'd have the family she deserves. And she said that I am denying her younger kids the chance to know their siblings by letting our kids live with me.

Of course she'd be upset and wouldn't like it. This is not the first she knew they felt this way. Last year she complained that the kids had asked to stay with me instead of going to her house. But she accused me of making the decision for them and letting them avoid their family.

Some bg to explain dynamics: Our divorce was not due to infidelity or any mistreatment. We were just not a good couple and we'd mostly married for the wrong reasons and tried staying together because she got pregnant twice. But it wasn't working. She remarried 8 years ago and has three additional children who are 5 and under. I brought our kids to meet their half siblings at the hospital or set up zoom calls for them to meet after birth (during Covid) because I had custody when my ex had her three other children. I was blamed for our kids lack of enthusiasm even though I did bring them and I even brought a small gift from our kids to their new sibling. My kids never liked ex's husband. He avoided me completely so I never spoke to him (and I did attempt to once or twice) but I also know ex's sister hates him and she and my ex no longer speak because of this. My kids and ex's relationship struggled since the birth of their first half sibling. They use half. She hates it. She punished them for using it and they said they weren't doing anything wrong which drove her crazy. She took me back to court and asked for full custody at the time because she believed it came from me. The judge dismissed her claims. But it didn't change how much the kids hated being there. I think the only reason our oldest didn't ask to stop a year ago is because of their sibling.

My ex has mentioned how all of this is my fault and if I had nipped the half in the bud and made them see they have two dads, none of this would be happening, she'd have the family she deserves. And she said that I am denying her younger kids the chance to know their siblings by letting our kids live with me.

15,1gah3hp,AITA for telling people that my friend is going bald? ,"So this is a bit weird. And childish. But anyway. 

I (22M) have been living with my friend Jake (22M) as flatmates since college started, and we've become pretty close. He's been struggling with hair loss and goes to extreme lengths to hide it, and I've kept it private out of respect for him. No one else really knows. Or knew till like few days ago. 

Two weeks back,Jake finally got a dermatologist appointment and asked me to tag along. I was free so I was like why not? 

After the appointment, we swung by the pharmacy to pick up the prescribed Minoxidil. Sarah(20F), a girl from our college, happened to be shopping at the same pharmacy and saw the medication. 

Now the thing about Sarah is that she‚Äôs a big gossip and is very nosey. She can‚Äôt mind her own business and will make it a point to butt her ass in yours. And then she‚Äôll broadcast whatever dirt she finds for the entire college. I don‚Äôt really talk to her but Jake and her are kinda friends. 

Sometime later during college, Sarah asked Jake who the Minoxidil was for. Jake lied, saying it was for me. Sarah was apparently surprised , given my head full of hair, and to cover up Jake claimed I wear a hair patch.

Sarah wasted no time spreading the rumor around college, claiming I wore a wig. For two weeks, I got weird looks and jokes about windy days from classmates. Someone even came up to me, looked at my hair and went ‚Äòwow it looks so natural man‚Äô. 

I was confused and almost amused until Sarah asked me 4-5 days back if my ""treatment"" was working. I was like what treatment? 
That's when she told me what Jake had told her, and I put the pieces together.

I was annoyed and I said: ""Nah bro, Jake's the one going bald, not me.""

Sarah, predictably, shared this new info around college.

Now Jake's furious, saying he's really insecure about his hair loss and extremely upset that everyone knows his business. He claims he used my name because I don't have underlying insecurities and wouldn't be affected as much as he is. He said that as his friend, I should‚Äôve understood and just played along. He‚Äôs kinda depressed and refuses to talk to me anymore. 

I'm still annoyed he threw me under the bus.

She's religious, and I'm not. She doesn't force me to go to church, but she's one of those people that would definitely force me if she could. She's all sad because I don't Believe in God anymore, and want nothing to do with the religion, but I really don't care, because it's my life. I'm 21 years old, and I can have my own beliefs.

 Another thing to add onto this is that I'm blind, and getting my pictures taken has always been difficult for me, because I can't force my face into different expressions, because I never have learned how to. So chances are, when I'm there this afternoon, and we  get the  picture taken, i'm not going to be smiling, because I have no desire to even be there in the first place. 

My mother has already made it clear to me that I should smile for the picture, because she's always worried about what people will think.

17,1gagzav,AITA for paying rent for an ex? ,"My ex(33M) and I(31F) dated 5 years ago for 3 years. We adopted a dog together that he kept after we broke up. We broke up primary because I went from not wanting kids to kind of wanting kids in that time and he didn‚Äôt want kids and wanted me to be fully onboard with the child free thing but I wasn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm now trying for a child with my husband. 

The reason I feel obligated to help is because during the time I lived with my ex I paid no rent. He was working and I was getting my masters. Pretty much the entire relationship I was not making much and he was making a lot more to cover everything. Our rent was $1800 which he covered in full and it was an expensive rent for the city because we needed to live near the university. I paid my own groceries and half the utilities but that was it. He also took our dog because after our breakup I could not find a pet free apartment but I also could not afford rent on the apartment we lived in which allowed dogs. 

My husband and I got married a year ago and our finances are combined. We have our own spending money which I was planning on using to help my ex but he is against it because he believes ex‚Äôs should be cut off from all contact. To be clear I haven‚Äôt talked to any ex much and I only recently contacted my ex because we have mutual friends who told me about his situation. His company was absorbed by a bigger one and they laid off most of the employees. He only got 2 weeks severance and is now on EI but in our city EI is just a bit more than rent. He is thinking of moving back home to not have to pay rent but the dog we adopted together is dog reactive and his parents have dogs. She cannot live with another dog and gets into fights when we tried. She was 2 when we got her but already had behavior problems we got her and we never managed to correct it. We talked about me getting her but I have 2 dogs. 

I offered him $1000 for 3 months which should let him stay in the apartment and look for a job. He said he already has some interview processes ongoing and thinks that should be enough to cover and promised he would tell me if he got a job sooner and I could stop payment as soon as he got his paycheque.

It is from my personal account but I did tell my husband who was very upset and said I didn‚Äôt owe him anything. I explained how for nearly 3 years I didn‚Äôt pay rent and the situation with the dog that we adopted together but he said it was his problem and he didn‚Äôt argue I should pay rent back then so it‚Äôs too late.

I‚Äôm shocked because I haven‚Äôt contacted him at all and he was no reason to this I haven‚Äôt gotten over my ex.

So yesterday I (20F)was walking on the sidewalk and I saw this guy in the wheelchair trying to get on sidewalk. He seemed like he was stuck. We had a stare,  I thought he wanted help but was too shy to ask for it. 

I would help him myself but my hands were full with the bags. Plus I‚Äôm scrawny so I‚Äôm not sure if I could lift him even if I tried. Then i saw this bigger guy passing by, I tapped his shoulder and said ‚Äúcan you please help ? there‚Äôs a handicapped gentleman here and he‚Äôs stuck‚Äù 

I said part out loud and the guy in the wheelchair heard me. He said ‚Äúno I‚Äôm not‚Äú and got on the sidewalk by himself. 

I said ‚Äúsorry I thought you needed help. He said he doesn‚Äôt remember asking for any help  , then he said ‚Äúand handicapped , really ? It‚Äôs 2024.  ‚Äú 

I said ‚Äúso?‚Äù I genuinely didn‚Äôt understand what he was trying to get at. He must have thought I I was being shady or something because he got mad after hearing that. I don‚Äôt remember his exact phrasing but he said something like ‚Äúso you should drop the savior complex and whole you are at it, maybe try to be less ignorant‚Äù 

I thought he was being unnecessarily rude so I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm ignorant because I called you handicapped ? I was just trying to be nice. What else was  I supposed to say? Disabled , crippled ?‚Äù He laughed and said ‚Äúexcuse me‚Äù 

I was thinking to myself why the fuck is he laughing at. I thought he was being miserable and just trying to pick up a fight.  

I didn't wanna interact with him anymore , I told him maybe he should stop being a drama queen and left. He shouted ‚Äúasshole‚Äù as I was leaving. Am I really the asshole here? 

FYI : I‚Äôm not from the USA and I just moved here about a few months ago . You CAN clearly tell I‚Äôm foreigner by my accent.

20,1gagr4a,AITA for returning a gift to someone I was at one point romantically involved with to make my current girlfriend happy? ,"AITA for returning a gift from someone I used to date per the request of my now girlfriend who lives with me? 

So I've been an avid boxing fan and was a golden gloves fighter for years also. During the time I had a major crush on someone, she gave me a pair of Ali style old school lace up Everlast gloves for my birthday, knowing how much I enjoyed the sport. I had them on display in my house even after we had somewhat of a falling out because she claimed to not feel anything for me although we'd go on dates, have plenty of sex, even travel together.

For conciseness:  our uncle had a drug relapse. He is no contact with my sister and mum - their choice. I got him out of a sticky situation and, while upset, told my sister what happened to him. My bad. 

My sister calls our mum and tells her everything. I message my sister to say I do not appreciate the fact she told mum the story of our uncles relapse and the issues involved with getting him home (during the train journey he went missing and I had to call British Transport Police) when we were due to discuss it the next day together.

My sister replied saying ‚Äúleave me alone‚Äù, so I did. 

For context: my sister lives with chronic fatigue. She often is vile to people and cited CF as why. It‚Äôs hard to maintain a relationship with her, but I try and be as understanding as possible. She has bullied me our entire lives, asked ‚Äúwhy do you deserve that job?‚Äù when I have gotten a promotion - she is unemployed and has been for many years - and insulted any partner I have had (she has not had a date since her divorce ten years ago). She is derogatory to me regularly and always expects me to accept fault if we ever had a tiff, because in her eyes she can do no wrong. She is unable to see anybody else‚Äôs opinion, and she has been very unsupportive in my issues.

So, back to the story, I didn‚Äôt message my sister again. No big deal. My mum and sister always tell me I am a pushover and need to stand my ground more. So for once, I did. I didn‚Äôt message her. We were due to go to Paris for her 40th, but it collided with a bunch of medical appointments which were crucial for a sectioning referral I am currently going through. I messaged her to let her know‚Ä¶ no response. I messaged her on her birthday‚Ä¶ no response. I messaged our group chat (mum, sister and I) on the 10 year anniversary of our brother passing away - which she knew was a big deal - no response. My mum had posted several times in group chat - I respond - she doesn‚Äôt.

She also deleted me as a friend on DuoLingo, which we actively used together as a pair. Again, she is 40. 

SO

Now she‚Äôs told my mum ‚Äúmustardforest doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me‚Äù and is playing victim, again. My mum is calling me every day telling me to message my sister. I explained that I have done nothing wrong, and as an adult she should be able to receive a message saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate X‚Äù without throwing a huge tantrum. It didn‚Äôt need to be an issue. I wasn‚Äôt angry, I wasn‚Äôt aggressive. 

My mum told her what has happening health wise with me - I‚Äôm waiting on a sectioning agreement as my BMI is too low and am borderline organ failure. This is not something I am proud of, and was not my intention. My sister still didn‚Äôt message me, but told my mum that it‚Äôs on me to apologise.

We were due to go to Paris for her 40th, but it collided with a bunch of medical appointments which were crucial for a sectioning referral I am currently going through. I messaged her to let her know‚Ä¶ no response. I messaged her on her birthday‚Ä¶ no response. I messaged our group chat (mum, sister and I) on the 10 year anniversary of our brother passing away - which she knew was a big deal - no response. My mum had posted several times in group chat - I respond - she doesn‚Äôt.

She also deleted me as a friend on DuoLingo, which we actively used together as a pair. Again, she is 40. 

SO

Now she‚Äôs told my mum ‚Äúmustardforest doesn‚Äôt want to talk to me‚Äù and is playing victim, again. My mum is calling me every day telling me to message my sister. I explained that I have done nothing wrong, and as an adult she should be able to receive a message saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt appreciate X‚Äù without throwing a huge tantrum. It didn‚Äôt need to be an issue. I wasn‚Äôt angry, I wasn‚Äôt aggressive. 

My mum told her what has happening health wise with me - I‚Äôm waiting on a sectioning agreement as my BMI is too low and am borderline organ failure. This is not something I am proud of, and was not my intention. My sister still didn‚Äôt message me, but told my mum that it‚Äôs on me to apologise.

So, please help, AITA for finally standing my ground with my sister?",0.0,-0.0139082772657275,0,1
28,1gaept7,AITA for scolding(?) my friend?,"We were having a class together where we had to create a story based off a script that was given to us and go around the campus to take photos that shows what you want the story to look like if it was a short film (basically photo sequencing or storyboarding). It was a team assignment and at first i was happy because I was grouped with my friend and im super introverted so i was glad to have someone im close to in the class. 

Now keep in mind that it was the second lesson for that semester so me and my group mates still had that stranger danger kind of vibe but we still managed to get along well. However when the project started, she was on her phone from the time the class started and throughout the entire thing. So at first i dismissed it thinking maybe she's just tired simce it was an 8am class.

So i suggested if she wants to follow me and one other guy (let's call him M) to go around and take pictures for the story + freshen up a little by going out of the classroom. But as we were walking around, only me and M was actively contributing and giving ideas for the story while she just stood and listened with a disinterested face or just texted on her phone repeatedly. 

Even during lunch i had to repeat my words twice just to catch her attention and she still doesn't hear what i have to say which made me feel kind of invalidated tbh (we're in the trio friendship kind if situation yk but i didn't really think abt that much bc i already expected it and they get along better together than i do with them). And it went on like this for the entire day even until the end of class, but my group decided to stay back to finish the work so we don't have to stress about it the next day.

And just then we were briefed on our end-year assignment where we can pair up with friends to work on it together. But i was hesitant to work with her even though she's my friend because in my mind i was scared, like- what if she acts like that while we are doing the project?? I don't want to carry the grouo work and do everything myself and I don't want my gpa to be pulled down and i don't want hers to drop either even though she claims to not care about her gpa. Bc if she fails this module she wld have to pay to remod and she's already having financial struggles especially with school fees and stuff.

And i was also kind of irritated so i admit the way i spoke to her may have been a bit harsher than i had meant for it to sound but still, aita? Or am i just being too much and i shouldn't be so up in her space and keeo my distance instead?

29,1gaenvh,"AITAH for telling my dad to leave me alone and never contact me again, or am I just overreacting?","For context, I come from a family that is for the most broke and with alot of issues. I don't exactly have the best relationship with my dad or some other people in my family. 

I (F15) recently went through a tough time with my sisters because we were suddenly told that my dad put the house up for sale and that my father and stepmother were breaking up with each other (they were engaged with each other since 2018 if I can remember). Everything seemed fine with me attending my old school until the last day I was there.

It wasn't until 2 weeks after that they announced the random house sale and breakup that I finally found out what had truly happened between the two and why the house was being put up for sale. 

Of what my sister explained to me, my dad apparently ran out of money and needed to sell the house because he had an upcoming surgery on his leg. But the thing is, he keeps switching up the story about how he wasnt getting the surgery and that he initially was selling the house because he ran out of money, was broke, and couldn't afford to pay the bills anymore. This didn't surprise me though because he always did something similar to this to get money. He would create some sort of sob story about how he couldn't walk or was tired, or that he had just even came out of the hospital, which obviously wasn't true. 

Another thing I had learned was that he was having an affair with a woman named Jessica behind my stepmoms back, claiming it was 'love at first sight'. This truly broke the last straw I had with him about the situation. He had through away a 11 year relationship with someone who took care of him whenever he needed something to eat, whenever he fell out of bed or had seizures, or needed money. Yes, he did steal money from her. Not only that, he had also gotten promise rings with this Jessica woman. 

He also was getting child support money from my mother, along with a card that had money on it for him to spend on me and my brother since my sisters are 19 and 20. But did he? No. He spent it only on himself to buy action figures, food for himself, or other things he didn't need that he would later on just resell. Another time was when I was younger, my dead excuse of a grandmother got me and my brother into a car accident which resulted in me cracking my forehead open. The court had issued me a bank account with a few thousand dollars in it that I couldn't access until I turned 18. The thing is, my dad at the time had legal guardianship over it. My mom noticed that my dad had done something with the account and that the money had gone missing. To this day they don't know where it went or what he did with it. The only thing I can guess is that he bought things for himself even though the money rightfully belonged to me.

I'm doing a little bit better now though because thankfully my mother took me and my brother in.

34,1gadeh0,AITA for distancing myself from a friend who constantly starts arguments and plays the victim?,"
Hello, I‚Äôm making this post not to get everyone on my side or prove my point, but because I‚Äôm genuinely questioning whether I am the bad person in this situation.

I‚Äôve been friends with this person for about two years since we started high school (we‚Äôre in the same class), and we immediately became good friends. However, there are things that bother not just me but almost everyone in my class‚Äînamely, her angry outbursts over situations she created herself and then making herself out to be the victim. For example, just a few weeks ago, she got into an argument with another classmate and swore at him about his mother (something she conveniently left out when she told me about the incident, twisting the story instead). Rather than apologizing later, she started to cry and ended up being sent to the principal‚Äôs office along with the same guy. I wasn‚Äôt in school that day, but the guy and several other classmates confirmed the same story.

Along with frequently playing the victim, she seems to enjoy arguing, especially with me, and often over pointless things. There have been multiple times that I‚Äôve had to ‚Äúargue‚Äù with her over text for hours because she simply wouldn‚Äôt get my point. During these arguments, I‚Äôve always tried to de-escalate the situation, but each time she ignored my attempts and continued to argue, even when I left her messages on read.

Our latest argument was because I didn‚Äôt care that one of the freshmen at our school changed into different clothes in the bathroom. Because of my indifference, she accused me of having no feelings and only caring about myself. I don‚Äôt understand why I should care about what someone I don‚Äôt even know is doing (and she doesn‚Äôt know them either). That argument was my breaking point, so I finally texted our friend group about it, and we all agreed that the problem clearly lies with her.

To add to that, after the argument ended, she sent Snapchats of herself crying to all four of us in the friend group. All I had said to her was that it‚Äôs simply not my concern what that person does because I don‚Äôt know them. Fast forward a few days, she tells me a guy messaged her about volunteering at the same place where I volunteer. I was the one who originally encouraged her to apply when we were still friends, so I was a bit annoyed but didn‚Äôt say anything. After school, she asked if I had a problem with her volunteering, and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt really want to volunteer with her anymore. She instantly got mad, but I couldn‚Äôt tell her the reasons because I knew she would have a huge reaction and ignore everything I had to say.

In the end, she told me to message the guy that she wouldn‚Äôt be volunteering, but I didn‚Äôt do it. The next day, I noticed she was on her phone a lot, messaging people. I was shocked when I saw her texting a friend, trying to get her to volunteer with her. I stayed quiet until our break, when I pulled my friend aside and told her what I saw. It turns out she had texted the guy at the volunteer place, telling him I didn‚Äôt want her to volunteer. This wasn‚Äôt just a simple message; they were sending long paragraphs to each other. This made me extremely mad because she went behind my back instead of just telling me she was going to volunteer anyway (if she had, I would have sucked it up and not made a big deal out of it).

So, I decided to message the guy myself, explaining in detail why I didn‚Äôt want her volunteering with me. He understood the situation and assured me he wouldn‚Äôt say anything to her. I‚Äôm not sure what he‚Äôll tell her if she follows up, but we‚Äôll deal with that when the time comes.

A few days later, she started an argument with another friend in our group. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly happened, but I know my friend stopped responding to her messages altogether.

We haven‚Äôt spoken for a few days now, but I know she‚Äôs been talking about us to someone else over text. She‚Äôs also been reposting sad videos on TikTok, and I can‚Äôt help but feel bad and guilty. I know I was wrong to talk about her (or the situation) behind her back with our friend group, but I don‚Äôt understand‚Äîare we in the wrong for cutting her off?

We had even planned to talk to her as a group to discuss what behaviors we all could work on, but she declined and started an unnecessary argument instead.

Rather than apologizing later, she started to cry and ended up being sent to the principal‚Äôs office along with the same guy. I wasn‚Äôt in school that day, but the guy and several other classmates confirmed the same story.

Along with frequently playing the victim, she seems to enjoy arguing, especially with me, and often over pointless things. There have been multiple times that I‚Äôve had to ‚Äúargue‚Äù with her over text for hours because she simply wouldn‚Äôt get my point. During these arguments, I‚Äôve always tried to de-escalate the situation, but each time she ignored my attempts and continued to argue, even when I left her messages on read.

Our latest argument was because I didn‚Äôt care that one of the freshmen at our school changed into different clothes in the bathroom. Because of my indifference, she accused me of having no feelings and only caring about myself. I don‚Äôt understand why I should care about what someone I don‚Äôt even know is doing (and she doesn‚Äôt know them either). That argument was my breaking point, so I finally texted our friend group about it, and we all agreed that the problem clearly lies with her.

To add to that, after the argument ended, she sent Snapchats of herself crying to all four of us in the friend group. All I had said to her was that it‚Äôs simply not my concern what that person does because I don‚Äôt know them. Fast forward a few days, she tells me a guy messaged her about volunteering at the same place where I volunteer. I was the one who originally encouraged her to apply when we were still friends, so I was a bit annoyed but didn‚Äôt say anything. After school, she asked if I had a problem with her volunteering, and I told her that I wouldn‚Äôt really want to volunteer with her anymore. She instantly got mad, but I couldn‚Äôt tell her the reasons because I knew she would have a huge reaction and ignore everything I had to say.

In the end, she told me to message the guy that she wouldn‚Äôt be volunteering, but I didn‚Äôt do it. The next day, I noticed she was on her phone a lot, messaging people. I was shocked when I saw her texting a friend, trying to get her to volunteer with her. I stayed quiet until our break, when I pulled my friend aside and told her what I saw. It turns out she had texted the guy at the volunteer place, telling him I didn‚Äôt want her to volunteer. This wasn‚Äôt just a simple message; they were sending long paragraphs to each other. This made me extremely mad because she went behind my back instead of just telling me she was going to volunteer anyway (if she had, I would have sucked it up and not made a big deal out of it).

So, I decided to message the guy myself, explaining in detail why I didn‚Äôt want her volunteering with me. He understood the situation and assured me he wouldn‚Äôt say anything to her. I‚Äôm not sure what he‚Äôll tell her if she follows up, but we‚Äôll deal with that when the time comes.

A few days later, she started an argument with another friend in our group. I‚Äôm not sure what exactly happened, but I know my friend stopped responding to her messages altogether.

We haven‚Äôt spoken for a few days now, but I know she‚Äôs been talking about us to someone else over text. She‚Äôs also been reposting sad videos on TikTok, and I can‚Äôt help but feel bad and guilty. I know I was wrong to talk about her (or the situation) behind her back with our friend group, but I don‚Äôt understand‚Äîare we in the wrong for cutting her off?

We had even planned to talk to her as a group to discuss what behaviors we all could work on, but she declined and started an unnecessary argument instead.

35,1gadajv,AITA for calling my sick brother a freak?," little brother (14) was born with a disease, he's had heart problems and lung problems since he was born, because of this, as a kid I barely saw my parents. We travelled for medical reasons, but they were always in the hospital. I was neglected during their travels

This happened in April, but yesterday was my brothers birthday.

My brother has issues with communicating his feelings, so he bottles them up, he thinks he's worried us enough, and doesn't talk about his problems unless asked directly, but sometimes this bottling up causes him to say complete bullshit that makes me furious. I usually never react, I either tell him to be respectful, or I just laugh it off.

In April, my brother and I got into a huge argument, it was so stupid I don't even remember what about. I was just so angry, and I was yelling and told him to get the fuck out of my room. He wouldn't listen. We were both yelling at each other. He ended up calling me some names, and I yelled ""At least I'm not a fucking freak! Look at yourself!""

My brother is self-conscious, he's 14 but he looks 8, because of the being sick, he doesn't gain weight in some places, but he's been learning to accept it.

His face dropped. I don't think I'll ever forget the look on his face. He started screaming, and he was crying and he kept screaming at me. I ended up locking the door to my room, and I cried for hours because I knew I should have said that.

The next day, I woke up and no one was home. My older brother was in the military, so it wasn't strange, but no one else was home.

I called my mom, and she told me they were in the hospital, but she wouldn't explain. I got there and saw my family. My dad was standing out the door and he looked terrified.

My mom wouldn't stop crying, and I couldn't understand what the doctors were saying. My brother barely survived, he was in the ICU for a few weeks.

When I saw him in there, he was praying. He was mentioning how he wanted to go to heaven peacefully, and he said it like he thought he was dying. He was on a lot of medication. I couldn't stop crying. I kept thinking ""thats my baby brother. I said that to my baby brother."" I do not remember much of what happened, I think my mind sort of erased it all. My uncle was there, he told me I was crying so much and I was just whispering ""I'm so sorry. I love you. Please forgive me."" over and over.

I visited him, but he wouldn't speak to me, but he was also still on medication. Whenever I would try and talk to him, he would ignore me. I was at home taking care of my 5 year old sister, so I couldn't visit much, and my big brother is in military.

I apologised again when he came back home, and he forgave me. He smiled and held my hand.

Yesterday, I got him a cake with his face on it, and I said ""my beautiful brother."" when I showed him the cake, and he looked so sad, and I knew he remembered what I had said.

36,1gad6cl,AITA for wasting everyone's time in therapy because I was accused of lying?,"My mom, her husband and I (16f) are in group therapy with each other. We started therapy a few weeks after Father's Day, because that was the final straw for them to insist we all needed therapy to work on why I won't let us be the family they want. We started at the end of July and by the end of August my mom accused me of lying, called me a liar and laid out this really big sob story about how much it hurt to have me lie to her and do everything in my power to destroy her marriage.

It pissed me off so bad. I didn't lie at any point of this. I said as much in the follow up session and the therapist asked me to outline my side and how I felt having mom call me a liar. My mom kept trying to interrupt me, she told the therapist the shut up and she accused me of being a vicious liar then.

To give some explanation about the situation. My mom and her husband got married 3 years ago. They moved in together 2 months before. Before moving in they sat me down and asked me if I was okay with us moving in together and making a family of three again. Mom brought up how we'd have a man around the house again (my dad died) and how good it would be for her to have a husband and for me to have a dad and he said he couldn't wait to be my dad and he always wanted to be a dad. He said he already had plans for us for Father's Day. This was February of three years ago. I told them I wasn't okay with that stuff. That I didn't want another dad, wouldn't let him be my dad, and was not about to spend Father's Day celebrating someone who isn't dad. They started laughing and proceeded as normal but Father's Day became a struggle because I have not spent the day with him the last three years and he has tried, so has my mom. I meant what I said. I never called him dad or let him fill the role in my life. This year he snapped and he had a temper tantrum and said I was supposed to be with him on Father's Day and not spending the day alone and he didn't sign up to be nothing to me.

My mom called me a liar because she said I promised to develop a close relationship with her husband and that I said yes to wanting what they asked. She said I had said I would give him Father's Day and I lied and I have not followed through on any of it. She said I made them think I would be a willing participant and I wanted us to be a family. It pisses me off because I never said what she claims and I even repeated what I had said back then. 

The therapist couldn't get mom to apologize and she has no control over the sessions where my mom and her husband dominate. So I'm totally silent and I zone out. They only realized this two weeks ago. They called me on it and I spoke up again after more than a month of no talking in therapy, to confirm I wasn't listening and it came up last week and I said I was done engaging because I was owed an apology for being called a liar. My mom and her husband are pissed that I'm wasting everyone's time letting therapy happen.

Needed a third perspective, because at the moment all I think is that the ask is unreasonable, how am I supposed to tell knowledge that should be known already? It isn‚Äôt my fault she was lied to, yet I‚Äôm the one being accused of hiding things.

Apparently I should‚Äôve said this months ago, not leaving out details and being 100% transparent. I never knew her ex mate had told her that it was a one-sided thing, with me being the one to break the news to her. I wasn‚Äôt privy to this information, and I didn‚Äôt know my girlfriend was under the assumption it was one-sided too, I thought it was natural to assume people in a ‚Äútalking‚Äù stage would flirt.

Needed a third perspective, because at the moment all I think is that the ask is unreasonable, how am I supposed to tell knowledge that should be known already? It isn‚Äôt my fault she was lied to, yet I‚Äôm the one being accused of hiding things.

will almost definitely delete in a bit, just thought I‚Äôd rant and hear if I‚Äôm being unreasonable

For context, I'm a female college student. My school is four hours away from my house and literally different province/island.

So last night, I found out that my parents allowed  my cousin, a guy, to sleep in my room. Note that, I have never been home ever since class started, so thats about 3 months.
I still have my personal things such as my books, clothes, and underwear left in my room. I am not judging my cousin or anything..

He has been staying there for almost a month, and nobody told me. They didn't asked my permission.

When I confronted them, they got mad. And questioned, why is it such a big deal. 

My cousin is a heavy smoker and honestly if you have ever been in a man's room the smell (not the cologne but his actual scent) is different and sticks to literally everything (clothing, sheets, etc) you will understand were I'm coming from.

I feel so upset and honestly I don't want to go home. I'm already so tired because I still have exams coming up and now this... 

My father keeps insisting that it's not big deal and is calling me selfish, while my other family members keeps insisting that I should just let it be because he's a family...

A couple of years ago, my wife's brother passed away and at the time and since, my best friend, who was also my best man at my wedding, hasn't said a word to her in any capacity to acknowledge her loss. I've always known she was was disappointed in him for that but a couple of weeks ago we were invited to his wedding, with me as his best man. My wife has said she doesn't want to go because of how disappointed she is with him. I politely relayed this to him straight away, explaining she may not want to come because of how he made her feel. He replied to say he didn't say anything as he didn't want to tread on her toes and just wanted to let her grieve. I passed this on to my wife who said she wants him to talk to her directly. It's now a further two times I've let my best friend know that she'd like him to message her directly to try and explain things and not go via me. Long story short, he refuses to because he feels he has done nothing wrong and he doesn't want to pander to her as he feels she is being petty and should just be able to move on without the need to talk to her directly. 

Ultimately, I am just passing info between them both -, she wants him to talk to her, he flat-out refuses. I am not going to keep asking him as he knows the score and he will not change his stance. 

The issue I now have is that my wife has now said off the back of his last response to me that she doesn't want to go to his wedding, and I am also a bad person in her eyes for not telling him I will also not attend the wedding in order to stand by her. AITA in some way in any of this, or am I just trying to maintain balance between the two? I feel it's the latter. As a side point to this, should I be telling my best friend that because my wife doesn't want to go, I can't go either and be done with it? It's a very tricky situation to be in I think.

At first I (17F) didn't really have a problem with him, we walked the same way to the train station in the morning and sometimes we talked. My mom did make me cover up alot more. Overall we were fine at first but around August, he asked if puppy could stay with us for bit to give his mom who watching her a break. I was against it because my dog, Clara, doesn't like other dogs and puppies are so much work but my mom is the boss and she said yes. 

The puppy was 5 months old and constantly shits and pisses everywhere. He never cleans up after it and it has chewed up my mom's belonging and furniture. At some point she even told me she wanted to get rid of my dog so the puppy could have more room. I never complained though, I tolerated it, thinking eventually the puppy would have to go home. Well it's October and the puppy is still here shitting and pissing everywhere.

 To make things worse the boyfriend has been nothing but an asshole to mom. He constantly leaves to go with other women and when my mom asks he just says ""I don't want to bothered"".

He's the only boy in a family full of girls so he's spoiled rotten and doesn't really know how to take care of a house My mom explained to me that she ignores everything to avoid conflict and tension and she advised me to do the same.

Today, I couldn't take it, this morning I woke up late and had to walk both dogs so I was already irritated but my favorite jacket got wet.

He said ""why didn't you put these clothes up, all you do is lay around, you need to get up and do something"".

 I was so mad, I tried to just leave to I could calm down but he stopped me and asked if I knew where the keys were. I knew I shouldn't have done it but I said ""I never have the keys"" and made a irritated face. He asked why I made that face, and I madly replied ""what face?"" without thinking.

I (23F) recently moved into a new apartment about 20 minutes away from my parents' place. Only my family and best friend know my address‚Äîmost of my other friends, including ""B"" (26F), only know the town.

B has been upset that I haven't shared my new address with her. My reasons are the following:

1. The place isn't fully set up yet, with boxes everywhere, pictures still not hung up, and half-built furniture. I don't feel comfortable having guests over yet.
2. I‚Äôve been hesitant to give B my address because she often shows up unannounced, even if I say I‚Äôm busy. She‚Äôs been doing this for almost two years, disregarding my plans and getting upset if she doesn‚Äôt get my full attention. Despite many conversations and attempts to set boundaries, she continues to show up and act like we never talked about it.

I explained my reasons to her, promising that once I'm settled, I'll invite everyone over. In the meantime, I still see B regularly‚Äîabout twice a week for dinners, lunches, and group hangouts. However, she insists this isn't enough and says I should see her 3-4 times a week, and it doesn‚Äôt count if it isn‚Äôt just the two of us. Last weekend, she brought this up in front of our friends, but they surprisingly agreed with me that she should respect my boundaries. I thought the issue was resolved, but then today happened.

Today, on my day off, I planned to catch up on chores, do some writing, and meet B in the evening to go to the gym and grab dinner. While making lunch, my doorbell rang, but I ignored it, thinking it was just someone from the local church again. Then there was a knock on my door, so I checked, and it was B. She explained, with a big grin, that she had been driving around town trying to find my car and, after spotting it, rang all the doorbells nearby until she found me. When I didn‚Äôt let her in, she convinced a neighbor to let her up.

At this point, I kinda snapped. I felt incredibly violated and told her she was crazy with nothing better to do, that she shouldn‚Äôt come by anymore, and canceled our plans for later. She refused to leave, insisting I was overreacting and should be flattered she wanted to see me so badly. I ended up physically pushing her out and closing the door.

I was furious as I had spent my money to bring back a part of me I was insecure about. Upon yelling at her she just rolled her eyes and told me that she needed it more than I did. I was horrified.

I screamed more and after she got mad at me for screaming she yelled at me and threw it in the toilet flushing it away. And since it was a small thin bottle it went down right away. 

I stood in shock as she had done what she did, and she left the bathroom like it was nothing going off to get into my car. After a bit of ugly crying I went to my car to get ready for school to find my sister in my car. I was still super upset so I told her she can ride the bus from now on, and I would no longer be driving her.

My dad always had a job that took him away from home for days or sometimes weeks at a time. Because of this, the custody schedule my parents have for me isn't a traditional one but is dependent on my dad being home. If he's not in town I don't go to his house. If he is I go for a few days or a week depending on how long he's home for. My dad's wife has argued in the past that I should be allowed to spend dad's time at the house with her if dad isn't around but mom and the courts disagree.

This has meant they don't get along and my mom and dad's wife hate each other and my dad resents mom for upsetting his wife. He's really rude to her when they have to talk, even in front of me. Mom stays civil but cool. My dad's wife is just really bitchy to mom if she says anything to or about her.

Things only got worse when my half siblings came along and my mom wouldn't agree to send me over if dad wasn't around. She did ask me if I wanted to go over more, but I didn't. She never told them that so they still blame her.

My dad left a week ago and he'll be gone for another three weeks. His wife was struggling with my half siblings because she was sick, some of them were sick and one of my half siblings has ADHD and wasn't sick so was going stir crazy. She asked me to come over to help out and I didn't. She asked me two more times and I still didn't go. My dad called Sunday night and asked why I didn't go and at least help out for 10 or 15 minutes. I told him I didn't want to. My grandparents don't like dad's wife so they refused to help her out either and her family isn't close to her. Dad told me to just do it but I didn't and then Monday dad told me I was being a brat and things were falling apart there and I should be ashamed for being unwilling to do anything to help my family and he lectured me on how they're family and it's not fair that I don't treat them like family, because if I did I would help.

54,1ga9akb,AITA for expecting my girlfriend to sometimes be a little more available during work?,"Me (27M) and my girlfriend (25F) both work from home. I work as a programmer and she works as an incident manager. We work at different companies, both have work from 11 AM to 7PM. Now my job is to do my tasks within a given deadline and that's about it. I have some meetings sometimes but they are mostly with my colleagues and rarely with management. In both cases I take a more easygoing approach to it and it seems my colleagues/managers do the same.  
Now, my girlfriend also has meetings with her colleagues/managers but also with the customers. Now, don't get me wrong, when she's in a meeting with a customer I never bother her in any way. I understand that she needs to be completely focused because that's what her actual work is about.  
But when she is in meetings with her colleagues, with which she talks like normal people, they talk about work itself, they talk about random stuff, they crack jokes, etc., no matter what, she is almost always completely dead focused and when I try to get her attention for one second she basically just makes a ""shoving"" action with her hand or just tells me ""can't right now"".  
Now I understand the stuff I usually bother her with are very small things, like I found a funny picture, or I want her to pass me something that is on her desk instead of me going to take it. I know it's mostly just small stuff which I can do myself or it can wait.  
But on the other hand, I don't know if either I'm the one who's taking work too carefree, or if she's the one who's taking it too seriously. She believes that ""work is work"" and there's no ifs and buts about it, I believe that even if it is ""work"", it's still done by humans, and by communication and understanding is how we got here in the first place.

Until right before departure, I was in my little cabin alone when a man (older, probably 50sM?) Asked if he could sit. There were other, fully empty cabins.

Due to all of these things, I kept myself as far away as physically possible, which was not very far, started mouth breathing, and put a mask on.

I didn't say anything to the man or make a face or draw attention to it, but the action was obvious because we weren't approaching a stop and we were the only two people in the cabin. As I was opening the door, the man flipped me off and gave me a kind of sneer. I didn't respond at all, and I don't feel like I was wrong. It seems likely he was just unaware so I looked like a jerk or was aware and self-conscious and I made it worse, but still...AITA for non-verbally making it pretty clear that I was leaving the cabin because of his nauseating (and I am not saying that lightly) odor?",0.0,0.054686103016138,0,1

At this point I think he just likes being jobless so he can complain.

My mother, a hardworking and loving mother, who was all I had growing up has changed lately. She's gone from my best friend to my friend that only hangs out with me to get something in return. l'm still only 16 but i have already graduated high-school and am trying to go to college, and this is her reason for why she doesn't think I should go. I should also mention that I wanted to take a year to save up and be really ready but she was the one who suggested and got me all excited about going once l'm 17 in June or July. Now- I have been doing our family laundry for the past three days because my mother recently had blood clots in her feet so she has a hard time with stairs(she has been sleeping in the living
room). Last night it reached 2am and I was too tired plus my stepfather was working a night shift so I fell asleep in her room. I woke up to her yelling at me, for the dirty laundry room and HER dirty room, in which I had touched nothing except her bed, which I even made for her. My stepfather had kept their room and the laundry room, FILTHY. She yelled at me for not thinking to clean it all up and then at 5 in the morning she proceeded to make me get up out of my sleep, pickup, and then move to my room where she yelled at me some more and then told me I will never make it on my own or leave this house if I'm gonna be like this and then proceeded to tell me that when she gets back she expects me to have cleaned the
WHOLE house by myself (A finished basement as well). I don't even think It's her fault either as she's been through hell, that's the hard part. It feels hard being mad at her because she's a loving mother, teacher, and when my
dad was never there for us she was-but I feel as though she has a type with these men, and that they almost manipulate her into being like this even though they do jack-squat around the house, yet they have no problem sleeping all day and being A-Holes.

A little backstory: our dad passed away three years ago, and when we were kids, he used to take us to our local zoo. It was one of my favorite things to do as a family.

So, recently, I asked my sister and her husband if they‚Äôd like to go. They have a 14-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old son. Since we‚Äôve never gone to the zoo as a family, I thought it might be something they‚Äôd enjoy. A few weeks ago, they said, ‚ÄúSure, let‚Äôs plan it.‚Äù

This week, I called my mom to let her know we need to do it soon since I‚Äôll be starting school in about 2-3 weeks. This was her response:

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way your brother-in-law will drive that far to the zoo. He works all week and does overtime. Why are you pushing this?‚Äù

I replied, ‚ÄúThey said sure, let‚Äôs plan it‚Ä¶ and Mom, everyone works hard. We‚Äôre all tired on the weekends.‚Äù

She responded, ‚ÄúYeah, but he doesn‚Äôt have time for this. It‚Äôs good enough to see each other on the weekends. I feel bad for him; he sacrifices his Saturdays to come over for family dinners at your sister‚Äôs place.‚Äù

(We gather every Saturday or Sunday for dinner at my mom‚Äôs house.)

I said, ‚ÄúMom, we haven‚Äôt gone on a vacation since Dad passed away. I think it would be nice to go.‚Äù

She cut me off and said, ‚ÄúThe kids don‚Äôt care about the zoo. They have their own interests. They just want to be on their phones and play video games.‚Äù

I got a bit cheeky and said, ‚ÄúGreat, let‚Äôs raise a bunch of zombie cellphone-addicted kids who never go outside.‚Äù

She flared up and yelled, ‚ÄúYOUR SISTER TAKES THEM TO ACTIVITIES ALL WEEK LONG‚ÄîMUSIC CLASS, SWIMMING, BASKETBALL PRACTICE, BLAH BLAH BLAH.‚Äù

Im 19F and my friend is 20M, we often play games together or just chat after work but this is making me seriously reconsider who I am friends with. I have level 1 autism so please go easy on me if Im not undersfanding an obvious social clue.

Yesterday evening we decided to play Baldurs Gate 3 together, something we have been doing regularly most evenings and he asked if a friend of his can join the call since they are lonely and wanted to talk to him while we play (The friend is 19NB). I reluctantly agreed even being extremely insecure about my voice which I dont use to talk to most people, but I suppose I was having a good day so I agreed. We continued playing the game and he added the person to the call on discord, it was very awkward at first but then we both kind of opened up and started getting comfortable talking to eachother. After a bit of talking I decided to send them a discord friend request since they seemed nice and a good person to be around so they accepted it. Later in the call something came up and I responded ""Oh were already friends on discord youre gonna get bullied by the both of us at the same time more often now"" (This is something I know he is okay with and i know isnt a problem, I made sure to know that before doing it, we bully eachother in a friendly way all the time).

I talked to friend 2 about it (The 19 NB one) and they said that they dont really know what happened either, and after a bit i find out from them that he told them to not contact me anymore and that is the last time I have heard from them. I sent him a friend request back because i saw he accepted it but then he refused to answer to me until today morning.

He said that he is uncomfortable with friend 2 being friends with me because of something that happened in his past, he doesnt care if they have other friends just not ones that he knows (This is the part that doesnt really make sense to me). This prompted a pretty big argument between me and him with me calling it unreasonable and manipultive to do this. He is saying that he is uncomfortable with them meeting a friend of his but not when he meets a friend of theirs. I also just found out they are in an ""Unofficial relationship"". I cannot seem to understand if this is a reasonable thing for him to do or not, its not that big of a deal after all but I hate being controlled or manipulated and thats how Im feeling right now thats why its important to me.

Im 19F and my friend is 20M, we often play games together or just chat after work but this is making me seriously reconsider who I am friends with. I have level 1 autism so please go easy on me if Im not undersfanding an obvious social clue.

Yesterday evening we decided to play Baldurs Gate 3 together, something we have been doing regularly most evenings and he asked if a friend of his can join the call since they are lonely and wanted to talk to him while we play (The friend is 19NB). I reluctantly agreed even being extremely insecure about my voice which I dont use to talk to most people, but I suppose I was having a good day so I agreed. We continued playing the game and he added the person to the call on discord, it was very awkward at first but then we both kind of opened up and started getting comfortable talking to eachother.

For context my boyfriend M30 + and I F19 have been together for almost 1 year and a half. He‚Äôs my first ever REAL relationship. He recently brought up to me that he wants to completely focus on growing himself. I‚Äôve always tried my absolute best to support him in everything. So I heard him out. He‚Äôs recently in the process of becoming a manager, and he works very long hours. My BF says we are not breaking up. So no, This is not a post where the boyfriend says, ‚ÄúI need to work on myself I can‚Äôt be in a relationship right now.‚Äù No. But this is one where this is exactly what he wants.. He wants to focus all his time on work, learning more about work, his goals, seeing friends, and of course, his family. Also added context, He‚Äôs had a very strange history w/ his family. At least one where I think he‚Äôs pushing it a little, but maybe not. That's why i'm writing this. My BF used to spend every waking second w/ them before me. To the point that that was his only life outside of his goals. Every vacation. Every outing. Every single event. One time he was asked the question, ""who do you love more, your sister or your girlfriend?"" and he said his sister. It was just a joke apparently. Maybe I don‚Äôt see his perspective I‚Äôll admit. I‚Äôve never been a deep family woman. But I have a great relationship w/ my parents + sibling.  He says at the end of the day or beginning he‚Äôll make time to talk. He says he doesn‚Äôt want to talk for hours anymore (we definitely don‚Äôt speak for hours, he‚Äôs always at work or doing something but even when we do talk it's 90% about him) He tells me ‚ÄúSometimes I won‚Äôt call after work because I have the gym or I‚Äôll fall asleep.‚Äù He already works 40+ hours and after those 40+ I barely get a couple minutes? He says that this is healthy for us. I 100% want to support this. He also encourages me to work on myself and not focus on him. And I love that idea. the idea of being able to find myself in this. But he‚Äôs already gone all the time. And adding this on top of it feels like he‚Äôs completely disappearing from my life. Just a voice I can speak to at the end of the night after a long day (but only for a couple minutes because he needs his time). And I find that when we do spend time together all he talks about is his work. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm doing this in my work‚Ä¶‚Äù or Work this. Work that. I‚Äôm not talking 1 hour. No sometimes it goes on for hours. On our dates.. work. And even in our intimate times he brought up something from work it was so embarrassing. And if it‚Äôs not work (rare) it‚Äôs something about him. One time I started bawling my eyes out because one night he got off work he spent almost 2 hours talking about work but then when I wanted to talk about myself or what I did he just wanted to get off the phone and kept interrupting me..

66,1ga6297,AITA for sleeping with another guy than my boyfriend ,"For a little bit of background, I (18F), before meeting my current boyfriend (18M), I had a very good friendship with this guy who we will call Lucas (18M). Our friendship had a really weird start to it tho since I met Lucas through my best friend at the time and we only started getting closer when my best friend and I stopped talking. We got put into the same class so, we‚Äôd see each other pretty often which naturally aloud us to get super close with each other to the point where we had a  weekly tradition where we would make cupcakes after class at his house for his mom and his little brother but, also from time to time, he would rush to my house begging me to use my skin care routine because he swears he would break out if he didn‚Äôt (this man has the clearest skin ever naturally). Anyways we‚Äôve been through a bunch of little adventures and we had a bunch of inside jokes from all the things that we‚Äôve done. Not only that but we also confined in each other quite often and he was truly the first person I wanted to talk to when something was wrong because we basically had the exact same mindset. 

There‚Äôs one thing tho, I hadn‚Äôt realized at first because, I truly thought this man was bluffing or whatever, but he had the biggest crush on me. Every time he was drunk he would call and text me saying things like ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù, ‚ÄúI want you but you wouldn‚Äôt want me back‚Äù, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre mine‚Äù, ‚ÄúPlease break up with your boyfriend‚Äù or even ‚ÄúId chose you over my mother‚Äù and this is coming from a mommas boy. Now, looking back I realize how dumb I was for not noticing sooner but, I swear every time he was sober it was truly all friendship, ‚Äúew she‚Äôs like a sister to me‚Äù vibes. My boyfriend on the other hand did notice and asked me to cut him off, which was hard for me to say the least cuz we did keep on and off contact for a while after that. 

Until one day, my boyfriend truly had enough and told me to chose between them both so, me and Lucas scheduled a last meeting where he took me out clubbing and payed fully for the Uber and alcohol which ranged to over 100$. During that night I was pressured into drinking a little bit although Lucas completely denies it and I ended up pretty drunk. The night  ended up pretty fun, him and I, sat together in a calmer space of the club and talked all night. Only problem was  I had to reject Lucas advances all night because he kept insisting for us to kiss and I kept saying ‚Äúno‚Äù very clearly and I kept constantly bringing up my boyfriend talking about how much I loved him and how he is truly the man of my life because the last thing i wanted to do is give this man the wrong idea. Anyways, fast forward to the end of the night, Lucas battery was almost completely drained (close to 1%) so he quickly called the Uber for us inputting my address. I did slightly questioned him on that but, he payed for the whole night and I‚Äôm truly a people pleaser so I kept my mouth shut. Once we arrived at my house, I was physically exhausted and didn‚Äôt want to deal with what was going on. All I really wanted to do is go to bed, which is exactly what we did but mind you, it wasn‚Äôt the first time we had a sleepover and we thought ‚Äúwell this is our last night as friends, why not?‚Äù All I remember is me trying to go to bed as Lucas kept rambling about how this is our last night together and as I tried falling asleep I remember kinda being waken up by him ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù putting his lip on mine so I backed up and told him ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt count if I don‚Äôt kiss you back‚Äù then, I completely turned around to face to wall and that‚Äôs when I remember falling asleep.  Although at some point I do remember waking up to Lucas full on crying so I gave him a hug and fell asleep again. 

The next day, me and Lucas say our final goodbyes and I meet up with my boyfriend when suddenly he gets a text from his friend telling him that his girlfriend is cheating on him and there‚Äôs proof. I‚Äôm super confused at this point and confident that I didn‚Äôt in fact cheat on my boyfriend so I obviously ask for proof and his friend says Lucas has photos and videos. So we text Lucas immediately and ask him for the ‚Äúproof‚Äù. Lucas is hesitant at first and tells my boyfriend that if he sends the proof he scared that I‚Äôll be mad at him or that I won‚Äôt ever talk to him which was obviously true because tell me why this man as a picture WITH FLASH of him and I, laying down, having our lips together in my bed. Im just as shocked as my boyfriend at that point because I truly don‚Äôt know when this happened and if he did how did I not notice the flash. To this day, I‚Äôm still confused.

So last weekend, I was at a restaurant with my girlfriend, and I needed to go to the bathroom.

He kept going, saying it‚Äôs for disabled people. I got frustrated and said just because he‚Äôs in a wheelchair doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs more entitled to use it than someone with an invisible disability like mine.

 He called me rude and said he shouldn‚Äôt have had to wait, but I told him again that just because he‚Äôs in a wheelchair doesn‚Äôt mean he never has to wait for the toilet. He called me an AH and said I shouldn‚Äôt use the disabled toilets in the future.

71,1ga4xfh,"AITA for ""gossiping"" about my friend","I, 17M, was told about a week ago by one of my close friends that one of our mutual friends Rochelle, 17F, had started to date/talk/speak to a guy called Deshawn after recently been broken up with by her previous boyfriend. I didn't really care when my friend told me this, I didn't tell anyone else that day. 

But later that day, I got a message from Deshawn asking me if I thought that Rochelle had a crush on him. That didn't come to much because I told him what I thought, which was that I didn't really know what was going on and that they could figure it out themselves. He told me that him and Rochelle weren't speaking at all. I was a little worried because I've known R for a long time and she can take a lot of her emotional validation from men and doesn't like being single.

So the next day I asked someone that I know is currently really close with her, Ali, also 17F, if R had been speaking to Deshawn. She confirmed that R had been, and that they weren't actually dating but they had been seeing each other. Ali also told me that the reason people knew was because they'd been seen making out in town (not something I have an issue with but is relevant again).

Later in the day after I spoke to Ali, I got a message from R on snap which said something very close to the effect of 'can u stop telling ppl stuff thanks x'. I thought it was a bit weird considering I didn't really think I'd told anyone but I wasn't looking for an argument so I said 'u got it', she replied 'it's not really ur business to tell', and I told her that I hadn't really told anyone and she asked me who had. I didn't want to tell her originally because the guy that told me had been really good friends with her and I'm not a grass, so I didn't reply.

But after not replying to her, Deshawn also messaged me. It was a really long-winded and honestly stupid conversation but it was to the effect of that they WEREN'T dating, that they DIDN'T want people to know, and that I'd been a bastard basically for going around and spreading it. I told him that I had only talked to Ali about it, but he didn't believe me and I honestly didn't feel the need to prove myself to him like that. 

After I finished up my conversation with D, I told him that I wouldn't tell anyone else and that they could do whatever the fuck they wanted and I didn't care. 

I texted Rochelle after and told her that I didn't want us to have any bad blood, apologised if I had caused any tension, and asked if we were good. She replied with 'yh' and has been acting really weird with me ever since. Her and Deshawn apparently had a really big issue (idk what it was) and she's now dating some guy called Eric but she doesn't talk to me anymore.

I don't know if I honestly did something wrong. I'd wanted to talk to her about how she tends to just get with new guys whenever she feels sad, but it feels like she'd just get pissed at me for mentioning it again and I do genuinely want to be her friend.

In 2019 a man got infatuated via SM. I told him no, he has some pretty hateful views & went out of his way to say inappropriate things to me. He knew that was wrong. 

He has since attempted ‚Äúto apologize‚Äù. But He always winds up trying to make me think I ‚Äúdrove him to it‚Äù, instead of just saying what he said was obviously shitty & shutting up like an actual remorseful person. 

He never said sorry for MOST of the bad things he said to me. He addressed a couple things only because people got on his case. Clearly did the bare minimum to try to take the heat off himself. Not that he was genuinely sorry TO ME for being so vile. 

So, when he wanted to be friends I decided I didn‚Äôt want to. When he said I‚Äôd be his buddy if I forgave him I concluded then I don‚Äôt forgive him. 

On top of being shitty most of what he said wasn‚Äôt true & when I politely corrected Stalker he just kept arguing with me about MY life. If he doesn‚Äôt even value being intelligent then there‚Äôs no point in forgiving him no matter how sorry he is/isn‚Äôt & for what. Any further chatting with him would be a stupid waste of time. 

Additionally he continued his stalking/harassing/threatening behavior while he was supposedly ‚Äúsorry‚Äù. Never did apologize for MOST of his hateful words/actions. All he did was call me an asshole for not answering him. A lot. I‚Äôd block him, he‚Äôd come back, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre an asshole for ignoring me‚Äù. 

I wasn‚Äôt forcing creeper to guess the issue-1)I don‚Äôt have to be friends with guys who bully me 2)Things I wanted addressed, I‚Äôd raised at the time they occurred. All he would have needed to do was look over the interaction. Makes it extra shitty later on he got mad at ME for not looking at stuff he said to me seriously. Hmmm‚Ä¶ 

Plus when I‚Äôd articulate I was uncomfortable he accused me of trying to ‚Äúforce him to apologize‚Äù. When I‚Äôd ignore him same gig. He got that because I mentioned my parents were chaotic growing up & I guess he thought bringing up they used to have issues actually saying sorry was going to make me think I was unwise rejecting him. No & he had no business in my family affairs. Never said sorry for that either. Sure doesn‚Äôt like being treated like he treated me. 

He‚Äôs still trying to pester me, so obviously he didn‚Äôt feel any regret. Never admitted how crappy it was to pressure me to be pals without actually addressing ALL the stuff he did to me. 

I understand on one level it‚Äôs good to let drama go. But that shouldn‚Äôt result in setting myself up for more drama. Given the stalker is still harassing me & clearly lied about being sorry, I just think there is no point in me trying to forgive him. He ISN‚ÄôT sorry. He even admitted he was trying to manipulate me. I think my emotional energy is better served spent on loved ones who are actually good & supportive things in my life.

73,1ga3tpf,AITA for trying to stand up for myself?,"
Okay so this story is from like a long time ago, when I was about 10 or 11 years old.
We had this project in school about Egypt, so I made something out of clay and there were like hieroglyphs on it and everything, however I was not finished yet. I was looking through the clay tools and then I found this broken of spatsula thingy that was now kinda sharp, which was perfect because I wanted to use it to kind of scrape my sculpture to make it smooth and improve my detailing. 
While I was using this literal piece of trash in peace, one of my classmates had seen me use it and walked over to ask if he could use it after me. I appreciated that he asked me first, but I was not nearly done with my 'masterpiece' and so I told him that it would be a while before I would be done. 
This was, in my opinion, a completely decent decline to his request but he did absolutely not agree with me on that.
I do not exacte remember how the conversation got out of hand, because it was like 9 years ago, but the next thing I know is that he was getting angry at me for not geving him that stupid spatsula. I don't know why I didn't just give it to him, but I guess I wasn't willing to just give it up, because he couldn't handle me saving 'no'. So the alternative was confrontation, and a lot of it as well.
To my knowledge, I was only having this argument with this one perticular classmate, however the other kids in my class caught sight of what was happening and started to get involved, circling around me, shouting at me and calling me names. Everybody had gotten just so angry at me so quickly, that I just didn't know what to do
I remember how I just sat there with my head down crying while the clay creation sat underneath my head slowly getting coveren in my tears.
I wondered where the teacher was and why nobody in the entire classroom had said something to at least releave me from the absolute blow of kids screaming in my face. 
I can't remember exactly what happened next, but eventually the teacher had gotten between me and the other kids and calmed things down.
Then everybody had to explain what had happened, so I obviously had gotten the blame for everything just because I wouldn't hand over the weird tool thingy. At the end it's my word against theirs'.
This was a regular and also reaccuring thing with me and my classmates. I was usually just doing what I thought was alright and then somebody would disagree and others would get involved. And then again it was just me against everybody else, I swear nobody had ever gotten my back or defended me in some kind of way (except for my brother but he wasn't always around to help me).
In this period in my life I felt kinda alone and like nobody would listen to what I would have to say. Like a nightmare where you can scream all you want but nobody will hear you. 
So was I the a**hole in this scenario, should I have just given that guy the spatsula?
Stubborn little me was certainly not gonna.

I am in my 40s. My parents are/were in their early to mid 70s. My dad passed away in March last year.

My family was devastated. I was devastated. I am still devastated. I live in the same city as my parents but my sisters do not. Family, friends, and neighbours came together to be there for my mom. I was executor the estate. I did all the things I had to do to get his affairs in order and transfer things into her name, etc. We sat as a family and agreed together no big changes for a year. Since then, it has been nothing but big changes. 

My mom reconnected with a friend of theirs from their 20s and 30s. He is also a widower but has been for a few years. He gave a speech at my dad‚Äôs celebration of life about their time working closely together. This was in June. In the summer, my mom took off.

She told me they were in love and were getting married. I cried immediately but pulled myself together. They‚Äôve booked a date for spring 2025. 

I understand that she is older and doesn‚Äôt have much time left. If there‚Äôs ever a time for her to be selfish it‚Äôs now. The more love in the world the better.

Today I had some extra time and decided the dog was scuzzy. I had been putting off washing him because it is a big task and isn't always as necessary as I thought (Huskies have self cleaning fur? Not sure... Idk.) ....So I did it in the shower. The only hose we have is outside our front door in between the other neighbors front doors (apartment complex). I don't feel comfortable washing my dog right outside my neighbors front door with a hose. Idk it could just be me but I really don't like to be in everyone's way and disturbing anyone. 

I covered the shower drain with a washcloth and cleaned the shower afterwards, collecting any and all dog hair I could find. Wiped the walls and cleaned the floor. I'm the one who cleans the bathroom anyway. 

He came home saw a pile of towels and asked what it was from and I straight up told him. He hasn't spoken to me all night and is crazy upset with me. Previously I had gotten drunk at a friend's wedding and told him I let the dog get in the bed with me after he asked me not to. I know I'm breaking the rules and betraying his trust.

My MIL lives about 6 hours away and today (the day before we leave) she said that she would love to see us for lunch/dinner while we on our trip.

I didn‚Äôt mind so much last year, but this year I‚Äôm refusing to meet her.

For one, money has been tight and the only reason we can make this trip is because we pretty much paid for the whole thing while I was still working (pregnancy has been pretty hard for me). This is probably the last fun trip we can realistically afford for a while, and it‚Äôs definitely the last trip that will be just me and my husband for a long time. I don‚Äôt want to see any family on the trip, especially since it‚Äôs specifically meant for us to focus on our relationship.

Another issue I have is that we have had these plans for a long time, and we find out less than 12 hours before getting on a flight that we need to check our schedule for the week to fit in a last minute thing. Maybe if she had brought it up earlier I would be less mad, but now the picture I have in my head for this trip doesn‚Äôt have room for the emotional energy it takes to be social with my MIL.

My husband says that I‚Äôm being harsh and that she would be driving pretty far to just have a meal with us. He stresses that she only has good intentions. I get that, but idc how far she has to drive bc she wasn‚Äôt invited. If we wanted to have a family trip we wouldn‚Äôt go somewhere she has to drive so far to see us.

Last year the trip was longer and we met MIL after the event, this year we fly in 1 day before event and fly out 2 days after. MIL is not available to meet the day after the event so dinner would have to be on a day we are also flying

MIL does normally live far away from us, but she intentionally moved that far to get away from family. She lives at least a full day of driving from her brother and 2 days away from us.

77,1ga2r2t,AITA for telling my single friend to 'get a boyfriend',"I 22M, am dating my bf, Jack, 22M. That is not a typo, we're gay. I often like to get him flowers. He doesn't particularly like flowers, and it started kind of as a joke/light bullying, because of the common stereotype of gay guys being feminine and flowers being girly. But now its a pretty nice tradition.

Over the weekend, my friends and i went out as a group, and i got Jack flowers. Our friend group is mixed of guys and girls, and one of my mates, Alex, made a joke about me not being a gentleman and getting some for everybody. Jack then gave him one of the flowers and he gave an exaggerated bow. It was very jokey not serious at all.

Here's where things get a little weird, Amy (21F) did not seem to like this joke at all. Like spent the entire thing kind of vaguely sulking. I thought i was imagining it, but she came to me at the end and told me it was rude of me to get ***my boyfriend*** flowers and not the girls at the table. 

I told her she was being strange, and it's not my job to get anyone who isn't Jack flowers. She said I let Alex have one, and he is 'not even a girl'. I don't know if I came off rude here, but i was just genuinely completely like stunned and confused af, so I told her to 'get a boyfriend' if she wants flowers so damn bad.

She told me I was being misogynistic by saying she 'needed a man to buy her flowers'. I realise I may have implied that, but i don't think it was really an asshole thing to do, since she is straight, and seemed to want to ave flowers bought for her, not to buy them herself. I didn't answer and might have 'given her the stink eye' which i kinda do by mistake when someone says something really dumb or confusing. 

Anyway, she said i'm an asshole, and has been kinda off in group chats lately. Is something flying straight over my head?

78,1ga2oaw,WIBTA If I reported my mom for credit card fraud?,"I (25nb) recently got an email from credit karma letting me know my ~700pt credit score had dropped about 200pts.

I looked into the cause and found it was a card my mom had opened in my name nearly a decade ago that she had overutilized and stopped paying on.

I did know about this card, when I opened my own ""first"" credit card she told me she had opened it as a surprise to establish credit for me, I'd never had a choice in the matter.

She is in the middle of a divorce rn that I don't feel comfortable sharing all the details of, and that made me feel like I couldn't be upset about this, but she is taken care of and as far as I know didn't NEED the money.

I messaged her about this and she apologized, said her mental health had been dodgy, she needed the money, and that I should dispute the charges.

However, upon posting in personalfinance I learned that what she did (opening a card in my name without my knowledge) is credit card fraud and the only way I can get rid of it is to report the fraud to the police.

This isn't the first time she's done something like this but it is the worst she's done to me financially. I still love her but she really, really fucked me over this time.

Thus all college courses had a required swimming class. Today was the exam for the swimming class, I was one of the best swimmers there. 

This confused me, because technically I'm not entirely local to the area so I should be worse off then my classmates but alas I was better.

After class I talked to my classmates about it and apparently none had the luxury to swim as often ad I did and thusly was the reason why they couldnt swim as well. The topic then shifted to local swimming areas.

I started talking about swimming areas near town and went on about how the waters were really calm and how easy it was to swim to the deeper parts of the water where all the cool fishes and coral were. I did this without thinking, the ocean is honestly one of my favorite places so I went on and on.

One of my classmates then interrupted saying how the area I was talking about was actually rough during high tide and in the deeper areas. 

Without thinking I replied that compared to other countries that had big neck snapping waves, the ocean near us had calmer waves over all and even if it was a bit rough I could take it easily.

My classmates then said ""Well good for you, you're able to compare."". After that I had to leave the pool and go home. It wasnt until the car ride home that I realized what I had implied onto my classmates. I also didnt realise their tone until this time. It's been stuck on my head ever since.

Gabby would forget to ask for rabies vaccine records even though it's highlighted in red for new clients (or it expired). She would not speak up even if a dog gets loose. She refuses to ask questions or ask for help, even if our direct manager asks.

Gabby would forget to ask for rabies vaccine records even though it's highlighted in red for new clients (or it expired). She would not speak up even if a dog gets loose. She refuses to ask questions or ask for help, even if our direct manager asks.

That's only part of it. I know I've had my own struggles but I've been told I'm improving. Other girl and I would ask how to do something if we forgot or haven't gone over it.  Management had multiple meetings with Gabby and told her where she can improve.

In the end, the store decided to let Gabby go last week because they don't have the budget to continue training her as it is. Gabby left a bad review of the store saying we don't offer training and she got fired because she wasn't learning fast enough. Then she reached out to me and asked if she can use me as a reference. It doesn't sit right with me that she blames other people for it so I said no. Gabby believes I conspired against her because I said no and bitched about it.

I live pretty close by to his school but he never asks to come over.

89,1ga0xc5,AITA for wanting my roommates to return the cat they adopted without my okay?,"(TLDR: I‚Äôm allergic to cats. My roommates got a cat without consulting me, now they are mad I want them to return the cat.)

I want to preface with the fact I am allergic to cats. I live in a three bedroom apartment with my two roommates (Alex and Taylor). The apartment isn‚Äôt that big, which we all previously agreed the space was pretty limited. We have one cat already, which Alex got just before we moved in. Thankfully, that one is shorthaired and I am not allergic to him.

Recently, Taylor mentioned wanting a cat and Alex said it would be cute if their cat had a friend. I agreed it would be cute as I thought it was just passing conversation. Then they started asking me about it. First, right when I walked in the door what my opinion about a second cat was and my response was ‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶üò¨ I don‚Äôt know about that..‚Äù Then again while I was washing dishes with my headphones on and I didn‚Äôt hear them. And again about fostering one, my response being ‚ÄúBut fostering isn‚Äôt just fostering, you will end up keeping the cat.‚Äù Again, I thought that it was all just talk about the possibility of getting another cat because I expected a serious sit down discussion about it as we do share this apartment.

A few days ago they both went to the shelter to ‚Äúlook‚Äù at the cats and Taylor adopted a cat without getting my consent first. I only find out 7pm through Taylor‚Äôs story that they had adopted a kitten. I got no text or heads up that day about it at all. Taylor said they planned to sit down and have a talk with me AFTER already getting the cat, but hadn‚Äôt because Alex was at work.

I meet the cat and I do think he is adorable, but immediately my throat and eyes got scratchy. When Alex got back from work, they told me ‚ÄúI had no idea Taylor was doing that today‚Ä¶‚Äù acting surprised to my face. I then confide in Alex, explaining I am allergic to this cat and I‚Äôm not too thrilled. 

Taylor texted me the next day saying ‚Äúif you‚Äôre really allergic, it‚Äôs not a big deal. I can return the cat.‚Äù I responded ‚ÄúI am allergic to the cat. I don‚Äôt think it is fair to the cat to return him the day after adoption. This could have been avoided had you asked me before adopting him. I don‚Äôt appreciate not being told about this.‚Äù

They both claim I never gave them an answer if they could get this second cat (In my opinion, if it‚Äôs not an enthusiastic yes, it‚Äôs a no). It turned into a back and forth argument of me explaining myself and Alex calling me selfish because I want Taylor to return the cat that I 1) never agreed to having and 2) am severely allergic to. Finally after having a sit down conversation, Taylor agreed to return the cat. Alex continued calling me childish, selfish, immature, and a horrible friend‚Ä¶even though it is not their cat. 

Now neither will talk to me and Alex further cursed me out. It makes me upset because I really think this all could have been avoided had they sat me down, communicated, and asked me and gotten a real answer from me before adopting the poor thing.

92,1ga0isr,AITA for lying to my friends about being not being a virgin anymore?,"I (26F), was known as the virgin. Friends would make jokes or introduce me to newcomers as such. It lowered my self-esteem immensely. I tried to ignore it, but the lack of knowledge and relatability I had made me stressed and anxious about when I would do the deed so I could fit in. I knew I didn‚Äôt want it to be a hookup because that‚Äôs not my vibe. 

The opportunity came up a year ago as one of my friends, (25M) call him Marcus, offered to do it. At the time it seemed ideal. We both lacked in that department so it was like ‚ÄúYou scratch my back, I scratch yours‚Äù. I felt platonic towards him. Especially since he had a crush on my friend, (26F) call her Nina. She was in a relationship with another guy in our group. We knew his chances with her were slim. 

We did it and it was not great for me. I still saw this as a win because I had finally learned more. Before I left, Marcus made me swear I wouldn‚Äôt tell anyone. He didn‚Äôt want our judgemental friend group to find out. I considered how it would be a low point for me if they found out I had slept with him of all people and how it could also ruin his chances with Nina in the future, so I agreed.

As time went on, I attended social events playing along with the virginity jokes. Marcus joined in to be aloof.

My mind raced with so many thoughts, do I reach out to him and ask if we should tell her and ruin the opportunity for them to be together? Do we tell everyone and accept humility? Do I tell her myself and go against my word? I was scared about how people‚Äôs perceptions of me would change.

Nina and Marcus dated very quickly after her split. I was happy for them, but felt impending doom as I spent more time with her and acted like nothing happened between Marcus and I. The burden of guilt was eating me alive. I didn‚Äôt want to screw up something good they both had.

94,1ga0emo,AITA for arguing with my Mom about our laundry?,"I know this is a stupid argument between me and my mom but I had to vent it somewhere.

Okay so context, my current blanket was taken for laundry so I had to use a old bedsheet as my blanket because we don't have any other blanket.

So after I got my new clean blanket I put the old bedsheet to the floor because I wanted to use it as a rag temporarily then have it cleaned because we go to the laundry shop on 2 days. It doesn't fit any of our new beds so it's practically useless 
So back to the present, my mom saw it and told me to put it back to where it belongs and I said that I was planning to use it as a rag but was gonna put it in the laundry to use it again as a substitute blanket in case my current blanket is in the laundry again. 

She told me to put it in the laundry and to fold it and I was said, okay but why do I need to fold it? 

We've never fold our laundries and before and it doesn't matter if its folded or not because it's gonna be put in a washing machine anyway so it's just gonna unfold.

She told me so that the laundry baskets don't  look TOO full. Bear in mind that we have 2 laundry baskets, 1 for me and my dad and 1 for my mom and my sister. So it shouldn't concern her because I was gonna put my beadsheet in my laundry basket and not her's.

So there's no connection on her reasoning because A, me and my dad are the ones that are in charge of the laundry packing and B, she rarely helps out in the laundry and even then I'd be just her gathering her clothes, I'm the one that is still gonna pack it. C, we've never even folded the current bedsheets we use now.

She told me to put it in the laundry and to fold it and I was said, okay but why do I need to fold it? 

We've never fold our laundries and before and it doesn't matter if its folded or not because it's gonna be put in a washing machine anyway so it's just gonna unfold.

She told me so that the laundry baskets don't  look TOO full. Bear in mind that we have 2 laundry baskets, 1 for me and my dad and 1 for my mom and my sister. So it shouldn't concern her because I was gonna put my beadsheet in my laundry basket and not her's.

So there's no connection on her reasoning because A, me and my dad are the ones that are in charge of the laundry packing and B, she rarely helps out in the laundry and even then I'd be just her gathering her clothes, I'm the one that is still gonna pack it. C, we've never even folded the current bedsheets we use now. 

So basically AITA for arguing with my mom when she told me to fold my bedsheet despite us never folding our laundry before and that especially at the fact that she rarely helps at said laundry packing?",1.0,1.0453828573226929,1,1
95,1ga06oj,AITA for indirectly ruining a friendship between two of my good friends?,"I'm in touch w a few friends from college but I will specifically reference Sasha 'S' & Grace 'G'. S was in my sorority and G was through another club on campus. Neither S nor G were friends in college bc I attended a large uni. S and I both moved to ATX for work and G ended up moving to Chi. One wknd, G ended up visiting me for the weekend in ATX and met S - they hit it off. G ends up visiting ATX a few times that year, giving S&G the oppty to hang out more in person. After a few of G's consecutive visits to ATX, S and I plan a trip to Chi for St. Patty's. Funny enough, G was actually planning to come back to ATX the following week for another event.

When S and I visited Chi, S unfortunately had a migraine and was unable to enjoy most of the trip. She spent most of the time on G's couch, but came out to a pg hosted by one of G's friends. While at the pg, S met some of G's other friends that live in Chi and basically trauma dumped to ppl that she was meeting for the first time. If she wasn't talking about her issues or taking pics, she was sitting on G's friend's couch looking miserable. S would also tell us to be quiet or keep lights off at G's apt, which upset G bc she felt like she needed to tiptoe in her own house. I will also add that S pretty much trashed G's apt - she left her dirty clothes & trash all over her floor and her migraine was the excuse. 

The next week, G was flying back to ATX for an event that all three of us were going to. It was an event that I was pretty much facilitating, and S and G were my guests for the evening. S was the reason why her and G showed up late to my event and throughout the event, S showcased poor attitude bc she thought the event was boring. She ended up leaving early and I was upset about that. G was also frustrated with S because of how she acted in Chi the week prior. 

Once G left town, her and I had expressed our frustrations with S. I wanted to sit down with her to talk about how her actions made me feel. G wanted to do the same. I ended up telling G to hold off on talking to S until I had the oppty to tell her how I felt first. I waited for the right oppty to talk to her, as I wanted to talk to her in person about this. However, schedules got pretty busy and I wasn't able to see S until a few wks ltr. S had another migraine and other issues going on, so I ended up holding back bc I didn't want to add to the pile of issues she was dealing w. I ended up not talking to S bc my feelings ended up subsiding and felt like it was no longer worth bringing something up that upset me two months ago at this point. G also never had the oppty to express her frustrations & spaced out her communication with S ever since. Whenever S reaches out to G, she barely gets a response and S always asks me if G is mad at her.

97,1g9zz7b,AITA to leave my little one with his grandparents to go out for dinner with my first born?,"My husband of 5yrs and I just got into a text argument. He told me multiple times he didn‚Äôt have any work tomorrow so I made a reservation for the 4 of us with my 15yo (not his) and our 3yo to eat at my first born‚Äôs favorite restaurant.

He then told me earlier he overlooked his schedule and needs to work tomorrow. Our 3yo  is autistic and doesn‚Äôt do well outside so everytime we bring him outside, we make sure there are both of us or at least 2 adults to assist. So I asked him if he can ask his parents to watch our 3yo while my 15yo and I can bond and go out for dinner, given this is both our birthday month also.

He told me I was unfair for just leaving our 3yo like that and not wanting to bring him with us. We got into an argument and I told him if we‚Äôre taking about being fair, doesn‚Äôt he think it‚Äôs unfair everytime they buy clothes and shoes for our 3yo but they barely give anything to my 15yo? I honestly didn‚Äôt care before but I just think that is more unfair on my 15yo not receiving anything while his brother is getting a lot of things.

I also read a thread here the other about this and how they should also treat my son as their own - I can no longer find the thread though.

I know my son is already a teenager and it‚Äôs not their responsibility but I just don‚Äôt see anything wrong also with me wanting to leave our 3yo with his grandparents as I know he will be happier and better there than sitting with us in a crowded restaurant.

Looks like he‚Äôs still not arranging for his parents to look atfter our 3yo though. My plan is to maybe just bring my half brother who is the same age as my teenager so they can have fun while I look after our little one and we can still go out for dinner and will schedule a different bonding time with my teenager.

In terms of my husband‚Äôs reaction and dealing with the situation, I have yet to really think about it so I can figure out my best next steps.

Regardless, yes I realized me bringing up them buying our son gifts is irrelevant, I was just upset he called me unfair so I had to say something, I already said sorry to him.

He hasn‚Äôt once asked me how I get money, I think he pray that it isn‚Äôt sex.

he is a major conspiracist, ever since lockdown 2020, it‚Äôs brainwashed him. And he thinks we are the brainwashed ones lmao.

The context for this is that he said he would change my oil if I got him coffee and wash our dog. Even though the dog was washed 2 weeks prior.

I also cleaned all day at home yesterday.

And our dogs leg has been limping for a while but my dad doesn‚Äôt agree with vets. Such an idiot. But it‚Äôs his dog and his rules.

100,1g9ze2t,AITA For Trying to Bring a Bike into an Apartment.,"For context, I live in an apartment with 4 other people. For the longest time, I was parking my bike in our garage. However, my old bike was stolen from the garage. This likely occurred because one of my roommates was running a cord through the window to charge their car which was parked outside. I expressed hesitancy with the opening, but they assured me that the curtain rod they put in place to minimize the opening would keep things shut. As a result of this, they agreed to pay \~35% of the cost of my new bike.

Because of this, I don't feel comfortable having my bike outside even if we move their vehicle inside to remove the opening. This is because the garage door has a lock that can be picked. So, I picked out a corner of our apartment that is not used for anything else and ensured the bike wasn't blocking the walkway or anything like that. I then communicated to our group that I would be leaving the bike here for the time being and explained my reasons for why I didn't feel my bike way safe under other suggestions (like leaving the bike on the balcony where people could see it). I have considered many options but feel like either 1. having the bike inside or 2. putting it in the back of my car when my car's in the garage would work. They have parked their car in the garage and refuse to move it because they don't want another gap in the window.

Coming back to the bike inside, I said I would be willing to buy a mat to put under the bike to minimize dirt and debris and would clean up after myself (I didn't specify in that message how often, but I clean every weekend so I would do it then). My roommate then threatened to throw my bike outside and did so that night. Their logic is that it's disrespectful to have items in the common space, especially ones that large. I agree with the principle, but don't understand how, given everything I've described, that this a heinous offense. I have talked to my roommates and 2 don't want to have the bike inside and 3 don't care. Additionally, I have reached out to my roommates and an ex-roommate to mediate conservation between myself and the one who threw the bike outside because they refuse to talk to me.

They have said, in different texts, that ""I don't care about their point of view"" and ""I'm not spending any more time on a f\*\*\*ing bike"" They claim that I'm being disrespectful because ""we agreed on the house rules so he's acting like he has more privileges"".

So my story starts about a month ago when all my school friends my boyfriend ‚ÄòM 18‚Äô who I have been with for two and a half years were all looking to buy tickets to a rodeo that was a 6 hour drive away. The tickets were pretty hard to get n me and my boyfriend couldn‚Äôt end up getting any but the majority of our friends did.

Two days before the rodeo my boyfriend best friend said he bought tickets off someone else n we could go with him. Because this was super last minute I already had other plans and couldn‚Äôt go but my boyfriend ended up going without me. 

It was very bad reception out there ( because it‚Äôs Australia) so I wasn‚Äôt expecting many calls from him. But to my surprise the first night at 2 in the morning he called me. He told me that he had saw one of my best friends I‚Äôll call her Lisa and when he saw her he gave her a hug. Apparently this made her boyfriend very mad and he was threatening my boyfriend. He then said that he talked to Lisa and she said it wasn‚Äôt he‚Äôs fault and that her boyfriend was just being controlling. I asked him if he was ok and we talked for about 10 minutes just about life when I said I have to go because it was already so late. 

The next day (Saturday) I didn‚Äôt hear much from him just snapping me on Snapchat when he could. On (Sunday ) when they were driving back he called me again saying that his friend was meeting up with a girl I‚Äôll call her Patti in the park and he was complaining that it was dumb because she was significantly older than him and why would his friend go for someone like that.

He came home and said he had a good time and nothing much was talked about after. Until about 3 weeks later when I met up with my best friend ‚ÄòF 18 ‚Äò I‚Äôll call her apple. Me n apple were out for dinner when say mentioned that at school Lisa was telling everyone that my boyfriend was being super weird to her and another girl ‚ÄòF 18‚Äô I‚Äôll call bread. So I messaged both Lisa and bread and they both said how he was grabbing them not necessarily in a sexual way but around the neck and pulling their hair. They also said that he was saying he was single for the night and had pictures of a naked girl on his phone and was showing it to the boys they were with. 

I immediately screen shotted the message and sent them to him asking for an explanation. We wanted to call but I was still with apple so I said I‚Äôll call him later. Apple told me that, that isn‚Äôt like him and Lisa and bread are probably taking it out of context. 

I called him and we talked for a LONG time he said that he never even spoke to bread and besides hugging Lisa he only ever tapped her on the shoulder a few times. He climes he never said he was single and that the photos for the naked girl was Patti and it wasn‚Äôt on his phone it was on his friends. He was very upset the whole phone call kept trying to make me promise I wasn‚Äôt going to break up with him and almost started crying at times.

I ended up forgiving him and ended the call as it was late n he had to get up at 3am for his work. The next week he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it at all and would get upset if a brought it up. However on the weekend I came to visit him and every time I looked at him I kept seeing him in my head saying he was single for the night. 

We were joking around pulling the piss out of each other when he said ‚Äúoh it must be so fun facing death every time you drive ‚Äú and Iooked at him with a stone could face and said it must be so fun being single for the night. We got into a big fight and he told me that I shouldn‚Äôt be bringing this up because I already forgave him and it‚Äôs in the past now.

I don‚Äôt know what to do next. Part of me thinks that he could have said that and maybe even gotten with Patti and my extreme love for him is clouding my judgment. Apple and my close friends that weren‚Äôt there are telling me this isn‚Äôt like them and Lisa and bread are taking to far. And I should forgive my boyfriend and forget my about Lisa and bread. So help me what should I do next and AITAH for saying I forgive him and not actually forgiving him.",TL;DR,2024-10-23,"AITAH ‚ÄòF 18‚Äô for not properly forgiving my boyfriend‚ÄôM18‚Äô Before I tell my story I think it is important to know that I am a helpless romantic.

My brother is higher on the autism spectrum than me and my sister, I‚Äôm kind of in the middle between them. While he can be sweet and listens sometimes, he often misbehaves, refuses to listen, makes constant noise, and is rude. I know he's young and autism can be difficult in younger children, but he understands words like ""no,"" ""be quiet,"" ""please,"" and ""misbehaving"" ‚Äî yet he chooses to ignore them. When I ask him to stop being loud or doing something he‚Äôs not supposed to, he makes excuses. He doesn‚Äôt listen properly to my mother either because she‚Äôs been babying him, and it‚Äôs really affecting me because of my own autism.

My mom tells me not to use my autism as an excuse, but she babies my brother, blaming most of his actions on his ASD. She treats me like I don‚Äôt have real needs or feelings, and thinks I‚Äôm lazy, even though I have multiple disabilities. When I try to communicate, she doesn‚Äôt really listen.

I finally expressed my bottled-up feelings about how my brother‚Äôs behavior is stressing me out. I told my mom that his constant noise, behavior, and overall actions are affecting my mental health, sleep, and energy. I also told her she needs to stop giving in to him since he's old enough to understand. I yelled and texted her about it because I‚Äôve been dealing with this for months. I know he can listen and learn because he used to, but now my mom has given in so much that he thinks things like the TV is his and he can have whatever he wants.

She got mad at me for being upset, and we had a small argument about it. But I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm in the wrong.

104,1g9ye7m,AITA for insulting my parent's boyfriend,"
I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years now. I often go to his parent's house to have supper (almost every week). They cook without salt and they don't really season their food. They don't eat fat or the skin of any meat. They're what we can say eating healthy and looking at what they're eating.

My family is Asian and we season our food with sauces, spices etc. We also use MSG, which is commonly use in asian food. 

His parents learned that he went to my family's for lunch and ate food with MSG in it. They said my family was killing themselves and eating rat poison. I told them that MSG being unsafe was just a myth and alot of studies were done to say it was safe to use and eat, and the whole misconception came from an area of racism towards Asians people. They said they wouldn't eat what my family cooks and they can't believe that i am eating food with MSG in it. No need to say that the conversation didn't go far and that we just dropped it at this point.

Later on, i talked to my boyfriend and told him how it bothered me what his parents said about my family and my culture. He said that it wasn't racism and that i was taking things out of proportion and that i am being dramatic. That I dont know anything about racism because i am more white washed than him. What really bothers me is that he didn't defend me in front of his family or said anything about the misconception. I then said to him that the comments were racists and that his parents were uneducated on the matter. Now he is offended and not talking to me. Was i out of line for saying that?

106,1g9xi5s,"AITAH For ""Getting Anxious""","Today I [M26] came home from work, and my girlfriend [F25] was telling me about her day and an interpersonal issue at work. [For context, we've lived together for 5 months and dating for 3.5 years, and things are frequently pretty rocky]. Part way through, it was clear I misunderstood an intricacy of the problem based on a question I asked her. 

She paused for about 5 seconds, and then told me I don't understand. I asked her to explain again, and didn't get a response, so I told her (in a whinier voice than I'd like to admit, although not unkind) to please not get frustrated with me.

She snapped at me pretty aggressively that she wasn't frustrated or upset, and I told her okay, I misunderstood. After that she started going off on me about how I assume things and get anxious, and I tried told her if she had just responded nicely instead of snapping, I would have dropped it instantly. I finally got the sentence out after she cut me off 5+ times by snapping ""No"" at me. I didn't snap at her once during this interaction.

This was a silly fight, and if she had just apologized, or talked to me nicely in the first place it would have been 100% fine. I told her this too, but she was focused on how I ""assume"" things.

We were silent for a few minutes, and then she came and angrily told me ""I wouldn't talk to you like this if you didn't get anxious for no reason.""

Between being cut off repeatedly then essentially being told it was my fault she snapped at me, I feel fairly upset and disrespected. I feel like the magnitude of her response was completely unjustified, especially once she doubled down.

To add some more context, I don't have no reason to be worried about things.
- She usually won't  tell me why she's upset (despite making it obvious she is) unless I pry the information out of her or wait 24+ hours
- In my opinion, a lot of the things she gets upset about are childish and blown out of proportion. Emotional swings are common for her.
- She regularly gets angry at me when I disagree with her or don't fully understand something she says
- She significantly overestimates how anxious I am in these situations
- This argument is one of the reoccurring arguments in our relationship.

Obviously, there's reasons I like being with her, and there is sometimes poor communication from both sides, but I have found myself being hurt and feeling disrespected more and more. 

I know it's hard because these types of posts can be biased, but I am just trying my best to explain how I feel here.

Another thing would be how frequently she gets into relationships and ‚Äúsituationships‚Äù. I‚Äôm not against her getting into relationships, but every single time she gets into one, I feel set aside. Like I‚Äôm not a priority because of how much she prioritizes them.

I‚Äôm finally writing this because an hour ago she finally told me that she has a crush on this guy that EVERYONE suspected she liked, but she was so adamant that she didn‚Äôt despite all the signs.

109,1g9x2d9,AITA for fighting back against my sister?,"I (21F) live with my parents and sister (18F). 

Today, I finished taking a shower and mindlessly slipped on a pair of my sister's flip flops. (the floor is often dirty and I didn't want to soil my clean feet while walking around.) Me, my mother, and sister all have our own sets of flip flops to wear around the residence, but we use each other's sandals all the time, so I didn't think it was a big deal for me to do this.  
My sister noticed me putting them on and snapped at me to take them off. I reassured her I was only going to use the flip flops for a little bit, and I'd take them off shortly.

She then wrapped her arms tightly around my waist and pulled me back against my will to prevent me from moving. Uncomfortable with being constricted, I warned her softly and sternly, saying, ""get off of me"" multiple times. She ignored me and proceeded to yell at me to take her flip flops off. I was absolutely disgusted by her childish behavior. When it was evident she wasn't letting go, I started pinching her arms and trying to walk off in an attempt to escape, but she continued to hold on. At one point she let go, and I used that as an opportunity to go to my room and get away from her. As I was leaving, I could hear my sister yelling for my mom.

  
moments later, I'm greeted by my mother angrily yelling at me for ""pinching"" and ""hurting"" my sister. I asked if she even knew what my sister did. Apparently my mother was completely fine with sis putting her hands on me because it was for a ""good reason,"" (that I didn't give back the shoes.) I told my mother that the reason behind sis attacking me was not okay, that I pinched her was because she refused to let go after my warnings and I wasn't okay with being held down against my will like that. It made me very uncomfortable. My mother not only sided with my sister on the whole matter, but she even compared me to a thief. I was offended that she would say such a thing, and I proceeded to tell her that nobody should ever put their hands on someone. My mother preached this religiously to me when I was a child. If my sis wanted her shoes back, she could have had a mature conversation with me about it instead of putting her hands on me. My mother practically ignored everything I said and demanded I give the shoes back. But because of how I was being treated, I told her, ""After that ridiculousness? Absolutely not.""  
My mother proceeded to tell me that she would not let me drive to work for an ""indefinite amount of time"" as punishment and stormed out of the room. (Since I'm an adult, I'm fully capable of going places on my own without her help. I just drive to work with my mother in the passenger seat as a means of practice since I have my permit and I'm working towards my license.)

I just feel like all of this could have been communicated WAY better, and that it was ridiculous for my mother to not only condone my sister's behavior, but to stop my driving practice over a pair of shoes.

111,1g9x079,AITA For Telling My (21M) Sister (26) That She's Endangering My Niece (8)?,"Jaz had Nova at 18 with Al. They got married a year after, and have been going through a nasty divorce now. I don't know all of the details, but it's not a no-fault issue, and Al works a job where he has very little control over his schedule. He‚Äôs extremely involved with Nova, but he simply doesn‚Äôt have the time for custody.

Nova has brittle bone disease. When she was learning how to stand up, Jaz left her in a shopping cart. Nova tried to stand but her legs stuck. Had she fallen, she could‚Äôve broken her legs; Mom got Jaz‚Äô attention. This is the only example of negligence I witnessed, but Mom and Al both swear it‚Äôs constant.

Jaz has totalled I believe 8 cars, usually with Nova.

Jaz hasn‚Äôt held a job for longer than a month in two years. Most of them, she loses or quits before two weeks. Al once told my mother that Nova said she wished she could live with him all the time because he always had food.

Over summer, Jaz hasn‚Äôt paid rent, and left her house trashed. They lived at her new boyfriend‚Äôs house with no power for a month. When Jaz‚Äô father offered to clean for her, she screamed at him for ‚Äútaking away her adulting.‚Äù

Two weeks ago, Jaz tested positive for meth. She has supervised visitation with Nova. Nova has lived at my place because I work evenings and can get her on the bus. We struggled with bussing week one because someone kept changing addresses with the bus. We suspect this is Jaz because the school system requires a pin.

I don‚Äôt mind taking care of Nova. I‚Äôve noticed some problems during visitation. Nova reverts very quickly to baby-talk with Jaz. Jaz sleeps half the time she‚Äôs here. Thursday, Jaz waited until very last minute to check Nova‚Äôs school folder and got mad Nova hadn‚Äôt completed a project due in two weeks. Then she scolded Nova for an issue Al had handled.

On Friday, Nova‚Äôs grandma picked her up instead of her grandpa. Jaz called me to ask if Mom was going to camp over the weekend. I said I didn‚Äôt know, but Nova‚Äôs grandma had already picked her up. She hung up and called my mother to scream at her that she should have been told, that she‚Äôs still Nova‚Äôs mother, and that she didn‚Äôt like my attitude. I was sick on Friday, and had a deeper voice because I‚Äôd been resting.

So, I texted her detailing almost everything above. The introduction of a complete stranger to Nova, that she had at least been somewhere with drugs, that she lost custody because CPS deemed it safer for Nova to be with someone else, that she was endangering Nova‚Äôs housing and health, and was actively trying to fuck up with me and mom so that we‚Äôd stop watching Nova.

Jaz texted back lying about doing everything CPS had told her to do, arguing that she‚Äôs more of an adult than I am and I don‚Äôt have the right to criticize her parenting. She ended by telling me that she was at rock bottom and sick of being ‚Äúdisrespected.‚Äù I do understand that the whole experience has to be hard on her too. She still won‚Äôt look me in the eyes during visitation.

112,1gaoypm,AITA for telling my husband I won‚Äôt be going to his birthday dinner since he asked if I would leave early anyway?,"For context, I will be 38 weeks pregnant on my husband‚Äôs birthday this year. 

The previous week, I reluctantly allowed his sister to pick my daughter up from school so she could spend the day with her and his parents (she does half days still). I say reluctantly because they have continuously crossed parental boundaries in the past, but that‚Äôs a different story. It had been a while, and she loves them and I truly want them to have a relationship, so I gave it another go. 

Anyway, my husband and I went to pick her up at his parents and while there, his sister asked what he was doing for his birthday coming up. I had asked him a number of times already what he wanted to do, had thrown out some ideas for us to do as a family as well, but he never decided on anything. So, he says he doesn‚Äôt have plans. She asked if he wanted her to make him dinner at her apartment then and he said yeah, that sounds good. It would be a family dinner: his parents, her partner, and our family. All good. 

Tonight, he said that we could drive separately because he doesn‚Äôt want to leave early. He asked me at dinner if I would leave early with our daughter so I could put her to bed. He wants to stay and drink and smoke and be up late. 

This majorly upset me because this whole pregnancy has not felt like a partnership what so ever. He only made one of my several ultrasounds (I‚Äôm over 35, so get a good amount of them), works almost every weekend voluntarily vs. making plans with my daughter and I, put off doing things I physically cannot do for the nursery until the third trimester I‚Äôve been asking him to do since the first. I‚Äôve also asked him to look into ways he can support me during birth and not a single google search has been made to that effect. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm being the crazy pregnant lady, but it certainly feels like he just wants to do whatever he wants without any regard to me carrying this child he told me desperately wanted (I was fine with one). Our birthdays are close, the baby‚Äôs due date is only two days after mine (so I‚Äôll be 40 weeks for my birthday if  she doesn‚Äôt decide to arrive before then). 

So for my birthday, I don‚Äôt get to do anything but be pregnant and wait for baby. It would be nice to feel like he wants to spend these special occasions with me/my daughter and I. He clearly is not empathetic to the fact that I can‚Äôt go out and do these things for this period of time, so to be told to go home he can is hurtful. 

I told him that in that case, I don‚Äôt even want to be there and she (my daughter) and I aren‚Äôt going to dinner. Honestly, I would not be in a mood to celebrate and just get upset anyway. But it does constantly feel like as much as he claims to be a family guy, spending quality time with us doesn‚Äôt matter to him.

This tenant has also been subletting half of the basement to a family of three (also not allowed in the lease).

Normally, I wouldn't care about the drug use, but my little sister lives with me and the tenant brings over a lot of men to get high with. I don't like how these men look at us and I simply do not want crackheads in my house where my sister lives.

As a kid I suffered from being raised in a small apartment without a space I can call my own and where I could be alone. I just do not want to provide the same for a future kid. I know that people can raise a kid in a shared space in the first 5 6 years in a healthy way but being able to provide a room for my kid from start is a non negotiable essentially.

We need a room for a kid and one for office, so buying a 4 room house/ apartment (1 living room, 3 bedrooms) in the next 2-3y seems like the best option.

Dan is also not satisfied with our current living space but unlike me, he doesn't want to commit to such a big purchase/ responsibility. He wouldn't say no to living in a bigger space (who would?) but doesn't want to actually put in the work or spend at once so much of his saved money. After a lot of discussion, he is kinda on board with purchasing but it's ""to help me cause I am the only one that wants it"", even thou we will both be living there.

My salary is significantly larger than Dan's and I am very very frugal. We keep our finances separate and I am able to save in a month what my fianc√© is able to save in 4-5 months. Ideally I want us both to participate with a similar amounts of money if we are going to be 50/50 on the loan and ownership of the house. But he saves a lot less, is not decreasing his spendings, not looking to switch jobs (he stayed in the same company for 5 6 years and ex colleagues with less experience than him changed companies for almost x2 salary). I am really saving for the house and if things continue like they do know, in about 2 years I will have saved on my own enough for a down payment, furniture and renovation. Meanwhile, in 2y Dan will have saved less than 25% of this amount.

I feel like the house will mostly be on my shoulders (I don't want to do it alone) and he will just get the perks of a house with little effort. I wish I had a more supportive partner, someone with whom I can share the joy of planning and reaching the next milestone together. But it feels like it's just me wanting this and just dragging him along.

AITA for wanting a house when we already have decent, free housing?

AITA for wanting him to put equal effort into saving/ planning for a house when he doesn't actually want a house? He just agreed to the plan to keep me happy and is not changing anything in his lifestyle.

AITA for being really disappointed in him when he doesn't want it as mush as I do? I feel like we aren't on the same page and we aren't doing it together

Do you guys have any similar stories/ advice?

EDIT 1. I make \~50% more than Dan. Our wedding will be small, casual and cheap. Less than 30 close family members invited. No honeymoon trips planned. 

EDIT 2. Regarding current living, we are not paying rent but we are paying all the bills for the household and our own food/ cleaning supplies/ whatever we use. We paid our part for a recent renovation as well.

Before I dive into that, I want to share something that happened a few days ago.

The catch is that Patricia's parents won‚Äôt let her date for another two years, so Jerry has to wait.

Instead, my friend asked me, but I ran off before he could make a move. It annoys me because I never liked my friends shipping me with him in the first place.

Now, back to the Raffle Rally. My friends and I were chatting when Jerry chose to sit right behind me (not sure why). Everyone was a bit bored, so I chatted with my friends and even included Jerry, even though we‚Äôre mostly just acquaintances. I noticed Patricia giving me nasty looks.

We‚Äôve talked before, not one on one, just through this family group chat we‚Äôre all in, and even then I don‚Äôt really interact with the group chat much. 

 Today, I had a pretty bad day, and while I was venting to my boyfriend, he told me he had a surprise for me that would make my day a lot better. This is the part I emphasize, for me. Throughout the day he kept saying he had a surprise for me, and would tease me by saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs ARRIVING soon‚Äù and i was thinking maybe it was like a package or something he ordered. Then eventually he comes up to me and says ‚Äúyour surprise is ready‚Äù and we get into the car and his other sister is getting in the car with us and I‚Äôm a bit confused on what it is at this point. It can‚Äôt be romantic if his little sister is coming? And if it was a package then where are we going?

We have an old friend (ex employee of ours from years ago) who comes to stay with us from out of town now & again when we need a hand - maybe like once a year.

He‚Äôs never had a serious or long term relationship to my knowledge, but has regular casual attachments with younger women. 

Anyway he texted my husband earlier this week asking if it would be ok if he brought a ‚Äòcompanion‚Äô this weekend. We discussed it and I don‚Äôt feel that comfortable having one of his fuck buddies staying in our small apartment for a few reasons‚Ä¶ A) we have been working flat out to launch the new business and will be working all weekend, B) our friend was coming on a working basis, he knows the score it‚Äôs not like we‚Äôre roping him into anything, so what‚Äôs she going to do while we‚Äôre all busy, & C) I don‚Äôt have the time or mental capacity to host in my own home at the moment - the extra cleaning and pressure that comes from having a new person in your space.

Also I should add that our apartment is above one of the restaurants.

122,1gancil,"AITA for causing a fight with my dad , and embarrassing us in front of my sister‚Äôs in laws ","My sister (24F) got pregnant and decided to get engaged with her bf. 
Long story short , my sisters in laws , hosted a dinner for the two families to meet. This wasn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds , cause my parents genuinely can‚Äôt stand each other after their divorce ( dad cheated on mom with a much younger woman , and basically dumped our family while me and my sister were still in high school, going no contact for several months ) 

Neither I nor my sister have a good relationship with our dad , and it‚Äôs almost impossible for us to not fight when we are near him , however because she is in quite a sensitive state and desperately wanting his support , my sister decided to kiss his ass quite a lot , so he can come to the dinner .  
Anyways , dad shows up , and at first he throws some shade about the pregnancy happening before the marriage, but nobody really reacts to that not wanting to ruin the mood . However I could tell that my sister was getting more and more tense as time passed, and was barely holding it in . I was also getting heated about his comments, but I was trying very hard to not cause a scene 
.

So was I TA??? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-23,"AITA for causing a fight with my dad , and embarrassing us in front of my sister‚Äôs in laws  My sister (24F) got pregnant and decided to get engaged with her bf. 
Long story short , my sisters in laws , hosted a dinner for the two families to meet. This wasn‚Äôt as easy as it sounds , cause my parents genuinely can‚Äôt stand each other after their divorce ( dad cheated on mom with a much younger woman , and basically dumped our family while me and my sister were still in high school, going no contact for several months ) 

Neither I nor my sister have a good relationship with our dad , and it‚Äôs almost impossible for us to not fight when we are near him , however because she is in quite a sensitive state and desperately wanting his support , my sister decided to kiss his ass quite a lot , so he can come to the dinner .  
Anyways , dad shows up , and at first he throws some shade about the pregnancy happening before the marriage, but nobody really reacts to that not wanting to ruin the mood . However I could tell that my sister was getting more and more tense as time passed, and was barely holding it in . I was also getting heated about his comments, but I was trying very hard to not cause a scene

All I know is that I heard him mocking me when I got on the bus, he was talking to his friend laughing at me. After a while, I see him putting his phone camera in my direction (trying to hide it but it was real obvious to me, especially since I heard him mocking me before). After 2-3 times, I looked at the camera, at him and told him ""wtf are you doing ?"", he said ""what ??"" and then lowered his eyes and started looking at his phone (I'm pretty sure he was embarrassed I caught him). He did it again twice 10 minutes later (the audacity to do it again after being caught), so I put my phone camera right in his direction as if I was filming him (I was not filming because filming someone without their consent is illegal and I just didn't want to risk it + I'm 1000000% sure he was filming/taking pictures but I did not actually see the content of his phone so yk even tho I have no doubts at all I still didn't want to do something). He was sure I was filming him, he looked at my camera on him, at me who was looking straight up in his eyes for a few seconds and then he lowered his eyes and didn't talk (even to his friend which he kept talking to before) for the rest of the bus trip. I was thinking to myself ""You like that huh ? @ssh0le"" and it was a bit relieving that I did that and to see his reaction (especially since usually, I do nothing and hate myself for not reacting when something happens to me so yk at least I did something) but I'm still f pissed cause I'm like 100% sure he took a photo of me, I just didn't have the courage to take his phone and delete my picture from it (tho I'm pretty sure he sent it to his friend(s) on a social media so even deleting it wouldn't make it disappear. But I'll be honest, I'm really not a confrontational person so even if he didn't and I would have 100% seen the picture in his phone, I still wouldn't have the courage to take it from his hands and delete it or whatever (btw as I said I didn't see my picture on his phone since he was facing the other way but I swear I know he took pictures of videos, I mean he put his phone in really unnatural positions facing ME exactly, I also heard him mocking me before, + the way he reacted when he saw me ""filming"" him, it's just all hella obvious there's absolutely no doubts. He doesn't seem like a confrontational person either because he didn't confront me and only lowered his eyes in shame or anger or guilt when he saw me ""filming"" him so I like to tell myself that he's just gonna mock me with his friends on a social media discussion instead of uploading whatever he took to a social media (I mean I'm sure he already sent it to his friends to mock me but I mean like on tiktok or smth))

Also he looked like a teen, or a freshly young adult (17-19). We know teens are dumb. I'm a young adult (22) so I'm thinking, maybe I was immature to act like him instead of ignoring. Especially since that's pretty much typical teen behavior, isn't it ?

125,1gamuu9,AITA for preventing my ex from getting 50/50 custody or our daughter?,"Ex and I separated a few months ago and in the beginning, we were in agreement that 50/50 was the best thing for our daughter. Then we went to the first mediation and I learned he expected me to be fully responsible for finding and paying for childcare on his weeks as well as my own. And if I couldn‚Äôt find childcare he expected me to pick her up in the morning before he went to work and bring her back to him when he got back to his apartment. I was not okay with that and said as much. We didn't get anywhere because he insisted all childcare-related tasks were my responsibility since I had always done them. 

After of mediation, he continued to argue with me and I told him that 50/50 custody means he is 100% responsible during his time with her and I am 100% responsible during my time. His counter-off was still 50/50 custody but she could stay with me most of the summer and he would see her everyother weekend but we still switch weeks during the school year. 

I again refused and told him ‚Äú50/50 custody means 50/50 all year long not just when it's convenient for you.‚Äù That apparently got through to him and he's told me I can have primary physical custody and he will take her every other weekend and we split holidays during the school year when he can take vacation to stay with her instead of working. 

But now he‚Äôs told his family about our disagreement and they are texting and calling me because I'm stealing his child from him. They think I should continue to be responsible for all childcare all year long since he works so hard and needs the help. His mother was being particularly vocal about it and I asked her why doesn't she volunteer to pay for childcare for him. Her response was that it's too expensive and not her responsibility. Again I disagreed because im not her son's nanny. I told the rest of his family the same thing.

I was sure I was right until his sister who I've always thought of as level-headed also told me I was being unfair. Ex hasn't ever had to do any of those tasks and he shouldn't be expected to start doing them now after so many years. Am I the asshole for telling him he's reasonable for our daughter during his time with her which is now preventing him from having 50/50 custody?

Editing because I forgot to add: I have been exceptionally careful to keep our daughter out of earshot of any verbal conversations around this and I don't let her play with my phone she won't stumble across any of the text exchanges. She loves us both and I dont want to be one of those parents that involves the child in adult matters. 

Second edit because it was brought to my attention I didn't say why us both scheduling and paying for the childcare time we need is possible. Childcare is through her school all year long.

Now, it was a petty argument, I can give you that, but we had been living together for two years at this point, before they decided to move to a different college because of personal reasons. I went to check up on them to see how they were doing and I saw the ""Add Friend"" button on Snapchat. I added them back, and their explanation was that they were just ""unadding people from [blank] College, not that deep."" They had told me that I was their ""best friend"" but I feel like best friends don't just... do that... I might just be childish, or it might just be a stupid reason to get upset at them, but please, Reddit, AITA?",4.0,0.0515278801321983,0,0

One came to the stall I was in and said I needed to go back to class now. Then I said I‚Äôm right in the middle of changing my diaper and she said I‚Äôll give you 1 minute. And it took me longer about 4 minutes to get out and I got a detention for taking to long.

When I got back to lesson the teacher was annoyed and then I explained to him why it took so long and I said everything and he thought it made sense why it took so long. But he couldn‚Äôt take off the detention so I needed my mum to take the detention of. The teachers argued with my mum and said he has to serve the detension.

131,1gakyam,AITA for refusing to massage my father's back? ,"Sorry for any mistakes, English isn't my first language 

Ok so long story short, my mom (40F) has been making me (14F) give my dad (40M) back and feet massages since I was 10. 

My dad has had problems with his back for a while now, he often has back pain due to working in construction since he was 15 to support his family back in communist Romania and now us in modern day Romania. 

Almost every night, my mom forces me to give him back and feet massages to my dad until he falls asleep, often late at night. It never lasts more than 30 minutes but I've just gotten tired of doing it. 

Today, at around 11 pm, she barged into my room to tell me to go massage his back. I was tired and it was late so I refused. She asked me to repeat, trying to intimidate me into accepting, but I still refused. 

She walked out of my room and about 2-5 minutes later walked back in, telling me to go massage his back, again. I refused, again and she got mad. 

She reminded me that I have a field trip on Friday (it was Wednesday at the time of the events) and that if I wanted pocket money for the field trip, I better go massage his back. And I refused again and she got mad, telling me she'll give me no money and to not look for her for help again and then left. 

Whenever I ask her why she doesn't give him massages instead, since she is his wife, not me, she usually makes an excuse of:
- oh but I'm not strong enough, like you are (even though she's stronger than me) 
Or
-oh but my wrists hurt and I can't apply pressure to them
Or
-oh but your dad prefers it when you do it. 

I'm not trying to make my parents look like creeps or seem entitled but I'm just tired of giving my dad back and feet massages.

133,1gaktg4,AITA For starting a band with my friend‚Äôs ex.,"Here‚Äôs the context,

The friend and I met about 8 years ago, both musical weirdos, we got along well pretty much the entire time we knew each other, but that wasn‚Äôt always the case with him and others around me. My partner (who I had started dating two years before meeting him) had to break it off with him because he tends to have a loose tongue, saying things that people usually keep to themselves i.e. commenting on her weight. This made me realize who he was, and who I was. I‚Äôm the passive type that never looks too deep into people saying conflicting things about me, so maybe I‚Äôm too nice of a person.

Fast forward 8 years.

I hadn‚Äôt talked to him in a year or two because he had lived in another city, and then he decided to come back and brought a girlfriend with him. She needed a job, so I got her a job at my work, and we became close. Within about 3 months of them moving in together (which she was paying most, if not all the rent) they have a horrible breakup. Him messing up the apartment they had, saying rude things about her. Just toxic shite. So now I‚Äôm kind of in between him, who I‚Äôve known for a long time, and his now ex, someone who I‚Äôm getting even closer to because of all this.

This is where I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm the asshole or not. When he asked me to come over and console him, I flopped on him and lied about why I couldn‚Äôt see him. I didn‚Äôt want to be the one to tell him how people perceive him badly from the things he says. I felt like i was either gonna lie just to make him feel better, or get into an argument. KEEP IN MIND, I was going through my own breakup of a 10 year long relationship, so I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to deal with his shit.

By the end of it, it all appeared to be a witch hunt against him. Everyone in the circle hated him, but a part of me always feels bad about this outcome. His ex and I started talking about a weird musical project that I‚Äôve always wanted, had hella ideas for. I didn‚Äôt perceive this mess to be something that has to get in the way of my passion.

This was June, the trip was for very end of August. Jack posted 3 more countdowns on IG.

She would tell me stories about these guys and of course I would know which one was who. Now I‚Äôm giving it another shot, I‚Äôm not stopping. 

I want her to date someone. She‚Äôs 24, turning 25. Thicc and tall, pretty eyes too. ",1.0,1.0697695016860962,1,1
138,1gak9hw,AITA for lying to my friends so I could get drunk with them?,"To start‚ÄîI, 23F am a college student. A few years ago I realized I had a serious drug and alcohol problem that went beyond typical college fun into an addiction that I nearly let ruin my college career, my family and friendships, and nearly ended my life. I‚Äôve been trying to live sober for 2 years now. 

I‚Äôve had some short relapses but typically never more than a few idiotic hours followed by intense and immediate regret.

My life is so much better since making this effort. But earlier this year I had a relapse that ruined my relationship with a whole friend group. 

I became really good friends with these girls last year and we met up once a week or so to go dancing and it became a wonderful routine. I‚Äôd never had a group of friends I felt so supported and uplifted by no matter where we went together.

They only knew me sober. I‚Äôd never drank or used drugs around them, except before I‚Äôd realized my dependency on Adderall. At the start of last fall semester I OD‚Äôd on it during a severe 3 day bender/spiral, was hospitalized, and confided in them about it. I was so embarrassed and ashamed. They were so understanding and supportive, and said to come to them before something like that happens again. I was so grateful.

Here‚Äôs where I think I‚Äôm an asshole. I‚Äôd been sober since that fall, but at the end of spring, I felt that urge again to be normal and drink with friends. Eventually came the moment I would say anything to do it.

I was going out with them and lied‚ÄîI said I‚Äôd spoken to my therapist, and had decided to do a trial run drinking again.

Of course they were supportive and said they‚Äôd keep me safe. Which was what I wanted. I felt safe with them, and the sick part of my brain wanted to use them to give myself an environment where I could drink.

That night went fine, but 2 weeks later, things went to shit.

We went out again, and I way overdid it. I pounded vodka and got wasted. I was falling, nauseous, got very touchy, so they got me in an Uber, gave me water, and took me home.

The next day I knew I‚Äôd messed up. Bad. I had sworn I‚Äôd thought things through, and they trusted me, only to realize I‚Äôd manipulated them.

I messaged all of them and apologized. Most of them said they were sorry for what I was going through and were upset and needed space. I haven‚Äôt really heard from any of them since.

One of them said she was glad I knew what I did was wrong, but what I did was unacceptable and she could not be around me. It hurt like hell, but I knew the only thing I could do for her at that point was to leave her and the rest of them alone. 

I can‚Äôt reconcile that the girl who did that and me are the same person. I‚Äôm terrified to make new friendships in case I do this again.

If there‚Äôs a silver lining here, I guess I hit my rock bottom and I‚Äôve only gone up since‚ÄîI just hate that it took hurting my friends to get there.

I know I‚Äôm an asshole, but I‚Äôve only been told I either messed up irreparably or that I just had bad friends, but I don‚Äôt think I did.

140,1gajy40,AITA for sitting on my brother's best friend's lap?,"It's not a secret that I don't like my brother's best friend Julian but lately my brother has been on my case to be nicer to him even though Julian is always goading me. I'm really trying because it's my brother's wedding soon and I don't want the day to be ruined or for me to be excluded from the wedding party because of this.

So yesterday my brother and his fianc√©e hosted a family game night. My brother's fianc√©e is Julian's cousin so he was there too. There wasn't enough room on the couch for everyone but Julian pretended to scoot over to give me room to sit. It would've made it uncomfortable for everyone if I squished in the tiny space he made for me but since my brother scrutinises my every interaction with his bestie I knew if I outright refused to sit near him he would've found a way to blame me for that too.

So, I decided to do the only thing I could. I sat on Julian's lap. He found it funny but my brother got all red in the face and asked me what the fuck I was doing. He yanked me off him and for the first time in his life told Julian off which was great. What wasn't great was that he yelled at me in front of everyone for acting inappropriately and how I was intentionally misunderstanding what he meant by being nicer to Julian. I feel like I'm in a no win situation here since everything I do seems to be wrong and even my brother's fianc√©e agrees with me.
