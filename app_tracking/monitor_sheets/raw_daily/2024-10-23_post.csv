Now i donâ€™t want to disclose my age but just know i am under 18, so last year I made friends with a group 4 girls and in the beginning I had so much fun now Iâ€™m trans man and had came out not to long ago so was still figuring out my identity but I felt the most me I have ever with them but out of no where they started to ghost me they started moving away from me when I tried to go near them and just ignoring me in general I had no idea why they were ignoring me and started dissecting everything I said thinking I did something wrong then a few months later I was talking to one of our mutual friends who Iâ€™ll call Maria Maria was talking about maybe hanging out me her and salie (fake name one of the girls in the friend group I told her that for some reason we werenâ€™t friends anymore and how I didnâ€™t know why so she offered to ask salie for me the next period she comes to me visually upset and I ask what she said apparently salie told her that I was r@cist and how I talked shit about Maria behind her back witch I know wasnâ€™t true I normally donâ€™t like confrontation but I had salie in my next class and I had to say something so thatâ€™s what I did I did not yell or insult her or anything like that and this is what she told me she told me that one of the friends Vivian (fake name) told her I said that white people arenâ€™t as important as black people now she said she didnt hear me say but the thing is I donâ€™t remember saying it and Iâ€™ve had probably like 5 conversations with Vivian alone and it was all in passing because she didnâ€™t really like me for some reason also if I did say it I probably meant white people didnâ€™t need as much protection as black people salie than goes on about white r@cism and how she experienced it now Iâ€™m white so I donâ€™t really know but Iâ€™ve been told by my black friends that Iâ€™m not r@sist but I need to know am I the asshole?
