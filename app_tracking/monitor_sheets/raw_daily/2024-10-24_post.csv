0,1gbcyf8,AITA For asking for privacy in my own bedroom?,"I'm 19(FtM) Still living with my grandparents who have raised me since i was born. I just started paying rent for them (About $30 a month due to having difficulties finding a job around where I live without requirements of needing a car or multiple years of experience in, and jobs being difficult to find due to my own mental health issues and disabilities that make it harder to even keep a job), I thought with paying room and board I'd start getting my own privacy with my room after being told unless I started paying them something I'd never get any privacy back when I was 16.

I was asked why I haven't visited any family in a while for more then a afternoon visit, as I had told them that ""It's because I don't like that you go through my room every time I'm gone for more then 13 hours. It makes me feel like I have no privacy.""  They claim that if I want any sort of privacy I have to pay them $2,200 a month which would only give me my privacy while living with them and threatened to raise the rent if I tried fighting with them. I tried asking them about what's the point of me paying room and board then if I can't even just have some privacy and security that they wouldn't be in my room when I'm gone for 1 weekend.

They tell me to pack up and leave if I don't like the rules, which yes is understandable as that's normally how renting works, but I can't really move right now due to housing prices in my area and the uncertainty of jobs. I'm also saving up for my surgery right now which has been a struggle for me due to my slow income of art commissions as of right now. With how little I make and how much I have to pay to my grandparents and subscription services to keep my commissions going (Live 2D being my most expensive to keep) on top of my own food It's hard for me to even save the money to move.

Am I really the asshole here for asking for something I think should just be a given and not have to pay over $1k to have especially as an adult?

I apologize if this is all over the place writing is not my strong suit I've asked my dads side of family about this and even they agree that I should have a right to the privacy of my own room.

Edit: I understand $30/month is not a lot, If I could pay more monthly I would 100%, I already pay for any of my own expenses (Phone bills, subscriptions, food, clothes, hygienic products, etc) ",POO Mode Activated üí©,2024-10-24,"AITA For asking for privacy in my own bedroom?

9,1gb8xg9,AITA for having my younger sister banned from certain parties and a club?,"I (24F) recently found out that my younger sister (20F) was partying with my ex and his friends. They‚Äôre not good people which is something I found out the hard way and I don‚Äôt want my sister to end up in a bad situation so I tried to explain to her why she should stop going to these parties but she wouldn‚Äôt listen to me. So I did the only thing I could, I made a deal with my ex to get him to have her banned from these parties and the club they mostly spend time at (it's owned by his family). It‚Äôs not something I wanted to do for multiple reasons but my sister‚Äôs wellbeing is more important to me.

She found out last weekend the hard way by being refused entry to a party. I know she caused a huge scene there because it was filmed and my ex sent it to me as proof he kept his end of the deal. She knows I‚Äôm behind her suddenly being blacklisted and she hates me for it. She thinks because she‚Äôs over 18 that she should be allowed to make her own decisions but both of our parents agree with me as they know more about my ex and that crowd than my sister does. She‚Äôs said some other hurtful things to me and she‚Äôs even gone as far as begging my ex in person to unban her which was also filmed and sent to me.

11,1gb8dh6,AITA for asking my brothers girlfriend and her mother to move out of my apartment?,"Throwaway for obv reasons.

Me (31m) and my brother (28m) have an apartment together. His girlfriend (27f) and her mother (60f) needed to stay for a few months to get their financial situation together. They were only supposed to stay for 3 months, but now its been 6 months.

His girlfriend has stepped on my toes several times since living her. She's invited her sister (23F who has a kid who she doesn't know who the father is, and she's stolen from her family several times) over without my permission, and tried to get her to stay with us for a week. I told her no and ever since then she's been acting distant toward me.

Her mother already has a new boyfriend and he has an apartment, but still her materials take up a lot of space in our apartment. My living room looks like a storage unit now.

I've been getting several noise complaints from my downstairs neighbors, she stomps loudly and she's loud vocally early in the morning. We have extremely thin flooring/walls and I've asked her several times to stop stomping when she walks, and to be quieter in the morning. She does this 2 hours before I have to wake up for work, and throughout the day. She catches and attitude and still does it, and my younger brother doesn't do anything about it. Neither her or her mother cleans after themselves in the kitchen or the trash.

Even when I try to say hi, she just says hi and runs off into the room her and her mother stay in. She doesn't speak to me at all, and it feels like there is tension in my apartment.

We had a child together a year ago and currently have another on the way. We‚Äôve talked about marriage and it‚Äôs something we both want desperately but we both agreed it would be best to wait till we were finally stable enough to do so. We agreed that 4 years was enough time for us get our savings together for marriage. Now a couple weeks ago my mother in law went on her 5th year anniversary and her now fianc√© proposed to her. She obviously said yes and they wasn‚Äôt no time to start wedding planning. The wedding is in march of 2026. Now my mother in law loves my daughter with all of her heart. She‚Äôs her first born grandchild. And all of her children are way over the age to be a flower girl or boy. When she got back from her anniversary trip she told us all about the proposal and said how my daughter was going to be her flower girl. That kind of struck a nerve with me considering most people ask permission for those kind of things and not to mention that their wedding is the within the 4 year mark me and my boyfriend agreed to wait until we get married. Basically what I‚Äôm trying to say is, I don‚Äôt want my child to be in someone else‚Äôs wedding before her own parents. Mind you this is something I was excited about when I found out I was even pregnant in the first place. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish of me, but i just don‚Äôt want that first motherly experience stolen from me because I‚Äôll never get it back. I‚Äôve talked about this with my boyfriend and he seems to think I‚Äôm overthinking things. He feels that even if she‚Äôs the flower girl for his mother, it won‚Äôt take away from her being our flower girl. But that‚Äôs just not how I see things. We got into a bid disagreement about it and he told me that if i didn‚Äôt want my daughter to be the flower girl for my mother in law, I would have to tell her now. I feel as though i don‚Äôt have to tell her anything considering she just assumed I would be ok with it. I plan on only getting married once in my lifetime and I‚Äôd like for both of my children to be my flower girls considering they won‚Äôt be of age to be bridesmaids.





Update: after reading the comments and replies I want to clear some things up.
 
1. I‚Äôm financially stable enough to take care of my children(who weren‚Äôt planned) I‚Äôm just not in the position to drop a bag on a wedding rn. Which is why we agreed to save for it first.

2. A lot of people think I‚Äôm jealous of my boyfriend‚Äôs mother because she‚Äôs getting married before me, which isn‚Äôt the case. I‚Äôm very happy for her and i wish her the best in her marriage. She deserves to be happy. Me not getting married and having to wait has nothing to do with this situation, well it doesn‚Äôt but not for jealousy reasons.

3. My boyfriend does have a say in what his children can and can‚Äôt do, he just really doesn‚Äôt want to get caught in the middle of this. He‚Äôs a peacemaker.

4. My boyfriend‚Äôs mother has done some really shady stuff to me in the beginning of our relationship, i assumed it was because she didn‚Äôt like me to begin with. And after i had her grandchild our relationship got better but she still acted funny towards me sometimes. I‚Äôm not gonna go into details about what she‚Äôs done but just know it got so bad that me and my boyfriend decided it was best for her to not be around my child for a while. I was also debating on whether or not i wanted her to be in my unborn child life. Dispite all of that I was the one who decided to be the bigger person to rebuild our relationship for the sake of my relationship with her son and her relationship with her grandchild. Part of me still holds a little animosity towards the things she said and did in the past and maybe that‚Äôs why i feel it‚Äôs weird of her to just assume I‚Äôd let her do something with my child without my permission 

5. I agree that I‚Äôm very young minded and it‚Äôs wrong of me to think of this situation the way i do. I‚Äôll have a talk with my MIL about the wedding.

15,1gb7fva,WIBTA if I refused to financially support my abusive father who needs to provide for his other children?,"I, 20 y/o, have been financially supporting my family ever since I got a job at 18. I get an apprentice wage (1.300‚Ç¨, used to be 1.000‚Ç¨) and 250‚Ç¨ child benefit (I don't know if that's the correct term), a good amount of that money is spent on rent (350‚Ç¨). 
Since I don't cook by myself and have usually eaten at my parents' place (we live in the same house, for context), I have paid an additional 200‚Ç¨ for food and electricity costs etc. to them every month.

Additionally, my father tends to ask for money near the end of each month. It's between 100‚Ç¨ and 300‚Ç¨, it always depends. My parents both can't work, my father is disabled and sick and my mother is sick and doesn't have a job besides caring for my father.

Additionally, he tends to ask me to pay the weekly groceries, which is ~100‚Ç¨ per week, likely more.

So. I get 1.300‚Ç¨ (substracted estimated insurance costs already), I pay ~950‚Ç¨ for rent and to my parents. 

He usually pays me back at the beginning of the next month (for groceries he tends to do it quicker). At least he tries to. 

Even if I get it back, it's still gone for the moment and therefore an expense in my book. So I have ~350‚Ç¨ to live. Up to now, that was enough.

I won't be receiving the same wage anymore, starting this month, because I am on sick leave due to my mental health. I calculated it and I probably will get less than 1.000‚Ç¨ in total (child benefit included, insurance already substracted). Which means, if I pay the same amount of money to my parents, and keep borrowing my father money when he needs it, I'll have nothing left.

And it's not like he only pays groceries from the money I give him. He buys tons of alcohol and cigarettes too. He'd need way less money if he didn't buy all that. I'm not mentally strong enough to tell him that I'll pay for regular groceries but not for that stuff. I thought about that already but I can't handle the reaction.

Today's the first day on which I refused to pay any of his stuff, at all. It's the end of the month, obviously he needs the money. He already owes me some, and he'd owe me even more then. 

Yet I can't feel good about setting this boundary. Because there are kids in that household, who need to get their food and water etc., and especially my youngest sister is incredibly picky about food due to likely being autistic and will refuse to eat due to sensory issues. 
My other sibling is chronically ill and is refused medication because ""it's too expensive"". She has asked me to buy her food before because she can't eat too many things without getting sick, and my parents don't have the money for that. 

This family relies on me for money and I feel bad setting my boundary here. I am planning on withdrawing all of my financial support in order to get rid of those that depend on me so I can move out. Because, quite frankly, I can't stay here. I'm being emotionally and mentally (and probably also financially) abused on a daily.

Additionally, he tends to ask me to pay the weekly groceries, which is ~100‚Ç¨ per week, likely more.

So. I get 1.300‚Ç¨ (substracted estimated insurance costs already), I pay ~950‚Ç¨ for rent and to my parents. 

He usually pays me back at the beginning of the next month (for groceries he tends to do it quicker). At least he tries to. 

Even if I get it back, it's still gone for the moment and therefore an expense in my book. So I have ~350‚Ç¨ to live. Up to now, that was enough.

I won't be receiving the same wage anymore, starting this month, because I am on sick leave due to my mental health. I calculated it and I probably will get less than 1.000‚Ç¨ in total (child benefit included, insurance already substracted). Which means, if I pay the same amount of money to my parents, and keep borrowing my father money when he needs it, I'll have nothing left.

And it's not like he only pays groceries from the money I give him. He buys tons of alcohol and cigarettes too. He'd need way less money if he didn't buy all that. I'm not mentally strong enough to tell him that I'll pay for regular groceries but not for that stuff. I thought about that already but I can't handle the reaction.

Today's the first day on which I refused to pay any of his stuff, at all. It's the end of the month, obviously he needs the money. He already owes me some, and he'd owe me even more then. 

Yet I can't feel good about setting this boundary. Because there are kids in that household, who need to get their food and water etc., and especially my youngest sister is incredibly picky about food due to likely being autistic and will refuse to eat due to sensory issues. 
My other sibling is chronically ill and is refused medication because ""it's too expensive"". She has asked me to buy her food before because she can't eat too many things without getting sick, and my parents don't have the money for that. 

This family relies on me for money and I feel bad setting my boundary here. I am planning on withdrawing all of my financial support in order to get rid of those that depend on me so I can move out. Because, quite frankly, I can't stay here. I'm being emotionally and mentally (and probably also financially) abused on a daily. 

If there weren't kids involved, I'd have withdrawn my support already.",0.0,-0.0065056114,0,1

because of this, when i was younger (9) i wanted to cheer her up by bringing her favorite dolls to her. i was pretty young so i didnt realize this was kinda stupid, but i lived fairly close to the hospital so i biked there with the dolls to bring her them.

i dont remember much since i was pretty little, but i do remember that i messed them up a lot doing that (i fell in some mud and was holding them by their hair after i got off my bike) and when i brought them to her she looked like she wanted to cry

so when recently my sister had them out and i saw how damaged they were, so i decided to buy her some new ones to replace them. to make sure i got the perfect ones, i even brought our childhood friend t (16m) to help me shop

but after i brought them home and switched out the dolls she got really upset with me?? i told her i got some dolls to replace her old messed up ones and she called me stupid before leaving the house

i hate arguing with my sister shes one of my favorite people, aita? i just want to fix this

update : thanks everyone for all the responses! before i update i want to respond to something everyone was kinda worried about. i did not throw away the old dolls. even if i wanted to, i couldnt. nor did my sister think i did. i didnt realize how important they were to me too until this all happened.

apparently when i thought she was upset and crying over me ruining her dolls by taking them to the hospital, she was actually crying because it made her really happy. its kinda funny now lol cus ive always been so upset with myself for being a bad brother in that moment but apparently she was thinking the exact opposite.

20,1gb6xlb,AITA/I'm concerned about my Husband and I's marriage due to personal schedules,"Hi! 28F here - I recently got into an argument with my husband over a new routine he's planning on incorporating. Both my husband and I work demanding full-time jobs and mostly see each other on the weekends. We take lunch together (we meet halfway as both our jobs are relatively near to each other's) whenever he doesn't have meetings and whenever I'm not caught up in my daily tasks.

Our relationship is just like any other I assume - We have a routine down where we come home, I cook meal prep for the week, I clean our apartment up a bit, I go work out and he goes to a nearby park to run. We come back home around the same time, shower, catch each other up on our days and go to sleep. On the weekends, either one of us is usually tired or exhausted from the constant pressure of our jobs, but we always aim to have quality time by going out to restaurants, sight-seeing around the city, going to the movies etc. We argue and bicker like any other couple, and we've also recently had a situation happen where we've been contemplating divorcing, but we decided to stay strong and work through the problem - This low point is where I believe the fear is coming from.

Now in the 5 years we've been together, we both have let ourselves go a few times, yet we also seem to bounce back. We both try to eat as clean as possible with the occasional cheat meal and we both stay active whether that be at our apartment gym or the nearby park. He decided to join his friend at a new gym to learn how to weightlift and I genuinely applaud him for bettering himself. However, the gym he goes to is pretty far and there's a lot of traffic going back home.

All in all, he was gone for 3 hours with him coming home pretty late. I did not get to see him at all even after cooking, working out and tidying up. He mentioned how he plans on this being his new routine, and the possibility of me not seeing him at least once during the week other than him just coming home to sleep didn't sit right with me. I reiterated that the problem isn't him not taking control of his life, but more so the fact that I don't want to be in a marriage where I only seem him during the weekends (and that's if he's not too tired after a long week to have proper quality time during the weekends). He mentioned how he always feels like he's living his life for others, how I always make it about me or our relationship and that he can't do anything for himself, but that's simply not true. We both have alone time whenever we need it, I tried compromising with him that maybe he could try M-W-F each week so he doesn't miss out on the opportunity to better himself while going somewhere more near to be active on the ""off days"", but he is not willing to understand where I come from. Even reading this back to myself, I feel like I'm the nagging wife, but I genuinely don't like the things he threw at me or the way he belittled the argument to add backup to his case.

23,1gb6k2e,AITA for asking to sit in my reserved train seat when other people's trains have been cancelled.,"I (26f) live in the UK and use trains a few times a year to travel to see family and friends. This situation has happened twice now and I'm not sure if it's me who is thinking wrongly about this or not so I would really appreciate reddit's perspective.

Unfortunately trains in the UK are quite often cancelled or delayed, leading to later trains having more passengers than seats available.

I have a physical disability and struggle to stand or lean for long periods of time so I always make sure to book train seats where I can.

Twice now I've had an experience where my train arrived as planned but previous trains on that route had been cancelled. As a result the trains were then packed with passengers.

I went to my reserved seat and politely asked the person sitting in the seat if they would move so that I could sit. They refused saying that they had had this seat reserved on the previous train which was cancelled. I questioned this saying that if their train had been cancelled then I would have thought their reservation no longer applied. And that my train and my reservation had not been cancelled so I should get to sit in the seat I paid for. However they still refused saying that as the previous train had been cancelled and as all those passengers were now getting this train my reservation no longer applied. I did my best to be polite and I didn't mention my disability to them as I didn't want to make a big drama, I just reluctantly accepted it. But it has been really bothering me.

I don't know if this is just some aspect of train etiquette I'm unaware of? It just seems unfair to me, as I feel sorry for them that their train was cancelled but I don't see why it should affect my seat reservation. My partner agrees with me but we are both autistic and tend to think quite literally about rules so I'm aware we could be wrong.

So am I the arsehole for expecting to be able to sit in my reserved seat when other passengers' previous train was cancelled?



Edit for info requested:

  
I was on the train for over an hour and there were no announcements saying all reservations were cancelled and nothing indicated mine would not be valid. 

It was a very packed train with 9 carriages and I did not know where the conductor would be. If there was one nearby I would have considered asking them to intervene but I didn't want to try to cram my way through multiple crowded carriages to find one. 

Also I'm not going to lie, I'm quite conflict averse. A few people have said that I should have stood up for myself more and got a train conductor involved.  I can see that asking someone to move but not being willing to back that up with the train conductor is a bit arseholey potentially. I have an invisible disability and am young and am often afraid people will not believe me if I say I am disabled and I just really don't want to deal with that situation which is why I didn't say anything. And regarding the conductor I really don't like making a fuss and I was hoping that just me asking would be enough for them to be kind and decent people and I didn't want it to escalate. But I see that that's potentially soething I need to work on. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-24,"AITA for asking to sit in my reserved train seat when other people's trains have been cancelled.

However they still refused saying that as the previous train had been cancelled and as all those passengers were now getting this train my reservation no longer applied. I did my best to be polite and I didn't mention my disability to them as I didn't want to make a big drama, I just reluctantly accepted it. But it has been really bothering me.

I don't know if this is just some aspect of train etiquette I'm unaware of? It just seems unfair to me, as I feel sorry for them that their train was cancelled but I don't see why it should affect my seat reservation. My partner agrees with me but we are both autistic and tend to think quite literally about rules so I'm aware we could be wrong.

So am I the arsehole for expecting to be able to sit in my reserved seat when other passengers' previous train was cancelled?



Edit for info requested:

  
I was on the train for over an hour and there were no announcements saying all reservations were cancelled and nothing indicated mine would not be valid. 

It was a very packed train with 9 carriages and I did not know where the conductor would be. If there was one nearby I would have considered asking them to intervene but I didn't want to try to cram my way through multiple crowded carriages to find one. 

Also I'm not going to lie, I'm quite conflict averse. A few people have said that I should have stood up for myself more and got a train conductor involved.  I can see that asking someone to move but not being willing to back that up with the train conductor is a bit arseholey potentially. I have an invisible disability and am young and am often afraid people will not believe me if I say I am disabled and I just really don't want to deal with that situation which is why I didn't say anything. And regarding the conductor I really don't like making a fuss and I was hoping that just me asking would be enough for them to be kind and decent people and I didn't want it to escalate. But I see that that's potentially soething I need to work on. ",0.0,0.0021166133,0,1

I (19F) have a close friend who recently started dating this guy, and at first, everything seemed fine. But lately, it‚Äôs become super uncomfortable to be around them.

It doesn‚Äôt stop at food. He tells her what to wear, how to spend her time, even what she should be studying because he thinks her degree is ""useless."" I was shocked, but she never pushes back. It‚Äôs like she‚Äôs slowly letting him control every aspect of her life.

Last weekend, we were hanging out, and he made another comment about how she‚Äôs ""lucky to have someone who‚Äôs keeping her in check."" I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and told him to stop treating her like a child. He got really angry, accused me of being disrespectful and said I was trying to ""ruin their relationship."" Then he went off about how ""women need guidance,"" and my friend just sat there, quiet.

28,1gb5gr8,Update- AITA for snapping at my sister that she'll choke on her jealousy one day?,"Hi guys! 
It's been around a month or so and tbh I don't have that much of an update but a lot of people have been asking me about the doggie and it's easier than telling people individually so here it is!

First things first, the update on my siblings situation- My brother and SIL have gone LC with my sister until they get a proper apology, which hasn't happened yet but I think it will happen soon? My sister has been talking to my mom about wanting to be in our future nephew/niece's life so there's that at least.

Also, my SIL is officially out of her first trimester and she and the baby are healthy and thriving thankfully!She has been having a bit of a hard time when it comes to smells and pregnancy stuff but I think that's to be expected. (Don't come at me, just from what I've read)
We've also been planning a gender reveal party for next month so we're just focusing on the positive stuff for now.

As for my sister and I, I did send her an apology for how harsh I was with her at the party and she accepted it and apologized for calling me a bitch but it's been so damn weird when it comes to our dynamic, especially since she's suddenly all up in my business about who I'm sleeping with- but that's another issue.

Now for the awaited update- Barkley.
Turns out the big fluffball has an adorable bark, one you wouldn't expect when seeing him, hence his name.

As some of you predicted, my sister was not up for the massive job that is taking care of a St.Bernard and a week and a half after the party, she called and asked me to find him another home (I volunteer at a shelter and know a lot of people who would love to adopt) 

I honestly wanted to keep him myself because I've grown attached but I live in an apartment rn and not only would it be impossible, it would also be cruel to keep him cooped up like that.
Luckily, a friend of a friend has the space for him to be happy and safe and took him in with the promise of letting me see him whenever we're both free and now I get random pics and videos of Barkley in his element all happy and bark fighting with the guy's next door neighbor's Yorkie (don't worry, there's fences between them)

Sooo yeah, just wanted to say thank you guys for all the advice and opinions, I appreciate all of you ü´∞üèº

I've not been on good terms with his parents (Amongst other things, they asked me not to apply for child maintenance etc., as their boy cannot afford it, and so on, so you could say we're not the best of friends).

Recently, during child drop off, my ex's mother got very upset about the concert mumbo-jumbo and started telling me off for making my ex pay child support I just waste on myself and so on.

When she stopped ranting, and I stopped giggling, I told her, that her son's child support wouldn't even cover the travel cost of the trip, and they can rest assured that I don't live off of his child support given, that I wouldn't be able to raise my child on that amount, let alone the both of us.

She called me a liar and stormed off.

Now their whole family are upset with me, saying that I was rude and they expect apologies. I was also told that I was an asshole for telling them how much I actually receive as it's put my ex in a bad light.

So, the idea is to sell the apartment and split the money between me and my brother, as my father once intended. Currently, he is showing more and more signs of second guessing the decision to leave the money to us, instead claiming that he also should have a third split of the money, while also dictating the ""rules"" on what we will do with our share.

So, now that you have some context on the current situation, let me explain what happened this week. I got a notice from the neighbour below that there was water dripping from my apartment to theirs, since for me it was a rough month and I currently have almost no money left, I talked to them and explained that I couldn't afford a plumber right now, but was sure the issue was my washing tank or my laundry machine, based on where the dripping was happening, and so they agreed to wait while I promised to not use any of those things in this period.

So, here comes my father, that already knows about the issue because the neighbour also contacted him (they know I'm his son), but I explained the situation and said that I would wait a little bit until I got the money, but he offered to pay for the plumber since it is a problem with the apartment itself, I agreed.

Fast forward to today, the plumber showed up in the middle of my worktime as I work from home, he explained that was here for the dripping problem so I let him in knowing my father probably sent him but forgot to warn me. After he is done, he exists the apartment and then I get bombarded with messages from my father claiming that he will not pay for the plumber since the issue was caused by, in his words, irresponsibility (the problem was the washing tank was clogged). He said that I should know that the washing tank should only be used with water and only water. I let him know that HE was the one that sent the plumber and offered to pay the bill even when I was willing to pay if he would just wait a bit.

So, here's where I might be the asshole: I refused to pay and said that he was not a man of his word if he said he would pay and now isn't. I even said for him to try to not lie the next time, and this got him angry, so angry he sweared at me and called me a son of a b*tch and told me to go f myself.

Now, he and my brother are saying that I overreacted and could have chosen different words to not offend him this much.

My wife and I have 3 children under 8 which can make getting away to see friends difficult. We have an online (and paper) calendar. The general rule is if we agree it's fine to go away it goes in the calendar and its locked in

This week on Tuesday my Wife said she would be going to somewhere two hours away for a friends birthday, leaving Friday, back on Sunday. 

The event is not in either calendar but I do recall my wife mentioning it and in principle agreeing that it was fine for her to go to the birthday. 

The complication is we just started potty training our two year old. We are 4 days in and it is quite intense, it means following the 2 year old round with a potty and constantly watching them. We can't take him out anywhere for at least the next week as he has too many accidents and is too unreliable. I told her that I didn't think it was reasonable to go away for two nights at short notice during potty training. The two older kids have sports clubs and swimming which they will not be able to go to on Saturday if I'm on my own. 

I suggested as a compromise my wife just leave at midday on Saturday and return Sunday afternoon. She does not want to do this. She has argued that I am capable of looking after the three of them on my own or to get a babysitter for Saturday morning.

It may be possible to get a babysitter at late notice but it's not something I want to do as I am then committing to coming/going certain times and having somebody in the house when I may not necessarily want them there.

I've decided to make this post in order to get other views on this matter that might help me see the ""big picture"". I apologise in advance if my English is not perfect, it's not my mother tongue.
So, here's what's happening :my grandma has been ill for the past 6 months and we all hoped she would recover (she's not that old and was in great shape before that). Unfortunately she was more and more tired lately and I just learned this week that the doctors decided she had to go to palliative care. 
She's not anymore returning my phone calls or messages because she's too tired, so all the info I get are from my relatives who live near her hospital.

I (29 F) live with my boyfriend (29M) at more or less 4h hours by train from the city where she is,and we were already planning to go there at the end of next week for another reason.
The thing is, her condition is getting worse and I'm not sure she will still be conscious next week. So I decided to go see her now. I was close to her, and my boyfriend of almost 3 years knows her too (he saw her more than his own grandparents these years). He said to me he didn't want to go because he was already coming to this city next week. He said the only reason he would consider coming is if I ask him to be there for me.
As I currently do feel in the need of support I said I would appreciate his presence. But he showed me he really did not want to come and I felt it was really inappropriate to force him on such a serious situation, that the only fact that I would have to beg him doesn't suit the importance of the situation.
So, for now he's not coming and I'm angry at him, even more I'm thinking maybe I should reconsider our relationship if he's not able to show up for me when I ask him and it feels really weird to go alone.

He also made me feel guilty (and regretted it right after) of reconsidering coming to a concert that we have planned this week. So, he's not planning on coming but I should respect my engagement even though the situation is bigger than that.

So, should I insist on wanting him there, considering the fact that it's expensive and that it takes a lot of time, or should I let it go and hope I will forgive him ? Also, he's a bit angry at me for putting him in this position, so AITA? 

Sorry for this long post, I hope it was as precise as possible and that you might make me understand better his point of view. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-24,"AITA for wanting my boyfriend to come with me visit my dying grandmother  Hello everyone,

41,1gb1jd0,"AITAH, Am I the asshole? ","I female (18) sold my laptop to this other girl at my varsity when  hers broke down. I knew her friend and the friend vouched for this girl so I had no problem with giving it to her for a much later payment( this payment was supposed to be by August 30th). This whole thing happened around the beginning of August. Unfortunately a few weeks later ( around when she was meant to pay me) she got mugged and lost the laptop. Me being me I understood that she went through this situation and she won‚Äôt be able to pay me back all my money. 
Then came another day ( somewhere around the beginning of September) she borrowed my laptop ( the one I was using at that time) to use for a day. Again, I showed her kindness and I did. Problem is she got mugged again that very same day while trying to bring my laptop back to me. My laptop is worth quite a hefty amount in my country ( not from the US) and combined with the first laptop ( she hasn‚Äôt payed for it yet) it should be close to US$2000, which again is a lot of money in my country. 

I knew that being mugged twice wasn‚Äôt a very nice thing and I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on anyone so I gave her leniency. Just asked her to send me the total cost of the money and I could just get my own laptop but she said her parents offered to buy the laptops ( her new one and mine) on a contract. I was reluctant but I agreed. It has been close to 3 months now I‚Äôm still without that laptop that was meant to have been baught. At first she told me that her parents couldn‚Äôt afford to ship it out to my country ( she‚Äôs an international student) from hers. Again I understood and just told her she should let me know as soon they are able to. She told me I should chip in to pay for the custom duties, which is like the tax to ship and stuff ( which I didn‚Äôt get since I wasn‚Äôt the one who said they should buy it outside the country and surely I wasn‚Äôt paying for something that was owed to me). I kept quiet.

I saw her again on campus and asked her what‚Äôs going and she told me her parents are shipping the things now but when I sent her an email about what‚Äôs happening she didn‚Äôt reply. It‚Äôs been a week and I haven‚Äôt heard anything from her. I‚Äôm beginning to worry ( very high key stressed over what‚Äôs going on and I have exams plus I need the money from the other laptop to pay for my bus to keg back home since I study very far from home). 
I threatened to open a case against her for fraud ( don‚Äôt know what I was even thinking when I told her this) if she didn‚Äôt reply by the end of the day. Now I just think I‚Äôm being unfair on her since she did get robbed twice and it‚Äôs not in her control what her parents can afford at the time. I am wrong for wanting my things back?

We broke up before she was born because our relationship was toxic. Even though we aren‚Äôt together, I‚Äôve been doing everything I can to support our daughter and stay involved in her life.

I make about $4,500 a month, and while I don‚Äôt pay official child support, I give my ex at least $1,000 a month to help with baby expenses. I also buy diapers, clothes, and formula. The thing is, my ex lives with her parents, and they pay for pretty much everything related to the baby, like housing, food, and utilities, so she doesn‚Äôt have a lot of expenses herself. Meanwhile, I live on my own and cover all my bills rent, utilities, groceries, etc. I‚Äôm also trying to save for our daughter‚Äôs future.

Recently, my ex has been asking for more money, saying raising a baby is expensive (which I get), but I feel like I‚Äôm already doing my part. On top of the money, I make sure to spend at least three hours a day with my daughter, even though I work full-time and only have Sundays off.

Now, my ex is saying I‚Äôm not stepping up as a dad because I won‚Äôt give her more money and because I don‚Äôt spend enough time with our daughter. But I feel like I‚Äôm already doing everything I can, especially considering her parents cover most of the baby‚Äôs costs.

43,1gb1b6p,AITA for refusing to babysit for my sister when even my parents are pushing me to say yes?,"My older sister (20f) had a baby with her husband a month ago. I (16m) haven't actually met her son yet and maybe I won't ever and that'd be fine by me but even still, she (and my parents) want me to babysit right after school until 11pm each night so my sister's husband can work and my sister can do whatever it is she does for a few hours. I wanna say she's working also but I don't know if she is.

I have a part time job I'd need to quit if I did say yes. Not to mention my sister and I are not close, she's a mean girl with a cruel streak that I was exposed to a lot growing up and even after she moved out. Our parents think she can't do anything wrong and they're so proud of her for getting married and having a kid by 20. They think it's the way we should all want our lives to work out.

Did I mention my sister wanted me to change my name because she wanted to name her son Theo but didn't want to name him after me? That's how much she dislikes me and how entitled she is. She went with a different name because I refused but she called me a waste of oxygen because she didn't get to take Theo off me as a name.

I was first asked/told I needed to babysit a week ago and when I said no she went to our parents who agreed with her that it should be me. They told me I should think of it as getting time with my nephew and how good it will be. I asked her if their daughter feels the same way about it and they said of course. So I asked why it was made perfectly clear I wasn't allowed to come meet him with the rest of the family. They told me it's because I'm in school and he was a newborn.

My sister told me her son will be told I'm not an uncle and I'm just the babysitter. She said she doesn't want people to know we're related and doesn't really want me with her kid but she won't have to pay me, and our parents will make sure I don't do anything dumb like demand money for it. I told her I wouldn't quit my job to watch her kid and she told me I will if she keeps crying to our parents because they will march over there and say I quit and then make me go to her house every day after school.

My parents threated to do that but I told them then I'd still say no and I wouldn't have my own money to spend which would annoy them. But they keep putting pressure on me and my sister is calling me a wasted life for not submitting to what she wants and she told me I'm a pathetic, useless little boy who was a mistake from conception.

44,1gb14ct,AITA for sleeping while babysitting my cousin‚Äôs 5yo?,"I (23F) just had a pretty bad week which resulted in loss of sleep. My cousin (36F) and her husband (39M) as well as their daughter (5F) are visiting our family and staying at our house.


My cousin has been living in the US for over 11 years and for a few reasons, as well as the pandemic, it‚Äôs been quite a few years since she last visited. My cousin misses our country quite a lot and is determined to make the most of their time here. We have been going out together quite a lot the last 4 days, and my cousin‚Äôs joy has unfortunately suffered a bit because of her daughter. The kid is not bad by any means, but she is in a strange place with strange people so she is a bit clingy.


Today, my cousin wants to go out to shop for some clothes and I offered to look after her kid so she can go out with her husband and get some alone time. Her husband was a bit concerned before they went out, which fair, he didn‚Äôt know me well at all. My cousin convinced him and they left me in charge of the girl.


I have experiences dealing with children, so I am not too concerned. We watch a movie, I made her lunch and she enjoyed playing the board game I taught her. Unfortunately, I usually take a nap at noon, as most people in my country, and I were already running low on sleep this week so I handed the kid some toddler markers (the erasable ones) and let her draw on my face and arms and legs. I told her as long as she didn‚Äôt draw on my clothes, she was fine. 

The kid loves it. So while I took a nap, she drew on my skin, if she stopped, I opened my eyes to check. It‚Äôs not like I got a deep sleep, just a nap that allowed me some energy to not crash during the evening. Everything was good until my cousin and her husband came home. I heard they opened the gate but didn‚Äôt came out. Shortly after, my cousin‚Äôs husband barged in, literally shoved the door open and everything and saw me half asleep with the girl drawing princess on my leg. 

He proceeded to yell at me and accused me of being irresponsible. He said they shouldn‚Äôt have trusted me with the little girl. I tried to explain but he didn‚Äôt budge. My cousin is firmly on the stance that he was being ridiculous but then he accused both of us as AH. My cousin for not siding with him, and me over being careless with the kid.

AITA? My parents are saying that I should‚Äôve stay awake anyway because kids that age are fast. But my dad was literally in the room beside us and he would have noticed if she even open the door. 

Tldr: cousin‚Äôs husband walked in while I was asleep looking after his daughter and accused me of being the irresponsible AH. I believe I am not because the kid was drawing on my skin and I would have noticed if she even stop for a moment.

The prize was a fire pit, a $50 gift certificate to an Italian restaurant, a $10 gift card to a florist, 2 Halloween themed plush blankets, a nice scented candle, a picture frame, and a box of hot chocolate. 


The kids and I can enjoy an evening roasting marshmallows over the fire pit. They each got a cute blanket. We all enjoy hot chocolate. The Italian restaurant has a kids menu, so the three of us can go one night. Overall, it's a prize that I can enjoy with my kids.

47,1gb0x5j,AITA for refusing to go to a small party for my half sister after already going to the bigger one?,"My half sister (27f) finished her education and got her masters degree recently. To celebrate there was a party with all of her friends and family to celebrate. This meant her maternal side, our shared paternal side and all her friends. During the party she was asked to make a speech and for a part of her speech she talked about how she hoped her mom would be proud, how sad she was to not have her mom and how growing up without a mom really made her fight for the life she wanted because she realized how soon a life can end and how her mom was one of her biggest, if not the biggest, inspiration in her life.

My mom has been her stepmom since she was 8 and was really upset by my half sister's speech and she ended up leaving before the speech was over because of what my half sister said and my dad followed her and she was crying on the way out. My mom was hurt that after all this time my sister still felt like she grew up without any mom when she did try to fill the void her mom left behind with her death. But my half sister never called her mom. I don't ever remember hearing her refer to my parents as her parents. She'd say dad and my mom's name or she'd say parents and then mention her mom was dead. She'd say dad was remarried. But she never saw my mom like that.

So while I get my mom feeling that way my half sister has been consistent about it.

Now our shared parental side are throwing a smaller celebration for my half sister for only close family and well, even after what happened my mom and dad still plan to go and bring me (16f) and my brothers (14 and 13). I'm refusing to go after what happened this time around. Besides, my half sister isn't close to me or my brothers. She doesn't need or really want us there. I'm almost certain she doesn't want any of us there after what happened at the big party. When told I needed to be there I said I was already at the big one so I don't need to go again.

I was told if I don't go I'll be grounded and I said that's fine by me. I still have a few days to change my mind but I'm still refusing.

49,1gb0o1f,AITA when my partner blames me for moments our toddler hurts himself,"For context, I'm 33yr (M) who has a job in a company where the flexible work home arrangement policy has shifted to 2 days a week in the office (8am start and 4pm finish), whilst my partner 34yr (F) works from home remotely full time.

My partner and I have seen we fight way more than we did before our son was born. I've acknowledged this a challenge of entering parenthood but try to compartmentalise each issue we experience because over-reacting just feels dramatic.

Now that our son is a full blown toddler almost going into his ""threenager"" phase so I understand times ahead will be tough for us but I know he his still developing whilst trying to be super independent. It's something I've come feel frustrated but do love deep down.

I feel that my partner feels the same but she does have harsher reactions than me but understandly to me because she's giving 110% effort like preparing a yummy healthy snack plate only for our soon to pick out one and ask for another plate with different foods. Again the joys of toddlers.

I'm glad to say because she and I earn comfortable salaries, that we can afford him to go to daycare 4 times a week where I drop him off at 7am and either I or she will pick him at 4:30pm.

To bring this back to the subject heading, I see now though my partner will blame shift when it comes to our son getting himself hurt. 

She does it to her mom and her immediate family and me. I know she's very protective of our son but it hurts when I get blame shifted in moments that involve him hurting himself and a) I'm the closest to his location and therefore could have stopped it with flash like speed or b) guilty of having to drive back home from work with the risk of being stuck in traffic, which means she is on her own to care for him and effectively watch like a hawk.

Eventually toddlers will win at the end of the day with our son hurting himself jumping from the couch poorly and falling to his small desk, causing a bad scratch under his chin. On that day when I got home, she blamed me for not being there because I got home late at around 5:30pm and I didn't help her. Should mention comutting to and from work (either car or by train) will take on average an hour.

At the end of the day, I love my partner but I'm live these days on edge when it comes to her and my son who I know will continue to earn his bruises and scratches because that is the life of any growing child.

I got angry and told him off.He fake apologized and I refuse to let it go. ,"My (f51) best friend ""Ron""(m59), passed away suddenly 3 days ago. We have been best friends since I was 18, almost 34 years. We live in different states now, but had the kind of friendship where long distance didn't matter. Ron was always there for me, we could talk on the phone about anything for hours. He would've jumped on a plane and been there for me in a moment. 
My husband, ""Dan"" (m61), been together 24 yrs, always hated Ron. Over the years, Dan would make fun of Ron, get jealous and mad when we talked, even kicked Ron out of our house at 2am once when he visited. 
When I found out Ron died I was quietly devastated. No hysterics, I didn't really want to talk about it. Ron and I had planned to be best friends forever. He was the only person I could truly trust 100% in this world. 
My husband is literally jealous, even though Ron is no longer alive. Dan said "" Well, you wouldn't care if my mom died, so why should I care about a guy you were friends with"". Which isn't even true about his mom.  

Dan has no close friends he has kept up with for so long. Dan acts as though I should be over this in 3 days and yelled at me for being sad. He fought with me and acts extra mean. Also, we just got destroyed by Hurricane Milton. My brand new car is totaled (salt water flooded), the roof of my house is messed up and both insurance companies are trying to avoid paying. It's been a bad couple of weeks. 

I told Dan he was just jealous because Ron and I were so close. I never had any romantic thing with Ron, Ever!! We were strictly platonic friends. I also told Dan he was a poor excuse for a husband and is unempathetic, narcissistic, and possibly a psychopath. 

I am so angry and disappointed in Dan and he ""fake"" apologized, but after 24 years I know he doesn't mean it. He now is just ignoring it and trying to act like nothing happened.

It ended up being about 600 altogether. It wasn‚Äôt really for any occasion except a culmination of all our birthdays that I wanted to celebrate. So I explained it to them as a birthday gift for all of us. My birthday was a week after it and I got nothing from this friend. Which is fine!! She doesn‚Äôt owe me anything and I honestly wasn‚Äôt expecting anything. But I figured that my generosity a month ago could have at least warranted her not going back in her word about lowering the price. 


5 months ago, my friend sent me a link to a concert that was happening that she wanted to go to with me. We both talked about and liked this artist. I agreed and sent her 170 bucks for my ticket and she bought them both.

About two weeks ago she texting me and said she doesn‚Äôt want to go anymore because it‚Äôs her peak work period and she is trying to save up but that if I found someone else to go with she would sell my ticket to them at a discount. I said that was ok and a few days after that, I told her we could just sell them both because I didn‚Äôt know anyone else who was a fan and would want to go. 

She said ‚Äúhmmm maybe.‚Äù 

I replied ‚Äúwdym? Do you want to go now?‚Äù

She said ‚Äúidk leave it with me‚Äù

I waited a few more days and texted again asking if she had thought about it. She told me she hadn‚Äôt had time to think about it. 

A few days after that I asked again. At this point I had someone else I wanted to ask that I would gift the ticket to and pay for it myself. But I couldn‚Äôt ask them until I knew she wasn‚Äôt coming. She left it on read.

I texted again as soon as I saw it left on opened and she said ‚Äúyeah let‚Äôs just sell them both‚Äù.

I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to go now. I‚Äôll buy yours. How much do you want for it?‚Äù

She said ‚Äú170. That‚Äôs what we paid for them.‚Äù

I do not want to fork out the full price after she ditched the plans. I booked work off for this.

52,1gayqds,AITA for not wanting my partner to go away for 2 nights?,"My wife and I have 3 small children which can make getting away to see friends difficult.  We have an online (and paper) calendar.  The general rule is if we agree it's fine to go away it goes in the calendar and its locked in.

This week on Tuesday my Wife announced she would be going two hours away for a friends birthday, leaving Friday, back on Sunday.  The event is not in either calendar but I do recall my wife mentioning it and in principle agreeing that it was fine for her to go to the birthday.

The complication is we just started potty training our two year old.  We are 4 days in and it is quite intense, it means following the 2 year old round with a potty and constantly watching them.  We can't take him out anywhere for at least the next week as he has too many accidents and is too unreliable.

  
I told her that I didn't think it was reasonable to go away for two nights at short notice during potty training.

The two older kids have sports clubs and swimming which they will not be able to go to on Saturday if I'm on my own.  I suggested as a compromise my wife just leave at midday on Saturday and return Sunday afternoon.

She is not happy with this.   She has argued that I am capable of looking after the three of them on my own or to get a babysitter for Saturday morning.  I agree that I can look after them but it will mean two days stuck in the house and the kids will miss their clubs.  It may be possible to get a babysitter at late notice but it's not something I want to do as I am then committing to coming/going certain times and having somebody in the house when I may not necessarily want them there.

Her other argument is that originally she was going to go away the following weekend for two nights to spend time with one friend but since that friend will be at the birthday party she is already combining two weekends away into one.  

So far this year she has had approximately 10 nights away with her friends and I have had about 4, although she is generally supportive when I want to do anything socially.

This text felt like a slap in the face. After some back and forth, I suggested discussing things in person the next day. When we met, Tiana barely spoke to me, and the friend who came with me started calling me the asshole.



They claimed, ‚ÄúYou weren‚Äôt even that helpful and did what any friend would do.‚Äù While this is somewhat true, no one else stepped up the way I did. I bought additional alcohol, extra food (since the original ran out), and helped organize games to keep everyone engaged.



I was called the asshole for giving them weaker alcohol because ""even if they were drunk, they had the right to drink what they wanted."" I explained that I wouldn‚Äôt have acted this way if Tiana hadn‚Äôt been so drunk and out of control.



I understand Tiana has the right to enjoy herself, but I wish she had maintained some decorum as a host or at least delegated responsibilities to someone else.",0.0,1.0307573,1,0

55,1gawq0d,WIBTA if I attend a teambuilding on my husband's birthday?,"A bit of backstory: My husband never cared much about birthdays when we met. I on the other hand celebrate all of my birthdays and he has started doing something on his birthday sometimes since we started dating, usually only if I plan something though. If I do plan and arrange something (be that dinner or a BBQ party with our friends) he's usually appreciates and enjoys it. Sometimes he'll drop a line, like ""what should we do for my birthday?"" and then wait for me to plan something. I'm the one planning and organizing all of my own birthday parties as well as the ones for our kids too.

Now his birthday is coming up, but it coincides with a 2 day/1 night teambuilding at work (it is not compulsory, but highly encouraged for everyone to go, I would need to take leave days as well if I don't go). I thought it wouldn't be a big deal for him since he's not crazy about bd's, so I told him about it and asked whether we should plan a dinner the weekend after. He said no and that he wants me there for his birthday, which was surprising to me, but fair enough. I am in a management position at work and do think it is important for me professionally to attend the teambuilding though. I proposed to attend half of the first day and we could do dinner in the evening. Again, he vetoed this and said he wants to do a BBQ in the evening with some friends and needs me home the whole day to prepare and he could not enjoy his birthday any other way. I proposed to ask his cousins to help out with preparations and I'd join them later, but he said it will make him feel like I'm just a guest instead of his wife and is unacceptable.

Again, this is the man who has never planned anything for his birthday by himself and always went along with whatever I suggested. He has never before asked me to skip work/take leave on his birthday ever. He also never mentioned anything about his plans for this year until I brought up the teambuilding.

He has asked me last year to not attend our work teambuilding as well and generally gets grouchy when I go for events without him where other men are present. He also doesn't really like my work and thinks that I'm working too much and should be home more (It's a fulltime job, but I also cannot really scale down, because I'm the main income earner in our family and we already have a tight budget as is) and also give him more attention while I'm working. Like answer his texts quicker and pick his calls immediately (I usually decline and tell him to text me if I'm in a meeting).

Because of this history, and because I think that I've offered a reasonable compromise, I'm getting the feeling that he's either just using his birthday as a reason to make me not attend the teambuilding or that this is some kind of test to prove that he's more important to me than my work.

The tables are limited, and most students just leave their laptops or notebooks on the tables to keep them booked for hours and then mostly just come back to pick their stuff and leave because presumably their plans change. So I and most others have learned to just use the tables no matter what is kept over it. My coffee breaks take hardly 20 minutes and I mostly never even see the person who left their stuff.

58,1gawjra,AITA for expecting my mom to babysit?," Relevant info- I live nearly 3000 miles away from her, and have no family nearby other than my spouse and our two children. My firstborn was a very calm, content baby and my mother watched her once when I needed to get a haircut during a visit. My son.. is not so calm. 

 She came to visit when my son was born, and no babysitting was necessary. She came again when he was about 10 months old, and it was previously discussed that she would watch him a few times during her stay. Once, so my husband and I could have a long overdue date night, and then just an hour here or there so that my husband could give me driving lessons for my road test. (I am not used to driving a large SUV and wanted to save $500 in lessons from a school). 

During her stay, my coworker babysat the kids so that my mother, husband and I could go out for my birthday. Throughout her two week stay,  my mom watched him once for two hours (only because I had to rush my daughter to an urgent care facility). She called a few times to hurry us along because of his crying. Needless to say, she refused to watch him at all after that. Something to note- he cried more than typical, but not colic. HOWEVER, she did nothing that I think a normal person would do when a baby cries. She wouldn‚Äôt smile at him, sing a song, try to entertain him. She‚Äôd instantly scowl and just shake/rock the car seat/stroller hoping it would end. I tried to prompt her to attempt these things but she just.. wouldn‚Äôt. 

I got invited to my close friend‚Äôs wedding and am in the bridal party(I‚Äôm traveling to my mom‚Äôs state w the kids). She asked if I could help decorate the venue the day before, and I asked my mother if she‚Äôd at all be willing to watch him so I could assist for a couple of hours. Instantly refused ‚Äúhe‚Äôs gonna cry right,‚Äù ‚Äúnot all babies cry like that‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôd watch her alone‚Äù ‚ÄúI just want peace‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre doing the bipolar shit again‚Äù. (Not that it matters but I‚Äôm not bipolar or dealing with any other disorder like it). 

I ended the conversation after that, knowing it was a lost cause. I said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to listen to you berate me because I asked a question. I expected as much. Go finish your food in peace, see you soon, love you bye‚Äù 

I can totally understand that grandparents are not signing up to be a second parent and watch the kids constantly but I really am struggling to understand if what I‚Äôm asking is objectively wrong. She‚Äôs watched my son for 2 hours in his 15 months of life. Any time I‚Äôve asked her to watch him has been for reasons far from leisure (urgent care visit, driving lessons, bridal party duties). He did cry a lot with her but she also did nothing to help him, she wouldn‚Äôt even pick him up to hold him.

62,1gavpsm,AITAH for forgetting my friends birthday,"Little back story, I met this girl (23F) on the internet a couple months back and we've hangout in person about 3 times. So the day prior to her birthday was the day that one of my family friend had passed away, I didn't share this news to her as we were not that close and I didn't feel like talking to anyone at the time. The next day (the day of her birthday) it had completely slipped my mind to wish her a happy birthday as I was still grieving my other friend. Later that day, she posted that it was her birthday on social media so l wished her a happy birthday, she said thank you and I thought everything was fine. The next day I noticed that she unfollowed on all social media platforms, I was very confused because we never had any issues before. I quickly texted her asking if everything was ok as l had no idea why she would have this reaction. She texted back that she no longer wanted to be friends and it was because I didn't wish her a happy birthday before she posted it on social media. I explained to her that it wasn't my attention to forget but if that's what she wants I'm fine with it.
Honestly, I was very surprised and confused.
Personally, I wouldn't care if it was me especially because I didn't know this person for that long. So l guess I am just curious to see if other people would break a friendship over something like this and AITAH for forgetting her birthday?

I revealed this to my mom today, and she was upset and is now emphasizing focusing on school. My sisters (22F & 25F) said I was untrustworthy and an irresponsible person for not telling them earlier. One of them said I was going to close doors in my future because I am not grown up. They said because I am untrustworthy I have to be policed and checked on because I make it that way.

70,1gatlrv,AITA for charging my friend to stay in my apartment for months?,"Disclaimer: English is not my first language, so sorry for eventual mistakes.
so me and my friend A we‚Äôre friends since the first year of university, and we can consider each other‚Äôs one of the best friends. Recently she moved out from her previous apartment because her parents are not supporting her flat expenses anymore because she didn‚Äôt graduate on time and they asked her to come back home ( she lives in another city). I told her she could stay at my place, and after talking to my parents they told me to charge her not even half the price of her previous apartment, she used to pay 800‚Ç¨ for a one roomed flat without the additional expenses while I asked her 300‚Ç¨ including everything (remember the flat is my parents and they suggested this price since we‚Äôre friends). She at first agreed, now she already stayed more than a month, and when I asked her about the money she told me ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it a bit too much for just the bills?‚Äù to which I told her is not something i‚Äôm taking care of bc it‚Äôs my parents doing. Also my parent are not currently living here anymore, it‚Äôs just me and my sister but we have separate rooms. Now what i‚Äôm asking is AITA for charging her? She‚Äôs supposed to stay till December, and she moved in on September. What should I do bc she let me in a really uncomfortable situation. 


[UPDATE]

Disclaimer: English is not my first language, so sorry for eventual mistakes.
so me and my friend A we‚Äôre friends since the first year of university, and we can consider each other‚Äôs one of the best friends. Recently she moved out from her previous apartment because her parents are not supporting her flat expenses anymore because she didn‚Äôt graduate on time and they asked her to come back home ( she lives in another city). I told her she could stay at my place, and after talking to my parents they told me to charge her not even half the price of her previous apartment, she used to pay 800‚Ç¨ for a one roomed flat without the additional expenses while I asked her 300‚Ç¨ including everything (remember the flat is my parents and they suggested this price since we‚Äôre friends). She at first agreed, now she already stayed more than a month, and when I asked her about the money she told me ‚Äúisn‚Äôt it a bit too much for just the bills?‚Äù to which I told her is not something i‚Äôm taking care of bc it‚Äôs my parents doing. Also my parent are not currently living here anymore, it‚Äôs just me and my sister but we have separate rooms. Now what i‚Äôm asking is AITA for charging her? She‚Äôs supposed to stay till December, and she moved in on September. What should I do bc she let me in a really uncomfortable situation.

So my (23F) friend/roommate (22M) has been having very bad stomach issues for 6 years. He was asking me if he should start taking this medicine over this medication. I was trying to ask him questions to understand but overall I am not a doctor so I don‚Äôt know. He started talking about how he had tried every medicine and stuff like that and nothing have helped. Keep in mind this friend only eats fast food and drinks a lot of alcohol every day. 
I suggested him maybe trying doing meal preps or adding more fruits/ vegetables to his diet and see if that helps a little bit combined with medicine. I was not trying to lecture I was trying to be helpful and suggest like a trial and error. He started getting mad and said that is useless to be healthy here because all of the processed food. I told him that I know it is hard to leave the processed food but he could try to make the best of the situation. He got more upset saying he didn‚Äôt have time (he works from home twice a week and has weekends off). I was trying to be understanding because I know how it is to be busy and that is okay to not be perfect all the time. Like I just suggested trying to incorporate healthier for two or three weeks just a few times a day and see if that helps with anything. I suggested meal prepping as well.

He got very mad and frustrated and started shouting at me saying  that he has tried everything, nothing has helped and that he drinks and eats badly because he has given up. 
He then said he is tired of people lecturing him when he has tried things and that he hated how this conversation was going. 

I told him that is his health and in the end he can do whatever he feels best for himself. 

I feel kinda bad because I know where he is coming from. I have adhd and I‚Äôve had people trying to tell me what to do with it and it gets annoying, especially since I‚Äôve already tried those things, so I try to relate this situation to that, but at the same time in the past it has happened that we have arguments where he thinks he is in the right and is unable to listen to any sort of input (usually I just keep to myself and don‚Äôt say anything but this time I thought he was asking me for advice or an opinion this time).

Want to clarify I mind my own business, this time it seemed he was asking for my opinion and he is one of my best friends and I care about him. Apparently he was not asking for a suggestion. So AITA?

72,1gatgit,AITA for suggesting a lease change because of my sleepwalking roommate ,"I (F22) got utterly disturbed my roommate (M30?) last night for coming into my room. 

Some back story, I live with two men and have for the last 2 1/2 years. They have never done anything creepy towards me in the past, we all keep to ourselves and our spaces and don‚Äôt talk much to one another unless something comes up related to the apartment itself. 

Around 2am last night I was on facetime with my boyfriend when my door opened. My roommate was standing in the doorway, only in his underwear, staring blankly into my room. I immediately jumped up, thinking the worst was about to happen, and asked if he needed something. He didn‚Äôt respond and I continued asking with no response. He eventually said he was coming from the bathroom and I asked if he needed to go to the bathroom. He replied he couldn‚Äôt because there were people in there. At this point I thought he was on drugs or something. He then moved towards my bed and sat down on it. I told him he needed to get up and he started grabbing things on my bed, which i took out of his hands. He would stand up and sit down again and did this a couple times. At this point I was raising my voice saying You‚Äôre making me uncomfortable you need to get out of my room. He stood up and just stared- his cat came into my door way and i redirected his attention towards her and he slowly shuffled out. I closed and locked my door and then he began jiggling the handle trying to open it and knocking. I texted my other roommate who was luckily awake telling him to please get the other roommate. At this point it was already decided I was going to leave and spend the remainder of the night with my bf. My other roommate was able to get him back to his room and walked me out of the apartment incase anything else were to happen.

This morning, my other roommate told him what happened and he immediately texted me apologizing saying he was sleep walking and that he does sleep walk and talk. I have to take what he‚Äôs saying at face value, but as I mentioned I‚Äôve lived here for 2 1/2 years, I‚Äôm a major night owl and I have never seen or heard him do this before.

The tricky thing is our lease ends in 9 days. I had initially agreed to renew it for another year but after this happened I‚Äôm pretty freaked out. I might‚Äôve jumped the gun and texted my landlord telling him what happened and asking for a month to month lease instead incase things escalate and I need to move asap, which he agreed. I‚Äôm just worried my sleepwalking roommate might be mad/upset/bothered or something by me doing this, as he would probably know why our landlord is going to have us sign month to month instead of one year. Should I have even gotten my landlord involved?

74,1gatczq,AITA for requesting that someone else handle my appeal?,"I (a female in high school) was recently accused of breaking the honor code. 

Last Monday I was in a meeting with the guidance councilor. I was meeting with her about an issue that had took a really tole on me. It was affecting my ability to eat, sleep, and my other health issues. 

I was in the middle of that meeting when a teacher, I‚Äôll call her Ms. Williams, knocked on the door. She told the guidance counselor she needed to meet with me that very moment, and I was made to go meet with her.

I was really confused as to why I had to meet with her. For context she does not teach any of my classes, and I will never have her as a teacher. 

As I wondered what was so urgent, I was sat in another teachers classroom. In the room was Ms. Williams and the president of the honor council.

For context, I go to a private school. How my school deals with things like cheating and stealing is somebody reports it to the honor council. The council is sponsored by 2 teachers, and is made up representatives from each grade. The president and the teachers interview people when there is an accusation, and the council take what the president and teachers have to say and vote on a verdict.

When I saw the set up, I was really confused because I have never cheated, stolen, or lied in high school at school. 

They told me to sit down and asked me to talk about an English paper I had submitted a week ago. I started to explain what my essay was about and my thoughts on the prompt when the president cut me off and said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great but we don‚Äôt care about the content of your essay. Tell us about the timing of it.‚Äù

That made me even more confused. I was wondering why they were even talking to me if they thought I hadn‚Äôt cheated or used ai or something.

I told them I got an extension until a certain date because I missed school for an event. I explained my teacher made that extension clear in two emails.

I told them that I was sick the day the essay was due for me, and I completely forgot to turn it in.

I told them that when I returned to school, my English teacher, I‚Äôll call her Ms. Smith, asked me about it and I told her I forgot about it. When I went to my docs, I realized that I forgot to finish the conclusion paragraph.

I went into the hall to finish the conclusion paragraph, and do the finishing touches. At one point, my best friend came out into the hall and I asked her to peer edit.

We sat there for the last few minutes of class and did the finishing touches. 

When class ended I tried to submit the essay to turn it in.com. My essay was taking a while to upload. So I just shut my computer and went to go get the rest of my things.

When I went to classroom Ms. Smith asked me if I turned in my essay. I was honest and told her I was in the process of submitting it.

She told me to get out my computer and finish submitting, so I did.

I got out my computer and waited for my essay to finish uploading so I could review and hit submit.

It took around 5 minutes, but my essay finally uploaded and I could hit submit. I got the submission received screen, and told Ms. Smith I had submitted.

She asked if I needed an excuse for my next class, but I told her I would only be a few minutes late at worst and that the teacher probably wouldn‚Äôt care.

I put my computer away and went to my next class.

In my next class the teacher was explaining a test we took, so I didn‚Äôt have my computer out until he finished.

When he did, I took my computer out so I could do my class work/homework.

When I took my computer out, I was still on the turn it in page. I noticed I got a little error message. When I investigate further, I noticed it said there was no submission from me.

I immediately went to my essay, added page numbers and a few citations bc I noticed they were missing the first time, and re downloaded my essay. I submitted again, and it took like 8 minutes but I finally got the submissions screen again. 

I kept checking throughout the class to make sure I didn‚Äôt get another error message. When I didn‚Äôt even after 30 more minutes, I assumed I was good.

When I was explaining this, Ms. Williams cut me off and asked why I didn‚Äôt send a follow up email explaining what went wrong. 

I told her I didn‚Äôt think it necessary at the time, but when I tried to explain why she cut me off again.

She explained that as a teacher she understood why Ms. Smith thought I was lying. She expressed over and over again that me not sending a follow up email was indicative that I had something to hide.

Even as I kept trying to explain how a follow up email was just not part of my thought process of the time, she kept interrupting and implied that she also thought I was guilty. 

They cut the meeting off and said they needed to go interview Ms. Smith again.

I was really stressed out at this point because I was accused of something I didn‚Äôt do and Ms. Williams clearly thought I was guilty.

I started crying, and I went to go ask the guidance counselor for help.

As I was waiting outside the guidance counselor‚Äôs door, Ms. Williams and the honor council president pulled me back into the classroom.

They asked me to pull out my doc, so I did. They found 25-30 edits (I don‚Äôt remember the exact amount) after I submitted. I knew I made some of them after the initial submission, but I recognized that most of them were from during my English class.

Ms. Williams told me that edits appearing after the initial submission in my doc history proved that I didn‚Äôt make the initial submission.

Before I could mention I had a witness who could corroborate my side of the story, they made me leave the room and held the meeting with the entire council.

Right after they kicked me out, I researched why edits were appearing in Google docs history when they didn‚Äôt happen. I wrote this based on what I found: 

It is possible for edits to appear on version¬†history after the fact. Here is how: 1.) Delayed syncing or cache release. When a laptop is closed while working on google docs, any edits you may have made earlier may not have synced until you reopened it. Even though Google Docs tries to sync automatically, network issues or closing the laptop too soon might prevent immediate syncing. 2.) Background saves and system lag. Sometimes, Google Docs splits big changes into multiple small updates, even for continuous edits. For example, adjusting margins or spacing could result in multiple small edits in the version history, even if I made them in one sitting before 12:00. 3.) Version history limits. While Google Docs version history provides records of edits, it‚Äôs not infallible. It focuses more on when changes were saved to the cloud, not necessarily when you made the changes. Timestamps alone do not reflect when my hands were on the keyboard, especially if syncing delays occurred. 4.) Internet issues. Issues with the internet, which there are a lot of at this school, can delay when changes are recorded on version history. All of the factors could have led to my edits showing up after I made them. Now I am no Google Docs expert, and today has made clear to me that your establishment doubts my integrity. So here are some sources where I am getting my information from: 
1. Google Docs - Work offline
2. Google Drive Community - Syncing Issues
3. Troubleshooting Sync Issues in Google Docs

When I went to go give what I wrote to Ms. Williams along with the fact that I had a witness, she told me that the time for that had already passed. She said that the council had already made their decision.

I got email later demanding that I meet with Ms. Williams, the council president, and another teacher after school. 

When I showed up, they told me that the council found me guilty because of the edits. They told me that I have the right to appeal.

I told them I wanted to, and they said that if I do anonymity goes out the door at that the rest of the council will know who I am.

I don‚Äôt want this for two reasons. 

1.) I have a friend in the council and I know others on it.

2.) I don‚Äôt trust them to hear my side of the story because of how they treated me during the initial trial. They told me that I had a right to due process, and that I was innocent until proven guilty. However, I don‚Äôt believe that the council maintained this principle of innocent until proven guilty.

Throughout both interviews I was cut off and told how things looked from a teachers perspective. Ms. Williams kept implying that I did everything wrong and that everybody thought I was guilty. Especially with the edits and the follow up email line of questioning.

I also think they failed to maintain innocence until proven guilty based off of these emails between me and Ms. Williams:

Ms. Williams: 
‚ÄúHere's the link for the constitution that I mentioned in our after-school meeting.

Reach out with any questions or concerns‚Äù

Me: 
‚ÄúHello.

I have a few questions for you, if you don't mind answering.

1.) What was the burden of proof? Who was the burden of proof placed on?

2.) How were the interviews with Ms. Smith structured? Were both of our interviews structured in the same way?

3.) Can you explain in detail how the Google Docs history was interpreted?

4.) How was the situation explained to the entire council?


This one is kind of unrelated, but I think it's important to ask after reading the constitution.

5.) Why does the constitution do little to outline the rights of students not on the council?‚Äù

Ms. Williams: 
‚Äú1. We had the Google Edit History on your document as evidence that backed up what Ms. Smith told us in her original statement with the submission on Turn It In being after her class ended.  

2. We asked Ms. Smith to share her side of the story/timeline with us, and HC president took notes. 

3. I answered this question in my response to your first question.

4. We followed standard protocol: We used a random name instead of your name during the meeting. HC president read the notes from your interviews, some students asked questions, then they voted and it was unanimous. Finally, they decided on the consequences.

5. The constitution specifically outlines the process and procedures of how we handle cases.‚Äù

Me: 
‚ÄúHello,
1.) Thank you for taking the time to answer, but this did not answer my question. My original question was what was the burden of proof and who was that burden placed upon.
A burden of proof is the obligation to prove one's claim.
The burden of proof varies from case to case. So in the legal world, in a criminal case the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that the prosecution must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the defense is guilty.
However is civil cases, the burden of proof is by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the defense more likely than not liable for what ever the plaintiff is claiming.
So my original question was asking for the council's burden of proof and who it was placed on. Was the burden placed on Ms. Smith or me? If the burden was placed on Ms. Smith to what degree did she have to prove I was guilty. If the burden was placed on me, to what degree did I have to prove I was innocent?

2.) Thank you for answering the question. Was asked questions about how something would look from my perspective. I'm asking this since you asked me to answer how things would look from Ms.
Smith‚Äôs perspective. Was she allowed to speak freely in her side of the story or was she continually being asked to prove everything she was saying was absolute fact and truth.

3.) Thank you for answering the question. However, I have another one. How did the Google edit History prove what Ms. Smith said.

I'm confused as to the facts that are in contention in today's case. I previously thought that what I was being accused of was lying  about turning my document into turn it in and the end of the class, not wether or not I edited after my submission didn't go through.

My question is why did those edits make me a liar?

4.) Thank you for answering the question. I have a follow up question. How were the notes taken. Did auta use voice to text? Or did she take them based only on what she thought she heard. Also can I have a copy of these notes?

5.) Thank you for answering the question. However your answer doesn't answer my original question. While I recognize your constitution outlines the process and procedures of cases, it doesn't mention much about the rights of students other than the right to appeal. Why does your constitution do you little to outline the rights of students who are not on the council?
Thank you.‚Äù

Ms Williams: 
‚ÄúHey
Thanks for following up. I think these questions can be answered in a meeting if you are choosing to continue with the appeal! I just don't want there to be any confusion around the questions you are asking. Let LEasE respre, or I know if you are going to go through with the in-person appeal found in our constitution with our executive council of juniors and seniors.
Thanks,‚Äù

Me: ‚ÄúHello,
I plan to meet with head of school during ____ period tomorrow to see if I can appeal in front of her instead of the executive council. This is for the reasons I stated in my email to you. Like I said, I did not feel safe, respected, listened to, or heard during my initial trial. I do not trust the council to give me a fair appeal based on my initial trial.
Thank you,

Hello again,
I understand that these questions can be answered in a meeting but I would appreciate if you could answer my first, second, and fourth question. This is because it would help clear up a few things in my mind and help me in my meeting tomorrow‚Äù 

The fact that she didn‚Äôt answer my question about the burden of proof leads me to believe that there either wasn‚Äôt one, it was placed on me, or that they did not have to prove to a reasonable degree that I was guilty of lying to Ms. Smith.

She has also not responded to my email for more than 24 hours at this point.

So, Am I the asshole for sending this email:

‚ÄúToday, I was pulled out of a meeting to be sat in a room by the honor council and be accused of lying. That was extremely disrespectful towards me. I was in that meeting for a reason. There has been some stuff going on in my life which has affected my ability to eat, sleep, and my health issues. That meeting was to talk about those things and help me get to a point where it would be easier to eat, sleep, and manage my health issues. I wasn't able to finish that meeting. I wasn't able to finish that meeting because the Honor Council pulled me from what I was doing to attack my integrity. While I understand the honor council needed to sit and hear my side of the story, I felt like they didn't even respect me enough to collaborate on a time. They didn't ask me what worked for me. They didn't ask if I could meet-
Fand they certainly
didn't ask if I could meet at 3:20. They were not considerate of my time and my schedule whatsoever.


During the meeting, the questioning was particularly frustrating. I felt I was cut off repeatedly, and instead of engaging with my perspective, I was pressed to consider how my actions might be perceived by a teacher. It was clear that i
S's authority
loomed large in the room, as the council member seemed to suggest that her perspective alone was sufficient to determine my guilt. The implication was that my failure to follow up with an email meant I had something to hide. This line of reasoning felt dismissive and unfair, as it disregarded the context of my actions in the moment. It made me feel like I was expected to govern my actions assuming everything I do is governed by the possibility I will be accused. Being treated as if I were already guilty made the entire experience more distressing. I felt marginalized and invalidated, as though my struggles didn't matter in the face of their assumptions. I had hoped for a more open dialogue, where I could share my side of the story without fear of being judged.
Instead, I left feeling defeated and disheartened, as if my efforts to prioritize my well-being had been cast aside in favor of a rush to judgment. This encounter not only left me questioning the council's approach but also affected my sense of trust and safety within the community.
These feelings of disrespect and assumed guilt made it difficult for me to share my side of the story. I felt judged and looked down upon, and that I didn't have the opportunity to say all that I needed to say. I would like to feel listened to and heard.
It is for these reasons that I would like to request a change in who is handling my case for my appeal. I would rather handle this with you, since the past you have heard my side of the story,
and l've felt listened to and heard, unlike today.
Thank you,‚Äù

 to head of school and requesting a meeting to change who is handling my appeal.",TL;DR,2024-10-24,"AITA for requesting that someone else handle my appeal? I (a female in high school) was recently accused of breaking the honor code. 

Last Monday I was in a meeting with the guidance councilor. I was meeting with her about an issue that had took a really tole on me. It was affecting my ability to eat, sleep, and my other health issues. 

I was in the middle of that meeting when a teacher, I‚Äôll call her Ms. Williams, knocked on the door. She told the guidance counselor she needed to meet with me that very moment, and I was made to go meet with her.

I was really confused as to why I had to meet with her. For context she does not teach any of my classes, and I will never have her as a teacher. 

As I wondered what was so urgent, I was sat in another teachers classroom. In the room was Ms. Williams and the president of the honor council.

For context, I go to a private school. How my school deals with things like cheating and stealing is somebody reports it to the honor council. The council is sponsored by 2 teachers, and is made up representatives from each grade. The president and the teachers interview people when there is an accusation, and the council take what the president and teachers have to say and vote on a verdict.

When I saw the set up, I was really confused because I have never cheated, stolen, or lied in high school at school. 

They told me to sit down and asked me to talk about an English paper I had submitted a week ago. I started to explain what my essay was about and my thoughts on the prompt when the president cut me off and said ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs great but we don‚Äôt care about the content of your essay. Tell us about the timing of it.‚Äù

That made me even more confused. I was wondering why they were even talking to me if they thought I hadn‚Äôt cheated or used ai or something.

I told them I got an extension until a certain date because I missed school for an event. I explained my teacher made that extension clear in two emails.

I told them that I was sick the day the essay was due for me, and I completely forgot to turn it in.

I told them that when I returned to school, my English teacher, I‚Äôll call her Ms. Smith, asked me about it and I told her I forgot about it. When I went to my docs, I realized that I forgot to finish the conclusion paragraph.

I went into the hall to finish the conclusion paragraph, and do the finishing touches. At one point, my best friend came out into the hall and I asked her to peer edit.

We sat there for the last few minutes of class and did the finishing touches. 

When class ended I tried to submit the essay to turn it in.com. My essay was taking a while to upload. So I just shut my computer and went to go get the rest of my things.

When I went to classroom Ms. Smith asked me if I turned in my essay. I was honest and told her I was in the process of submitting it.

She told me to get out my computer and finish submitting, so I did.

I got out my computer and waited for my essay to finish uploading so I could review and hit submit.

It took around 5 minutes, but my essay finally uploaded and I could hit submit. I got the submission received screen, and told Ms. Smith I had submitted.

She asked if I needed an excuse for my next class, but I told her I would only be a few minutes late at worst and that the teacher probably wouldn‚Äôt care.

I put my computer away and went to my next class.

In my next class the teacher was explaining a test we took, so I didn‚Äôt have my computer out until he finished.

When he did, I took my computer out so I could do my class work/homework.

When I took my computer out, I was still on the turn it in page. I noticed I got a little error message. When I investigate further, I noticed it said there was no submission from me.

I immediately went to my essay, added page numbers and a few citations bc I noticed they were missing the first time, and re downloaded my essay. I submitted again, and it took like 8 minutes but I finally got the submissions screen again. 

I kept checking throughout the class to make sure I didn‚Äôt get another error message. When I didn‚Äôt even after 30 more minutes, I assumed I was good.

When I was explaining this, Ms. Williams cut me off and asked why I didn‚Äôt send a follow up email explaining what went wrong. 

I told her I didn‚Äôt think it necessary at the time, but when I tried to explain why she cut me off again.

She explained that as a teacher she understood why Ms. Smith thought I was lying. She expressed over and over again that me not sending a follow up email was indicative that I had something to hide.

Even as I kept trying to explain how a follow up email was just not part of my thought process of the time, she kept interrupting and implied that she also thought I was guilty. 

They cut the meeting off and said they needed to go interview Ms. Smith again.

I was really stressed out at this point because I was accused of something I didn‚Äôt do and Ms. Williams clearly thought I was guilty.

I started crying, and I went to go ask the guidance counselor for help.

As I was waiting outside the guidance counselor‚Äôs door, Ms. Williams and the honor council president pulled me back into the classroom.

They asked me to pull out my doc, so I did. They found 25-30 edits (I don‚Äôt remember the exact amount) after I submitted. I knew I made some of them after the initial submission, but I recognized that most of them were from during my English class.

Ms. Williams told me that edits appearing after the initial submission in my doc history proved that I didn‚Äôt make the initial submission.

Before I could mention I had a witness who could corroborate my side of the story, they made me leave the room and held the meeting with the entire council.

Right after they kicked me out, I researched why edits were appearing in Google docs history when they didn‚Äôt happen. I wrote this based on what I found: 

It is possible for edits to appear on version¬†history after the fact. Here is how: 1.) Delayed syncing or cache release. When a laptop is closed while working on google docs, any edits you may have made earlier may not have synced until you reopened it. Even though Google Docs tries to sync automatically, network issues or closing the laptop too soon might prevent immediate syncing. 2.) Background saves and system lag. Sometimes, Google Docs splits big changes into multiple small updates, even for continuous edits. For example, adjusting margins or spacing could result in multiple small edits in the version history, even if I made them in one sitting before 12:00. 3.) Version history limits. While Google Docs version history provides records of edits, it‚Äôs not infallible. It focuses more on when changes were saved to the cloud, not necessarily when you made the changes. Timestamps alone do not reflect when my hands were on the keyboard, especially if syncing delays occurred. 4.) Internet issues. Issues with the internet, which there are a lot of at this school, can delay when changes are recorded on version history. All of the factors could have led to my edits showing up after I made them. Now I am no Google Docs expert, and today has made clear to me that your establishment doubts my integrity. So here are some sources where I am getting my information from: 
1. Google Docs - Work offline
2. Google Drive Community - Syncing Issues
3. Troubleshooting Sync Issues in Google Docs

When I went to go give what I wrote to Ms. Williams along with the fact that I had a witness, she told me that the time for that had already passed. She said that the council had already made their decision.

I got email later demanding that I meet with Ms. Williams, the council president, and another teacher after school. 

When I showed up, they told me that the council found me guilty because of the edits. They told me that I have the right to appeal.

I told them I wanted to, and they said that if I do anonymity goes out the door at that the rest of the council will know who I am.

I don‚Äôt want this for two reasons. 

1.) I have a friend in the council and I know others on it.

2.) I don‚Äôt trust them to hear my side of the story because of how they treated me during the initial trial. They told me that I had a right to due process, and that I was innocent until proven guilty. However, I don‚Äôt believe that the council maintained this principle of innocent until proven guilty.

Throughout both interviews I was cut off and told how things looked from a teachers perspective. Ms. Williams kept implying that I did everything wrong and that everybody thought I was guilty. Especially with the edits and the follow up email line of questioning.

I also think they failed to maintain innocence until proven guilty based off of these emails between me and Ms. Williams:

Ms. Williams: 
‚ÄúHere's the link for the constitution that I mentioned in our after-school meeting.

Reach out with any questions or concerns‚Äù

Me: 
‚ÄúHello.

I have a few questions for you, if you don't mind answering.

1.) What was the burden of proof? Who was the burden of proof placed on?

2.) How were the interviews with Ms. Smith structured? Were both of our interviews structured in the same way?

3.) Can you explain in detail how the Google Docs history was interpreted?

4.) How was the situation explained to the entire council?


This one is kind of unrelated, but I think it's important to ask after reading the constitution.

5.) Why does the constitution do little to outline the rights of students not on the council?‚Äù

Ms. Williams: 
‚Äú1. We had the Google Edit History on your document as evidence that backed up what Ms. Smith told us in her original statement with the submission on Turn It In being after her class ended.  

2. We asked Ms. Smith to share her side of the story/timeline with us, and HC president took notes. 

3. I answered this question in my response to your first question.

4. We followed standard protocol: We used a random name instead of your name during the meeting. HC president read the notes from your interviews, some students asked questions, then they voted and it was unanimous. Finally, they decided on the consequences.

5. The constitution specifically outlines the process and procedures of how we handle cases.‚Äù

Me: 
‚ÄúHello,
1.) Thank you for taking the time to answer, but this did not answer my question. My original question was what was the burden of proof and who was that burden placed upon.
A burden of proof is the obligation to prove one's claim.
The burden of proof varies from case to case. So in the legal world, in a criminal case the burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that the prosecution must prove beyond any reasonable doubt that the defense is guilty.
However is civil cases, the burden of proof is by a preponderance of evidence. This means that the defense more likely than not liable for what ever the plaintiff is claiming.
So my original question was asking for the council's burden of proof and who it was placed on. Was the burden placed on Ms. Smith or me? If the burden was placed on Ms. Smith to what degree did she have to prove I was guilty. If the burden was placed on me, to what degree did I have to prove I was innocent?

2.) Thank you for answering the question. Was asked questions about how something would look from my perspective. I'm asking this since you asked me to answer how things would look from Ms.
Smith‚Äôs perspective. Was she allowed to speak freely in her side of the story or was she continually being asked to prove everything she was saying was absolute fact and truth.

3.) Thank you for answering the question. However, I have another one. How did the Google edit History prove what Ms. Smith said.

I'm confused as to the facts that are in contention in today's case. I previously thought that what I was being accused of was lying  about turning my document into turn it in and the end of the class, not wether or not I edited after my submission didn't go through. (By the way I plan to adress edits on my appeal and why edits are showing up when they don't happen).

My question is why did those edits make me a liar?

4.) Thank you for answering the question. I have a follow up question. How were the notes taken. Did auta use voice to text? Or did she take them based only on what she thought she heard. Also can I have a copy of these notes?

5.) Thank you for answering the question. However your answer doesn't answer my original question. While I recognize your constitution outlines the process and procedures of cases, it doesn't mention much about the rights of students other than the right to appeal. Why does your constitution do you little to outline the rights of students who are not on the council?

I‚Äôve seen the dogs show little sign of recall ability and have seen them chase the tennis ball into traffic, thankfully at that time there weren‚Äôt any cars coming, but it absolutely could have been the opposite situation.

So, I went back inside and took photos from my patio window like an old crotchety person and emailed them to the office. 
There used to be other people who did this but the apartments sent out a message a few months back and told people that it was a lease violation and they‚Äôd either be fined or evicted for continuing that behavior.

77,1gasyo0,WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt take my friend to the football game we‚Äôve been planning all month?,"I (25F) have a FWB (35M) who‚Äôs really into football & his home town. He suggested we go to a local football game because his home town is playing in mine. He wanted to bring his 14 year old son as it would be his first ever NFL  game and tailgating experience.

I make $32/hr, and he works two jobs from 7am-8pm making $18/hr. When you do the math, we make roughly the same amount.

Well, I bought the tickets to this football game @ over $150 each. He promised he‚Äôd pay me back in installments, bc he didn‚Äôt have enough to buy all the tickets at once. At first, he offered to buy my ticket as well, but bc of the pricing, I offered to pay for my own. He now owes me basically $400.

I‚Äôve been asking him to pay me back something, and he said he would do it, but he just says ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll do it‚Äù and then never does, prompting me to ask over & over with no explanation, just empty promises. This happened before one time for $30, but I thought this would be different bc it‚Äôs for his son. He said he had a lot on his mind, but he was active on social media.

I told him since the game is on Sunday, I need something before then. I‚Äôm seriously debating just taking my own family & leaving him behind if he doesn‚Äôt pay me a part of the $400. I mean, im not even asking for the total amount.

I feel really bad, though. After all, this is his son‚Äôs first NFL game. Also, I think he may have more financial responsibilities than I do. He‚Äôs saving up for a car and has two children. However, I have a car payment & I pay rent among other things (he doesn‚Äôt). So I don‚Äôt know. Plus, it‚Äôs not like he never pays for anything. We hang out & always pays for our food, and even bought me medicine once when I had the flu, and he gave me gas money in multiple occasions.

Yet, just the other day, he asked me to help him get a car by registering it in my name and put him on my insurance plan because his license is suspended, and he‚Äôll pay his share. I obviously said no, due to the ticket situation. We‚Äôre just FWB, not even in a relationship.

So, would I be the asshole if I leave him & his son behind to take my own family to the game if he doesn‚Äôt pay me anything back?",Not enough info,2024-10-24,"WIBTA if I didn‚Äôt take my friend to the football game we‚Äôve been planning all month? I (25F) have a FWB (35M) who‚Äôs really into football & his home town. He suggested we go to a local football game because his home town is playing in mine. He wanted to bring his 14 year old son as it would be his first ever NFL  game and tailgating experience.

I make $32/hr, and he works two jobs from 7am-8pm making $18/hr. When you do the math, we make roughly the same amount.

Well, I bought the tickets to this football game @ over $150 each. He promised he‚Äôd pay me back in installments, bc he didn‚Äôt have enough to buy all the tickets at once. At first, he offered to buy my ticket as well, but bc of the pricing, I offered to pay for my own. He now owes me basically $400.

I‚Äôve been asking him to pay me back something, and he said he would do it, but he just says ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôll do it‚Äù and then never does, prompting me to ask over & over with no explanation, just empty promises. This happened before one time for $30, but I thought this would be different bc it‚Äôs for his son. He said he had a lot on his mind, but he was active on social media.

I told him since the game is on Sunday, I need something before then. I‚Äôm seriously debating just taking my own family & leaving him behind if he doesn‚Äôt pay me a part of the $400. I mean, im not even asking for the total amount.

I feel really bad, though. After all, this is his son‚Äôs first NFL game. Also, I think he may have more financial responsibilities than I do. He‚Äôs saving up for a car and has two children. However, I have a car payment & I pay rent among other things (he doesn‚Äôt). So I don‚Äôt know. Plus, it‚Äôs not like he never pays for anything. We hang out & always pays for our food, and even bought me medicine once when I had the flu, and he gave me gas money in multiple occasions.

It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs $400, and he said he would pay me back. I‚Äôve told him I‚Äôve been screwed over with money in the past, and he knows how important this is to me.

Our families were both neighbors and best friends before and after we were both born, they took care of us when my father passed when i was 12. Dave and his family ended up moving our sophomore year of high-school but we still remained close. We both moved on with our lives. He met a woman and got married, then divorced 4 years later.

82,1gas55z,AITAH For Not Spending Time With My Niece?,"I (18F) don‚Äôt want to spend time with my niece. 

I don't like kids who never have and never will. I have many reasons for this, but to sum up, I find them very overstimulating. I have a niece who is 5 years old. She's a very kind girl, and I have nothing against her. I don't like children and don‚Äôt enjoy spending time with her. I don‚Äôt mind watching over her when I have to or taking her out somewhere when I‚Äôm asked, but I never offer to do these things because I don‚Äôt enjoy doing it. But I don‚Äôt complain because my niece is a very demanding child; she is an only child with above-average intelligence for her age, so she constantly needs stimulation. Because she has no siblings, she continually seeks the adults' attention.

I have five siblings, and my oldest sibling is her mom. My sister and I are pretty close, and we enjoy spending time together even though we are very different in some ways. She loves children. I do not.

It‚Äôs not that I dread the times I have to watch over her, but I only do it to alleviate the stress on my parents, who are in their early 50s and both work demanding jobs and, some weekends, have to babysit a demanding child. It isn't a problem, especially when I can play on my phone while she watches Bluey until someone else comes home. 

The problem is that she often asks me to do activities with her. She never enjoys doing something alone and always wants someone to be there with her when coloring, reading, or playing. She constantly asks the adults to play tag with her when no one wants to, and I feel bad for her and everyone else.

I especially feel bad when she asks me to do things I don‚Äôt want. I won't always say no, but today, she kept informing me she wanted to play Fortnite, and all I said was ‚Äúokay‚Äù each time since she had her own Nintendo Switch that she plays on. 

She came into my room and asked when we would play together. I said I didn't want to, but she said I told her I would play later, which I never did. I don't want to beef with a 5-year-old, but I was frustrated when she insisted I did. I told her she could play alone, but she didn't want to. By this point, I was getting annoyed and told her no, and she left while storming off. I didn't think much of it, but now I feel bad. She's just a kid looking to have fun with me, but I also can't help but acknowledge I don't have to do anything I don‚Äôt want to. 

My parents have stated they think I should spend more time with her and that I'm ‚Äúrude‚Äù to her even though I feel I‚Äôm simply correcting her behavior. It‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm disciplining her, but sometimes she‚Äôll go into my room and take things or come into it and persist in taking them but doesn't return them until I take them back.

He's the eldest of four boys and is quite helpful. I told my brother that Cade got off easy with Jeremy and he ought to be a better parent.",0.0,1.0181724,1,0

My mother is often away on trips but when she's around she cooks for me and my brother (35). When our mom is away, of course I cook for myself but I also include him. He lives a few doors down our mom's unit. It's become kind of my responsibility bc whenever my mom asks me how im doing and what im having for my meals she would always include my brother. Recently, I stopped cooking for him & told him he should start cooking for himself. He doesn't have his own fridge but he has a nice stove that our mother bought for him. I don't think he's ever used it. Ever. I hope that he‚Äôll also buy his own fridge. I stopped cooking for him bc I have started to build resentment towards him. He doesn't do anything but focus on himself but he doesn't even take care of himself well. I'm so annoyed that I, the younger sister, have to cook for him too. He doesn't even do his own dishes right away. I‚Äôve told him plenty of times to do the dishes right away bc i hate having to see it every time I pass by the dinner table. He even critcizes/critiques(?) my cooking sometimes wc annoys me even more bc he doesn't even cook. Look, I understand giving feedback is fine; it helps improve the taste but I just can't help but think he doesn't have the right bc this isn't a damn restaurant where hes a customer but im doing him a favor im not even obligated to. We're both working adults. Im a morning person so I like to get up early, prepare my food before going to work but he wakes up so late, and do god knows what before going to work. Also, he has a flexible schedule. He doesn't understand how much labor (in all aspects) it takes to cook. He‚Äôs cooked for us before but that was only when he was in the mood and it was always the same dish. When he cooked for us, he didn't clean up right away. He used our mother's kitchen btw.

This happens every few weeks and I bring it up and he kinda fixes it for a few days. This week, my 2 year old nephew has been admitted to hospital and is not getting better. I've been worried sick for days and when my fianc√© and I talk I've kept him up to date about my nephews illness. 

Today, my fianc√© hadn't text me back by 1pm so I decided to call him for comfort (just needed to hear his voice). We chatted and I told him about how worried I was (I had a headache from worry). He said he'd call me after work at around 10pm. 10pm came and went. At 11pm he text me and said he was going to the gym after work. I fell asleep waiting for him to call. I then am woken up at 2am by a phone call from him. 

I'm super pissed because he's been in the gym for 3 hours??? And didn't text to say anything about it. I confronted him about this and he said he got carried away hanging out with friends at the gym. I told him I feel like this was so inconsiderate. A text so I can manage my time and expectations isn't too much to ask, I think? 

I won't answer his calls anymore because he thinks I'm being unreasonable for thinking he isn't supportive and doesn't care enough to drop me a text. He's even just sent me a message saying 'what makes you think I don't care?'. I don't know, AITA? Am I overreacting?

92,1gaqy1b,AITA for accusing my bf of not wanting my relationship with his mom to get better?,"I (19f) have been together with my boyfriend (19m) for a little over two years. We met in highschool as I was new to the school and he was hanging out with some new friends of mine. We started talking about games we both play (overwatch, valorant and league) and our relationship went on from there. 
Last year, I was dealing with some family issues. My grandma from my mom's side had colon cancer and my dad's uncle had surgery. We were the only family with a house in a city so we had to take care of several family members, as well as paying for the chemo and the surgery. 
Now, I need to mention that before I moved back to my home country, me and my bf had a major fall off in which he had said some pretty horrible things to me, gotten in fights with my dad and overall we were in a bad place. As a petty response to his arguments and behaviour, I did say some horrible stuff back, which ended up being overheard by his mother. His mother didn't know about the argument from beforehand and she just assumed I was rude to her son for no apparent reason. 
So, while I was in my home country, I made her a huge eternal flowers bouquet containing 105 flowers. I was super proud of how they turned out and since I'm visiting his city for three weeks, I decided to give them to her two days ago.
I went over around noon and after I get there, I notice his parents aren't home. Now, when I went there, I had assumed that my boyfriend had already told her about the misunderstanding and about our argument. I asked him if she knows about our relationship and apparently she does not. I give him the bouquet and tell him to say it was from me. He looked at me pretty weirded out and asked ""okay but what's she going to do with these?"". I told him she can use it as a decoration or consider it an apology for the misunderstanding. He got defensive saying she doesn't like me and that giving her a gift was pointless and weird. We didn't get to fight much as he rushed me out of the house and told me to leave before his mom gets back. Later that day, I asked him if he gave the flowers to her and he said ""not yet, I'm still thinking about it"". I asked him what's there to think about, all he needs to do is give them to her and say it's from me. 
Now here's the part where I might be TA. My boyfriend lashed out saying she doesn't like me and it's not like my bouquet would fix our relationship. I'm aware it won't, but in my eyes it is still a pretty sweet gesture that won't cause any harm.

Ps, soz this is rushed, character limit is only 3k",Asshole,2024-10-24,"AITA for accusing my bf of not wanting my relationship with his mom to get better? I (19f) have been together with my boyfriend (19m) for a little over two years. We met in highschool as I was new to the school and he was hanging out with some new friends of mine. We started talking about games we both play (overwatch, valorant and league) and our relationship went on from there. 
Last year, I was dealing with some family issues. My grandma from my mom's side had colon cancer and my dad's uncle had surgery. We were the only family with a house in a city so we had to take care of several family members, as well as paying for the chemo and the surgery. 
Now, I need to mention that before I moved back to my home country, me and my bf had a major fall off in which he had said some pretty horrible things to me, gotten in fights with my dad and overall we were in a bad place. As a petty response to his arguments and behaviour, I did say some horrible stuff back, which ended up being overheard by his mother. His mother didn't know about the argument from beforehand and she just assumed I was rude to her son for no apparent reason. 
So, while I was in my home country, I made her a huge eternal flowers bouquet containing 105 flowers. I was super proud of how they turned out and since I'm visiting his city for three weeks, I decided to give them to her two days ago.
I went over around noon and after I get there, I notice his parents aren't home. Now, when I went there, I had assumed that my boyfriend had already told her about the misunderstanding and about our argument. I asked him if she knows about our relationship and apparently she does not. I give him the bouquet and tell him to say it was from me. He looked at me pretty weirded out and asked ""okay but what's she going to do with these?"". I told him she can use it as a decoration or consider it an apology for the misunderstanding. He got defensive saying she doesn't like me and that giving her a gift was pointless and weird. We didn't get to fight much as he rushed me out of the house and told me to leave before his mom gets back. Later that day, I asked him if he gave the flowers to her and he said ""not yet, I'm still thinking about it"". I asked him what's there to think about, all he needs to do is give them to her and say it's from me. 
Now here's the part where I might be TA. My boyfriend lashed out saying she doesn't like me and it's not like my bouquet would fix our relationship. I'm aware it won't, but in my eyes it is still a pretty sweet gesture that won't cause any harm. I told him I was planning to have a conversation with her about the misunderstanding, he got angry and told me I'm doing too much. I got mad at him for not giving his mom my bouquet and accused him of not wanting my relationship with her to get better. I argued that he didn't tell her about the misunderstanding, didn't make it clear we're still dating nor does he want me to actually fix things with her. AITA?

Immediately after though, he got angry. He said he doesn't know why I have to tell him what to eat like he's a child. I said, I shouldn't even have to tell a grown man not to eat three PB&J sandwiches at once. He said he should be able to eat whatever he wants because he's an adult.

In this case, I had at least 100 coins while the next closest to me had 80 (a CPU) and the remaining two had around 40 coins (including my bf). After some thought, my boyfriend decided that he would steal from me, as I had the most. I understood, but told him ‚Äúyou are opening the gate to steal from each other, be careful‚Äù. He then chose me, and took 9 coins from me. The problem occurs when we‚Äôre on round 13/15 and I get to the boo and have the option to steal. At this point, everyone (besides me) is close enough to the star to get it and has enough coins for it as well. I had 0 stars, my bf had 2, and the CPU‚Äôs had 1 each.

This is where the problem is. He believed that since he stole coins from me (while I had plenty to spare) that I should only be able to steal coins back OR a star if he had plenty of stars to spare. 

Whereas I believe that if a player steals anything, then the stolen from player can also steal anything. 

For more context, we were on the Mario‚Äôs Rainbow Castle map. Which if you don‚Äôt know the map, the Star is in the same spot, but switches from getting a Star to just losing 20 coins, no star. I only mention it bc strategizing can be difficult.
