0,1gc2347,AITA for allowing a boy to pet my dig without knowing about his religious restrictions?,"I took my newly adopted dog to the vet to get her routine checkup and there was a boy ( around 5-6years) with his sister and mother and they had a cat. The mom went inside to meet the doctor and asked the boy to sit in the lobby. He asked me if he can pet the dog and I said ok and that she is really friendly and loves kids. His mom came back shortly and scolded him for petting the dog and asked us why we let him, and I told her it was okay because the dog is really friendly and she said that its not that its because their religion doesnt allow people interacting with dogs.

PS - I am not posting here to get conformation about the religious beliefs, just confirming if I was wrong letting the boy pet my dog.

1,1gc1ur5,AITA for not telling my friend that the boy she’s in love with might not like her back?,"I F17 never thought I’d write a story on Reddit, but here I am. OK, so, as a summary: a friend of mine likes a boy in our class.

Let’s start from the beginning. School started a month ago. Everything is super OK. For a few days now, one of my classmates, whom we’ll call Didi F17, has been in love with a boy we’ll call Max M17 (I didn’t use anyone’s real name). What’s not clear here is that Didi is madly IN LOVE with him, and she’s only known him for three weeks. She hadn’t talked to him at all until the third week, and then she only started talking about how well he dresses.

For reference, this guy is VERY nice to everyone and doesn’t change his behavior with anyone. Didi does anything to touch him or talk to him, and in the past two days, she keeps asking him for his water bottle so she can drink from it.

Three other classmates and I are trying to get them together, but honestly, I think it’s just the other three who are trying because I’m not really convinced they’re meant to be together. I’m just going along with the other three because I thought I might be overthinking, but that’s not the case, because that guy only gives her attention when she starts the conversation. If she doesn’t, he doesn’t initiate anything with her, but with the guys, for example, he does interact.

A friend named Bibi (they’re really close friends but not sisters or anything) said something like, “Did you see how he looked at you?” But the weirdest thing is that he looks at everyone the same way. I know this because I paid close attention to his facial expressions while he was talking to Didi, Bibi, me, and even the guys.

Didi believes that when he smiles, he does it because of her and that they’ll end up together. To prove he acts the same with everyone, I’ll tell you that, during a class, I was randomly looking around, and for some reason, I stopped my gaze on him, and he was looking at me. Since I couldn’t help it, I started laughing, and he laughed along with me, then smiled at me the whole hour, and I smiled back. I told Didi that I saw Max smiling and said maybe he does it because of her (I think this was my biggest mistake). This happened this week, and I really want to know if this guy likes her or not. I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO TO FIND OUT, BECAUSE I DON’T WANT TO ASK HIM, AS THAT WOULD LEAD TO A FIGHT, AND DIDI WOULD GET MAD AT ME.

P.S.: I asked some friends outside of school who don’t know either Didi or Max, and they told me to just tell Didi that Max might not like her because she could end up getting too attached to him, and he might not feel the same way. It would break her heart.

2,1gc1rlh,AITA for not giving my husband more sympathy? ,"I own my own business and for the last 3 years have been working insanely hard to build a successful company to provide for my family. My husband stopped working after we had our first child - it just made more sense to have a parent raise our LO, something we are very fortunate to have. I recently have been under a lot of pressure at work, and during a particularly stressful week, our LO got a stomach bug. Hubby and I looked after her through it, and she recovered in a day or so. But then my husband got the bug. Which meant that I was solo parenting, juggling work, and on the point of a breakdown. My husband seemed back on his feet and feeling better, and i had to travel for a few days for work, but then my husband said he wasn’t feeling great. He left our daughter with a family member for a few days to recover, but just wallowed in feeling sick - he didn’t go to the doctor or take medication, and didn’t eat or stay hydrated. Every time I called to check in on him he was kind of wallowing in how he still felt nauseas. I came back from my trip today - an incredibly stressful one where I slept around 2 hours each night trying to make up from work I missed while they were both sick. I told my husband I felt more stressed than I have in months. I arrived back today, absolutely shattered. He felt too unwell to fetch me from the airport, I got home, picked up my daughter from family, juggled dinner and bath all while my husband lay on the sofa. I scolded him for not going to the doctor, and for not eating for 4 days - obviously he felt weak and light headed if he had not had even some toast or water!! He then confronted me about being short tempered and told me I have not been sensitive and considerate enough toward him. 
Am I the asshole?!

EDIT TO ADD: 
- I value the work my husband does as the SAHP. 
- I am an equal contributor in terms of home labour: I do all the grocery shopping and cooking, up and dress LO every morning, and do dinner bath and bedtime every day. 
- He has every Saturday for some time to rest/sleep in/see friends (I also have Saturdays to spend time with my LO which is very important to me.) Sundays we spend time as a family. I don’t really have that same kind of “me time”, but my husband and I discussed it and it’s just how it is for now. We both know that the SAHP has it rough and needs a break from the LO, and so it works to have him feel more refreshed after some time to himself. Hopefully in time I will be able to have a day or some time like that, but for now I want to spend the time I am not working with my LO. I am not trying to be a martyr, I’m just trying to be a good provider and a present mom, which as all parents know is hard to balance with some me time too. 

- The work trip was a very far and costly flight. It would have been financially crippling to cancel. Under normal work circumstances I would cancel work or take a few days off (even though it’s not a luxury a small business has, I have definitely done it in the past to prioritise my family), but this time was just bad timing 

- I apologise if I sound whiny about the airport. For context the lead up to the trip looking after my LO while working, with no assisted or daycare, was exhausting (I don’t know how single parents do it), and the trip itself was exhausting. It was a 14 hour flight home, and airport to home required multiple forms of transport. I am pregnant and honestly just couldn’t face 2 trains, a ferry and the walk with my suitcase. I had hoped that having had 3 child free days to recover, that my husband might, even if he wasn’t feeling 100%, might be able to give me some empathy. I wouldn’t have wanted him to drive if it was dangerous. But really, just wanted to illustrate my frame of mind when I got home. 

- LO couldn’t stay an extra night at family, just wasn’t possible. 

- I didn’t shout at my husband like a lunatic. In and among getting LO fed, bathed, and getting things done at home (dogs not fed etc), my husband, laying on the sofa and playing video games complained that I was not being very tender and giving him TLC. To which I got snappy and asked why he hadn’t eaten, if he was dehydrated, why he hadn’t gone to the doctor when I arranged my aunt to take him 

- I know there’s no cure for a tummy bug, but I encouraged him to go to the doctor because I was concerned for his well being and worried that the severity of how he felt could mean something worse than a tummy bug and he might need medical help. He described how he felt as so severe that I arranged family to cancel plans to look after LO, got an aunt to cook for him, go check on him, and offer to take him to the doctor. Yet he didn’t do basic things to responsibly care for himself. The man I saw when I got home had a tummy bug, not a life threatening illness. 

- I am not saying he shouldn’t have had that time to recover: I was glad he’d had some space to rest, understood why he felt too tired to fetch me from the airport. It was him complaining I hadn’t given him TLC, when I felt I’d done everything I could.

3,1gc1o5i,AITA for not going to our friends destination wedding? ,"AITA for not going to our friends destination wedding?

My boyfriend has a long time childhood friend who got married recently in a different country, and we didn’t go. For many reasons. 

1. We just had our third child. We can’t just leave our very small kids for a week right now. Especially since I breastfeed. That would take too much work to pump enough for a week and I wouldn’t be able to enjoy myself thinking if I pumped enough or not. And no, we wouldn’t want to take all 3, and you’ll see why next. 

2. We can’t afford it. Nor can we just take time off work. My boyfriend works for a small company and for himself, he doesn’t get paid sick/vacation. 

3. We have been together for over a decade, 3 kids together and still “dating.” He says the only reason I don’t have a ring is because we can’t afford one yet, and he wants to get me something I deserve. If we can’t afford that, we can’t afford to go to someone’s destination wedding that would cost us $2k+. 

4. We live on the east coast USA and his friend wanted to go to Las Vegas 3 weeks before the wedding for his bachelor party, which is crazy to me. Nobody could go to both so Vegas was cancelled. His friend has no kids and him and his now wife make really good money, so they can do things like that.


I found out none of their mutual friends went, and they were all supposed to be in the wedding. A few others also just had a baby this year, and I know a few others who were invited and they didn’t go either, not sure why but I know they all have family and kids too. He didn’t end up going to Vegas because again, nobody could go. He thought everyone would be excited for Vegas but truth is, nobody could go to both a destination bachelor party and wedding, nvm 3 weeks apart. I believe he tried planning a night out at a casino a few hours away the weekend he wanted to go to Vegas but my boyfriend already had work planned for that weekend so he couldn’t go, but neither did their other friends. 

The wedding was a few weeks ago and I saw that my boyfriend has sent him a few texts already apologizing and congratulating him, but he’s getting ignored. My boyfriend now feels bad about it and says we are assholes for not going to his friends wedding. I’ve always been told if you have a destination wedding, don’t get mad if people can’t make it. They have their own problems and not everyone can just put everything on hold and go on a whole ass vacation just to go to your wedding. I have close friends who are planning weddings in different states and if I end up being able to not make it to them, then so be it. We have other things to save up for too like a house and a second car. It really sucks but that’s life.

4,1gc1g5f,AITA for confronting my dad about eating all of the jam I bought with my grandma without me?,"I (20m) recently came home from a trip where I visited my grandma and some extended family where I brought home some gifts for everyone in my family. I also bough myself some jam me and my grandma found being sold at a fleemarket she took me to during my visit and I was really looking forward to eating it since it's made from my favourite berry.

I put it in the fridge alongside a different jam I had bought for my dad that's made from his favourite. I specifically told my dad and the rest of the family that the first one is mine and to not finish it without me, otherwise they were welcome to have some.
When I came home from work a few days ago and looked in the fridge because I wanted some I found the jar empty and I got really upset because I was looking forward to having it and hadn't even gotten to tasting it yet so I called up a friend to vent about it (this friend and I have a thing where we will rant to eachother about anything as having someone to listen is kinda therapeutic for us).

After calming down I got really sad because the jam was kind of sentimental and not something I could just go and buy again since my grandma lives more than 10 hours away from where me and my family live. Not long after my dad walked into the kitchen so I asked why the jam was empty and he told me that he and my sisters had ate it for dinner last night (just some scones/bread with jam (Typical lazy dinner in the family). I then got upset again and asked him why he had thought it was okay to finish the jam without me when I had specifically asked him and the others not to (I had even taped a note with my name on it). He said it was my fault since it was in the fridge and that if I'm going to so upset about it then maybe I shouldn't be allowed to eat from what my parents buy in for the family at all either.

I don't understand why he decided to escalate that far and feel hurt and disrespected because he didn't care that I wanted to eat my own jam despite having bought one for him (his is still untouched..)

5,1gc0yqj,AITA for not texting my bf ‘enough’ when I’m out with my friend?,"So this just happened while I (19F) was out with my best friend (20F) and her new boyfriend who I just met for the first time. I didn’t really had time to text my boyfriend (19M) that much today, I had an exam and after it I had schoolwork to do so I was busy. After school I texted my boyfriend the plan I told him where I am going with who plus he sees my location so I didn’t think that much of it. 

I think it worth mentioning that he has really bad trust issues, but he always says that I’m the first one he actually trusts. We were long distance couples and we have been living together for 2 months now. While we were dating in long distance he logged into my insta and read all my convos with other, viewed my entire like, comment and story history and basically questioned everything. After all these we had to go through my facebook friends on call with my screen shared, tell him who is who what are they to me and how I know them and unadd them if he didn’t like them. After the same with my snapchat friends. When we moved together and school started he went through my entire discord account and every single chat every single messages and then he questioned everything again. To this day he still reads every message I send to anyone and reads every message I get. If I get a notification he instantly asks who and/or what is it. There were times where I had to send a photo where I am what I’m doing with who while he could see my location. And now he is surprised why I think he doesn’t trust me.

So we were an hour in just talking about casual things and I texted him back that we are still in the cafe and talking. After this he got so angry and said things like he doesn’t worth a minute of my time and things like this just because I didn’t try to text him back instantly every time he texted me. Then the argument went into me not trusting him (there was not a single minute of our relationship when I didn’t trust him) and that he is trying to change so much for me (I believe him that he is trying but I don’t see any changes yet which is okay changes are not instant) and again that he doesn’t worth to me a single text or minute of my time (like I said we live together). He always tells me that he trusts me but obviously it’s hard for me to believe that after all that happened but today i tried to trust him with not texting him every move of mine but this happened.

Am I the asshole for not texting more to my bf because I tried to believe that he trusts me and am i the asshole for believing that he still doesn’t trust me?

Update: 
He lives with us, my family and I so removing him would be easy.
I confronted him about this and demanded my privacy, made him log out of all my accounts and I changed the passwords of the accounts he knew the passwords to. I told him that if he really trusts me he will be able to show me it now. 
If this works for now but the same thing will happen within a few weeks I’m gonna talk to him again and tell him that if there’s not gonna be immediate changes he will need to leave and before telling him this I will obviously talk to my parents about it.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-25,"AITA for not texting my bf ‘enough’ when I’m out with my friend?

When we moved together and school started he went through my entire discord account and every single chat every single messages and then he questioned everything again. To this day he still reads every message I send to anyone and reads every message I get. If I get a notification he instantly asks who and/or what is it. There were times where I had to send a photo where I am what I’m doing with who while he could see my location. And now he is surprised why I think he doesn’t trust me.

So we were an hour in just talking about casual things and I texted him back that we are still in the cafe and talking. After this he got so angry and said things like he doesn’t worth a minute of my time and things like this just because I didn’t try to text him back instantly every time he texted me. Then the argument went into me not trusting him (there was not a single minute of our relationship when I didn’t trust him) and that he is trying to change so much for me (I believe him that he is trying but I don’t see any changes yet which is okay changes are not instant) and again that he doesn’t worth to me a single text or minute of my time (like I said we live together). He always tells me that he trusts me but obviously it’s hard for me to believe that after all that happened but today i tried to trust him with not texting him every move of mine but this happened.

Am I the asshole for not texting more to my bf because I tried to believe that he trusts me and am i the asshole for believing that he still doesn’t trust me?

Update: 
He lives with us, my family and I so removing him would be easy.
I confronted him about this and demanded my privacy, made him log out of all my accounts and I changed the passwords of the accounts he knew the passwords to. I told him that if he really trusts me he will be able to show me it now. 
If this works for now but the same thing will happen within a few weeks I’m gonna talk to him again and tell him that if there’s not gonna be immediate changes he will need to leave and before telling him this I will obviously talk to my parents about it.",0.0,0.01917473,0,1

7,1gc0op2,AITA for not pushing for my wife to have a bigger role in my daughter’s wedding? ,"My ex and I weren’t together very long when we had our daughter Riley. We broke up while my ex was still pregnant. A year and a half later, my ex married her husband, Phillip. Riley was with me every Tuesday and then every other weekend, with split holidays. As she lived with her mom and Phillip more, he became a father figure to her. She doesn’t call him dad, but has made it clear she thinks she has 2 dads. I have never been threatened by Phillip and have a lot of respect for him. He, my ex, and I get along well.

I married my wife when Riley was 13. While the two of them get along, they aren’t as close as she is to Phillip. I know she doesn’t consider her another mother figure. I was also okay with this as Phillip had been in my daughter’s life longer and was around her. Riley was always very polite and considerate towards my wife. I could tell my wife was hurt they weren’t closer but I didn’t want to push the issue. My wife and I had a son together.

Now, Riley is in her mid-20s and is getting married. I’m walking her down the aisle, with Phillip on her other arm. My son is going to be a junior groomsman. My ex is being escorted by her father down the aisle as well. Riley’s siblings from her mom’s side are also in the wedding party. When my wife asked Riley what her role was, my daughter said she wanted her to sit up front and she’ll be in family photos. My wife asked about a special dress and Riley said they could go shopping together, but she didn’t care what she wears, she doesn’t have to match the bridal party or anything.

My wife is very hurt and wants a larger role in the wedding. She wants to walk our son down the aisle, but Riley said her sister on her mom’s side who’s close in age with him is walking with him as they’re a junior bridesmaid. My wife kept suggesting other ways she could walk down the aisle and Riley gently shut her down. I wasn’t here for this conversation and only found out about it later.

My wife came to me and says I need to convince my daughter to give her some role in the wedding. I say it’s my daughter’s day and I’m not going to tell her who gets what role. She’ll have the opportunity to do mother of the groom stuff if/when our son ever gets married. She said that Phillip has a big role, he even gets a dance with my daughter at the wedding (we’re splitting the song so I get half, Phillip gets the other). I pointed out that Phillip has been in her life since she was 10 months old and helped raise her. They don’t have that dynamic.

My wife is now very upset with me and says I’m enabling my daughter excluding her. I really don’t feel this is my place.

8,1gc0k8v,AITA for not stepping up to take my stepdaughter to the fun day at her art class?,"I (34f) married my husband (37m) 9 years ago. He has a 12 year old daughter with an ex (36f). They were not together when he and I met, so I'm not the OW and we all got along okay when he and I first met and when we got married. Not besties. But we could talk during exchanges and say hi if we passed each other on the street. There was no tension.

This all changed when my stepdaughter's mom was left at the alter. She had been with her ex-fiancé as long, if not longer, than my husband and myself. Once that happened she changed and she got more possessive of my stepdaughter and became hostile whenever she'd see me. She told me once it made her sick that I was watching her child grow up and that my stepdaughter and I had a good relationship. She told me it wasn't fair to her and the fact my husband and I were growing our family while she was left alone with my stepdaughter. I tried to be compassionate but she did not want to know.

And she came between my stepdaughter and me. Suddenly my stepdaughter didn't want to hang out with me. She wouldn't show me affection. Then she started getting a little rude/disrespectful when in my care. My husband was always there to talk to her and correct behavior like that... but it was very clear a wall went up between me and her. My husband talked to his ex and she told him it wasn't her problem if my stepdaughter didn't like me anymore. She said to him it was only fair since she has her.

Court was involved, but got us nowhere, and we tried therapy. It never got so bad that we couldn't be in the same house but time spent together did become impossible. It was unpleasant and it was clear my stepdaughter did not want to. Family time wasn't bad but could be tricky because she didn't want to walk next to me or didn't want to sit beside me. 

My stepdaughter admitted to me recently that her mom doesn't want us to be close and she doesn't feel she can be nice to me or close because it would upset her mom. She doesn't want her mom to see us together. But she (kind of) admitted she doesn't actually dislike me. She told me she'd never say it to a judge or anyone else because she won't get taken from her mom and she can keep lying like she did in therapy before. I felt bad for her. I told her I would never force anything on her. She just shrugged and the talk ended.

Now we're onto the current problem. My stepdaughter's art class is doing a fun day but a parent or family member needs to stay for it. My husband can't. Her mom can't. She doesn't want me to do it. But my ILs think I should and were unhappy when I told them I wouldn't. I said I won't stress her out by making her only choice me. They said I should be willing to do whatever it takes. My husband told them to stop and I was right. But they said I'm letting her mom win and letting the gap grow between us.

It’s just keep getting worse. It started of with just name calling but has gotten worse over the past few weeks. Context: She’s adopted, 
which is something we’ve always been open about and celebrated as part of her story. Recently, some kids found out about her adoption and started saying horrible things – telling her stuff like her birth mother didn’t want her. They tell her that she’s unwanted tell her she a reject. ( which is not the case her mother loved her very much to the point she literally gave her life so she could be here) 

If this wasn't bad enough 

A few days ago, she came home in tears with her hair butchered  they’d cut off 2 inch of her ponytail well in class all while taunting her names and laughing at her reaction.  They will follow her through the halls to make fun of her on a regular basis now.

Both my husband and I have been in touch with the school about the bullying more times than I can count. I emailed, called, even showed up in person to speak with teachers and the principal, but all I got were empty promises that they’d “look into it.” Nothing changed, and my daughter’s mental health has taken a hit  she’s anxious, struggling to sleep, and now begs us not to send her to school.

Finally, out of frustration and feeling like no one was taking this seriously, we reached out to a lawyer to explore legal action against both the school and the bully’s family. Only when the school and her parents learned we were considering a legal action did they start to act. Suddenly, the school calls me to say they’re moving the bully out of my daughter’s class and claim they “had a talk” with her. The girl’s parents reached out too, saying they’d “talk to their daughter” and promised it would stop.

But honestly, I don’t believe them. It feels like they're all saying this just to get me to back off and avoid the legal consequences. I worry that once the dust settles, things will go right back to how they were, and my daughter will still be dealing with this. My family thinks I should give the school and parents a chance now that they’re finally taking action, but I feel like it’s all for show.

So, AITA for moving forward with legal action even though the school and the bully’s parents now claim they’re handling it?

13,1gbyopr,AITA for uninviting sibling to MY family party?,"Sibling F/30 is the sensitive type. Very reserved. Acts like everything is always fine. But I know deep down inside, she is resentful for how she was treated by all the family during her childhood.
Recently she has been distancing herself more from most of the family. Marrying a guy no one has met. Won’t let us even throw her a party. Won’t even disclose much info about the man. Says that she will share more when she is ready.

Some of the things she says:

“I have never wished you pain nor distress, let that be clear.
While it is untrue that I dislike, much less hate, anyone in the family—for it is quite the opposite, as my consistent actions show.
I am indeed a guarded person, a private one, this is true. And integrity, character, and trustworthiness are held in a higher place than blood for me.
That is to say, I do not believe in owing someone something simply because of a blood tie or status. 
Trust is earned. Respect is given and maintained when it is reciprocated, etc.”

Like wtf is that? I think she’s read too many novels where the protagonist is this victim princess that finds her voice. This is real life, she’s being overly sensitive.

She decided to leave the family chat. And cited me and another sibling as the reason.

So I uninvited her to my annual family party to protect my mental health. Because I do not want her to come with her fake smile and acting like everything is normal. Seriously.

16,1gby2p7,AITA for having an agreement with my partner where a certain happy drug is not allowed,"AITA for having an agreement with my partner where a certain happy drug is not on the table within the relationship. (Allowed is totally the wrong phrasing)

So me (22)M and my partner (22)F have recently entered a break, I am struggling to understand why this is being classed as my fault when this was a decision she made 9 months ago.

So for a catchup I’ve had a really rough relationship with this drug not with personal use but through witnessing what damage this drug has and will cause. Around 9 months ago she decided to try to drug much against me feelings on the subject, neither of us came out in the best light in the scenario and it blew up the fallout lasting around a week, after that she had agreed upon that not being in the relationship for my peace of mind on the subject, not closing the door on other options in the area just this specific door. The happy typical rave drug is still a massive trigger for myself to be around. I don’t want it in my life. I know the stress alone of Maria taking it will kill me. 

So now we are 9 months into the future and things have been great we have grown a lot together from before. Then she decided to drop a bomb on me by saying that boundary is unfair and she wants to take it again because she is familiar with it and feels like it is safe. She wants my support on this but I just can’t bring myself to do that. It simply hurts too much. She asked me if she took it again would I break up with her. I answered honestly and said yes, i do admit I regret saying that but the truth is I do mean it I gotta prioritise my own mental health here. I want nothing but her safety here and I don’t want her to get hurt just because she wants to party. She believes this boundary is controlling. She feels like I’m infringing on her freedom, she accepted this was the terms of our relationship 9 months ago. I want to be with her but she wants me and the option to take this drug. I am lost. I am battling between my heart and my brain. I love her. I mean that with every fibre of my existence but I swore to myself to not let that drug into my life whatsoever. She wants a break for the weekend and to talk on Monday to hopefully find some middle ground. I am on the strong stance of it’s me or the drug simply because it’s triggering to be around and it feels like she’s picking the drug here.

18,1gbxd0b,AITA for asking MIL to Postpone a Visit?,"Backstory - my parents house burned down in the TX fires in February. They did not have insurance and lost everything due to quick evacuations. My brothers and I all offered them a place to stay, but logistically it made the most sense for them to stay with me since I had an extra room. I called hubby to discuss before I offered the room, and he said of course they could stay. They stayed for nearly 6 months while getting new docs to get an apartment. My mother has a history of script abuse, hypochondria, Munchausen, depression, anxiety. My dad has had 2 strokes, diabetic, gastro issues, and early onset dementia. It was a rough 6 months for everyone. I used all my PTO to get them settled, so long weekends are all I get for the rest of the year.

Tuesday before Labor Day, my MIL told my hubby she wanted to come visit that weekend. He told me this right before we were about to have sex so I didn't say anything for fear of ruining the mood. On Wednesday, I woke up not feeling great but wrote it off to allergies. I felt worse as the night went on and asked if his mom could postpone the visit until the following weekend. He got furious and said things like ""Why do you hate my mom?"", “I already told her she could come"", and “I hope none of your sons have a wife that doesn’t like you” and “your parents lived with us so she can come if she wants”. I explained that I felt awful, I needed rest, and it was short notice anyway. It turned into a HUGE fight lasting for days and came up again yesterday. Turns out I had Covid so she didn’t come anyway.  

My parents living with us keeps coming up, and his thought is that my parents lived with us so his mom should be able to visit anytime she wants. We have had this fight countless times over the years because his parents would show up unannounced and stay for days. I don't mind that she visits but do mind not having a say in when and with what frequency. Prior to her call at the end of August, they had visited 3 of the past 4 weeks in July. MIL used to visit almost monthly and stay for anywhere from 2-5 days, on a few occasions up to a week. Before the fire, my parents visited about every 6 months and stayed for 2-3 days. His family has spent more time visiting even with my parents living with us for almost 6 months. He is very close to his family and my relationship with mine is strained due to my mother's many issues. He won’t let go of this fight, and I won’t cave about him putting her wants above my needs. Yesterday he said again how he hopes our sons don’t have a wife that doesn’t like me, but 2 of our boys are married and I have a good relationship with their wives. I would never show up at their door expecting to stay without advance approval from both.

He had a daughter with the other woman a year ago.

Now their daughter was taken by CPS and is currently sitting in foster care.

My grandparents, dad's parents, want my mom to raise her so we will know her and so she will have us growing up. Mom said no.

My guess is they want us to meet her so we'll ask mom to raise her.

Mom did get a call and was asked if she would take her by a social worker but her no was the last contact we had with the social worker. We only had contact once before that where we/she was asked if visits between us and the girl were wanted. They weren't.

My mom tries to keep me and my sisters out of it but I have heard her lose her cool and answer the phone to tell my grandparents to leave her alone. I also heard my grandparents call her names and remind her over and over that my sisters and I are related to this girl and mom should want us to know each other and be close.

I heard mom cry the other night so I called my grandparents and told them to leave my mom alone. They tried to defend themselves but I told them to stop. I brought up them calling my mom cruel earlier that day and I asked them how they could be cruel. I asked why didn't they take their granddaughter and why do they want her to be somewhere she's not wanted or loved or cared about.

She’s had a bit of a rough time financially since then, so she’s really embraced the “simple life.” She often talks about how she doesn’t need much, how money is a distraction, and how “having less is freeing.” 

My kids are 11 and 12, and Lily’s started babysitting them sometimes. But I’ve noticed that after hanging out with her, they make little comments like, “Why do we need a big house?” or, “Why buy new clothes if we don’t really need them?” To be clear, I’m all for teaching gratitude, but I also feel it’s important for my kids to see that success and comfort don’t have to be negative things. I didn’t grow up with much, and my husband and I worked hard to build our life so that our kids could have opportunities we didn’t have. I don’t want them feeling guilty for what we have, but Lily’s influence seems to be making them second-guess our lifestyle.

When I asked her (as gently as I could) to stop making these comments around my kids, Lily was hurt and said I was “trying to erase her reality” and accused me of being “materialistic.” She said it’s her duty to show them the world isn’t all about money and things, which I get, but I think there’s a line between that and making them feel uncomfortable about our lifestyle. The conversation got heated after Lily called me materialistic and I snapped and told her to “just stop playing poor.”

The icing ranges from just being plain glazed from slight drizzles to having it all over with sprinkles.

I took the doughnut with a drizzle of vanilla, it was the only doughnut I had. It was a single thin drizzle and my mom got on to me about it my sister even joined in. There were at least 3 other doughnuts with vanilla icing on them, 2 with sprinkles one without. I pointed that out but no that wasn't their point, the point that I was inconsiderate for taking it at all. If I knew it would've been a problem I wouldn't have eaten it.
 It also just bothers me for other reasons too :

1. We've brought these before plenty of times and neither have had problems with me getting vanilla doughnuts before.

2. My sister has also been inconsiderate with it comes to snacks. There have been cases where she hogs a bag of chips and gets upset when we eat some, though she has gotten better about this.

22,1gbwmdf,AITA for telling off my mother-in-law at a restaurant?,"I've (22F) been married to my husband 'Jamie' (23M) for just over a year. I feel like it's somewhat relevant to mention that we dated for two years before we got married and have had a really happy relationship beyond the usually little issues that everyone has in relationships. He's never cheated, etc. His dad has never been in the picture and his mum, 'Hazel', raised him. He's an only child. She's always been very protective of him (which I get and think is reasonable) and has never loved me and but has never been actively odd with me the way that she has been recently.

Yesterday we all went to a restaurant because it's Jamie's birthday this weekend and she's going away that weekend to Lanzarote with her new boyfriend. We couldn't do today and so we agreed yesterday was the right option. It was a pretty upscale place, but not like the Ritz. Jamie and I arrived there 7.25 when the table was booked for 7.30, we got a couple drinks and settled in. Hazel rocked up about five to 8. It frustrated me but she's almost never on time so I'm used to it.

We ordered and got through starters okay, she mostly talked to him through it, and when she got her main (she ordered a kind of chilli) made a big deal about it being ""freezing cold"". I don't mean to be rude but I could literally see the steam coming off it so I doubt that it was. She sent it back and got a new one, and then through the dinner kept saying she was so frustrated she couldn't have been there on the day (she booked the holiday like two weeks ago... does she not know when her son's birthday is??) and then she looked me directly in the eyes and said ""You know, it's just so hard to keep track of all these birthdays when you have so many other important things to think about. When even is your birthday?""

I was annoyed from waiting and being left out of the conversation etc and honestly just sick of her shit. I told her that if she really cared then she would have not booked a holiday on his fucking birthday, or show up on time for this dinner, or at least she wouldn't keep going on about annoyed she was that she had done it and she'd just apologise and tell him that she'd leave him a present and call him on the day. Clearly she had more important priorities. She looked shocked and told me that I was being out of line, and looked to Jamie to defend her.

Jamie and I left shortly after because I was frustrated. Hazel is furious about what I said but Jamie's hesitant to pick a side and says that we should both apologise to each other.

23,1gbwdps,AITA for asking to not miss feeding the dogs,"I recently tried talking to my brother-in-law (BIL) about how he and my sister forgot to feed their two dogs. My family has always been dog lovers, though BIL isn't. Since they got married and moved next door, the two dogs, who used to stay with us, have been living with them. They sleep in the garage now, as BIL doesn’t want them inside. The garage is covered, but rain still gets in, and one dog loves getting wet, so keeping her dry has been a challenge. They quickly become smelly from the dampness, and while BIL washes them at home, the smell returns. Recently, one dog has had dandruff, shedding, and skin redness—something we know happens when she's not kept dry. Additionally, their meal schedule has changed from twice to once a day, and the smaller dog is often bullied out of her food.

My sister, a doctor, sometimes has critical cases requiring her full attention, and at times, they forget to feed the dogs. Today, they missed feeding them for over 24 hours, so I decided to address it with BIL, as my mom had already talked to my sister. Here’s our conversation (translated):

Me: ""Hey, BIL, there was no food left for the dogs today. I feel bad for them.""

BIL: ""Your sister has critical patients today. They can still eat later since they only eat once a day.""

Me: ""It’s hard for dogs to eat at different times.""

BIL: ""It's harder when patients die.""

Me: ""They’ll be hungry in the morning.""

BIL: ""They're just dogs.""

Me: ""It’s easy to leave food for dogs. Their welfare is part of our responsibility.""

BIL: ""I don’t like talking about these things.""

Me: ""For you and my sister’s consideration, please keep the dogs' welfare in mind.""

He didn’t reply, and later my sister messaged me, upset. She said I was being ""hurtful"" to BIL, reminding me that his sister passed away due to an illness last year, which makes him sensitive. She argued I was making a big deal over missing one meal when they were dealing with critical cases. Although I understand, I still think we shouldn't neglect our responsibilities to pets. My sister insisted they care for the dogs in their own way and that I don’t have the right to dictate this. I pointed out that one of the dogs is sick again, and they forgot to feed them again. I believe there’s always a way to not miss the dog's feeding had they wanted to.

Things escalated. My sister said I should have spoken to her instead of BIL, who has now blocked me. She now refuses to go on an upcoming family trip. She even asked me to ""choose"" between them and the dogs. I was shocked by how easily she disregarded our family, and I didn’t expect a simple discussion about caring for the dogs would blow up like this.

Edit for info:  
The dogs were moved because one of our male dogs was no longer getting along with them. BIL drives my sister for  work.

I (28M) had my 6 yo nephew for the day. The plan was to take him to the movies but there were only two options for us to see; one of the movies he’d already watched, and we tried to make it to The Wild Robot but lunch took longer than expected so we wouldn’t get there in time. I realized the aquarium was close to the restaurant we were in, and he told me he’d never been. 

Full disclosure: I was vaguely aware that my sister (34F), his mother, doesn’t support zoos and is against places that keep animals in captivity, though it was never a deep discussion between us. I didn’t know if aquariums were also “off limits” for her, and I didn’t check. The boy was excited after all!

My nephew absolutely loved it and at the end of the day I sent my sister some pictures of him seeing the fish. Her response: “I can’t believe you did that”. And later when she came to pick him up she gave me an earful, like I was trying to be the cool uncle and disregarding her parenting decisions.

I was very upset by that. I was able to take him for the day when her babysitter bailed on them, I took him to a nice day out with all expenses paid, and instead of a thank you I was treated like a transgressor.

My mother has a strained relationship with many of her siblings, and in these final years they have all had many squabbles over my grandmother's care and estate planning. Some of them have not been on speaking terms for years as a result. Shortly after my grandmother passed, all of the siblings got together to finalize the arrangements; according to my mother it did not go well.

Initially my mother told me that it was completely up to me if I came to the funeral as she was feeling quite negative about how everything was being planned. It's a 5 hour drive from where I live and in the middle of nowhere, but I said that I certainly planned on attending, my grandmother was big part of my childhood and I wanted to be there. My mother said that was nice, but I definitely didn't need to bring my family all that way (I have 2 young kids).

We spoke a few days later, and she truly wanted me there for support despite initially saying she didn’t care.  I reinforced that I definitely planned on coming, and would likely bring my family with, even though it would be a little logistically challenging since it's such a long drive and in the middle of nowhere. She said that either way is perfectly fine with her.

28,1gbuim2,AITA for not supporting my sister after our niece/her stepdaughter talked badly about her publicly? ,"The title might be confusing so let me explain. All names are fake btw. I have two sisters. Jenna (39f) is the oldest and Kate (36f) is the middle. I'm (28f) the youngest of the girls in our family. Jenna started dating Joe (40m) in high school and they got married at 20 and had their first child 3 years later. Together they had Belle (16f), Kai (14m) and Sorin (13m). When the kids were younger Jenna learned that Kate and Joe were having an affair. She kicked Joe out and disowned Kate from that day forward.

The kids were all at least a little aware of the fact dad and Aunt Kate were together too fast for it not to have started when he was married to mom. It ruined Kate's relationship with the kids. They were close before. And Jenna was always glad that they turned against Kate and didn't turn her into mom #2. Kate and Joe ended up getting married and Kate tried to pretend like she was now just a stepmom to the kids, or more like a second mom.

I sided with Jenna and made it clear to Kate that I thought she and Joe were so gross and even if they hadn't done Jenna dirty, which they did, they made life so much more complicated for the kids.

Of all the kids Belle is the most vocally and clear against Kate. She has told Kate she hates her, she has made it her mission to make Kate's life hard every time she's with her and Joe. She doesn't ignore the fact her dad is to blame but he's far less interested in healing his relationship with his kids. But Kate cares a whole lot from what I have been told. I don't really see or speak to her anymore. But I'm close with the kids and other family members see them together sometimes. Anyway, Belle has really given Kate a hard time and it bothers Kate. And until recently she thought she could win them around but then she found out that Belle had spilled publicly to friends, friends parents, people at school, and people in Kate's life who she works with, that Kate and Joe had an affair and Kate and Jenna are sisters. People have seriously turned on Kate and it hurt her at work socially. She's also being snubbed more in general. 

Kate was hurt and tried to come to me for comfort and advice on ""what to do"" re Belle. But I told her she should talk to our brothers (33m and 30m) or someone who does support her.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-25,"AITA for not supporting my sister after our niece/her stepdaughter talked badly about her publicly?  The title might be confusing so let me explain. All names are fake btw. I have two sisters. Jenna (39f) is the oldest and Kate (36f) is the middle. I'm (28f) the youngest of the girls in our family. Jenna started dating Joe (40m) in high school and they got married at 20 and had their first child 3 years later. Together they had Belle (16f), Kai (14m) and Sorin (13m). When the kids were younger Jenna learned that Kate and Joe were having an affair. She kicked Joe out and disowned Kate from that day forward.

The kids were all at least a little aware of the fact dad and Aunt Kate were together too fast for it not to have started when he was married to mom. It ruined Kate's relationship with the kids. They were close before. And Jenna was always glad that they turned against Kate and didn't turn her into mom #2. Kate and Joe ended up getting married and Kate tried to pretend like she was now just a stepmom to the kids, or more like a second mom.

I sided with Jenna and made it clear to Kate that I thought she and Joe were so gross and even if they hadn't done Jenna dirty, which they did, they made life so much more complicated for the kids.

Of all the kids Belle is the most vocally and clear against Kate. She has told Kate she hates her, she has made it her mission to make Kate's life hard every time she's with her and Joe. She doesn't ignore the fact her dad is to blame but he's far less interested in healing his relationship with his kids. But Kate cares a whole lot from what I have been told. I don't really see or speak to her anymore. But I'm close with the kids and other family members see them together sometimes. Anyway, Belle has really given Kate a hard time and it bothers Kate. And until recently she thought she could win them around but then she found out that Belle had spilled publicly to friends, friends parents, people at school, and people in Kate's life who she works with, that Kate and Joe had an affair and Kate and Jenna are sisters. People have seriously turned on Kate and it hurt her at work socially. She's also being snubbed more in general. 

Kate was hurt and tried to come to me for comfort and advice on ""what to do"" re Belle. But I told her she should talk to our brothers (33m and 30m) or someone who does support her. I told her I wasn't going to be able to give any good or helpful advice and that she's just dealing with the consequences of what she did to our sister. She told me I could still be a better sister to her instead of refusing to offer my support. She said no matter what we're still sisters and she did nothing to me.

30,1gbtb5h,AITAH For almost getting in a car accident?,"This is the event in the way I genuinely remember it. My car is 4 wheel drive and good with most terrain. I was driving down the highway after a snow storm going roughly 45 miles per hour. It was early morning so the roads were a bit icy but I felt safe because I was following the flow of traffic. I left a large space cushion between me and the car in front of me. I would say at the very least 6 cars worth at minimum. The roads up until this point were decent for a post snow storm.

I saw several of the cars ahead looking to have crashed on the side of the road. I started to slow down but apparently this wasn't enough to start to slide. I would guess that I was going 35 miles per hour when I started to slide toward the first car that was crashed. I was able to not panic and steer my car away from the crashed car while sliding. However this turned my trajectory towards another crashed car. I was again able to steer my car while sliding in the other direction. I was then able to regain control of the car and safely made it to my destination.

- I admit I should have been going slower.
- In hindsight I should have left more room between me and the car infront of me to get more time to react.
- There was 5 or so cars in close proximity driving down the highway. Multiple others crashed including the one I was following.

Unknown to me the first car I almost hit was my friend. I was admittedly still high from the adrenaline and excited that I was so lucky. I was amazed how I reacted and was telling a friend at my work about it. My other friend who had crashed and I almost crashed into was late to work. I thought it was because of the snow storm but only later learned about her accident after I excitedly told her the story.

She seemed to me to be irritated at me when she told me it was her in the other car. I was at first thrown off. She said I was going down the highway at 70 miles per hour and almost killed her. I did admittedly to my mistake say she was over exaggerating but that was mostly because I know I wasn't going 70 miles per hour. People can die though in even smaller accidents so I shouldn't have invalidated her feelings on this. 

After processing this I did apologize saying I should have been more careful. Many months later though the conversation in our friend group comes up about who is the worst driver. I get called one of the worst since I almost killed her. I again got defensive when they said I was going 70 miles an hour down the highway and giving what I feel was an unfair characterization of me. Apparently that made me a gaslighter and my friend threatened to leave if I did not admit to my mistake. I just wanted to keep the peace so I apologized. 

I just want some outside perspective on this please. These are the events from memory to the best of my ability to recall all the details.

TLDR I was driving at an unsafe speed but was able to avoid a crash by taking hasty evasive action. However, the car I almost smashed into was my friend’s car. I didn’t stop and kept heading to work. My friend is mad at me. Am I the AITAH?

My dad dropped out my engagement party last minute with covid. I heard from my brother he went to the pub that day, but I didn't confront my dad because I didn't want to get my brother in trouble for telling me

I didnt want my dad to speak at the wedding, but I heard from my brother he was expecting to, so I asked him to speak. He asked my brother to write the speech for him with ChatGPT. He sent it to my bridesmaid the week before (on my request) and she said it was ""short and lacked detail"" (she's super polite)

My dad didn't turn up to my courthouse wedding. He said it was because him & my brother had an argument the evening before about the family business, not me. According to my brother, my dad said not to drive him the next morning. According to my dad, my brother drove off without him. My dad has a car and sat nav, but said he isn't confident driving 2 hours & didn't know the route. However he does occasionally make longer drives for work or holidays, so I am suspicious.

During my courthouse wedding my dad text my brother saying ""I can't believe what you've done. I am ashamed to call you my son"". My brother then went quiet/clocked out, because his mind was elsewhere. I don't know if my dad realises that by sending this text, he not only didn't arrive himself but he also made my brother (the only person there for me) go quiet and that also took away from the excitement of the day.

After that I told my dad I was disappointed. I said he could have asked another friend to drive, got a taxi, got a train or at least attempted the journey with his car/sat nav (if he got lost trying then I would have been understanding but he didnt try and he does make the odd long drive for work/leisure). I asked him to still come to my main wedding day but as a guest (no speech and not walking me down the aisle and no father/daughter dance). He came and ironically drove himself. I had a letter & gift for my dad on the wedding morning, but after the events I didn't give it to him.

My dad has been telling people that I am ungrateful for what he has done as a father. His perspective is that I'm his only daughter and I took away his chance to be father of the bride.

If it matters, I should add that I grew up with my mum, dad and brother. My mum died when I was 20 so she isn't part of this story. Growing up, she was our main caregiver. My dad was the breadwinner (although he didn't work more than full time hours). Today I see my dad \~2 times a year when I visit him (he doesn’t visit me) and speak \~4 times a year on the phone

When we got together properly obviously she started being more open with me and more affectionate. She told me her problems almost everyday and this wouldn’t be simple like ‘I missed the bus’, it would be the same big issue that I couldn’t solve for her or even really get involved in. I became her sort of therapist and I was already starting to lose feelings with this.

This is where I think I may have been the asshole. When it came to affection the way she showed it was very child like, saying things like ‘my little baby’ and always being very close but in a weird ish way. This made me very uncomfortable and by this moment I pretty much knew it had to end. She loved me in a way that I didn’t like and i couldn’t reciprocate the love that she gave me. So I ended things with her over text (very pussy thing to do I know) and she replied with ‘ok’. I believed she knew as I had been colder and dry, not taking her phone calls or messaging as much but this was the end of are 3-4 month relationship.

Later, in the next few days I get many messages and even a phone call from random numbers all basically calling me different names and things like that. I’m not one to care about things people that idk have said, but the cherry on the cake was when I got a message from her little sister. For context here, I had blocked her on everything so she was unable to contact me unless she showed up at my house. So I see the message and it starts with ‘it’s me (her name)’ and then a ton of abuse using things that I opened up to her about. I did end up fighting back and saying things back to her over text. This went on for an hour or so, and it was pure entertainment for me at the time. The next day she tried to do it again but by now I had thought about the situation and instead of being an asshole back I tried to calm things down and apologise for it. She kept up the abuse but after this incident it’s stopped and ended with her wanting to meet one final time. I didn’t go, telling her out right that i won’t be seeing her again.

Fast forward a few months and I’m taking to friend in our group chat, as guys do you throw a few insults around at each other, and then he starts to threaten me with screenshots that idk about. So I’ve stopped with the insults and jokes and now I’m asking what these screenshots are and if he’ll send them to me privately. Eventually they end up in the gc and they are messages with me and another girl I had a short fling with. In the gc I am the most out going when it comes to women and relationships, so when they saw messages that were a bit more saucy ig and sexual I was clowned for it. Usually I wouldn’t mind this but I knew that this hadn’t come from just her(my ex). I had told her about a few of my past experiences and relationships and she knew one of them (just there socials). And I find out that after these 2 months she’s messaged her into screenshotting our chats and then sending it to her, and then sending it to another guy and then sending it to the friend in the gc who obviously sent them to the gc. At this point I’m just a bit embarrassed and sweaty now seeing that everything had happened to fast and without my knowledge. I wanted to message my ex because I knew it was her ( the girl told me) but I decided not to.

Now tell if IATA because I’m now aware that I handled things not very well in the break up but I feel like this was overkill from her, especially getting ten or more people involved just to spite me.

The next day she tried to do it again but by now I had thought about the situation and instead of being an asshole back I tried to calm things down and apologise for it. She kept up the abuse but after this incident it’s stopped and ended with her wanting to meet one final time. I didn’t go, telling her out right that i won’t be seeing her again.

Fast forward a few months and I’m taking to friend in our group chat, as guys do you throw a few insults around at each other, and then he starts to threaten me with screenshots that idk about. So I’ve stopped with the insults and jokes and now I’m asking what these screenshots are and if he’ll send them to me privately. Eventually they end up in the gc and they are messages with me and another girl I had a short fling with. In the gc I am the most out going when it comes to women and relationships, so when they saw messages that were a bit more saucy ig and sexual I was clowned for it. Usually I wouldn’t mind this but I knew that this hadn’t come from just her(my ex). I had told her about a few of my past experiences and relationships and she knew one of them (just there socials). And I find out that after these 2 months she’s messaged her into screenshotting our chats and then sending it to her, and then sending it to another guy and then sending it to the friend in the gc who obviously sent them to the gc. At this point I’m just a bit embarrassed and sweaty now seeing that everything had happened to fast and without my knowledge. I wanted to message my ex because I knew it was her ( the girl told me) but I decided not to.

Now tell if IATA because I’m now aware that I handled things not very well in the break up but I feel like this was overkill from her, especially getting ten or more people involved just to spite me. If you read this far thank you and i hope you have a great day. Love guys",,0.022729518,0,0
36,1gbryso,AITA for getting a classmate dropped in a competition and jeopardising his future after he made jokes about my mom,"The place I live is relatively affluent and there’s barely anyone in my school who isn’t upper middle class. Which makes me an outlier as im not very well off compared to them. People avoid me bcs of my family background. I know I have a pretty bad reputation but I dont get bullied per se, I just get ignored more which is fine I guess since my (16M) anxiety is really bad, I’m quite quiet and I dont really talk to anybody in school.

I had a bad year as my mom passed away and my brother was arrested so weve been struggling more than usual. I didn’t tell anyone about it except for like 2 people and the school. 

I don’t know how but people found out and word spreads around maybe through their parents. last week people started asking me about it even though none of them ever talked to me before. 

So in one of my classes the teacher was talking about incarceration and this guy raised his hand and said “i think <>’s brother got arrested recently why don’t we ask him about his experience”. I was mortified and the teacher just said that it was highly inappropriate and shut it down. I left as soon as possible but from what I heard he got scolded after that. 

At lunch I usually sit with only one other person and the next day that guy and all his friends came over and started asking me about my life. One of them brought up my mom and said that he was sorry for me but I should try to keep out of trouble and that he wouldn’t want me going down the same path as my brother. I know it sounds really harmless but I don’t know I just know that they were trying to get back at me by acting condescending. I was really mad at this point and told them to shut up. The same guy from class called me a mommy’s boy who couldn’t handle a joke and I don’t know why but that really set me off and I started crying. And then they realised they had to back off and left. 

After that I heard that they were spreading rumours that my mom was a hooker and some other disgusting stuff. I knew it was from them because they told my friend to his face. My friend told me I should report all of them for provoking me. The guy in my class who brought up my brother had really good grades and the school was planning on sending him to some competition. I knew that it would get him in a lot of trouble but I didn’t care at that point. So I followed my friends advice and reported all of them.

A week later I found out that he was kicked out of the school team and wouldn’t be allowed to compete in any events for the next 6 months. This is genuinely a really harsh punishment and I didn’t expect it to be so serious. At first I felt a little satisfied which is bad I know but alot of people have been glaring at me for days and one of his friends confronted me and told me I had such a massive overreaction and jeopardised his future over this.

Im not sure whether what I did was justified and if I was overreacting. I’m sorry if this is very long.

37,1gbrslh,AITA? I listened to a song from a tiktok where the person in it fell down the stairs and now my sister thinks I'm an AH,"I'm just gonna go straight in. I listened to  ""¿Porqué te vas?"" which is the original version (I think it is the original) from the Russian song that was used in a tiktok from 2 friends that filmed each other singing to it where one of them fell down the stairs and died, I think you know what video I'm talking about. I have seen the video and I pray for the girls and of course for the dead girls family. 
I know that the song was used for a tragic video, and like I said I pray for them. 
I like the song, especially the Italian version, but I only found this song through the video, which makes me a bit sad because I had to find out this way that this song exists.

So, to the issue. 
I listened to the song on a bluetooth box, not too loud that it would disturb others, but loud enough that you could hear it from behind my room door.
Suddenly, my sister barges in and demands that I turn it off. I was confused, and asked if it was too loud but she said that I'm disrespectful and insensitive for listening to a song that was used in a sad tragic video. I was confused since I just liked the song and it was not my intention to be disrespectful. I told her that and she said it doesn't matter its still insensitive and disrespectful.
I struggle a bit with social cues and rules so I don't know if I did something wrong when listening to the song even with my sister telling me that.

38,1gbrfdm,AITA for not defending my stepmother when my dad's family insulted her?,"My grandparents hosted a family dinner on Sunday and for a while my dad left because ""something came up"" at work for him. My sister (16f) and I (17m) were sitting with our cousins when our stepmother corrected us when we said we had big plans for Halloween and Christmas this year, because we were going to be with our maternal side of the family. She told us those plans still need to be approved by her because dad said yes without running it by her. This is when my dad's family stepped in and told her she doesn't have the right to stop us from spending time with our maternal family. My stepmother said as our mom she does, and since our maternal family never speaks to her or tries to befriend her she has the right to say they're not good for us. Then our grandparents told her she's not our mom and the more she pretends to be, the less respect she has from anyone. Then it became a situation where our grandparents and our aunts and uncles piled on her and reminded her that she didn't give birth to us, we didn't call her mom, they accused her of preying on a grieving man who was 11 months out from losing his wife when she swooped in and claimed us as hers and they rubbed it in her face that neither my sister or I actually value her or love her or want her in our lives. It became a huge fight between them and my stepmother stormed out. She tried to make my sister and me leave with her. But we refused to go with her and we said we were staying with our family.

Dad was pissed as hell when he came to pick us up and he asked me if I stepped in to defend my stepmother a woman in our family and I said no. He asked me why the hell not and I told him I didn't want to defend her and didn't disagree with everything being said. My stepmother asked why I hadn't spoken up for her and I told her because everything they said is true and I would never defend her from anything. Dad was threatening to not give us the extra time with mom's family at Christmas and my sister kinda talked him around on that because she cried to him which made him give in.

But I got lectured two days this week already about 10 years of being a stepmother deserving more respect and value and being worthy of defending. My dad told me I'm a few months away from being a man and I need to act more like one and that means defending the women in our lives, but especially the ones we love. I told him I always defend the people I love when I need to. This made my stepmother cry. It made my dad walk out of the room to calm down because his wife was crying. Dad told me I'm a bad example to my sister and the only reason she doesn't adore our stepmother is because she has followed my lead and I should think about my influence and the fact I'm risking a relationship with my stepmother in the future. 

I should add I have said similar things to her before and to my dad. But they don't really listen.

39,1gbre84,AITA for asking for my pressure washer back,"I (34f) loaned my mother (55f) my kercher pressure washer (a compact, lightweight , all accessories attach to the body type one) a few years ago and it broke during her use. I contacted kercher and they sent a replacement. She asked to borrow that about a year ago and forgot about it because I store it in the loft (out of sight out of mind, clearly 🤣)

So a few weeks ago I got my kercher out of my loft (not realising it was the original broken one) tried using it and it doesn't have any pressure. I put it back in the loft not realising and decided I'll deal with it later. Mother comes round and I tell her the kercher is broken again. She said she has my kercher ""did you forget I have it? It's been at mine for a year"" I responded with ""oooh so the one I have is the broken one. I need the kercher to clean the garden"" 

2 weeks later I'm cleaning the garden while mother looks after toddler. I ask for her to bring the kercher back round because I need it to pressure wash the floor. She responded with ""you're going to make me carry it round here on my own?"" I responded with ""I lent it to you"" (Edited to correct mistake) meaning there's surely an unwritten rule that whoever borrows brings it back to the lender, right?

For more context of the situation, my mother is fit and well, she lives 2 streets away, a 5 minute walk. She walks this several times a week to visit her grandchild.
The kercher isn't heavy or bulky.

AITA for expecting her to bring it back to me?

ETA: For a little more context, the usual situation my whole life with my mother is I lend something, and she expects me to collect it. During my upbringing I was pretty much her slave (go to the shop, go ask next door xyz, go get my xyz from upstairs, go run me a bath etc etc) so I've been made a people pleaser which, untill I became a mother 2 years ago I have realised I need to reparent myself to empower my child and not do as she did with me to stop the generational trauma.

Also, I am very active with my toddler, out every day doing something to create a routine with various learning opportunities. My mother doesn't rise untill about 1pm and by time she comes around (usually 3-4pm) - it's time for me to cook tea, after tea it's night time routine, so it's not easy to arrange to pick up.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-25,"AITA for asking for my pressure washer back I (34f) loaned my mother (55f) my kercher pressure washer (a compact, lightweight , all accessories attach to the body type one) a few years ago and it broke during her use.

43,1gbqofz,AITA for getting frustrated with my boyfriend for asking for a cup of tea right when I get out of bed?,"So, I (49F) have been with my boyfriend for eight years, and we've lived together for the last five. Most mornings, when I get out of bed to start my day, my boyfriend asks me to make him tea or a breakfast sandwich. This happens right as I’m stepping out of bed, before I’ve even had a chance to start my morning. Most of the time, I don’t mind making it for him, but it can be frustrating when I have a busy day ahead or work responsibilities (I work from home).

I usually like to dive right into my day, and when he asks for something so last minute, it sets me back 20–30 minutes or forces me to cut down on my preparation time for work. I’ve asked him to let me know if he’d like something since we’re usually in bed just talking or watching TV before I get up. That way, I would just get up earlier.

So, I (49F) have been with my boyfriend for eight years, and we've lived together for the last five. Most mornings, when I get out of bed to start my day, my boyfriend asks me to make him tea or a breakfast sandwich. This happens right as I’m stepping out of bed, before I’ve even had a chance to start my morning. Most of the time, I don’t mind making it for him, but it can be frustrating when I have a busy day ahead or work responsibilities (I work from home).

I usually like to dive right into my day, and when he asks for something so last minute, it sets me back 20–30 minutes or forces me to cut down on my preparation time for work. I’ve asked him to let me know if he’d like something since we’re usually in bed just talking or watching TV before I get up. That way, I would just get up earlier.

Let me explain. My son loves to watch youtube and im perfectly fine with that. Only now it seems to affect his personal life aswell.
Just this tuesday my son had a mini exam to test his capabilities, so i asked him if he knew everything he was supposed to learn and he responded with “yes”
But i didnt quite believe him so i quized him about it only for him to answer every question wrong and then saying he did it on purpose.
I knew it was bullshit so i told him to start learning and even offered to help him, but he said he could do it on his own. 
So tuesday he took the exam and not even an hour after school i got emailed by his school that he scored the lowest out of the entire class.
So i asked them what he got wrong and they responded with “everything”
I was furious so i confiscated his ipad and told him to go play outside with friends and to just take a break from the ipad.
My son threw a massive tantrum.
And my wife said i am in the wrong for not “fueling his imagination”

46,1gbpcmd,AITA for calling my ex bsf's boyfriend a fat ugly c*nt,"Srry for formatting errors and bad grammar, I'm typing this out on my phone at 3am.

So I 17f had a friend we'll call M. Now M has a boyfriend, who I'll call N, who I tolerated but was never close with in any capacity. 

Prior to the incident, M was kicked out of my friendgroup for spreading a rumour about one of my other close friends, and I was the only one in the group who remained close with him. however, even with this I was still mad at him and pulled away quite a bit. Part of the reason M was also kicked out of the friendgroup was because he stayed in contact with another ex friend who was abusive. Anyway, this might not be relevant but I hope it provides some context of the friendship between us? Also M is autistic if it matters, he doesn't have a lot of empathy or emotional intelligence so?

About a week before the incident, many family members and family friends had passed away at once. My uncle, my close neighbor, my other best friend's grandfather, my dog, and a childhood friend's mother. All in all, I wasn't in a great headspace, and opened up about this to M. I had fallen into a depressive episode and opening up about this stuff may sound natural, but I gen struggle to communicate with ppl, so being comfortable enough and loving someone enough to open up about ongoing mental stuff is a lot for me. I know it sounds like I'm making excuses but stay with me here.

Due to all these factors, I was very much unable and unwilling to leave the house or hangout. Whenever M asked me if I could hangout I would say no and explain that I couldn't because I either wanted to comfort my grieving dad or was feeling depressed myself. I was very VERY clear about how I was isolating myself, and not specifically targetting him to not hang out.

The night of the incident, I was having an especially bad day (the day of the funeral) and I recieved a message from N (M's boyfriend) asking me why I was ignoring (which I wasn't) and neglecting M. I was at first confused, considering the fact me and M had had a message conversation earlier that day, and that he was in fact not responding to me. That's when N clarified that he meant that I was refusing to hangout at all and was being a ""bad friend"". I tried my best to explain that I was going through a lot, and that if M had an issue he should come to me with it, especially since N and I aren't close enough to discuss any ongoing issues I have. That's when N sent a paragraph explaining how shitty of a person I am, and how my friends are awful, and how I'm stupid etc. Just went off on me, my friends, my behaviour. Now I know that doesnt justify me being aggressive in return, but please keep in mind that I wasn't having a ball that night. I once again tried to be semirespectful and explain how my issues are none of his business, but he once again retaliated by bringing up my personal life.

Now A majority of my message was well intentioned, but that doesn't matter because I still did in fact get personal in return. aka I called him a big fat ugly Cword. After the torrent of insults from N, I messaged Me directly and told him in plain terms to ""keep his bf the f away from me"". This conversation wasn't very productive, as I lashed out at M for spreading my personal information to his boyfriend and sending him to speak to me about a personal issue, especially when he knows I'm dealing with so much. M really wanted to have a productive and reasonable conversation, which I 100% can't fault him for, but I made it BLATANTLY known that I was still very upset and not ready to talk. Despite this, he insisted we call.

During the conversation with M I essentially called off the friendship then and there, bringing up prior grievances I swept under the rug for the sake of our friendship. I was also in hysterics at that point, so I was really harsh. He truly didn't understand why I was upset at him for talking behind my back and not communicating with me.

48,1gbori1,AITA For Calling Out My Step-Daughter,"Hi, I am 34 yrs old, female and my husband is 10 yrs older than me. He had a daughter when he was still in college (The mother and my husband were never married, and didn’t live together through-out their 4 yr relationship) and she is now 20yrs old.

At first, we are getting along well. Chatting and telling each other random stuffs. She lives far from us with her grandparents (mother’s side).

Then, as time goes by, I noticed that she tends to ask me (by messaging me personally) for things like branded perfumes, gadgets (iPhone), and even asked me to prepare money for her debut (back when she’s turning 18). I let these pass, but I’ll admit that I am kinda off about it.

Then recently, she asked me to buy her an expensive perfume (Le Labo Santal 33 - Cost $335 for 100ml) then mentioned that she doesn’t have money in the meantime to pay for it. I told my husband about this, we decided to just give it to her as an advance bday and Christmas gift since it is too expensive.

We sent her the perfume and days after she received the gift, she was asking for the receipt. I purposely did not include the receipt since for me, it is rude to include gift tags or receipt to your gifts. I asked her what she will do with the receipt, she just mentioned that her cousin wanted to buy the same one and wanted to know where we bought it. 🤷🏻‍♀️ 

1 week after sending her the receipt, I saw her post selling the perfume online! I called her out about this and told her that this is very impolite.

She told her mom about this and they created a group chat (me, her mom, and my step daughter) and confronted me about this. 

Her mom told me that I am crazy for accusing her daughter of selling our gift and that I am paranoid and have no proof that it’s the same perfume. My step daughter claims that she is selling her cousin’s perfume (remember her cousin who wanted to buy the same one and asking for the receipt?). 

What she didn’t know is that Le Labo’s labels are customized per purchased, care cards are hand written by those who prepared it. So technically no care cards are exactly the same. Told them about this and showed them proof and photos.

The mom then mentioned that I am just being crazy and told me that what MY HUSBAND IS TELLING HER IS RIGHT; THAT I AM CRAZY. SHE SAID THAT SHE AND MY HUSBAND ARE STILL TALKING AND THEY ARE MOSTLY TALKING ABOUT HOW CRAZY I AM. She’s also claiming that my husband cannot move on from HER, hence my husband still have their family photos (Which by the way I know and I actually the one who told my step daughter about this when she refused to see her father. I told her that her dad loves her so much and even kept their photos because that’s the only photo of him and her daughter).

Told them that I am done with them and I know that she’s blocked from all my husband’s social media since 2013 because apparently she did this before with my husband’s exes. 

I showed my husband all the messages. I told him that I won’t force him to pick my side or abandon his child, but I am done being nice with his daughter!!!

50,1gbo7m5,AITA for angrily telling my friend to stop bringing up religion?,"I (19f) have been apart of a friend group since middle school/beginning of high school. One of my friends, that I'll call Sarah, has been deeply depressed for the past two years, seeing a lot of psychiatrists, being on many different medications, and was recently admitted into a mental hospital. Through that very hard time, we all try to support her as much as possible, which includes us going to visit her at least twice a week. 

She's been in the hospital for around a month and a half now, and we've gone to visit her many times. Now, each time we visit her, one of my friends that I'll call Mary, talks about religion. For context, we were all in a private catholic school, and while some of us don't believe in God or aren't very religious, many of my friends are believers. I know it was Mary's way of trying to be supportive and to help Sarah according to what she personally believes, but it sometimes felt a bit insensitive. She would say a lot of things like ""I'll pray for you"", ""God will help you"" every time Sarah talked about struggling, when Sarah mentioned how bored she was, Mary would say ""You could read the Bible"". I know she meant to be nice and wanted to help, but it felt a bit weird, especially since we all know that Sarah doesn't believe in God and has had some bad experiences with religion in the past. 

The last time we all went to see her, which was two days ago, Sarah mentioned that it had been a really bad week and she had been having thoughts of ...... you know. When she told us that, Mary immediately screamed ""You can't do that, you'll go to hell!"". Considering the state that Sarah was in, and what she had just told us, I felt like this was the worst possible reaction. I was a bit angry at her, and looked at her and told you something like ""Could you stop bringing up religion for two seconds, not all of us care"". After that, she got upset and ended up leaving the hospital. 

While most of my friends agreed with me and think it was inappropriate of Mary to say that, some are defending her, which has created a lot of tension in our group and a fight like this is the last thing Sarah needs I think. So I tried to talk to Mary, to make things better and try to explain to her why I said what I said, but she got super angry at me and said that I was disrespecting her religion. I feel bad about all of this, partly because Mary was a good friend so I'm sad that we're fighting, but also because the situation is making it worse for Sarah. 

I really want to fix this, so if I was in the wrong please tell me and I'll try to understand and apologize to Mary. And if not I'm not sure what else I can do to make her understand that I'm not insulting her or her religion. AITA? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-25,"AITA for angrily telling my friend to stop bringing up religion? I (19f) have been apart of a friend group since middle school/beginning of high school. One of my friends, that I'll call Sarah, has been deeply depressed for the past two years, seeing a lot of psychiatrists, being on many different medications, and was recently admitted into a mental hospital. Through that very hard time, we all try to support her as much as possible, which includes us going to visit her at least twice a week. 

She's been in the hospital for around a month and a half now, and we've gone to visit her many times. Now, each time we visit her, one of my friends that I'll call Mary, talks about religion.

We come from a home with some complicated emotional trauma and emotional needs being unmet in our childhoods. Along with our youngest brother we have always clung to each other to get through things and this has lead us to be super close even as adults. So when we both went to school in the same city it, only made sense for us to live together. Mental health issues run in our family and paired with the turbulence of our formative years we both have some mental health issues, I have depression, she has anxiety. I got on medication and have been in therapy for 3 years now (only on here bc my therapist is on vacation and I can not sleep). Its been a long and hard road but I'm finally feeling free from the worst symptoms of my depression. She started meds last year, after I had to call 911 to keep her safe when she was having dark thoughts, but REFUSES to go to therapy. I don't understand taking meds, and she wants more for (at this point self diagnosed) ADHD, while not going to see a professional to deal with the underlying issues. Our dad was very anti-therapy and I can't believe shes letting his rhetoric stop her from accessing important resources. I have so much empathy for how scary it can be to talk to someone, and I know she's just fearful, but things have been changing in our roommate relationship.

I can be a highly sensitive person, and conflict makes me panic. We had a big fight and she lashed out calling me like my mother but in a calm and calculated way and it was so cruel. And recently she gets defensive over the smallest things and says something mean instead of recognizing her mistake and owning up to it. It is just hard to be around someone who is so convinced of their victimhood, while not taking any actions to grow and get better. When we were little she was the one who had meltdowns and explosions of anger and I was the one that shut down. I'm learning to feel my emotions and process them in a healthy way, but I think she now bottles hers all up and carries around that anger and anxiety all the time. She doesn't deserve that, and I don't want to live with someone who is content to be passive aggressive and building up resentment against me until we have an argument every 6 months or so. I've been telling her my experience with therapy and the way it has helped my learn about my own brain and deal with heavy emotions for years now, but she still refuses. Whenever I bring it up she shuts it down immediately and now seems pissed when I do.

I don't know how much of that actually gotten through to him or what he thought of it, as we both just cut the argument short at that point.

So AITA for letting fly at him, or is it just me being overly sensitive.",0.0,1.0229627,1,0
58,1gbmv38,AITA telling my mom that I didn’t want her brother to keep using my car? ,"I (20f) got given a car but I wasn’t driving it for a while because I didn’t have my drivers yet. While I was doing lessons etc my uncle and his family borrowed my car (for months and free of charge- I was still paying the insurance).  I didn’t mind.
Fast forward a while, I finally got my drivers. Me and my mom work at the same place, so we always end up driving to work together using either her car or mine. One day we used my car and I was about to drive it home when I saw that it wasn’t in the parking lot. I went to ask my mom where it was and she send she had let some builder (please note this wasn’t a coworker that her and I knew- this was literally some random building guy she and I didn’t know at all) borrow my car because he needed it. I didn’t say anything at work and walked home but when she came home, I confronted her her and said “the bare minimum thing to do would be at least to ask my permission, I don’t even know who this guy is.” Her reaction was to lose her shit at me and shout and say I’m selfish etc etc.

Now fast forward to this scenario now- apparently my uncle and his family have contacted her again to use my car from end of October to December. I said to her that I wasn’t really keen on them using my car since my studies end then and I’m on holiday. I was planning on using my car and doing things. She lost her marbles again and called me selfish. Then this weekend she said that she’s either giving them my car or her car to use and I must decide. 

The thing is this means we are sharing a car during the holidays which means when my mom is out and busy (using her car)  I am stuck at home. I said “whatever just let them have my car then” because I was over fighting. 
My uncle and his family came to fetch my car this evening and I went to my mom to explain that the reason I wasn’t keen on them using my car, was because now we are stuck with 1 car to share. I was wanting to go on a run (where I would drive to the place) before work and she wanted to also to a run( drive to a different place). This meant I had to skip my run and couldn’t go since she was using her car. I tried to explain this to her. I also said that I would appreciate it if they contacted me and asked to use my car instead of her.

She went absolute mad screaming and swearing saying I’m a selfish b*^ch bla bla bla and then contacted my uncle to say he needs to bring my car back tomorrow because I’m throwing a tantrum. She is giving them her car instead. I feel bad now but I genuinely just wanted her to understand my point of view on the situation and I also wanted them to start messaging me and not my mom.

60,1gbm4tn,AITA for telling my mom she doesn't love me? ,"So for context, my parents have been separated more than ten years ago and they had me when they were still young around twenty. The reason why they separated was because my mom cheated with a guy who she is married to now and have a son together. 

When they separated I was around 9 and I was sent to my grandparents' home, father side and basically grew up there til l was 20. 

I had regular contact with my mom through texting and we would see each other once a week for years until she got pregnant with my stepdad, I felt like I was just pushed aside. Deep inside, I was angry because I felt like I was abandoned.

She migrated to another country after a few years because of her parents and I stopped living at my grandparents' house because my mom wanted me to live in another state with my stepdad and stepbrother, they were nice to me and took care of me but I just felt really isolated because I was not close with them and did not know anyone in the place and had nowhere to go. 

I've had depression for years and being there just made it so much worse to the point that I wasn't able to go to school anymore, because of that l've just been playing games all day with nothing else to do and I always felt bad about that because I felt like I let everyone around me down but I couldn't do anything.


Fast forward, she wanted us to migrate with her too and I felt like I had no choice because everything was set up already even though I wasn't asked if I wanted it. 

I had thoughts that it wouldn't be good for us because of this relationship I had with her, sometimes we get along but sometimes I feel like it destroys me because she easily dismisses me. 

So recently, I had this huge fight with her because I set her off with saying she doesn't love me because she was dismissing me about something important to me. 

I told her that I felt like she just abandoned me as a child and she told me that it was years ago and why was I still bringing it up when I'm an adult already (I'm 21). She told me that she basically saved me because all I did was rot at home when I was staying in my previous house. 

She wants me to just move past all of that when she doesn't even try to understand me. I feel really isolated in this place and she told me to just go back to where I came from and honestly, it doesn't sound like a bad idea because I feel much more loved at my fathers' side and he has been really understanding with me even though I was a failure and my stepmom treated me like her own.

My mom was screaming at me throughout the whole night because she thinks it's crazy that I was still not over what happened and that I was an adult putting all the blame on her for the things that happened to me these previous years to which I didn't blame her but I did say me feeling abandoned was a huge part on why I was feeling that way, she never said sorry for just leaving me behind.

61,1gbm2at,AITA for sleeping in on a family vacation?,"I (25F) recently went on a family vacation that resulted in basically all my cousins cutting ties with me and vise versa. I was invited by a few of my cousins to go to Disney World with them, as was my fiancé. My fiancé and I took the time off from work (unpaid), booked flights, and bought park tickets.

On the first day, the plan was to go to Epcot. I decided to sleep in, and my fiancé kindly stayed back at the resort to wait for me. Once we made it there, I texted a chat with a couple of my cousins, notifying them and requesting we meet up. We never did, though we did all make plans to meet for dinner at 8 pm. However, at 6:55 pm my cousin Brad reached out to me to inform me that they were actually changing dinner to 7 pm. At that point we were in line for a ride. I communicated this. I didn't get a reply and then anxiously added that they could go without us if they wanted. They did. I had been disappointed that we hadn't met the entire day, and was even more disappointed that they decided to move up dinner.

The next day, the plan was to go to magic kingdom. I, again, slept in and got to the park later than everyone else. This time though, we were able to meet up with everyone. However, at some point after getting off a ride, everyone had left without my fiancé and I (even though we were on the same ride and they would've had to wait maybe a single minute for us). This left me extremely annoyed. After some time, I recalled that I had Brad's location and checked it only to find that they had left the park and gone to a bar without us. Hurt, I then created a group chat with all 8 people to explain that I wanted to spend time with everyone and ask that they let me know when they were doing things so that my fiancé and I could join. They were receptive to this, however, the trend soon continued on.

Additionally, we failed to get access to one of the bars we were going to meet them at because the elevator wouldn't take us to the floor and we were also late for a dinner because we let everyone else get ready ahead of us and missed the bus. We were also blamed for a prank that someone was pulling within the suite where a new victim would find a puddle of coffee under their pillow every night. Eventually, I reached out to my cousin Josh, who seemed to be the source of the hostility, to ask if there was an issue. He said our tardiness bothered him and we ended up getting into it a bit with no resolve.

On the last day, they all had dinner without inviting us. Before this I had texted to ask what they were up to. They replied ""Stuck in the rain"". When I pressed further, they doubled down and I took the hint. We left the next day early in the morning to catch our flights and I sent a text saying good-bye, expressing thanks, and wishing everyone a safe trip. A few replied.

We have had no way to get in touch with her and my parents are elderly and not in great health. I’ve not been able to give her updates on them and she’s made it clear she doesn’t care. I called her fiancé where he just yelled at me when I was trying to have a mature conversation with him. I’ve decided to cancel my room and flight to the wedding as it is no longer something I can support.

65,1gbkrr5,AITA for asking my employee to show up at their scheduled time?,"I (30f) own a bakery business. My financee’s mother (65f) works for me as the primary baker. I offer a flexible schedule and told her she could pick the hours she would like to work. Prep takes place in a kitchen set up within my home. Every week she tells me what day and time she would like to come do her baking prep work. Every week she has been late and I have never complained to her about it or made any comments. 

A few days ago she told me she would come bake at 4:30pm start. Not a problem. I got off work around 3:30 and began prepping dough for her to bake on her arrival. I turned my oven on around 4pm because it takes a while to heat up. At 4:20 she texted me she was going to dinner and would come by after. She did not give a time of arrival. I didn’t say anything to her about it. I didn’t complain. I had the oven on and time to kill so I just started doing some of the prep to get ahead of the game. I figured since she was going to be late, I might as well utilize the time I had. Financee’s mom showed up at 5:58. When she got there she asked why I was baking. I said I just figured I could get ahead of the game rather then let the dough sit. She asked me if I had a problem with her being late. I said I have no issues, I would just appreciate if the next time she could give me 24 hour notice of when she plans to come work so I can plan accordingly. 

She then said that SHE had an issue with it. I asked what she meant. She told me it was insulting that I began her job. I told her I didn’t mean any ill will by it, I was just trying to use the time I had. She told me she just wanted to get the work done and we would talk about it later. 

I gave it a couple hours and went back into the kitchen to ask if she could take a quick break and we could discuss the issue because I’d like to find a resolution if possible. I asked her how she was feeling. She told me “if I think there’s issues then I should speak first” I said “well I said I had no issues, you were the one who said you had a problem and I’m just trying to understand.” She told me again it was insulting that I started her job. She said that I told her she could pick her own hours, and if I have different expectations to communicate them. I said “I don’t have a problem with you picking your own hours. I am just asking that you could let me know when you plan to come, and arrive at that time so I can plan accordingly.” To this she said to me “well, this is how I feel. I’m not the one for this job.

My financee was in the other room listening and was as confused as I was. I went upstairs and cried. I have been close with my financee’s mom for years and have never had any sort of argument or disagreement. We have only ever had a very positive relationship.

He is Asian, there have been times when they’ve made weird little racist remarks in his presence, or about our kids. It’s minor, but it happened.

He refuses to play with me anymore and doesn't even talk about the game much with me, so I can't help but feel like I was being rude or condescending when I talked about it. So, AITA?

""I cried and almost pissed myself bc (OP) wont get off my hyperfiations (Yk what I'm talking abt, and no IDAF that I'm mad at you for ""No reason"", and no IDAF that I'm upset about it, I'm hyperfixated and it gets this bad somethimes, and ion wanna hear no sorries bc ik ya aint stoppin soon /gen)""

I don't understand why he didn't do it in DMs and chose to do it in a server with people we're both great friends with. Bit now that I know why he was upset, I can't help but feel more and more guilty.

A few minutes later, I sent a message in DMs stating that I can stop playing if he'd like, and he responded with:

""I mean, you literally went out of your way to buy VIP, showing that you were most likely getting into it to the point I was, because NO ONE I've met spends their money on a game they will never play again in their life, without exceptions, also, you stared reading the wiki and started learning more than what I knew, making me genuinely upset, not saying you were supposed to know that, but also I'm sure you were aware I was EXTREMELY hyperfixated""

When I shared my most recent one, about some item you can get in a shop, he got mad and told me to stop talking the game because it was ""his thing."" He refuses to play with me anymore and doesn't even talk about the game much with me, so I can't help but feel like I was being rude or condescending when I talked about it. So, AITA?

Update: Just about an hour ago, my friend sent a message over a Discord server with several of our other (both online and not) friends. It went something exactly like this:

""I cried and almost pissed myself bc (OP) wont get off my hyperfiations (Yk what I'm talking abt, and no IDAF that I'm mad at you for ""No reason"", and no IDAF that I'm upset about it, I'm hyperfixated and it gets this bad somethimes, and ion wanna hear no sorries bc ik ya aint stoppin soon /gen)""

I don't understand why he didn't do it in DMs and chose to do it in a server with people we're both great friends with. Bit now that I know why he was upset, I can't help but feel more and more guilty.

A few minutes later, I sent a message in DMs stating that I can stop playing if he'd like, and he responded with:

""I mean, you literally went out of your way to buy VIP, showing that you were most likely getting into it to the point I was, because NO ONE I've met spends their money on a game they will never play again in their life, without exceptions, also, you stared reading the wiki and started learning more than what I knew, making me genuinely upset, not saying you were supposed to know that, but also I'm sure you were aware I was EXTREMELY hyperfixated""

I don't like to see him mad, I really feel like an asshole for crossing his boundaries.",0.0,0.030568596,0,1
74,1gbik36,AITA for telling my mom a halloween costume wasn’t bad and to educate herself,"I am on mobile so I’m sorry if this doesn’t format correctly. 

So I (24F) just got into an argument with my mom (52F) over the costume my little brother (12) is wanting to wear for halloween. 

My mom is HEAVILY religious, when she’s not at work she is either spending her day doing bible study in her room or she is at church. She does not watch any shows or movies, if she opens up youtube it’s to watch the live stream from a church. 

She was not like this when I was growing up, but it started when I was around 19. All that to say she has basically been turning down all of the ideas my brother has for halloween. For the last few years he’s been an astronaut (of his own choice) but this year he wanted to be Jason Voorhees. My mom said no because his mask was scary. I was going over other options with him and he decided on a Plague Doctor. 

Well my mom saw it and said it was “dark and scary”. I tried to explain to her that the costume is not bad, and that it’s literally just a doctor who dressed like that due to treating patients with the plague. 

She argued that she would buy him a costume that she approved of. I told her that she would be wasting her money because she cannot force him to wear something that he doesn’t want. (side note: she isn’t even the one taking him trick or treating, our dad is coming into town and will be taking him)

I basically told her that it is not my fault that she is choosing to not understand the actual purpose of a plague doctor and choosing to only look at the “look” of the costume. She told me that “I’m your mother, you can’t talk to me like that, you should respect me” 

I NEVER cussed at her or used any foul language when telling her about the costume but it was so frustrating. I did tell her though “I’m a grown adult and will talk how I want to, but you obviously are not showing me respect either.” I also told her that i’ve done everything that she wanted up until now and i’m tired and wanted her to leave me alone. 

(note, unrelated to costume: my mom and brother are living with me and my spouse, she is not paying any rent, my parents are separated so my dad is paying her portion since my brother is here. She also argued with me for the master bedroom and i eventually gave up and let her have it). 

I feel a bit guilty since i know she’ll be up praying and crying over this.

75,1gbijm2,AITA For offering to help a homeless man but not following through?,"Just need to know if I've been a bad person and get some opinions on what I did. I was walking to the train station to go home and a homeless man was walking towards me on the stairs of an underpass. It was quite narrow so I couldn't ignore that he was there. He stopped me and said he'd had a really rough day and didn't want to be here anymore. I thought maybe he needed me to call an ambulance or mental health hotline so I stopped. I have a history of mental health issues and have wanted to stop being here in the past too, so I wouldn't have wanted someone to ignore me if I was in that mindset either.

I asked him what he needed and he asked if I could call his nan to pick him up. I asked him how I can do that and he responded with call his social worker. But then he pulled out a phone from his pocket which confused me and showed me a cup of coins so I assumed he needed money. I said I don't carry cash, but he asked to go and get some out at a petrol station ATM near by. 

At this point I didn't want to go with a stranger to take money out of my bank account so I started walking passed him. He took this as an agreement and started saying 'thank you,thank you so much'. I turned the corner to the station and froze because I realised he thought I was going with him. 

This whole time I had headphones over one ear and at this point I pretended to be on the phone to my boyfriend so I had an excuse to go into the station and not with the man. After a few seconds of him not getting the hint I said 'sorry I've got to go' and went into the station but he followed me through the open barriers, down the stairs and onto the platform. He was then getting upset and saying things like 'why did you agree to help me then take it away' 'you made me so happy then stabbed me in the back''just go back over the road, get the money out and you can still get on your train'. 

Once on the platform this carried on and he started claiming I'd help him find a bed for the night and I'd taken that away from him. I kept saying 'sorry ive got to go, I can't help' and he finally got the message. He went further up that platform and started talking to the other passengers. 

I got on my train and saw he was still there when I left. I just want to know what I should've done differently. Should I have followed through against my gut feeling or just ignored him from the start. I'm just worried if he was actually in a mental health crisis and am really unsure of if I've been an asshole or not.

76,1gbho3t,AITA? I refuse to openly help and cooperate with my stepchildren’s bio dad who hurt all of us.,"My (30M) wife (36F) have been together for four years. She has two children (17F and 14M) and I have one (8F). The biological father of the two kids has stopped visiting or being a part of their life consistently for about 8+ years now as he went to another state.

Six months into our relationship, my wife (girlfriend at the time) filed a custody case to reflect the fact he hasn’t been paying child support and doesn’t see his kids anymore since it was currently set to 50/50. The biological father went crazy and proceeded to try and come after all four of us in different ways. Called the police and tried to force the kids to leave the house with him since it’s “his week,” and even tried to yell at them over the phone claiming they are to blame for everything. He attempted to damage my reputation within the military claiming that I was some horrible person and made up stories to make my leadership talk to me about what was going on. 

Due to all of this, the daughter has refused to acknowledge his existence and wants nothing to do with him (this is now reflected in the current court orders).

This brings us to the question at hand. My wife constantly wants to include the father in things for both kids (whether it be birthdays or doctor visits) because it is “the right thing to do since they are his kids.” I have fought this to a point and have gone as far as to not answer him when he wants to know what his daughter wants for presents since she refuses to tell him. My wife and I  have been getting into arguments lately where she claims that I don’t understand what it is like to be distant from a daughter (which I do as noted above) and that I’m an asshole for not trying to help bridge the gap between them.

So. AITA?

Edit 1: I just wanted to explain the new court documents. Stepdaughter doesn’t need to see father anymore. He has not come to anything but insists on trying to buy her things and even wants us all to “go in on a gift together.” Stepson sees him twice a month for a weekend and has stated he feels he is more of a fun uncle he gets free stuff from.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-25,"AITA?

My cousin is marrying a guy (who is like a brother to me) but I noticed a few red flags, he gambles, is in and out jobs SO often, and he borrowed $25,000 from my sister and they both didn’t tell my cousin… my sister finally confessed to me before summer because she was under a lot of financial stress. She was not able to move out because of the amount of money she had lent him; she took out loans and credit card advances to give it to him.

I had told my sister she needs to come clean to my cousin because my cousin is going to marry him, and she said she wasn’t ready … I was very very stressed about this situation for my sister AND my cousin so in confidence I had discussed with cousins sisters and a close friend who is my cousins best friend as well… we all decided to just stay out of it.

Fast forward to now their wedding is next month and cousins best friend very emotionally tells me I NEED to tell my cousin because she deserves to know this information (keep in mind i’m 5 weeks postpartum and struggling alot with my mental health)… I impulsively tell my cousin, she tells me she already knew as he had already told her. I get a long paragraph from him telling me I shohld have stayed out if it and he ended our friendship, my cousin went to her best friend to vent about it and her best friend told her she already knew abiut the situation so now everyone is mad at me for discussing it with her best friend but not them.

My cousin is mad for not having faith that her man would tell me.

So I (15F) came home from school and asked my grandfather to take me to a store, if he wasn't too tired, so I could put money onto my card to buy Christmas presents for the family. He agreed to and said that he would take me in an hour.

[Necessary context: I live with my grandparents. Recently, my grandmother has been taking my grandfather's car and leaving hers in the driveway. Today, her car was gone instead of his, so I assumed that he would have his keys and be able to take me.]

An hour passed. I went outside to see him still doing yard work, so i leave him to finish for another 15 minutes. I go back down 15 minutes later, and tell him it's time to go. He says okay and that he was gonna finish his work up, so I go put my stuff on to leave.

I hear a door open and go to see what was up, assuming that he was ready to go, but it's my grandmother leading him inside. She looks at me with my coat and shoes on and asks where I was going. Honestly, I tell her that my grandfather had said that he would take me to the store to deposit so money. She makes this exasperated sigh and face and says that he couldn't go because he was too tired. Obviously, I'm pretty disappointed, and I try telling her that he said he would take me, and if he couldn't, then ask if she could instead. She rolls her eyes and says I can go tomorrow.

Now, I'm pretty frustrated, considering that she hadn't done anything but go to a casino all day. So before I can start glaring or talking back, I walk away, as I've been told to do before. I thought that was a good decision on my part because if I hadn't, a new argument would've started. My grandfather calls me while I'm leaving, but I, stupidly thinking that I was doing the right thing, keep walking away.

A while later, my grandmother comes upstairs to scold me. She says how I always make things all about me and how I need to be more understanding of other people and how I need to apologize for walking away because *that* was the right thing to do.

Before she had started scolding me, my anger had lessened. Yeah, I was still upset, but less so after calming down. After my scolding,  though, I just felt like it was unfair. I had been scolded just a few weeks ago for not promising to commit to a club that I wasn't sure I enjoy for the entire school, but now that it was someone else doing it, it was okay? It felt unfair to me.

So at this point, my grandmother has told me that I'm selfish, codependent, weak, and other things I don't feel like looking in my journal for. So many things I could say about those times, but this isn't about that.

I just wanna know: Am I the asshole?

(And don't try saying it's ""tough love"" either. She's known me for at least 10 years. Me literally bursting into tears whenever we're alone in a room together should clearly show that it's not working.)

Our family met Emily back in 2009 when she and my mom were pregnant at the same time. Shes about ten years or so younger than my parents.

My dad went out to Cali a few times while I was stationed there for work a few years back but only to visit Emily who lived about seven hours away from where I was.

I think my mom doesn’t want to fight just to keep the peace since my two younger sisters still live at home. Her and my dad are high-school sweethearts and when we were kids we knew that they loved each other so I cant fathom how my dad can live with himself doing all of these things to her. I asked her why she kept letting this go on and she just said that shes gone numb to the pain. That was the first time I ever heard my mother cry.

Everyone in my extended family knows what my dad did and absolutely despise Emily, but my sister just isn’t bothered having her there and in the wedding party.

Emily not stepping away from my family when my mother first told her to stop yknow fucking her husband is the part that my older sister just isn’t grasping. I know this is also completely on my father as well, I had to cut contact with him for a few years over it.

82,1gc6ifx,AITA for telling my MIL I don't want to spend my birthday with her?,"So my (23F) birthday is coming up and I've been planning to spend it with just my husband (24M) this year. This has been planned for a while, and is because last year on my birthday we had my immediate family and the in-laws around, and my MIL got quite drunk and made a scene about how my husband and I aren't the ""right fit for each other"" and ended up shouting some pretty bad things specifically directed towards me. 

The context for this is pretty much that she's been very hot and cold on her opinion of me, she said that she didn't like me when me and my husband were dating, has been pretty okay with me ever since. My birthday last year was the worst of it, and I wasn't going to continue making a scene over it because I'm kind of stuck with her for life and I don't want us to have a bad relationship, especially because my partner and I are planning on having kids soon and whatnot. 

This year I talked to my husband and we decided that instead of doing anything with the family, we were going to make plans for ourselves. We decided ice skating (what we did on our first date) and going out for lunch, and then some of our favourite movies and junk food for dinner. We figured that we could do a sort of all family dinner out, with my immediate family and the in-laws the weekend after or something. 

Recently I told my in-laws about our plans and now my MIL is insisting that they want to come as she did a lot of ice-skating when she was younger. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I really wanted to spend this day with my husband, especially because we'd planned it for so long. He says that he'll back whatever choice I make but that it wouldn't be unreasonable to let the in-laws come to the ice skating and lunch and then do the rest ourselves.  

I originally asked to speak to her in person about it in more depth but she told me that she was too busy and didn't want to. I feel a bit torn because I don't want to hurt their feelings, but a part of me is saying that she's just trying to make it about herself again. That being said, I know that might be unfair. AITA?

84,1gc67qm,AITA for not texting my girlfriend during a concert? ,"My (29m) girlfriend (22f) has been out of state working since August. We haven’t been apart the entire time, she’s come home a couple times, such as last weekend when she came home for a concert. Earlier this week I was also at a concert. She texted me and said have a good time shortly before I left. During the concert I got a few messages over Snapchat that I replied to and put my phone back in my pocket, only between sets. When I get home I reply to a message from her and said I’d just gotten home. She replied asking if she could call because she wanted to talk about something. She was quite upset and said that she noticed I was active on Snapchat 5 times over the 4 or so hours I was gone and never texted her. I told her I was simply replying to messages. She said she just wants me to want to talk to her. She seemed concerned about who I was texting also, so I told her the name of the buddy I was texting. This becomes a huge fight, she said she had talked to her friend because she wasn’t sure if she was out of line or not, and her friend agreed that she is not. We couldn’t come to any kind of agreement and ended the phone call, and the night on a very poor note. A couple days later I was thinking about it texted her and said I want to make sure I understand correctly, and asked her if her expectation is that anytime I open Snapchat I should text her. She replied no, all I want is for you to want to talk to me. I’ve asked a couple times what I’m doing that makes her feel as if I don’t want to talk to her and the clearest answer I’ve gotten was “So for me I know you say you don’t want to be on your phone all the time so for me I figured you didn’t want to be on your phone at the concert so therefor I said have a good time and I’ll talk to you later. But then I see you are on your phone multiple times so it’s in my head like wow he’s been on his phone 5ish times why wouldn’t he want to talk to me…”

At this point I’m not sure if I’m really not being attentive enough, or if she has unreasonable expectations of when, and how often I should be texting her.

86,1gc4w0r,AITA for wanting more than a smoothie for my birthday from my gf of one year?,"I (42 yo male) was simply taken out for a smoothie by my 35 yo banker gf for my birthday.

No gifts.

We have separate residences and she makes considerably more money plus receives extra financial help for taking care of her niece.

My family took us booth out for dinner the night of said birthday, which was a complete disaster of a restaurant experience, so we then went out again for brunch the next day.

I paid for her.

She expresses loving to receive gifts.

I give her gifts all the time, including holidays and her birthday, at which times I have really made a big effort to make her feel happy and special, but she can expect a little thoughtful gift nearly every time I visit.

For her birthday, at her request, I made an elaborate meal and cake from scratch, plus provided alcoholic beverages (I am an experienced cook and make fine dining level meals as I have worked at some very nice restaurants).

Today I was feeling bothered by the imbalance and told her that if I were to have joined the Tropical Smoothie Cafe Club I’d have gotten two smoothies from there for my birthday… and she just happily agreed.

Looking back, this has been the pace for the providing of the meals throughout our time together; I make her and her niece a nice dinner three or more times a week and provide 90% of the beverages, namely wines, mixed alcoholic beverages, juices and sodas.

Every other week she buys us a burger and fries.

This has been an ongoing frustration for me and I have been expressive about it, often resulting in her providing an extra take out meal.

Lately I’m providing more of those takeout meals as I see how much she enjoys that, but the imbalance remains about 5:1

Honestly, I’m considering this as being largely the energetic exchange rate and thinking about ending things.

Edit: She’s very verbally affectionate and talks about the future a lot. She tells me that I’m the best boyfriend she’s ever had. But still. I feel shorted by the amount of energy she puts in vs the amount of material energy I’m putting in.

I would struggle to sit in one place for not even half a minute, I just couldn't, I had to move. I don't know y but I have and annoying feeling kinda like a tingle in my legs if i dont move them often. I asked my mom if I could get an ADHD test, she said no. As time went by I brought it up multiple times and her reaction was always the same answer ""You don't have ADHD, I know people with ADHD and you dont act like them."" That's a weird thing to say because everyone is different. I talked to my friend (we'll call him Cam) about it and he looked at me and told me that he knows I have ADHD. (For info Cam has moderate to severe ADHD.) He told me that he takes meds for it and could give me one if i need it, I thanked him and went to class. A couple days later I was first period which I have with Cam.

Well being the best teacher that Mrs.B is she decided to call her, but yet again my mom just brushed it off, caring for me she decided to call my dad. My dad said that he had been wanting to take me for a long time and my mom just wouldn't let it happen, so after talking with my dad she pulled me aside again and told me to make sure i'm ready on thursday during class. On Thursday y i get there and 20 mins later i get called to leave class because im going home, I was confused but just assumed it was an appointment. I was picked up by my dad and we went to the doctors and I was hit with a bunch of questions from some dude, he even asked my dad about some. The test came back as severe ADHD, later i get home and teel my mom about it and she is pissed. She starts yelling at me and my dad and about how we went behind her back to do this. My dad snaps back telling her that this has been affecting my schooling for years. But my mom insists that its because im not working hard enough and that i dont have ADHD yet again because she know people with ADHD and i dont act like them. My dad replies again saying that if someone is depressed its not gonna be the same as your friend. My mom was at a loss for words, now that someone had pointed out the flaw in her logic.

90,1gc3x2f,AITA for not prioritizing spending time with my sister/niece,"My older sister (32) recently texted me (27) expressing her frustration that I’m not prioritizing spending time with her and my niece (12) in the last year. She mentioned that it's extra frustrating since I live nearby (rest of fam is 30 mins away) and I'm the one they are closest to. I do have a good bond with my niece, but lately, I’ve been swamped with work and a side hustle, leaving me with little free time. My niece is usually home during the weekdays and she spends weekends with her dad who lives an hour and a half away which makes plans difficult.

I feel like my family assumes that since my BF and I don't have kids we have all the free time in the world but it's  truly not the case as we both have to work a ton to be able to stay afloat. I’ve been keeping my sister at arm’s length because of her growing resemblance to our toxic mother (manipulative, narcissistic), which has affected my relationship with my niece. It sometimes feels like my sister reaches out mainly to vent or ask for unreasonable favors, and she doesn’t show much interest in my life.  I haven't communicated this to her at all because she's a mental health therapist and likes to use that as a trump card when we are having these kinds of convos.

I may be the asshole because my niece is an only child and my sister is a single mom. She has cousins but doesn't get to see them much. Our mother and grandmother plays favorites and picks my brother's kids over my sister's child so niece gets the short end of the stick frequently. My niece also looks up to me a lot and talks about mirroring her life after mine as we are very similar..

For example, I came back from the  bathroom and he said ""i thought you fell in the toilet because you’re so tiny"". He also said that ”my hair is so big it makes my head and me look even more tiny”. I am not insecure about my height nor does making fun of it offend me, but it's annoying and ironic because he's short too (looks 5'5/6). And yes I know it might be because he's interested in me, but I don't find him attractive so the teasing isn't ""cute"", it's just very very annoying. Last lab I had enough of it and basically told him to shut up because he's ""like 5'5"". He said he's not 5'5 and he's 5'9. I know I am very short but he is definitely not over 5'7. We started arguing about it so I told him I'll bring a measuring tape next class and we'll find out the truth. I started to feel a bit bad after because I know men are very insecure about their height. However him obviously lying about his height and constantly making fun of me makes me in the mood to be petty.

The only thing i could maybe agree on is the fact that maybe i could have waited until later to tell him. He argued that i didn't know if he was going to say it but that now that i told him, he definitely doesn't want to say thank you and will only say it later to his father.

94,1gc3hwz,AITA for not knowing how to comfort my boyfriend when he’s sad?,"AITA for not knowing how to comfort my boyfriend when he’s sad?

For starters, my boyfriend (20M) and I (20F) have been dating for 3 months and was talking for 3 months beforehand. We are currently doing long distance and is around a 2-3 hour drive one way. I’m the only one who can and has been driving to him almost every week for several months now, sacrificing my time and my responsibilities. 

I have dealt with many mental health issues recently and finally am prioritizing myself and my needs and that includes not driving so much as it takes a toll on me. I explained this to him numerous times and told him I cannot drive over as I’m busy (school, work, family, and my own personal space), for the next couple weeks. 

A few days ago was our 3 month and even though I told him numerous times I would not be able to drive, he still insisted I drive over as it’s our 3 month. Every time he told me he misses me and he’s sad we can’t see each other, I do try comforting him by telling him that I miss him too, I wish I could see him, and stay on call with him throughout the day since we couldn’t see each other. However, he would then follow up but saying “come over” or “you could’ve came earlier”, which leads me to reiterate multiple times that I absolutely cannot as I need to do stuff myself. I eventually do tell him maybe I could see him depending on what time my family plans end, however it is not 100% a yes. He tells me he’s aware of this.

After my family plans end, I call him about my dilemma. I’m not sure if I should come see him, I don’t have enough time, I need to study, I need to pack for my upcoming trip, I feel bad for not coming for our 3 month, and It’s exhausting if I drive. He tries giving me a solution by telling me to come over and he’ll help me pack (which does not make sense as I would have to do 2-3x as much)…… I tell him I just want comfort from him and not solutions such as me coming over because I am fed up and he has been telling me consistently for the past few days despite my busy schedule. At this point he’s upset and his tone is off and tells me “how do you want me to comfort you”. I tell him I just motivating words like “it’s okay I know you can do it” or “i’m always here for you”. 

This is where I may be the AH, he starts his sentence by saying “okay but…” and I immediately cut him off because I thought he would give me a solution again. He gets super mad at me and tells me that he was going to give me comfort but “never mind” and makes it about himself saying he was sad all day too and tried explaining that to me by saying “im sad” over and over again throughout the day and I wasn’t able to comfort him. I said I tried comforting him by saying I miss him too, and that we were on call almost the whole day, and he didn’t tell me he wanted more comfort.

He gets super mad at me and tells me that he was going to give me comfort but “never mind” and makes it about himself saying he was sad all day too and tried explaining that to me by saying “im sad” over and over again throughout the day and I wasn’t able to comfort him. I said I tried comforting him by saying I miss him too, and that we were on call almost the whole day, and he didn’t tell me he wanted more comfort. But he says that’s just the bare minimum and he shouldn’t “have to tell me what to do”.

95,1gc37ap,AITAH For keeping a cat I found?,"Hi there! I highly doubt this will get a lot of attention but I am trying to make sure I’m doing everything I can. A cat has visited my home on and off the last few weeks in my backyard, and I was able to get him in a carrier. I went to go check to see if he is chipped and he’s not chipped or neutered. I asked the lady at the desk what to do because we would love to keep him. She said to post on public forms but in the state we live in, if no one reaches out in a week he is legally ours. I went ahead and posted him on the Ring form stating to reach out, but I’ve been getting responses of people saying I have stolen him and to let him out to wander home. Our neighbor has a lot of strays and outdoor cars so I am trying to be as open minded as possible but I’m worried that winter is coming and him not doing okay.

96,1gc36pk,WIBTA if I decided to pay only half of the bill at a restaurant to which my mum insisted so hard to go with the family?,"I (24M) have been working all summer to have some money to pay for some debts I had (rent, bills and some loan from my mum) and to have enough money for me to buy stuff I needed, to go to the gym and to save for the future. We are a poor family, and whenever I have a little money I try to save something for me, but I also help my family however I can.

My mum, on the other hand, has been insisting that I invited the family (her, my sister, my sister's boyfriend and my little nephew) to a sushi restaurant for so long that I decided to accept. Tonight, my sister's bf proposed to go there in the evening, when it costs more, and suggested to split the bill between the two of us, which sounded like a good deal to me. 'cause it is, right? I get to pay less and save a little money for myself, since at the moment I am unemployed. This would be ideal, right?

Well, not for my mum. A couple minutes after that, my mum asked me ""didn't you have a budget for the restaurant? Say, a hundred euros? I think that you should still pay 100 euros, and let him pay the rest. It would be the most sensible thing to do, since they always feed you.""  
To which I answered with ""Are you kidding? You've said the worst thing you could ever say. Wouldn't it sound worse if he paid for, say, ***only*** ***one*** person, whereas I pay for ***almost*** everyone? Moreover, you're trying to use some kind of sense of guilt against me, which is completely unfair."" And she got mad with me.

I have to say, my sister oftentimes invites us (me and my mum) to have lunch at her place, since we also live in two adjoining apartments and we have lunch together. On the other hand, every time there are some groceries to buy, I go to the supermarket and I pay for the groceries myself. I never ask anyone for extra money or anything. This is why her thelling me that ""they always feed me"" sounded so inappropriate.

So, here's the question: WIBTA if I accepted my sister's boyfriend suggestion, to split the bill and save some money for myself, OR should I accept my mum's suggestion, to pay a budget (which was set by her) because I should invite the people ""who are always feeding me"" (which gets to be my sister) and let my sister's bf pay the rest?

98,1gc2u88,AITA for not being able to get past an incident with my boss? ,"I (22 F) started working for a small, fully remote marketing company 3 months ago. Last month we all got together for a conference, and I was initially excited because this was the first time I was meeting my coworkers in person. The first night was an open bar, and my direct boss Deb (48F) got wasted. I had been assigned to an Airbnb with another coworker, but before we left the CEO told us that they overbooked one of the Airbnbs and were going to drop Deb off at ours once the bar closed since we had an extra room. They dropped her off, she was blackout drunk, and got her settled into the 3rd bedroom before we all went to bed. 

I was a bit unsettled, but about an hour later there was a storm of swearing- Deb had woken up. I heard her get up and stumble around the hallway, and figured she was going to the bathroom. But then my door handle rattled over and over, then she started banging and kicking my door, screaming profanities and for me to let her in. It was extremely aggressive. Thankfully I had locked my door, so she moved onto the door of my coworker who had not locked her room. Our boss entered her room without pants, my coworker screamed at her to get out, and my boss stumbled out of her room and found her way to the bathroom. Throughout the rest of the night she kept stumbling around the halls, screaming and swearing intermittently, and rattling my handle. I was terrified. 

The next morning I demanded to meet with the CEO, told him everything that happened that night, and he literally laughed and said ""oops, my bad."" He was confused about why I was so upset because in hindsight Deb had just been looking for the bathroom, but I didn't know that at the time with how aggressive she was being. I told him I refused to stay in the same airbnb as her, and they had to shuffle assignments around as a result. Deb had no memory of the night, and when the CEO told her she just said that has never happened with her before ""but we're all still good."" No real apology or repercussions were ever given. 

The rest of the retreat felt awkward, and now that we're all back working remotely, I just can't get past how dismissed I felt about what happened. I feel uncomfortable under my boss, but the company has no HR or anyone to go to, and the CEO already made it clear where he stands. I'm looking for a new job now, but I've been told by some people that I'm being dramatic and disputes like this happen at every company. So AITA and just being overly sensitive?
