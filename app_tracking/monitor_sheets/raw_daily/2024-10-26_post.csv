0,1gcsh13,AITA for asking to bring my boyfriend on a Europe backpacking trip with my best friend?,"My best friend (23F) and I (23F) have been talking about a backpacking trip through Europe for years. We’d chat about all the places we’d go and how amazing it would be to go out there together. For me, part of the excitement was always imagining us meeting new people, making memories with others along the way, and bringing anyone who’d make the trip even more unforgettable.

Fast forward to now—I started dating this guy (24M) a few months ago, and things are going really well. He loves traveling too, and when I told him about the trip, he was all for it. I honestly thought it would be great to have him there with us. I see it as an opportunity to have some fun experiences as a group while still prioritizing time with her. Plus, with an extra person, we’d save on some costs, and I figured we could still have our solo moments in different cities, splitting off when we want some girl time.

But when I mentioned him coming along, she was really put off. She said she was looking forward to it being just the two of us and that having him there changes the entire dynamic. I didn’t expect her to feel that way, honestly, and I didn’t realize she saw this as our “best friend trip” that had to be exclusively us.

I get that she values one-on-one time, and that’s really important to me too, but to me, sharing moments with others doesn’t take away from our connection. I thought having him there would add another layer to the adventure without overshadowing our time. She thinks I’m being insensitive for not seeing why it’s a big deal, and I don’t know if I am.

1,1gcse8n,AITA for refusing to let my mother-in-law redecorate our nursery?,"So I (26F) am currently 32 weeks pregnant with mine and my husband Felix's (27M) first child. Things have been going well and one of the great things is that Felix is a builder and so everything with the nursery went pretty smoothly pretty fast! We agreed at the start what kind of vibe we wanted to go with it and it's pretty much already done. Figured that we'd get it sorted as soon as possible so it wasn't another thing to worry about later.

My MIL has always been a bit of a nightmare but has been better since the news that I'm pregnant (though not without issue - for example, she told me that I should ""lose some weight"" and that it wasn't ""heathy"" for me or the baby. She knows that I used to struggle with anorexia and I'm not any sort of unhealthy weight). In the past I've kept my mouth shut and let Felix deal with her. As the nursery has almost been completed, she's suddenly decided to invite herself around more - I work from home currently, she comes in on the regular, asks me when I'm going to have lunch and ""oh could you just pop me something in too!"" and then will wander into the nursery and start rearranging things. 

I know this sounds stupid but once she literally bought an IKEA bag full of stuff that she put in there. It doesn't match. But I've never said anything really beyond, ""Oh, thanks so much for the thought"" etc. Yesterday when she came around uninvited, she looked me up and down and said ""Really? Joggers? Thank god Felix isn't here"" and then walked into the nursery and started asking me where the pillow she'd put in the crib had gone, why I'd taken out the fairylights hanging on the wall right by it, etc. I explained that they were potential safety hazards to the future baby and that I'd taken them out. 

She started with, ""Oh, well, *I've* had three children"" and ""I really think you should take more of my advice"" and then looked me in the eyes and said ""You're really not going to be a good mother at this rate"". I don't know if it was the pregnancy hormones but I just stared at her for a moment and then told her to get out of the house. I'd been up all night and had loads of work and wasn't in the mood. She got very uptight about it and then left. 

Felix says he's going to talk to her and tell her that she shouldn't be reorganising anything without our permission, but I don't know if it was just the hormones and I'm being unreasonable.

2,1gcs60y,AITA for asking that my bsf’s bf doesn’t come on our trip?,"So my best friend (23F) and I (23F) have been planning a backpacking trip through Europe for what feels like forever. It’s been one of those “bucket list” things we always talked about in college, just us out there exploring, having the time of our lives. To me, this was going to be our special adventure as best friends—a chance to bond, be silly, and make the kinds of memories you can only really make when it’s just the two of you.

Recently, though, she started dating a guy (24M). He’s a nice guy, and I was happy for her, especially seeing her so excited. But when I brought up finalizing our trip, she surprised me by saying she thought it would be fun if he came along. She said she’d always pictured this as more of a shared experience with other people jumping in too. I get it—She’s more social than I am, and she’s never been one for rigid plans—but I feel like bringing him changes the entire dynamic.

3,1gcrwjd,"AITA? My husband doesn't want me to visit my dead childhood friend's grave anymore, I'm in disagreement.","Burner account because he uses reddit avidly.

My (18F) husband (19M) and I have always had a mostly smooth sailing relationship, he has severe trust issues and I've done everything in my power to be as open to him as I could possible be, I share my location at all times, he has access to my phone and I don't leave our home to go out partying or anything of the sort (I'm quite the introvert), I don't have any male friends which has helped his overthinking a lot, I don't dress provocatively, I don't use social media except for TikTok and Youtube, I dont even listen to male artists if he doesn't want me to listen to them.

He sits me down and tells me ""there's been something on my mind for quite a while"" which was strange because we always promise each other to be open about anything bothering us, our communication is always open and respectful. He says, ""Your childhood friend who died, I don't want you to visit his grave from now onwards.""

Some background on this childhood friend - we had known each other from our very early formative years, we were actually named similarly by our mothers who were (and still are) best friends. I'll call the friend ""M"". We were raised virtually as siblings, we ate together, we were bathed together, we were disciplined together, we celebrated birthdays and almost every holiday together, we were one big family virtually. He was like my twin brother (we were also born two days apart).

Growing up M had a lot of mental health issues and sadly he succumbed to them and took his life in 2021, the most painful part of it all is he called me and I couldn't pick up at the time so he sent me a voicemail which said ""You're probably busy right now, I couldn't reach you, I just wanted to send you my love, thank you for everything"". Next morning I walked to his house so we could leave for classes, his mum went to try and wake him up and he wasn't alive anymore. I still haven't fully grieved this loss or lived down the guilt I feel for not answering that call and I've never left the side of his mother whenever she needs me. She's a second mother to me and I always do what I can to relieve any burden I can, I love her very much.

With the background out of the way, after my husband said that, I told him that I promised his mother I would visit M's grave as often as she wanted me to and that I wouldn't forget about him. If I obey my husband's wishes, I'll be breaking a huge promise and promises are not just something I can break without them eating at my heart. He's now told me he doesn't want to talk to me for the rest of the day because his trust issues have been triggered which I understand.

4,1gcrtut,AITA for not wanting to give up my inheritance for my sister with tree kids?,So basically... I'm 22yo and living my best life. I am in a very healthy relationship. I have a small rat dog and I do not work much. I do not pay for my stuff or take care of my home because my boyfriend love to take care of me.  I am also very healthy. My sister on the other hand have 3 small children. Her home is very small and husband is total asshole. He is an emotional abuser and their divorce is in the process. She also have some body issues. I love her very much and few days ago we were besties. I was her go to person for urgent childcare and we had a really good connection. A month ago we lost our dad because of cancer. It was traumatic for everyone. Now to the issue... dad had a hause. He lived there alone. Our brother need money urgently so we wanted to sell the hause and everyone would get 1/3 of the price. My sister wanted to live in that hause. It's much bigger then hers. Kids would get their own rooms (in her hause all 3 kids have one room) and gain the huge backyard. The idea was great. Hause would stay in the family. Dad would love that for sure. She ask me to bring someone so they would decide the value of the hause. My sister thought it would be something like 350 000. I new it would be much more. It came out 500 000. She can not afford it. So we plan to sell the backyard to neighbours for 200 000 and she would give me 120 000 and my brother 120 000. I agreed to that. I asked what if the neighbour change his mind. She freaked out. She saying she can see now that I regret that she is getting the hause. That I want to make money of her. That I can't stand her happiness. She saying that she would be happy for me. She saying that we should sell hause to stranger because I do not want her to have it. Obviously it is a massive overreaction. The rest of the family thinks that we are both in the wrong because she shouldn't get offended and I should keep my mouth shut. I can understand her because we all know her problems. I have the luxury to be emotionally stable because I have stable lifestyle. I know her and I know she just do not have the money and she want to manipulate me to give her the hause. I can feel the pressure because she is in the more difficult situation then I am. She has more money then I but also much more problems. I know everyone want her to have this home. But I really need the money and I want my share of the hause. The situation makes me feel selfish and cruel but also I know that I shouldn't have give up money for my sister if she drives bmv and I take the bus. I do not know what to do. I also do not know If I should speak to her because she is saying horrible stuff about me. I hope I wrote it right. English is not my first language OBVIOUSLY.

8,1gcqhm5,AITA for letting my former best friend borrow a gay book series?,"I (16F) have been best friends with Ivy (15F; fake name) since we were both toddlers. Her father and mine are very close friends since they both smoked a lot of pot together in highschool. Ivy and I never have had big problems. 

In middle school I found out I was bisexual. The only problem is that half of my family and my friends’ are homophobic and religious people. Which, there’s nothing wrong with that, believe what you want to believe. It still hurts though because I’ve been hiding for years. When I casually told Ivy about it, she took it well considering she is very religious much like her family. 

For my birthday two years ago I received an Amazon gift card. This was my chance to buy ANYTHING I wanted without being moderated (my dad sees what I buy on my debit card). Of course I chose to buy every volume of the Heartstopper book series and I keep them hidden at my mom’s (who is an atheist and doesn’t care what I read). 

Two years later when Ivy came over to my mom’s for a sleepover. It went like normal, we were messing around online, eating junk, having fun. Then she asked me if we could read the Heartstopper series because she had heard me talking about them every now and then. Of course I let her! We read the book about the gay boys together. We only got through volume one before she asked me if she could borrow all of them for the summer and return them when she finished. I said sure but to make sure she hid them from her parents. 

How could I be so fucking stupid?

Of course they found them when Ivy was out of the house. The day it happened I swear to fucking god it was like a cliff hanger in a over dramatic movie. She texted me the words: they found the books. I felt my heart drop and everything around me froze.

The first thing I did was also very stupid. I began to panic and I texted back many things but the most stupid one was: I don’t want to be outed to my dad.
Unknowingly admitted everything to her parents. They had to have read the texts.

They told my dad and I made up a lie that it was all just a joke and I wanted to make fun of a gay book series. The fact that I had to fucking lie about a teen romance novel is upsetting. I bet if it was a straight smut book they wouldn’t even bat an eye. 

My dad said I was the asshole for letting something they disagree with into their house. I was forced to write a letter of apology like a child. It was humiliating. But something in me can’t help but think that my father was right. Maybe I shouldn’t have let my friend borrow books if knew she wasn’t allowed to have them. 

Ivy texted me that she wasn’t mad and that’s the last time I’ve spoken to her. Her parents are still close with my dad. Every time they’re over there is this uncomfortable tension though. I know they know. One of our friends said she had talked to Ivy about it and Ivy said that she wasn’t allowed to be around me without supervision. What do they think I’m gonna do? Oh no, the bi is gonna fuck my daughter! 

So, Reddit am I the asshole?
",Not the A-hole,2024-10-26,"AITA for letting my former best friend borrow a gay book series? I (16F) have been best friends with Ivy (15F; fake name) since we were both toddlers. Her father and mine are very close friends since they both smoked a lot of pot together in highschool. Ivy and I never have had big problems. 

In middle school I found out I was bisexual. The only problem is that half of my family and my friends’ are homophobic and religious people. Which, there’s nothing wrong with that, believe what you want to believe. It still hurts though because I’ve been hiding for years. When I casually told Ivy about it, she took it well considering she is very religious much like her family. 

For my birthday two years ago I received an Amazon gift card. This was my chance to buy ANYTHING I wanted without being moderated (my dad sees what I buy on my debit card). Of course I chose to buy every volume of the Heartstopper book series and I keep them hidden at my mom’s (who is an atheist and doesn’t care what I read). 

Two years later when Ivy came over to my mom’s for a sleepover. It went like normal, we were messing around online, eating junk, having fun. Then she asked me if we could read the Heartstopper series because she had heard me talking about them every now and then. Of course I let her! We read the book about the gay boys together. We only got through volume one before she asked me if she could borrow all of them for the summer and return them when she finished. I said sure but to make sure she hid them from her parents.

I have low energy, battery gets drained super quickly- I need time+space to myself to recharge, else it does not look good on my mental. All good, I just need to rest when I get back. Thing is, I JUST returned home and a day later I hear from dad that relatives on his side already want to see us. Parents are divorced, I am spending a good amount of time at mom's per her request to go with her the day of return. 

Day 2: Dad calls again about how aunt is doing early bday celebration for grandpa on the 27th(very soon+short notice- actual bday on 29th)&that she wants us to go. Dad doesn't want to drive to pick me up for the event and hasn't jumpstarted his car. Parents live about an hour drive apart, so commute isn't short. Ok, I understand. He is tired from the trip too. Problem is I don't have a driver's license yet. He suggests for me to go with mom to work since she works nearby where he lives, and to stay overnight at his place until the event. But I don't feel in the mood to wake up at the brink of dawn, pack my things, travel, stay over for one night on such a short notice, socialize and put up a cheery, happy facade for 3+hours...you get the gist. Plus, I feel my period coming which means depressive episodes.

Dad sours in attitude and goes off about how his side's family always had to deal with not seeing me for these occasions when I was younger due to custody with controlling mom. I say I literally would, just that this time I'm tired, so if possible I'd be fine just going there on the day of the event. He then says how he thinks that me going just for those several hours are ""not enough for him"". The dinner starts at 5:30pm. Uh.. what?

17,1gcpa8p,AITA For Exluding a Friend?,"In my friend group, there’s this guy, Robbie, who’s known for being sexist. For years, people dismissed it, assuming he didn’t mean harm. I joined the group recently through my best friend, who used to date him. They’d ended things badly in 2014 when she gained weight from chemo, and he left her over it.

Years later, Robbie apologized, claiming he’d changed, and my friend, who’s incredibly forgiving, accepted him back as a friend. But his behavior never improved—he belittled her, called her “dramatic,” and would only introduce her as “his ex.” I urged her to cut him off, but she wanted to believe he’d grown up.

Then, at my birthday party, things went too far. I got drunk and passed out, leaving her vulnerable. Robbie, also drunk, forced a kiss on her and, when she tried to escape, pounded on the bathroom door, yelling for her to come out to “hook up.” She locked herself in and called other friends, and thankfully, our friend Jason’s mom stepped in and kicked Robbie out. I only found out months later when she confided in me, feeling ashamed, though I reassured her.


Robbie’s behavior wasn’t new. He’d tried to skip out on restaurant bills, cheated on girlfriends with sex workers and blamed his girlfriends, blamed women for his own terrible behavior, and would get hostile if any woman stood up to him. He also tried to control who could be friends with Jason, his is best friend, who’s genuinely nice but maybe a bit naive.

When Robbie found out, he accused us of judging him over “a drunken mistake” and insulted me, He called me a “white knight” and said I had no need to be one because I was not even into p*ssy. He even implied I had a thing for Jason, which isn’t true—I’d actually introduced Jason to a wonderful woman, and they hit it off.

That outburst finally pushed Jason to cut him off, and the rest of the group followed. Robbie’s been harassing Jason at work and trying to find me to “fight.” I’ve avoided him—not out of fear, but because a fight could jeopardize my visa if things got legal.

My best friend has since cut ties with Robbie completely and is working through her trauma. She’s grateful to our friends who supported her and to Jason’s mom.

He even implied I had a thing for Jason, which isn’t true—I’d actually introduced Jason to a wonderful woman, and they hit it off.

That outburst finally pushed Jason to cut him off, and the rest of the group followed. Robbie’s been harassing Jason at work and trying to find me to “fight.” I’ve avoided him—not out of fear, but because a fight could jeopardize my visa if things got legal.

My best friend has since cut ties with Robbie completely and is working through her trauma. She’s grateful to our friends who supported her and to Jason’s mom.

19,1gcoojj,AITA for only giving my roommate $200?,"hey y'all. So my (31f) cat (11m) unfortunately peed on my roommate's (30s f) futon mattress a couple times  over the last few months. TL;DR she wants $700 to fully cover the cost of replacing it and I gave her $200.

Details - 
The first time it happened in May he was struggling with an undiagnosed UTI and she said it was no big deal and she just wanted to let me know. Unfortunately when cats pee on something once it forever becomes a pee spot if they are able to access the area.

 In September my roommate left her bedroom door open and her bed was used as a bathroom again. I bought a special enzymatic cleaner and did my best to clean her mattress and offered to rent a steam cleaner as well as washing and remaking the bedding . 

This week she left her door open again and guess what happened, cat pee on her bed. I offered to clean it again and said verbatim ""I also want to offer to help with the cost of a new futon mattress"" which she thanked me for. The next day she asked me to haul the old mattress to the dump so I had my landlord arrange garbage pickup which I paid for, and hauled the mattress (approx 6-7 years old and already moderately period stained) downstairs to the pick up point. Next I heard from her she asked me to pick up the new mattress for her and that it would be $700. 

I'm a server bringing home $1400 paychecks, I do not have $700 for her. i also don't think it's my responsibility to fully fund the cost regardless of how much money I have, although if I had the money I would give it to her to make this go away. I looked up the cost of a mid-tier futon mattress and bed bath and beyond has queen size futons for $280-$400 so I think that $200 is a very fair amount to pay towards helping her get a new mattress. She says it is unthinkable that I wouldn't pay the entire $700 and is now suddenly ""uncomfortable"" with my boyfriend staying over 2-3 nights a week since she pored over our lease trying to find something to hold over me and  there is a 14 day visitor clause. 

i might be the asshole for not taking full financial responsibility for my cat's actions, or for not more explicitly stating the amount I was willing to contribute when I offered,, but I would love to hear your opinions !

20,1gco3re,AITA because I pay for a maid to clean the house before I come home? ,"I work out of town and my wife stays home with our two teen kids. 

When I'm home I take care of the housework to give my wife a break. 

The kids are supposed to help around the house in return for me paying for their phones and stuff. My wife chooses not to enforce that while I'm gone. 

Our income is split thusly. We pay all our bills. Including the kids phones. We set aside money for retire, vacations, emergencies, etc. What is left over is split evenly between her and I. So we each have money for fun stuff separately. 

For the last eight months or so she has made very little effort to keep the house clean while I'm gone. But she gets very upset if I just let it stay messy when I'm home. 

She says that the kids are too busy with extracurricular activities and their jobs to help and that she gets overwhelmed. 

She does not work. But kids are in high school. I bought them a car and I pay for everything except fuel. They are responsible for getting themselves to extracurriculars and whatever else they want to do. 

I told her that it wasn't fair for me to have to clean up four weeks of mess on my two weeks off. That she should be forcing the kids to do their part. 

She says it's too hard. 

Two shifts ago I told the kids I was done paying for their phones and car bills. The car was paid for cash so there isn't a loan or anything. Just insurance, registration, maintenance, that stuff. 

I took the money and I pay for a maid to come and clean up the day before I get home. That way I can just maintain it until I leave.

My wife is mad that the kids have to pay their own bills, and that I'm ""cheating"" by paying someone else to do my chores. I'm not. I'm paying someone to do their's. 

I found out she's been giving the kids money out of her share to pay their bills. She is now mad that I have money for my hobbies but she does not. I don't really care. She needs to do her part and clean up and parent.

One of the sides backs up to a neighbor, I thought the fence was no doubt mine because the posts of the fence are on my side and it connected to the rest of the fence which is clearly mine. 

However as the fence contractor took it down, the neighbor came out panicked and asked why we were taking down their fence. We ultimately measured the property lines with a survey and the fence was built exactly on the property line between my house and theirs. 

To keep the peace, I paid all costs to rebuild the fence promptly and it was complete within 2 days. I purchased materials and paid my fence contractor to build it exactly where it was and in the same style of fence. I then had my fence contractor build my new fence up against this fence but on my property line so I wouldn’t have any further issues.

I thought that was sufficient, however, now the neighbor is pressing me to also pay to have the new fence we built them stained. The old fence was so old and falling over I hadn’t even noticed it was stained, but they claim it was stained on their side.

Thoughts? Do I need to pay to stain the fence as well?

26,1gcm6ms,AITA- For using Black Metal to Wrestle Control of My Spotify Account Back from My Family,"So my mom’s side of the family has disowned me because they found out that I’m bi and nonbinary. My mom started a huge fight about it where she literally asked me to prove my identity to her- cuz asking your kids who’ve they been with is totally normal ig- and I angrily called the whole family homophobic and they told me to either go back to being the future Baptist minister I was when I was teenager or never speak to them again. Obviously, I chose the latter option.

But they’ve been harassing me ever since: my mom’s been love-bombing me and sending me passive aggressive prayer texts at me for a little over three weeks now. I’ve mostly ignored it but then yesterday happened:

So for context I set up a Spotify and Pandora account for my grandma back when I lived with her, but because I’ve signed on to one of her devices with my Spotify account in the past she still had access to it. She chose to use my account rather than hers at her birthday party yesterday- probably thinking I’d just let it go because it’s her birthday. And for the most part she was right, I wrestled control back once to listen to music on my drive to drop off my roommate at work- my radio is broken; but otherwise I just watched YouTube and let it go. 

However, once it was time to pick up my roommate I tried taking control back.

Context: my family is extremely paranoid and superstitious, and they think that song is so evil that we were not allowed to listen to the Eagles growing up so they were 100% trying to creep me out. 

But- plot twist- I’m an adult who listens to black metal and industrial so that song ain’t shit. I decided two could play that game and made it so Mayhem’s “De Mysteris Dom Sathanas” played on their tv at full volume.

When I signed back in they had still had that playing so- knowing them- I think they freaked out and turned grandma’s TV off when that started playing. (Of course, it’s always possible they liked the song but press “x” to doubt.)

Anyway one of my friend’s thinks it’s funny but my roommate thinks I overreacted and there were kids at the party who would’ve had to deal with whatever blow up happened (my family doesn’t handle things they don’t like well and growing up parties typically ended in fist fights or verbal sparring matches over dumb comments), so I have mixed feelings about it.

My mom started a huge fight about it where she literally asked me to prove my identity to her- cuz asking your kids who’ve they been with is totally normal ig- and I angrily called the whole family homophobic and they told me to either go back to being the future Baptist minister I was when I was teenager or never speak to them again. Obviously, I chose the latter option.

But they’ve been harassing me ever since: my mom’s been love-bombing me and sending me passive aggressive prayer texts at me for a little over three weeks now. I’ve mostly ignored it but then yesterday happened:

So for context I set up a Spotify and Pandora account for my grandma back when I lived with her, but because I’ve signed on to one of her devices with my Spotify account in the past she still had access to it. She chose to use my account rather than hers at her birthday party yesterday- probably thinking I’d just let it go because it’s her birthday. And for the most part she was right, I wrestled control back once to listen to music on my drive to drop off my roommate at work- my radio is broken; but otherwise I just watched YouTube and let it go. 

However, once it was time to pick up my roommate I tried taking control back. I changed the password on my Spotify as well so that I wouldn’t have to worry about it in the future, and they immediately took back control because Spotify doesn’t automatically log out all devices when you change passwords, I took back control again, and they responded by making it where “Hotel California” played on my phone rather than their tv.

29,1gclqtp,WIBTA if I refused to contribute to my parent’s household,"Hi everyone, 

Some context, I (24F) am currently living with my father (70sM) and stepmom (50sF). I moved in with them back in Nov 23 to escape an unsafe situation with my bio-mom (60sF). Since my parents divorced when I was 5, my parents agreed that Mom would take 100% custody and Dad got remarried to my Stepmom (they were having an affair). Dad knew my Mom was unstable, and ultimately decided he needed to get out as fast as possible and by whatever means necessary. He admitted to this, this is not an assumption I had made. I have not lived with Dad nor stayed overnights since the divorce (until now obvs). 

Since moving in Nov 23, I have paid all my own personal expenses including phone bills and groceries as well as  contributed to household chores. In recent months, both Dad and Stepmom went overseas for a few months and I stayed home. They live on a multi-acre property and keep livestock. So they have some family friends come around and take care of the animals. During this time, I maintained the general household such as cleaning, repairs, pest control and helped Dad continue to run his business by sending out orders and writing up dockets. 

They just returned and I've noticed they placed the water bill on my desk. I assume they want me to pay it. The water bill shows that 700 litres of water has been used a day! I instantly tell Dad that can't be right and there's no way I could have used all that water. He tells me that he is aware there's a small leak in the line but isn't fussed about it. 

I asked my half-brother (46M) when he moved out of the home and if he ever contributed to bills. He said he moved out at 25-26 and he was never asked to pay bills/rent/board, nor did he buy his own groceries. Dad had full custody of Brother when growing up so Brother lived with him full time anyway. 

The bill is still in my possession and I am expected to pay it. I'm do not think it's fair for me to pay such a large sum when 1) some of the water would have been used for livestock, 2) there's a leak that's inflating the bill 3) Brother never had to pay anything and 4) I just think someone that shafted me to remarry and hardly contributed to my basic needs as a child shouldn't be asking me to pay shit 

WIBTA if I just flat out refused to pay the utilities or contribute to utilities/household bills? I'm building a house and it takes some time so I'm only here for another 18 months and then I can be free from both parents tbh. 


Editing to add from advice below: the reason I've included my childhood backstory was to paint a picture that my dad did not contribute financially or otherwise to raising me from 4yo onwards. He would owe thousands in unpaid child support if he didn't threaten my mum to sign off that he paid when he didn't.

	•	Bf = boyfriend
	•	FIL = boyfriend’s father
	•	MIL = boyfriend’s mother

My bf and I have been dating for almost 5 years, and I get along well with his parents.

Recently, we visited his parents, and as we were chatting, FIL jokingly said he needed to talk to me about my social media. Confused, I made a lighthearted comment, but it caught me off guard. MIL was laughing at my reaction, as she didn’t know what FIL was going to say. FIL was talking about my Facebook profile picture. Apparently I was suggested to him on Facebook and he saw my Facebook profile picture and stated it wasn’t a good idea to have it as that due to employers. To clarify: 
1. I don’t use Facebook often. I have friends and family on there and this photo has been up for at least 4 months now.
2. The picture in question is a mirror picture in a bikini w a long coverup on. My leg is a bit exposed.
3. I thought my profile settings restricted strangers from seeing my photos.

I was kind of stunned, feeling awkward and embarrassed and pulled out my phone because I genuinely did not know what photo he was referring to. My bf was standing next to me and immediately starts saying “YEAH (my name) change the profile picture”. He didn’t know what the photo was but just siding with his dad. At that point, I was just awkwardly swiping on my phone because I didn’t know what to do. My bf is just saying “yeah…” siding with his father and didn’t add anything to the conversation. He knows I get anxious in situations like this. 

MIL asked FIL what the photo was and she went to find it and FIL was just talking about how he was shocked to see the photo and how there’s a lot of creeps out there and I was again, just standing there awkwardly not really saying much with my phone in my hand. Bf then left me to go to his room to do something and again, I just just standing there not saying much and then Bf was “OKAY JUST CHANGE IT AFTER” and comes back and tries to grab my phone out of my hand.

Conversation kind of just died down and then I went to bf’s room to just lay down and to just analyze wtf just happened. Bf goes to the living room (where FIL & MIL were) and starts yelling “(my name) COMEEEEEE TO THE LIVING ROOM”. I just ignored my bf because I wasn’t sad or upset, I just wanted to lay down.

Later in the night, FIL spoke to me privately saying how he didn’t want me to take offence to what he said and he was just looking out for me due to my line of work and creeps being out there. I explained that I did not think the photo was problematic, though my intent was to restrict public access.

31,1gckgk7,AITA for refusing to walk my sister's dog?,"**Background:**

 I'm (20F) a college student living with my sister (23) while our parents are abroad for health reasons. A week before I moved in with her, she got a Jack Russell puppy without consulting anyone. My parents weren’t happy because 1.our apartment is too small for such a high-energy breed and 2. My sister, who works as a lawyer intern from morning to 7PM, obviously can't take care of it. 

A week later I was omw to her house. She called me saying ""Don't tell my parents I haven't changed your sheets. They will get mad at me."" If only I knew how bad things would get.

I arrived and the house was FILTHY. Dirty dishes, black moldy food in the fridge, the dog had escaped from its pen and peed god knows where. My sister had dumped her belongings all over my desk, making it unusable. (All while she knew I would be coming one week in advance) When I asked her to clean up, she dismissed me saying she was too tired from work due to her schedule and told me to ""find another desk."" And ""if you don't like it, you shouldn't have come."" (Dude. I HAVE SCHOOL??)

First I thought she struggled from depression. However, it soon became clear that she was just taking advantage of me. Anytime I cleaned, the mess kept returning. She continued to neglect the dog and the apartment, not even doing basic things like putting her dirty dishes in the dishwasher or wiping the table after she has finished eating.

My parents know how she is. My dad told her to rehome the dog since she clearly couldn’t care for it. She resisted but eventually she found a new owner. Despite this, she blamed me for the mess, saying I should take care of the dog since I was around. She even scolded me when I told her I had plans outside, insisting I stay home to care for it. One time I overheard her telling a friend that she would have abandoned the dog if I didn't exist.  

**The event:**

One morning she overslept and asked me to walk the dog before I left for school. For the first time, I refused. I said it wasn’t my responsibility. 

She responded by insulting me, calling me the r-word, disgusting, that I was an evil person, the works. I yelled back saying her poor life choices weren’t my problem. I left for school, and she texted me threats, warning me not to tell our parents or come home until she cleaned the place or else she would ""start a fight"". I told her to fuck off and that she should worry about her own nastiness rather than how she appears to others, especially my parents, who know her better than I do.

When I returned, the apartment was miraculously clean. But ofc, by the next morning, it was back to its usual mess and ""I'll do it later""s that I no longer trust. Confronting her only led to more passive-aggressive remarks and me being mean to her and making rude remarks back that probably made me in the wrong.

32,1gckcgs,AITA for snapping at my stressed out partner ,"Married to someone whose completing their PhD. It's taken 9 years. He's on the final leg and is being totally insufferable. 

We have always had a very equitable household, with tasks split usually pretty evenly. But in the lead up to this he dropped the ball and I've been left to do literally everything. Cooking, cleaning, basic household admin (bills etc). And I was fine with it originally, we even spoke about how this will be taxing and I may need to help him out as he wraps up. But that was a while ago, and this f*cking PhD does not have an official due date, so is being drawn further and further out. So I'm still doing everything at home, while working and completing my own final semester of my Bachelor's degree that has taken me a long time too. 

His justification for this PhD being super important is (he says) the impact it will have on his earning potential (which will be helpful for the household overall?) but I think it's mostly just academic hubris. I would much rather us have a healthy relationship that him have a stupid Dr title and some extra cash that isn't even actually mine.

He's been short with me for a good 7 days. Anytime I speak, it's often met with a large sigh, a pause and a dramatic ""yes?"" which makes everything I do have to say feel frivolous, and sometimes maybe it is? But not being able to say anything is so isolating and he's really curt with me whether I'm interrupting or not. 

Tonight I was in bed early after my (unpaid) 9 hour placement and he was coming to bed. I saw something on my phone, tried to direct his attention to it (a relatively lightheaded 'haha look at this!' type of thing), and was met with the stock standard ""ugh what now"" energy I've been getting for weeks and months now. 

I am so over it at the point I barked ""DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT"" and said my piece - this has been a constant and I'm sick of being made to feel bad, that I understand a PhD is stressful but unfortunately I have no further interest in being treated like some annoying child getting in your way - I even tried to say that I know that he's at the end of it all and this might seem a bit selfish from my end I'm ultimately, I've met my limit. Actually I'm not quite sure exactly what I said, but it was all spoken (not yelled) and his response was one of exasperation and irritation. He took his pillows and went to sleep on the couch.

Anytime I speak, it's often met with a large sigh, a pause and a dramatic ""yes?"" which makes everything I do have to say feel frivolous, and sometimes maybe it is? But not being able to say anything is so isolating and he's really curt with me whether I'm interrupting or not. 

Tonight I was in bed early after my (unpaid) 9 hour placement and he was coming to bed. I saw something on my phone, tried to direct his attention to it (a relatively lightheaded 'haha look at this!' type of thing), and was met with the stock standard ""ugh what now"" energy I've been getting for weeks and months now. 

I am so over it at the point I barked ""DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT"" and said my piece - this has been a constant and I'm sick of being made to feel bad, that I understand a PhD is stressful but unfortunately I have no further interest in being treated like some annoying child getting in your way - I even tried to say that I know that he's at the end of it all and this might seem a bit selfish from my end I'm ultimately, I've met my limit. Actually I'm not quite sure exactly what I said, but it was all spoken (not yelled) and his response was one of exasperation and irritation. He took his pillows and went to sleep on the couch. 

Have I been a brat? Is he being a diva? Who ITA? ",0.0,0.033967663,0,1
33,1gcjm22,WIBTAH If I Reported my Manager for Saying Sexual Things to Me?,"
My manager (M, late 40s/early 50s) recently told me (F25) a few sexual things while we were working together this past week. His comments really caught me off guard and made me extremely uncomfortable, to the point where I’m considering reporting him. However, I know reporting stuff like that should only be done if the situation is serious, because it can harm the accused person’s reputation. So I’m looking for a few other peoples’ perspectives on the situation that can hopefully help me determine if I should report him.

I recently got into a big fight with my immediate family. It really affected me, to the point where, the day after our fight, I wasn’t my usual self at work. Instead of being my usual peppy and talkative self, I was very quiet and moody. My manager noticed this, so I just let it all out and explained to him what had happened with my family. In hindsight, I probably shouldn’t have done that, cause he’s only been working at our company as manager (and in general) for maybe two months, so I don’t know him too too well. He also kinda already gave me a very weird vibe before this interaction I’m about to share. But in the moment I was very upset and depressed and needed someone to talk to. 

After I filled him in on what happened with my family, he went on a long spiel about how it’s important to establish clear and appropriate boundaries with your parents as an adult. Which is true. But the example he used to illustrate this point is what shocked me and made me uncomfortable. He basically said that I need to be like “Mom, please stop washing my laundry. I can wash my own laundry. I have sexy things in there I don’t want you to see.” He followed this with “Don’t let anyone touch your stuff, be like “Don’t touch my handcuffs and whips.” 

Alarm bells started going off in my head because the fight with my family had nothing to do with sexual stuff AT ALL. So I feel the example he used was totally inappropriate. I was also really embarrassed because, by the time I finished my story and my manager said this stuff to me, a client (M, 40s) had come into the store and was within earshot of everything he said. 

A little bit later my manager told me I need to relax. He asked me if I like getting full body massages, and when I said “No” he was like “You don’t like someone massaging on your body or rubbing up on your feet or anything?” I said “No, I don’t like paying a random stranger to touch me. That’s kinda weird to me. I’d be uncomfortable the whole time.” (Cause I’m awkward AF.) And he responded “It’s not like it’s a sexual thing.”

My manager then suggested I should hang out with some friends to get my mind off things. He asked me “Are you hanging out after work? What do you like to do for hang outs?” I jokingly told him I don’t have any friends, and he said “I’ll snatch you up. You want me to snatch you up? I think you’d like that. You would love it. I’ll snatch you up.” 

Also, before this incident, there was a day my manager brushed his hand across my forearm while I was working because he noticed I had scratches on my arm. He asked me what had happened while he rubbed his hand across my arm. And before that, I’d been standing in front of a fan at work one time to cool off cause I get really hot easily, and he said I looked like a supermodel with the wind blowing my hair. I laughed at his joke, and was like “Yeah, I’m a super model on the side.” And he responded “As long as you’re not out here selling feet pics.” And he said that in front of two of my male coworkers.

Anyways, am I just overreacting? Or are these serious red flags that should be reported? I’m also hesitant to report him because, if anything comes of it, he’ll know I was the one who did it because I’m one of the only two women who work there, and he and my other female coworker don’t interact as much as he and I do.

Albert and I have been friends since the start of the year, and we were best friends to the point of wanting to be with each other all the time until now

The trip in general was 43 and a half hours long. For most of the time (40 hours) he was with another person talking about Brawl Stars (yes, only that) and when I approached him, he acted as if he didn't want me to be with him. And when I told something to him, he only answered with ok mostly (it wasn't questions or offers, he could answer ok to Are you having fun?) or just wasn't hearing me

Also, we were planning to have a sort of party in the hotel, and he agreed to do so whether we were tired or not. And then, he disagreed for being tired, when he wasn't even that tired.

And on the bus back to our home town, he decided to sit with another person and left me alone and didn't say to me anything, when I kept talking to them when they were alone.

So was he the asshole or was I overreacting?

He frequently (more than once a week) likes to visit with his friend after his shift and I wait in the car with our toddler while they smoke.  I dislike feeling like his uber, but I am glad he is trying to be safe regarding drunk driving.  Yesterday was my birthday, so I was surprised when we were dropping off a coworker and he told me he wanted to go to his friend’s house.  I said that this did not thrill me and asked if his friend had a big birthday cake that we’d be sharing.  He acknowledged that I was unhappy and he insisted on going anyway and said he’d only be a few minutes.  After 20 minutes I asked him to leave.  He said he needed to smoke a cigarette and would need 5 more minutes, so I waited 10 more minutes and then I texted him that time was up and asked him if he wanted to stay over with his friend or come home with me.  He did not reply and I drove off and immediately received a barrage of texts asking me to come back to pick him up.  I do so and he gets in the car and asks me what my problem is.  I tell him that it’s my birthday and our last night in the apartment alone together before his nephew moves into the living room for 3 months and our new baby is also going to be born in 3 months, so I was looking forward to eating the dinner I had cooked together and spending some time together on our last night alone for the forseable future.  He tells me that I f*cked up- that he wanted these things too, but instead of “being cool” and chilling with his friend, I started acting like a bitch and now he has no affection for me and chose to sleep on the couch. He insisted he only needed 10 minutes to smoke a bowl with his friend and I did not point out that he spent over 30 minutes.  I understand that he needs to decompress after work, and even though I don’t like being told to wait in the car, I accommodated him and he responded by pouting, withholding affection, telling me that I’m always negative and refusing to come to bed.

They reflect my journey through a tough period in my life and carry a lot of personal meaning. I was excited to display them at a local gallery, hoping to connect with others through my work.

A few days before the opening, my friend, Quinn (30, art enthusiast), asked if I’d be willing to let them showcase my work in their new online magazine that focuses on local artists. While I appreciated the offer, I hesitated because I wanted my pieces to be presented in a specific way—through the gallery setting, where I could engage with the audience directly.

Quinn pressed, emphasizing that it would be a great opportunity to reach a wider audience and gain recognition. I felt torn; on one hand, I wanted to support my friend and get my work out there, but on the other hand, I didn’t want my art to be diluted by a medium I wasn’t comfortable with.

I decided to politely decline, explaining my reasons. I thought it was respectful to maintain the integrity of my art and the vision I had for it. However, Quinn became frustrated and accused me of being selfish. They said I was missing out on a chance that many artists would kill for. This confrontation left me feeling guilty, especially since I value our friendship.

The last time I've eaten them was yesterday, and they were full last time I checked.

For context, my mother went to the store on thursday and got a lot of the wrong things, and a lot of things we didn't need since she never makes a list. She bought my sister the wrong chips. 

Anyways. I went to her room, she was still sleeping until I started yelling at her. I can't remember exactly what I said but I remember telling her something like, ""why did you eat my chips!? You have your own bag of chips (I knew that she didn't have the right kind but I was mad at the time so that's on me) and you decide to eat mine!"" She tried to say that she didn't eat all of them but she technically did because there was barely anything left. Like, five chips opposed to a full bag. And she left them open all night so they were stale. And they were crushed. She also said that she does not have her own bag of chips, which I understood that. But, one again, I was mad at the time. Still not an excuse though, I know. 

I told her that I don't care and that I don't want her touching my chips again. I also tossed the bag to her and told her that she could have them since they're stale anyways.

She tried to say that she didn't eat all of them but she technically did because there was barely anything left. Like, five chips opposed to a full bag. And she left them open all night so they were stale. And they were crushed. She also said that she does not have her own bag of chips, which I understood that. But, one again, I was mad at the time. Still not an excuse though, I know. 

I told her that I don't care and that I don't want her touching my chips again. I also tossed the bag to her and told her that she could have them since they're stale anyways.

41,1gcip3k,AITA for taking a solo bedroom instead of sharing with a stepbrother?,"My dad and his wife bought a new house together and we moved in last week. Before moving I (15m) was told I could get my own room or share with one of my stepbrothers (11 and 7). Even though I was offered the choice my dad and his wife wanted me to share with one of the boys. The reason for that is both stepbrothers think of me as a brother, not a step, and because they both admire me/look up to me.

The 7 year old hero worships me and is super clingy and always wants to hang out and be my friend and be my brother. It's a lot really. I don't like it. Sometimes I like getting out of the house just to not have my shadow with me everywhere I go. Most people would find it sweet but I find it exhausting. When we lived in the other house he always wanted to sleep in my room for ""sleepovers"" and stuff and was disappointed when I'd say no.

The 11 year old has autism and he looks up to me too but in a different way. I'm one of the only people he has ever wanted to spend time with. I'm one of the only people he's comfortable around too. He doesn't sleep great but will nap if I'm in the room so they thought I'd be good for him in that way.

They think I'd be good for both but they don't have the closest of relationships and the 7 year old can make the 11 year old edgy so them sharing is not a great solution.

I never wanted to share with either of them and since we all live together 100% of the time (no other parents to go to) I knew having my own room was a big deal for me. So I chose my own room. My dad and his wife were really unhappy about it. They gave me the choice though, for reasons, so they're willing to follow through but they're also going to make sure I know how disappointed and unhappy it makes them.

A couple months back (let’s call it maybe 3?) I met a guy let’s call ""C""
And we immediately hit it off. 

We met on Lethal company and gathered a friendship. We soon spread to discord and chat there from then on. 

Connections formed on Roblox and Vrchat, along to other chat sites like steam chat (I personally wanted to stay on Discord) chats went by and I thought I found a person who could really connect. We had more personal conversations as we became more trustworthy. 

But I noticed he would text me constantly. Every morning, nearly at 30-ish minute intervals. It was getting repetitive as I wanted some time to myself and other friends. 

Out of absolute nowhere his dad would text me up. Me being a nice person had a little chat and he said how he was thankful to finally have a friend. I was grateful to be his as well and the text stopped after. 

About a month later though I would get the news my grandfather passed away. And of course I chatted about that with C. 

He said we would be okay. A nice change. At this point I could easily trust C. After a sob filled call between me and him at the funeral things were going okay. A few weeks after met return from the funeral things took an odd spin. 

A double friendship would occur with C and another user which I will refer to as S. C, me and S, immediately also became friends. We played games some nights etc. 

One day on Roblox VC C would come up to me in tears explaining something with S happened. 

I talked with him and he explained that a fight emerged between the two because of a question C asked. It’s very fuzzy but it ended with S Blocking C on all fronts. C is 24, S is 18 which I thought was odd. 

I decided I couldn’t take this much stress so I broke from the main conversations with him for about a week. He would CONSTANTLY text me asking to talk. I would ignore him as I wanted no part. 

He wouldn’t take that though. He found me on vrchat and forced me to talk so I broke it to him in the nicest way possible that this was not working out. He rightfully was confused and a bit shocked. But I was feeling uncomfortable around him and did not want to be dragged into something more serious or dangerous. 

I closed the app and went to bed. The following weeks I blocked him on all messaging sites. I haven’t heard from him since, and I feel better but still a bit hurt.

Prior to marriage my husband or then boyfriend/fiancé would come over to my parents house and visit them/me and spend lots of time with us. They had a great relationship and I always stressed how important my family is to me and he always had shown me how much of a family oriented person he is himself. 

Everything was great till about 2020 (4 years into marriage - the year we had our first baby) when he started saying things like “your dad has a problem with me” “your dad doesn’t like me/is annoyed at me” etc. 
I always told him my family loves him and don’t have any problems with him, they’re simple people and generally have good relationships around them, I’ve never seen them to have problems with anyone around us.  
My husband asked my dad if he was annoyed at him for something in which my dad said “no nothing why would you think anything like that?”  But my husband took it as he was brushing him off and this is where all the decline happened. Just a few months after having baby things got very ugly between my husband and my family (I won’t get into details (check edit end of post, I went into some detail)) and my husband decided to completely cut them out and have zero communication with them. It hurt me beyond measure and caused us to have many fights to levels that have made us think of leaving each other. 

My husband is very hurt over things he claims my family has done however they literally haven’t done anything to him and that’s where my husband calls me naive for not seeing “how crap they are”. Things were very bad till end of 2023 and the relationship couldn’t be fixed prior. Since the end of 2023 so now a whole year, I’ve asked my husband multiple times to forgive them and to move on (even though they didn’t do anything) since it’s really affecting my quality of life. He doesn’t allow me to get any help with the kids from my mum such as taking care of them without me there, doesn’t allow my family to come over to our house and bumping into each other in public places is very awkward since they don’t say hello to each other with other people we know around and I can barely even invite them to my kids birthdays in public places. 

I keep telling him that a strained relationship with my family isn’t good for our kids and will cause them anxieties when they’re older and our daughter (4 year old) is going to start questioning this dynamic very soon which isn’t something I want her to see. 

All I ask of him is to make peace, say hello when they say each other and be welcoming whenever we host birthdays for our kids so our kids can have their grandparents/cousins there too. I’m not asking for anything more of him such as going over to their house or to hang out with them, just simply to make peace so the communication between them isn’t completely cut off.

In return he started sending anonymous emails to my dad that were extremely rude and started signing him up to websites that are completely inappropriate (he denied all of it)).

We’d been friends for three years, all of us in our last year of high school. I was struggling with a conflict with my art teacher, which led to multiple HOD interventions and meetings. It got so bad that I had to start therapy. I thought my friends would support me, but things went differently.

Since Lita and Sun were in the same class, they knew the situation. Lee listened and seemed understanding, but Lita and Sun told me to just “do what she says” to avoid conflict. I felt hurt by their stance, knowing they were close to the teacher through a mutual friend.

Eventually, rumors about my conflict with the teacher spread. I sent a message asking everyone to respect my privacy, but Sego, a close friend, told me that Lita and Sun were spreading false information about me. When I confronted them, they denied it, tried to gaslight me, and accused me of being disloyal for believing Sego over them. Finally, they admitted it without remorse, so I ended our friendship.

When I reached out to Lee, who had experienced similar issues with them in the past, she didn’t take sides and continued hanging out with them. I felt betrayed and decided to cut off all three of them. I realized they weren’t the friends I thought they were; they often talked behind people’s backs and avoided accountability.

48,1gchuja,AITAH for hesitating to learn my boyfriend’s first language ,"I (20f) and my boyfriend (20m) have been dating for over three years and we’re now both in our second year of college. For context, we both live in Transilvania, Romania and there are a lot of Hungarians here due to history. I’m 100% Romanian and before meeting him, I only knew two three words in Hungarian even though Transilvania is full of Hungarians. In school he was tought in both Hungarian and Romanian. 

Ever since we started dating, I’ve been trying to learn Hungarian. It’s been quite some time and I am starting to catch on a few conversations and random words so I often understand what he’s saying when he’s talking to his family or friends. He lights up and gets excited when he sees that I understand so I know it means a lot to him. 
I’ve also noticed how different he is when he’s talking in his language. He seems more confident and talks a lot faster without stopping to think about what he’s going to say. He means so much to me so obviously I really want to get to know that side of him. 

Even if it’s been more than three years, my parents don’t take our relationship as serious as they should since we’re so young. So whenever they discover a notebook or the dictionary he gave me in my room, they make fun of me and argue that I’m not going to concentrate on my studies if I waste my time learning a new language just for my boyfriend; that he knew what he was getting into when he started dating me and he shouldn’t be bothered to only speak Romanian. More than that, they believe his family and friends should only speak Romanian around me just out of politeness since I can’t understand all of it(definitely not something I agree with).
 
I’m a very passionate person, so after the arguments with my parents I really do think that learning a new language is going to interfere with my academic life. I have a challenging degree, computer science, so I usually don’t have a lot of time. 

Also, in the first year of being together, I started to learn Hungarian on Duolingo. After a year however, we had two big fights that took us close to breaking up. As I said I’m a very passionate person so I took those fights to heart and those few days I didn’t want to be touched or spoken to. Everything that reminded me of him made me cry. I was really emotional. Ever since, I stopped doing my Duolingo lessons and everytime I look at the app or open it, it makes me sick to my stomach. 

I do feel some pressure from him but mostly from his family and it makes me feel bad. His sister’s fiancé is half Romanian half Hungarian and so he speaks a little bit of their language. I struggle with anxiety a lot so everytime I try to say anything in Hungarian in front of his family I can’t get out the words, I sweat and get dizzy and end up answering in Romanian. Because of that, I believe his family thinks I’m not trying to learn at all.

49,1gcht3e,AITA asshole for removing my name from a mortgage to leave my family and not provide them with financial support? ,"I’m the eldest son of South Asian parents who moved to the West before I was born. Despite financial strain, they sent money abroad to support their families. Religion was core to their lives, and when I tried to step away from it, they labeled me as delusional.

As a teenager, I struggled with depression, and my lecturers reached out to my parents, hoping I’d get help. On the way to the doctor, my dad dismissed my struggles, saying I was weak and had never faced “real” hardship like those in third-world countries. My mom suggested I just talk to her, so I downplayed my feelings to the doctor.

I’d wanted to move away for university, but my dad insisted I stay, saying I was too young and it would upset him. Not wanting to study from home, I got a job instead and was asked to start contributing to the household bills right away.

I have two older sisters and a younger brother. My oldest sister and I are the primary earners, while my second-oldest sister quit her job and isn’t on the mortgage. My dad works part-time due to back pain and has a lot of debt, while my mom is a stay-at-home mom. Although I try to support her emotionally, she insists she’s happy with her life.

Eventually, I received a promotion and got a new job with private healthcare, which allowed me to access a therapist who helped me recover. Still, when I confided in my family, I was judged and made to feel weak. After another promotion, I decided it was time to move out. My family initially supported my mortgage but later turned against me, pressuring me to buy a house with my oldest sister, tying me down financially.

When my second-oldest sister quit her job, nearly my whole salary went toward household expenses, and I took on £10,000 in debt for renovations. With only two earners at the time, I was told to “deal with it” as the oldest son. My dad’s limited income went mostly to his own debt, and he expects us to support him in retirement. My younger brother, now in university, doesn’t contribute much financially, though my second-oldest sister’s new job has relieved some pressure. Still, I’m left with a £10,000 debt—for a house I didn’t want.

My parents also disapprove of my girlfriend because she’s from a different background and isn’t religious. They’ve even said they won’t meet her for years. That was the tipping point for me. I told them I’d sell my share of the mortgage to a family member, reclaim my contributions, and move out. The bank approved, but my dad called me selfish and ridiculous, fearing they’d be left without a backup if my sisters decide to move out too.

After supporting my family financially for so long, I feel it’s time to prioritise my well-being. Once I’ve paid off my debt and the mortgage is off my name, I plan to move out. Am I the asshole here?

Edit: The bank approving of me selling my share was for selling my share to my sister, who is the joint owner on the current mortgage, if she agrees. I said selling to a family member and not specifically her, in case my other sister wanted to buy my share of the house. The bank has approved of a remortgage without penalties as long as the new mortgage is with the same bank.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-26,"AITA asshole for removing my name from a mortgage to leave my family and not provide them with financial support?

50,1gchkod,AITA for expecting to have the bigger room with ensuite on my friend group vacation because I'm married and expecting?,"So, we have a friend group of four, and one of my friends, let’s call her Sam, suggested we go away as couples. Since we’re all in long-term relationships, that meant there’d be eight of us going away for the weekend. We all agreed, and, as usual, Sam took charge of the planning. She loves arranging these outings, so we just showed up as planned.

Sam and her partner arrived at the place before the rest of us. When we arrived, we were all checking out the rooms, and I noticed this beautiful, spacious room with an ensuite. I asked Sam if my partner and I could stay in that room since her bags were already in there, and she laughed, saying, “First dibs!” I told her that, since I'm pregnant, it would be more comfortable for me to have an ensuite bathroom. It would make things easier for my husband and me, but she insisted her bags were already there and didn’t see why I couldn’t just take another room since the others were about the same size, just without the ensuite.

In my head, I thought, ""since we're the only ones married and I'm five months pregnant, wouldn’t it make sense for us to have the more convenient room?"" Unfortunately, I ended up saying that out loud. She got upset, saying she had planned the entire trip and arrived first, so she didn’t see why I thought I should get the bigger room. I got frustrated and walked away, and the weekend was pretty awkward afterward. It’s been two days now, and I tried to reach out to clear the air, but she’s not responding.

51,1gch7g4,AITA for not inviting my entire family to my wedding?,"fake names. 

got engaged in 2022. we had the engagement party in early 2023 and announced we would be getting married at a small wedding April 2024

in a chat with my cousin Pip, I said we are hoping for a small day about 30 people and it meant maybe not everyone would be invited

it came up at a kid’s party that we weren’t at because we had covid. my grandmother (GM) and aunt Ruby lost their shit. blew up that not everyone was to be invited and that’s not fair. nothing was set in stone, no invites had even been sent out yet and I had 50 done

i was told what happened and was upset this occurred without us being there to explain why and at an event that was meant to celebrate a one year old! I told my dad what happened

weeks later, my aunt Ruby and dad have a heated discussion about what happened and nasty things were said about me. the conversation ends with my dad cutting ties with his sister

Ruby rings me and tells me she’s not upset about it and blamed the ordeal on the others telling lies. she told me when I give my GM her invite, she will be declining and handing it back because it’s not fair the rest of the family isn’t invited. she went on to say things like “why are you getting married if you can’t afford it?” “why don’t you wait until you can afford a big wedding?”. what gives her the right?

skip a few months to my son’s first bday party. my mum attempts to say hello to my GM who ignores her and won’t even look at her, but acts normal with us. mum is devastated and walks away. for the rest of the party, if mum went near my GM, GM would walk away. after witnessing this, i made the decision not to even invite my GM. why would I after seeing her treat my mum this way and why would I want to go through the heartbreak of having her give it back?

skip to April, we got married. without them there. we had the best day and it was about celebrating us

neither of my aunts (Ruby and Pam) nor my GM contacted us, congratulated us or even gave us a like on socials

i was a bridesmaid for Pip 5 weeks later and Ruby’s daughter Mel was also. When I walked out, silence from them. When Mel walked out, Ruby and my GM shed tears because Mel looked beautiful in her bridesmaid dress

After the ceremony, I find my GM, Ruby, Pam and made the effort to say hello. I gave all of them a kiss and a hug, asked how they were. I felt I did the right thing. Not once, during the whole event did any of them congratulate us or even make mention of our wedding

Later, Ruby was dancing and mum approached her. “Can we get together and sort this out?” “Nope” and Ruby left the dance floor

After the wedding, Pam’s husband asked my mum and dad to get together with him and Pam. He wanted everything to go back the way it was. Mum was excited and set a date. The following day he messaged saying “Sorry, Pam said no, said it’s her family and i’m not to get involved”

No contact since. It was my 30th yesterday and nil. It’s finished between us

I recently suggested to her that maybe she shouldn’t vape in front of her younger kids.

I then told her I didn’t want to be around her or the kids, who I’m fairly close with, until she stops vaping around them indoors and especially around the younger ones. She accused me of trying to manipulate her and says it’s not my place.

I started just half a year ago and still meeting different people and trying to build some connections. It was also pretty challenging, as the company is very  much distributed between different countries. 

It was recently announced that the company will start building AI-focused department. Their responsibilities are not exaclty clear and they are going to have quite a long transition period. It is also not clear how it will impact any of us. 

My boyfriend is starting his AI-related startup. They are not officially founded yet, but already have a product and got the investments, so it is not an ideation stage anymore. I think they are doing a great product and are actually on the way to making it.

When I was telling him these news, he asked me if I can introduce him to this department. The thing is, I have no idea about people working there and he wants me to introduce him to the director of that department that I have never talked to in my life. So I told him that let's see about that and wait a bit, until things about that department will get at least more clear. 

He started pushing me to do that, saying that it is not that difficult, I can just send them an email. 

Just for a background info, I am not an extremely social person and networking is quite challenging for me, let alone jumping 5 seniority levels above me to the different department with a cold outreach about his startup. I have never done anything similar before, so I don't really feel that comfortable doing this. More to that, I am just building my reputation in the company and some people might see this inappropriate, as the hierarchy there is not that flat. So I told him all of that and said that I cannot introduce him to the people I myself don't know yet and that we can wait a bit and see what kind of way I can use to introduce his startup to the department.

BF told me that I am unreliable and I am an obstacle to him. He told me that most likely I just don't believe in him and that I could easily help him with an email.

54,1gcgqt5,AITA for not covering for my ex-bestfriend's shortcomings and mistakes and not caring anymore?,"To start the story, I must first emphasize that I am not a perfect person nor am I a perfect bestfriend. 

Me and Rap became friends 5 years ago. I am very thankful to him, because he became my friend during a time in my life when I was depressed. He was a really sweet but strict friend who always took care of me and looked out for me. Our friendship started to get destroyed when I left the place where used to live, study and work due to my declining mental health.

Weeks after I left, news started reaching me that he was badmouthing me to our friends. I did not believe them at first, but they sent me a post on F***b**k by him that said how I used my money to make him follow my demands (EMPHASIS on how I was the one who is always following his words, and that is why people thought we were in a relationship because I always tell them that he might not allow me to go whenever they ask). And how people had been calling him a user (which I wasn't aware of) when everything that I gave him were things he did not ask for (which is only PARTLY TRUE, some of the things I gave him were things he asked for specifically or things he made passive-aggresive comments about). 

That hurt me bad so I cut off all contact and blocked him in all of my SNS accounts after I found out that it wasn't the first time. Our mutual friends were actually always telling him off for talking behind my back, but he never stopped. A lot of people have heard him talking like that.  Although most did not believe him, it was still hurtful as a few did. I did not bother asking him personally, since any explanation wouldn't justify it. Here I was thinking that everything he did for me was genuine, as we were supposedly bestfriends, but if those were his thoughts, I would rather not deal with him as I have myself to take care of. I knew that I was hard to befriend and that dealing with me must be hard, but I thought he was being real with his sweetness and all. I didn't know I was actually paying him (from his perspective) to deal with me. 

Now recently, I went back to the place where we both used to work and I was bombarded by the people there with negative complaints about him.

About how he was a lazy person; he is like a robot that needs specific instructions to move but still does so badly. He was being insufferable and how he doesn't take accountability for his actions and responsibility for the outcomes. Now, these were all true, but I used to defend him. So everybody was surprised when I agreed and told them that he must be taught a lesson. I also found out that he is on the verge of being let go, and he wasn't allowed to stay in the dorms anymore. I would have cared and reasoned out with the dorm head like I did before, but this time, I did not even care.

I didn't know I was actually paying him (from his perspective) to deal with me. 

Now recently, I went back to the place where we both used to work and I was bombarded by the people there with negative complaints about him.

About how he was a lazy person; he is like a robot that needs specific instructions to move but still does so badly. He was being insufferable and how he doesn't take accountability for his actions and responsibility for the outcomes. Now, these were all true, but I used to defend him. So everybody was surprised when I agreed and told them that he must be taught a lesson. I also found out that he is on the verge of being let go, and he wasn't allowed to stay in the dorms anymore. I would have cared and reasoned out with the dorm head like I did before, but this time, I did not even care.

My mother said that if they did drinks for children I would have been able to go (they did have drinks for children because I checked on there website). It is now a week later and my mom was on about all of us going out to dinner for my sisters 18.

I was now annoyed.

My birthday was at the start of the month.(me and my sister live with our grandparents). My mom only came around for less than an hour to give me my gifts and left,later we went to a restaurant and my mom came. My grandpa payed for the whole thing.

Whenever I try to bring up the fact my siblings get treated way better than me my mom says ""I love you all the same"" or when I try and bring it up to my siblings all they say is how much harder their life's are than mine. My younger brother even says the he's the Favourite to annoy me and all my mom does is say ""he's playing"" 

I tried to talk with my mom about not wanting to go and saying ""it's a bit excessive to go out to dinner for her 18 when it was a week ago"" all I get in return is my mother telling me to stop being jealous and stop being an asshole.

Recently, my cousin, who wanted to buy me a big gift, asked me for advice on a computer he was supposedly buying for a “friend.” Knowing I’d done a ton of research, he asked for my suggestions, and I recommended something based on what he told me about his friend’s needs.

Turns out, this was all a setup. To surprise me, he bought *me* the computer I’d recommended for this “friend”—but he didn’t get the right configuration and never asked me about any specific choices. Now, I’m both grateful for the gesture and frustrated, since I’ll be using this computer constantly, and the setup isn’t ideal for my needs.

59,1gcg5n2,AITA for frequenting a local cafe where I am not welcome?,"There is a small local cafe in my neighborhood that is somewhat unordinary in that it functions as a kind of salon. The cafe owner hosts potluck parties, movie nights and birthdays at the cafe.

I've been going to this cafe for over a year, and at first I maintained the usual owner-customer relationship with the owner. Then I developed a crush on him and he seemed to notice. One time I was there alone late at night and the owner asked me out of the blue if I had feelings for him. I said no, and he joked ""please don't like me in that way,"" and I said I wouldn't, and he went ""how can you be so sure?"" which was strange.

After that I tried to keep a distance. About six weeks ago I was there and there was a new customer who was asking if the cafe only opens late at night. I said ""when it opens during the day I'm the only one here"" and the owner seemed miffed about this. So after the new customer left, I apologized.

The next day I woke up to a very, very long text from the owner. He said that what I had said the night before was way over the line. He then mentioned how I would say things like ""I wish it would be just us here"" when the cafe was filled with people I like, saying that that comment also felt to him like something that shouldn't be said. He then said ""if you can't understand or grasp what I am saying, please refrain from using our cafe.""

I sent an equally long apology to this text. I finished the apology by saying ""I will stop frequenting the cafe not because I don't understand what you said but to stop making mistakes that you will find uncomfortable.""

He replied to this with ""what I meant when I said to please refrain from using our cafe if you don't understand wasn't to tell you to stop coming; I knew you would become uncomfortable if I said that so I was making a last gesture of consideration for you. I value you very much as a friend and I like you a lot. feel free to visit again anytime you want.""

This left me confused, so I didn't reply to this last text. Then a week later there was a pre-scheduled potluck party at the cafe, which I didn't plan to go to. But then the day before the owner texted me asking me to come so I went.

I arrived a bit early, and the owner and I had a one-on-one about what we'd discussed before. He said he had nothing he was sorry for, and said ""this isn't gaslighting"" but that ""since you've seen me cut it off with other customers before you must know, but I don't usually explain things in such detail when I cut off people, I was doing you a favor since it's you."" I apologized for everything again and we ended it there.

After the potluck, I didn't visit the cafe for over a month. Yesterday I went for a coffee for the first time in over a month, and the owner was very cold.

My friend lets call her “A” whenever getting a boyfriend she all of a sudden wants nothing to do with me. This happened with her last ex who was super toxic. The guy she is currently with now is a wanted felon and he barley text her or calls her or anything, but she still has time to text him more than me. We are also within the same neighborhood but she still never sees me even after driving past my house several times. Getting back to the point-
Today was a party she had for her recent birthday and it was a pool party, she didnt wanna get in till her boyfriend arrived- even then she didnt get in the pool while everyone else was alr in the pool. She wasnt really present or talkative towards anyone really. Once the boyfriend came by she was ONLY with him and she only got into the pool after an hour of him being there due to the fact he had no clothes to change to. And the entire time she was ONLY with him. The last time she did this as well on her brothers birthday.
I called her out on it which led to a small argument due to the fact i feel left out in a sense of ive been with her since we were teens and now she wants to leave me and almost drop everything we have for a boy she hasnt truly been talking to for a month now?
She doesnt get to see him often and i understand but i feel like she could had been involved more and with EVERYONE?? And both her siblings and our other mutual friend agree that it was wrong of her but others have been telling me im in the wrong for arguing with her and causing a fight even tho we are likely to “resolve it” just because i forget doesnt mean ill forgive easily.

64,1gcee12,AITA for telling my friend not to be so emotionally needy?,"I told my friend not to be emotionally needy. This could make me an AH because I might have hurt his feelings after he confided in me about some of his personal problems.

I (41F) have a friend (44M) who I’ve known since university. He is married, no children, and has been together with his wife for about fifteen years, but they are not very sociable, and don’t seem to have a lot of close friends. He works a lot. I’m also married with young children. We used to see each other frequently during our studies and early married life, but with the children there has been less and less opportunity and now we might see each other once every few years or so. We live in a moderately sized town.

A little while ago, I visited the company where my friend works, in the corresponding department to where I work in my company. Naturally, I visited him, and he then accompanied me to meet his colleagues (about four or five of them, almost all female). After some friendly chit chat (as we all knew each other in some way or another, as I said, the town is not large) I eventually had the formal business part of the meeting, and my friend went back to his office.

Later on my friend confided in me that as a result of that preliminary social interaction, he realised that a lot of his feelings of being socially excluded at work were justified. He explained that he’d spent years trying to cultivate a professionally friendly relationship with his work colleagues, including those in that department, by taking a friendly interest in their personal and family lives, but seemed always unable to make a strong connection. 

He observed that I, from a completely different organisation, was able to come into the social environment and, within minutes, exchange “great to talk to you” vibes and have routine small talk about personal and family life, emotional engagement and social inclusion, in a way that he felt that he struggled with. My friend said it made him feel lonely, and he seemed quite despondent. He also said that he thought there was a gender element to the difference in treatment which he implied was a bit sexist and discriminatory. 

I told my friend that he was being a bit unreasonable. Of course as a female, I’m going to relate well with other women in those professional/ personal settings and have a lot more emotional engagement than is appropriate for him to expect, as a male. Men simply don’t relate to each other like women do and he shouldn’t expect to be part of that kind of interaction. I told him he was being overly emotionally needy, it probably contributed to any social rejection he was experiencing, and he should toughen up.

I told my friend not to be emotionally needy. This could make me an AH because I might have hurt his feelings after he confided in me about some of his personal problems.

I (41F) have a friend (44M) who I’ve known since university. He is married, no children, and has been together with his wife for about fifteen years, but they are not very sociable, and don’t seem to have a lot of close friends. He works a lot. I’m also married with young children. We used to see each other frequently during our studies and early married life, but with the children there has been less and less opportunity and now we might see each other once every few years or so. We live in a moderately sized town.

65,1gcedc7,AITA for refusing to write a college essay?,"I (24F) have always done well in school; doing my homework, studying, and getting good grades was never a struggle. I am now a middle school teacher.

My younger sister (17F) is a senior in high school and is currently struggling through college applications. Everyone in our family reminded her she should start thinking about them in the summer before her senior year but she kept pushing it off. She’s the type of student that cares about getting good grades but doesn’t care enough to do the work for it. I have spent countless evenings walking her through her math homework, which I don’t mind doing because I actually enjoy math (even when I have to look it up, reteach it to myself, and then teach it to her). As the years have gone by it’s gotten more and more frustrating to help her out because she will often refuse to sit down and watch what I’m doing or try it for herself.

Now she’s a week before her first college application deadline and she’s still workshopping her college essay. My parents have asked me and our other siblings to help her out (she’s the youngest so we’ve all already been through the college application process) and they’re putting more and more pressure on us as the deadline approaches because she’s procrastinated on it. I read her essay and it’s alright, but could be better. I made minor grammatical corrections as I read and left comments with guided feedback and suggestions of what she might add or remove to make the essay stronger. That wasn’t satisfying enough for my parents though and they wanted me to tell her exactly what to write, aka write it for her. 

As a teacher, my philosophy is that I teach kids how to do the work themselves. No one benefits from me handing the answers to them and I have stood by that philosophy since I was in high school tutoring my then elementary-year-old sister. The learned helplessness in children these days is astronomical and I’m not doing them any favors by encouraging it. I stood by that philosophy adamantly when my parents asked me to write the college essay for her.

His whole spiel is that he supports his whole family. This is not true. There are 5 working adults in his home. This man told roughly 30 people that I stole this shift from him. He reached out to two people, who don’t work in either of our departments, to ask for union contact information. Information I know he already had. Reddit, my feelings were so fucking hurt. And what got me is that he KNOWS the shifts are assigned by the supervisor!! His greedy little mean spirited self slandered me over something that wasn’t even my fault.

The manager asked if I would be willing to start my shift 3 hours early in order to ensure that he gets a break. I get to work at 3am and see no one behind our desk. I ask the guard what gives.

67,1gcdtos,AITA for refusing to reconnect with my siblings after my family has asked multiple times?,"Younger sibling = YS
Older sibling = OS

I am the middle child of three. When I was younger, me and my two other siblings were very close with each other. 

Years later OS moved cities and YS and I were sent to live with my father and grandma. During this time, I had a sort of depressive era, if you will. I stopped talking to my family, yelled at them a lot, had rlly bad mental problems, and because of that I eventually lost the close bond with YS.

I don't remember much from that time, but I know that I wasn't the best person and was kinda the asshole. The only 'excuse' I can really give is that I was a very young kid who didn't know better and was going through something they shouldn't have been at that age, but even then I feel like I could've handled my emotions better.

Anyway, present time, my pops (who's on the other side of my family and lives with OS) as well as my grandma want us to reconnect and become close siblings. 

I've said multiple times that I have no intention of fixing our relationships, but they've been insisting because ""having close siblings will help you in the future.""

I understand what they mean, but my siblings and I do not have anything in common. Even the jokes we make and opinions are completely different and I find myself wanting to argue with them a lot of the time. Most of their hobbies are the complete opposite of mine, and there isn't much of a middleground for me to properly connect with them.

A couple weeks ago, my pops came over for the weekend, sat me down, and asked me in an (almost, though I might've just percieved it that way) forceful manner that I should talk to my siblings. Again, I said no, but then they accused me of liking my friends more than I do with family and that not being close with them makes me a bad sibling.

The part about liking my friends more is true. I admit that I love my friends a whole lot more than I do with my family, and that if it came down to it, I'd choose my friends. My friends are much more important in my life than my family is.

When I affirmed that I would not talk to my siblings, he got upset at me and then told me of how OS cried after their brother in-law ignored them for his friends, and that I would be hurting both OS and YS feelings.

We haven't talked since. 

I would like to point out that OS does like me and wants to be close to both YS and I, but YS and I have little to no relationship with each other. We simply live in the same house. I don't particularly enjoy OS's company because they tend to push their hobbies on me, and whenever I hang out with YS they make rude and snarky comments towards everyone around them, including their friends (which is a big no-no for me.)

I'd really like some honest feedback here cause I feel like I'm bias and I'm unsure of whether I'm the AH or something else.

EDIT: Thank you guys a lot for letting me know that what I'm doing is AH behaviour.

I, (16F), and my best friend Allie, (16F) are babysitting for some of my cousins tonight. She asked me to get her some Dr. Pepper. I am extremely sleep deprived due to school and having to get up extra early today for a test. I also have decently bad ADHD, meaning sometimes I don't pay attention or remember things the best. My medication for ADHD had worn off by then. Allie is undiagnosed but I am 99% sure she is autistic. She's working on getting diagnosed but she is also pretty sure she's autistic. I'm not completely sure if this is a part of the autism or what but she is a germaphobe. Specifically of saliva and backwash from ANYONE. Allie has made that clear to me throughout our entire friendship. 

When Allie asked me to get her Dr. Pepper, I first checked in the fridge where there was an already opened Dr. Pepper bottle, I saw no other Dr. Peppers in there at that point so I thought that had to be the one she said she saw. That wildly incorrect assumption was made under sleep deprivation and ADHD impulsivity. I was a bit confused, but brushed it off completely because of my sleep deprivation. I knew Allie would absolutely not drink out of a used bottle so I poured her drink into a seperate cup. When I returned to the room, she asked if this was a new cup, I still am not sure why she asked that. She then drank out of it. She then asked if I used the Dr. Pepper from the fridge, I said yes.

She freaked out, she went to the bathroom, forced herself to throw up twice, brushed her teeth twice, then went and talked to her parents on the phone and came back into the room with tears all over her face. She then asked me why I did that and why didn't I tell her that it came from an opened bottle before she drank out of it, and that I should know better. I said it was an accident and that I'm ridiculously tired and  I thought she had changed her mindset or something and I didn't see any other Dr. Peppers. She then told me that she had specifically told me to get one from underneath the counter that hadn't been opened. I did not hear that at all and I had no memory of that. She honestly probably did say that and I was just not paying attention. 

I feel so bad, I know this is a big deal for her and it took YEARS to gain any trust from her. This will probably set us back so far and she's so mad at me.

It was difficult but I had support from both of my lovely parents. Their father is not in the picture, but I like to think I've done well with the kids.

I'm a medical receptionist and my parents were kind enough to let us initially live in the family home with them. They adored helping out with the kids and we're really close. I spent ten years saving money for a house deposit (so I didn't have to get a massive mortgage) and ended up getting a house down the road from my parents. I got very lucky and the mortgage is already paid off.

Anyway, my son is a 2nd year plumbing apprentice and lives at home. His plan is to keep living at home to save money while he does his apprenticeship, especially since the pay is pretty poor.

My daughter, wants to study music, and eventually get a masters in education so she can be a music teacher. I think it's great plan that I completely support it. The issue is that she wants to attend a specific university in the city. Its a 3 hour drive from our house and she will need to move out if she wants to attend there.

She has a lot of friends in that area from doing sports and band, and most of them are going to this university.

But I'm worried about her moving out, studying and working a part time job that will barely cover her weekly rent, let alone utilities, groceries, car expenses etc. 

A lot of her friends parents, are going to help financially support them through the first year, by covering rent. I could technically afford it. After taxes and weekly expenses, I put away about $300 a week in savings. This is what I dip into for family holidays, my own leisure activities, Christmas/birthdays and general life surprise costs.

She wants me to contribute $90-100 per week to help her out, and I don't want to. Maybe I'm being selfish? But I like where I've managed to get to with my life after a really rocky start. I like my lifestyle. I love going on big holidays trips with family and friends, little nights away with my close friends, going to the gym, going to art classes, having a weekly cleaner etc.

I know its very rich white lady of me, but I'm happy and finally starting to get back into dating after some rough events in the past.

There is a university closer to home, only a 20min drive away where she can study music and do her education degree. And I'm more than happy to have her live here rent free while she does it, including covering groceries and everything I've always done.

My parents are retired (they had me late in life) and don't really understand the situation. So they aren't much help. My daughter is really upset with me because she says I'm crushing her dreams. She has plenty of friends here, and even if she wanted to go a bit further out there to meet new people, there is another uni 45mins away and 1.5hours away.

She wants me to contribute $90-100 per week to help her out, and I don't want to. Maybe I'm being selfish? But I like where I've managed to get to with my life after a really rocky start. I like my lifestyle. I love going on big holidays trips with family and friends, little nights away with my close friends, going to the gym, going to art classes, having a weekly cleaner etc.

I know its very rich white lady of me, but I'm happy and finally starting to get back into dating after some rough events in the past.

There is a university closer to home, only a 20min drive away where she can study music and do her education degree. And I'm more than happy to have her live here rent free while she does it, including covering groceries and everything I've always done.

My parents are retired (they had me late in life) and don't really understand the situation. So they aren't much help. My daughter is really upset with me because she says I'm crushing her dreams. She has plenty of friends here, and even if she wanted to go a bit further out there to meet new people, there is another uni 45mins away and 1.5hours away.

70,1gcdk67,AITA for not giving my ex money back ,"So me and my ex split up, not so amicably. They just had stopped talking to me for nearly a week (after we had been together for over a year, he was supposed to move in less than a month later) and then had texted me that he wanted to break up. No warning, no signs, just break up. 12 hours later he called me saying he was upset and that he was overwhelmed, and felt like he had thrown away our whole future over just personal stuff. I told him I really didn’t know how I felt and that we would need a bit of time. Flash forward 3 days later he ended up saying it was a waste of time and we shouldn’t keep trying to fix this, which I respected. 2 days later I find out from a mutual friend that he had been cheating on me with someone else, while being at my apartment when I was working. I confronted my ex, and he threw it in my face that he had been cheating, and that he didn’t regret it. I told him that I didn’t want my stuff back (it was just hoodies and stuff), but I’d like the keys to my apartment back. He stayed for at least a week or two minimum a month, so I had let him have a copy to be able to let himself in and out. He proceeds to ask for the bit over $100 back he had given me the prior month to help out with utilities and groceries. I informed him that he can get that back when he mails me back my keys or gives them to me. He keeps saying that the money is more important than the keys to my apartment. I personally have put my foot down on this, considering he only pays rent to his mother, and that’s the only bills he has, so finances aren’t an issue for him, and never were for our relationship. I am just wondering if I am wrong for holding this to the standard I am? It’s been over two months, no keys, I have had the locks changed (I don’t think he’d try anything, but just for the next person who moves in) which came out of my pocket, and he continues to ask for the money back. 

Btw: just added how we broke up for context, it was extremely sudden, and unexpected. I would 1000% give the money back the second I received the keys, but he has a history of not keeping up to his word with things, and getting the locks changed was a $250 bill from my apartment complex.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-26,"AITA for not giving my ex money back  So me and my ex split up, not so amicably.

71,1gcdeys,WIBTA if I advised my boyfriend not to go to a friend’s wedding?,"Me (29) and my boyfriend Will (32) have been together for 4.5 years. Recently, we received an invite to his high school/college friend’s wedding, who we’ll call Stacy (32f). I’ve heard of Stacy throughout our relationship, just mostly him telling stories of high school/college days, but he has mentioned that they haven’t spoken in 7 years now, so almost double the time that Will and I have been together. 

Will was definitely surprised to receive an invite to her wedding, considering they haven’t really communicated in so long (“fell off the face of the earth, as he says). He has mentioned that she had some struggles, not sure what, but I can relate because I’ve gone radio silence when I feel overwhelmed and my mental health has taken a toll, but not 7 years of silence. Additionally, Stacy asked Will to be her wedding photographer. Will isn’t a professional photographer but has dabbled in photography. 

I personally found it odd that someone who hasn’t given Will the time of day in 7 years all of a sudden pops up and says “hey please come to my wedding, get me a gift from my registry, and be one of my vendors for free”. I want to advice him to say no just because my boyfriend is extremely generous and kind and I don’t want him to be taken advantage of, and this situation feels like the invite is a bit disingenuous. I get that wedding vendors are expensive, it’s just the fact of such a huge ask for free when she hasn’t m tried to be in Will’s life and he’s tried repeatedly to no avail. Of course, if he agrees to going and photographing, I will go with him and have a good time as it’s ultimately his decision. He’s already teetering on the decision so it’s not like me saying this is really coming out of left field, I just don’t want to come across as rude or AH behavior for voicing my opinion. 

To clarify some things: 

1. No this is not a jealousy thing or anything about him being around girls. I’m quite secure in our relationship and honestly find no reason to be jealous or think anything’s going on or has gone on. 

2. She has communicated with other friends they had in common in the 7 years of radio silence with Will, but hasn’t responded to Will in any meaningful capacity from what I have been told by him. They are FB but that’s really all I know. 

3. I will not phrase it as “Stacy is a b, “Stacy doesn’t care about you” or anything I just wanna say “hey I get that you’ve had good memories and a good rapport previously and that’s awesome, but to me, it feels a bit of a disingenuous gesture considering she hasn’t tried to keep in contact all these years despite you trying to reach out.

72,1gcdeuj,AITA for telling my future SIL I was pissed that her dog gave us fleas?,"My fiancé (25M) and I (30F) are getting married at the end of the month, but his sister (19F) has ghosted us after we told her we weren't happy about her dog bringing fleas to their parents' house. 

Background: My fiancé is American, and I’m Canadian. We’re signing our marriage paperwork this month in Canada with just family and a few friends. His parents can't make it due to document issues, but his sister planned to drive two hours to join us because she has her enhanced license. 

Three weeks ago, we visited his parents and his mom informed us the evening we got to their house that his sister's dog had brought fleas into their home, and all 3 dogs in the house now have them. We weren't in a financial position to get a hotel, so we just stayed at their house for the week. His mom told us that his sister had been taking her dog back and forth from her ex's new house, 1 week on 1 week off type of thing, since they broke up. This is because his sister's ex has a dog who gets anxiety without the other dog being there since they broke up. Her ex recently just moved into a new house, which is where we think the fleas came from, as this is the only real change that's occurred that could potentially be the culprit. (both myself and my fiancé have been back and forth from his parents house several times over the 5 years we've been dating, and not once until now, have we brought fleas back. His parents have also been living there for 10 years and neither of their 2 dogs have had fleas). After a week of being there, we noticed flea bites on us. A day after we got home I found a flea hopping off one of our cats. We ended up steam cleaning our carpet and every other fabric thing in our apartment. 

I messaged his sister on snapchat about the fleas and expressed my frustration, hoping for some kind of acknowledgment. Instead, she got defensive, said that it wasn't her dog and that he ""didn't have fleas""...?? she argued it ""couldn’t be her fault, her ex's place doesn't even have carpet"". I let her know that I wasn't arguing with her, because it happened, it's a thing, but that I'm upset about it. I would have taken a simple ""I'm sorry that happened"" and would have been just fine. But instead she let our 556 day snapchat streak die (important because she's young and usually keeps a very close eye on her streaks, even my partner's mom was shocked when I told her she let the streak die) and left me on read. 

Now, she’s ignored both of us for almost four weeks and hasn’t confirmed if she’s coming to our marriage signing. I’m hurt that she’s icing us out over this situation, but especially because that's her big brother and he's getting married.

78,1gcckd2,AITA for refusing to cancel plans for my sister's wedding?,"My sister told me this week that she and her partner are planning to have a small wedding ceremony on December 14th with just our immediate family (our parents, younger brother, and me). I've had a joint holiday party with my best friend planned for two months on that weekend, plus other holiday events that I've already RSVP'd to/paid for, including a few for work. My parents and brother are in the same boat, with work obligations, plus relatives and friends visiting for the holiday. We would all have to travel for her wedding (either hours by car or by plane), so we can't just arrive and leave within a day or even a weekend.

We encouraged her to wait until January or February, but she refused. She called us all selfish, and said that if we really loved her, we would cancel our plans for her wedding. This made our mom cry, so I called my sister and said that she was the selfish one for making last minute plans for her wedding during the busiest season of the year, disregarding everyone else and demanding that we cancel everything for her. She said I was the AH, because I wasn't being supportive of her wedding and refusing to cancel plans with friends for her. I am pretty sure of my argument, but her words have been eating away at me. Am I the AH?

Edit: First of all, thank you for your advice and support! Also, to answer a few questions I've seen in the comments:

1. No, my sister isn't pregnant. I asked her directly, and she said no. I guess she could be lying, but (in my experience) she is a bad liar, and she seemed honest when we spoke.
2. She hasn't been overly manipulative or demanding in the past, which is why I've been really questioning my stance. I think she genuinely believes she's in the right here.

I have not lived in the same city as my parents since I was 14, so this is a big change for all of us.  I am taking time off of work for the year to spend time with my kids, and thought it would be great for them to also be able to spend more time with my parents.  So even though financially I am able to live elsewhere, I decided to move back to my hometown and into my parents house.  

My mother and I do not have a good relationship and it has been difficult being home to say the least.  However the kids are really enjoying the time with her so i am trying to stick it out.  

Today, after picking my son (M 3) up at school at 12:30pm, I took him and my younger son (M 1) to a halloween pumpkin patch/amusement park near our house.  We were at the pumpkin patch from \~1-4:30pm and got home before 5pm.  My mom got very upset with me when I got home and told me I needed to communicate more and should tell her if I am going to be out.  I asked ""why?"" and this made her much more upset and she screamed at me and called me obnoxious in front of my kids.

I really feel that I am an adult and if I decide to take my kids out for a few hours I don't need to report back.  We did not have any plans and there was no reason for her to expect me to come home.

81,1gccbiz,AITAH For Not Cutting My Husband More Slack?,"I (32F) got married to my husband (40M) 7 years ago and we currently have a 5 year old son. My husband is a physician. He works very long hours during the week and is on-call for a week at a time every few months. He provides financially for my son and I and has never had any expectations that I work. Since the beginning of our marriage, I took on the cleaning, cooking, shopping, laundry, etc for the house since my husband worked so much. Once I had our son, I took care of him 100% of the time since my husband was either at work or sleeping after a long day. 

I decided a few years ago that I wanted to go back to school to become a nurse practitioner. The program is 2 years long and very rigorous. My husband was supportive of my decision and has even paid my tuition each semester so I didn’t have to take out loans (something I appreciate so much). However, since my husband provides so generously for our family, he has viewed my decision to go back to school as more of a hobby than anything else. I continue to be the one who takes care of all the cleaning, cooking, shopping, and laundry at home (my husband has offered to hire a cleaning company once a month to help out). I am also solely in charge of our son’s school pickup and drop off, meals, bedtime, and everything else in between while also trying to study and make it to classes. If my son is sick, which is often since starting a new school, it is my responsibility to figure out alternative childcare for the day or miss my classes. My husband is a very present father and loves our son, but doesn’t take on much of his responsibilities due to his busy schedule. We do not live near any family. We have sitters we’ve used in the past, but they are rarely available without a few days heads up, understandably. 

Our relationship has gotten rocky over the past year. My husband gives most of his energy to his work, and while he comes home always trying to make the effort of being a present husband and father, his fuse is short. If we’re speaking and I disagree with him or get upset by something he says/does, his response is that I should let him say whatever he wants since I know how busy his weeks are. He holds grudges for days over the most trivial things. There are times he gets offended during a regular conversation and I will be left trying to figure out what upset him. When I try to explain to him that I too am feeling stretched out thin during this time, his response is that I have no reason to feel stressed since I chose to go to school on my own free will and have no real responsibilities otherwise. I try to explain to him that he has no responsibilities outside of his work since I take care of everything else, but to no avail. 

I am genuinely not sure anymore if I have a right to be upset by his actions or if I’m being the AH for not cutting him more slack than I already do, given how hard he works.

83,1gcc14m,WIBTA for not inviting my stepsibling to my small wedding next year?,"Throwaway account because I'm not sure if my stepsibling (SS) has reddit? I'll keep the genders neutral as well!

My SS and I have a large age gap and did not grow up together. They were working across the country when I started living our parents. One of SS's parents passed away so my stepparent is their only parent and it's the same for me. I lived with my stepparent (SP) from a young age and in my culture, it's common to call non-strangers ""uncle name"" or ""aunt name"". And this is how I call my stepparent to this day (important later). I only see SS once a year for the holidays so SS feels like a distant relative. However I was in the wedding party of SS's wedding when I was a teen due to SS's spouse's insistence. 

SP and SS have a very good relationship, and that has evolved to SS and my parent (P) having a strained relationship. P has expressed to me that SS treats P like a servant and P is always dreading when SS comes to visit. 

Over the years, I have tried to get P to see SS's side or communicate with SS in case there is some misunderstanding. P has tried and never treats SS badly. P consistently buys SS birthday, holiday presents and is the main one who prepares the guest rooms for SS and family.

When I moved out, I didn't see SS for a few years. SS often dropped of their child (C) to go on vacation when C was a baby so I saw C a lot. As a baby, C learned from SP to call P ""grandparent"". Recently I went to visit parents' house for the holidays and I noticed C kept ordering P around and using P's name instead of ""grandparent"". But SS's spouse insisted on C calling me ""uncle/aunt name"" because it was ""rude"". C eventually called me uncle/aunt but continued to call P with their name. When I asked P privately about it, P was upset about it because it made P feel like an outsider but P didn't want to ruin the holiday.

When I went back home, I messaged SS to asked if it was possible for C to call P either grandparent or ""Uncle/Aunt"" like how C calls me or how I call SP. SS agreed immediately and I thought that was it. 

I later find out that SP and P had a HUGE divorce level argument  over this because SS told SP that I bullied SS for C using P's name and P defended me. That really annoyed me because I felt that SS and I should have been able to talk it out.

Because of this family dynamic, I don't want to invite SS to my wedding. SP sort of knows this and has not said anything. Generally SP and I are on good terms even though we're not super close, but I know this decision would further divide our sides of the family. 

My other relatives feel like it would be a huge no-no to not invite SS and family to my microwedding (40ppl). My partner and I will be paying for everything so we're not relying on SP or P and I want everyone to have a pleasant time, but I'm not sure if P can have a good time if SS is there, given how SS treats P and how I am still a little annoyed about SS blowing up the name-calling situation with C.

85,1gcbmrc,AITA for telling my brother I won’t change myself to make him happy .,"Sigh .

Okay , hi . I never expected to like , actually do this but I’m desperate I guess .

I refuse to name anyone as I want to protect their privacy , thanks :)

Before all of this happened , me and my baby brother was playing Minecraft . And rebuilding houses in villages .

BB was using Cherry Logs and stuff , as he was copying me , my little brother ( 12M ) was . . . repulsed by this . . . ? He was constantly saying like “ Nooo BB don’t use pink „ or “ Bro use another colour , not pink „ or whatever . I quickly told LB to just shut up and leave BB alone , ‘cause he seemed happy just copying what I was doing with the building and constantly turning to me for approval .

LB was just saying shit and told me I was gonna BB into a femboy ???? A bit more bickering and LB suddenly just attacked me as a person ?  He attacked my liking for Kieran and said that I’ve never acted like this until I became obsessed with Kieran and I’ve changed and showing a clear distaste .

I’ve explained to LB that I’ve been this way since I’ve come out the womb , I’m not really any different . He’s just seeing the full extent of my personality , and is obviously not liking it . But LB was like “ no he’s not like you „ or “ y’all have nothing in common . ” Which I combated with , “ If you do not see the similarities between me and Kieran , you don’t know me . ” Which made LB say , “ Of course I know you , you’re my sister , I’ve known you my whole life !! „

Also at this point , Mama came into the living room and was just sitting there , listening , not doing anything to stop the argument .

Okay , hi . I never expected to like , actually do this but I’m desperate I guess .

I refuse to name anyone as I want to protect their privacy , thanks :)

Before all of this happened , me and my baby brother was playing Minecraft . And rebuilding houses in villages .

BB was using Cherry Logs and stuff , as he was copying me , my little brother ( 12M ) was . . . repulsed by this . . . ? He was constantly saying like “ Nooo BB don’t use pink „ or “ Bro use another colour , not pink „ or whatever . I quickly told LB to just shut up and leave BB alone , ‘cause he seemed happy just copying what I was doing with the building and constantly turning to me for approval .

LB was just saying shit and told me I was gonna BB into a femboy ???? A bit more bickering and LB suddenly just attacked me as a person ?  He attacked my liking for Kieran and said that I’ve never acted like this until I became obsessed with Kieran and I’ve changed and showing a clear distaste .

I’ve explained to LB that I’ve been this way since I’ve come out the womb , I’m not really any different . He’s just seeing the full extent of my personality , and is obviously not liking it . But LB was like “ no he’s not like you „ or “ y’all have nothing in common . ” Which I combated with , “ If you do not see the similarities between me and Kieran , you don’t know me . ” Which made LB say , “ Of course I know you , you’re my sister , I’ve known you my whole life !! „

Also at this point , Mama came into the living room and was just sitting there , listening , not doing anything to stop the argument .

More bickering later , LB went into his blankets and started crying , which I immediately became concerned and asked if he was okay . He had said “ You’re not my sister . . . „ All because he didn’t recognize how I acted .

My father and her got separated while I was very young and I understand she had to experience lots of difficulties. The thing is I've been extremely understanding for years now ever since I was a kid I've always been told by family to be understanding, mature, be her pillar. Now I endured all of it but recently I've reached a breaking point. I've tried to be sooo understanding that her childhood trauma has caused her to be this way and that she is a human too. But recently I've been growing more and more tired of dismissing her actions. I am 18 I work a job and I try hard to keep myself motivated. 

My mother hasnt worked a consistent job for the past 7 years. We moved to a new country and things happened so I give her that. Let's say she hasn't been working at all for about 4 years now almost 5. During all these times I've been grateful that we had support in other ways. I've always been there for her and told her she'll do good but recently I've realized she doesn't want to. After I've turned 18 suddenly people keep telling me to be an adult as if I haven't been like one for so many years and now it feels like I'm raising a 50 something year old child. She learned some stupid courses without doing proper research about how much it will pay and all that. 

When I tell her these things I'm painted as a bad daughter and end up getting blamed because I didn't do anything to help her. Somehow I'm expected to everything for her and spoonfeed her everything. She cannot even use google or YouTube to find basic things and when I refuse because I'm genuinely just tired of being there for everyone while I myself have no one to help or guide me actually I've never HAD anyone. AITA for lashing out at her and her actions multiple times and telling her that she needs to act like an adult in this world and she needs to be responsible in support the child she decided to birth? now she says I'm 18 and have a job why should I relay on her to take care of me. Is it wrong to be frustrated that I never got to be a child and I finally just want to not be so responsible and want a parent to be there for me. I genuinely have a problem with her more because I don't have anyone to guide me I've been spending my whole childhood being there for these adult children.

Right now I'm just shamed as someone who is blaming her poor mother who just wants some help from her daughter for little things and her daughter who is just arrogant because she can use technology and knows more stuff.

Frank constantly makes offensive jokes or sexual jokes. Annoyingly often to be honest. I didn't think or have any reason to believe he was even religious at all. He had never mentioned it either.

Today, however, before benching 25ish kilograms (we were 2/3 through class and had done plenty other lifting before this) he randomly prayed...? Like to lift this 25 kgs, he prayed. He had never done that before.

And he got real pissed and said he took his religion seriously and me questioning his prayer was insanely disrespectful. Mind you, he is constantly disrespectful to anyone and everyone (gay people, people with mental disabilities, makes jokes about 9/11, etc)

Yesterday he pulled weeds and today the Amazon guy who delivered my packages found a wallet in my driveway. He tucked it under the packages and left me a doorbell message. 

I got home from work and took the wallet inside with my packages and the ID in it belonged to the kid who pulls my weeds. 

I figured he must have dropped it and walked it back to his house (he lives a couple streets over). The dad (I’m assuming) answered the door and took the wallet. He opened the wallet and there was a $100 bill inside. He took it out and gave it to me to “teach the kid a lesson” bc apparently the kid loses a lot of stuff and had been in a “pissy” mood about not being able to find his wallet. I tried to refuse but he insisted I take it. It was awkward, so I did. 

Now, I feel like $100 is an expensive lesson to learn as a teenager. But I don’t know what to do? 

If I return it, then I’m undermining the parent’s lesson. 

If I keep it, I kind of feel like I would be an AH bc it’s money that belonged to a child and he may have worked to earn it.

My partner is very particular about how he likes things done.

She became increasingly frustrated with me, threatened to hurt me physically (multiple times), raising her voice and insisting I stop pushing my point. At first, I let it go, but I stayed calm and continued to explain my side, thinking we could have a rational discussion.



Each time I tried to clarify, she seemed to get more upset, and her tone became harsher. I, all along, kept my tone level so that things did not turn ugly. Finally, when she gave the final warning, I calmly asked her, ""Why does it have to turn into this kind of reaction over something like this?"" And that's when things really escalated.



I’m 19 now, and while I know I had my own issues as a kid, I still remember being disciplined pretty strictly for things like school and behavior. I understand why she did it back then, but it’s something that stuck with me, and the intensity of this argument brought back some of those memories.



When I asked why the conversation had to turn heated, she replied, “I’m your mother; I can say whatever I want,” and “You should know these things at your age.” I probably should have let the argument go there, but I continued to (calmly) point out that this wasn’t a respectful way to have a debate. I even mentioned that she was setting an example for me about how to handle disagreements, and that it wasn’t something I’d want to pass on if I have kids someday. She didn’t respond to this and just kept scolding me, saying her mother treated her the same way at my age and that I’m part of a “sensitive” generation that can’t handle criticism.



She also brought up that I’m disrespectful in general and that she’s been more patient with me than she needs to be. To which I replied that I really improved during the years, and that we don't argue/shout as much as we used to, she dismissed that and told me how I use rough language with my friends and that I don't mind it. I explained it's different with friends because we know it is light-hearted, but she didn't seem to care or even understand.



Then she started bringing up our family’s financial struggles, saying she has the right to “vent” her frustrations through anger and can speak to me however she wants. Finally, she ended the argument by saying that she “knows for a fact” I won’t take care of her when she’s older, which honestly hurt a lot. I always thought I might hold onto a small grudge against my mom for the past, but hearing her assume I’d just abandon her in her old age really stung.

To which I replied that I really improved during the years, and that we don't argue/shout as much as we used to, she dismissed that and told me how I use rough language with my friends and that I don't mind it. I explained it's different with friends because we know it is light-hearted, but she didn't seem to care or even understand.



Then she started bringing up our family’s financial struggles, saying she has the right to “vent” her frustrations through anger and can speak to me however she wants. Finally, she ended the argument by saying that she “knows for a fact” I won’t take care of her when she’s older, which honestly hurt a lot. I always thought I might hold onto a small grudge against my mom for the past, but hearing her assume I’d just abandon her in her old age really stung.

  
This might just be a stupid post but I'm quiet frankly tired of it. All our arguments end up us not talking for days at end and when I finally decide to be calm and explain to her why she shouldn't say the things she said, I become the bad guy in her eyes.",0.0,0.017032996,0,1

This stems a lot from the fact he'd told me he'd cheated on me in the past, but taken it back and said it was untrue.

We were managing steadily but yesterday drove me off the walls. I asked him to screenshare his Instagram dms and he obliged and showed me a couple chats. Then, we reached 'Lara's' chat with him. My bf & Lara have been friends for a couple years since they went to the same school and now uni.

Once he opened the chat, I instantly saw flirty messages and use of 'babes' to address each other along with added kisses - 'xx'. These were along sent whilst we have been together.

I immediately started asking him asking him why on earth he would do this when I'm the only girl he should be talking like this to. He does this to his male best friend, and I have no issue with it since he's open about it and it's very obviously a joke. But he has never ever talked about Lara's existence, and has never brought this up to me before.

He said that it's just them joking about and I have no reason to be upset over it. He did apologise at first, saying he wouldn't talk like that to her again. Then he got extremely defensive when I asked him to block her and called me unreasonable. I told him they could talk IRL just not on insta. He said they're not close and they barely see each other in person nowadays. I acknowledged that and told him that I'd still want him to block her. He kept refusing to and this went on for hours. I got so stressed I started crying and he laughed in my face numerous times, saying him blocking her 'is just so ridiculous.' 

I kept repeating how they're not very close and this really hurt me and I'd feel much more comfortable with Lara blocked, so why was he so insistent on telling me I'm unreasonable for asking and expecting that from him?

When I had first brought up getting the cat my roommate was very excited about it and even pitched in $30 when i went to adopt her. Before i went through with adopting my cat, I had clarified that she would be adopted under my name and would stay in my room. When i was home, i would leave my door open and let the kitty roam while i go about my business, this is usually when my roommate would see her and interact with her.

It doesn’t seem like a lot of work but it is very time consuming and I have a ton of inventory of my own that I still have to post as well. The fight began when she asked if I could post a few things for her.

100,1gc9gxp,AITA for not giving my ex roommates back their things because they didn’t get their stuff in time and I’m in the process of moving?,"I (23 F), my roommate (24 M) and my boyfriend (31 M) all allowed two other roommates (27 M and 20 F) to live with us for two months. At first, things were ok. They were going to get jobs and contribute, but the job they got didn’t pay them a dime the entire time they “worked” there. We told them to get jobs to pay rent. They didn’t pay rent the first month. We let them have one more month. They didn’t contribute a dime. They also ate $700 of food and only bought food for themselves when they had unemployment money come in (because they could get that due to not being paid). They would buy food and cook it in front of us without offering us anything. They damaged our walls. Broke our AC due to having a window unit due to having a chinchilla. Made our electric bill go up to $500 because of said chinchilla and snake. They brought in five animals in total under “service animals” laws (god only knows how they passed those off). They didn’t pay any rent at all, and didn’t pay the electric bill. 

We finally kicked them out in September, and they called the police on us because they “didn’t have enough time to move their shit”. They got their animals, and we put in a police report that they need to have their stuff out by the 15th of October, giving them a 30 day notice. Well, fast forward to the weekend before the end date, they text us saying they need to come get their stuff. None of us were going to be home the day they needed it, told them to come by Sunday. They didn’t want to because a moving company couldn’t help them on Sundays (ok? Not my problem). They called the cops on us again because we “weren’t agreeing to the terms” according to the cop. I finally told him that I would change my anniversary date just so they could come get their stuff. Then they tell me they can’t come get it because “it was not in their budget” (THEN WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A SCENE IN THE FIRST PLACE???) I told him that he wasted my time and to not come here at all. 

Fast forward to tonight. We are in the middle of packing because we need to leave this place (it’s too big and we can’t afford it anymore). We hear a knock on our door and it’s the male roommate. We will call him C. My boyfriend (B) went to the door and told him to leave. I came out and saw what was going on, and told him to leave immediately. We had already thrown out half of his stuff at this point because we have to move, and can’t lug around all his crap. 

I proceed to call the cops, saying that they are harassing us and won’t leave us alone after the date they had to get their stuff. The police came, and basically told us to haul all of their stuff out onto the porch and return it. I tell them that it is in a police report that they needed to come get their stuff before the 15th.

I (23 F), my roommate (24 M) and my boyfriend (31 M) all allowed two other roommates (27 M and 20 F) to live with us for two months. At first, things were ok. They were going to get jobs and contribute, but the job they got didn’t pay them a dime the entire time they “worked” there. We told them to get jobs to pay rent. They didn’t pay rent the first month. We let them have one more month. They didn’t contribute a dime. They also ate $700 of food and only bought food for themselves when they had unemployment money come in (because they could get that due to not being paid). They would buy food and cook it in front of us without offering us anything. They damaged our walls. Broke our AC due to having a window unit due to having a chinchilla. Made our electric bill go up to $500 because of said chinchilla and snake. They brought in five animals in total under “service animals” laws (god only knows how they passed those off). They didn’t pay any rent at all, and didn’t pay the electric bill. 

We finally kicked them out in September, and they called the police on us because they “didn’t have enough time to move their shit”. They got their animals, and we put in a police report that they need to have their stuff out by the 15th of October, giving them a 30 day notice. Well, fast forward to the weekend before the end date, they text us saying they need to come get their stuff. None of us were going to be home the day they needed it, told them to come by Sunday. They didn’t want to because a moving company couldn’t help them on Sundays (ok? Not my problem). They called the cops on us again because we “weren’t agreeing to the terms” according to the cop. I finally told him that I would change my anniversary date just so they could come get their stuff. Then they tell me they can’t come get it because “it was not in their budget” (THEN WHY DID YOU MAKE SUCH A SCENE IN THE FIRST PLACE???) I told him that he wasted my time and to not come here at all. 

Fast forward to tonight. We are in the middle of packing because we need to leave this place (it’s too big and we can’t afford it anymore). We hear a knock on our door and it’s the male roommate. We will call him C. My boyfriend (B) went to the door and told him to leave. I came out and saw what was going on, and told him to leave immediately. We had already thrown out half of his stuff at this point because we have to move, and can’t lug around all his crap. 

I proceed to call the cops, saying that they are harassing us and won’t leave us alone after the date they had to get their stuff. The police came, and basically told us to haul all of their stuff out onto the porch and return it. I tell them that it is in a police report that they needed to come get their stuff before the 15th. It is the 25th now. They had ample time. The cops then told me that they would be seeking legal action against us. AITA?",0.0,0.008291412,0,1

102,1gc9b8z,AITA for yelling at my friend about refusing to draw for them anymore?,"I have a friend named Sen (not real name for safety reasons) we recently met this year. She is pretty hyperactive, I'm I'm pretty sure somewhere on the spectrum (although she says other wise). She really likes to write stories, and recently she had made the story idea for two characters, one being based on a dark academia aesthetic, and the other being based on a kid core aesthetic (as well as her trying to nerodivergent code them but I digress) anyway, I like to draw, and have spent way to long researching character design. So she asks one day at lunch if I could draw her characters for her. I said sure because she was a friend and why not. It was just going to be a quick bust doodle because that's all I'll do for free anymore (I've had art theift problems in the past). She immediately tried to insist I make a full body which already made me not want to, but luckily she backed down after I said no a few times.

Today I finished up both characters in our math class. The first one (the dark academia one) she liked and thought was cute. I was glad she liked it, but I personally didn't like it because I've made and seen to many characters that are the exact same thing. She had given me very little to work with physical description wise so I had to shit ball it. But anyway, on the second one, the kidcore based one, it was... Different. I liked it more, even though it had less effort. Again it was just a doodle, and if she asked I'd be willing to adjust. 
But no. She looked at it, looked at me, and looked back at the drawing, and the first thing she said was ""you can remake it at lunch"" that HURT. Not only did she hate it (which is kinda whatever) but she did it very condescendingly, AND not only that, she EXPECTED me to remake it??? I obviously got pissed. Especially because she KNOWS I'm kinda protective of my art, esp art that's more original than fanart. So it HURT.
I got pissed and said ""well it's not my fucking fault you gave me a dirt ass description chalk full of ADHD stereotypes that are purposeful."" I admit, I was really rude. I do regret being as rude as I was. But then, she just kept doubling down, saying she'll write more and have me remake it. I was BEYOND infuriated. I stormed out once the bell rang. 
Then comes lunch. I usually sit with the same group. One guy, let's call him Lee, specifically, and Sen usually joins us. 
We sit, and usually lunch is where I destress, and partly vent because Lee actually listens to me. 
And as usual, Sen sits across, and almost IMMEDIATELY pulls out her writing folder and says ""I wrote more so you can redraw it-"" and I LOST IT. Almost at the top of my fucking lungs I yelled at her I wasn't going to make one more god damned thing for her if she had the audacity to be a doushe, and if I was, she was gonna pay me. It shut her up, and she didn't talk the rest of lunch.

103,1gc985c,AITA for not letting my best friend call me toxic and annoying?,"My best friend of four years, ""Em"" (19f) and I (19f) recently had a huge falling out.

Basically, I was having a slight argument with another friend, ""Cal"", (which we have since resolved), and I was talking to Em to process the argument. While I know that's not the most healthy thing, that was the nature of our relationship for four years. 

However, Em used the chance to air out all of her issues with me. While I was explaining the conversation, she basically said that I deserved to be yelled at. While I did have a lot to apologize for, it was mostly a miscommunication and Cal and I had pretty much resolved it that very night.

When I then asked Em if she was angry at me, she snapped and said that me asking that was annoying, and that my reactions were toxic. While I said more than I should have, our relationship was one where it was normal for me to not have filters while talking to Em. 

We didn't talk for two days (where we used to talk every day), and when we did it turned into about a week long argument with breaks between for classes and work. During this argument, I apologized for the things I did wrong. Mostly, I was really loopy from my meds that night and therefore ended up saying things I wouldn't usually say. I definitely made some mistakes, but I did my best to own up to them. The one thing I stood firm on was that I needed an apology for her calling me toxic and annoying. She refused to apologize, since ""those described my behaviors, not me as a person."" But... my behaviors ARE part of me. She never apologized for saying that.

I did say I thought she was subconsciously trying to hurt me when she called me toxic and annoying. When I said that, she said it was very hurtful of me to say. When I apologized, she said ""It's still very hurtful that you said that to me, intention or not the words will be hard to recover from"" .... she called me toxic and annoying and never apologized for it? The same thing should be true for both parties?

During the follow up argument, she also said that she had issues with our relationship since APRIL ( it was October when we had the argument ) but never brought them up because she didn't think I could ""handle it."" I've always been extremely careful to talk through any issues as soon as I can (within a week to realizing them), and she seemed like she would do the same. She still hasn't told me what her full problem was.

We proceeded to not talk much for the next week or so, until in a group chat she decided to shit talk me. It was clearly meant for a DM with Cal. She deleted the text immediately, but I did see it. I confronted her on the group chat immediately, and said that it's not okay to shit talk me like that. She immediately blocked me on every platform, without saying another word to me.

I have three sisters, we are all married, and combined they have six kids total. I don't have kids. I live in Colorado, but my sisters and parents all live on the east side of the country. Because of their travel costs, we have to make sure wherever we choose is within driving distance for all of them, which would make it flying distance for my husband and me.

My sisters want to split the costs evenly for the lake house, even though their kids and will be taking up more bedrooms than my husband and I. I explained that this is unfair because we don't have kids, and we should split it by room each family will be using.

They tried to guilt me into splitting the costs evenly by saying it's more expensive to travel with children, and we all want the kids there, so we should \*all\* (me and my husband) be willing to help the parents out. But my husband and I have to fly AND rent a car, so our costs add up too.

So I said I will not be splitting it evenly, and will pay for the one bedroom my husband and I are taking up. Now this is causing a lot of drama in the family.

EDIT: To answer a few questions - this idea was first my mom's, but my sisters and I are all very excited about it. If my husband and I stayed somewhere else nearby, it would be taken as an insult to the family and would cause more drama. My parents aren't paying for this because they are not financially able to do so. My sisters and I are all very capable of paying for the vacation - none of us are hard on cash. 

UPDATE: My husband and I talked about it, and we are willing to split a house evenly between the four sisters if the house is $700 or less per family. I found a great option that fits that description, albeit a bit smaller than the house this post was originally written about. Outside of the $700, we will not be splitting evenly and will only pay for the room we occupy. I plan to tell my sisters tomorrow.

I grew up with my parents until yhey divorced when I was 10. I'm not in touch with my mom. My dad got my custody, he barely paid attention to me as a kid due to work but since he was rich, he bought things for my entertainment. He pays for me, and I don't butt into this business and stay in my own. We converse 1 to 2 times per week. Easy. Now, he's married a woman who he's dated for 4 months.

Now, I also don't really care about friendships. I lie a lot to make people feel nice and welcome. I do prefer my own company. But I'll pretend to be an extrovert so I can still get involved in things and find fun in the chaos and drama that is people. I secretly cause chaos but people don't know that it's me. I don't take it far, only basic useless drama.

After he married her, he has been watching me like a hawk for a couple of months. He rarely cared about talking to me before marriage. But weirdly, this time he has been forcing me to talk and spend time with him and his wife. He will hug me more which makes me feel uncomfortable since I don't enjoy touch. His wife was trying to fake her happiness at spending time with me. It's not hard to see through people.

Today, he sat me down. He told me I needed help. That i was manipulative and unemotional. He observed. He looked at my friends. He looked at how I instigated everything online without me knowing. He went thru my phone. He told me he doesn't understand why I'm not a talkative person, why I don't express anything (because i don't care??). 

So I told him that we can just do smthn else, trying to stop him from poking into this useless stuff. He started an argument about my emotional state, my friends, and made me internally angrier until i finally gave up with my harmonic front and left to go to my room. I told him he should focus on other things because there's nothing wrong, and that me lying to friends is none of his business and that me not being talkative shouldn't be the end of the world. Plus why does he care about this now? This isn't going to benefit him at all.

Even though she has me and so many other people who have constantly told her that if she needed any help, she can always call us and we’ll lend a supporting hand to her.

However, our friend recently contacted us again after not responding back to us in a month, and began to apologize and explain why she seemed like she ghosted us for a whole month.

And then she explained that the reason was because she broke up with her boyfriend due to a major verbal disagreement that led him to get the police to kick her out of their shared apartment about a month ago. And that she was literally out in the streets until she finally found a homeless shelter to stay at. And that she was stable enough now to finally contact us again after going missing for so long.

After her explanation, I asked her why she didn’t ask us to help her when this first happened. 

And our friend simply mentioned that she wasn’t thinking about us, and that she was too busy dealing with this unfortunate situation **on her own** to even think about contacting us for help.

And when I asked her if she wanted to stay at my place right now, since I was worried about her safety due to her staying at a homeless shelter not being the safest place to stay at.

I (24F) live with my brother (30M) and one male cousin who is the same age. Our other cousin, (34F) has two kids (10F and 5M) and lost her fiancé two years ago. I offered to help watch the kids and help her out. She was normal about it until a few months ago when I lost my job, and started doing commission work and eventually started a YouTube channel. I guess she figured I had all the time in the world for her kids, because she started dropping them off at my place *every weekend* to sleep over without even asking, and then picking them up way late into the next day, just so she can go party or see her sugar daddy.

She openly admitted, “sometimes I just drop them so whoever’s home can watch them,” and I cussed her out. She apologized, but didn’t make much effort to change. My roommate/cousin agrees to babysit but then hides in his room or even leaves, so at times I’d end up having to deal with the kids. One time, he even *left them alone* at our place, and when I came home with my brother we were confused at them being there. Then the other cousin started texting me to check on them and asked my brother and I (since I didn’t have my license at the time) to go pick their food up for them—like we were the ones that agreed to watch them in the first place. If I were a worse person, I’d have called CPS on them.

Since there’s not much I can do about him bringing the kids here, I’ve started either locking myself in my room with a mini fridge or planning to be out, usually the latter.

My wife had a pretty good, middle class childhood, no major issues other than the typical stuff you experience as you grow up. Her parents were loving and did the best they could for her and her brother. There are no buried secrets or hidden abuses, I don't believe either my wife or her brother ever even got spanked.

Her parents have always been there for us and on more than a few occasions have helped us financially when we needed it. Honestly they are a somewhat boring Hallmark channel family and I cherish it.

My wife is really terrible about being in contact with her family, but especially her parents. She just... doesn't make an effort. I will often ask her if she has spoken to anyone and she just says ""I will later"" and then never does. Sometimes weeks go by and she won't reach out to them at all.

I told my girlfriend about how he’s sick today and she said “think it’s time to put him down”. This made me quite upset and I didn’t really say much as it was over text. 

Would/am I the asshole if I tell her that her comment was rude and insensitive? 
The vet said he’s isn’t suffering and I’m thinking he just had a stomach bug atm (she knows all of this). 

Feeling pretty upset so I’m not texting her back atm as I don’t want to be immature or say something rude if I’m overreacting due to my emotions around my best buddy getting put down in a year or two.. 

TLDR: upset about a comment that my girlfriend made about my dog, wondering if saying something would make me the asshole?

Update/edit: took him to an emergency vet, they said he’s fine but likely sick with something but it should pass. Everything else looks fine plus I filled them in on his current health issues and apparently nothing alarming is popping up.

Secondly, a lot of people are accusing me of holding onto him. I am not, I have put a pet down before and I have 3 dogs atm. I just genuinely didn’t think this was something that would warrant considering putting him down as I figured he was just sick which he is.

Thanks for all the comments so far and I hope some people are relived to hear he’s ok right now! I sure am. 

FINAL update: after a lot of comments and quite a few saying I’m being immature, acting like a victim, etc… I’ve decided tomorrow (she’s working tonight) that I’ll tell her I’m sorry for overreacting and was just stressed with the situation, and that she couldn’t have known it was a stomach bug and not an actual issue! 

I really didn’t wanna be rude towards her but a few people have pointed out that I’ve got a lot of maturing to do, which I suppose is true. It’s my first time navigating this sort of issue so I just wanted advice and I thank everyone who helped. I’m sorry if I can across as immature or like I was acting like a victim, I truly didn’t have bad intentions at the time. 

Thanks again :)

119,1gcw1ph,AITA For Stopping My Manager From Stealing My Charger?,"AITA for stopping my manager from stealing my charger? My (M, 25) manager Mike (M, 45) is in the office down the hall from me. He always seemed like a pretty nice guy and he'd stop by my office just to chat at least once a day. We had a good relationship.

It all started when, a couple months ago, he stopped in my office to ask if I had a phone charger, because he'd left it at home by accident. I said ""sure, I always keep one plugged in by my desk,"" and I handed it to him. He thanked me, used it, and gave it back the next morning because he'd forgotten to return it. No worries.

Since then, he'd ask to borrow my charger a couple times a week. I'd say sure and hand it to him. Lending it didn't bother me, but he would always forget to give it back. So I'd always have to walk down the hall to his office and ask for it back if I needed it. Not a big deal, but a little annoying.

Then, about a month ago, I went on vacation for a couple days. When I came back into the office that morning, you guessed it, my charger was gone. The thing is, I lock my office every time I leave. And the only other person with a key is...you guessed it...my manager. Mike.

Lo and behold, I walk into Mike's office to check in, and my charger is there. Plugged into the wall. Charging his phone. He sees me looking at it and just says “Hope you don’t mind I borrowed it while you were gone,” and tosses it back to me.

Since then, it’s become a pretty common thing for him to just walk into my office -locked or no- and grab it without asking. This was starting to get on my nerves so I went on Amazon and found this thing called a LockSocket, which locks your charger in place so it can’t be moved or taken. I got it the next day and it only took me a minute to install it on the outlet in my office.

Since then, my charger is always right where I need it, but some of my coworkers think I overreacted and should just buy another charger. So, AITA?

But, about a month ago, I finally had the opportunity to buy a new car. Beforehand, I had a 1999 Ford Fiesta; it was my first car, and I barely spent any money on gas.   
I don't have many financial responsibilities, so I chose to enjoy being a young man with a decent salary and bought a supercar. I LOVE my new car, and so do my coworkers, which means a lot more requests started coming my way for lifts home.   
I've worked at my current job for about 6 months, and I've probably done over 100 detours to make my coworkers happy.   
Here's the problem; not ONCE have I been offered any form of compensation from any of them, even though they would've had to pay for public transport, if I didn't offer them a lift.   
Now, my new car is quite a bit more expensive than my old one, which means it does not drive that far km/l (approx 12-13 km/l). 

Apparently, this is completely otherworldly for my coworkers. Today, I said no for the first time. I got asked if I could give them a lift, and I said: (sure, if you pay me the fee you would have to for public transport, I'll drive you home), and this did not sit well with them.

Beth saw the story and texted me about it, asking me why I quit, askes about the new company and the new job, and instead of congratulate me she told me I wasn't a good friend.

122,1gcunek,WIBTA if I told my coworker I won't give him rides anymore?,"Throwaway just in case they are on Reddit.

I have a coworker that works similar shifts as me at the factory I work at. We live about 2 miles apart and recently his car broke down.  He asked for a ride for the ""next week or two"" until they got it fixed. I said of course and not to worry about gas money since it's not that much extra for me and they have a car to fix.

It has now been 6 weeks (Tuesday  starts week 7) and the car still isn't fixed. There have been a list of reasons, mostly money issues.  I understand he's poor and has a few kids at home. We make the same so I know money has to be tight. 

The first week they asked about carpooling even after their car was fixed. I said no, I like my time alone in the car before and after work. Also it does change my pre-work routine and cuts down on time with my girlfriend(about an hour total a week).  They just kept talking about how I should think about it and it will benefit us both. 

In the last 6 weeks lots of annoyances have popped up. His coffee thermos leaks. It rolls around on my floor leaving drops of coffee. My car now smells like it and I hate coffee. I asked he put it in a bag, he does about half the time without me reminding/bringing a bag. Since our breaks are the same he sits in my car, I like being alone on break, this has ruined my breaktime. He has also left early multiple times because he's sore and the(unpaid) time off is offered. He sits in my car for hours while I work, drinking/spilling coffee, then says he doesn't have money to fix his car. He also hasn't offered gas money again and it feels rude to ask when I told them not to worry about it initially. 

This is where I feel like an asshole.  I want to tell them after this coming week I won't give them a ride anymore.  There is no real reason I can't, I just don't want to. I want my normal pre-work routine back, and to be left alone on break. I know they are going to ask for another week after that because rent will be due.  I honestly want to say no, point to the times they left work early, and tell them too bad.  That tactic seems rude but I feel like the one more week will turn into a month like now. 

So would I be the asshole if I say no more rides after this week, and hold them to it?

Edit: I got all of my good qualities from my mom. One of those is being so willing to help others when you can. Like I said in the post, technically, I still CAN help. Thanks for making me feel like it's okay to put a limit to my kindness. I told him yesterday that this week is the last week I can help.  He says his car will be done Friday. Hopefully it is and we can move past this.

I was also dealing with some pretty heavy depression at the time and feeling worthless. We did eventually get more friends, and so I went back to being quieter, not that I particularly minded. As long as I felt like I had friends, I didn't need to talk. That being said, she started doing more stuff with just them, so I sometimes felt left in the dust, although as long as I could stand by them I felt fine.

For a few months, that was our system. I'd be pretty quiet with our other friends, we'd talk about music or something, I'd give her the answers for homework or give her revision notes, and we'd each rant to each other about whatever shit was going on in our lives (usually our parents). I was happy with this, and I thought she was, too.

Eventually, she suddenly stopped talking to me. It wasn't a gradual thing, she stopped sitting by me for lunch and in classes avoided talking to me as much as possible (I wouldn't really ever initiate conversation myself, I kind of have a 'speak only if spoken to' thing that I can't stop.) So, since I'm terrible at confrontation, and I don't know whether I'm reading this correctly, for all I know people just do this, I write her a note. I wanted to tell her how I was feeling and give myself time to get my thoughts down properly. I gave it to her, she basically said I was really moody at that point and she didn't want to deal with me. I said that's fine, I'll try and do better, if it happens again let me know.

\~Two weeks pass, and she stops talking to me again. I wait until after Christmas to see whether she'll be fine after, since maybe something else is going on. Nothing changes, and I write her another note. She tells me she won't read it, since writing a note is petty. I, annoyed because I spent hours writing the note, read it to her aloud. She basically says I've been doing nothing but complaining, that she's not my mother, etc. I agree, before the two weeks, I was definitely going through it more then, and while I actively didn't want to talk about specifics, I was definitely more mopey.

It's been the best part of 2 years now, and I still don't know if she's in the wrong here. Her friends still interact with me, and don't show any animosity, but from what I can tell are still friends with her too.

126,1gcu56c,AITA for being stern with my roommates child? ,"

I've been friends with my roommate for 7 years now. She's a single mom to a six-year-old son and we decided to move in together a year ago. It didn't take long for me to notice that her son doesn't really listen to her and often does the opposite of what he’s told. This behavior started happening with me too. I've been beyond patient all this time, but last week I decided to be a bit firmer with him. I wasn't yelling, just trying to be clear. Every time I ask him not to do something, he keeps doing it until l've asked multiple times. My roommate sees this happen every day but never says anything to her son. She just watches me ask repeatedly without stepping in. 
Here are some examples of what I’m talking about (this all happened yesterday by the way):

I was making cake pops for a party, he kept coming up and sticking his fingers in the sprinkles. I politely asked him not to. He continued to do it 2 more times before he stopped. 

I went over to the blinds and opened them. When I walked away, he immediately ran over to the blinds and while making eye contact with me, started to close them. This annoyed me because in my opinion it was him trying to get a reaction out of me. I said to him “leave the blinds open.”

I was making a balloon arch for the party. He walked in the room and knowing he was going to start playing with all the balloons, I kindly said to him “these are for our party tomorrow, if you’d like to play with a balloon please play with the one upstairs. I just don’t want these to pop.” He then immediately walked up to the balloons and started kicking them. So I said “I already asked you not to touch them, don’t do it again”

*Please keep in mind that I DID NOT raise my voice. I simply stated it in a more stern tone.*

My roommate completely flipped out on me, saying it's not my place to correct her child since I'm not his mother and I don't get to use a stern tone with him. I tried to explain that there's only so much patience a person can have and that I thought it was fair to be firm after asking nicely several times. This led to a huge argument, and she told me to “google it"" because it supposedly says it's never okay to correct someone else's kid. Am I in the wrong? She keeps saying, ""he's only six,"" but I think that's not a valid excuse; kids should learn respect. Plus, she had this whole conversation in front of her son when I told her this was not a conversation to be had in front of him. She then got mad at me for “hurting her son’s feelings”. 
I personally feel as if I am being asked to have 0 boundaries when it comes to her son. I asked her what the solution is, she said to come to her every time. The problem is that every time this happens, she sits there and watches it. I feel as if me saying “Do something about this” is me telling her how to parent, which she made clear I’m not allowed to do. So what I gathered is that I’m not allowed to tell her how to handle her son, but I also am not allowed to be strict with him either.

We do all three even tho our class is mostly about acting, i love being in this school, the only problem is my modern dance teacher (30M), he constantly abuses verbally many students if something doesnt go his way and even if his mood isnt the best, i find that really unprofessional and overall wrong, most of us never did any type of dance before this school except like two classmates who did ballet before, yet since the first year he screams at us if we do something wrong or we dont know something, even going to the length of calling some of us dumbasses and telling some students that they will never do anything in their life and that they are just useless. In these years ive seen many of my friends leave the school from all the abuse received, a female friend of mine even got shamed for her depression by him telling all the class that she takes antidepressants, so then i reported this to some of our teachers and we decided to talk about it in class, there i thiught all my classmates wouldve agreed with me. Well lets just say that i couldve never expected the response that i received, even tho some agreed with me i was attacked by many others telling me that he is a good teacher and the verbal abuse is to get us used to how acting is out of the school and that im way too optimist to think that i cant change that, they also told me that im not Lady Gaga nor Beyoncé and i cant pretend to be treated nicely cause im no one.

I thought he was kinda cute at first, but later found out he has a girlfriend so I dropped it. I also found out he was in a band and I started following them and listened to their music because it’s a genre I happen to like. We don’t work together anymore so I don’t see him, but my friend and I talk about him occasionally since she meets him quite frequently at her boyfriend’s house. She knows I thought he was cute, so we would jokingly talk about bf what it would be like if we were a thing.

Just recently my friend and her boyfriend had a fight (because he’s a walking red flag which she chooses to ignore) and I was there to witness it. I told her that she needs to stop forgiving him instantly, that I didn’t like him at all and she could tell him that if she wanted to. Right after this happened I was on the buss home and got a message from him through her saying it made BOTH of them uncomfortable when I followed his brothers band on social media and I “HAD to stop because he has a girlfriend and we worked together for one summer, that’s it” they made me sound like a total stalker. I don’t know my friends boyfriend so the only way he could know any of this information would be if she told him these things. And the fact that she ever insinuated that I’m a home wrecker pisses me the fuck off because she knows I’m not. My theory is that he’s trying to get rid of me since I see how conniving he really is.

I apologized to them of course like a total doormat and unfollowed the band everywhere because I was so tired and shocked by the sudden message. But now I’m wondering what I REALLY did wrong?

129,1gctgtx,AITA for not shortening my holiday to use more vacation days for my sister‘s graduation?,"I (28F) have a sister (24F) who will be graduating next April with her bachelor’s degree. For context, she and I live in different countries. While she’s still studying, I just recently found a new job after a long period of unemployment. This unemployed forced me to cancel a holiday I had planned with my long time partner (we live together) for this past May.

Now that I’m employed, I can finally start planning that holiday again for next year. Meanwhile, my sister will be graduating in April, and told her my I’d love to fly over to celebrate with her. However, she told me she’ll only know the exact date of her graduation about a week beforehand. This is a problem for me, as I need to request time off in advance to secure holidays. Additionally, it’s close to Easter, so flights will be hard to find and likely very expensive if I don’t book enough in advance. Despite all that, I planned and reassured her, that I would do my best to take two days off and come for her graduation ceremony. 

At my job, I get 26 days of holiday per year. I plan to use 17 days for my holiday with my partner and thought of splitting the remaining days between my sister’s graduation and visiting family for Christmas.

When I expressed these concerns, my sister got really upset, calling me a selfish bitch for not prioritizing her over my holiday. She argued that, since I know the general timeframe, I should have already requested time off accordingly. However, doing so would mean taking more than a week off, as I’d need to cover the graduation range (April 9–15), plus travel time and extra days just in case (in case her graduation is on the 14th or 15th, I’d need to stay until at least Friday 19th for any celebrations).

According to her, I should take April 8–20 off to be safe, which would require using eight working days. I explained that this would leave me with no days to visit for Christmas. She yelled at me, insisting that I should have planned a shorter holiday with my partner to ensure I could be there for her graduation. My parents are siding with her, saying that I’m making her feel unimportant and that family should come first. No matter how much I try to explain, they just tell me I’m being selfish.

At first she couldnt do much so shed cry alot feeling helpless & unworthy. When she started working again she met someone. She says she isnt interested but she clearly is. 

Anyways she has been messing around with this person who she constantly decides she will ""never interact with again"" & then does. 
Everytime she seems happy she comes to the realization that she shouldnt be talking to this person & is really conflicted about everything.. She spends alot of her free time with person tho so it confused me when she said she had been physical with this person & wished circumstances were diffrent so she didnt have to. She was crying to me about how she had to give up so much of herself all her life & that she had no other choice cuz she relies on person for x-y-z.. it irritated me because she has no reason to feel that way NOW. 

A. She still has access to my home. She can come & go & she does. 

B) She makes good money & doesnt mind over spending on certain things 

C) Shes usually the one to initiate contact with this person. 

D) she buys things for this person, she will take an uber to her without money concerns. 

She brought up how she doesnt have anything or anyone, that she deals with people only because circumstances I told her its okay to feel some type of way or to regret her decisions but they are still her decisions. Its not fair for her to say she didnt want to interact with person while person has no clue she feels that way & she only felt that way afterwards. The way she puts it it sounds like R which she already said wasnt it.

She got so angry. Said she did it cuz shes practically homeless & needs somewhere to stay. I asked what she meant & she clarified she meant like a bed that the couch wasnt as comfortable & i said okay but it was a choice to not want to be as comfortable. Also she could get a room she has money. She cut me off saying person was the only feasable choice right now. A room would be a waste of money & she was attempting to save up. again i told her she was choosing to value the money more than not wanting to ""give herself up"". 
We went back & forth about it & she acted like acknowledging that was an attack to her & was in huge denial. Im just worried about if this conversation was too harsh for her mental state. She seems emotional & maybe it wasnt the time to tell her that?

When my gf couldn't make a decision, her mom left to go to the market out of anger. I told my gf that she should probably quickly decide which one to keep and which one to throw away, and then go after her to apologize.

Half an hour later, she's still texting me about how she still doesn't know which one to throw away. She's starting to plan selling it second-hand or giving it to me so it doesn't get discarded. Enough time has passed that her mom comes back home and she's still angry (fair). And she's even madder that my gf didn't go and apologize. (She told me today that her mom said, ""Anyone who can think straight will go to the market with me."")

She next messaged me that, ""I apologized and said why I couldn't be there,"" but now she's telling me this is a lesson not to follow my advice in cases like this. After this, she had to turn her phone in. She just texted me with the quote from earlier and that ""this IS a death strike."" I asked her why, saying that the advice wasn't that bad. (Remember, if she'd just done what I said and quickly thrown something away, then gone to the market, it would have been exactly what her mom wanted.)

She reasons that, although the advice itself wasn't bad, the consequences were. She also said she didn't give me all the details. Only then did she give the quote from the beginning (she says she was well aware of what would happen if she didn't go).

So, a couple of days ago, my gf (18F) told me (16M) that her mom was forcing her to throw away one of two old jackets and that her mom was frustrated because she seemed ungrateful to get a new one. When my gf couldn't make a decision, her mom left to go to the market out of anger.

132,1gct7sc,AITA for wanting half of the room me and my brother share,"I've always had about 30% of the room me and my brother share. My parents put up a shelf divider that you can put bins in. So we can't see each other and have more privacy. It's been like this for the past 5 years. About a year and a half ago I asked them to talk down the shelf divider, or at least move it more on my brother's side. My mom would tell me that l'd get a bigger room when we moved and my dad would always say he would move it the next day. None of that ever happened. Since I have such little of the room my side is messy plus I have way more stuff than my brother. I would try to clean up and throw some stuff away but it would just get messy again. I don't think it fair that I should have to throw my stuff away when they can simply move the shelf divider. So today I moved it only a bit. I want to say that now I have like 40% of the room. Even though that's still not half I think it's fair enough and I get a bit more space that will really help me. Also, I'm 16 and my brother is 22. I called my mom to tell her I moved it and the first thing she said was ""Well is there going to be room for him to move his gaming chair?"" I straight up and told her I didn't care about that and that when he got home from work she better back me up. Then I called my dad and he 100% agreed with what I did. Plus my brother hasn't shipped in for rent and he has a job. He hasn't gotten home yet but I know he's going to be pissed but I don't really care.

133,1gcsx0f,AITA for not attending my own birthday party,"I 22(M) had my 22 second birthday last Wednesday. For reference me and my parents have never gotten along, I don’t expect perfection from anyone and never have but they definitely could’ve gotten to know me better. For years I have begged to not have a birthday party as I don’t drink and these parties are usually an excuse for my family to get drunk and disorderly, every year I am told that I need to have a family party or I will be kicked out from my house (in which I have a lease and pay rent to my father). This year I explicitly said that I will not be having a birthday party and just wanted some peace and quiet after a long day of work. As I arrived home I noticed 20+ cars belonging to family, friends and neighbors parked at my house. I called my mother and asked what was happening and was told that I needed to have a party “for the family”. I promptly hung up and drove off. My mother kicked me out and I’ve been crashing on my cousins couch. 


*edited for clarity, could’ve spent a couple more minutes on this lol, my mother kicked me out not my father, I’ve been in contact with my father consistently since about returning and setting up some boundaries. 
I want to say to all who read this that my father is the greatest man I’ve met but unfortunately he continued the cycle. 
My dad has a terrible relationship with his own mother and ended up marrying my mother who is incredibly similar in opinion, presence and demand. My mother is an incredible force (not a compliment) who has terrified me, my siblings and my father for our entire lives. Our entire lives have revolved around making her happy, if she’s not happy neither are we etc etc. 
My father took my side in this whole ordeal as he has before, he has been sleeping on the couch since. That’s the dynamic between my 6’4 father and 5’3 mother. As you can probably infer, due to the height difference many assume the emotional abuse would be the opposite but my dad is the sweetest and most kindest father, who somehow took the time to teach me everything I needed to know to survive and become an adult. I am truly lucky for him but I guess that makes me equally unlucky for my mother. I will be moving back in but luckily as I’ve been working full time in law enforcement for about a year I’m pretty close to being at a point where I can move out and feasibly rent and save for a home. I’m pretty tough I think I can last a few more months (hopefully lol)

134,1gcstdl,AITA for telling my roommate to pay for her own food after she ate my meal prep?,"So, I'm a 24F studying economics and I've been living with my roommate Luna for about six months now. I've got this whole meal prep thing going on to save money and time, right? Well, last Sunday, I made these amazing chicken teriyaki bowls that were supposed to last me the week.   
But here's the drama: I come home to find out Luna has already eaten most of my meals. I was pretty upset, like, I spent hours on that. So, I told her she needs to start buying her own food or we should split the cost of groceries from now on.   
Luna got all defensive, saying she was hungry and thought it was okay since we're roommates. Now she's not talking to me, and I'm left wondering if I was too strict. Should I have just shared? Is AITA for setting boundaries about food?  
TL;DR: Roommate ate my week's worth of meals.
