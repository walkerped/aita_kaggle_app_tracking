Felix and I sat down and had a conversation about how to manage his mother going forwards. I told him everything that she had said to me and he was adequately furious with her. He asked me exactly what I wanted done in the future so that she'd understand where our boundaries are. And follow them. I told him that I'd rather him speak to her alone at first so that I wasn't immediately made out to be the bad guy.

I acted on advice and locksmith has been called to change the locks on the house, and Felix has ordered us a Ring doorbell off Amazon with the assurance 'I'll be able to put it in' (he hates doing the electrics but you know how it is I'll leave him to it lol). And then he called up MIL and organised a lunch date for today so they could have a talk between themselves. He got back in the afternoon and as he walked into the door, smiled at me and went ""Sorted!"" and, characteristically, went to go and make himself a cup of tea.

I got a message a few minutes later from her saying she was very sorry for what she had said to me, that she was in the wrong. Only going to visit when invited, not going to go into the nursery anymore, and was going to respect the rules and boundaries that he and I set for our home life and for our child. And after added that she was sorry for the comments she'd made on my appearance. I'll believe it when I see it but at least it's a good start, and we've all agreed to go for dinner at some point to talk about future expectations when the the baby comes.

I talked to Felix, and he said that she'd been offended at first, didn't believe she'd done anything wrong, and he also specifically said she hit with the spiel of ""Oh I must be such an awful mother then"", and he told me he'd told her ""It's not about that, it's about you disrespecting my wife, our child and our home. If you continue, you're not going to dream of being able to see your grandchild."". She was apparently and unsurprisingly sulky, and he told her to apologise, and she said she would and to her credit did.

Thank you all for your advice about how to handle thing going forwards with the locks and everything. The amount of support was crazy but I can't thank you all enough, I feel so much calmer about the situation. I don't know if she's going to stick to what she said going forwards, but at least boundaries have been set and I know that Felix has my back. 

On a lighter note to end, I asked if he had anything he wanted to say to the people who had commented, and he said, ""Can you add that photo of me in Florida?"" (Felix...That's not even slightly relevant.) ""Shame. What do you want for tea?""

4,1gdio14,AITA for not returning a cat to prior owners who surrendered the cat to us 2-days earlier?,"On Wednesday, my boyfriend (we‚Äôll call him B) was contacted by one of his coworkers (Anna) about a cat that needed a new home. According to Anna, her friend Darla was planning on moving far away and was looking for a good home for her kitty. At the time there were no details other than that Darla was going to move long-distance and it would be too hard for them to move the cat, so we put together a list of typical adoption questions (i.e. Medical conditions, why are you giving kitty up, etc) and had Anna get the answers for us. Anna comes back to B with answers and everything seems all clear, so we agree to take the cat in.

On Friday, Anna asks B if we can pick up the cat and we agree to meet her to handoff the cat in a mutual location- Darla told Anna to give us everything to go with the kitty, including a huge cat tree, toys, food, litter - the works. We pick up the kitty from Anna on Friday, and she tells us that Darla mentioned to her that if they didn‚Äôt find a good home for the kitty, they were planning to put the cat down. (Note: The cat is only 2 years old) We take the cat and get her situated at home‚Ä¶ Darla tells Anna that she will miss the cat dearly, and Anna promises her on our behalf that we will send pictures afterwards to prove she‚Äôs doing well in her new home.

Two days later (today) we get a frantic text from Anna saying that Darla is losing it and cannot live without her cat, and that she wants her back. B and I are unsure if Darla ever meant to give up the cat (as Anna was the middle man, we never spoke to Darla directly) and asked to call Anna to hear her side of the story. Over the phone, Anna details how Darla was perfectly happy to give the kitty away until Saturday night when she started to blow up Anna‚Äôs phone. She knows that Darla has also potentially mistreated other cats based on stories Darla told Anna, so she wanted to make sure kitty had a safe home before Darla put the cat down. After the call, Anna also sends us screenshots of her texts with Darla that make it very clear that it wasn‚Äôt a cat-napping, and that Darla is maybe just having regrets. Anna gave us Darla‚Äôs number and told us to call her if we want to settle it with her that way, but she told Darla that she lost B‚Äôs number and won‚Äôt be able to get it again until Wednesday. Anna‚Äôs embarrassed that Darla would even put her in a position like this to essentially try to reclaim a cat that was surrendered.

B and I have concerns that returning the cat will result in her being put down, and she‚Äôs a perfectly sweet kitty! We also don‚Äôt want to call Darla, as we think our anonymity to her is safer for us- and ultimately, we don‚Äôt want to put the cat through even more stress as the kitty is just starting to come out of her shell here.

Most are beaten to hell and there's no guarantee you're getting stuff that fits properly. Last year, the set the team had were far too big for my kids spindly legs.

However a few days ago one of my friends asked if we wanted to go to a Halloween themed nightclub. The other friend would already be going with his girlfriend so he wanted to. I, however really DO NOT want to go. I'm an introvert and has suffered with social anxiety my whole life which they're very aware of. Ive also given night clubs and partked a chance and I absolutely despise it, I count down the hours until it would be appropriate for me to go home. 

I told them that I didn't want to go to the nightclub and I could tell one of my friends was really disappointed. She said that I had to learn to go to nightclubs and that I would get FOMO if I didn't go. I don't get FOMO, never have. And I also got really annoyed by the fact that she said I had to learn to party. I don't think I need to learn at all. I'd rather stay home and play some videogames. 

I told her that I'd love meet her and my other friend but I did not want to go to the nightclub. She hasn't responded and it's been two days. Now I just feel guilty and maybe like I should suck it up and go but I also really really really don't want to. 

I should also add that I've been studying none stop the last three weeks, barely gotten any sleep and my last exam is the day before we would go to the nightclub.

She's always been introverted and kinda stayed in her own bubble. She likes her space and she stays in it. She's been at college for about a semester now and she's come home almost every weekend, I've always just assumed she preferred being at home.

To add context, i suffer with severe anxiety, autism and hypermobile spectrum disorder. all of these affect my daily life.

We got to this hangout and i immediately felt like people didn‚Äôt really want me there. nonetheless i stayed quiet and kind of just followed along with everyone.
People were acting a little weird around me but i just pinned it to my anxiety.

After a little while, we decided to go and get bubble tea at a local store, and i went ahead to get a moment to myself. In this time i texted my other friend that was not at the celebration about my emotions and how my anxiety was acting up. 

After a little while, everyone left the store and i was still waiting on my order. while i waited i posted a photo on my snapchat story talking about my anxiety and how i was kind of struggling.
I left the store thinking nothing of it and we continued 

Afterwards, we went to a fast food place so my friends could use the bathroom and i ordered some food.
It took a while, and afterwards a member of the group came up to me and asked how long i was gonna be. i said i didn‚Äôt know and was told that if i wasn‚Äôt done in 5 minutes i was going to be left behind.

I told the person i was able to catch up with them anyways if they left and admitted i didn‚Äôt exactly want to be there at the moment. when they asked why, i explained about my anxiety surrounding the feeling that people didn‚Äôt want me there.

I was asked ‚Äúso you feel like i don‚Äôt want you here?‚Äù 
I said yes and the person nodded and walked off. They all left without telling me and about 10 minutes later i had a bunch of dms telling me that i was an asshole and i shouldn‚Äôt have said that

i was also being told that i shouldn‚Äôt have needed to take so many breaks and was slowing everyone down and that i was overreacting about my disability.
(Throughout the day i had also mentioned how i was in a lot of pain walking and felt like i was going to collapse)

After all of this, i texted the groupchat i‚Äôm in with all the people at this meet up, telling them i was going to go home and i‚Äôm sorry i couldn‚Äôt stay longer. They all got upset at me and accused me of trying to make my friends birthday about myself, and called me selfish.

My dad has been out of my life for almost as many years. But even before my mom and ""Ted"" got married he wasn't a big part of my life. You see, my dad is mentally ill. There's a family history of it on his side of my family. He's got it bad and isn't capable of being a good dad or really a reliable person. Last I remember of him he couldn't really take care of himself. BUT and this is a big thing, I still love him and I have some good memories of him. 

Ted as a stepfather, I call him my mom's husband, is deserves of better or not good depending on your view overall. He provides for me, calls me his daughter, tries to spend time with me, offered to adopt me and provide for me well into the future. I said no to the adoption and didn't really let the incentive of being provided for long term sway me. My reason for this is due to how often he talks shit about my dad. My mom lets him so I have issues with her too. But the focus of my post is more about Ted and his extended family.

Ted is always so fast to remind me that my dad chose illness over me. That he has never paid child support and has a lot of child support debt to his name. He discouraged me looking at photos of my dad or his side of the family and would tell me he was a better choice for dad and his family were a way better family. Ted's family also repeat this to me a lot. I get reminded every time I see them that Ted stuck around, Ted stepped up, Ted isn't some ""crazy waste of life"" which is what they call my dad.

Last year it was clear I had inherited the mental illness gene. My mental illness is OCD. I got really bad because of it. A part of me always knew I was different. I had strict rules for stuff most people didn't think twice about. Like making my bed, writing, bathing/showering. I also freaked out a lot if I couldn't make things fit okay in my school binder or books/video games on my shelf.  My mom and Ted saw it too but mom didn't want to believe I could be ill and Ted believed his influence could prevent it. A crisis at the start of the year proved it all wrong and I got diagnosed. I spent some time doing inpatient because of how bad it got. When I got home and Ted was alone with me or me and my half siblings, I'd hear his family talk about me in ways that made me so uncomfortable. They said rejecting him made me sick because it pushed me more toward dad than Ted.

Ted's parents wanted to have a big family dinner yesterday and I was told repeatedly they wanted me there. By them directly and Ted and my mom. I chose not to go and I said I could not get off my planner right now. Which is true. But I just knew I couldn't be around them. My mom and Ted weren't happy and they said I had no trouble going off my planner to see my grandparents (mom's parents) or my three uncles and cousins.

15,1gdgp85,AITA for not weighing my potatoes at the grocery store?,"Sorry Redditors, no MILs, destination weddings with HS bullies, or step parents, just a boring trip to the grocery store. I (54F) just moved to a new city last month. The vibe here is a little different than my old city but it‚Äôs the same region of the country so not a drastic change. Last night I was hanging out with a friend (61M) who‚Äôs lived here a long time and it came up in conversation that we both needed to make a trip to the grocery store. We decided to go together. I only needed a few essentials but I saw they had some good looking fingerling potatoes, so I bagged some up and headed to meet him at the register. When he saw the potatoes, he told me I had to go back to the produce section, weigh them, and print out a tag. I said, No the cashier can just put the code in. Like every other grocery store I‚Äôve ever been to or worked at. He started getting visibly agitated and insisted the cashier was going to kick me out of line and make me go back to weigh them. I said It will be ok. And of course it was, she looked at the little book for maybe five seconds, put in the code, and that was that. Afterwards, he said I embarrassed him and upset the cashier by not doing it the correct way.

Sorry Redditors, no MILs, destination weddings with HS bullies, or step parents, just a boring trip to the grocery store. I (54F) just moved to a new city last month. The vibe here is a little different than my old city but it‚Äôs the same region of the country so not a drastic change. Last night I was hanging out with a friend (61M) who‚Äôs lived here a long time and it came up in conversation that we both needed to make a trip to the grocery store. We decided to go together. I only needed a few essentials but I saw they had some good looking fingerling potatoes, so I bagged some up and headed to meet him at the register. When he saw the potatoes, he told me I had to go back to the produce section, weigh them, and print out a tag. I said, No the cashier can just put the code in. Like every other grocery store I‚Äôve ever been to or worked at. He started getting visibly agitated and insisted the cashier was going to kick me out of line and make me go back to weigh them. I said It will be ok. And of course it was, she looked at the little book for maybe five seconds, put in the code, and that was that. Afterwards, he said I embarrassed him and upset the cashier by not doing it the correct way.

16,1gdgjct,"AITAH for making my mom get the covid vaccine which she claims has ""ruined her life""","throwaway acc for privacy. my mom has always been sick for as long as i remember. she has an autoimmune desease which affects mostly hear eyesight. she also has had multiple herniated discs (i think it's about 7 now) and had a hip replacement after having a staph infection from an injection into her joint.

her health has always been a topic in our family, naturally. she is a trooper because she managed to raise me and my siblings as a single mom while she had all these health issues, and i think we all turned out all right.

when covid hit, i was very worried. i was worried because it was the first big health crisis i had faced, but i was very worried for my family especially. i moved away for work about 10 years before the pandemic, i used to visit very frequently in the beginning, but it got less and less as the years went on. since my moms autoimmune disease caused her debilitating health issues, i was very worried about her especially. when the vaccine was first announced, i wanted her to get it asap.

she on the other hand was a sceptic about the whole covid thing. she was convinced that it is all overexagurated, and that we would all go back to normal in a bit, covid being nothing more than another flu variant.

i on the other hand desperately wanted her to be safe, take the vaccine, and hopefully never catch it (she caught it twice after the vaccine but only had mild symptoms thankfully). i spoiled it, but she ended up taking the vaccine. i talked to her on the phone one night and told her that i was scared that one day i would get the call that she is in the ICU, sick with covid, and i couldn't even visit her due to restrictions.

a few days later she called me and told me that my fears resonated with her and she was ready to take the vaccine. i was so happy, i was over the fucking moon. i felt like i did something good, something to protect my mom from harm.

fast forward to 2024. my moms health has deterioated more and more. her autoimmune disease is worse than ever, cortisone is not helping anymore. lately, my mom has been saying that her autoimmune disease getting worse is because she had the covid vaccine. she said her dentist confirmed that it is very likely tied to her getting the vaccine. i have no idea why her dentist is the authority on this claim, but he is a medical professional i guess.

anyways, her health has been worse than ever and she keeps bringing up the vaccine every time we talk about it. last thursday i finally cracked and told her that the likelihood of the vaccine making her illness worse is not scientifically proven at all, and that every time she says that ""the vaccine ruined her life"", it makes me feel like she is saying i ruined her life.

i don't know what to do anymore. she says ""i couldn't have known"", but every time she says it, all i hear is ""you ruined my life"". just for the record, her health was deterioating rapidly before the vaccine and i am no doctor or epidemiologist, but i don't think it's the vaccine that caused this. maybe in 10 years some study will come out that proves me wrong, and if that is the case, i will take full responsibility.

i have been keeping silent for years now every time she has brought it up, but i can't take hearing that a decision she made bc of me has ruined her life.

All over the toilet, the floor, the walls, the garbage, etc. It's a mess. 



She asked me to clean it - I said absolutely not. So she shut the door and is currently trying to sleep off the hangover on the couch - waking every hour or so to puke again. I've been looking after her and did a pharmacy run for electrolyte powders, pepto, etc., but I draw the line at cleaning up her puke again.

Boom, moment shut down, his boss was rejected in a way that's not mean and reminds him that my priority is my partner. He took it well, jumped up and followed to prepare our bed.

 Fianc√© went downstairs for a bit to have a chat. Then after about 10 minutes he went to bed and I went straight up behind him. As soon as I felt safe and was cuddled up to him in bed. I broke the news and told him exactly what happened. He was chill about it, way too chill. He was pissed at me this morning about it and told me that we needed to talk and he wasn't happy with me. Obviously, it hurt to hear, however he deserves to have his feelings. So we talked and he told me that he was sleeping on the spare bed for a while now since, we 'kissed'. I told him we didn't and he said ""well you both went to kiss each other."" I corrected him again. And he kept arguing, saying we both leaned in and I just would've kissed back anyway, and he knows I like his boss more and stuff that really hurt me. Then he said he was having a word with his boss. I asked him to wait until he was calmer since he really needed this job.

He said he'd think about not raising the issue so soon but as soon as I went home he rung me. He spoke to his boss. His boss' story was exactly the same as mine. HE went in for a kiss, I pulled away and he followed. Fianc√© said his boss is in the wrong, and understands that and he still has his job, but he's still pissed at me. Now it's for waiting too long to tell him. I apologised and then explained my reasoning once more and apologised again for hurting him.

Now, obviously, something shitty happened behind his back whilst he was out cold, he gets to feel however he needs to feel about that. What hurts though, is that in my opinion he doesn't need to have a reason to feel that way, he can just feel it and that's okay.

Of course, there is a reason for this because I have known her for a long time and know that she likes one-night stands. That's completely fine with me, I just don't want that to happen in my apartment and on my bed. That may be prudish, but that's the way it is.

Anyway, she's now upset and claims that she would never have done something like that anyway and that it was rude of me to suggest such a thing. She has now also found another place to sleep.

I think it was okay to talk about what I don't want in my apartment beforehand. She now interprets it as if I think badly of her.

27,1gddl7g,AITA for volunteering to help with my stepsisters for the wrong reasons?,"My dad got married 6 years ago. His wife's two daughters were 2 and 3 then. Their bio dad was out of the picture. My mom died 14 months before my dad got married (my parents had a ONS and weren't ever a couple).

So to clarify some things. I (16m) don't feel a bond with my stepsisters. I do sometimes spend time with them but that's more because they want it. I never *want* to hang out with them and I don't enjoy it. But I know my dad wants me to be a good ""brother"" to them. He encourages me to spend time with them as much as I can and he'll always call them my sisters and looks disappointed that I only say stepsisters.

But yeah, I don't really feel any closer to them now than I did 6 years ago. It's not that I dislike them either though. I know for them it's really different because they were so much younger and even if I had any doubt because of that, they call me their brother, like just their brother and each say they have a brother and a sister.

Sometimes my dad or his wife won't be able to do something for one or both girl (go to the park, walk to a friends house, take them to grab something at the store) and I volunteer for it because I always get paid for doing it. It's one of the ways everyone is happy. I'm spending more time with the girls which my dad and the girls like. I get something out of it which I like.

My dad only recently figured out that I don't do it out of love for the girls and a want to spend more time with them and he's disappointed in me now that I was volunteering for the wrong reasons. He said it's hurtful and it's going to really hurt them in a couple of years when they realize I don't reciprocate their love. He said it hurts him to know that 6 years of being siblings has meant nothing to me. He pointed out that they were so little when they became my ""sisters"" and he doesn't understand how I don't feel protective and caring for them by now.

Dad figured it out because he joined in on some of my therapy sessions (yes I have a therapist) and pieced stuff together based on what I was saying.

My dad keeps bringing it up to me and reminding me of how disappointed he is.

35,1gdbl2u,AITA for dancing with someone else at the club while I was with my boyfriend ? ,"
Here's the setup: there's me (F, 19), and my boyfriend (M, 21). We've been together for over a year, and right before our anniversary, we went to a club with my friend from college. I ended up drinking a bit too much. At one point, I was at the bar waiting for a drink, so I told them to go ahead to the dance floor without me. Once I got my drink, I couldn't find them, so I went up some stairs to get a better view of the whole dance floor. While I was scanning the crowd and texting that I was up on the stairs, some guy came over, and we started chatting. Then my boyfriend came up, saying he'd been looking for me for like 10 minutes and | told him l'd been looking for him too, but then I asked if I could dance with that guy. He said yes, so I went for it. Just to be clear-we didn't touch or flirt; literally nothing happened.
But afterward, my boyfriend and I argued because, to him, it felt like a kind of betrayal. He said it hurt him that while he was looking for me, I was talking to some random guy and then went to dance with him. It's been a week since then, and last night, he told me that because of what happened, he's starting to fall out of love with me.

36,1gdbdp2,AITAH for being cold to my sister's boyfriend?,"I (25F) met my sister's boyfriend for the first time when I visited my family a few weeks ago. My sister is 19 and has just started university, her boyfriend is 17 and still in high school and lives in our home town. They have been together for 6 months and this is my sister's first relationship. Contrary to everyone's expectations, she is very passionate about this boy, constantly posts pictures of the two of them on social media, and spends every minute of every day with him when she comes home from university. My family doesn't approve of him due to his unconventional style (he has a lot of piercings and tattoos), the fact that he smokes and that he is not an ""intellectual"" (their words not mine - I don't really know him yet) having rarely left our home town and his dream being opening his own tattoo and piercing shop. 

The plan was for us all to go out for pizza or drinks, just the four of us (my long-term partner was there as well), however I had a long day at that point and wanted to stay in, so I suggested we have dinner with the family and play cards after. When we got home that day, they were already there and introductions were had. I shook his hand and started at him blankly. My sister instantly asked why am I staring at him like that. Truth is, I was having difficulty processing the fact that she has a boyfriend - in my head, she is still my innocent 12-year-old little sister as I left the family home and moved to the UK for university at age 18. Me and her boyfriend didn't really hit it off, we just sat next to each other at dinner barely talking. Normally, when I first meet someone I bombard them with questions to get to know them, but I was finding it hard to talk to him at all. He didn't talk much to us either, an added difficulty was that he's not a confident English speaker and my boyfriend is British and doesn't speak our language.

When dinner has finished, I was ready to play cards in the hope that the atmosphere will brighten, but my sister's boyfriend mumbled something and they decided to go to him place instead. I was a bit taken aback by that as we barely got a chance to get to know him, and I texted my sister later on Snapchat to make her aware. She texted back saying her boyfriend felt unwelcome and that's why they left, to which I said communication is a two-way thing and when someone who's not family is invited for dinner, I'd expect that person to make some effort to get to know the members. Bearing in mind he's only 17, I told myself he's just a kid and I can't expect him to behave like an adult. We didn't meet him again until me and my partner left for the UK, so I feel like we left things unresolved and I don't know when we'll be next home as I only visit once or twice a year.

It also doesn't help that my sister and I are not that close, but considering everyone in the family has rejected this boy, I want to be her ally in this, but don't know how to handle the situation.

37,1gdas1s,AITA for telling my sister in law that she was treating my fianc√© poorly during her birthday?,"A few months ago, my fianc√© threw my SIL a surprise party that took a lot of time and energy and money to plan and set up. One of the coworkers she was coordinating with didn‚Äôt tell the other coworkers, but she managed to still get everyone on board in a few days, and it was successful. 

My fianc√© has always wanted a good surprise party, and mid-September my SIL told our friend group that she has something in the works for my fianc√©‚Äôs birthday. I told her that I should be in on that conversation because I also know some things that my fianc√© wants. No further discussion was had on the matter. I later found out that she also told my fianc√© directly not to plan for anything.

Then about 5 days before her birthday SIL texted (not sure if I can include text messages but I‚Äôll add them if I can) in a group chat ‚Äúare we doing anything for your birthday because my coworker is having a Halloween party?‚Äù This obviously hurt my fianc√©‚Äôs feelings. It upset me because that sounds to me like ‚ÄúAre we doing anything for your birthday which I said I would plan, because I really have something better to do that day.‚Äù That‚Äôs rude in my opinion. 

So I contacted a friend and asked if they could host at their house, I apologized for being last minute, especially because they have a baby on the way. They said they would of course be happy to host and would set things up. I contacted other people and across the board they all said thats obviously they would be there, one guy took off work early to make sure he could be on time. 

When I told SIL about the plans she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm supposed to have a Halloween party, but I hope my friends will understand‚Äù I took this as a reluctant agreement. Then she asked if she showed up 4 hours late if my fianc√© would be upset. I told her that I don‚Äôt know if she will be upset, but I certainly will be. 

Everyone arrived and they showed up, which was nice. SIL and her husband left early after changing into costumes. This made my fianc√© cry because she had hoped that her very close sister decided to be at her party instead of the other party. I caught them at their car before they left and told them that I‚Äôm really fucking disappointed with them. 

She texted me and said that I‚Äôm the asshole in this situation because she had these plans for weeks (after saying over a month ago that she was planning something) and that she is recently pregnant so she has other things on her mind, and that sometimes things are disappointing. 

I tried to keep the story concise but there are a couple other times something similar to this has happened and this is the straw that broke the camels back for me. My fianc√© has always wanted someone to plan a surprise party for her, and this soured the whole thing.

My mom died when I (17m) was 7. My brother was 6. When we were 10 and 11 our dad remarried. My dad's wife came with three daughters. Her youngest is a half sister to the two older ones. Older two are 16 and 14. Her youngest is 9. My dad and his wife also have a 4 and a 2 year old together.

So one thing that I should mention is my dad's wife lost her first husband, the dad of the older two. Her youngest was conceived not long after her husband's death. The dad of her youngest didn't want to know. And the girls never forgave her or got over her doing that so fast and they hate my youngest stepsister.

My brother and I don't hate anyone. But being honest I see him differently to the steps and halfs. I love my brother. I'd say he's my real sibling while the others are steps and halfs. I guess I'd say I'm mostly indifferent to them. I don't dislike them but I don't have their back always like I do for him. He's pretty much the same. Older steps don't like any of the rest of us and are hostile. The youngest step really wants her older sisters to love her. She doesn't really notice the rest of us. But it's very easy to see it breaks her heart when the other two want nothing to do with her and they treat her like she's disgusting. The youngest two are really little but will play together.

My dad and his wife had this dream that we'd be a way closer family unit and that we'd be more like an actual family than we are. Dad has talked to me about being the person who brings us all together as the oldest in the family. He told me I have such a good relationship with my brother and he wants us to have the same with the others. He asked me like a year ago if I didn't want that and I said no. Which made him interact with me differently.

This all brings us to yesterday. Youngest stepsister was supposed to be going to a birthday party. Dad was already at work. His wife was really sick. I had work too but in the past I called and said I'd be late to do something for my brother. My boss is cool with stuff like that. Oldest stepsister was going to a friends house and was passing the house the party was at. But she refused to take youngest stepsister. She left while her mom was trying to get her to take her. Middle stepsister also refused and left the house as well. My brother wasn't home and I left for work while dad's wife was comforting youngest stepsister, who was upset my other stepsisters wouldn't take her. When I got home last night dad called me an asshole and he told me I could have taken her and if she was my brother I would have called to be late to work and taken him. He told me I had the chance to really reach out and create a bond between me and her and I didn't and I showed him that I will always have a favorite and never try to hide it. He told me he's sick of the two of us sticking by each other but not doing the same for the others.

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-27,"AITA for not making my schedule work so my youngest stepsister could go to a party? There's some background that will provide some context about why dad's angry at me. My mom died when I (17m) was 7. My brother was 6. When we were 10 and 11 our dad remarried. My dad's wife came with three daughters. Her youngest is a half sister to the two older ones. Older two are 16 and 14. Her youngest is 9. My dad and his wife also have a 4 and a 2 year old together.

My sister has a friend who she is apparently close to, and which she has visited once or twice.

Now, my whole family is going to visit that friend's family in a week or so.

My mother wants me to give some of my notes to the friend's older brother, wo is one year younger than me. My mother says that it's okay if I only want to give a little, and that she understands that I, in particular, don't owe the brother anything. She says that she can scan and print some pages of my notes to give the mother of the friend, for her to check if it is legible, so I don't have to give away my original copy of my notes (though at first, that had been the plan, which I violently objected to)

I have chosen some notes that I am not extremely against sharing. My mother is not really pressuring me about this, but I hate, hate,¬†*hate*¬†that I have to give something so personal to someone who I don't give a single shit about.

But then she gets upset with me that I‚Äôm less than willing to grovel to her, when I just worked 24 out of the last 48 hours. She already has a bachelors degree, and attempted to start school again (she gave to because it was too stressful) and she isn‚Äôt extremely motivated to get a job yet due to the kids ages, and I put no pressure on her to do so. But I have suggested both options to her as either would help her generate her own money. The GI bill provides a monthly allowance if you‚Äôre a full time student. Job is self explanatory. On top of that she gets $600/month that I have never asked for even a dime of from a disability check. She could use this money to get a baby sitter quite frankly whenever. She doesn‚Äôt. Also, when the older two are in school M-F she can and does take the baby to the mommy-gym. Or she can read a book, go get a coffee, literally anything. So. I‚Äôm just out of gas when it comes to this conversation anymore. I am
A very helpful dad when I‚Äôm home, and have almost no hobbies of my own. Only to sneak away to the gym for an hour or two 1-2 times a week if I can! And I feel bad for the kids AND her because it ends up being long, less than beautiful days for everyone when she‚Äôs like this. Not saying necessarily that she‚Äôs TA, but AITA?",1.0,0.98987037,1,1
49,1gd6c3l,WIBTA if I didn't invite my childhood friends?,"I have some friends that I have been close with for a long time. I am hosting a party that is coming up in a few weeks and, while planning who to invite, I've been considering leaving them off.

I have a few different groupings of friends that I hang out with, and my two older friends have been fairly rude to some of my newer friends (ex. never talking to them when the others try to say something to them, completely ignoring them, whining about them to me in front of the others, constantly giving them the cold shoulder, etc.). Now, I'm not expecting all my friends to completely get along because I know they all are quite different, but this party I am planning to host is either the last, or second to last, big party I will get to have where I can hang out with and invite any of my friends that I want to (as many will be moving away soon). I want the party to be fun for everyone and not end badly with fights or drama, but I also know that the area I am hosting the party at is fairly small and doesn't give a ton of space for everyone to get away from one another. I have been toying with the idea of inviting everyone and just letting everyone know that they may not like all the guests, but I don't want my newer friends to not go specifically because they don't want to make things awkward.

I mentioned the guest list to a few of my friends (both older and newer) and they all have said it might be awkward being around each other in one room seeing as two of them seem to have problems with everyone else. I don't want to ruin everyone's enjoyment at this party, but I also want to invite all of my friends. I told one of my friends (one who complains about my newer friends a lot) about me planning to invite some people she doesn't like and she went on and on about how I was being selfish by inviting everyone and clearly just wanting drama. I told her that I just wanted all my friends to get along and snapped at her that if she could put her feelings behind her for one night, it wouldn't be awkward.

I already told my childhood friends bits and pieces about the party and they are expecting an invitation. I know that if I don't send it, they'll want an in-depth explanation that I can't provide.

51,1gd5xo5,AITA for letting my coworkers know that they are disrespectful?,"I (19M) currently work at a movie theater in New York. I just hit 3 years there and the job has been tons of fun. Yeah, there are some rough days, but I've honestly loved it. A big reason why I continue to work there is the group of people that I work with. Every couple of months, people come and go and the dynamic of the theater changes, and the current crop of workers that we have right now is a great bunch of workers who are quick, smart and hard working. However, there's one issue: they are very much night owls and love to party. Most nights, they stay up until 5 AM or so playing games on Discord, finding a 24/7 diner, staying at the theater to watch something, etc.

So last night, about 16 out of my 40 of my co workers threw an early Halloween party at one of their houses. I didn't attend, but I was in the group chat that was made for all the invited guests. From pictures and other gossip from people who attended, everyone had a lot of drinks and got pretty drunk. The party was also shut down around 2 AM as a neighbor apparently got mad at how loud they were, so they stopped early.

Fast forward to today, I had a closing 6-2 shift. Imagine how I felt when literally half of the people that attended the party called out or just didn't show up and told no one. This left me and 3 other people as well as one extra hand to run the entire theater on the floor on Venom opening weekend, and we were very understaffed. Mind you, they've had over 16 hours to feel better from the party, but they just decided to not show up. 

In a furious mood after work, I went onto the group chat and called out the people who didn't show up, calling them rude, irresponsible and disrespectful for not showing up to work when they knew that they were working the next day and had time to prepare themselves. Now I'm getting bashed in private DMs from people in the group chat saying that this was uncalled for and that I should've kept my thoughts to myself. 

I feel the reason I did this though was because this group of people always drink and party and usually show up late, but if they are now deciding to not show up period, and it's starting to get on my nerves. So I wrote out the message with the thought of giving them a warning, but now I don't know if I made the right choice or not. So AITA in this situation?

53,1gd5mjq,AITA for asking my parents to use a room in their house to take care of my grandma? ,"Hi, using a throwaway for the usual reasons. I live about 1200 miles from my family. We have always been close but this feels off to me. The issue is that my Grandma is dying. She is 96 and has had health problems before but has always pulled through. About 9 months ago she started having falls at home (she lived in a small place behind my parent's house so they could help her). My family decided she needed more help than they could give so she went to live in an assisted living facility. The care is awful and not long after moving in my grandma had a fall that broke her hip. She had surgery and a ton of drama later she was put back in the same facility. She did not want to go back but my Uncle who is her POA insisted so that's what happened.

This summer things were not good with her so I took some time off work to go see if I could help. I work in healthcare and knew they were feeling overwhelmed so I wanted to help. The facility was even worse than Grandma said and I spent my vacation helping her and talking to doctors and the facility to try to improve her situation but as soon as I left the agreements I reached with the facility were changed with my uncle (he is a good person he just does not understand what she needs) and her care got even worse. She has now had two more bad falls with the one two nights ago resulting in a broken neck. She is now on hospice and the doctor says she will not make a month.

Here is my problem. My family wants to return her to that facility saying that she is unresponsive for the most part and won't even know where she is so it's ok. I cant stand the thought of putting her back in that awful place to die. I talked to my husband and he agreed I need to go. I talked to my boss and was able to take a leave from work. I called my family to ask them to just make sure she is in a safe place till I can get there.

55,1gd4ypr,WIBTA Telling my grandmother off for expecting me to hide my cancer from her friends?,"Hey all, sorry if this post is a bit scattered, I have a lot of thoughts at the moment.

Some context, due to the housing crisis and other circumstances, me, my mother, and my grandparents are all living in the same house at the moment. Grandparents own the house.

A bit over 2 months ago I found out I had Skin Cancer. I have kept this secret from most of my family, besides my mother and siblings. The main reason for this is because my grandparents are hands down the most negative people I've ever met. They are horrible at communicating, both with each other and others. My grandma in particular is extremely narcissistic, and basically thinks she is perfect, and that her opinion is the only opinion. Basically I didn't want to deal with her BS while going through such a difficult time. 

Last week I had surgery to remove more of the area around the mole (on my leg), and a sentinel node biopsy around the groin, to check if the cancer has spread. At this point I decided that trying to hide it any longer was impractical, and I really just couldn't be bothered worrying about my family's behaviour instead of focusing all of my energy on beating this. My mother told my grandparents while I was at the hospital. 

Things have been ok for the most part, but for the first couple of days my grandmother was getting upset at me for talking and joking about it (I have a dark sense of humour and don't plan on changing that), which is partially how I've been dealing with it. I more or less let that go and just kinda ignored her, because I guess that is an understandable reaction.

However, yesterday she was talking about one of her (very few) friends, who is a nurse. She's nice enough but comes across as a bit of a know it all, and grandma complains about her behind her back quite a bit. She told me ""don't tell her, and if she comes over you'll have to hide in the bedroom for a while so she doesn't see your leg and start asking questions. I don't want to deal with her ringing up all the time and constantly asking how you are doing""

Ok.. first of all, as far as I'm concerned, NOBODY gets to have a say in who I tell or don't tell. That's my business and nobody else's!

Secondly, I'm obviously quite mad that she expects me to hide, because she can't have a proper adult conversation with another Human Being. I even said to her at the time ""So you'd prefer your cancer having grandson to hide away like I have something to be ashamed of, rather than just telling your friend that you'd rather not discuss it?"" To which she immediately bit back with ""Oh don't talk s***, do not tell her!""

I pretty much just walked away at that point, but I've been dwelling on it since yesterday, and am so mad that she seriously expects me to hide in the house I live in, perhaps for hours, just so she can avoid a real conversation. It makes me want to tell them out of bloody spite to be completely honest!

Sorry but I needed to vent, and would like to hear Reddit's thoughts. Thanks

Things have been ok for the most part, but for the first couple of days my grandmother was getting upset at me for talking and joking about it (I have a dark sense of humour and don't plan on changing that), which is partially how I've been dealing with it. I more or less let that go and just kinda ignored her, because I guess that is an understandable reaction.

However, yesterday she was talking about one of her (very few) friends, who is a nurse. She's nice enough but comes across as a bit of a know it all, and grandma complains about her behind her back quite a bit. She told me ""don't tell her, and if she comes over you'll have to hide in the bedroom for a while so she doesn't see your leg and start asking questions. I don't want to deal with her ringing up all the time and constantly asking how you are doing""

Ok.. first of all, as far as I'm concerned, NOBODY gets to have a say in who I tell or don't tell. That's my business and nobody else's!

Secondly, I'm obviously quite mad that she expects me to hide, because she can't have a proper adult conversation with another Human Being. I even said to her at the time ""So you'd prefer your cancer having grandson to hide away like I have something to be ashamed of, rather than just telling your friend that you'd rather not discuss it?"" To which she immediately bit back with ""Oh don't talk s***, do not tell her!""

I pretty much just walked away at that point, but I've been dwelling on it since yesterday, and am so mad that she seriously expects me to hide in the house I live in, perhaps for hours, just so she can avoid a real conversation. It makes me want to tell them out of bloody spite to be completely honest!

Sorry but I needed to vent, and would like to hear Reddit's thoughts. Thanks

56,1gd4yk9,AITA for cussing out my gf for fangirling over two celebrities?,"yeah it‚Äôs kinda complicated this one; so my gf (F27) and i (M26) were at a college homecoming party which is typically one the craziest block parties annually i was only there because my gf wanted me to do homecoming events with her and tht one seemed like it would be good for me. 

long story short, she decided to split up from her friend group to find another friend and tht actually made me mad bc i still needed the other friend who was our ride and had my backpack in the car. so we spent a lot of time looking for my gf‚Äôs friend group , and while we were posted up waiting somewhere with my arm around her waist, she turned around and said ‚Äúbabe omg it‚Äôs [rapper] and omgs it‚Äôs [streamer] and run up to give the streamer a tight hug around his neck. these aren‚Äôt just any celebrities. these are celebrities i literally despise for valid reasons and i‚Äôve told her this more than once. it could‚Äôve been anybody even chris brown and i wouldn‚Äôt have been mad but it was *these* particular celebrities. when they saw her run up to the streamer and hug him they started smiling and laughing and looking at me and i didn‚Äôt know if they were streaming but i saw someone with a tripod. then she begged me for a photo with the streamer and i muttered to her ‚Äúbabe you know i don‚Äôt fuck with this nigga‚Äù and she snapped at me and said to take the picture. and all the streamer could do was smile. i felt so embarrassed bc i feel like there‚Äôs a respectful way to ask a celebrity for a photo, ESPECIALLY if you‚Äôre in a relationship. celebs don‚Äôt like to be run up on unless it‚Äôs a pretty girl usually and this dude was smiling and enjoying it all. 

briefly lemme explain why i have a problem with these particular celebrities; i dislike the streamer because when he was a youtuber he had potential to make good content as a filmmaker but chose to just assert himself in stupid youtube drama for views and became a clout demon and even started boxing for clout. not only that ; he treats women so weirdly hes literally a pervert. so the fact i gotta take a pic of this nigga cheesing with his arm around my girl is foul. i acted like i was about to give him a handshake but i just said ‚Äúaye bro watch how you treat women‚Äù and he‚Äôs like ‚Äúwhatttt??? üòÖü§î‚Äù and his security is like ‚Äúhe‚Äôs good bro‚Äù. the other celebrity i dislike because he‚Äôs egotistical asf and doesn‚Äôt seem genuine at all. he used to be a youtuber and transitioned into being a shitty rapper and he never humbled himself. i hate seeing clips of him speak so disingenuously so seeing him in person wasn‚Äôt pleasant at all. 

she obviously thinks it‚Äôs just a photo. she ofc is downplaying the situation saying i‚Äôm overreacting and the situation is in the past and that she just wanted a photo with celebrities.

57,1gd4spa,AITA for not paying on my bucks night,"Three weeks ago, I had my bucks night with 10 of my closest friends. It was an amazing night, organized by my best friend, James, who I‚Äôve known since childhood. He did a great job, which was a surprise because he's not usually the best at organizing things. We went axe throwing, then to a pub for drinks, followed by dinner, and ended the night at a club.

This morning, James texted me asking when I could pay him back for what he spent on me during the bucks night. I found this strange because, at every bucks night I‚Äôve attended before, the group usually chips in extra to cover the buck so he doesn‚Äôt have to pay for anything. In fact, one of the groomsmen even made a speech at the start of the night, telling everyone to make sure I didn‚Äôt touch my wallet‚Äîthat they would cover everything. Anytime I didn‚Äôt have a drink in hand, someone would buy me one.

James claims he spent $250 on me and said he‚Äôs happy to cover $100 of it but would appreciate if I could pay him back the remaining $150. I asked my fianc√©e and another mutual friend (who couldn‚Äôt attend), and they both advised me that I shouldn‚Äôt be paying for anything.

I explained to James that usually, the amount spent on the buck is divided among the attendees, but he said he already collected money from the others and felt bad about asking them for more.

Later this afternoon, James called me, clearly upset, saying he felt let down because he did all the work to organise the night and that I wasn‚Äôt contributing.

59,1gd45db,AITA for going to bed and not waiting for the cookies to be done?,"
Okay I just really need an outside perspective here because I feel like I‚Äôm gonna lose my mind.

I (26F) live with my parents. I work full time and am in a masters program, so I‚Äôm pretty busy. A brief backstory: my mom (60F) is on a horrendous sleep schedule. Like she sleeps until noon or later and goes to bed at like 3 am. She has chronic health problems and she‚Äôs always been a‚Ä¶ *difficult* person even before she got sick but she‚Äôs my mom and I love her. For the most part, her wack schedule doesn‚Äôt affect me. Except for one major area. Dinner.

She likes to cook dinner on Wednesdays and Saturdays. And she normally doesn‚Äôt have the food ready until super late, think 10-11 at night. It‚Äôs mainly the Saturday dinners that are a problem. My grandpa (83M) visits us on Saturdays and he has bad dementia. He‚Äôs in that gray area where he has basically no short term memory but he isn‚Äôt quite bad enough for us to receive power of attorney over him, so it‚Äôs difficult. When she makes dinner, she stays in the kitchen all night cooking so it‚Äôs always me and my dad (60M) entertaining him. But when my dad grills, which he did tonight, that job falls solely on me and there are only so many racist, sexist rants I can handle. I love my grandpa but he‚Äôs not the same person he used to be; he‚Äôs very exhausting to be around and listen to. When you combine that with working all day, like I did today, well, suffice to say I‚Äôm dead on my feet.

It‚Äôs currently after midnight and my mom didn‚Äôt have dinner ready until close to 11:30. And then she insisted on throwing some cookies in the oven. I didn‚Äôt want to wait to eat the cookies, I‚Äôm already exhausted and wanted to just go to bed, so once I finished dinner, I sat at the table while my dad and my grandpa finished before getting up and announcing I was going to sleep.

My mom was not a fan of this. When she said didn‚Äôt I want a cookie, I asked if she‚Äôd save me a few for tomorrow. Her being her (passive aggressive like you wouldn‚Äôt believe and very easy to upset) snarked ‚Äúwell maybe I‚Äôll save you ONE.‚Äù When I tried to apologize and explain that I‚Äôm just really tired (got up at 7 today for work, worked all day, came home and sat with grandpa, you get it), she got really snippy with me and said she‚Äôs ‚Äúalso tired but don‚Äôt see her complaining‚Äù and then ended it with a super passive aggressive good night before I could try to say anything else. I didn‚Äôt want to deal with that so I just left.

AITA here? Is it so bad of me to want to go to bed? Am I being ungrateful or something? I‚Äôm appreciative that she cooks and I always thank her for the meal and I don‚Äôt complain about how late it gets but tonight, it‚Äôs just really not sitting right with me. I‚Äôve just been stretched thin lately and feel like maybe I‚Äôm crazy and maybe it is me that‚Äôs the problem here. I really don‚Äôt know what else I could‚Äôve done here.

I know moving out would fix this but since I work and am getting my masters, it‚Äôs just not feasible right now.

61,1gd3nwy,AITA for not going to a haunted house with my GF?,"My GF is really into things that are horror related. I don't mind most of it, but I'm not the biggest fan, its just not my thing really. She likes watching horror movies, and is a big fan of Halloween.

She begged me to go to a Halloween themed event with her a few weeks ago, that centred around 7 haunted houses. I really did not want to go, but I sucked it up, gave in and just did it because I know she really wanted. Each haunted house was like 5-10 mins, not the scariest thing tbh, but I didn't find it enjoyable.  I had to literally hype myself up before each one and take a breather afterwards.  I told her while we were leaving that after this, I'm done. I don't wanna go to anymore haunted houses.

Yesterday she sends me a link to a 'Haunted Office' event, which is basically some office building turned into a haunted house. It's in a downtown area of a big city at night. I told her I really don't wanna go, because haunted houses make me uncomfortable.  We get in an argument and she starts going off on me saying that a relationship is about making sacrifices.  If its something she enjoys, I should be willing to make the sacrifice and do it. She tells me that I care more about my 'comfort' than her safety since she's going to be downtown alone or with her friend at night.  She complained that she's going to an event for something she's not into for my hobby, but I'm not willing to do the same for her.

I bought tickets to an event related to one of my hobbies in a couple months. I know its not her thing and I'm not sure she'd really enjoy herself if she came.  I **asked** if she wanted to come with me to the event, and go on a bit of a road trip. I would have gone alone if she didn't want to come, I didn't pressure her into coming.

I don't see these events as truly comparable. I don't mind if she doesn't go to my event, I only asked if she wants to come.  This event doesn't make her uncomfortable, it's just not her hobby.

Honestly, I think this entire situation is beyond stupid and juvenile.  To go off an have a fight over a haunted house? She says my explanation of it making me feel 'uncomfortable' is unacceptable and insufficient justification.  Claims it 'says a lot more about me'.

This week my dad started an argument with  my 3 underage nieces which caused them to be very upset and ‚Äúban‚Äù him from family events. They texted me and because it didn‚Äôt concern me, I ignored them. Also, it didn‚Äôt seem like a big deal because maybe the beta blocker calming effect. My husband replied something like ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too bad, sorry‚Äù. 

Later, my brother called to tell me my nieces were mad that I didn‚Äôt reply and I‚Äôd now damaged my relationship with them because I wasn‚Äôt condemning my parents. I told him though there was no love lost with my parents, I didn‚Äôt want to be put in the middle. I was sorry for the situation but I didn‚Äôt do anything wrong and didn‚Äôt need to be involved. 

The next day I received this text from my 17 year old niece: 

Just incase it wasn‚Äôt clear i definitely am not coming by this weekend. I understand you didn‚Äôt want to get involved to maintain your relationship with your parents but you did greatly damage the one between you and your nieces. I am appalled with your lack of sympathy. You could have at least said you are sorry. Please don‚Äôt bother responding to this message like you didn‚Äôt respond to any of my previous ones.

First, I initiated a conversation with my roommates, in which we discussed rules for the apartment. In this discussion, we decided to buy stickers in different colors to label the food we bought for personal use accordingly.

It started with bread. Even though it was labeled, someone had been taking my bread. What particularly annoyed me about this was that they didn't put it back right. It was sitting on the counter with the endpiece flipped vertically and a giant pocket of air at the top, making it prone to becoming stale.

Hey everyone, I'm new to Reddit and never thought I'd post here, but I need to know if I'm wrong on this.

Me 19F, and my sister 26F, we get along well the n general although lately we've been having communication issues as we both find ourselves irritable, her because of work stress and me because of college.

Lately we don't talk much, and more since she once told me ""I don't want to know anything about what happens in your studies, it's disgusting or boring"", to be clear, I study a career in the health sector, so before I used to talk about what was coming in classes, the human body is fascinating, but I think I was talking so much about that so I annoyed her and I understand it, not everyone likes the same topics.

Am I the idiot for not or showing a tiktok to my sister after she said ""no""?

Hey everyone, I'm new to Reddit and never thought I'd post here, but I need to know if I'm wrong on this.

Me 19F, and my sister 26F, we get along well the n general although lately we've been having communication issues as we both find ourselves irritable, her because of work stress and me because of college.

Lately we don't talk much, and more since she once told me ""I don't want to know anything about what happens in your studies, it's disgusting or boring"", to be clear, I study a career in the health sector, so before I used to talk about what was coming in classes, the human body is fascinating, but I think I was talking so much about that so I annoyed her and I understand it, not everyone likes the same topics.

Essentially, there was a line to order some snacks at this small shop at a corn maze. The shop was small and the line extended from the register straight to the entrance. When I entered, I got in line right away, and had to step to the right a little bit (there was no one to the left at the time), and I confirmed with the people in front that they were at the end of the line. 

After a minute or so, there was this lady and her son standing to the left of the line, and she tells her son ""I'm in line. Can you wait here while I grab something?"" and then she walks away to grab something. At that time, the line moved up one person, and her kid moved in front of me. I legit thought they were cutting (it didn't occur to me at the time that they could've overlooked me), but I just waited since I didn't want to say anything to the kid (maybe 12-13 years old).

When mom came back, I said the line is back there (there were already some others behind me before mom left), and she said ""Oh he was holding my spot."" I said ""I know, but idk why he was there.""

Then she said ""It's ok. I'll go to the back. I don't want this to cause any issues."" 

I didn't say anything after, but as she got to the back, the few people behind me told her ""Wow. that's ridiculous. never seen anything like this before. You can go in front of us if you want.""

80,1gcywjc,AITA for telling my cousin that she is disorganised.,"I (21F) am visiting my cousin (20F). I have not seen her for almost 9 years but we have kept in contact during the whole time.

I finally decided to visit her and bought tickets to see her in Paris. I am from New Zealand so it is far. When I consolidated my plans to book, she reassured me that her university schedule is flexible and she can easily take an online course during the time I am there.

As I decided to book for around 1 month, I also wanted to make plans to travel to other places. One of them being London in the UK. Initially she decided that she will take an online course for the month we were there, so we had the flexibility to choose a date. However, she later changed her mind and decided that she did not want to do her course online. We later decided on a date in December.

Furthermore, she also requires a visa to enter the UK as she is a citizen of a country that does not have visa-free travel. In doing so, she mentioned that as a part of her application she will need to book her return train tickets to UK. As soon as she mentioned it (late September), I booked them and let her know. We decided to book separately as she is unaware of her uni schedule and to give her flexibility. She continued to say she would book it tomorrow/I am tired I will do this later etc. However, around one month later, she only just lodged her application and she herself did not end up buying her train tickets. My family/myself are paying for accomodation so she only had to buy the train tickets.

Now, the price of a train ticket has almost doubled in price, compared to what I paid. Hence, she is now considering taking a plane into the country. I calculated the price difference and the price of plane tickets now are more expensive compared to the train fares I paid.

I feel a little annoyed because I have spent a lot of time and effort to book this trip and I feel that I am always the one taking initiative to book things. I too am a uni student. I went through the effort of finding accomodation and booking it. We have also booked trips to other countries and I also was the one to find flights/book accomodation and sort it [out.UK](http://out.UK) accomodation is expensive so I thought it would be fair for her to book her own train ticket. It also feels not as fun to have us go on different modes of transport.

I told her that I am annoyed with her actions and it feels like I am the only one taking initiative. I said she was disorganised. She said that she has not been able to book because she did not have a card like I did. However, she does live with her parents and they knew they were financing portions of her trip so she could have asked her parents if she could book the tickets. 

Hence, AITA for being annoyed at my cousin and telling her that she is disorganised?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-27,"AITA for telling my cousin that she is disorganised. I (21F) am visiting my cousin (20F). I have not seen her for almost 9 years but we have kept in contact during the whole time.

I finally decided to visit her and bought tickets to see her in Paris. I am from New Zealand so it is far. When I consolidated my plans to book, she reassured me that her university schedule is flexible and she can easily take an online course during the time I am there.

As I decided to book for around 1 month, I also wanted to make plans to travel to other places. One of them being London in the UK. Initially she decided that she will take an online course for the month we were there, so we had the flexibility to choose a date. However, she later changed her mind and decided that she did not want to do her course online. We later decided on a date in December.

Furthermore, she also requires a visa to enter the UK as she is a citizen of a country that does not have visa-free travel.
