0,1gea4xm,AITA for calling my Mum out for driving high as well as bring up related childhood trauma,"Tl:dr: Mum has been driving high daily since her partner passed, including getting high with my younger siblings who both have Psychotic based mental illnesses and were both sectioned the last time she enabled them to smoke weed. I called her out and all hell has broken loose. 

My Step Dad (mum's partner) passed a couple of months ago. Since then she has been visiting my younger sibling and smoking Cannabis with them, and a significant amount at that, then driving home high. She has had some minor accidents driving home but left them all unreported (all empty cars). 

Tonight she came home so high she was slurring her words and genuinely ridiculously out of it. I sent her a huge rambling message pointing out the problems in her behaviour. 

This included the following points:

1. She is risking lives of others by driving high
2. She is risking sibling she is smoking with as she was sectioned for Psychosis last time she smoked it and lost custody of her daughter as a result
3. Risking OTHER sibling that lives with us as he is Schizophrenic and when she last enabled him to smoke it he was also sectioned
4. That I'm currently undergoing immunotherapy which causes me significant nausea, migraines etc and the pungent smell on her is making me feel much worse
5. That she was at least partly responsible for younger siblings both being sectioned previously due to same actions 
6. That I had to raise younger sibling when I myself was a child (I'm a decade older) because she spent all her time alone in her room getting high and I had to pick up the slack and I find it triggering she is being selfish again in similar way (she had quit for the past few years up until partner's recent passing)
7. Generally her actions are selfish and her late partner would be disappointed she's risking people's lives and health 
8. That we currently have a child family member staying with us and they shouldn't have to witness their grandparent acting so visibly ""weird"" 

Now, I know it was probably a bit passive aggressive to send this in a text rather than talk in person, but usually she will literally throw a tantrum if I do anything she dislikes in person. 

But anyway, she still kicked off, trashing the house and scaring our pets and the kid living with us. 

Now, I live with her but that is purely because my sibling that lives at home (Schizophrenic) has very high care needs and I am his sole carer. I wish I could leave but unfortunately doing so would risk his life, and I am not selfish enough to do that. 

Did I cross the line in the points I raised?

For context, my dad remarried when I was 6, he got custody of me when I was 14. Since getting custody she treated me terrible & was upset with my dad 24/7 about me.

They moved over 3 hours away & I visited about every 5 months of so, he came down for my sons birthday party’s/ holidays etc. about a month ago I found out he was talking to his ex wife again & he said they were just trying to be friends as my dad is in his 50s and wanted to talk to somebody. I was really trying to see his point of view & mind my business. From the past month she’s been driving up to see him, going to concerts together & staying at hotels together. Then they came to town & tried to hide it? It didn’t bother me that they weren’t coming to visit me, it’s the fact that they tried to be secretive & hide the fact that they came to town for her. I just don’t feel it’s fair to play both sides & drag my son around to play whenever they wanna play grandparents.

We were literally sisters at this point and didn't think anything would break that bond. I liked her because she never sugar coated anything, very fierce and funny.

She always acted broke and going through things everytime I tried to intiate things like hangouts or lunch. She would.always post on her story hanging out with her other friends. I accepted that reality and still played it cool. Then she got an internship at a government organisation. They paid them every now and then. I don't know how much since she never told me anything about it. I found out when she posted a bank notification of the payment on her story. She became very arrogant and acted like she was better than the rest of us. Then she upgraded her phone from an android to an iphone and the situation just got worse. She would abuse me even when I came in peace. Less communication but always posted with her other friends . It got so bad we stopped talking and when I chose to address it She played the "" I'm going through alot "" card. I also didn't stress it just let her be. The only time we talk is when she wants to gossip about someone which I realised ain't helping our situation at all.

3,1ge9rb8,WIBTA for Moving out of MIL House,"Hi all, I have a really strange situation I’m hoping to get a neutral third party perspective on. 
My husband, toddler and I currently live with my MIL. We also have another baby on the way. We all rent a house together and she relies on our portion of rent to live here. She has the master bedroom, only garage space, has decorated the entire house to her liking, takes up 99% of kitchen storage space, and has her own office. My husband, daughter, and I occupy less than 500 sq feet of space between the three of us. My husband and I have a tiny bedroom that barely fits a queen bed. My daughter has her own room. We have an unattached bathroom. We also have a cat and dog. The cat has to live in our room and is not allowed to free roam as he may scratch her furniture. She also has a dog, and that has been an issue as well. Her dog is a 90+ pound pitbull that regularly gets “too excited” and knocks our daughter over and won’t stop kissing her. She has hit her head badly from this several times and I am concerned for her safety. The dog also begs for food anytime someone is eating and will jump up to grab food off my daughter’s high chair tray. Very little accountability has been taken to train the dog or acknowledge its behavior other than putting it in its crate. In fact, our dog is often blamed for this behavior because he barks which “gets the dog going”. 
Here’s my issue: clearly this living situation no longer feels suitable. We already don’t have enough space with my toddler and we will quickly run out of room when our newborn is here. We’ve already been declined on putting a rocking chair in the upstairs loft that nobody uses. It’s an issue to transition her office into a nursery for the baby. We really just want to move and we’d prefer they get their own place. 
We currently pay half of all bills, except grocery bills, which we pay roughly 80% of. When we moved into this living situation, no boundaries were set around rent and we had to make them up as we went along. We were originally each paying $900 a month and we experienced a tragedy in our family that set us back on paying rent. Due to that we had several months of unpaid rent and it got her into a rough financial situation. I’ve since paid my MIL $5000 to make up for this, and have taken over a larger portion of bills. However, I feel it’s now become unbalanced on the other end. It is really emotionally exhausting and frustrating living here. I’m sad this is our life and our children’s lives. I don’t see a way out. We could financially afford to move, but I don’t want to leave her hanging after she helped us when we were in a tough spot. The situation is so toxic for so many more reasons than I can even list. We are technically on a lease for 1.5 more years, but the lease is technically invalid because another roommate never signed it. I really want to move but don’t feel like it’s morally ethical- but my little family is suffering as a result.

4,1ge9clw,AITA For Demanding That My Wifes Best Friend go to Rehab,"I (31M) demanded that we cut her best friend off after she stole and drank 2 bottles of alcohol and stole my wife's (27F) car, drove it while intoxicated and high on cocaine. Just a little bit of a backstory, when I first met my wife, she told me that there is no helping her best friend (27F) who we will call Carrie. Carrie who already lives in an abusive marriage. A few months ago, we decided to help her and take her into our home so that she could be away from her husband during her separation. After she moved in, she decided to get into another relationship with a new guy that was also her cocaine dealer. Well, he decided to pretty much live there, not only to control her but to enable her, which prevented her to heal. This has been going on for about 7 months now and yesterday was the final straw the broke the camel's back for me.

My wife is 25 weeks pregnant with our first child, and we had gone to Las Vagas for a mini-Vacation. On our 6 1/2-hour drive back Carrie calls us in a complete mental breakdown because of some things that her dad had said to her. After she got off the phone with us, she decides to drink 2 full bottles of our alcohol that I use to make herbal tinctures. Then she steals my wife's car, drives it to her cocaine dealer, takes cocaine and drives to her now ex-husbands home. After she get there, he calls her mom, and her mom goes there to check on her. Her mom shows up and finds her upside down in the car and unconscious. Her mom immediately takes her to the ER. After arriving to ER, she becomes belligerent and pissed off that she is in the hospital. On a side note, she has been for the past few years had her husband saying things like if you get admitted to the hospital, I am taking away your kids. My wife on the other hand has said many times that there is no helping her, and you cannot force her to do anything otherwise she will shut down.

I believe that getting her professional help is the only way that she can get better and straighten out her life.

6,1ge8v43,AITA for taking my roommates mirror without asking even though I was trying to do a gesture I thought was nice,"AITA for “borrowing” my roommate’s 300-pound antique mirror?

Okay, so hear me out: I (23F) live with my roommate “Nina” (24F), who is basically the queen of thrifting. She’s one of those people who has a sixth sense for finding super cheap, amazing stuff at flea markets, and I admit it’s pretty impressive. Our apartment looks like a Pinterest board, all thanks to her.

Anyway, a few months ago, Nina found this massive antique mirror. Like, this thing could easily cover an entire wall. She was obsessed with it and kept talking about how it “pulled the room together.” To be fair, it does look cool, but it’s also 300 pounds, and I’m constantly terrified it’ll come crashing down and flatten me.

Fast forward to last weekend. My best friend was throwing a Murder Mystery Dinner Party for her birthday, and we were all supposed to dress up and go all out with “luxurious” props. Naturally, I thought of Nina’s giant mirror. I figured I’d surprise everyone by turning up with a literal “mirror of mystery.”

Here’s where I might be the jerk: Nina was out of town, so I didn’t exactly ask her if I could borrow it. I enlisted three friends to help me lift it, got it in an Uber (barely), and brought it to the party. And let me tell you—it was a HIT. Everyone was taking selfies with it and doing dramatic “mirror, mirror on the wall” quotes. It was kind of the star of the show.

…Until I got it back to the apartment and noticed a huge crack down the side. It turns out that maneuvering a 300-pound mirror through doorways and stuffing it into an Uber multiple times wasn’t the best idea. The frame was a little banged up too, and one corner was chipped. I tried to set it back in its usual spot and hoped Nina wouldn’t notice, but she obviously did the second she got home.

Now she’s furious, calling me irresponsible and saying I shouldn’t have touched it. I told her I was only trying to add to the “mystique” of the party and I’d split the cost of repairs. But she says it’s a one-of-a-kind piece and that I “ruined the energy” of the mirror.",TL;DR,2024-10-28,"AITA for taking my roommates mirror without asking even though I was trying to do a gesture I thought was nice AITA for “borrowing” my roommate’s 300-pound antique mirror?

7,1ge8tcp,WIBTA for asking for early payment,Hey guys. So Basically me and my boyfriend are going to rolling loud Miami in December. Both of us work at the same place and get paid weekly. The event is in early-ish December and we have booked the airbnb and need to book the car rental. I’ve been putting money towards this stuff ever since we booked in August. I have anxiety when it comes to paying stuff like this and would rather get it out the way asap. I’ve communicated to him that I want to pay it off asap so we can spend other money on other things we want. I already paid some of my part of the airbnb. I asked him when he would give his half of the money for the rental and airbnb which is due on Nov 29 and he told me he would do it in the middle or end of November with no specific date.

So Basically me and my boyfriend are going to rolling loud Miami in December. Both of us work at the same place and get paid weekly. The event is in early-ish December and we have booked the airbnb and need to book the car rental. I’ve been putting money towards this stuff ever since we booked in August. I have anxiety when it comes to paying stuff like this and would rather get it out the way asap. I’ve communicated to him that I want to pay it off asap so we can spend other money on other things we want. I already paid some of my part of the airbnb. I asked him when he would give his half of the money for the rental and airbnb which is due on Nov 29 and he told me he would do it in the middle or end of November with no specific date. The thing is he’s telling me he paid his gym membership forward all the way to the middle of next year but we still have stuff to get for this trip. Would I be the asshole for saying that I want to pay all of this off asap so we don’t have to worry about it? I don’t want it to seem like I’m pocket watching but I feel it would make more sense to get the important stuff out of the way and not wait until the last minute.,1.0,0.039319515,0,0
8,1ge8qk4,AITA - for staying out late with my friends and getting too carried away. ,"I (26M) went out with my friends last night and my GF (25F) got angry with me. What happens next? 

So yesterday, I went out with my friends and got pretty drunk. I didn’t do anything wrong in my eyes and I just got carried away with my friends in a ‘good time’. My girlfriend was working (she’s a night nurse) and I ended up staying out with them pretty late. Almost until the bars closed. My friends and I just had a lot of laughs and a good time. I didn’t talk to any girls or do anything I shouldn’t be doing like I said. 

Everything was fine with our communication and she has my location and I didn’t move or go to a different bar. I just stayed at the same one with my friends for a long time. We were probably there for about 6 hours since there was a big game on and we got there early to get a spot. Anyways, me and my friends were noticeably getting pretty drunk and then my gf texted me and said “you’re still out? Don’t they close in 30 minutes” and I said yeah we are about to leave soon and order an uber. Then she proceeded to say “why are you still there. It’s been almost 10 hours like wtf are you doing” and then I said we are on our way back and she proceeded to text back and say “I’m legit pissed. Why the hell were you at a bar for 10 fucking hours what the fuck is wrong with you”

I really feel like this is a dramatic response and reaction. I also wasn’t there for 10 hours. Like I get it, I was out drinking for a long time and got carried away and that can be annoying. But you don’t have to get that pissed off at me. I also don’t do this ever at all and I don’t go out to the bars every weekend or something like that. I can’t remember the last time I went out to a bar and got as drunk as I did, and maybe that’s why she was annoyed. But you don’t get to react this way…  This isn’t the first time she has talk to me like that too. I have expressed that she needs to control her reactions better and not talk to me like the way she does when she gets upset. She says she will work on it but then does things like this. I’m struggling to understand her reaction to this and I’m afraid that this is a foundational issue in our relationship that hasn’t been fixed. I am starting to feel it won’t be fixed either. How do I handle this situation? Should she be reacting this intensely to something like this or am I the asshole?

9,1ge8c1f,AITA for expecting my friend to keep the terms of our loan? ,"For Context: I 28M have had a friend 30F going on 5 years. We’ve always been pretty close and I can confide in her and not expect any judgement.

I’ve been with my GF 25F a year now, but we’ve been on and off for 3 years. She weird about me having girl friends. Especially this particular friend. And I can understand it to a certain extent. In the past me and my friend may have shared feelings, a bit of flirting but we’ve never crossed that line because the friendship was just to good. 

Recently my GF said she’s not comfortable with us hanging out because we’re just to close and she thinks my friend has a crush. I explained to my friend I can’t hang out with her any longer but we could still exchange text occasionally.

Now here’s the thing, I was in a tight spot after a medical accident and my friend loaned me about 8000 dollars. 6000 I’ve paid back, the deal was that I’d pay her 200 a month for the rest of it. But now she’s saying that she wants it back now since I’m “choosing” not to be her friend. And I should ask my GF for the money.

To be that’s just spiteful and if she cares she’d understand the position I’m in. I also don’t really have the money to give and know my gf doesn’t. I also never told her about the situation I’m in.

My friend is saying if I don’t get her the money, she’ll send the request to my gf and expose a bunch of other stuff. I think that’s blackmail, but she’s saying it’s her money to begin with and I’m an AH if I think she should keep the original terms. So AITA?

Years ago I noticed that they'd make excuses about why they needed my help. I told mom and dad it was bullshit and they just wanted to spend time with me. My parents acknowledged once that my siblings were just making excuses, but they told me I should appreciate it because it meant they loved me.

A very common thing to happen is I'll be about ready to leave for work or meet up with friends for something we planned/to do a school project together. Then suddenly a piece of homework that only I can help with will come up and can't I please just cancel my plans to help because my siblings need their homework done.

Another common thing is I'm ready for a party and one or both of my siblings come to me with kicked puppy expressions and beg me to say because they miss me and I'm always busy doing something else. And they want to spend time with their big brother.

My parents pressure me to stay, my siblings beg and sometimes even do the whole drop to knees and clench their hands together in prayer type of begging. There have been consequences for me trying to continue with my plans. I already lost one job because of this.

I spoke with my parents on a few occasions and I got both sets of grandparents to help me two different times. My parents blew us all off.

Now, the dates have been changed, the classmates offered some lame ass apology where they said that it was in the best interest of everyone, and my schedule has been f-ed.

14,1ge7kea,AITA for telling my vegan friend I don’t want to come over for Thanksgiving Dinner?,"  I (54f) have a friend (55f) who went vegan 10 years ago. We’ve been friends 20 years or more. We have a large group of friends 15-20 and there are a few of us that switch off cooking dinner on Thanksgiving for whoever is in town. 
Since “Ann” went vegan we’ve always accommodated her dietary restrictions with at the very least some tofurkey, one side dish and one dessert being strictly vegan.  
  This year Ann jumped in early and for the first time ever said she wanted to cook Thanksgiving this year. Not a problem. Until she informed us in the group chat dinner will be 100% vegan. Some of us offered to bring more omnivore offerings, including a turkey and she insisted we eat vegan while at her house. She declared that vegan food “tastes exactly the same” as omnivore food. It does not. I’ve been to her house and choked down bean burgers and chocolate cake and probably a dozen other meals each of which she insisted tasted just like the real thing. She even tried to fool me once with a beyond burger, insisting is was a regular hamburger. 
  I have only found a limited number of vegan dishes I enjoy and none of them have ever been made by her. 
After thinking it over and discussing it with my husband we decided to privately tell her we were bowing out of dinner on Thanksgiving this year. I told her I wanted turkey, mashed potatoes, pumpkin pie that were made with traditional ingredients. 
  I could have lied and said we had plans to travel to see family but I don’t want lie. 
  Ann has become angrier and angrier with me since I told her this about a week ago. Then she went and complained to some of the women in our group about me refusing to attend just because she’s cooking. 

Which is sort of true but still made me angry. So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it’s really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. 

  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)

  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies. 

  I’ve decided to stay out of it from here on out but somehow Anna blames me for the whole debacle. AITA for declining to attended a vegan thanksgiving?

So I ended explaining to the other ladies that we all very considerately make vegan dishes just for her at every party and get together any of us throw and it’s really unreasonable for her to insist that I strictly adhere to her dietary choices when I have never demanded the same from her. 

  So that blew up because all the ladies have now jumped to my way of thinking and decided they will have Thanksgiving at one of their houses instead. (We will not be attending their Thanksgiving either)

  My husband says we probably should have lied about going out of town or at the very least I should have not explained my reasoning to the other ladies. 

  I’ve decided to stay out of it from here on out but somehow Anna blames me for the whole debacle. AITA for declining to attended a vegan thanksgiving? ",0.0,0.060598828,0,1
15,1ge7ht7,AITA for using my daughter's Amazon gift card?,"I (35f) and my family (husband 37m, daughter 11f, and daughter 6f) just attended a Halloween party where my oldest daughter was awarded first place in the costume contest. 

Some back story; I spent the last 3 months planning, designing, and hand making all of our costumes. We went as Alice in Wonderland characters. I was the white rabbit, husband was Mad Hatter, youngest was Alice, and oldest was Queen of Hearts. Her costume was by far the most involved and difficult for me. I literally broke down in tears over the standing collar 3 days before the party. My daughter, though she is very creative and artistic, did not give me much input into the costume aside from a few ideas on details and encouragement throughout the process. Tbf I didn't expect her to, she's not as into Halloween or dressing up as I am. 

The day of the party, all the elements came together perfectly. Her costume was one of the best I've made, her hair and accessories were perfect. And out of 30+ people, her costume won the contest. I was very proud watching her accept her prize which was a trophy and a gift bag. When she sat down to look in the gift bag, she showed me the candle which I took to believe was the only thing in the bag. 

Later in the night, I was informed that there was also a $50 Amazon gift card in the bag. I found my daughter and teased her that she conveniently forgot to show me the gift card and that technically it should be mine since I did all the work (even though I actually had no intentions of taking it.) She got really flustered and upset but didn't say anything. Later her dad (my husband) found out about the gift card and also mentioned that it should be mine. At this, my daughter got upset again and said it should be hers since the prize was awarded to her. I told her she could have the gift card if I could keep the trophy out in the library and not buried in her room, to which she begrudgingly obliged. 

We've all had 2 nights to think on it and I still believe that the gift card should go to me, but let me be clear that I do not intend to use the gift card, I only want my daughter to admit that I earned that prize and maybe a thank you for my months of hard work. I'm only making this post either for commenters to help me see how I'm wrong or for validation. 

Ps, I'm not on reddit a lot so I apologize if my post is not how it's normally done. 

Edit: it's clear from the first few comments that i am in the wrong. I will not bring it up to her anymore, and she will be allowed to spend the gift card how she wants. Thanks everyone :)

One recurring thing that is difficult is that she has frequent ups and downs that impact her ability to deal with what life throws at her, so to speak. She frequently struggles with organization, job stability, and meeting her own needs. She is in therapy and on medication for ADHD. I empathize with all of this and have been trying to show up for whatever I can without sacrificing my own mental health: I help with chores, child care, daily tasks, and emotional support quite often. We do not live together and this is one reason why I have not taken that step, I have my own history of depression and anxiety and I fear cohabitating like this will trigger my own issues. 

I suppose the burnt out feeling comes from the fact that I routinely get texts and messages from her about how stressful and unfair everything is in her life, about how she is personally being victimized, and there is a lot of relinquishing of control in these messages. I am not a person who likes a pity party, I have been through really hard stuff in my life and tbh she has a good support system and I just feel like sometimes she is just wallowing because it’s comfortable for her. But this all impacts our relationship and our future together, and I just feel very exhausted by all of it at this point. We have talked about it, both productively and not so productively.

I am feeling really burnt out from hearing about her struggles and subsequent learned helplessness so often.

I don’t know how to support her while not enabling these behaviors and sometimes I just want to say, “suck it up and handle your shit” (I don’t, I just want to..)

22,1ge6w8i,AITA that i reacted negatively to my BF fiend's girlfriend and cause a strain in their relationship? ,"
I recently moved in europe, im asian and moved because my partner and i wanted to take the next step for the relationship.

Everything is new to me and tbh its my first time moving in and living with a guy and meeting other cultures.

My boyfriend have a very close friend and dating a iranian girlfriend for the past 6years. Ive only met her 3 times, it was when we went to bowling, his birthday party and movie night. 

The problem starts on the 3rd time i hang out with them. We were invited to go on movie night, we went, and brought some snacks, we picked the movie called OUTSIDE that was actually produced in my country. Its a zombie movie and a drama. During the movie my boyfriend's friend girlfriend made a joke about how my language sound, at first i was like ""haha thats how my language sound"" it was weird but i didnt really mind it, but she made the same joke again, copying the way they speak but like ""blublublu"" and laughing, i didnt say anything and neither the two guys. I thought it was nothing, but she did it again and like before nobody said anything. 

By that time I was offended but i was still unsure what to react so i let it happen and acted like its nothing during that time. After the movie i just told my partner that im sleepy and want to go home so they talked a bit and then we went home. On the way i started subbing and told my bf about what i feel about the joke she made.

My boyfriend apologize that he didn't notice it but i asked him if it was racist because honestly this is my first time having this experience. He said yeah it was a bad taste. 

After that night my boyfriend message his friend saying that I was offended and frustrated about the joke his girlfriend friend did. His reply was really nice and said she didn't mean it and that he apologized he didn't notice it too. And my boyfriend just replied that he was glad he understands.

Then after that his friend message him that maybe they shouldn't see each other anymore. Like cutting the friendship! I was really shocked bc that wasn't my intention, im not angry and maybe she didn't think it was racist but i never wanted my boyfriend to lose a friend because of me. Now i feel like a big asshole costing my boyfriend to lose a 16 years of friendship.

23,1ge6ur8,AITA telling my sister I’m done hearing her complain ,"My sister has been with her high school sweetheart for 14 years now. They had a baby at 21 and broke up when the baby was around 18 months because he had lost his job and wasn’t making any effort to find another job (he also wasn’t helping much around the house). My sister was in financial trouble and had to sell her house because she could afford it anymore. They started a relationship again after a while and once they were in a good place, my sister bought another house and they had another baby at 27 years old. The baby is now 18 months and coincidentally enough he lost his job again and the same cycle has reappear, my sister is again having financial problems and my mom and I are trying our best to help her.

I live with them and had to work from home full time for a couple of weeks. My BIL would wake up around noon, play videos games and start “cleaning” around 4pm (my sister comes home with the kids at 5pm), his cleaning consist of reorganizing the kitchen (not actually cleaning the kitchen) and doing laundry. I’m my sisters main confidant, she’s talks to me about her frustrations toward my BIL and I try my best to listen and give her support. But I’ve develop some frustration because she’s always so lovey dovey with him and goes to his defence if I say anything “bad” about him. 

This weekend I cleaned the bathroom and their kitchen while they were both on the couch cuddling. After that, I played with my niece, my sister came to see us and I asked her if someone could pass the mop, she told me she was so tired she didn’t want to do any cleaning. I got frustrated and told her to stop talking and go. Several minutes later I confronted her alone and told her I couldn’t hear her complaining anymore, I told her I couldn’t understand how she was still with my BIL and that I was mad that I try to help her as much as I can around the house but I get shitted at if I ask for something. I said I understood why SHE didn’t want to pass the mop but that she could ask my BIL because he doesn’t do shit. She didn’t say anything, I think she was too stunned and we haven’t spoken about it either.

",No A-holes here,2024-10-28,"AITA telling my sister I’m done hearing her complain  My sister has been with her high school sweetheart for 14 years now. They had a baby at 21 and broke up when the baby was around 18 months because he had lost his job and wasn’t making any effort to find another job (he also wasn’t helping much around the house). My sister was in financial trouble and had to sell her house because she could afford it anymore. They started a relationship again after a while and once they were in a good place, my sister bought another house and they had another baby at 27 years old. The baby is now 18 months and coincidentally enough he lost his job again and the same cycle has reappear, my sister is again having financial problems and my mom and I are trying our best to help her.

I live with them and had to work from home full time for a couple of weeks. My BIL would wake up around noon, play videos games and start “cleaning” around 4pm (my sister comes home with the kids at 5pm), his cleaning consist of reorganizing the kitchen (not actually cleaning the kitchen) and doing laundry. I’m my sisters main confidant, she’s talks to me about her frustrations toward my BIL and I try my best to listen and give her support. But I’ve develop some frustration because she’s always so lovey dovey with him and goes to his defence if I say anything “bad” about him. 

This weekend I cleaned the bathroom and their kitchen while they were both on the couch cuddling. After that, I played with my niece, my sister came to see us and I asked her if someone could pass the mop, she told me she was so tired she didn’t want to do any cleaning. I got frustrated and told her to stop talking and go. Several minutes later I confronted her alone and told her I couldn’t hear her complaining anymore, I told her I couldn’t understand how she was still with my BIL and that I was mad that I try to help her as much as I can around the house but I get shitted at if I ask for something.

24,1ge6j2t,AITA for sleeping in my own bed?,"live with my girlfriend, and I work from home. She just started a new job a couple of weeks ago, which has her going into the office every day. Today, I started feeling like I’m coming down with something—a bit of a cold or the flu, just feeling drained, headache, chills, that kind of thing.

She mentioned that she really can’t afford to get sick right now since she’s so new at work and doesn’t want to take sick days yet. She asked if I’d keep my distance from her, which is fair enough, but then she asked if I’d sleep on the sofa.

I told her no—I don’t think it’s fair for me to get kicked out of my own bed especially when I'm I'll and need a good nights sleep. I said if she really wants to avoid catching anything, she could take the sofa instead.

She said I should care about not getting her sick, but I pointed out that if she wants to be careful, she could sleep in the other room just as easily. She thinks I’m being unreasonable and said it’s just for a few nights, but I pointed out that goes both ways; she could just as easily sleep on the sofa.

25,1ge6cnr,AITA GF lied about going to school?,"M25 my girlfriend is 23 When we first started dating last December she had just finished her fall college classes and told me she was going back in spring to finish. 

Come spring she is staying at my place a lot (I work remote) and she would leave Tuesday and Thursday for 3 hours to go to college campus.

I have her location and would ask if she made it okay (she would take my car) and she would tell me details about classes and how she is taking a quiz.. etc.

Come this semester while helping her sign up for classes I found out she never went to class in fall. She never even registered for a class. She had been place on probation last fall and was supposed to go a community college.


AITA for wanting to know why she did this?
We’ve been dating for almost a year now I just found out she was lying to me for 4 months.

On top of that her location would sometimes pause while at school campus for a few hours.
She says she would just sit in the car for 3 hours and be on her phone.  In my head I think she was cheating but I have no proof.

When I first confronted her she would gaslight me into other fights and almost try to breakup with me before I got the truth.
She even photo shopped emails to show me she was in class.

I still love her I just never been lied to to such an extreme before.

In her defense she says she was embarrassed about the school probation period and didn’t want me to know or judge her. Her parents are also really strict and she didn’t want them to find out through me and says she had to keep the charade up.

It’s really hurtful and I have been wanting to go through her phone to see what she was really
Up to at that time.

What should I do?
I feel like it’s a huge lie and it’s really Hard to Forgive and trust her again

26,1ge66qn,AITA for picking up the dog poop bag on my way back?,"I do pet sitting/dog walking as my side hustle. I have a few regular clients whose dogs I walk every day. One of my daily dogs lives in a cul-de-sac at the end of a fairly long street in a relatively rural area surrounded by woods. When I walk the dog, I start by walking up the street, and end by walking down the same street. There is no other path. 

Sometimes if the dog poops early in the walk, I will leave the tied off bag next to the stop sign to grab on my way back so I don’t have to carry around poop for 25 mins. It’s a bright green biodegradable bag, and I always leave it in the same spot so I don’t miss it, the bag is there for 30 mins MAX. This doesn’t even happen that often, MAYBE once a week. I thought this was fine; but I was talking to a fellow pet sitter and she freaked out on me and called me as asshole, INSISTING that I would be fined and lose my business. (???) I talked about it with my spouse later, and he agreed that i should probably quit the habit. 

So, AITA for leaving a bag of dog poop by a stop sign and picking it up later? 

Edit: I accept that this is asshole behavior and I will refrain from doing this in the future. I got the idea from the owner herself, I had mentioned that the weird biodegradable cornstarch poop bags she insists on using tear super easily so she told me she leaves the bag and grabs it in the way back when she walks the dog on the weekends. But, I see now that it’s different for me as the dog walker than it is for the dog owner, so I will not repeat this asshole behavior again. Thanks for your input!

He'd often take your things if you wronged him & you'd be forced to apologise or if you say no he'll keep on and on until you cave.

Yes but he'd need to collect car by Wednesday. I wouldn't be able to give him a lift to my house to pick it up due to work & personal commitments. He ignored this and kept saying about me picking him up, why couldn't I do Wednesday. Told him I was busy.
He then tells me how he never asks for anything. How he's done so much for me. I said it wasn't my fault he can't get a bus and it wasn't my fault I can't just drop things for him.
He said how selfish I was, how he'd done everything for me but every time he asked for a favour I threw it back at him and he said how selfish I was (plus several choice names and swearing). 
I said expecting people to drop things for you with zero notice was the definition of selfish.
He called my family telling them how selfish I am and how he does everything. As he's organising Christmas this year I'm banned from that too.

Hi! This is an account I made on the fly because I don’t really know where else to send this too. Anyway, my parents and I have always had issues. 
I (18F) have been seeing a guy (19M) and we’ve gotten pretty close over to course of a month or so. I have met his sister and somewhat met his parents over the phone. 
My parents have been strict, and I get it is for my safety and so on. But I’m sorta getting tired of it. Here is a list I can’t do:
1. Bring my phone into my room anytime during the day
2. Have to go to bed at 9:30 or whenever my dad feels like it
3. I can’t show my croptops to my parents since my mom especially finds me a “wannabe slt”
4. I can’t go out without telling my parents who I’m going with and where I am going. (I get this one but just putting it out there)
5. Not allowed to have socials
6. I haven’t asked but since I was 16 I wasn’t allowed to date.

Now some of these make sense, but lately they have been going through my phone and being more protective. All I want is to date in peace and not get yelled at. I have always had a hard time with my parents yelling or calling me names. I’m not sure what to do or what else to type. Please ask questions and maybe some advice…. 

I also acknowledge that I do live under their roof.

6. I haven’t asked but since I was 16 I wasn’t allowed to date.

Now some of these make sense, but lately they have been going through my phone and being more protective. All I want is to date in peace and not get yelled at. I have always had a hard time with my parents yelling or calling me names. I’m not sure what to do or what else to type. Please ask questions and maybe some advice…. 

I also acknowledge that I do live under their roof. I’m not sure how to address it to them because I’m really scared they will just say no and I have to tell my boyfriend I’m no longer allowed to see him. I’m looking more for advice then just “Am I the asshole” if that’s okay.",3.0,0.013742941,0,0
32,1ge4je0,AITA for not agreeing to my sister's Christmas plans? ,"
I (26f) have 4 siblings (2 brothers, 2 sisters). They now all have children and I am the only sibling that does not. Each year for Christmas, we all buy every child (8 kids) a present each from our own budget, and do Secret Santa amongst us siblings and include our parents.

We keep the Secret Santa budget to €50. It's not about the quality of the presents, it's just for us all to get to open a present each on Christmas morning. It has been our family tradition for years.

My oldest sister (37f) has 2 kids and is currently pregnant, due her 3rd baby before Christmas. Usually this time of the year, we pick our Secret Santa names but my sister said she doesn't want to do it this year as she is not able to afford it, which I thought was totally understandable.

What I have a problem with is she doesn't want any of us to do it. She wants us to get each kid a €20 toy shop voucher and to just buy my parents a present as a gesture for all the babysitting they do during the year. 

Although I know her idea comes from a good place, I still don't see the point in it. It might seem selfish but I know I will miss opening up a present Christmas morning. I do appreciate my parents, but I know it will put them in an awkward position as they would usually only have to get one person a present, but now they will feel like they have to get us all a present.

My mother's birthday is 5 days after Christmas and she usually gets presents anyways from all of us.

I think that spending €20 on each child isnt too expensive, but I find it deflating as they don't even appreciate the presents. Past years, they get so much from Santa and everyone else that my presents are just thrown in the corner. I would rather spend my money on someone who would genuinely appreciate what I got them.

I tried telling her that I didn't think it was a good idea and she told me that my point was selfish, Christmas is just about children and I will never understand until I have my own.

Am I being selfish by wanting to do Secret Santa and not agreeing with her that Christmas isn't always about children? ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-28,"AITA for not agreeing to my sister's Christmas plans?

35,1ge49bx,AITA for shouting at my housemate and his new girlfriend during their obnoxiously loud sex?,"**Context:**

I (25M) rent a room in a house and have lived here for 2 years. My housemate (25M, who owns the house) was my best friend since school but I would say our friendship has deteriorated over this time.

To be polite, I think my housemate has a lot of growing up to do. He is negligent in looking after his house, rarely cleans or tidies, does the bare minimum for a rescued cat we took in, and the garden is an overgrown wasteland of weeds. His job has an odd shift pattern but on days off he just goes to his parents' house and takes his laundry with him. He stopped asking to hang out a long while ago, so I don't spend any quality time with him anymore despite living in his house. He still goes to see other friends or invites them over so I feel he has neglected our friendship entirely.

I have been with my boyfriend for a year and a half and we have never done anything like what I am about to describe. He has witnessed this as the sound comes through on video call.

**Conflict:**

About a month ago, housemate brings a new girl to the house. He says they've been on a few dates and it's been going well, so I congratulate him. I stay out of their way as it's the early days and they want to have dinner and watch TV or a film together, much like my boyfriend and I do, all good.

Then the sex starts. This girl is an absolute screamer. I am talking moans to out-do even the most over-eager pornstar. Cat yowling, tortoise sex, donkey roars, dying child. All good comparisons. They were doing it past 2am which kept me AND the neighbour's dog awake (it started barking. The houses are terraced so the walls are connected to the neighbours too). I manage to get to sleep, but am startled awake 5 hours later when the moans pierce through the walls and shatter my dream state.

I spoke to my housemate after the girl left, jovially explained I heard everything, tried to make light of the situation. I can overlook a one-off or even two-off if it was an errant good night for him. He's also had other girls over without any problems. He loosely apologised but then said ""I can't promise it won't happen again because it probably will"". The next time he said she was coming over, I more seriously asked in passing if they could keep it down and was met with a sarcastic ""No"". The situation still continued. Screaming at night, screaming in the morning.

Last night was the 12th occurrence by my count, and I snapped. I shouted through their door ""Could you please shut the fuck up? Thank you"". They stopped, and I think she asked to be taken home as they fled the house soon after. It's now the day after and I haven't spoken to my housemate but I would appreciate an apology and acknowledgement it will stop. I tried being diplomatic, but it seems like he hasn't bothered bringing it up with this girl, so I don't think I had a choice other than the nuclear option. It was driving me crazy, and honestly, I don't feel bad in the slightest. I live here, I can reasonably expect some peace.

36,1ge3zjb,AITA because my dirty co-worker got fired after I stopped giving him a ride to work?,"

So, I’ve been getting some flak at work because a well-liked co-worker of ours got fired for repeated absences after I stopped giving him a ride to work.

As background, I’m an Active Duty Military mid-level healthcare provider and he was an entry level civilian contractor. We both worked at a large Military Hospital.

Earlier this year, “John [20m],” who recently started working at the hospital, was asking around our department for people he could carpool with. Everyone gave various reasons why they couldn’t help, and eventually I volunteered because he lived nearby and it wouldn’t be out of my way to pick him up.

(I will preface this by noting John was very well liked in our department with most of the older ladies adopting him as their “work son” etc. He’s also the youngest employee by almost a decade.)

This issues started about one month in when I noticed every morning after I picked him up, he would bring various food products to eat on the drive to work. This didn’t bother me at first, but as time went on he was leaving food trash and crumbs in my vehicle. I’m an extremely clean individual, so this bothered me and I said something. He continued eating, and kept forgetting to clean after himself. I was getting tired of constantly reminding him to take his trash with him, and I started just throwing the trash away myself. After doing this a few times, I decided to just leave the trash, and see if he would notice.

He didn’t. For weeks the empty water bottles, redbull cans, candy wrappers and empty containers started to pile up in by passenger door and floorboard, and stayed until I asked him politely “could you take that trash with you?” His response of “yeah of course, I don’t mind” made me feel like he thought it was MINE and I was asking for a favor. 

There’s more examples, but to keep things short, I gave him an ultimatum, he needed to clean up after himself and respect my car, or he would need to find another ride to work.

Not even a week later, he was eating some type of meal with flaky crackers and it was spilling on his lap the entire ride to work. When we pulled into the parking garage, he dusted all the food crumbs from his lap onto my carpet. We left the car and went to work. After work, when I returned to my car, there were ants inside of my vehicle.

I had enough. So I made up an excuse, and told him I couldn’t give him rides.

He took it well, and the rides stopped. But over the next few weeks, his tardiness started to pile up. His agency fired him in September. We are not privy to contractors personnel issues, but everyone assumes he was fired for being chronically late.

Fast forward to today, while on break, I overheard some folks saying he was fired because I stopped giving him a ride to work and that was selfish of me etc. I never told anyone except him why I stopped, and I’m assuming he told them some half baked truth and because he was well liked, I know they believe him.

After i denied that, i still felt like they didn’t believe me, and i was right. Kim started acting extremely rude and immature towards me, always looking at me badly, replying to me rudely and stuff like that. while Anna just kept to herself and mostly ignored me. Here is where i think i messed up. me and kim both get the same train to come to school, at 7:00 am, and i always woke up earlier to get it with her. and now that she started acting all entitled with me, i started getting a later one, now also waking up later and sleeping more. i’ve tried talking with her but she keeps insisting that she isn’t mad with me and stuff like that, but i know she has been talking shit about me. what should i do?",0.0,0.056665175,0,1
39,1ge3p3x,AITA for telling my step-grandfather it's not my job to help him with my dad?,"My step-grandfather ""Tom"" is my dad's stepfather, but dad calls Tom his mom's husband. My dad does not like Tom and does not have a good relationship with him. According to dad's cousins and aunts and uncles, my dad and his two siblings never liked Tom and never wanted much to do with him. Tom married my grandma after my grandpa died. My dad was 8 when his dad died, his siblings were 4 and 5. My dad was maybe 10 or 11 when my grandma and Tom got married. I don't know the exact age. I know my dad feels like Tom had no respect for his dad's place in his life and wanted to take over everything. He never told me but I have heard him talk about it before.

With my dad and his siblings being adults now they have a really minimal relationship with Tom. They still speak to grandma but we don't see her often either because she wants Tom to be included and they don't want to see him. But she also doesn't want to lose out on her kids or grandkids.

My dad let me and my siblings call Tom our ""step-grandfather"" vs grandma's husband. But we'd call him Tom to his face not grandpa.

My aunt has her kids say grandma's husband and Tom.

My uncle has his kids just use Tom and he has no role/title for them at all.

Me and my siblings see him and grandma the most, but not a lot either. But now that I'm older (oldest grandkid overall) I see them a little more often. Or I did. I stopped going as much because Tom wanted me to help him with dad and he wanted me to act as like a go between and to ask dad to accept Tom. He wouldn't stop asking me when I'd see him and grandma and I did ask several times. I told him I didn't want to be used in their issues but he said dad loves me and I could be the person who helps bridge the gap. He said he's tired of being Tom to all of us and he wants to be dad and grandpa. He told me my dad was the ringleader and the reason my aunt and uncle never liked him. He said if he can get through to dad they'll follow along. I said no so many times. Then I stopped going. Tom called me and asked where my visits went and had I asked dad for him yet. I told him it wasn't my job to help him with dad. He lectured me about respecting my elders enough to help them.

40,1ge3net,AITA for yelling  at my parents for referring to my decease daughter as just my step daughter ,"I met my now wife 15 years ago, she had an almost 1 year old daughter. I'll refer to her as “Kate”. Being a dad  was something I always wanted plus my wife is such a great mother I fell in love with her and Kate very quickly. Kate became my daughter, her bio dad wasn't involved. So Ive been the one helping with homework, at every gymnastics meet, giving advice when needed, at doctors appointments, etc, etc. I've never been a stepdad only a dad to Kate. 


I haven't had a good relationship in years with my parents. I have been in basically no contact with them for about 12 years. The only contact has been just with me and not my family and only via phone calls. That's only about once a year though around the holidays.  After they decided having  biological children was far more important for me than my already daughter kate. 

Kate passed away a month ago. It was very unexpected, it has turned my whole family’s world upside down. Whole family is in grief therapy and we are just taking things one step at a time. 

A week ago I got a phone call from my parents saying they heard from other relatives of mine about kate passing. Was wondering how I was doing and I ended up being really vulnerable sharing how difficult it has been for me and the rest of my family since kate passed away. My mom ended up saying at least I still have my biological children and Kate’s just my step daughter. I yelled at them to not refer to Kate as “just my step daughter” and I'm her dad in every way that matters because I have been there for her and love her so much. My dad called me an AH for yelling at them when they were just trying to help me feel better. My wife understands why I got mad but was wondering If I could have been a little more understanding because we have learned some people have a weird way of trying to  support when a person is grieving.

41,1ge3nea,AITA for suggesting we reschedule my birthday plans to help my boyfriend with his project?,"Yesterday was my birthday (well, the day I, F33, and my boyfriend, M39, set aside to celebrate since we’re both working on my actual day). The day before, he admitted he was in a bad headspace, feeling down about a work project—a YouTube channel he’s trying to launch. He filmed the first video, hated it, and asked about our plans, seeming like he was hoping to have time to work on it.

I suggested we reschedule our plans and take the day to work on the video instead. I know he can get fixated when stressed, so I thought working on it might help him relax and enjoy the day more. But he got upset, saying that I “always make things about me” and that we weren’t canceling my birthday to work on his video. I explained I was just trying to help, but he shut down and got defensive, saying he didn’t want to talk about the plans. The conversation got heated, and he eventually yelled and told me to leave him alone.

The next morning, I apologized, saying I should’ve been more understanding and given him time to unwind before bringing up the plans. I also admitted birthdays are emotional for me because I tend to see them as a time when people show you how much you matter (I know that’s not totally rational). But he was distant and even mocked my feelings a bit, saying I was making things all about me. Still, he said he wanted to go ahead with our plans.

The day itself felt tense. We went to a Halloween town, but he barely spoke, walked behind me, and didn’t join me in the shops. I tried to check in, but he gave me short replies and insisted everything was fine. I cried quietly in the car on the way home, feeling hurt and confused.

When we got home, I thanked him for lunch and coffee, then went outside to smoke. Normally, he’d join me, but he stayed inside. When I asked him to hang out, he said he didn’t think it’d be a good idea with me being stoned and him sober, so I offered to sober up. He said he’d come out “in a while,” but he never did.

Later that night, I tried to explain my perspective over the past two days, wanting to understand where we went wrong. He said I was blaming him and not taking responsibility, and that our relationship felt broken. He ended by saying he doesn’t know how to fix things, then went to bed. I stayed up, cried, ate ice cream, and watched *Hocus Pocus* until I fell asleep.

42,1ge3eim,AITA for not helping my husband get ready for work in the morning?,"I (25F) have been married to my husband (25M) for 4 years now. We have a child so it limits our schedule a lot. 

Here's how our mornings used to go 4 months ago : I would wake up around 6am, get ready and go to work by 645am. Husband would wake up when our 2 year old woke up. Usually around 645 to 7am, then gets ready and takes child to daycare. It worked for a bit but my husband hated the schedule (Couldn't be helped, I was required to be in at 7am for work).

After some back and forth, I applied for a part time position at work/ basically gave then 2 months heads up that I'm quitting (husband doesnt want me to work anymore and i dont mind because it was his decision that i worked in the first place) and now I'm the one who takes child to daycare and my hours are significantly decreased. 

It was great, but husband still woke up same time anyway. Around 630 to 7am. I told him that I am quitting work because he *promised* to wake up earlier instead of me. I started working out in the mornings too, so I wake up by 6am to workout and then take a shower hopefully before child wakes up. 

It took some time but we finally agreed to start waking up 5am *together* and start our day (husband keeps saying he wants to get up  by 5 but he cant if im not getting up). It worked great and honestly I was very happy with it. But apparently my husband doesn't like it??

Today, we woke up at 545am, late because he wanted to sleep in so I'm like fk it, ill sleep in too. Child woke up twice at night and I'm the only one who settles the child at night so I'm tired anyway. 

We wake up, he goes to shower and I go to workout. Child wakes up just as I'm done on the treadmill so I got about 20 minutes of workout in. I hand the child to husband and tell him I'm taking a quick shower. He's pissed. It's 615am. I ask him whats wrong and he goes on a rant that he hoped I would help him get ready. 

I'm confused because I don't usually help make breakfast/ lunch for him unless we have nothing prepared in the fridge for lunch (I prep food before or we have leftovers for lunch) or if I want to make something special for breakfast. Plus we woke up late. So I tell him if he wanted my help, he could have asked. I didn't realize he wanted my help. He gets more worked up and said that he needs to leave earlier and now he's late. 

I went to take a shower and reflected on it but I just can't see his side in this. So when I was done and took the child (it's 6:30am) and he's still upset, I ask him why he's upset with me. He again, says that I should have helped him with breakfast so he could have left earlier. I just told him that if he wants my help, to ask me next time and he left for work in a huff. 

AITA in this situation? I'm just so confused 😭 

Edit to add: I forgot to mention that when he first told me that he hoped I would wake up earlier, he also said that he's upset that I waited until 545 to wake up. That I should have woken up earlier?? I told him that's not fair because I wake up with the child at night.

AND! When I missed out on working out for almost a week because of mental health, he said I was getting lazy so I have no idea what this man wants from me 🥲

today is my best friends birthday — we’ll call them Sarah, my other friend we’ll call Hannah —  and i f(20) have decided that i’m not going to be wishing Sarah f(20) a happy birthday. my birthday was 3 days ago and she never told me happy birthday. we’ve been best friends for almost 10 years and she has never once missed saying it to me.

recently we’ve stopped talking — Sarah’s choice — because of a job. she offered to recommend me for a job at her workplace because I needed money for college. it was an under the table paying job, and i was delivering pizza’s. i loved the job, it was super fun, but i was also in college at the time doing a summer semester. i was starting to fail my classes because i had no time since i was working 3 part time jobs trying to pay for my summer semester. i decided i need to leave at least 2 out of the 3 jobs.

i was only there 2 weeks before i had to quit. i asked Sarah if she thought they could hold my spot for me while i finished the semester — kind of like when other college kids have to take a break from work to go back to school. she told me that i couldn’t do that and i would be replaced. i needed time to respond to her because her text most definitely came off as aggressive and defensive. i texted her later in the day, then she texted me the day after and it took me a few days to respond as i have adhd and get easily distracted with things and tend to forget to text people back. she sent another message asking why i was mad at her, and i replied with a huge text letting her know that i wasn’t mad at her and explained how she made me feel. i apologized and everything and she didn’t text me back. so after a few days i asked if she saw my message, and all i got from her was, “yeah”. so, i said, “okay” and we haven’t talked since july.

my other best friend, Hannah f(21), who Sarah is also friends with — we were a trio — texted me later in the day saying “sorry for texting you happy birthday so late”, BUT this morning i saw on her snap story that she made a huge collage of her and Sarah, wishing Sarah a big happy birthday. 

we’ve been a trio for almost 4 years and they’ve ALWAYS favored each other over me, and Sarah and i have only known Hannah for 4 years!!

not to mention, Sarah & Hannah had a HUGE falling out recently because Sarah was in a domestically abusive relationship and Hannah was tired of hearing about it, so she stopped talking to her. both Sarah & Hannah were good with me at that time and they both were talking so much shit about each other. then, we took a trip to a thrift store — Hannah was using Sarah to get a free ride there but Sarah didn’t know that — and then after this trip, they were all fine and dandy again (ughhh)

so, in conclusion, AITA for not wishing my best friend (Sarah) a happy birthday?

44,1ge2ujt,AITA for outing my brother?,"Some background: my brother(19) Dave and I (34)  have a 15 year age gap because of that and crappy parents I took on more of a parental role than a sibling role. About 6 years ago I moved across the county. My brother came out as trans about 4 years ago. Our mother has become a huge bigot and is refusing to use Dave's LEGAL name or pronouns and does not believe trans people exists.

Current situation:  After graduating last year my brother decided to move in with me. I have been put in the middle of the issue between my brother and our mother for the last few years and over that time I have asked for advice from my close friends. At the time I never considered talking to my friends as outing my brother and realistically I talk about him a lot so when I started using his new name and pronouns it was clear what the situation was. 

Now that he has moved here I am realizing I outed this poor kid to my entire circle without his permission. He calls me aggressively an ally and has made it clear that he doesn't think I did anything wrong or harmful but I'm not so sure. 

He is not on hormone therapy and has not had any gender affirming procedures. He has said that my friends would know he is trans as he is not passing so its not a big deal but I genuinely feel like I took some of his autonomy away by not allowing him the space to disclose when and how he wants to. 

My brother is a beautiful human being and I know he would never hold this against me but I also know he lost the opportunity to navigate this as an adult on his own term on his first adulting experience.

46,1ge2ra9,AITA because I asked my GF for help/advice?,"Throwaway account … I‘m actually embarrassed by the whole situation.
And I apologize for all grammar/spelling mistakes.

This has happened a while ago, but it still eats away at me inside.
I (M45) got together with someone (F44) I was in a relationship many years before.
A lot had happened in our live since then, we live completely different lives in different countries.

She is not primarily a screenwriter, but tries to work more in that area (written one short movie that was produced up till now).
As she showed interest diving into it more, I looked up workshops/education/training she might like to attend when visiting me (I live in a big city, she rather rural).
She pointed out the ones I found weren’t suitable for her (and she was right), but encouraged me to attend a specific one of them myself.

It was a very basic workshop, but I really enjoyed the experience. I got some great feedback from the instructor.
I also loved that I could show more interest in her life, as now I could talk about her great passion and have a glimpse of insight.

Here’s where things got out of hand.
I asked, if she might be willing to read over my script (it was just single scenes) and maybe give me some advice or tips about how to get better. Hell broke loose.
I’ll try to quote without exaggeration 

“You are such an impudent and rude AH! Are you seriously asking this? I’m a professional, I payed for my education! And you think, you can just come and ask someone like me to give advice to someone like you?
This just shows what kind of inconsiderate person you are who only thinks about themselves. You have absolutely no respect for me.”

I don’t remember my reaction, but I assume it was a mix of disbelief/shock and the day turned into a long me apologizing and justifying myself.
Most likely I also got angry at some points as I felt attacked unjustified.

I brought it up several times afterwards, but she keeps insisting that I was a complete AH here.

I just can’t see it. It does not make sense to me at all.
But goddamn, there is serious doubt in me.
Am I just being ignorant for not seeing it??


Edit: this might be quite important to show her point of view:
She has been struggling work wise, as there just isn‘t enough work in her area (and it‘s not paid well). So her work/knowledge is pretty much everything she has.
I on the other hands do not have any financial problems at all and can attend such a workshop without much thought about anything (I basically did it for fun).

47,1ge2q9u,AITA for not immediately changing my language terminology to suit my daughter's wishes..,"I have a wife (Dhanyasri), 2 daughters (Kamakshi Devi and Chandrakanta) and a son (Phunsukh Wangdu).

When I talk to wife about the kids and I am referring to something that only applies to daughters I have always referred to them as the girls.

However often I am having to talk to my father and relatives about my family and when I need to tell them something that only applies to my wife and daughters I will often refer to them as the females. This is because in my language usually we don't really refer to our partner as husband or wife in conversation and usually use their names. Since their names combined are very long it is much easier to say that way. As I have only one son, I just refer to him by his short name Phunsukh.

They never had a problem with this and I have been doing it this way for years.

However recently when I was telling my father about how the females in my family all have similar characters, Kamakshi Devi told me she would rather be referred to by name and said something about one of her school friends telling her that saying female is a bad word. I don't understand how this makes sense but I agreed to do so.

However since I am so used to it, I have slipped many times and continued saying it. Kamakshi Devi got upset at me for this and now she has convinced Chandrakanta as well that this is a bad word. Obviously I want to please them and not say it but it takes time for habit to change. Even Phunsukh Wangdu agrees with me and says if it were the other way and he had a brother he wouldn't mind.

51,1ge1suu,AITA for refusing to take classes after I retire (which would help save on health insurance)?,"BACKGROUND:  
My wife (F,56) and I (M,55) have been married since 2000, with once child (in college now). Solid, happy marriage. I'm a middle manager-type and was making about $135k/yr until two years ago, when the company for which I worked was bought and I got a nice payout. I had been miserable in that job for a long time and had worked very, very hard, so I quit. I've been working as a consultant fairly successfully ever since, but I still hate what I do. 

My wife left her job after our son was born in 2002 (her choice) and has been freelancing for the last 15 years or so. I've told her repeatedly that she doesn't have to work if she doesn't want to -- she has health issues and fatigue is a huge problem for her, plus we're solid financially. But she has always wanted to contribute to our income, so she takes work when she can. She's often lamented that she wished she could do more. Regardless, I've brought in about 85% - 90% of the household income since we married.

ISSUE:  
When I quit my job in 2022, we lost my employer health insurance. We found out that if one of us took a class through a local college -- just one class a year --  we could get insurance through the college that was good coverage for less than Marketplace insurance. So my wife enrolled and is taking a class. That's how we've gotten insurance in 2024.

Now... We recently determined that we've saved enough that we can retire early, so I'm stopping work at the end of 2024. I am ecstatic about it. But my wife now thinks that since I won't be working next year, I should be the one to take a class so we can continue getting insurance through the college. Her reasoning is that she'll still be working (even though her work is sporadic), so I should be responsible for taking the class. 

AITA for refusing to take classes? I've been carrying most of the load for decades and really don't want to take on new responsibilities, even if it's just taking a class, so soon after finally getting out from under my work responsibilities. Given how she's always said that she wishes she could do more, and this is something she can do, I feel like she should step up and continue taking the classes. And I don't like her assumption that it would simply fall on me now.

B have 3 (12M, 7M, 2F), the oldest and middle have the same disabilities as my older sister's children, and the younger have down syndrome. They are both SAHM, all the children are in the disability programs my country offers but there is not much money left, after all the medical bills of therapy and meds they need. Their husband's have ok jobs, but with the severity of the children's disabilities it is hard to go by. 

On the other hand, I am single, child-free by choice, went to university, totally debt free, have a masters, and work from home in my dream field. Last month I bought my first house.

I invited my family and friends for a house warming this Saturday. I paid for two caretakers to care for their children so they could come. Everything was fine and fun. Until the end of the night, my friends had already gone home, and it was the three of us. They started to talk about me setting down, marrying, and having kids, since I bought a house. I remembered that I didn't want kids. This talk circulated several times. Until they asked me why foi the tenth time. I told them, besides really not wanting to have a child, I love my freedom, I love the life that I already have. Thinking about our family DNA, that is a high chance of having a disabled child, that means more work and sacrificing, I don't want to sacrifice myself. I want to have money for hobbies, to take care of myself, for expensive clothes and hairdressers, to travel, to live and not just survive. I love them, they're great mom's but I don't want to make the sacrifices to be the same, I would be an awful and spiteful mom, and no one deserves that.

Now my mom and other siblings are calling me selfish and guilt tripping me about not wanting to go the family dinner.

54,1ge1n55,"AITA for not answering the phone to my stepsister, calling her back or letting her stay when she needed a place to stay for the night?","This happened last weekend. Got three random texts in a row and then a phone call that was a number I (23m) didn't recognize. Didn't answer and read through the texts. Found out it was my stepsister (24f). Her car broke down, she was about 30 minutes from my place and her dad and my mom told her she could spend the night at my place and that I ""needed to come pick her up"". She called me again and I still didn't answer and I ignored her texts.

The next morning all hell broke loose. My mom called me a bunch of times and her husband was texting insults repeatedly at me. My mom asked me why I hadn't answered my phone or gone to pick my stepsister up. I told her I wasn't asked I was told and I do not welcome people in who I have a bad relationship with.

To sum up our relationship. We knew each other from kindergarten. We didn't start out a steps but as kids in the same school. By the time we were about 7 we had a very tense relationship. I don't know what started it but we fought a lot and it only got worse whenever we were put in the same class. My mom met her dad through the school calling them up and saying hey we need to talk about your kids, they fight a lot. Through that they started to like each other and began dating when we were 9ish. They got married 8 months later. Our dislike for each other did not change because we were supposedly family at that point. We went to therapy together and her dad sent us to this bonding camp thing where we had to do challenges each day for like a month in the hopes we would work together. I ended up with a dislocated shoulder from that because she refused to take part in one part of it and I fell. My mom put her foot down about it being the end of that. But we didn't even tolerate each other. It was either outright avoid and if we couldn't, there was tension, we glared.

We have not been in the same room since she moved out of my mom and her dad's house and went to live with a friend. 18 months ago I was in a pretty bad accident and spent some time in the hospital. No concern shown. She didn't call to find out how I was or come to see me. Did I care? No. But this is a point I will make because of the big deal about her staying at my place. We do not help each other or care what happens to each other and that's how it is on both sides, not just me. She had to get my number off my mom last week. She did not have it already.

Because I didn't answer or let her stay I was told I'm now a shitty, awful person and my mom's husband has asked repeatedly how I could do that to my ""sister"". My response to him was where was she when I was in the hospital. That was ignored. My stepsister ended up waiting in a coffee shop for her dad to make the 6 hour drive to her.

Adding extra detail I forgot in the main post: The texts/calls started at 10pm. Her car had broken down and she'd left a really shitty date and couldn't get a place to stay because everywhere was very busy because of two events going on. I found this out later.

55,1ge1l3v,AITA for refusing to let my parents see my children?,"I love my mom and dad to bits, but i can’t put up with my moms behavior anymore. 

My mom and dad live down the road to me and my family, which has come in handy many times. But about a month ago, my mom started expressing really weird behaviour. She would kick off for no reason during family outings or dinners, and constantly made a scene when she didn’t get her way.

Every wednesday my parents would join us for dinner, but me and my wife slowly began dreading it, not knowing what chaos was due to happen. This one wednesday, we was all sat around the table enjoying our dinner when my mom excused herself to go to the toilet. I didn’t even realise, but my wife picked up on the fact she didn’t hear the stairs creak. We don’t have a downstairs toilet in our house, so me and my wife immediately got concerned. Me and my wife excused ourselves, and began to look for my mom. We walked into the kitchen, to see my mom with her fcking head in the oven. (i am aware this sounds very similar to that one episode from shameless) We shut our kids in the living room, my dad phones an an ambulance while me and my wife get my mom laid on the floor.

While at the hospital, it was then that my dad told me and my wife my mom had been physically abusing him the past couple weeks. My mom got placed into a mental hospital, and got discharged last week after being in there for a month or so.

Me and my wife decided it’s not a good idea for my mom to see the kids for the time being, but that also means my dad wont be able to. My mom simply wont let my dad go anywhere without her, and never leaves his side. Me and my wife sat them down, and explained they can’t see the kids for a while. My mom went absolutely mental, storming upstairs in a rage. But my dad knew it’s for the best, knowing number 1 it’s not possible for him to see the kids without her as she’s always there, and number 2 god knows what she’d do if she knew he could see his grandkids while she couldn’t.

I can’t help but feel guilty, my children constantly ask when they can see them, and they only have one set of grandparents. I also don’t think it’s fair on my dad, but i don’t know how else to go about it. please lmk if there’s anything i need to handle differently.

We got along very well, he seems lovely and he knew some people at a school all my friends went to. I asked my friends if they knew him and they said he was an arsehole, I won't say the actual rumour because that's private. I was very shocked to hear this as he seems so lovely and I told a friend about it and we were both like that's crazy and we assumed it's fine because he probably changed. Already mean. I knew these two girls there. I was thinking about Brad because the rumours were bad and one of the girls knew Brad's girlfriend. To the girl, I asked on the beach 'Do you know the drama about Brad?' as I thought they knew and would tell me it's not true as I was shocked. The girl didn't know and asked what it was, and on the second time I told her what the rumour was.

I told them I felt bad saying it after and apologised after for telling them and I realised the girl may go tell Brad and I was cooked. They didn't know about the rumour so when they asked me if I knew it was true, I was kind of shocked they didn't know so I said its true then because a friend told me. I should never have mentioned any of this stuff and later, I asked one girl if they told Tom and said I felt awful for mentioning it. I later told a friend (Janice) who knew the girls that I felt guilty telling the girls (Emily and Denise) because they probably told Tom and its not nice. In doing that, I essentially told Janice the rumour too. Emily was the girl who knew the gf and she did tell me it was untrue but since they didn't know the rumour, I wasn't sure as a close friend told me. 2 days later, Emily pulls me aside with Denise and asked me why I told Janice that Emily told me the rumour. I didn't say that but by texting Janice on the phone it twisted itself this way. I tried to explain that wasn't true but as they don't know me and know Janice, they believed her.

I tried to explain I had no malicious intentions and said I'm really sorry for mentioning it and that I didn't say that about Emily. Then, Brad's gf messaged me and asked me about it and I apologised to her but I also said that if Emily didn't ask me twice about it, I wouldn't have said anything, i j wanted to know truth. This led to Denise messaging me on behalf of Emily, saying I was implicating her and Emily and I tried to explain my intentions which she did not believe as Janice told her a different story and she believed if I actually felt guilty, I wouldn't have said the rumour to Janice, which makes sense to say, but I just made a mistake.

During the last two years (2022, 2023), I had a 'rogue teenager' patch, where I was also dealing with clinical depression. She is very firm in her asian parenting style and it tends to clash with my upbringing in a western country, and also, my dad (m67)'s parenting style. During my 'rouge teenager' patch, I had a boyfriend, and I pierced my own ear, but I mostly kept to myself.

In response to my boyfriend, she called me a 'slut' and a 'whore' while I was at an overseas competition. I cried so loud in my hotel room, members of my team in different rooms told the chaperones that they should check on me. When they did, I told them what was happening, and my mum, of course, found out. She said she 'hoped CPS would take me away' and that she 'wasnt my mum anymore; biologically yes though unfortunately"". 

I accidentally came across text messages with her coworker, where she said that 'she wished she never had a child' and later, 'I hate daughters, I wish I had a son instead'. It hurt me alot but my dad said all parents say that so I tried to let it go. 

Then, at my lowest (mentally), I tried opening up to her and in response, she told me I was the reason she was depressed and that I gave her such 'PTSD' that she will never be the same, that I permanently traumatised her. She also often called me fat during this time, and complained to my dad that my thighs were disgusting. So I turned to my dad, and he wasn't happy with her, so she told me that I was 'trying to get them to divorce'. My parents are constantly fighting at the moment, and they live almost separately to the point where all my friends just assume that they actually are divorced and I feel it's my fault.

This is only a tiny, tiny amount of examples of the things shes done.

We share a lot of inside jokes and memories, and I was really excited to celebrate my birthday with her. I planned a small party and sent out invites to my closest friends and family, including Emily.

However, Emily recently started dating this guy, Jake (18M), who I can’t stand. He’s rude, makes inappropriate jokes, and just has a really negative vibe. I’ve tried to be polite, but every time I’m around him, it puts me in a bad mood.

A few days before the party, I found out that Emily was planning to bring Jake along.

However, Emily recently started dating this guy, Jake (18M), who I can’t stand. He’s rude, makes inappropriate jokes, and just has a really negative vibe. I’ve tried to be polite, but every time I’m around him, it puts me in a bad mood.

My husband (34F) is from Europe, hardly ever sees his family and because of immigration has only just now been able to travel back home after being stuck in the U.S for 4 years. He is extremely close with his family, so going 4 years without seeing them was destroying him in every way. We also have a daughter (2yrs) and of course want her to be close with cousins, aunts, uncles, etc. 

Last year was the first year he could go back home after the 4 years so we left for Europe and stayed for 3 weeks over Christmas/New Years. It was absolutely incredible and seeing him in his hometown, with his family, was something I’ll never forget. He was himself, he was home.

Now we live 30 minutes away from my parents, so they see us at least once a week. My mom and husband have not gotten along for a year now due to her emotional immaturity and lack of accountability. There’s so much to unpack there but I’ll just try to simplify, she is a recovering ""functional"" (whatever the f***) that means alcoholic. She gets weird sometimes and emotionally aggressive and my dad just follows along. It’s ridiculous and too long to explain but I hope you get the idea. 

Now we plan to go back to Europe again over Christmas to see his family, because he has a huge family and that’s the time of year when everyone can be together. My mom found out about this a month ago and has been absolutely angry and is taking it as I’m choosing them over her, and she feels it’s unfair to miss another Christmas with us again. 

I’m feeling torn, but I’m also feeling agitated that my parents can’t be even a little excited that I get to experience these new and exciting things.

Edit: He has offered to fix/ replace my things. I don’t want to break up over this unless it continues to be a problem.

I 26f and my boyfriend 26m have been together for over a year and living together for 7 months now. He is an amazing and sweet guy, he always tries to do a lot for me and I appreciate him very much. However he is not very careful and doesn’t always think things all the way through. I have high anxiety so I always think in worst case scenarios and decide what to do accordingly. I feel like he doesn’t have any respect for any of my stuff while I am extremely careful with others items. The first instance was when he was helping me move, I have some upholstered chairs that are a tight fit but will fit through the doorway if you maneuver them right. He and his friend were having trouble getting them out of my apartment and I asked them to please be careful, the chair got stuck and I again asked them to be careful. He said “I’m just going to shove it through” at which point I said “please don’t do that, try moving it this way” and I was disregarded and he pushed it as hard as he could and tore the fabric. I was upset especially because I asked him to stop and suggested other ways to get it out that have worked when I moved them and was just not listened to. Another instance was when I had an old kind of beat up desk that I planned on fixing, he decided to use it as a workbench while he was fixing up a room in the house. When I saw that he was using it I was uncomfortable because it was a huge mess and easily scratched and I could tell it was damaged more. I ended up taking all of his stuff off of it and using one of his own things in its place. I told him to please ask before using my things because it had gotten damaged. And then this morning he told me my cat had knocked over my tea kettle and broke it. We had pizza last night and when I went to bed I asked if he wanted help putting the leftovers away and he said no. Unbeknownst to me he had left an empty pizza box out and to deter the cats from messing with it he put my kettle on top of it to keep it closed instead of just throwing the box away. I know he meant well but I feel like there is know complete thought process when it comes to my items being used or touched. It feels like there’s no respect for my things.

66,1ge00q3,AITA for telling my friends daughter it's fine to fake a different personality at school?,"The daughter of a good friend of mine (16 years old) visits my place about 2 times a month to paint miniatures. The hobby tends to take up a lot of space and can be expensive, so to lighten the load on her allowance (And by extension her parents finances) she uses my paints and tools.

It used to be that either her mom or dad would come along, but recently she has been to my place by herself. I was initially uncomfortable at the idea, but we agreed it's fine as long as she gives me advance notice and her parents know where she is. One of the reasons I didn't like the idea at first is that she asks a lot of questions about adult life and such. I consider myself kind of a fuckup, and I was and am still worried that I might be downloading some bad life advice onto her.

A few weeks ago she told me that she pretends to be a different person at school, she's part of the ""popular"" clique and says she fakes a lot of her interests and hobbies, because shes worried being honest will get her flagged as a nerd and potentially bullied. Mini-Painting is one of many things she basically tells nobody in her age-circles about. She has one close friends that knows the ""real"" her, but everybody else basically gets the ""curated for popularity"" version of who she is.

After telling me about it, she asked whether or not she should keep it up. Apparently her dad in particular has been vocal about ""be yourself"" in all situations, and you shouldn't have to fake being a different person at school. I want to stress that I do agree with him in spirit, but as someone who did have a bad school experience, I also know that just being you isn't always easy for teenagers.

So I told her that while its important to find people you can be straightforward with, everybody fakes a public persona to at least some degree. If she feels it keeps the peace and it isn't harming her mentally, it's ultimate up to her how she wants to act at school. Its only another year (Potentially 2) and the people you meet and hang with at school don't have to be the last word on your actual friend circle. I did encourage her to keep a good wire to her one close friend and that some more people she feels can be trusted wouldn't hurt.

A few days later, and repeatedtly since then, I have had arguments with her dad about the whole thing. He says that I effectively told a teenage girl to not be herself and by extension am harming her self-image.

68,1gdyt17,AITAH for donating packages i didnt order.,"Start of October, I came home to 3 large boxes with the same last name addressed to my house. I called my mom to confirm whether we were expecting anything from overseas relatives. When she confirmed we weren't expecting anything, she called the number provided on the packages. They stated they didn't want it and to do whatever I wanted with it and provided no information. The 3 boxes contained misc items like jars of spices and lots of packaged clothes. I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.

In any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done. If this does happen again then I know what to do. I talked to friends after this happened and they said if they were in their shoes they would also be upset if someone donated their items. Am I the asshole?

edit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives. Thank you to everyone for informing me of the potential scam. I had no idea that was a common practice. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-28,"AITAH for donating packages i didnt order.

I wasn't a fan of the clothes so after putting off the donation for 2 weeks, I dropped off the clothes at a donation box. Today, October 27, my mom called asking if I still had the contents of the boxes and my neighbor called her to say it was theirs and they wanted it back. I told her I either donated or tossed everything. During the evening at 9, I return to my house to see a group of 7 people crowding my yard. They demanded to know what happened to their package and that I essentially stole their stuff. If I wasn't expecting a package then I should've left it outside and I had no right to throw their stuff away. The situation was escalating and they were getting very aggressive. I showed them the shipping label that showed my address on the box but their only concern was I stole their stuff. They threatened to give me 1 day to return their stuff or they would pursue legal action. I had called the cop at this point as they were causing a ruckus and yelling. When the cops arrived they talked to us and our neighbor. That neighbor was accusing us of stealing the expensive jewelry in the boxes. The boxes had no such items and looked to be from a dropshipping company.

In any case, I'm starting to question whether I am at fault. Our neighbor confirmed the phone number on the boxes was hers but during the call, they said they wanted our address to pick up the stuff. Since they lied about the content of the boxes I have little reason to believe in what they say. In hindsight, I could've done other things but what's done is done. If this does happen again then I know what to do. I talked to friends after this happened and they said if they were in their shoes they would also be upset if someone donated their items. Am I the asshole?

edit: I realise now the wording is unclear. The last name on the boxes is the same as mine which is why I asked my mom if we were expecting anything from relatives. Thank you to everyone for informing me of the potential scam. I had no idea that was a common practice. ",0.0,1.0081431,1,0
69,1gdy6c3,AITA for not getting up to feed the cat? ,"DISCLAIMER: the cat had food, he just wanted a different food (he had kibble, wanted wet food). 

I (31F) am neurodivergent and have Bipolar. This is relevant for this story because a) social interaction wears me out (regardless of how much I care for the person or how much fun I'm having) and b) my sleep cycles are hard to manage, I struggle to wake up in the middle of a sleep cycle and too little sleep can induce a mania phase. My fiancé (37M) knows and is as supportive as he can be, although it's still a bit confusing for him, which is understandable, since he doesn't know how it feels. 

He, on the other hand, wakes up in a terrible mood. I've never seen anything quite like it, but I ended up getting used to it, I just try not to mess anything up until he wakes up, so that he has nothing to pick a fight about. 

We have a cat. To simplify let's go with Mocha for the cat and Matt for Fiancé. 

Matt works 7 hours while I work 8, so when I was given the option to choose my schedule I asked to clock in at 8am so I could leave at the same time he does (5pm). So I wake up an hour before him, feed Mocha wet food and proceed with my day. 

Sometimes Mocha wakes up at like 5 or 6am and meows for food. Something important is, if I wake up at this time, I either stay up until the end of the day but my performance is null, or I go back to sleep but can't get up on time to work. Today was one of those days, Matt woke me up to feed Mocha because he's on sabbatical and he's using some time to rest and sleep in, and I told him ""give me 5 minutes"". He got up yelling ""it's always me for everything"" (in his defense, he does most of the housework because I used to work freelance after work to make ends meet, and I haven't found a routine yet because I stopped that not long ago), slammed a few doors, fed Mocha, came back for his pillow and went to sleep in the couch. I got stressed out and had trouble falling asleep again, and when I did I missed the alarm and got late for work.

About the social interaction part, we had a friend over for the weekend, plus I have been sick and in pain (UTI and a flare-up of chronic appendicitis), so I was extra exhausted today.

70,1gdxq1h,AITA- my boyfriend doesn’t want me to do my school musical,"Hi! So I (15F) have a huge love of musical theatre and performing arts- since i was 4 it has been my dream to go professional and maybe even get a lead one day and the whole time throughout my life i have been faced with nos and have always felt like im not good enough which really affects my confidence sometimes.

Anyway, this year my school is putting on a production of Oliver jr. and i wanted to go for Nancy as she is the lead female and to be honest she's a really good character to play. Immediately I told my non-actor boyfriend (15M) that i was auditioning for this character, and i was explaining the characters plot line to him and he immediately went 'no' (if you don't know Nancy is romantically involved with abusive Bill Sikes, she eventually gets beaten to death by him) and i asked why he was uncomfortable with it and his answer was 'i don't want to have to watch you act romantically with someone or get beaten as that would be hard for me to watch.' Which i completely understood- i took time with him to work through it and explain it and i thought that there were only younger people going for Bill Sikes which put him slightly at ease which made him say, 'i won't come and watch but i will run through your lines with you if you get it and do what you need me for to support you.' which, with hindsight, was extremely reasonable- but i was still hurt as he is my best friend and partner and i just want to share all my achievements with him, so him not watching felt wrong.

I turned up to auditions, knowing he was prepared for me to get the role- i did, and i got a callback and i was so happy as i never get callbacks or make it this far in the proccess and the idea of playing a lead was slowly within reach but, there was this one boy (16-17M) going for Bill Sikes that I didn't know about and i told my boyfriend and he got so upset because apparently that guy was mean to him and was also older than us and he definitely didn't feel comfortable now with me playing his love interest. (This older guy is basically guaranteed the role- he was by far the best and the oldest which helps for Sikes) He doesn't want me to accept the role (which i still don't know if i got!)

We talked for weeks and I was really invested. Eventually we made plans to meet up and they didn't show so I realized they were fake. We stopped talking. I tried figuring out who i thought it was, contacted the cops who were less then helpful lol. 
Awhile went by and i got over it.

A few weeks later though, they messaged me again- they missed me. Honestly I missed talking to and wasn't that upset after a few weeks of cooling off and kinda want to keep talking. 

We talked a bit, and I eventually got this person to tell me a bit about who they are. I dont even know how I got him to start being honest, but I said I was going to block the number unless I got some true details and eventually he sent me a photo. He told me enough of the truth that I had enough info to look for his wife on Facebook. But I didn't find anything.

Then tonight we were talking and I asked more questions and got the key piece of info to find her online. 

He's asleep and doesn't know yet, but I found her facebook account, his facebook account, his real name, their Instagrams. I figured out where he lives, where he works and I found their wedding video on YouTube where I can hear them talking and know their British lol. 

I genuinely feel friendship feelings and don't plan to ruin his life and his marriage. I'm not evil like that. He also has a daughter. His wife has no idea he is a catfish/romantic scammer. 

I think when he sees my messages tomorrow he's going to be very upset and scared. I have so much dirt on him. But again, I would never ruin his life.

79,1gdvwx9,WIBTA for confronting my friends?,"Disclaimer: These are fake names for privacy.

My friends and I are in the same college year but go to different schools. Their school is known for parties, and mine is small and BYOB. They asked for me to visit them for a weekend so we could party together, which was exciting since I’d never been to an official college party.

Originally, I was going to drive since their school is 2 hours from home, but Kelly insisted they’d drive the 4-hour round trip to get me if I lent her money for gas. However, she took my card to fill up her whole tank and, on the ride, kept complaining about how tired she was from the drive.

Once we got there, I met Kelly’s roommate, Kelsey. She seemed nice, but we didn’t immediately click. We just sat around for hours before getting ready, and when I asked to stop by the store for a new outfit and a contact lens case I’d forgotten, they shot it down, saying they were too tired.

I ended up uncomfortable in my outfit, changing three times, but they seemed annoyed, so I just wore my original choice. While waiting to go out, they all cuddled together on the bed, leaving me to sit on the floor.

At the frat, the fun started (bc I was drunk), but tension remained. I kept getting left while dancing, and they’d have convos of things I obviously wouldn’t get. As the night went on, they got drunker, and I was the only one sober enough to help everyone get home. I held Kelsey up so she could walk, stopped Mia from talking to strangers, and got Kelly off FaceTime with random guys. I spent the whole night apologizing to strangers for their behavior. 

Back at their place, I changed Kelsey into pajamas, charged her phone, blew up the air mattress for Mia, and helped Kelly into bed. Yet, I ended up sleeping on the floor. By the morning, I was upset because the only night the frats were throwing, and it felt like my first time was just sad.

The next morning, I suggested going to the store again, and Mia literally said it wasn’t her problem.  And yes, I slept in my contacts both nights since they refused to go to the store (not good since my eyes are Sahara Desert dry). Now I’m home, glasses on, feeling like I was used for gas and as a babysitter. I want to call them to ask what was up, but I worry it’ll make our friendship awkward.

81,1gdvn0i,AITA for ignoring my bestfriend/cousin?,"
Me,(16f) and my cousin (16f) were at a volleyball game. A guy behind us was talking bad loudly about our team (he’s our classmate). 

Mad at this, I told my cousin (my best friend) that he was talking bad about the team.  I said “I’m just gonna ignore him, he’s just being a ni****”. I’m black and native and my cousin is a Filipina. She then turns to me and says “(my name) you can’t say that you’re only ½ black. I looked at her and I said “what?” She sounded mad and I was shocked by her switch up. I told her how it didn’t make sense for her to tell me (a black person) that it wasn’t okay for me to say something I was allowed to say. I asked her how being only half black made me any less of one.. She said, “I’m just pressed about everyone swearing”. I said “(her name), people are gonna swear. We are in Highschool now, not grade 3”.
She told me she didn’t want me swearing and I told her that she wasn’t my mom and that I could swear if I wanted to. Mind you, she swears too, we both do.

I then get up from the bleachers and move to my other friend. We talk and eventually the game ends and I go home. Later that night though, guilt was tearing me apart. Me and my cousin have been friends since we were babies and we rarely ever had a huge fight. I decided that I was going to text her. I sent her a paragraph on how I was super sorry for arguing with her  and that I was going to improve on not swearing near her and that I loved her.  I wasn’t going to apologize for saying a slur that I could say because it did not affect her.She then leaves me on sent for 10 hours. She continues to talk in our shared groupchat with some other friends. The next day at school I walked up to her.  and say “hey, did u get my message?” She walks away quickly. At this point I thought “we’ll I’ll just not talk to her.. maybe she needs some space?” So I hang out with my other friends. 
Later at 3rd period, one of my friends walks up to me and says “(cousin's name) is crying because your not hanging out with her”. Why would she ignore me at school and want me to hang out with her?  Later, my cousin goes home crying. After school I go home and my mom wants to talk to me.
She says that my cousin told her I was calling her names and being rude to her. Being family and all, my moms now into this mess. I figure out that the name calling was a nickname me and our mutual friend group used.  she got super heated about it and said we were “making fun of her name”. It happened a month ago and was forgotten. I realized that my cousin was telling our moms things that were convenient for her at the moment. I got grounded. I went on my phone 2 hours later and I saw  that my cousin liked my apology.(Instagram reaction) she did not reply,she did not apologize. It was like I was the only  person in the wrong. I apologized  so that we could get over the argument and that we could be  friends.

84,1gdvk97,AITA for getting a boyfriend?,"- Background  -
I (21M) have been playing games all my life and roughly 3ish years ago I started playing games with a consistent group of people on all kinds of games.  Many of them were some of my closest friends especially one, Lenny (21M). 

- Story  -
At the start of 2023 me and a few friends from our group switched to PC gaming after a couple years of playing on console together.  We would play ALL the time with any free time we had and even would make YouTube videos together and all that fun stuff.  

As time goes on me and Lenny get close like near best friend status if that makes sense.  He soon comes out to me as gay which is awesome because I’m also gay and didn’t really have any gay friends that had any of the same interests as me.   But that was when he started acting weird while we were on call, like getting upset when I would talk to people in game, going silent when I didn’t do what he wanted and insulting me when I couldn’t be on the game at all.  But I brushed it off.

We continue to grow closer to the point where we both feel comfortable opening up about our mental health and things get very deep and personal at that point.  But the conversations are strange, he opens up to me but any times I try to open up it wouldn’t get any comment or would be turned into something about him.  I blew it off like whatever it sounds like he has it worse anyway (do not compare struggles, everyone lives different lives and struggles on different levels, treat others with respect).  

Around September of 2023 I get a new job and a boyfriend (21M) that I am very happy with!  But I hold off on telling Lenny about my boyfriend because I feel he may react poorly to it.  As I’m not able to play games as much any more, me and Lenny’s talks about mental health get more and more intense.  To the point where he tells me his plan to do things to himself and how it would be better if he wasn’t around anymore.  

One night it eventually got so bad that I had to call the police to do a wellness check on him (we live far I couldn’t just drive there).  And when the cops leave he is livid with me which I expected.  But in good news as of a week after the wellness check he is making strides to benefit his mental health like opening up to family, going to therapy and discussing medication.

This is when I find out that him lashing out at me and telling me he had plans to do things to himself was because he thought I had a boyfriend and that I wasn’t able to get on anymore.  He had feelings for me I could not reciprocate and instead of accepting that and moving on he tried to claw me down for being happy.  I blew up angrily and eventually blocked him.  It is now nearly November of 2024 and I blocked him around February of 2024 and I am the happiest I’ve ever been.

Or do I stay silent ignoring both the situation and my friend’s feelings? Any advice is much welcome. I will make edits and comments as necessary.",0.0,1.0398175,1,0
86,1gdvak5,WIBTA if i washed my hair?,"for context i’m staying with my (18f) cousin (27f) for the long weekend. my cousin did a beauty course for 8 week before dropping out in 2015. the topic of hair care came up and i showed her the shampoo and conditioner i use, saying i wash my hair everyday. i’ve always washed my hair everyday as thats the way i was brought up, and it works for my hair, as well as the fact when my hair is greasy it’s very overstimulating for me and i can’t concentrate on anything. 

now this is the issue; my cousin told me to not wash my hair the following day, which i didn’t and today i feel so overstimulated and unclean. i said i was going to wash my hair tonight and she got upset saying that she knows best etc, and i tried to explain that i genuinely feel so uncomfortable and unclean. now she’s mad at me and when talking to me has an attitude. i texted our nana about it (i’m a lot closer with her and i live with her), and she said i’m rocking the boat and to just not wash my hair, as she’s more experienced in the beauty community. i have a 7 hour bus ride tomorrow to get back home and i already know if i don’t wash my hair again tonight i’m going to be uncomfortable and i’ll have trouble sleeping tonight. but i also don’t want to rock the boat and create a problem with my cousin and nana by washing my hair.

However she cannot follow the plot of a movie to save her life. Unless it is about a big city lawyer visiting her home town to shut down the local factory but instead reconnecting with her high school boyfriend who is also the local baker and mayor. 

I've known this about her for years and I have accepted it. I just like vegging with her so I am happy to see white people rediscovering the magic of Christmas. Or whatever. 

When we were dating we watched The Matrix. The questions she asked had me wondering about her. Ditto for anything complex. Even The Usual Suspects where they lay everything out for you she didn't get the ending. 

We had her sister and brother-in-law over for a couples night on Friday. We made supper and the plan was to watch a movie. Hee sister wanted to watch Shutter Island. I will not spoil it but the movie has many twists. The ending is awesome. 

I tried my best to suggest anything else. The new Laura Dern movie where she bangs the kid from Hunger Games. They all ganged up on me and said we were watching Shutter Island. 

My wife proceeded to embarrass herself by not understanding the ending and asking questions that were not great. 

Her sister and her husband were looking at my wife like she was Simple Jack. I tried my best to cover for her or telling her I would explain it later. She got mad at me for not just answering her questions. 

After they left she started in in me. She said that she noticed that we always watched a certain kind of movie and that she thought I enjoyed them.  I said I did because we got to spend time together and that mad me happy. 

She said that she was not an idiot and that she just didn't concentrate on movies. She recited the plots of several novels to prove her point. I said that I had never commented on her intelligence and that ahe was smarter than me. She says that I'm a jerk for not watching movies I enjoy with her. 

So I agreed and we watched Memento today. I think her head almost exploded from bot asking questions. I saw her on Wikipedia reading the plot.

89,1gduzvu,AITA for giving the cold shoulder over Bf (19m) who is hosting a party and I’m not invited.,"My bf is hosting a Halloween party in a couple days and I was never invited. He’s been talking about this for a couple weeks now and not once did he ever initiated about inviting me at all. All his friends are going with their SOs. It makes me sad that he invited them but not his own girlfriend. He even said that he wanted to match costumes but I said what’s the point if we’re not together.

Him and his friends mostly consisting of guys and two girls which are dating of the guys in the same friend group have known each other since elementary school. I have met most of them and I’ve met his parents too. I was trying to be chill about it but Idk why its making me so upset. Its gotten to the point that I have unintentionally been giving him the cold shoulder every time he talks about this party. Am I being too controlling or too jealous? 
 
Update: For those saying that if he suggested that we’re matching I should assume I’m invited right away. He agreed with my comment and said “thats true” “I guess I should just match with my other friends”. Thats why I assumed that I’m not invited at all. The reason why I don’t want to ask him directly either is because I want to avoid coming across as too controlling or needy, but it's hard not to feel upset.

Update 2: I just had a conversation with him about the party, and he said he didn’t think to invite me because he thought I’d feel awkward since I’m not close with his friends. I told him I’d like the chance to get to know them better, and he said, “If you say so, you can go if you want.” Hearing that response didn’t help; it felt like he didn’t genuinely want me there. Now, I’m stuck. If I go, I’ll feel like an unwelcome guest, but if I don’t, it could lead to a fight. I’m at a loss for what to do next.

I'm sleeping in my room, and my little sister draggs the kennel of screaming puppies into my room, hits me to wake me up and says ""their your dog's and your responsibility so fix it"". Then slams my door and leaves me with yelling puppies.

I tried to ignore them, then she comes in a second time, hits me again and says ""fix it"" again, so I got up to see what was wrong and they had #2 in the kennel and walked all in it, there was a blanket over their puppy pad also. Take not, these are NOT my dogs. They where my mother's choice to foster, she said they where her responsibility, they have never been my responsibility.

So I picked up the kennel and put it back in my sister's room, found out the puppies had pooped through the kennel bars on her floor, sister gets up runs to mama in tears and all the sudden she's mad at me, we drag the kennel outside, sister gets to go back to sleep, we get out there she starts screaming at me that I'm selfish and self centeted for not fixing it.

I told my little sister to let them out before they go to sleep, I told her to. She did not.

After she says something like ""your sister has to get up in the morning, you do not, your being selfish!"" And I don't think I am? I mean I get not knowing what to do in that situation but she could have asked me for help, if anything I think she should have woke my mother up about this. Not me.

92,1gduu90,WIBTA For pushing to live with my dad fulltime?,"This is a burner account!!!

For some context - I 16f live primarily with my Mom 45f and visit my dad 56m, (50/50 Custody) I also have 2 younger siblings (14f & 13m). 

Anyway, I had a sport thing on Saturday night and over text she made it very clear she was out and wanted nothing to do with it which I didn't mind considering my mom hasn't been there. Which I don't entirely understand. She constantly says that I do not want a relationship with her when that's not true I've begged, pleaded, cried, screamed, yelled, asked nicely, literally everything I can think of to try and make it work but it never seems to do anything. She consistently puts it all of me which I understand The relationship works both ways but I feel like She should still be putting effort into it. Im only 16. So she rarely shows up in person, offers a little emotional, and on top of that almost everything financially for me falls on my dad.

The problem hit when she did show up.

She has a habit of taking really bad pictures and posting them, I had just finished my program and I posed for like 3 pictures, and then im trying to figure out what my team is doing she got all upset and was yelling about something and I kinda snapped at her and was like ""Mom not right now I need to focus on my team and what going on I don't want to take pictures"" and she got upset and was like okay Im leaving than. I was a little annoyed/upset and was just frustrated as to why she came at all. Eventually, I figured out what was going on and walked out into the hallway and my mom was still there, we took some more pictures and then she left. Now I knew she'd probably post something but to say the least they weren't great and people from my school followed her. When I saw them after the show I was naturally upset and called her and asked her to take them down. She then proceeded to snap at me and get upset when she got home that night she yelled at me and was basically like ""IM your mother I can do whatever I want"" Now I might be the A-hole because in response I went ""Are you? because you don't act like it."" and I went to my room, she ended up putting the screen recording on my phone and I have currently been resorting to my laptop.

Here is where my AITA comes into play, I love my mom I do, BUT I only have so long left before I go off to college and I don't want to spend it walking on eggshells miserable and she only ever hurts me more than she helps. She contributes very little and takes a whole lot more. I think living with my dad would be better for me and it's something I would like to do, I've considered it for years and it's not like I haven't been with him full time for longer periods before, and I'm usually always healthier when Im at my dads. I don't want to hurt my mom or to leave my siblings behind to take the brunt of it and I feel like if I push for this and look into this it'll only be a disaster.

94,1gduhp1,AITA in this friend breakup?,"This has been eating away at me all month and I need opinions from people I don't know.

**(CW: extremely brief mention of an ED.) (EDIT: grammatical errors.)

This past week, my friend group, who I will refer to as Marcy, Kendra, and Wendy (just in case they find this), has been divided. Kendra and I are on the same side, while Wendy and Marcy are on their own side. And just for further context, we are all female, and currently in college.

For the past month, Wendy has been avoiding talking and hanging around me, only coming to me when no one else is available. I saw this as her going through some sort of ""mood,"" but became suspicious when Marcy slowly began to distance herself from Kendra and I.

**(CW: extremely brief mention of an ED.) (EDIT: grammatical errors.)

This past week, my friend group, who I will refer to as Marcy, Kendra, and Wendy (just in case they find this), has been divided. Kendra and I are on the same side, while Wendy and Marcy are on their own side. And just for further context, we are all female, and currently in college.

For the past month, Wendy has been avoiding talking and hanging around me, only coming to me when no one else is available. I saw this as her going through some sort of ""mood,"" but became suspicious when Marcy slowly began to distance herself from Kendra and I.

95,1gdugi7,WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my cousin because she possibly made me miss out on making new friends?,"I (F19) and my cousin (F20), let’s call her Mandy, have lived in different cities for most of our lives, up until a year ago when I started attending university in the city she lives in.

We began hanging out and our closeness was rekindled from when we would see each other once a year.

Recently, we went to see a musical in the city together. She invited two of her coworkers which she ran by me beforehand and I was more than okay with it. I was honestly excited to possibly make some new friends since I don’t have a ton in the city I’m currently living in. She painted them as very very chatty people who would talk your ear off, which I was thrilled about because I had hoped that that meant I wouldn’t have to do a ton of talking to engage in conversation and talking to them would be easy.

When we went to the show, we arrived early so we could get a good parking spot. Her coworkers (both guys if that’s important) arrived shortly after. We introduced ourselves to one another and they sat down, making conversation with my Mandy.

They didn’t seem too interested in talking to me but I just caught that it wasn’t the vibe and was chill with it.

The show started and we had a great time. Once the show ended, we parted ways and me and Mandy went to get food and headed back to her place.

We just sat around and chatted for a few hours, when suddenly this conversation took place:

Mandy: I kinda threw you under the bus.

Me: Huh?

Mandy: with my coworkers. I told them that you’re really shy (true) and reserved and that you’d make conversation with them, but you don’t want to talk to them.

Me: oh- huh, what?

Mandy: *laughing the entire time she’s saying this* yeah! Isn’t it so funny? You’ll never see them again!

I stayed silent and laughed along cause I really had no clue what just happened.

She had a vague reason for why she told them that, that being ‘I didn’t want them to be too chatty with you’. Now idk why she would invite them if that were truly the case. She had mentioned that she thinks both of them have a crush on her so I think that had something to do with it.

Once I got home and had time to think about what she said, I was a little hurt by it. Thinking about whether or not they would have talked to me more if she hadn’t said that and if I had missed out on making friends.

But aside from this, she makes a lot of odd comments about my physical features or things I have done in the past (like going on a family trip) or things I have. 

But overall, my cousin doesn’t seem to have much of a filter and it’s really hurtful at times. I don’t know if it’s worth hanging out with her after her doing this.

So, WIBTA if I stopped hanging out with my cousin because she has little to no filter on the things she says?

96,1gdu1nv,"AITA for informing a young man of his rights, allowing him to get away before police arrived to search him? ","
I'm in the UK, and we have what are called 'community support officers' - AKA 'plastic bobbies'. Basically, they look a bit like uniformed police at a glance, they act a bit like real police officers, but they have very little actual power or authority. Don't have handcuffs, or a baton, no powers of arrest, pretty much glorified security. If they see a crime all they can really do is alert the real police. They act as a deterrent I guess, and save money on real police walking around. 

So, as I'm walking through a local estate, I see the local community officer stood with a young lad I recognise as local, who looks pretty nervous. I walk over and ask what's up. The officer informs me they're waiting for the police to arrive as he suspects the lad may have some cannabis on him so they'll be doing a search. I ask him if he's told this lad he has to stay here and wait for them, to which he says yes I've told him he has to wait until the police arrive to conduct a search. So I tell him well you can't hold him here, you know you can't. I turn to the lad and tell him as much, to just leave, now, he can't hold you here, so jog on. He looks a bit unsure, asks if I'm being serious so I say yea, go, quickly now, he's not allowed to hold you here but the police will so leave before they get here. So he does. The community officer and I then have a chat, all friendly, I actually chat with him quite often so we know each other, I've got respect for what they and the police need to do, but I felt like he was keeping the boy there under false pretenses and that's just not on. He tells me I shouldn't have told him he could go, I tell him he shouldn't have not told him. So, given the situation, AITA for letting the lad know his rights, and that he was free to go?

97,1gdtwc5,"AITA, I blocked most of my friends after they stayed friends with someone who said hurtful things.","Basically just the title. So I have a few irl friends, about 10 of us or so. We’re all in a group chat together so that we can still talk if we don’t have time to hang out in person. This one guy in the gc, who we were all friends with, started saying racist things. Like how white people and other races being together doesn’t look good, how he wouldn’t date someone that isn’t the same race as him, that he doesn’t find other races attractive, stuff like that. 


He’s mentioned his preferences a few times in the past but I didn’t say anything about it, because I didn’t want to cause unnecessary drama. But this time I decided to just be like “hey what you’re saying is kinda hurtful (I’m not white and I’m one of the only non-white people) especially since not everyone in this group is white.” Tried explaining to him how it was hurtful. He got angry/sad/embarassed and left the group chat, then got added back, 2 hours later or so. 


A few days later he DM’ed me to apologize. He said he was sorry that I felt that way (in regards to being hurt), that he didn’t think his personal preferences were hurtful and that he thought I don’t always get sensitive like other people, that I shouldn’t take it personally, and that it’s not his fault because his family raised him that way. I personally don’t think that saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” is a real/sincere apology, so I got angry and responded in a not so great way. Basically I said “sure whatever that’s fine just leave me alone, I’m already having a bad day.” Which was true tbh.


Then life went on, like a few weeks or so. One of our friends told me that they tried explaining to him how what he said was wrong, but he got angry again and blocked a few of us. Including me. So they decided to compromise and move on because he’s not going to change his mind. I told them, what he said was hurtful and it’s hurtful that you guys would move on just because he won’t change his mind. That he needs to learn how to accept constructive criticism. They then told me I need to move on from the situation. 


Just three days ago, I left the group chat and blocked most of them because I was frustrated and sad that they took him back, and also what they said. So AITA for blocking these friends or was my action justified? I’m just trying to look for some unbiased opinions, thank you. 


Edit 1: thank you everyone for the responses. It means a lot

edit 2: this is how we got on the topic of racism in the first place: we were talking about school and he was saying there’s only 2 girls in one of his class (he’s in a male dominated area of studies), one of whom he said wears really revealing clothing. he said he wouldn’t wanna date her because of that, which is ok and then he mentioned how she’s coloured too and he doesn’t go for that. so someone asked him to elaborate, he then said how coloured and white peoole don’t mix down in the south and it just looks wrong, it’s better for whites to date only whites, and all the other stuff i mentioned in the post.

98,1gdtrpl,WIBTA if I put a lock on my bathroom door after sis&BIL broke their bathroom and aren't paying to repair it? ,"Sis and BIL live in my finished basement with their toddler. A bathroom was installed downstairs so that we all wouldn't have to share that space. (I have an 8 yr old) The upflush tank is for the toilet, shower, and a basin sink outside the bathroom.

There is no lease. A family member owns the house but it was purchased for my child and I, and for the future/in the will. I let Sis & BIL move in once they had their baby because they needed to get on their feet. Now 4 yrs later I am DONE with not only this issue but so many others.

I pay 50% of mortgage and 50% utils, while they each make more than I do, and together only have 50% of the mortgage, and 50% utils. BIL just spent over 3K on a trip to see family. Meanwhile, I still have to share my bathroom because they won't fix theirs. I do all the yard work, house repairs, clean their messes (and stare at their pile of junk) in the garage. Just examples from many issues.

They broke the upflush tank months after it was installed, because a bolt felt down their sink drain. And they are not keeping the plug in the sink drain to avoid this. I paid in full almost $600 to get it fixed because they were dragging their feet.

Now the tank is broken again. This time, a bobby pin was lodged in the fan inside the tank. Unlike last time, the motor is burnt out with them trying to fix themselves, so it's approx $1500 to replace/install. It's been 6 months and they still have not fixed it. I told them I'm not paying a DIME, as they were responsible for the damage. This means they are in my space to do dishes (at very late times when im trying to relax) and using my bathroom.

However, they have been using my things, going through TP without contributing, the shower gets filthy now. One time I found many many hairs ALL OVER the tub if you know what I mean, with MY scissors on the edge of the tub and my razor used. I was disgusted, and had to clean it up because she didn't!! My things get rearranged or go missing, everything knocked off my shower shelves with all the stuff in the bottom of the tub. I also have a kitten, so for now the litter box is in the bathroom until it's older. They just move it into the living room, complaining they don't like it in there when they shower. It's cleaned regularly, and they also got a kitten who is mostly upstairs in my space (not by my preference) and uses the litter box too. They haven't once helped change the Litterbox their kitten also uses, just shove it outside because they're too good to shower with it in there or clean it if they don't like it. 

WIBTA if I gave them a date and said after that date I am installing a lock on the bathroom door?? This is in the hopes of getting them to fix the tank they broke so they can use their bathroom again. Is it illegal if there is no lease but just family members not wanting to pay up for their carelessness? 

I am feeling trapped in my home due to this amongst many other things. I am at my wits end.

But I checked with one of the other *campaign side job* people I'm working with as I know I tend to overshare and wanted to sanity check my judgement. They recommended I don't do this interview, I assume given the slant of the publication but the truth is I didn't really pry on why.

Him: You assumed we have a slant? Well, we don't.

Me: good to know! But either way, I was told no.

Him: Lying crosses the line for me. Good luck, Noah.

Me: I messed up, and if you're approach is generally a ""fool me once, ..."" one, I can respect that. 
But I will defend my reputation. I am an honest person, to the best of my ability, as those who know me will attest. I am okay with you dissociating with me on the grounds that I lied, but I will not let myself be called a *liar*.
Thanks, all the best ✌️

Him: You assumed we have a slant? Well, we don't.

Me: good to know! But either way, I was told no.

Him: Lying crosses the line for me. Good luck, Noah.

Me: I messed up, and if you're approach is generally a ""fool me once, ..."" one, I can respect that. 
But I will defend my reputation. I am an honest person, to the best of my ability, as those who know me will attest. I am okay with you dissociating with me on the grounds that I lied, but I will not let myself be called a *liar*.
Thanks, all the best ✌️

We have been through everything together and also we both have kids. Mine is a lot older than her with my youngest being 7 and her only son being age 3. Well we recently got into our first huge fight where I did ask for a favor dealing with my child because it was a family emergency and i had no other help and i didnt want him to be alone and she did not help. I did talk to her about this issue and other issues where I have noticed she has never really been there physically for me when I need her the most or any big life moments of mine or with my kids like birth, baby showers,  etc. I have also never asked her for physical favors in the 11 years. Mind you I have done a lot for her and her son. I always helped her whenever I can. I grew to love her son like a nephew and he calls me auntie. Well due to this argument,  I decided that we should take a best friend break until she realizes what she has done and apologies or until I get tired of waiting for her to own up. It really hasn't been that long since this happened. Less than a month.

102,1gdt7f3,AITA for not attending my niece’s wedding ," Update: thank you all for your comments.  They obviously confirmed what I thought I should do.  This morning I sent my response to not attend without any add’l messages.  And I don’t plan to send a gift as many suggested not to do. It took a long time and a lot of therapy to get this place in my life.  I am proud that I have boundaries and don’t want to surround myself with people who genuinely don’t care about me. But it isn’t easy some days.  It’s very lonely when you make this decision for yourself even though you know it’s the right one. I don’t want to go backwards but sometimes I wish I had a family.  Even though I feel like this, I know it is the right thing for me not to attend. I know this may be hard to believe even with the way she is, but I don’t wish the worst for her. I wish all of my family could find peace and happiness. However, if they choose not to, I have to limit my interactions so that I can have my peace and happiness. 


The relationship with my sister is toxic.  She has been selfish and cruel most of my life to me and my siblings/parents.  She enjoys making comments about people’s appearance and the choices they made in their life.   
She has previously called me fat(when I weighed less than her), that I was dressed like a hooker for her wedding (dress was knee length and off the shoulder), that I wouldn’t make anything of myself by attending a state school( I have a good paying job)  

 My family seems to be intimidated by her and whenever she is around they seek her attention even though they know she will give them a gut punch. I avoid her and don’t engage with her. 

Her daughter (which I am sure means, my sister) has invited my siblings to the wedding. I don’t want to attend because I don’t think I will enjoy myself and my sister has a tendency to be cruel and/or show off at events. My siblings are giving me a hard time and state I should go for my niece. That I should keep quiet and just congratulate my sister and move on. But my niece and I don’t have a relationship. I just found out she lived in the next town for over  2 years and  never tried to contact me.  I sent a gift for her bridal shower and she didn’t acknowledge it. So I don’t think she would care one way or another if I came to the wedding.  Am I the asshole if I don’t attend ?

103,1gdt5oq,AITA for getting a coverup tattoo?,"Background: my friend (let’s call her light) gave me a tattoo when I was about 14 or so. It was a lover/loser tattoo from it and a ghost. It was on my chest and VERY visible when I would wear tank tops or any lower cut shirt. I told her when she was doing it that I would get it covered up since she was practicing. (Yes I know that’s stupid to let her practice on me but I was a young dumb teenager.) The letters were all wonky and it curved downwards. Both tattoos were poorly done and very patchy. I hated those tattoos for years and I was honestly embarrassed to have them shown when I would wear lower cut shirts. For about two years I was talking about what I was going to get it covered with and what tattoo artists I was thinking of. She knew that I wanted to get these covered and I would when it would be a good time for me. 

Now I’m 17 and decided with the cooler weather out and the fact I would be wearing regular shirts and jackets I decided that now would be a good time to get it covered since I could have it properly heal without getting hot from wearing long sleeves and full shirts that would protect it from the sun. I found an artist that I found trusted because she had done multiple of my friend’s work and they were all so beautiful. I went to get the tattoo done and it came out absolutely beautiful. I got a lotus flower because it is one of my favorite flowers. Light and I haven’t talked since early August and that was because I reached out first. We don’t speak often and don’t unless I reach out first.

104,1gdt2ef,AITA For not letting my GF win in a card game?,"Happened earlier today at my regular card shop with some friends.

For context: My Girlfriend and I started playing Lorcana in July-I have previous TCG experience in YuGiOh back in 2013-2017 but got back recently in 2023 since my favorite archetype was getting support (Raidraptors woo), but this her first TCG. She's gotten better since we first started and we have close games at times, but I typically win due to deckbuilding/decision-making, and would occasionally<>frequently remind her of effects she may miss/misinterpret which is understandable and I'm okay with helping her. At the local shop they run Lorcana pretty casually so regardless if you win/lose you get 'points', but I still like to be competitive and try. When I get locked in I have the habit of RBF, which is good for competition but catches her off guard sometimes. When we usually play each other, if I were to realize she has game, I would tell her so we could get into the next game quickly.

Now for the story: We are 1-1 in a best of 3, and she is in a position to win if she 'quests' (gains points) with all of her characters currently on the board. I notice this during my previous turn and I didn't want to show it via my face so I kept a blank expression. However she did not see her winning board and instead did 3-4 actions/moves until she finally realized, and asked if she could take them back so she could win. Because I wanted to win, I said no, sarcastically saying that she made too many moves and couldn't reset it even though we really could have. She started to get upset but played along a bit, making comments to my other friends sitting next to us saying how mean I was for taking it so seriously, which made me feel like an ass even though she missed her win condition. I doubled down on not resetting her turn and when it got to mine, I ended up having the exact number of points on my field for the win and took the game/match. After a little she got up to use the bathroom and was gone for 5 minutes, and when she came back her eyes were a little watery, but she kept herself composed, and we played some other people before heading home. In my head I was beating myself up over it, but part of me was coping that by not being as lenient, that it'd help her be a better player to check her board/effects like how I've experienced when learning to play TCGs especially modern YuGiOh (it's awful). We talked in the car and she said she wasn't upset at me, moreso at herself for not counting her field, telling me she'd excused herself after the last game as to not cry in front of people due to her tending to let out her emotions through crying and didn't want to embarass herself/me. After talking through it/communicating our feelings we made up and everything is okay/settled.

She has not had a job in over 14 years and has no plan to change that. I've managed to work multiple jobs and live in homeless shelters with her throughout high school. She claims to be ill (doesn't want to work unless it's from home + has no skills/education and is picky) and demands social disability (doctor denied this since she isn't disabled). She then went on to receive standard social benefits (much less than disability and not even close to livable wage). 


WE LIVE IN AN OVERPRICED RAT AND ROACH INFESTED PROJECT BUILDING. I cannot begin to explain the trauma I've experienced living in this condition and environment. Not to mention the guilt tripping when I say I am going to leave (""honor, thy mother and thy father"").


I have 2 siblings who have managed to swiftly distance themselves as they are older. They live with their partners in different cities. They ignore her calls and live their lives. I am so envious of this. No one tells you your parents can be your worse enemy sometimes. This is so painful to experience. Trauma, lack and scarcity, lack of accountability from your parent. 


Long story short, I cannot afford to move out into a 2 bedroom unit with her and pay all the rent. I also do not want to take her along with me (share a 1 bedroom) because I feel like she will continue to take advantage of me and I unfortunately am beginning to resent her and feel uncomfortable around her 🥺. Our only option for both of us is for her to get a job and for us to roommate this situation or for me to move to a cheaper nearby city (she doesn’t want to live there) where I can afford to live SOLO.


I have asked my work for overtime and made them aware of why I need the money. I can manage to save 1 months emergency fund + first and last months rent by January 1st. This is my goal to move. Obviously, I would like to save more but I cannot stay here any longer. I also currently pay rent/bills so waiting to save anything extra will take forever. I'm beginning to have suic/idal thoughts.

Husband (33) finally got a job, but its  2 hours away from our home, he's afraid we will drift away if we only see each other every weekend/second weekend, because he will live there. I'm used to bio dad working offshore and not being home for weeks and months at a time. So I don't see a problem tbh. Yes, it will suck, it will hopefully not last forever. But I don't want to move to an unknown city where I know no one, been there done that. It's hard to make friends my age! Haha! I'm positive because I actually think this will boost our relationship and make us feel how we were when we fell in love with each other. (There's so much more to this story, but reddit deleted the first one I made.) The problem is also we will live close to his sister and fam, and I don't want that (also a juicy story for another time). I love and adore this man, he's the love of my life, but I'm afraid I'll be miserable and hate my life if I move. I'm super close to my family, especially my granny and mom, who I see every other day. I own an apartment and my life is here.

AITA?

INFO/UPDATE: 
It's 2 hours by car. I've used to commute 3 hours a day to get to work for 3 years.
One reason I don't want to move there is because of my SIL, she's a horrible person, talking shit about me, being condescendant towards me and in general mean. Treats her step daughter like a maid and nanny. Her husband wants to divorce her and has started making plans. Poor soul. So that's also why i don't want to live close to them. I had to be the person she needed to talk to last time they had a fight.... i lied my ass off! 

I've been the one that's supported us both and my income isn't super much a month. We can't afford date nights, traveling, I had to stop putting some of my salary into my savings account because we couldn't afford it. Its been REALLY rough, and I'm afraid if this will go on for a long time, I can't do it. I'm mentally exhausted. BUT I've NEVER seen him as a burden, he's the love of my life.

110,1gdrole,AITA for setting my best friends together?,"Hi! English isn’t my first language, so I apologize for any mistakes. 
I (F18) have been best friends with Alan (M18) for 15 years we’re like siblings and always respect each other’s boundaries, especially when dating. I also have a friend, Helena (F19), who I’ve known for three years. We met in high school when she was having a tough time, and I introduced her to my friend group. Eventually, she met Alan and saw our friendship dynamic.
About a year ago, Helena felt left out because most of our group, including me, was dating. She’d only had one relationship in middle school and complained about wanting a boyfriend. I knew she found Alan attractive, so I asked him what he thought. He was open to trying but later realized they weren’t compatible, as her passive-aggressive flirting made him uncomfortable. Helena grew frustrated, and when he told her he wasn’t interested, she blamed me for setting them up.
Things got tense. Helena would try spending time with Alan, him feeling uncomfortable, started sticking with me when she was around, which made me uneasy. When I started dating someone new, she suddenly accused me of not deserving him and hinted I’d likely cheat because I’d had casual “situationships” before. 

Later, Alan told me Helena had questioned why he’d prefer me over her, implying she was better because of her wealth and status. I tried treating her normally, but she stayed distant. We had another clash during a game when I got distracted, and she overreacted, turning her strategy to ruin my game. Afterward, I talked to some friends about the situation, but now I feel guilty, as it reminds me of how her old friend group treated her.
Helena is now ghosting me, and I feel bad for talking to our friends, but I don’t know how else to handle this. I’m wondering if pushing her and Alan together started all this, even though my intentions were good.

111,1gdrnya,WIBTA if I donate to my ex-wife's gofundme for her (formerly our) cat?,"My ex-wife and I divorced about two years ago after being together for about 10 years. It was a really rough divorce. I won't get too into it here but we had many problems through our entire marriage, some from her, most from me if I'm being honest. Near the end I had an emotional affair which was the final nail in the coffin. We've been no contact ever since, years of radio silence. It was a long, rough couple years but I would say I'm mostly healed now. I never tried to contact her ever, no matter how tempted I was to write her an apology. But I'm ashamed to admit that once a month or so I check in on a tiktok account she made for our (now her) pets, a dog and two cats. I just need to see if they're doing okay. I look at the page, confirm they're still alive and healthy, and I exit the page. I know this isn't really okay or healthy for me, but I've never tried to contact her so I'm not harming her. Unfortunately somethings changed and I don't know what to do.

When I checked the page yesterday, there was a new pinned post concerning one of the cats, we'll call him Oliver. Oliver has always had urinary tract problems, and occasionally kidney stones, but it seems recently he's had more severe issues and my ex-wife has incurred a 4000 dollar vet bill getting him treatment. If he doesn't get better he'll possibly need an 8000 dollar surgery or be put down. My ex-wife has started a gofundme to cover the 4000 dollar bill, she says any extra will go toward the surgery. As you can imagine, she's not getting too much, a few hundred dollars from friend and family total over the last couple weeks. 

Now I think under normal circumstances she'd want me to stay as far away from her as possible. And I'm 50/50 on if she'd take any money from me even if it's just for the cat. But I straight up can't stand by and do nothing. I love that cat so, so much, and even though things ended badly between us I have always wished the best for my ex-wife. The idea of just sitting here on my ass while the cat we adopted together dies and she takes the financial burden on all by herself just makes me so upset that I can't stop crying. I sent her a text trying to reach out asking for permission to donate, which terrified me but I didn't know what else to do. I have no doubt I'm long blocked, even if I'm not there has been no response so far. 

Now I've thought of a way to donate completely anonymously by using gift cards, but that just feels weird. But donating normally and her seeing it's from me also feels like a terrible idea.

I was an angry temperamental teen and made ALOT of mistakes. She has also done a lot of wrong towards me as well the difference is, ive admitted my short comings and worked to change and repair damage I've done.

I've been a dad since I was 17 and without going into the crap she has tried to pull with my kid recently he had a birthday. Again while I have no interest in speaking to my mother I never stop her from being a grandmother to my kid (provided she doesn't try toxic BS). She texted me and wished him a happy birthday and he texted back ""thank you phone grandma"" she called upset *my phone was on speaker, I dont trust her enough to give her my kids number* and yelled ""what the fu** does phone grandma mean"" and my kid politely told her ""I have my grandma on my mom's side who i see all the time, I have my poppops wife who is my grandma who visits when she can, and then you as my phone grandma who calls twice a year on Christmas and my birthday"" i stepped before she said something that would make me lose my temper and she said that ""I'm your mother which means I'm his grandmother more then your dad's wife how dare you let him disrespect me like that"" and I told her ""I've never made my kid feel obligated to ""blood"" you earn titles you have in my sons life he has ""uncles"" through me that he knows aren't blood but have shown up in some hard times for him.

117,1gdqw8v,AITAH for telling my fiancèe I don’t want to spend my birthday going to the Billie Eilish concert?,"Over the past week my fiancée (34F) has been hinting towards a plan she has been working on for this upcoming weekend to celebrate my birthday.

Whenever we make plans, we like to keep them secret from the other person so it's more of a surprise in the moment. Then today, she called and asked me if we could go to the Billie Eilish concert on my actual birthday. She then told me that another option we could do was go and see the concert during the celebration weekend, but they would be more expensive so she would need me to pay for half the price of the tickets. Both concerts are a 2hour drive away.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely enjoy going to concerts with her, but we both have dramatically different tastes in music and I honestly would prefer to just have a lazy day for my birthday. At first I agreed and said we could go on my actual birthday.

My instant reaction was to say that she was the one being selfish. I regret this and wish I hadn't said it, I foolishly let my emotions take hold.

I guess I was just upset overall because I wanted my birthday to be a day that made me feel like I was the most important person for a day, so maybe I am just selfish.

Over the past week my fiancée (34F) has been hinting towards a plan she has been working on for this upcoming weekend to celebrate my birthday.

Whenever we make plans, we like to keep them secret from the other person so it's more of a surprise in the moment. Then today, she called and asked me if we could go to the Billie Eilish concert on my actual birthday. She then told me that another option we could do was go and see the concert during the celebration weekend, but they would be more expensive so she would need me to pay for half the price of the tickets. Both concerts are a 2hour drive away.

Don't get me wrong, I absolutely enjoy going to concerts with her, but we both have dramatically different tastes in music and I honestly would prefer to just have a lazy day for my birthday. At first I agreed and said we could go on my actual birthday.

I moved to my dad's for college for convenience since he lived closer. When I was still living with my mother, I was struggling with an eating disorder which made me pretty skinny, but not super thin either. My mom constantly has smug remarks about what I eat and about my body, that since I was 11. For exemple, I loved eating a nutella toast after souper instead of a normal desert, and each time I did she would look at me with a judgmental look and say: 

""You should take more veggies if your still hungry, you shouldn't eat all that sugar if you want to stay thin""

 or : 

""You're eating again? You ate so much already! Maybe you should keep it at that"" 

This made me feel like eating was shameful and that people would see me as a pig if I ate in front of them. Now that I have a job, am in college and am dating a man who I love dearly, I have been eating more ""bad"" food than before which did make me gain a good 15 pounds. As much as I see myself as huge because of my eating disorder, loved ones assured me I was normal size. I am far from obesity just got bigger thighs and a little bit of belly fat. When I went to visit my mom after my first college session my mom looked at me up and down and scoffed saying: 

""You got pretty fat, you should stop eating all that junk"".

""What the f is wrong with you! Fat shaming your kid? Good job mom, then you wonder why I haven't been visiting much!""

And stormed to my room where my sister(12F) reassured me. My mom did come to apologize but right after added:

Of course this rubbed me the wrong way and I told her how I wouldn't take her bullying anymore and how much it hurt me.

120,1gdq15t,AITA for Telling My Sister She’s a Terrible Parent?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons...

So, here’s the situation. I (30M) have a sister, ""Laura"" (32F), who has a son, ""Jake"" (8M). Laura and her husband are both busy professionals, and I get that life can be hectic. But lately, I’ve been really concerned about how they’re raising Jake.

Last week, I went over to their house for dinner. After dinner, it was a typical evening for their household: Laura was on her phone half the time, and her husband was glued to the TV. Meanwhile, Jake was playing video games in the other room, completely ignored. At one point, I went to check on him, and he was watching some ridiculous YouTube video about pranks. I was shocked and called Laura into the room to show her what he was watching.

Her reaction? She brushed it off, saying he was “just being a kid” and that I was overreacting. I couldn't believe it. This is the kind of stuff that can really mess up a kid’s head! So, I got a bit heated and told her that the reason this happened in the first place was because she had a kid too young, and that if she’s not going to pay attention to him, she shouldn’t be surprised when he ends up getting hurt, acting out, or having weird political beliefs. I said, “You’re a terrible parent if you can’t even be bothered to monitor what your kid is watching.”

Let's just say, that didn’t go over well at all. Laura got upset and started crying like she usually does and called me an ""arrogant know-it-all."" I couldn't help but laugh (I usually do in uncomfortable situations). Her husband backed her up, saying I had no idea what it’s like to raise a kid. But honestly, I couldn’t just sit back and be complicit in this any longer. They need to hear the truth!

Now, my parents are caught in the middle and think I was too harsh and are threatening to kick me out, which would *literally* make me homeless. They’re saying I should have kept my mouth shut and just enjoyed dinner. But I feel like if I don’t say something, who will? Will no one stand up for what's right anymore?

We are both autistic and he and his wife have been very welcoming to me. Because Zack was an outcast in high school, he's a friend to all, but he has a fascination with trying to have gorgeous young women as friends and worshipping them. I have accepted this about him (his wife accepts it too) because I've never seen him do anything inappropriate, he does a LOT to try to help their lives and they seem very happy with his help and friendship.

  
His biggest obsession is Gemini (24/f), and he will send me many messages obsessing over her beauty, which gets tedious. Once, he told me that he and I were average and nobody would leave their partner for us but Gemini was so beautiful anyone would leave their partner for her. I told him that hurt my feelings and he apologized. Later in time, Zack said Gemini has no female friends because they were all jealous, and asked me to befriend her too. I agreed.

  
I have been single and lonely for years due to trauma; autism  , plus not being attractive. I've accepted I won't find anyone interested in me but I still kind of grieve it. But lately, visible aging starts to show on me, and I've gone from being treated as invisible to being treated as worthless trash by the public.

  
I moved again to a nearby city, and Zack and Gemini came to visit and stay with me all weekend. We went out to dinner, and I approached the host to ask for a table. He was rude, snappy, rolled his eyes at me, and acted like I was subhuman. Then Gemini showed up and he turned into a different person. Grinning, laughing: repeatedly asking her if there was anything else she wanted or needed. I felt humiliated and ashamed. I told them how I was feeling.

Gemini smiled and said ""Yeah sometimes I wish I wasn't pretty"":and went on a LONG tirade about how if her friends are interested in a guy, she always approaches the guy to ""make sure they are cool"" and the guys always ends up into her instead and she can't help it. Zack said ""that sucks most women are so jealous of you "" They held a 10 minute conversation about the hardship of Gemini being so pretty, and ignored me.

Anyway, we get to the airport and check in. Turns out, the airline messed up our seat assignments and my girlfriend and I are in different rows. No big deal, we figure we’ll ask someone to switch. Then her mom pipes up and says, “Oh, no, MY baby can’t possibly sit with a stranger for FIVE HOURS! You switch with me!”
Now, I was already in the middle seat, which nobody likes. Her mom was in the aisle seat of the row in front of me. So basically, she wanted me to switch from a middle seat to a middle seat, just so she could be next to her adult daughter.
I politely declined, saying I didn’t want to be in the middle seat for that long. Her mom went OFF. Started ranting about how I was being disrespectful, how I clearly didn’t care about her daughter, how I was ruining the trip before it even started. My girlfriend was awkwardly quiet the whole time.
Eventually, her mom stormed off in a huff and sat by herself. My girlfriend and I got to sit together after all because someone else offered to switch. But the whole flight was tense, and her mom keeps making snide comments about me.

Later, I pick up my sister from work and she asks me about Val asking why I lied about being sick (which I didn't) and I freeze. She tells me Val called her saying I lied about being sick to not hang out with her and invited her over for drinks. I tell my sister how I felt about this whole thing and she said she understands, I apologised for what I said but she didn't mind now. Now I don't even know if I should I even waste my time to talk to Val when she's acting like this. I'm so tired.",0.0,1.0694116,1,0

My oldest brother, 23, recently picked me up from school, and I asked him to go to Starbucks because I had a gift card. He agreed, and bought me one, but when I handed the card over, there was still 75¢ I had to pay. I didn’t realize, because I had my headphones on, and my brother covered it without me knowing. Because I didn’t realize, (and I had thanked him beforehand) I didn’t thank him for covering the 75¢. I mostly didn’t talk during the drive home, mainly because I was really stressed with homework I was doing. (For context I want to be a nurse.)

A few days later, my mother told me that my brother was angry because I hadn’t thanked him, and because I hadn’t spoken to him a lot. He hasn’t been speaking to me a lot, and when I went to his house to play with my niece, he completely ignored me.
