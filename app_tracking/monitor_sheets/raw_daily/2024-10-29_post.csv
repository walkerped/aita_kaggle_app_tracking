0,1gf1qmi,AITA for not wanting to bond with my father's girlfriend ?,"First of all, I (17 F) know I'm probably a horrible person but I need an opinion from people that don't know me or my family.

Okay, some context : My parents separated last year when I was abroad to learn a new language. It was a whole year trip organised by my school. I was completely aware of that and knew it was for the best since they weren't in love and weren't happy together anymore. My father moved in another appartment. When I came back from my trip, my father told me he was now with another woman. They were together even before my father moved for another appartment, when I left to do my language trip. I learned that his new girlfriend live in the same building as my mother (cliché I know).

Okay onto the story. My father introduced me to his girlfriend and we spent a day together. All I knew after this day was that this was new to me and I needed time to get used to this situation. The days passed and some things I was uncomfortable with.

It's here I might be an asshole and I genuinely need advices/opinions 😅. Firstly she insists a lot to talk to me, spend time with me, etc. I don't have problems with her wanting to get to know me but she insists a lot. When we meet her, she would always come to me and ask me about my day, how I do in school, if I have problems (?), etc. I know it's not flagrant with text but she really insists a lot. Secondly, she already met my father's parents. Same, I don't have any problems with that, the thing is : my parents are not divorced yet. They are separated but not divorced. It's making me a bit uncomfortable but I don't know if that feeling is legitimate.
 
The event that made me write this post is an evening to a restaurant with my father, my father's parents and my father's girlfriend. I was very uncomfortable at this dinner and I didn't talk much (not that I talk much st family dinners anyway). When we were back home, my father told me that he ""didn't know he had such an impolite daughter"", that his girlfriend was trying to fit in this family and that I should be ashamed of my behavior. He also told me I was stupid for blaming the separation of him and my mother on his girlfriend. I never did nor say that once, even in thoughts. I don't even know this woman that much. I tried to explain to my father that I was simply uncomfortable with this situation for now but he said he didn't understand why and that there was nothing to be uncomfortable about.

So here's my story, I honestly don't know if I'm wrong here and if I am, I would take advices. So AITA? ",TL;DR,2024-10-29,"AITA for not wanting to bond with my father's girlfriend ?

1,1gf151j,AITA For getting kicked out of my parents house?,"So this sort of begins when I was a teenager, I got my drivers permit at 16 but I wasn’t allowed to get my license because my grades were not what my parents wanted. If I couldn’t keep my grades up then it did not reflect the responsibility I needed to be able to drive alone. I turned 18 at the height of COVID so drivers tests were limited and my family was not going in public, especially crowded areas very often. After everything died down, I got a job at my younger siblings school but I still relied on my father for transportation which I hated because I just wanted to be independent. Finally, I got another job, which was out of the way and was full time, which required my dad to do a lot of running around. Finally, at 21, I got my drivers license. I also did not have a credit score, so financing a car was not in the cards for me. Instead, my dad got himself a truck and I took over the payments on the car he already owned. Fast forward a year later and the car starts having problems which my dad knew about. I told him that it was making horrible sounds and wasn’t running well. One day on my way home from work it got so bad I was worried about breaking down. He said “hopefully you make it to work tomorrow” to which my friend that I worked with offered to pick me up that night so I could go to work with her in the morning. Being me, I had to prove a point and I drove to work the next morning and shocking no one, I broke down on a busy road during rush hour. After taking the car to the mechanic it was going to cost over $5000 to fix    My parents wanted me to pay all of it, but I didn’t just have $5000 laying around. I worked at a smaller, family owned business and I was pretty close with the owner. Due to so much stress I ended up in her office talking about how stressed I was and she offered to help with the car. But once I told her the whole situation (how much was still left on the loan, the cars mileage, and how much repairs will cost) she said she’d rather loan me money to buy a car in my name that will last me years. When I brought this idea up to my parents they obviously got upset and we got in an argument. I already knew they’d be mad, my friends mom had already offered to let me stay with them, my boyfriend stayed outside while I talked to them. We got in a huge argument, which I think they were upset that I had a plan if they were to kick me out. They also say I was lying to everyone around me and that I was making them look bad because I was telling people around me the situation I was in. That all happened in August and I haven’t really spoken to them since. My younger sister and cousin sent me incredibly rude messages, my sister also sent my friend messages out of anger. I feel so guilty but I was doing so much as the oldest sibling, being in school and working full time. I kind of felt stuck and I did not want to be paying for that car for the next 4 years.

Over the past decade+ of bdays I can’t remember a single one that I didn’t plan myself or if I didn’t plan then nothing happened. I.e.1 bday in early 30s he planned baseball camp for my son-we did not celebrate my birthday during that time even though we went out to dinner and the waiter askd if it was special occasion he flat out said no, I chimed in after two margaritas and said hell yeah bring me cake!

My fiancée said “no, I’m happy at home” and just left it at that, and Matt apparently said “whatever buddy” then also dropped it… My fiancée is not very confrontational so he just left it alone, but told me what happened as soon as he got home. I have only ever met Matt a handful of times for short periods and have been nothing but nice to him, I even drove him home one time after work because of car issues (was there to pick up my fiancée, they are coworkers) and I’m honestly super hurt that he tried to encourage my fiancée to talk to other women when I wasn’t around, and I’m not sure why he even did this. He obviously knows we’re engaged as he’s received an invite to our wedding but I don’t want him to come anymore to be honest.

Why was my fiancée out of everyone the one who he tried getting to talk to these other women? I’m now wondering if he has something against me… 

I’m in no way upset with my fiancée, I trust him completely, but this whole situation has just really rubbed me the wrong way.

5,1gf02za,AITA for not leaving the club with my friend in Ibiza?,"So I am looking for a balanced perspective on this. I know that I am at least partly in the wrong, but I don't know to what extent.

So my university friend (22F) and I (23F) went on holiday together. This friend is lovely but I sometimes feel that she tells me what to do. Of course, I'm not perfect either, so I overlook it.

We went to Ibiza for a week with two of her other friends whom I'd never met before. We did what everyone in Ibiza does, we partied every night; the tickets and the whole holiday were very expensive, with some being over £100. Both of us had never been to Ibiza before, and so we seized every opportunity to go and see all the clubs/events that we could.

We mostly had a good time there. There were bickers here and there, but nothing major. But on the last night, something happened. We went to ""Hi"" which is supposed to be the best club in the world. We were going home the next day. The tickets were expensive, and I felt that this would be probably the only time I would be able to get to see this club considering the cost of the holiday.

My friend said she wasn't enjoying the event so she wanted to go home. I felt I hadn't seen enough of it since we had only been there for a couple of hours (maybe 2?) My friend said that if I don't go home with her I'm selfish. I said that considering how every other night I had gone home with her and stayed out with her, I thought we should compromise. But she didn’t want to, and it turned into hurtful things being said. She started shouting at me. I raised my tone too and she told me not to take that tone with her. She called me selfish, I called her hypocritical. She said she was going home with or without me, and if I didn't come back with her she would never talk to me again because I would be choosing an event over our friendship. I didn't see it that way. I saw it as her getting angry that I wasn't doing what she says.

I said I was staying and she stormed off. The next day, she was very angry. We went on a walk and she said I'm selfish, ""not a girls' girl"", unkind, greedy, immature and should know better at 23, that she knows I'm in therapy but I need to work on myself for future friendships. She said that I've treated her horribly considering how caring of a friend she is. She said she's always had my back- she had to convince the friends she brought with her to give me a chance. As apparently they disliked me at first because I'm ""posh"" and ""shy"". She said she was ending our friendship.

She said that her friends and family think that I'm vile. On the plane ride back, she talked about me to a stranger next to me so I could hear it. I didn't know how to react so I said nothing.

I feel like I should have gone back with her, but I felt bossed around. Could I please have some insight into this situation? I want to learn and grow from this. And the fact that she's talking about me in such a negative light actually bothers me.

6,1gf00q8,AITA for not texting my dad before school?,"i (13F) am enrolled in online school. for context, i was in foster care at 11-13 due to issues with my parents, particularly my dad not logging my attendance (and his drug problem). last night, my dad (51M) came home and got mad at me because I didn’t see his texts asking if i was in school. i was busy, so i didn’t know he had texted. he often wants me to confirm i’m in school, which i forget sometimes. i get why hes anxious, but the argument got rlly out of hand

he got aggressive, yelling and getting in my face. i could smell alcohol on his breath, which was expected since he has a drinking problem. he drinks every day, so i can’t always tell if he’s drunk. when I tried to defend myself, he yelled at me for backtalking and told me to “shut the fuck up and go to my fucking room” i didn’t want him to see me cry, so i did. he said i was acting like my mom and even accidentally called me her name which offended me a bit

9,1gezu6q,AITA for throwing away the ADHD medication my mother was secretly taking?,"I (f18) was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, and since then, I have been taking different types of medication to improve my quality of life. Around 2023, I started treatment with Ritalin, but I didn't adapt to the medication, so after talking to my doctor about changing medications, I stored the few remaining boxes on the shelf in my room and left them there. 

It turns out that a few months ago, I started to notice that some boxes were missing... I confronted my mother (f45) and she admitted that she was taking the medication in secret, because she believed that she also had ADHD. 

(Additional context: she doesn't believe in >MY< ADHD diagnosis, which was confirmed by very expensive neuropsychological tests, but she is completely convinced that SHE HAS ADHD based on the Facebook videos she watches. Oh... and she has had eating disorders since she was a teenager, which means she doesn't have a good relationship with her own body.) 

The thing is, she has never been to a psychiatrist in her life and she never goes when I schedule appointments for her. I firmly believe that she only takes it for the side effects: appetite suppression, euphoria and increased motivation. This is NOT good for her, especially since she has never cared about taking care of her own mental health, she doesn't even BELIEVE in the possibility of improvement through cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Anyway, let's get to the facts: I was furious when I found out that she had been taking the medication without any kind of medical guidance and I simply threw away ALL the boxes of Ritalin remaining. She got really mad at me, saying that she paid for it with ""her own"" money (my dad's money actually) and called me... well, an asshole.

10,1gezi7w,AITA for accidentally cutting my bfs toenail too short?,"So early this afternoon I 19F was doing my nails and I noticed that my bf 22M who was sitting beside me hadn’t cut his toenails in ages, enough that they were poking over the ends of his toes and had that icky discolouration. I told him I wanted to cut his toe nails and asked him to put his foot on my lap. 

I cut all his toenails and filed them since they can be super scratchy in bed if I don’t and was down to the last pinky toe and I accidentally cut a little too low. He said ouch and I apologised and went to finish cutting the nail off, but he kept jerking his foot so when I went to clip down I accidentally cut too low again. 

It wasn’t enough to draw blood or anything but he started cradling his foot and closely inspecting the toe. I apologised and said I didn’t mean too and it was an accident because he was jerking his foot. I then asked if I could just file it so it wouldn’t scratch me later, to which he got super mad at me.

He kept going on about how it’s his body and such, which I understand, but the problem is he doesn’t do any basic foot hygiene at all.
If I ask his to cut his toenails and wash his feet he won’t do it for days at minimum, and generally by the time I ask him to cut his toenails they are already reeking of toe cheese. 

He said he will file the nail and I asked if he knew how to do it. He didnt reply so i asked again if i could just do this last toe because otherwise it will scratch me, to which he replied “Well I’ll just scratch you then."" At this point I was starting to get pretty mad because if he did this when I asked, or better without being asked we wouldn’t have a problem to being with. 

The argument continued to escalate, he kept going on about how I didn’t believe that I hurt him even though I apologised when it happened, I was just trying to make it clear that if he hadn’t been jerking his foot the way a puppy jerks their paw when getting their nails clipped, I wouldn’t have cut too low for a second time. I’ll admit I did feel a bit like he was overreacting, and the only reason he wouldn’t let me just file the nail and finish the job was to be spiteful. 

At that point we started arguing about a whole bunch of other stuff as well, and now I feel like shit, I feel like I overstepped and was being irrational. 

TLDR I cut my bfs toenail too short because he kept jerking him foot, and he got really mad at me.

","I (29F), an American nurse, am married to my amazing husband (30M), who’s Arab and works as a software engineer. We’ve been married for a few years and have one child together. To be honest, my husband is *incredibly* handsome—he’s tall, with olive skin and striking green eyes. I admit I’ve dealt with some jealousy now and then because, well, women notice him a lot. 😅

We actually met because of his health. He has pernicious anemia, meaning he needs a B12 injection every month for life, and I was his nurse. Over time, we fell in love and got married. He’s kind, caring, and a wonderful father, but he still holds on to some Middle Eastern habits. For example, he refuses to kiss in public, especially in front of family, and he prefers to keep a little distance from my family, saying that *too much interaction often leads to unnecessary problems*. I’ve come to respect that—it’s just part of who he is.

Recently, though, something weird happened. My younger sister (25F) decided to spread a story that my husband is cold, rude, and mistreats me, and that I’m too afraid to tell anyone. I have NO idea why she did this, but my parents completely believed her. They began dropping by my house frequently, saying they just wanted to check in and see how I was doing with the baby.

After a while, my mom finally confessed the real reason for their visits—they were worried about me because of the story my sister told them. I was *furious*. When I confronted my sister, she just laughed and said it was a joke, but the damage was already done, and now my parents were seriously concerned.

So, on my husband’s birthday, I decided to invite the entire family over. I thought, “Okay, let’s end this nonsense once and for all.” During the celebration, I gave my husband a kiss in front of everyone. Now, keep in mind that my husband is incredibly shy about public affection—he immediately turned red and looked so embarrassed.

Later, after the guests left, he told me he was really angry. He felt humiliated and said that I knew how much he dislikes being put on the spot like that, especially in front of our families. I explained that I only did it to shut down the rumors my sister had started and to show everyone that our relationship is perfectly fine.

Now, I feel guilty because I hate making him uncomfortable, especially on his birthday. But at the same time, I felt I needed to take control of the situation and stop my family from believing the nonsense my sister had spread.

We dated long-distance for a year and saw each other twice—once she came to here and stayed for a month, and the other time I spent almost three months in her country. Early on, when she visited me, things went well with almost no conflicts. But when I went to her with eight months of dating, I noticed some troubling behaviors:

* She yelled at her mom and even told her to shut up;
* She would restrict when I could shower depending on her mood;
* When I made her breakfast, she simply said, “You eat it;”
* In a discussion where we were trying to work things out, she went to check social media;
* When I gave her flowers, she just had a closed-off expression;
* I wanted her to learn my language to better communicate with my family, but she always said she wouldn’t because she was “too lazy”;
* She gave me the silent treatment.

On top of this, her mom put a lot of pressure on me to propose, to the point where I wasn’t allowed to discuss our future until I formally asked for her hand. After I returned to Brazil, almost anything caused arguments. She rarely picked up my calls or responded to messages, sometimes going four days without replying and blaming it on me. This affected me deeply, even impacting my work.

These issues happened maybe 10-15% of the time I was with her; most of the time, she was a great person, and I have no complaints in that regard.

After the breakup, I got closer to someone from our shared social circle here. She was the complete opposite, and as we talked regularly, we started going out, and now we’ve been dating for a short time.

So far, things have been great. I was completely transparent with her about the risk she was taking in dating someone so soon after a breakup, and she was fine with it.

16,1geyprs,AITA for excluding my brother from my wedding because of his “fun facts”?,"I have an older brother David (41). David has boundary issues and was in the learning disabled classes. My parents never let him out of the home. He has an very rough personality and because he was never allowed to work or do anything so in his 40’s he doesn’t have friends. He still dominates the conversation at every holiday with “fun facts” and goes off on those and doesn’t realize no one is listening. 

My other siblings and I just really don’t like David because my parents let him do whatever and just dominate whatever social settings we are in. My older sister eloped because of David being my mom kept trying to find David a “place” at her wedding. 

I’m getting married to Mel, and my youngest brother Nick is my best man. My sister who is close to Mel is in the bridal party.  Her husband is one of my best men and their son is a ring bearer.  My wife wants a real wedding and not be forced to elope like my sister did. 

David has no place. He’s not going to be invited because the first thing he did was insult the ring I got my Mel was his “fun facts” about how diamonds are worthless and do not resell well. I should have got her a second hand engagement ring or a colored stone engagement ring. We then got a history on engagement rings and marriage tradition. We tried shutting him up but he wouldn’t and my mom said let “the professor talk” Even at 40 she thinks my brother ""fun facts"" are cute. 

This put a hard no on Mel’s stance that my brother can't come to the wedding. If my parents defend him, even once, they are not coming. She not having not wedding like my sister and it’s time for David to be put in his place. 

Mom called and asked about wedding planning and I told her she wasn’t involved after what happened to my sister wedding dress shopping (Mom brought David who told everyone his fun facts about wedding dress history) that’s when my sister decided to elope. 

I told mom if she and dad wanted to come to the wedding as guests they can but David isn’t invited. Mom didn’t talk for awhile. I think she started crying because my dad took over the phone call. I told him what upset mom and said David isn’t invited and mom can’t be trusted to be involved in wedding planning without David tagging along. 

Dad said he doesn’t understand why we all hate David and I told him what is wrong with his “fun facts”  My dad said “the boy likes to talk and there’s no harm in it” 

I told my dad that’s the thing there is harm in David’s ""fun facts"" and now no one wants to be around him. 

Dad started arguing saying stuff in defense of David and I told dad we are at a stalemate and I guess all 3 of you won’t be coming to the wedding.  I’m sorry but that is how it is. I ended the conversation with my dad and my mom has been upset texting like a crazy person to everybody about how we all need to understand David. What I’m doing is mean.

17,1geyozh,AITA for suggesting my mother should risk upsetting my stepdad to spend time with me?,"I, 25F, recently moved back home into my parents’ house following the breakdown of a long-term relationship and subsequent abusive home situation (but alas that is not the subject of this post). Living in the house is myself, my mother (47F), stepfather (44M) and brother (23M). My mother and stepfather married earlier this year and have been in a relationship for the past few years, so I didn’t grow up with him around. Despite this, I really like my stepfather and it’s clear that he adores my mum. My mum was never the sort to date when I was younger, and I was always afraid she would be by herself. 

When I was younger and still living at home, my mum and I used to spend most of our free time together, watching TV shows we liked, playing games and just generally having a lot of fun. My brother was the type to lock himself in his room all day; I didn’t. 

Since returning home, hanging out with my parents is monotonous and boring. They have this set routine of watching the same TV shows every single day once they wake up, and if I dare to watch something that my stepdad doesn’t want to watch, it’s a huge issue with my mum. She spends all day cuddling with my stepdad on the sofa with her iPad. It’s not like it was before. I can’t even talk when they’re engrossed in their shows. I just get cursed out and told to be quiet.

We had an argument a couple of days ago when I wanted to show her a quick 3 minute YouTube video. I knew there was no chance that she would watch it when she was in her routine, so I waited until my parents had gotten ready for work (they work together) and would be leaving in 10 minutes or so. My stepdad was still getting ready and my mum had come into the lounge, so I suggested watching this video. Her exact response was “Do I have to?” and I completely lost my shit. I’d said something like she didn’t have to but I was only asking for 3 minutes of her life. It led onto me getting upset over her insistence on spending every waking moment with her husband and ignoring my existence entirely, and she responded that he was her husband and she should be spending her day with him. I answered that he may be her husband but I am her daughter. I asked for her to do some of the things we used to like doing when he’s in as well, watch an episode of a TV show, play a game for an hour, anything. Maybe he gets a bit upset about it, but I missed the way we used to be. She exclaimed that I was out of line and swiftly left for work with my stepdad as soon as he was ready - he hadn’t overheard any of the conversation, but no doubt they’ve talked about it. 

My real question is, AITA for asking for a disruption to the routine just to do something we like together? Or is their time together their time and I don’t have a right to impede on it? Should I settle for the few and far between days where he is working and she isn’t?

He is right. 


Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount. 

Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it. 

This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past.

Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment. 



So my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can. 

Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it. 

I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday. 

I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her. 

She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole. 

My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume. 

If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.

My self and partner (33F 38M) are childfree, both work full time. 


He is insistent that every meal we eat needs meat. I'm not too fussed, but when I cook I always make sure there's a meat element. 


Over the last few months he's been ""going off"" certain meats. Pork? Nope. Beef? Nope


We can't even have bacon or sausages (unless they're chicken sausages) 


We normally split cooking based on work load, and the last couple of months I've been working OT so haven't been finishing work until 7/8 at night so he's been cooking all our dinners. And everything is chicken based. 

Chicken curry, chicken pie, chicken and rice

Chicken chicken chicken


I've not said anything because I'm grateful I have a dinner to come home to. But I am sooo tired of chicken


My works calmed down over the last few weeks so I've been able to cook for us again, but it's just complaint after complaint. And all about the meat 


I made a chilli, why couldn't I use chicken mince? 

Made toad in the hole, chicken sausages are as nice as pork

Made a steak dinner, why couldn't we have chicken breast? 


I told my partner tonight I was making a apple pork casserole and he asked why it couldn't be apple chicken? I snapped. 


Because I don't want to spend my life eating only chicken. I'll eat only chicken when he cooks, but if I'm cooking I'll do a variety of meals and meats. If he didn't like it, don't eat it. That I am so fucking done with just chicken 


He told me I'm being a dick because his tastes have changed and I should stand with him with it all. Chicken has so many different ways of being made 


But I don't want to just eat chicken

We normally split cooking based on work load, and the last couple of months I've been working OT so haven't been finishing work until 7/8 at night so he's been cooking all our dinners. And everything is chicken based. 

Chicken curry, chicken pie, chicken and rice

Chicken chicken chicken


I've not said anything because I'm grateful I have a dinner to come home to. But I am sooo tired of chicken


My works calmed down over the last few weeks so I've been able to cook for us again, but it's just complaint after complaint. And all about the meat 


I made a chilli, why couldn't I use chicken mince? 

Made toad in the hole, chicken sausages are as nice as pork

Made a steak dinner, why couldn't we have chicken breast? 


I told my partner tonight I was making a apple pork casserole and he asked why it couldn't be apple chicken? I snapped. 


Because I don't want to spend my life eating only chicken. I'll eat only chicken when he cooks, but if I'm cooking I'll do a variety of meals and meats. If he didn't like it, don't eat it. That I am so fucking done with just chicken 


He told me I'm being a dick because his tastes have changed and I should stand with him with it all. Chicken has so many different ways of being made 


But I don't want to just eat chicken

23,1gexs6k,AITA for not helping my unstablly mental friend.,"Tw: SU threads, medicine.

I (F, 28) have been friends with “Dara” (30, F) for over 12 years. We’ve always been close and supportive of each other, especially through struggles with mental health. However, in recent years, I’ve focused on setting boundaries and taking care of my own well-being, which has sometimes created distance between us. I’ve had a lot on my plate—burnout, ADD diagnosis, family issues—and often lack the energy to give everyone the support they need.

A few months ago, after a disagreement, I tried to set boundaries with Dara, who responded with guilt-tripping comments (saying things like; It would be a shame if I die and we don't have any contact) about our friendship. Though we resolved things, I started keeping a bit more emotional distance, limiting my responses to her issues and celebrating her successes when it felt authentic.

Recently, Dara had a crisis in a group chat with our friends Eri and Faya (both in their 30s and pregnant), where she mentioned mixing medications with alcohol. Eri tried to calm her down, and even called D’s mom for help. Dara didn’t take this well, and things got tense. I ended up supporting Eri and Faya privately, but didn’t reach out to Dara, as the group chat dissolved before I had the chance.

Question: Am I wrong for not reaching out to Dara after her episode, even though I supported Eri and Faya? I’m torn between distancing myself for my own well-being and wanting to maintain a long-standing friendship with someone who knows me so well. I don’t mind listening to friends’ problems, but I need the energy for it and don’t want to be blamed if I don’t have it.

Tl;dr: AITA for not supporting my mentally unstable friend Dara but helping Eri and Faya, who were also affected by her actions?

24,1gexisp,AITA for pulling my friend aside and telling him to stfu?,"So, my [M17] best friend, Henry [M17], has this thing. I wouldn't describe it as a lack of filter, but more of a lack of fear when it comes to the things he says? He will say the most personal things in the worst situations, some of which could get himself or others hurt, and it's like he doesn't know when to stop. 

Typically, the things he talks about are more on the controversial side. Important context, the both of us are trans men living in the deep south. I, naturally, to stay safe, am so deep in the closet that I couldn't claw my way out if I wanted to. He isn't. I understand being out, and believe me, I want to more than anything, but I just don't believe it's safe for me. I'm glad he feels safe, but I worry for him so much. I'm so scared he'll say the wrong thing and get hate crimed or worse.

Today he was talking to a grown man and a guy friend of ours, I was in the conversation too, and he started bringing up controversial things. Gender, sexuality, the fucking upcoming election and voting for Harris [we can't even vote yet???], things like that. I was on edge, but fine. Free speech and all. Then I saw that look in his eyes that he was about to bring me into this, he was gonna mention something about My gender or sexuality.

Usually, I'm able to change the topic pretty quickly whenever he gets like this, but not today. I excused us, saying I had to go to the bathroom and asked if he'd come with me. When we got there, I told him to shut the fuck up, that he was walking a mighty fine line, and that he was putting us both in danger.

He gave me this weird look and told me to quit being an asshole, said he could talk about whatever he wanted, and that nothing was gonna happen to either of us.

Another tidbit of important information, one of my very close friends was murdered 2 years ago. I'm not saying it's because she was a trans woman, but I can't prove it wasn't. Trans people in my town are not fucking treated well. I had a friend that was out, publicly. He's homeschooled now because the treatment was God awful.

I'm trying to keep us safe. I don't want anything bad to happen to us, if this shit about either of us gets back to my parents I'm dead. Sure, I could've phrased it a little better, but I genuinely believe his mouth will get us in huge trouble.

After our little squabble in the bathroom, one of my other friends came up to me a few minutes later and asked what happened, because she heard I was being a douchebag.

I obviously couldn't explain the situation to her, but I guess I can to y'all. What do you think, AITA?

I think I may have been harsh, but surely it was justified, right? I'm not in the wrong here? Or am I? I don't know.

26,1gexekm,AITA for siccing process server on someone who had left my address down as the registered address for some of his LLCs and wouldn't fix it?,"Bit of an odd one.  I moved into a new house a few years ago.  From the start, we have gotten a ton of mail addressed to various LLCs that all seem related to a property company (call it ""AptCo"").  Many of them have come with return addresses / logos that I recognize as local plaintiffs' law firms.  In the last 18 months, we have gotten doorbell rings for several certified mail deliveries (which we refuse).  I tried many times to reach out to ""AptCo"", but they have no phone # I can find.  I've emailed every address I can come up with, but I don't get a response.  

I tried to figure out why we are getting the mail, and it turns out the principal of AptCo is a prominent local real estate investor, and almost twenty years ago he used to own and live in our house.  I went to the State Corp Commission website and saw that there were several LLCs with our house as the registered address.  I called them and asked to change it, but they said the request has to come from the owner.  So I am back to square one.

Meanwhile, we recently started to get visits from the sheriff and process servers trying to ""serve"" lawsuit papers.  The first time the sheriff showed up, it was stressful.  The last straw was that a process server showed up when only my 13yo son was home and he was very aggressive with my kid.  That motivated me to try to track down the principal of AptCo.  It turns out he belongs to same golf club that my recently moved-here inlaws joined (really only fancy one in the area), and they got me his email.  I emailed him asking him to change the addresses and I heard nothing back from him.  I asked my inlaws to try to maybe find him at the club and buttonhole him.  They did and he said basically ""have them email my assistant"", which I did, and again got no response.

Here's where I may be the AH.  I made a plan for the next time a process server might show up.  I asked my inlaws, is he a member of any regular golf game or activity?  And indeed, there is a men's group that he is a part of.  The next time process-server showed up (a few weeks ago), I told him this was wrong address, but that he could for sure find the principal of AptCo at XYZ County Club at 2pm any Tuesday.   The next Tuesday, the principal was embarrassed by getting served in front of all his friends at the golf club.  My inlaws said it was the talk of the club.  Then I posted disingenuously to NextDoor, ""hey, anybody here know how to reach Mr. X of AptCo?  He must be quite a slumlord, as my address is mistakenly down as registered address for some of his entities and I am getting process servers showing up constantly!  Would appreciate any leads, and obviously if you are in the market to rent, probably consider avoiding AptCo.""

Well, suddenly Mr. X was willing to call me back!  He screamed at me for embarrassing him and said I was an asshole for not finding another way to address the issue.  So, did I go too far?

Even though stuff was all closed and we were meant to stay home, they threw a huge gender reveal because they had always wanted a girl and wanted to celebrate the fact they were getting a girl with everyone they knew. My parents took video of their reaction and one they posted to their socials at the time. It was of them screaming and crying and cheering that they *had their dream come true, getting the child they always dreamed of, the daughter they had always wanted and how they couldn't wait to be parents*. The video got taken down after mom's sister told her she had no idea how lucky she was to have a healthy child and went no contact with my parents (she and her husband had fertility trouble and couldn't have kids).

But I knew from a really early age I disappointed my parents by being a boy. Looking at photos and videos of them before me vs after me, you can see the joy fade. They were told I was a girl. Had clothes, a nursery and everything set up for a girl. They even had a name picked out for girl me. Then I was born a boy.

There are photos of us with extended family but like just me and them over the 12 years of my life? Nah.

From young, Lisa had always been a girl that was constantly in relationships, getting a new boyfriend every few months. Obviously, I wasn’t too happy about it because all of Lisa’s boyfriends turned out to be complete a-holes. But the thing is, I found it odd how she’d cry everyday after breaking up and then immediately find a new boyfriend.

As time went on, Lisa started dating guys that were much older than her and honestly, it irked me. I mean, what kind of decent guy would go for a kid? So I tried to talk her out of it, to tell her just how wrong it was. Lisa hated that tho. We’d get into big fights because she kept saying i was being too judgy when it wasn’t even my life but all I was trying to do was to ensure that she’ll be safe so her dismissing my concern like that made me feel like she didn’t even care about me. Every time she got a new boyfriend, she’d neglect our friendship. And even if we did hang out, all she’d do is rant and complain. If tell her that older guys are just taking advantage of her, she’d get mad at me and the cycle would continue. We only made up because she’d pretend that nothing happened and I just accepted that because I didn’t want to lose my best friend.

That went on for years, progressively getting worse and I just gave up. I stopped caring. I knew all about her and her life but she knew nothing about mine. I felt more like a therapist to her than a friend. I was so sick and tired of her ranting about the same exact thing.

She’d ask to call for 5 minutes but the calls would end up taking hours because she’d repeat the same thing over and over again.

31,1gevtf3,AITA for taking back a family heirloom from my DIL before the wedding ,"I won't respond to repeat questions, check the comments

My family has two heirlooms that we give to a bride or groom when they marry. For the men, it’s a set of cufflinks, and for the women, it’s a bracelet. My oldest son and my oldest sister are married, and their spouses wore the bracelet or cufflinks at their weddings. This tradition is essentially our family’s way of saying, “We’re accepting you into the family.”

When my future DIL got engaged, I gave her the bracelet and explained that it’s a family heirloom, expressing how meaningful it would be if she wore it at the wedding. I mentioned that she could wear it during the reception if she preferred not to wear it in the ceremony. It’s a white jade bracelet, and I shared its significance with her.

Now, with the wedding only a few months away, there’s a problem. My daughter has been getting to know my future daughter-in-law, and she recently came to me, saying that my future daughter-in-law thinks the bracelet is ugly and has been complaining about it. She even showed me texts where my future daughter-in-law said some hurtful things about me, calling me a “controlling ass” for giving her the bracelet. This was hurt and it feels like a complete rejection, especially since she knows why it’s important. When I asked my son, he said he didn’t know anything about her feelings on this.

Since she clearly doesn’t want or respect the bracelet, I asked for it back. That’s when things got messy. She made a big deal about how I was excluding her from the family by taking it back.

Now, she’s pissed and calling me a jerk. My son also thinks I’m a jerk for taking it back, even after I showed him what she said.

Last month, she asked me if I could watch them for a weekend while she and her husband went on a short anniversary trip. I agreed because I love my nieces and nephew, but I made it clear that I needed at least two weeks’ notice because I work long hours, and I’d have to rearrange my schedule.

Fast forward to this past week. I asked my boss for time off, cleared my weekend, and stocked my house with everything the kids would need. Friday afternoon rolls around, and I’m waiting for her to drop them off. Suddenly, I get a text from her saying they’re not coming. She decided last minute that they were going to a family-friendly resort instead and didn’t need me to watch them anymore. No apology, just, “We’ll do it another time.”

I was frustrated because I had completely cleared my weekend, turned down plans with friends, and rearranged my work schedule for this. I responded by telling her it wasn’t cool to cancel on me last minute like that, especially when I went out of my way to help.

Then, two days later, she called me again asking if I could watch the kids the following weekend. Apparently, something came up with her original plan, and she needed someone to watch them after all. I told her no, I wasn’t available. She got upset and said I was being selfish and punishing her kids for something that wasn’t their fault.

Now she’s mad at me, and my parents are saying I should be more understanding because “things come up when you’re a parent.” I don’t have kids, but I feel like it’s just basic respect to not cancel on someone last minute and then expect them to be available whenever you want.

35,1getq8m,AITA for not helping my friend when she needed medical assistance?,"*EDITED FOR CLARITY* 

My friend ""Lily"" (38F) and I (26F) became close quickly after meeting six months ago. She’s new in town, works from home, and doesn’t have many friends here. Her partner was out of the country, and Lily texted me yesterday that she felt unwell with severe period cramps and nausea. I left work early to pick up her six-year-old son, got her some meds, and bought groceries, snacks, and easy-to-eat food. She was very distressed, feeling anxious about not being able to care for her son, and she’s a bit of a hypochondriac, which added to her stress.

While at her place, I received bad news that led to an anxiety attack (Lily took care of me and calmed me down). I had plans to meet a friend from another city, but she decided to come to me instead to support me. I also spoke with another friend who was so concerned that he and his girlfriend came to pick me up by car, as I wasn’t in a good state. Just as I was leaving, Lily became more anxious and asked me to stay, but I couldn’t due to my mental state. I did, however, call my sister, a doctor, who advised that Lily was likely fine but could go to the ER if she worsened. I told Lily to call me if she needed to go to the hospital.

My friends drove me home, and I started to panic again in their car. Later, Lily and her partner started calling and texting me, asking me to return. I told them I was really unwell and didn’t feel safe to leave, so I couldn’t go back. I also asked if they had called the medical assistance phone number, but they hadn’t. Her partner dismissed the ER as an option, insisting that they just wanted me to be there with her and her son as her partner was not in the country. Though I understood, I was in no state to help anyone. When I tried to suggest medical help over the phone, Lily cursed at me, said my problems weren’t as bad as hers, and hung up.

In the morning, I apologized to Lily, offered to help take her son to school and pick him up in the afternoon, and reached out to her partner and another friend. However, they haven’t responded, even though Lily has been reading my messages. Now I feel like I’ve lost her as a friend and am being blamed for not being there, as I’m receiving the silent treatment. I’m heartbroken and unsure if I did the right thing.

37,1get2k5,AITA for telling my wife I'm not going to eat ice-cream every night anymore,"So my wife is a big foodie and loves to indulge in a nice dessert every night and 2x on the weekends - think ice-cream or cheesecakes. Luckily, she has always been able to maintain a very low body weight (actually she struggles to not be underweight, more on this later).

  
We have had a habit of eating a dessert every night after dinner and she really enjoys this time, but over the years, I have gained about 10-15kg. This has really caused me to have a lot of frustration with this habit of eating desserts because when I refuse and say I don't want anything today. She guilt trips me into eating with her by saying this like this is her favorite time of the day because this is the only time she gets to enjoy eating.

  
I can understand her point of view because she has had multiple problems with her digestive system and is usually very limited on the food she can eat. We have been to the doctor dozens of times over the years and no one can seem find a diagnosis, but basically, it's IBS, gallbladder problems, acid reflux and other related problems.

  
Because she has had so many problems with her digestive system and has problems, I feel reluctant to bring up my feelings, because I do think she needs to eat some calorie rich food to maintain her weight. But also as an extra note, I am concerned the amount of sugary foods she eats is contributing to some of her digestive issues.

  
For the past year, I have been working out more and trying to keep off the weight, but it hasn't really been working. 

So this evening I told her how I feel about eating desserts every night and she tells me I'm acting like I have body dysmorphia. And if I don't want to eat dessert with her this I can go eat out by myself tomorrow and goes on talking about  why it’s better to live alone. I'm going to call her on her bluff. 

It feels really silly that this is the biggest issues in our marriage..

I want to be in control of what I eat without having a fight every night.

Am I the asshole? 



 Edit 1: Many comments have suggested that she might be bulimic. I know for a fact she doesn’t purge. She keeps a pretty strict diet for her actual “meals” that follows the low FODMAP diet, but has ice cream after every dinner and on the weekend has it after lunch as well.

This has really caused me to have a lot of frustration with this habit of eating desserts because when I refuse and say I don't want anything today. She guilt trips me into eating with her by saying this like this is her favorite time of the day because this is the only time she gets to enjoy eating.

  
I can understand her point of view because she has had multiple problems with her digestive system and is usually very limited on the food she can eat. We have been to the doctor dozens of times over the years and no one can seem find a diagnosis, but basically, it's IBS, gallbladder problems, acid reflux and other related problems.

  
Because she has had so many problems with her digestive system and has problems, I feel reluctant to bring up my feelings, because I do think she needs to eat some calorie rich food to maintain her weight. But also as an extra note, I am concerned the amount of sugary foods she eats is contributing to some of her digestive issues.

  
For the past year, I have been working out more and trying to keep off the weight, but it hasn't really been working. 

So this evening I told her how I feel about eating desserts every night and she tells me I'm acting like I have body dysmorphia. And if I don't want to eat dessert with her this I can go eat out by myself tomorrow and goes on talking about  why it’s better to live alone. I'm going to call her on her bluff. 

It feels really silly that this is the biggest issues in our marriage..

I want to be in control of what I eat without having a fight every night.

Am I the asshole? 



 Edit 1: Many comments have suggested that she might be bulimic. I know for a fact she doesn’t purge. She keeps a pretty strict diet for her actual “meals” that follows the low FODMAP diet, but has ice cream after every dinner and on the weekend has it after lunch as well. ",0.0,0.987317,1,0

39,1gerq01,AITA for having Christmas at home? ,"Hi all. First post here and I suspect first of many. 

Every year, my wife and I have alternated who we go to for Christmas each year, flicking from my parents to hers.  This has always been ok, everyone lives close so no more than a 30 minute drive. 

We now have a 2 1/2 year old and I would like to have Christmas at our house this year. For the last two years, we have taken the Boy to her parents and then mine. So they both had him at least once for Christmas. 

My wife has decided she would like Christmas at her parents this year as they would very much like to see him on Christmas Day. Last year we agreed that would be our last and this year we would have Christmas at ours, just us. 

I really want to do our own thing and make our own traditions but my wife isn't into that at all. In her view we ought to see parents as they won't be around forever (they all range from early to late 70s). In my view, this day in age, people live longer and who knows, they may all live another 10 years.  At which point my Boy will have never had Christmas at ours and will always be dragged away. 

She gets a bit emotional about this and gives me the silent treatment when I say we're having Christmas at home. It's awkward and I just need to know whether I am actually being the asshole. 

Oh, finally, I have said I am happy to have people here Christmas Eve all day to do presents etc. That was received with a mild response so maybe that'll happen.

40,1ger72n,WIBTA if I set boundaries on how I spend my money with my partner because she spends a large portion of her income on drugs while we're struggling with family expenses?,"Throwaway Account  
TW: Drug use

Some context: I’m (M)29, and my partner is (F)31. We’ve been together for around 5 years. Early on, she covered rent, and I handled food. For about 2 years, we earned roughly the same and split family expenses (it was just the two of us then). She found out she was pregnant in March 2023, and in September, her employer didn’t renew her contract, so she went on unemployment benefits. I told her, “Don’t worry, I’ve got this,” and took on most of our expenses.

Drug use has always been part of our lives, but back then, I didn’t see it as an issue. I used to smoke around three times a day myself. Since we had our baby 10 months ago, I’ve cut down to about once a day. She, on the other hand, has ramped up her usage and now spends around 300€ a month on it. I make about 1400€ a month, and she makes around 600€ (180€ of that is government assistance).

I’ve expressed my concerns to her about spending this much, especially since our baby has increased our expenses. But she hasn’t made any changes and told me, “I do what I want with my money.” We don’t have a budget, but her spending impacts us; by halfway through the month, our account is often completely drained, making it hard to cover family needs.

On one hand, I feel I might be in the wrong because I said, “My money is your money,” and I worry that setting financial boundaries now could come off as controlling or unfair. But at the same time, I feel that with our child, we need to be more financially stable. WIBTA?

EDIT1: I see that my original post wasn’t clear enough, so I’d like to clarify a few things:

\- I should have made this clearer. I’m deeply concerned about how her drug use affects her ability to care for our child, and I am taking steps to make sure our child is safe.  
\- Talking about her usage directly has been difficult. I have tried bringing it up before, but she insists she’s “in control.” That’s why I chose to approach things from a financial angle—it's a way to address the issue without getting caught in a cycle of denial or defensiveness, which has happened in past conversations.  
\- Our usage is not the same. I do smoke, but it’s not daily, and I’m actively reducing my own use, especially since our child was born. She, on the other hand, is using harder substances and has increased her usage. I know it’s not ideal for me to use at all, but I’m working to cut back and shift my focus to what’s best for our child.

EDIT2 : I want to sincerely apologize if I offended anyone with my post. I recognize that my focus was misplaced, and I’m waking up late to the reality of our situation. It’s clear that I need to act quickly to ensure my child’s safety, and I appreciate the urgency of these concerns.

41,1geqyts,AITA for refusing to go away during my time off over Christmas ,"My workplace shuts down between Christmas Eve and New Year’s Day, so I get that time off automatically. I also put in annual leave for the 2nd and 3rd of January, which means I’ll be off from the 24th of December to the 6th of January. My girlfriend’s off between Christmas and New Year as well and is thinking of taking the 2nd and 3rd as holiday too.

I’ve got three exams in December, so I’m looking forward to finally being able to relax a bit over the break. Leading up to the exams, I barely have time for my hobbies—no reading, no video games, and no time to catch up on TV shows. I still make it to the gym before work and go out for dinners with my girlfriend, but otherwise, I’m full-on with studying when I'm not at work. 

There are a few video games coming out before Christmas that I’m planning on picking up and playing over the holiday. My girlfriend and I will be spending Christmas with our own families and meeting back up between Boxing Day and the New Year—we’ve planned a day out on the 27th and have a dinner booked for New Year’s Eve.

Recently, my girlfriend mentioned wanting to go away for 3–4 nights during our time off, either somewhere in the UK or abroad. I told her I’d be completely burnt out and was really just looking forward to staying in and unwinding for a few days. I said I’d be more up for a trip towards the end of January or even February. She said it would be better to go over Christmas since we’re both off already, but I told her again that I’d need a few days to just relax.

She thinks I’m being unfair and should make the most of the time off, but honestly, “making the most of it” to me means taking the chance to recover and recharge after the stress of exams. She then asked what about her so I suggested she could go solo or take a friend along if she’d rather go over Christmas.

She says she only wants to go if it’s with me, but I pointed out again that a January or February trip is a good compromise—I’d just rather go when I’m not so exhausted and can actually enjoy it. I tried to explain that this time off is something I’m really counting on to just relax and catch up on things I haven’t had a chance to enjoy for ages.

She’s said I’m wrong for not properly considering her side or being willing to compromise, but I think I have offered a decent middle ground. It just feels like she’s not willing to meet me there.

42,1geqd7j,AITA for planning to visit my best friend to meet her baby ,"In November myself and a group of my life long friends are planning to go on a trip to visit one of my best friends who has just had a baby. 
To give context of the group dynamics of the people who are going, it’s me (27F), my older brother, my female friend and her husband, the husbands little brother (much younger than myself) and my other female friend. Now to give context I have known this group of people nearly my whole life and love and trust them dearly, as well as hanging out with them nearly every week. For this weekend we have booked a cottage where everyone has their own rooms and are planning to surprise my friend (who’s just had a baby). So we have planned this with her husband and she has no idea we are coming (bare in mind she has been asking me to see and visit her baby for a few months now and I’m sensing she’s getting upset that I haven’t yet). The weekend is planned to be a chilled weekend (no drinking) mainly walks and board game nights/dinner. Now, upon inviting my boyfriend (27M) (as I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for him to meet most of my best friends at once) we have had a massive argument as he is not happy for me to stay in the cottage as there will be other men there. He said he doesn’t care if the men are married, gay, bisexual or asexual he is not happy with the arrangement. I argued that my brother is present, and the other is married and will be sharing a room with his wife (one of my best friends) and the other is significantly younger than me. He is aware that I hang out with these people very often however he argues that even if I have known these men my whole life and have formed friendships with them they could still be a danger to me and I should therefore either cancel the trip or find another accommodation. I have now agreed to cancel the trip (which he doesn’t seem to care about) if I don’t find an accommodation on my own but I am very resentful about the situation and don’t think I should have to, but I am compromising because I love him. During the argument he gave me an ultimatum to suggest that if I go ahead without changing the circumstances of the accommodation he would break up with me. I will find it so awkward to explain to my friends why I am staying at a separate accommodation to everyone while everyone is having this weekend away. I even offered for him to meet the group before the weekend away as he can’t make it, he said it won’t make a difference to the situation. To add to this, this weekend, my boyfriend can’t make it as he is going to his friend (who’s a female) birthday party, where there will be other females who I don’t know and he doesn’t know and there will be alcohol and possibly more.

Total was roughly, $700 each. Note that she lives in a different state to me (Australia). I recommended she buy flights asap, or as soon as they come up on sale but regardless, flights from her state to mine aren't v expensive. You can easily get flights for >$200 return, even less on sale.

December last year, she decided to quit her well paying job. I again recommended getting flights before she no longer had a income. Instead, she got a kitten.

I sent her a message a few weeks before the event checking on her travel plans. She still hadn't bought flights & was conflicted about attending because of her kitten.

It comes to the week of & I'd been calling her daily to see if she'd made a decision. Its only TWO DAYS before the start of the festival that she conclusively says she won't be attending. She also specifically said, “Do you have anyone that would take my ticket?”

Unfortunately, no one else in my life enjoys this genre of music. I also am not safely able to attend a 3 day festival solo due to serious medical conditions.

Once she said she wasn't coming, I immediately listed both our tickets on the official resale website, as well as, 2 other resale sites. The festival was sold out, so I was hopeful that they would be sold but unfortunately there were hundreds of other tickets up for sale. I even saw some listed for as low as $67. I had exactly 1 enquiry about the tickets, which lead nowhere.

Regardless, I waited until the Thursday night before I packed my campervan and got ready for the festival & still even left the tickets up until we were driving to the festival. I managed to convince my bf to come with me, despite him disliking the genre immensely.

After the festival, my friend asked me when I was going to pay her for the ticket.

Her argument is that my bf used the ticket so either him or I should pay. My counter argument was that:

1 She bailed last minute.

2. I tried to sell the tickets but they didn't sell.

3. She knew it wasn't safe for me to attend solo, leaving me the options of waste both tickets or pay for both, which I can't afford.

4. She had said to me “Do you have anyone that can take my ticket” which to me meant the ticket was on offer for anyone available to go with me.

5. I don't believe my bf should have to pay either as he was attending only as a favour to me.

Everyone I've spoken to agree I'm in the right. She said that she spoke to people that believe that I should pay the full amount of the ticket, but I wonder if she actually provided the full story.

I (20 F )am a college student, work part-time, do after-school activities for my degree and I do not eat at home due to lack of food, as my parents spend money on junk food instead. I stopped giving money for food as it was not used to buy meals. during the summer I have been staying at my grandmother's house where I can eat my food so I buy my own there and help with chores. My parents berate me for not contributing financially or doing chores at home, despite my absence for several months. I tried to explain to them that I could not afford to support the family (parents and 3 siblings) and my own needs. I also know it's not really about the chores because I was never taught by my mother ""her way of doing them"" because of my mother's OCD. We physically aren't allowed to do the chores. but that's a problem because my mom doesn't do them either even though she is ""the only one who can do it right"" and a SAHM.

Edit for title: Financial\*",Not the A-hole,2024-10-29,"AITA for not picking up my parents finical slack? My parents are struggling financially, mainly because my mother refuses to work due to a knee issue and spends her time on Facebook. My mother also would never be able to survive a real job because she goes off the handle if you even imply she is incorrect in any way. I (20 F )am a college student, work part-time, do after-school activities for my degree and I do not eat at home due to lack of food, as my parents spend money on junk food instead. I stopped giving money for food as it was not used to buy meals. during the summer I have been staying at my grandmother's house where I can eat my food so I buy my own there and help with chores. My parents berate me for not contributing financially or doing chores at home, despite my absence for several months. I tried to explain to them that I could not afford to support the family (parents and 3 siblings) and my own needs. I also know it's not really about the chores because I was never taught by my mother ""her way of doing them"" because of my mother's OCD. We physically aren't allowed to do the chores. but that's a problem because my mom doesn't do them either even though she is ""the only one who can do it right"" and a SAHM.

45,1gepoq1,AITA for standing up for my Mom n sister against my husband and in laws?,"I come from a family of 3 including my mom and my little sis. I lost my Dad when I was 10 and my mom single handedly did her very best to make everything seem as if Dad were still around.She never had support from relatives and obviously made countless sacrifices as we were growing up.

I got married in 2022 and moved to NZ.As soon as we got married, my in laws spun into action by making me convert all my bank accounts into joint accounts with my husband. At the time, their reason was that it would be beneficial for my move to NZ. I constantly turned a blind eye giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Enter husband. The red flags started popping up immediately after our wedding. His total lack of compassion is mind boggling. I used to tell myself maybe he's just shy. I used to get depressed constantly, but I told myself that I'm stuck with this now and maybe I'm the one who needs an attitude change.

So the latest issue began when my mom told me over the phone that she would really like to visit Turkey with one of her friends. My husband who was attending the call with me just stormed off, making the whole thing really odd. He then started arguing with me that I should make her understand that going on expensive international trips at this time is a bad idea, she should be saving money for my sister when she needs to get married. Truth be told, even I thought it was a bad idea at the time since mom just travelled to Singapore this year. But I brushed off his concerns saying that even if I am to object, she wouldn't listen to me and would end up in an argument. Besides, the trip wasn't confirmed at all. We ended up not speaking that whole weekend. I finally lost it and started pushing his buttons to know why exactly he's so concerned about this and ultimately it slipped from his mouth - He doesn't want my Mom to approach us for money after she spends all of hers. I told him it's none of his business what my mom chooses to do with her money and she's never approached us for help. Even if she does, it's my responsibility and I will not abandon my family. My Mom's getting older and has the fomo about not being able to travel and see beautiful places. Things escalated pretty quickly after that and my in laws got involved. I work a good job and is single handedly putting my husband through college. If I ever mention even in the slightest way about me being the breadwinner, they turn the whole thing against me.This is the first time I raised my voice against them because I understood that they really look down on me and my family.Everything's come crashing down on me to a point that even the things I do on a daily basis while maintaining a busy schedule are at fault. It seems like they want me to cast out my side of the family completely.   I'm not totally a saint here. I should have controlled my emotions better.

My girlfriend Lana started talking about 3 days ago about how she has had so much trouble focusing on her studies lately that she might possibly have undiagnosed ADHD and that she should go get tested. Earlier today while Lana and I were out with her mother I was trying to answer some questions that Lana's mom was asking us and Lana kept interrupting me while I was talking. After 2 or 3 times of her interrupting me I sighed and did an exaggerated pause after she was done talking. She was a bit upset that I made a scene in front of her mother and I agree that I was partially out of line there. 
Fast forward to tonight while we're getting ready for bed she apologizes for interrupting me earlier and that she thinks it's because of the ADHD. I laughed and told her not to self diagnose just yet, and she tells me it's okay because she is almost 100% sure that she has it. I told her that, while I'm not saying she doesn't have it, it's not impossible that she may not have it. She then began getting really upset with me for saying that ""It was all in her head and that she was making it up."" I then told her I didn't say that and repeated exactly what I said from above again. Here I said something I might regret. I told her that I might be upset if she didn't take back what she said. She then remembered and sort of apologized. A few minutes later I asked her why she made those things up about me just now (I realize now that I could have phrased this better). She got really mad at me for ""accusing her"" and that she didn't make anything up. I said I was sorry for phrasing it like that but I wasn't okay with her speaking to me like that and then just going to bed like nothing happened and that I didn't want to let her walk all over me this time (I regret this part as well). She told me I was making her out to be the villain, to which I responded that she was making ME the villain. Then, Lana said ""I mean, If you want me to go sleep in the other room I will but I don't think either of us did anything wrong.""

About a year ago we found a gal and she was great. Dogs loved her and we used her 2 times. Never had any issues except her cancelling on us twice, two hours before we left for our trips. We get it though, things happen and we didn’t hold it against her. We just made sure to have my brother as back up in case she cancelled. Anyway, we left for Mexico and we have a ring camera on our front door. She knows this and she’s also house sitting and spending the night. Not just drop ins. We have three dogs, well behaved but my dogs need to wear wraps on their bellies because they are old and sometimes pee in the house. They are never on longer than a few hours and they are totally comfortable in them. We specified on rover that we would like them taken out every 2-3 hours but if she need to leave, but they can be alone for about 8 hours. At 11pm, we noticed that she left at 10am but never returned. For the record, we aren’t snooping or spying, we just get notified. So my wife checked and she hadn’t been back all day. We called her and she said “oh I came back at 12 and let them out.” Two things here, no she didn’t. There was nothing on the ring so she’s lying and even if it were true, that’s still 12 hours of her not letting them out or feeding them. We asked her to leave our house immediately and that we will be contacting rover to make sure she doesn’t watch dogs again. I genuinely cannot understand leaving dogs for that long. We called my father in law and he was able to drive an hour over to let them out and is watching them. He said they are their food in 30 seconds when it typically takes them 3-4 minutes. Idk if she even fed them, but that’s projection cause I’m angry. Were we too harsh telling her to leave? I just couldn’t trust her and sleep knowing she’s taking care of them.

52,1geof7q,AITA for telling my girlfriend she needs to start driving her self to places?,"So my (24m) GF (26f) and I have been together a year and a half now. She is from Thailand, she drove an automatic car there (learnt in a manual though so has a manual license here) 

She doesn’t own a car here. We only have my car and I have told her she can use it whenever… but she won’t. However, I’ve managed to start getting her to driver her self to work (it is only 4 minutes from our home). We live in a city. 

However, anywhere further than that, and she just won’t do it. Says it’s too far to drive her self. I’ve been to Thailand, and the driving situation where she is from is far scarier (obviously in my opinion) than here 

However, we have my mother here at the moment visiting, and she has told me that I need to tell my GF to start driving her self to places where I am not needed - hair appointment, dentist, work etc etc because in our relationship we need to ‘start as we mean to go on’ which I think is fair. 

So my GF has a dentist appointment tonight which is a 25 minute drive from our apartment (she could have picked a dentist closer but this one was recommended to her by her boss) 
I have been at work today. She went to uni this morning for a few hours then has been at her mates since early afternoon. 

So I told her that she needs to drive her self and that I am sorry, but I don’t want to be running around after her our whole lives when she is more than capable of driving. 

She is now mad at me.

53,1geocga,WIBTA if I left my on-campus apartment?,"Throwaway since one of my roomies knows my reddit.

I (20f) and my 3 friends (~20f) are all juniors in college who share an on-campus apartment. The last 2 years I have had single dorm rooms due to my social anxiety but I got to know these 3 girls well the past 2 years and even though I was nervous, I thought they'd be great to live with. And they were. Until recently. 
My school has a thing where seniors aren't allowed to live on campus, we have to get off-campus housing to help us prepare for living on our own, but the school will help us figure out rent and stuff. My roomies haven't talked about it at all but I've heard enough from others who already have their housing that I decide to be the one to bring it up with them. I want to get a good and affordable apartment early, after all, and people are snatching them up. This is especially important since one of my roomies is from a low-income family. 

Well, it turns out that they already got an apartment...3 weeks ago. For 3 people, myself not included. When I asked why I wouldn't have been included in this, one of them said ""I thought you already had a place"" which makes no sense because I had not once talked about housing and I also have no other friends in my grade, they're all seniors. 
While I thought I was good friends with these three, they *do* hang out a lot without me - not as intentional exclusion, but they're all morning people who go out for breakfast together every day, while I sleep in and don't eat breakfast. They seem to have all gotten closer to each other during this time, leaving me behind, which isn't any of our faults in and of itself, but I know the housing discussion must have all happened during breakfasts. And they just...never told me or even asked. 

I have no idea what to do about next year. I can't live with strangers due to my anxiety and if there's no place I can afford I am worried I'll have to transfer schools. I'm hoping they can make a disability accommodation for me, my anxiety is an actual disability and is the reason I was guaranteed a single room the past 2 years. 

Things have been...awkward with my roomies for the past few days and I'm starting to feel a lot less comfortable living with them. I'd really like to switch rooms when the semester is over and go back to a single dorm like I have had in the past. 

But I have two worries about that. If I leave, there are two options.
 
1) the 3 girls' housing cost goes up because they still have to pay for a 4-person apartment, and like I said earlier, one is from a low-income family and can already barely afford college. 

2) they get a new roomie to replace me. one of the other girls is very much like me, with really bad social anxiety and while she has a few other friends in our grade, it's unlikely that she could get one of them and she could also not handle having a random person as a roomie. 

So, WIBTA if I switched rooms for the new semester, even if it meant majorly screwing over one of my roomies?

54,1geo5pf,WIBTA for moving out?,"On mobile so I'm sorry for any format issues. I've changed the names for this story due to this being a throwaway account.

I'm 23 male, I have a roommate who we will name Alice for this story. She is 22 female. For some background, we have been living together for almost 4 years now. I would also like to note that we both struggle with mental health. I am on antidepressants and go to therapy. Alice has stopped going to therapy and will give me excuses as to why she isn't going anymore. She is on mood stabilizers and will stop taking them without telling me or her long distance boyfriend. While I do understand that with mood stabilizers people tend to feel this way and will stop taking them. I wish she would talk to either of us about it so we are aware. I've always tried to be supportive but recently I can't anymore.

I had a friend who was going through a tough time and I had asked Alice if it would be ok if said friend stayed for a while. Alice seemed ok with it. However, she said that ""said friend would have to be ok with us being messy"". That's when I started noticing all of her behavior. I will admit, I might not be the cleanest person but I keep it all to my room. While Alice's stuff spills out into the Common areas. I've tried talking to her about it but nothing changes. This is when I noticed the pattern of us being ok for a while and then her not doing her meds and our relationship going downhill. I've reached my breaking point. I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells at home. Everything happened a few months after we had just renewed our lease. I've tried to talk to her about how I feel but she ends up blowing up at or ignoring me.

I can't have people over without her permission even though we both pay the rent. I've been out of a relationship since we moved in together due to me having a nasty relationship before we moved in. Well, I was talking with a guy and he can't come over unless she has met him. I've tried a few times to arrange a time to when they can met but she always gives me excuses. 

Recently her boyfriend flew in. I like her boyfriend, he helps around the apartment,ect. Well they went away for the weekend and she told me this ""Hey I'm going to give you a pass this one time if you want that guy to come over while we are gone, without me having to met him"". It just left a sour taste in my mouth.

She can't seem to be ok with me being happy. Whenever I've tried to talk to her about how I'm getting better with relationships and notice red flags,ect. she just blows me off. She will bring up past mistakes I've made which is uncalled for.

I don't know what to think anymore. If I move out or leave then I don't know what she will do. I'm one of her only friends and her boyfriend lives out of state. She has a rocky relationship with her dad (mom isn't around) and if I leave then she would probably have to move back in with him.

55,1geo3bg,AITA for 'calling his family animals',"My partner and I have been living together for about a year. I have a pet who is old but very well behaved and without many accidents around the house. This is probably the last year she'll be around, so I have asked him to please treat her with a lot of love and attention because she is my whole heart. She was an unexpected rescue who had had a hard life before me and I made a promise to give her the best life I can when I found her. I have gone to many extremes for my pet and would make the same decisions every time. I don't have kids or another responsibility like kids in my life, so I don't feel like setting her as my priority in life is wrong, as I am the only person she has. My boyfriend initially accepted this responsibility but he doesn't feel like giving her love and respect is important, just feeding her pretty much. She really loves him though and it breaks my heart to see her try to get his attention, nudge his hand, fall over (bc she old) trying to reach his height, etc, only for him to ignore her. He also eats her favorite snacks in front of her and doesn't share even though the scent has turned her into a hurricane of desire. For this particular kind of pet, these attitudes are really detrimental. 

The problem is that when I see something that is particularly hurtful and hard to watch, I try to tell him about it and since I have no other points of comparison for him since he doesn't love animals, I inevitably fall into a trap of asking him if he would like for me to treat his family the same way. (I.e. Would you like it if I shut the door in your brother's face when he was trying to get my attention or talk to me? How would you feel if you saw your mom falling over a chair just to talk to me and I just ignored her?) This is incredibly offensive to him and he cannot understand my point at all. He thinks I am saying that his family is animals, I guess, but I have a difficult time understanding why he can't understand that I am just trying to put him into my shoes, even though the comparison isn't perfect obviously. 

In my opinion, if he told me that an insect was the most important responsibility in his life I would treat it as such. If he told me that a plant was the most important responsibility in his life and that I spend an hour a day blowing my CO2 on it, I would do it. And if he compared me ignoring his plant to ignoring my pet, I wouldn't get offended or say one has nothing to do with the other. I would just do it and understand that he has a certain love for a living thing that I cannot understand, but I would spend the time, dedication and intention that he asked me to.

V and I don’t have the best relationship but he gets along great with the younger kids and they love staying at his place. I don’t have a problem with them visiting him as long as either D or E are there to supervise.

Yesterday, I picked them up from V’s place. When I got there, there was another boy. I thought he was a friend of E so I offered him a ride home but he declined and said that he lived there.

Before we left I asked V why he had a random teenager living with him. He told me that the boy was his girlfriend’s nephew.

He’s not though. I didn’t say anything at the time because I didn’t want to start a fight but I know that his girlfriend doesn’t have any siblings.

When we got home I told them that I didn’t want them to visit V for a while which caused a huge fight and now the younger 2 won’t talk to me and E has threatened to run away because I’m such a bitch.

D doesn’t really care because he only really came along to supervise the younger ones but when I asked him about the other kid he said he didn’t know him but that he definitely wasn’t his girlfriend’s nephew.

I’m not sure if I may have overreacted because of the complicated relationship I have with V. After having slept on this, I’d really appreciate an outsider’s opinion. Also, you may have noticed that I’m not a native english speaker, so please let me know if there’s anything unclear.

Over the last month or so she has been feeding it and it's becoming more well acquainted with the surroundings.

I have never had a cat before, so I was excited about starting with a kitten for my first one, she on the other hand has had multiple growing up. Some other information is that there are multiple stray cats in the area, we don't know where the cat came from, it isn't fixed, and has a minor temperament (it hisses a little bit sometimes and swats a little). Just wanted to hear some other opinions on the matter, because my girlfriend's sister and mom seem to think that I should want the cat.

When I was there one day, we saw a cat in the backyard, we aren't sure how old it is, but we are assuming it's a few years old. Over the last month or so she has been feeding it and it's becoming more well acquainted with the surroundings. At this point, I can tell that she wants to take in the cat, but I am not really for the idea. I have never had a cat before, so I was excited about starting with a kitten for my first one, she on the other hand has had multiple growing up. Some other information is that there are multiple stray cats in the area, we don't know where the cat came from, it isn't fixed, and has a minor temperament (it hisses a little bit sometimes and swats a little). Just wanted to hear some other opinions on the matter, because my girlfriend's sister and mom seem to think that I should want the cat.

  
Edit: I worded the post poorly to make it seem like she asked me if I she could take in the cat and I said no, but this was not the case, I ultimately told her that the decision is hers.",1.0,1.0555149,1,1

We are all 18M, just started college this year, with us split up into different schools for the first in over a decade. We have celebrated all of our 18th birthdays together this year. Five of us have already celebrated our bdays, with the last one, my friend Shaun, having his birthday this week. 

originally we were all going to meet at one of the other guys' college for the weekend to go to a concert that was happening there, however the show has been postponed. Shaun now has another concert he wants us to go to, that's in his college town. here's the thing, Shaun now attends what was previously my top choice college. I wanted to go there since I was like 14. I visited it twice for tours. it was my dream school, and I didn't get in. I was crushed, and still am. I am learning to enjoy the college I do attend, I have met some cool people already, I like my professors, I am certain I will enjoy my four years here; but there's a large piece of me right now that still wishes I was attending the college that I didn't get into. 

the rejection was hard to take. Shaun knew it was my top choice, and he did his best to support me when results came out, but I was also very cognizant that I didn't want to take away from his joy and the success he deserves to celebrate, so I mostly hid how upset I was. but I was/am devastated, to lose a dream I had for so long. if I go to concert we'd be staying in a hotel that right off the college campus, which I'm sure we'd end up visiting or doing something in, and honestly I just do not want to visit the college yet. truthfully I am still in my feelings, I am still sad not to be attending. 

I am thinking of backing out, and trying to come up with an excuse about why I don't want to go (although it will be hard since Shaun already knows I have the weekend free, since I was suppose to be attending the other concert). However, I worry this would be an asshole move, because we have really made a big deal of celebrating each other's birthdays this year, and my absence would make me only guy in the group to miss any birthday event. we also promised that even though Shaun's birthday was once we had all started our new schools, we would still meet up to celebrate him for his birthday ike he did everyone else's before him. but I really don't want to walk on that campus yet.

AITA for being mad at my husband for making fun of my appearance?

Hi everyone, I’m honestly feeling pretty hurt and unsure if I’m overreacting, so I thought I’d ask here.

My husband has a habit of making comments about my appearance that feel hurtful. It started with little things, like touching my forehead and pretending to measure it, saying I have the biggest forehead he’s ever seen. I’ve seen him make fun of other people for this before, calling a girl “the ugliest of them all” because of her forehead, so it really stings when he says that to me.

There have been other comments, too. When I had a pimple, he looked at me disgustedly and asked when it was finally going away because “I’ve had it for a long time.” Another time, as I walked away, he made a comment about how flat my butt was. Yesterday was the last straw for me: I was telling him about some issues I’ve been having with my period, spotting outside my normal cycle, and he picked up my feet and, once we finished talking, said they looked like “hooves.” When I got upset, he brushed it off, saying I was only mad because i was on my period.

I’ve told him repeatedly that these comments make me feel insecure and hurt, and I’ve asked him to stop. But he keeps doing it. AITA for being angry about this, or am I overreacting?

","I was best friends with someone (let's call them Tay) for a long time. I met Riley, Tay’s now ex, through Tay and some mutual classes we all had. Tay and Riley dated, but ended up breaking up for reasons Tay did not want to tell me. Riley and I ended up falling for each other. Riley eventually wanted to date, (we were currently “talking”), but I refused until a few more months passed, when we would end up going to a different school than Tay because of our differing career paths. Riley and I intended on never telling my friend Tay that we were talking, or that we liked each other, so Tay would not be hurt. When we moved schools, we could date freely, so for now, our friend groups also agreed on keeping this a secret from Tay. I did care a lot about Tay, but I could not help my feelings for Riley. Due to an incident that happened with Riley, I decided to distance myself from Riley, but Tay did find out somehow about us, but never told me how. Tay forgave me, and we decided to put what happened past ourselves, and remained friends. 



Some time passed, and I met someone else that had gotten to know Tay through mutual friends. Let’s call this person Heat. Soon enough I realized that Heat and Tay seemed to be on a talking stage, romantically, though Tay also ended up cutting things off with Heat eventually. With no idea why this happened, I began to get to know Heat more. After months of being friends, I fell for Heat, and Heat seemed mutually interested, seeming to have finally gotten over Tay. We began to flirt more, talk more, and I began to feel like I did with Riley. I thought that maybe, this time, things would work. One day, Heat and I got into an argument over something stupid, but it got to the point where Heat snapped. “I KNOW what you did to Tay in the past. They told me you and their ex were romantically involved, and when they asked you about it you lied several times. You're a horrible person and you have no right to be yelling at me for something stupid when you have done worse.” Heat yelled. I was shocked. I cut off contact with Heat. I was also very mad at Tay for telling Heat what I had done. I know they had gotten close at one point, but why did Tay have to talk about something that was supposed to be in the past?

69,1gek68m,AITA for suggesting we spend Christmas at home rather than with family of family on a farm ,"Background: my wife and I have been together for 11 years, we moved from the UK to Australia 8 years ago, married 7 years ago, and have two kids aged 5 and 3. I am British, she is Australian, we moved Down Under mainly for her to be closer to her family but also because we thought it would be a nicer place to raise a family. Both of her parents have passed away, she has 2 sisters (with partners and kids) within a 20 minute drive who we see regularly, probably 2 or 3 times a month. Our marriage has had some ups and downs but we’re tried to work through things and I’ve spent a lot of time with her family (who I get on well with)
 
The issue we’re having is that we disagree on where to spend much of Christmas 2024. My wife would like to spend the morning at home with our family of 4, then at about 11am we’d drive for 2+ hours to her sister’s husband’s parent’s house because that is where both of her sisters will be. We’d spend the whole of the afternoon and evening there, before sleeping in a tent outside because there isn’t enough room in the house (there must be 20+ people attending including all of my brother-in-law’s family and their families).
 
I would like to spend the whole day at our own house and in our own home with the 4 of us, having our own intimate Christmas, rather than spending much of it driving and at my sister-in-law’s husband’s parent’s house. We did this years ago and I felt like an outsider, gatecrashing another family’s day (even though they were happy to have us).
 
In the 8 years that we have been in Australia, we have flown back to the UK once to spend it with my family out there. My mother has also flown out here once to be with me and her grandkids. On the other 7 occasions in Australia, so 7 times out of 8, we have spent lunch and the afternoon with all of her family, sisters, in-laws, their kids, aunties and uncles etc. This has either been at their houses down the road, hosted at our house, or that one time we went to the place which is being discussed.
 
I tried to compromise by saying that although I don’t want to spend some of Christmas in a car and with many people who we barely know, I’d rather spend it at home, why don’t we go there on the 26th or host a lunch the week before, or both. My wife doesn’t like any of these ideas and is upset, saying that I would be stopping her from being with her sisters, the kids would have fun being around their cousins, that I shouldn’t just get to decide and that I’m making this all about me.
 
Moving to the other side of the world, spending almost every Christmas with them, and seeing them all the time isn’t stopping her from seeing her sisters. I think it’s the opposite. Clearly we see Christmas very differently, but this year I would just like to spend the day with my immediate family and really have maximum special times with our kids, before next year we return to the usual rotation.

70,1gek4lm,AITA For Going Forward with Picking out my GF’s Ring?,"I(24m) and my gf K(22f) have been dating for 3 years. We’ve discussed a future and planned out our timeline of our engagement and marriage. We agreed on our engagement to be before the end of the year. Unfortunately due to both her and I being military and being apart for half the year and only recently returning to our home state in August made things difficult. Fortunately I was able to do the right thing and get her parents blessings and then soon go ring shopping with K’s mom (D) and sister (A). We went to a big jewelry shop where we’re able to order the perfect engagement band for K. The ring would take about 2 weeks to get to the store. Last week the ring came in and I asked D and A if we could see the ring together on Saturday 10/25, as K won’t be home. A was working that day and wouldn’t be able to go, so it would be just me and D. I thought I had communicated that though I’d prefer if all three of us could go together, I wouldn’t mind if it were me and D. However,I found out that D and A didn’t know we still had planned to go. The miscommunication is my fault and I accept that I should of verified first long before the day in question. D asked if we could reschedule, but I didn’t want to potentially reschedule and push my plans back another week/month trying to coordinate with 3 different schedules. I have 2 months left to plan something and I imagined I’d be cutting it pretty close. So with that in mind I respectfully told D that tho I take responsibility for the miscommunication, I really can’t push my timeline anymore than I already have. Needless to say D was not pleased and told me “whatever, do what you want”. I backtracked and said I could just look at the band and buy the diamond and ask the jeweler to hold onto them until we all came together during the weekday after work to see it. She then proceeded to tell me “I don’t want to talk to you rn”. So at a loss as to what to do I went forward with my plans. I sent a text message to the both of them apologizing for the miscommunication and the hurt I caused. That I wanted to make it up to them and if there was anything I could do to make things right so we could continue with the remaining plans and make sure K has a wonderful proposal. Her mom responded by telling me, that I hurt their feelings, that even tho they were upset I decided to continue anyway. She said that there’s no moving forward from this and that I ruined it for her, that it breaks her heart that K probably won’t have a wonderful memory of her proposal, but that’s on me because I ruined it and I’ll have to live the rest of my life knowing that. Good luck with the proposal, I hope it's everything you selfishly hoped it would be. Needless to say I felt absolutely shitty for taking that part of the ring picking away from them. And looking back on it, I probably could have worked something out if I chose to reschedule. I’m not sure what to do next. So Reddit AITA? 

Hey all. Appreciate all the comments and insight. For clarification, I invited both D and A to be involved in picking out the ring, because I wanted to and knew it would be important to K and I. I already knew what K would want for the ring and when I went to go see that ring I knew immediately that she would love it. I didn’t really need D or A’s help too much just their thoughts and opinions, but that ultimately it was going to be my choice. K isn’t as dramatic as her mother and honestly is much more reasonable. She and I both know that her mother can be dramatic when wronged and I’m thinking that’s the case here. I tried my best to make this a smooth engagement as possible, but now I feel like I shot myself in the foot for wronging D and now it’s gonna be an uphill battle to make amends and move forward.

She doesn't seem to like any of my family so we are actually happy as it was starting to affect their 3 year old where if she was at my house and anyone was screaming or arguing she would cover her ears and climb under the dining table. So yes we don't want them back together. They have an 8 month old and the 3 year old. The 3 year old has just been diagnosed with Leukaemia. I have been trying to help with both kids with them sleeping at mine or sometimes me in the hospital with the 3 year old.

I met her down in the lobby for coffee where she then started to tell me the story about how her mother and sister-in-law came to her in tears last night claiming that my boyfriend and I verbally attacked them and called them a b!tch and a c_^t for not helping. This never happened. She walked away and went straight to her wife and did not talk to me the rest of the time I was there even though I tried to talk to her multiple times. 
It has been 3 years and I have not talked to my sister since the morning after her wedding.
Anyways back to why I might be an asshole….. I was talking to my mother about my hypothetical wedding party and the friends that I want in it. She then proceeded to get upset that I don’t have my sisters in the wedding party. I told her i just want my friends and that’s it, no siblings. Am I the asshole?",0.0,0.007950993,0,1
75,1gejlaw,AITA for telling my dad I don't want him to walk me down the aisle?,"I know this is very far away and maybe I'll change my mind but I genuinely don't think I will. 

I (16f) recently went to my uncle's wedding and it got me thinking about my own wedding and what I would do. 


I thought about who was walking me down the aisle and in my mind I decided that I would really like my mom to do it. 


Anyways, a few days ago I told my mom that I already had some of the things I would like in my wedding planned even tho it's very far away. 
And one of those things was for her to walk me down the aisle. Now I told this to her in the kitchen, I didn't know my dad was in the diner listening to my conversation and he overheard this and got upset and asked me why I don't want him to walk me down the aisle. 


I have a whole [post that explains some of the things he does](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/MvtnHQvikE) that might give you an insight to why I would rather have my mom walk me down the aisle. 

I told him that while I do love him, and of course he will be at my wedding, the person who walks you down the aisle is supposed to be the person who was there for you, who took care of you, who loved you the most and protected you, and is now ""setting you free"" to another person to start your new family with another person you love, and that person is my mom, she has always looked out for me, she always wants to be spending time with me, she always takes care of me, she has conversations with me, she asked me about my day, she knows me, which is specially important to me because for example, my dad knows that maybe I like some music, like for example my favorite band is my chemical romance, but not because he has asked me;
 he knows it because I blast it at full volume in my Alexa. 

But he doesn't know my friends, doesn't know about things that happened to me with them, that happened to them in school; because he doesn't ask how my day was, he doesn't ask if something happened, he doesn't ask anything, anyways, the whole explanation is in my other post 

So I think I would really like my mom to walk me down the aisle because she is the person who has looked out for me my whole life, but now I'm feeling a little bad that I told him to his face that I would rather have my mom with me down the aisle even though he has many things to me.

76,1gejki4,AITA for not caring for husband?,"Throwaway 
For context: I am 31 weeks pregnant very high risk and within the same day (2am) of him deceloping a cold I left the hospital because I was in a hypertensive crisis earlier and was on the fence of being induced by the Dr for pre-eclampsia signs. My husband (32M) was at the hospital at the beginning but had to take our kid home and came back to pick me up once I was cleared. 

Here's the issue: after not alot of sleep , still woke up to take our kid to school, noticed he was still home and he told me he was not feeling well(sore throat, congestion etc) I made him some  breakfast and hot tea and took my kid to school. I came home and took my first round of meds and went back to sleep. I woke up around noon, still not feeling to great so I  ate took my second round of meds checked to see if he had a fever while sleeping  and picked up the kitchen a bit. Around 230pm I woke him up and asked him if he could take me to pick up our kid and pick up more meds (if I have the option to not drive it's easier then to  drive because my belly hits the steering wheel and is uncomfortable) and that he should drink some water and eat something. He agrees but looks visibly upset and continues to look upset throughout the time.

We get home I ask him what's wrong and he says ""I do not care about him because I couldn't even get him water when he was sick"" I am confused because I'm still trying to take care of myself after the hospital, so i told him i can only do  what I could do in the mean time (make breakfast while he was awake ) I asked if he wanted any other help and said he'd do it on his own because once again I do not care. At this point I'm getting upset because he knows the issues I've been having and realistically I dont want to risk getting sick myself,  but he said it wasn't a issue since we rode in the car together (fully masked). He then began yelling at me that I never return the same amount of care for something as simple as waking him up to take meds and give him water.

I'm confused on if I AITA or not because if circumstances were different I wouldn't mind taking more care but I'm just not physically or in the mental space to keep taking care for others while my health in pregnancy is declining. I feel bad that he has a cold but even the arguing raised my blood pressure to almost the point of having to go back to the hospital.

78,1gej3e6,AITA for giving a both or neither ultimatum to my MIL for taking my two kids trick-or-treating?,"So my eldest kid, Henry (7), has been talking a lot about halloween. He's really keen and wants to go trick or treating. However, we live in Australia and it's just not really a thing here, at least where I am. I haven't seen a single decoration in our suburb. All I *have* seen is a few signs expressing outright hostility towards it because it's ""un-Australian"", which is just an eyeroll from me. I'm not personally against it, and every year I buy a bag of lollies just in case. But in 5 years of living here I've had no takers. 

So I've been telling Henry sorry but no. I mentioned offhandedly to my mother-in-law, Mary, how keen Henry is. She says my sister-in-law, Sally, is taking her son Aaron (4) because there's a lot of places around them that actually do do halloween. Before I could object, Mary spoke to Sally and asked her to take Henry too. Sally agreed. 

Now, I know if Henry goes but not my other kid, Noah (5), Noah will be super upset that he's missing out (he's also an absolute sugar gremlin). So I ask Mary if it would be asking too much for Noah to go too. Mary says Noah shouldn't go because if Noah goes too, Henry will just play with Noah the whole time and exclude Aaron. 

To me, that's crazy because then you're just excluding Noah so that Aaron doesn't get excluded. Plus Aaron is reaching an age where he's learning to play with both my kids anyway, and IMO it would be good for him to learn to do so with both my kids. Especially since it's usually the three of them together anyway. 

My wife, Wendy, agrees with her mum and says they don't have to do everything together. I'm thinking I would prefer they either both go, or neither go because it just seems mean to me to exclude only one of them. Although I do concede that my original plan was to essentially exclude both by not taking them at all. 

I also don't want to have to tell Noah his brother gets to go trick or treating but he has to stay home. Now Wendy is mad at me because I suggested the whole thing, and I'm asking too much by trying to offload both kids on Sally. Not that I asked anyone to take Henry in the first place.

Am I just being difficult here? I'm thinking of just calling it off with Sally and driving my two to somewhere that does seem to have a few more halloween enthusiasts. That will cause a new set of dramas with in-laws and/or wife because then I'm kinda circumventing and spitting in the face of their offer. But idk, I think I'd rather deal with their tantrums than my kid's. AITA?

Update: I've spoken to SIL and she says she has no issues at all with taking both my kids. It's only MIL that has an issue with it. I didn't realise at the time of posting that SIL was happy to take both

Hi OP, Noah and I just got back from a picnic in [redacted] park that Sally organised. 
I would like to clarify that the decision for me not to take Noah tomorrow to Sally’s was entirely mine. I think that perhaps I didn’t communicate entirely with you yesterday about my decision, and I apologise for this. I understand that you told Sally you didn’t want to let Henry go to hers tomorrow without Noah. Sally was a bit confused as I never mentioned Noah to her. I am sorry, but messages sometimes are broken up and some details may be left out. 
The reason why I decided not to take Noah tomorrow was based on several factors, the main one being that I’m working tomorrow, I’ll be rushing to the school to pickup Henry, then rushing home to feed [my dog] and clean up her mess and ensure she is toileted before I rush out to Sally’s before rush hour. I’m sorry, but at the time I didn’t realise that Noah would have been too upset as on Thursdays he stays at kindie until late anyway [because for some reason although I help pick up one kidz I refuse to pick up both, even though Noah's daycare is right next to Henry's school].

It was around 8PM and dark outside. I was about 20 meters from the right turn (no stop sign) to get onto my street. As I approach the turn I see a kid who seemed to be about 10 biking and her mom walking behind her (both not wearing any reflective clothing).  I turn on my right turn signal quite early to tell them I'm turning.

I slow down considerably to about 15-20 km/ h, as I always do because I know there are a lot of kids in my neighbourhood. As I'm turning the kid seems to be speeding up/catching up because I was going quite slow to be respectful.

After completing the turn I see the mom taking a picture of my license plate so I get out of my car and ask her why she did that. I didn't quite hear what she said but it was something along the lines of her kid biking and how me turning there was rude and that I'd be hearing from her tomorrow.
In response I told her that I slowed down considerably indicated I was turning long before and that she as a parent should be more aware of her child.

My thoughts on the situation:
I felt like I was driving super safely and made sure to give them plenty of room while I passed them.

Usually parents will tell their kids to stop biking and pull them to the side as a car passes. In this case the mom in my opinion was being extremely irresponsible.

81,1geinj6,AITA My best friend destroyed a car,"Hey Reddit, 24-year-old male here. Alright story time, so I and my college best friend 20 female have been super close friends for almost 5 years even dated in between. Now to the juice, during these 5 years together I myself work a very profitable job and have been able to afford the nicer things in life while my best friend unfortunately has not. So being a gift giver at heart, 3 years into our relationship with one another I gifted her with a car. It was a used Lexus,  I gave this gift out of appreciation and love for her but also for safety. I will explain here in a bit as to why. Now to the parents, her parents have always been nice in a social sense but I have always felt they never had good intentions with their daughter in mind, especially with money. In the past, for context, the parents were poor at one point due to a gambling problem which has since affected them. It also doesn't help that one of the parents, father in particular doesn't work. Now my best friend still lives with her parents at home but her parents every month charge her money for rent, YES rent! Now yes it is nowhere near what rent prices are to this day but it is still a hefty sum of $1100 dollars every month. On top of that, she also has to pay insurance on her own to them which they charge a premium on as well. Lastly, they have complete access to her bank accounts. Okay, so when I purchased the Lexus for her I bought it as a gift as well as a safety thing. Why safety? Well, the reason is that she was driving around 1993 Saturn with no working airbags and ONE functional headlight. Now this Saturn was never purchased for her, it was given by the uncle. Now she had complained to her parents she wanted a new car but in return what they ended up doing was buying the mom a brand new SUV instead. So being a loving boyfriend and friend at the time I surprised her with a car. Now she had this car and had loved it for almost a year and a half until that brings us to today. just a few days ago she got into a car accident( her fault ) now as I arrived at the scene I came to find out the parents (behind her back) had lowered her coverage in secret from full coverage to liability only leaving her with a totaled car. Now I was a bit upset, not only because the gift I gave her was destroyed but because her parents would do something so sly behind her back just so they could pocket the extra money she was giving every month. (This insurance change was made 4 months ago). Now Reddit here is where I feel like the asshole, after the accident I had offered for her to drive my Porsche because she had a long commute and no car but she kindly declined. So I offered to get her another car, only for her to tell me she needed to consult her parents. So I yelled and told her she didn't need them anymore and that she needed to make a decision on her own.

So being a loving boyfriend and friend at the time I surprised her with a car. Now she had this car and had loved it for almost a year and a half until that brings us to today. just a few days ago she got into a car accident( her fault ) now as I arrived at the scene I came to find out the parents (behind her back) had lowered her coverage in secret from full coverage to liability only leaving her with a totaled car. Now I was a bit upset, not only because the gift I gave her was destroyed but because her parents would do something so sly behind her back just so they could pocket the extra money she was giving every month. (This insurance change was made 4 months ago). Now Reddit here is where I feel like the asshole, after the accident I had offered for her to drive my Porsche because she had a long commute and no car but she kindly declined. So I offered to get her another car, only for her to tell me she needed to consult her parents. So I yelled and told her she didn't need them anymore and that she needed to make a decision on her own. She got sad and yelled and has yet to talk to me.",1.0,0.06903845,0,0
82,1gei28s,AITA for not getting along with my MOH’s boyfriend,"This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!

It all started when I met my friend Gina a couple of years ago, and we became close. After about a year, she introduced me to her boyfriend, Jason. My fiancé and I were excited to have another couple friend. 

As we got to know Jason, we noticed he was often tired and would fall asleep when we hung out. He worked at his family’s office supply business, putting in long hours from 6 AM to 5 PM, plus a part-time job afterward. It became clear he didn’t have a grasp on work-life balance, as he lived at home with his family and worked with them. Jason was raised in a traditional environment that emphasized getting married and having kids, and he had never vacationed without his family. 

One issue arose during a conversation about having kids. I expressed that I wasn't ready for children, and afterward, my fiancé revealed that Jason texted him, suggesting he should hurry up and get me pregnant before I “expire.” I tried to keep the peace and didn't confront Jason about the message because whenever we disagreed with him about opinions in the past, he became defensive and shut down our opinions.

Things escalated during our joint bachelor and bachelorette trip to NYC (it was only the 4 on the trip). Jason turned out to be a buzzkill, wanting to avoid touristy activities and insisting on going to bed by 9 PM. One night, we went to a nightclub (which we all agreed about going to), and he made Gina go to bed with him at 9PM. After he fell asleep, she joined us around midnight, but afterward, Jason wouldn’t let her do anything else after 9 PM for the rest of the trip. 

I began to resent Jason for ruining the trip and my fiancé's experience at his bachelor party. It felt like I had to pick up the slack to ensure my fiancé had a good time, balancing my own bachelorette activities while also trying to cater to Jason's preferences. He was particular about timing, insisting we arrive early for reservations, which created tension. I wanted to enjoy my bachelorette party, but it felt like we were hanging out with a dad.

On our wedding day, tensions continued as Jason seemed upset that my fiancé wasn’t giving him sole attention. He noticed I was quieter and not engaging with him, leading him to bombard my fiancé with messages about why I hated him and didn’t want to be friends after the wedding. This wasn’t true; I was just trying to maintain peace in our friend group. 

After Jason confronted my fiancé, I decided to send him a message explaining my feelings about the NYC trip and how he often shut down my opinions. I wanted to move past any resentment and promised to be more engaged in our conversations. He never responded to my message and now Gina no longer talks to me. She lives with Jason and his parents, works with him at the family business, and recently sold her car to share one with him. 

Now I just feel upset and hurt that Gina could so easily end our friendship even though I was trying to keep the peace and move on from what happened in the past. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-29,"AITA for not getting along with my MOH’s boyfriend This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!

So all of us are at a family gathering with my side of the family, including extended family which was about 20-30 people. I am currently 3 months pregnant and the only people I told were me and my husband’s immediate family. My sister in law also offered to move in with us when the baby was born because she didn’t want to live by herself and was only renting with roommates at the moment. We are all just sitting around the house for dinner when my cousin starts serving everyone sushi as an appetizer. When I declined the sushi, my sister really said I’m pregnant out loud for everyone to hear and thats why I can’t have the sushi. I was irritated by the fact that I wasn’t ready to tell everyone and I didn’t want everyone to know yet. So I have a mild but audible fight with her telling her how she shouldn’t have revealed my pregnancy when I told her and the people I told not to yet. My cousins were saying how everyone was going to find out eventually and that it wasn’t that big of a deal.

She starts saying how I’m going to parentify my kids just like how our mom did with me and my siblings. She also says that I’m a terrible mother for letting this happen. I try to tell her that my sister in law is moving in with us to help with the baby but she wouldn’t listen and just kept ranting about how parentification would be passed down in our family. I couldn’t take it anymore so me, my husband, and kids left the house and the drive home was silent.

85,1gehlml,AITA for focusing on my studies and not talking with my best friend,"(I'm sorry I'm on mobile but I rewrote my post to be more readable) 

I (22f) have been friends with Steph (23) since high school (2017). Recently, my aunt told me that Steph had been feeling ignored and hadn't been hanging out with her but I was with others. This was surprising because we'd been in mostly regular contact, and I hadn't been socializing much outside of our friendship due to being in school. 

The bigger shock came when I learned that Steph had found a new house but hadn't told me. This isn't the first time she's kept significant news from me. In high school, she didn't tell me about getting a car or getting a kitten, even though I'd expressed concerns.

A few days ago, I congratulated her on finding the house, and she denied it. I've been avoiding her since.
Am I the Asshole for reacting this way?

86,1gehc86,AITA For Dropping Financial Support Over an Intervention?,"Most of my relatives are poor because have too many kids, despite easy access to abortions. As a high-income earner, I (M43) support them (strong cultural expectations) but cap it at \~25k/year, \~3600/household, which is not enough to pull them above water.

I'm a male childfree cat lady, and not a kid person; this is blasphemy in my culture, but I keep my relatives in line by withholding allowance and humoring misconceptions about inheritance. I was pushed so hard, (back when I depended on them) that I now want NOTHING to do with their kids. I don't babysit, minimize interactions with their kids, and I'm not afraid to pull an Irish goodbye.

2 months ago, my sister Laura (F28) and her husband (M29) got in trouble and will be indisposed for awhile, leaving behind their children (Tim M6, Tom M7 Isabella F5 and Mary F2).

My relatives voluntold me to adopt the kids. After I refused, they asked me to financially support the kids; I offered to donate their allowances to Laura's kids. I thought that was the end of it (despite some muttering), but then they sprang an intervention on me. They accused me of ""not pulling my weight"", ""being selfish"" and ""failing my duties"", and unsubtly implied that they'd go NC if I didn't financially support Laura's kids AND increase their (the adults) allowances.

I was simultaneously insulted and amused. Unbeknownst to my relatives, I've considered cutting them out for a while. I'm effectively LC, and when I do see them, I feel like an outsider, am deprioritized, and am expected to be flexible. They dismiss my goals, achievements and struggles. They add nothing to my life; I only stayed with them because of social/cultural norms around blood, and their ultimatum made it much easier for me to cut them loose.

Some relatives really need my money and are now backtracking. Most are playing the family card (but they're not); others are trying to guilt trip me with their kids (but I don't care about their kids); a few are now ok with my now rescinded offer. I'm not budging; failure to budget on their part does not constitute responsibility on my part. They're not family, and I don't want them back. Flying monkeys have accused me of taking out my dislike of my relatives on their kids and said that I should support them because I easily can, but 1) I'm indifferent to their kids, not malicious 2) I can also support another million good causes, I just don't like this one.
