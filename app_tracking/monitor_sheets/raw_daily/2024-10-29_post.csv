0,1gf1qmi,AITA for not wanting to bond with my father's girlfriend ?,"First of all, I (17 F) know I'm probably a horrible person but I need an opinion from people that don't know me or my family.

Okay, some context : My parents separated last year when I was abroad to learn a new language. It was a whole year trip organised by my school. I was completely aware of that and knew it was for the best since they weren't in love and weren't happy together anymore. My father moved in another appartment. When I came back from my trip, my father told me he was now with another woman. They were together even before my father moved for another appartment, when I left to do my language trip. I learned that his new girlfriend live in the same building as my mother (clich√© I know).

Okay onto the story. My father introduced me to his girlfriend and we spent a day together. All I knew after this day was that this was new to me and I needed time to get used to this situation. The days passed and some things I was uncomfortable with.

It's here I might be an asshole and I genuinely need advices/opinions üòÖ. Firstly she insists a lot to talk to me, spend time with me, etc. I don't have problems with her wanting to get to know me but she insists a lot. When we meet her, she would always come to me and ask me about my day, how I do in school, if I have problems (?), etc. I know it's not flagrant with text but she really insists a lot. Secondly, she already met my father's parents. Same, I don't have any problems with that, the thing is : my parents are not divorced yet. They are separated but not divorced. It's making me a bit uncomfortable but I don't know if that feeling is legitimate.
 
The event that made me write this post is an evening to a restaurant with my father, my father's parents and my father's girlfriend. I was very uncomfortable at this dinner and I didn't talk much (not that I talk much st family dinners anyway). When we were back home, my father told me that he ""didn't know he had such an impolite daughter"", that his girlfriend was trying to fit in this family and that I should be ashamed of my behavior. He also told me I was stupid for blaming the separation of him and my mother on his girlfriend. I never did nor say that once, even in thoughts. I don't even know this woman that much. I tried to explain to my father that I was simply uncomfortable with this situation for now but he said he didn't understand why and that there was nothing to be uncomfortable about.

So here's my story, I honestly don't know if I'm wrong here and if I am, I would take advices. So AITA? ",TL;DR,2024-10-29,"AITA for not wanting to bond with my father's girlfriend ?

1,1gf151j,AITA For getting kicked out of my parents house?,"So this sort of begins when I was a teenager, I got my drivers permit at 16 but I wasn‚Äôt allowed to get my license because my grades were not what my parents wanted. If I couldn‚Äôt keep my grades up then it did not reflect the responsibility I needed to be able to drive alone. I turned 18 at the height of COVID so drivers tests were limited and my family was not going in public, especially crowded areas very often. After everything died down, I got a job at my younger siblings school but I still relied on my father for transportation which I hated because I just wanted to be independent. Finally, I got another job, which was out of the way and was full time, which required my dad to do a lot of running around. Finally, at 21, I got my drivers license. I also did not have a credit score, so financing a car was not in the cards for me. Instead, my dad got himself a truck and I took over the payments on the car he already owned. Fast forward a year later and the car starts having problems which my dad knew about. I told him that it was making horrible sounds and wasn‚Äôt running well. One day on my way home from work it got so bad I was worried about breaking down. He said ‚Äúhopefully you make it to work tomorrow‚Äù to which my friend that I worked with offered to pick me up that night so I could go to work with her in the morning. Being me, I had to prove a point and I drove to work the next morning and shocking no one, I broke down on a busy road during rush hour.

Due to so much stress I ended up in her office talking about how stressed I was and she offered to help with the car. But once I told her the whole situation (how much was still left on the loan, the cars mileage, and how much repairs will cost) she said she‚Äôd rather loan me money to buy a car in my name that will last me years. When I brought this idea up to my parents they obviously got upset and we got in an argument. I already knew they‚Äôd be mad, my friends mom had already offered to let me stay with them, my boyfriend stayed outside while I talked to them. We got in a huge argument, which I think they were upset that I had a plan if they were to kick me out. They also say I was lying to everyone around me and that I was making them look bad because I was telling people around me the situation I was in. That all happened in August and I haven‚Äôt really spoken to them since. My younger sister and cousin sent me incredibly rude messages, my sister also sent my friend messages out of anger.

5,1gf02za,AITA for not leaving the club with my friend in Ibiza?,"So I am looking for a balanced perspective on this. I know that I am at least partly in the wrong, but I don't know to what extent.

So my university friend (22F) and I (23F) went on holiday together. This friend is lovely but I sometimes feel that she tells me what to do. Of course, I'm not perfect either, so I overlook it.

We went to Ibiza for a week with two of her other friends whom I'd never met before. We did what everyone in Ibiza does, we partied every night; the tickets and the whole holiday were very expensive, with some being over ¬£100. Both of us had never been to Ibiza before, and so we seized every opportunity to go and see all the clubs/events that we could.

We mostly had a good time there. There were bickers here and there, but nothing major. But on the last night, something happened. We went to ""Hi"" which is supposed to be the best club in the world. We were going home the next day. The tickets were expensive, and I felt that this would be probably the only time I would be able to get to see this club considering the cost of the holiday.

My friend said she wasn't enjoying the event so she wanted to go home. I felt I hadn't seen enough of it since we had only been there for a couple of hours (maybe 2?) My friend said that if I don't go home with her I'm selfish. I said that considering how every other night I had gone home with her and stayed out with her, I thought we should compromise. But she didn‚Äôt want to, and it turned into hurtful things being said. She started shouting at me. I raised my tone too and she told me not to take that tone with her. She called me selfish, I called her hypocritical. She said she was going home with or without me, and if I didn't come back with her she would never talk to me again because I would be choosing an event over our friendship. I didn't see it that way. I saw it as her getting angry that I wasn't doing what she says.

I said I was staying and she stormed off. The next day, she was very angry. We went on a walk and she said I'm selfish, ""not a girls' girl"", unkind, greedy, immature and should know better at 23, that she knows I'm in therapy but I need to work on myself for future friendships. She said that I've treated her horribly considering how caring of a friend she is. She said she's always had my back- she had to convince the friends she brought with her to give me a chance. As apparently they disliked me at first because I'm ""posh"" and ""shy"". She said she was ending our friendship.

She said that her friends and family think that I'm vile. On the plane ride back, she talked about me to a stranger next to me so I could hear it. I didn't know how to react so I said nothing.

I feel like I should have gone back with her, but I felt bossed around. Could I please have some insight into this situation? I want to learn and grow from this. And the fact that she's talking about me in such a negative light actually bothers me.

he got aggressive, yelling and getting in my face. i could smell alcohol on his breath, which was expected since he has a drinking problem. he drinks every day, so i can‚Äôt always tell if he‚Äôs drunk. when I tried to defend myself, he yelled at me for backtalking and told me to ‚Äúshut the fuck up and go to my fucking room‚Äù i didn‚Äôt want him to see me cry, so i did. he said i was acting like my mom and even accidentally called me her name which offended me a bit

i admit i got upset and cursed back, but i felt attacked for forgetting to text him. i do my work and am passing all my classes. he kicked my mom out, so i‚Äôm managing school on my own

after i went to my room, he demanded I unlock the door. when i did, he repeated everything he had already said. every time i asked a genuine question, he wouldn‚Äôt answer and just told me to stop backtalking. he threatened to send me back to regular school, which i hate. i said he could check my grades on my computer instead of bitching, but he insisted I never mentioned it when i did many times, and it made me feel crazy but i know what i said

later, he came into my room and asked to watch TV, acting like nothing even happened. when I brought up his drinking, he got mad & left. he treats my older sister (25F) differently, much nicer. he used to be nice to me, but since i started calling him out on his behavior, it feels like he doesn‚Äôt love me anymore.

9,1gezu6q,AITA for throwing away the ADHD medication my mother was secretly taking?,"I (f18) was diagnosed with ADHD in 2022, and since then, I have been taking different types of medication to improve my quality of life. Around 2023, I started treatment with Ritalin, but I didn't adapt to the medication, so after talking to my doctor about changing medications, I stored the few remaining boxes on the shelf in my room and left them there. 

It turns out that a few months ago, I started to notice that some boxes were missing... I confronted my mother (f45) and she admitted that she was taking the medication in secret, because she believed that she also had ADHD. 

(Additional context: she doesn't believe in >MY< ADHD diagnosis, which was confirmed by very expensive neuropsychological tests, but she is completely convinced that SHE HAS ADHD based on the Facebook videos she watches. Oh... and she has had eating disorders since she was a teenager, which means she doesn't have a good relationship with her own body.) 

The thing is, she has never been to a psychiatrist in her life and she never goes when I schedule appointments for her. I firmly believe that she only takes it for the side effects: appetite suppression, euphoria and increased motivation. This is NOT good for her, especially since she has never cared about taking care of her own mental health, she doesn't even BELIEVE in the possibility of improvement through cognitive behavioral therapy. 

Anyway, let's get to the facts: I was furious when I found out that she had been taking the medication without any kind of medical guidance and I simply threw away ALL the boxes of Ritalin remaining. She got really mad at me, saying that she paid for it with ""her own"" money (my dad's money actually) and called me... well, an asshole.

10,1gezi7w,AITA for accidentally cutting my bfs toenail too short?,"So early this afternoon I 19F was doing my nails and I noticed that my bf 22M who was sitting beside me hadn‚Äôt cut his toenails in ages, enough that they were poking over the ends of his toes and had that icky discolouration. I told him I wanted to cut his toe nails and asked him to put his foot on my lap. 

I cut all his toenails and filed them since they can be super scratchy in bed if I don‚Äôt and was down to the last pinky toe and I accidentally cut a little too low. He said ouch and I apologised and went to finish cutting the nail off, but he kept jerking his foot so when I went to clip down I accidentally cut too low again. 

It wasn‚Äôt enough to draw blood or anything but he started cradling his foot and closely inspecting the toe. I apologised and said I didn‚Äôt mean too and it was an accident because he was jerking his foot. I then asked if I could just file it so it wouldn‚Äôt scratch me later, to which he got super mad at me.

He kept going on about how it‚Äôs his body and such, which I understand, but the problem is he doesn‚Äôt do any basic foot hygiene at all.
If I ask his to cut his toenails and wash his feet he won‚Äôt do it for days at minimum, and generally by the time I ask him to cut his toenails they are already reeking of toe cheese. 

He said he will file the nail and I asked if he knew how to do it. He didnt reply so i asked again if i could just do this last toe because otherwise it will scratch me, to which he replied ‚ÄúWell I‚Äôll just scratch you then."" At this point I was starting to get pretty mad because if he did this when I asked, or better without being asked we wouldn‚Äôt have a problem to being with. 

The argument continued to escalate, he kept going on about how I didn‚Äôt believe that I hurt him even though I apologised when it happened, I was just trying to make it clear that if he hadn‚Äôt been jerking his foot the way a puppy jerks their paw when getting their nails clipped, I wouldn‚Äôt have cut too low for a second time. I‚Äôll admit I did feel a bit like he was overreacting, and the only reason he wouldn‚Äôt let me just file the nail and finish the job was to be spiteful. 

At that point we started arguing about a whole bunch of other stuff as well, and now I feel like shit, I feel like I overstepped and was being irrational.

We dated long-distance for a year and saw each other twice‚Äîonce she came to here and stayed for a month, and the other time I spent almost three months in her country. Early on, when she visited me, things went well with almost no conflicts. But when I went to her with eight months of dating, I noticed some troubling behaviors:

* She yelled at her mom and even told her to shut up;
* She would restrict when I could shower depending on her mood;
* When I made her breakfast, she simply said, ‚ÄúYou eat it;‚Äù
* In a discussion where we were trying to work things out, she went to check social media;
* When I gave her flowers, she just had a closed-off expression;
* I wanted her to learn my language to better communicate with my family, but she always said she wouldn‚Äôt because she was ‚Äútoo lazy‚Äù;
* She gave me the silent treatment.

On top of this, her mom put a lot of pressure on me to propose, to the point where I wasn‚Äôt allowed to discuss our future until I formally asked for her hand.

After the breakup, I got closer to someone from our shared social circle here. She was the complete opposite, and as we talked regularly, we started going out, and now we‚Äôve been dating for a short time.

So far, things have been great. I was completely transparent with her about the risk she was taking in dating someone so soon after a breakup, and she was fine with it.

I just couldn‚Äôt see a future with someone who behaved that way. After I returned to my country, we stayed together for about a month longer, but half that time was spent in conflict.

When I decided to end things, she promised she would change, but I had already made up my mind. It was tough, but afterward, I felt better, free from the constant anxiety caused by our fights.

After the breakup, I got closer to someone from our shared social circle here. She was the complete opposite, and as we talked regularly, we started going out, and now we‚Äôve been dating for a short time.

So far, things have been great. I was completely transparent with her about the risk she was taking in dating someone so soon after a breakup, and she was fine with it.

P.S.: I always like to emphasize that this is just my perspective. If my ex told her side, it would likely sound very different. Every story has three sides: what one person says, what the other says, and what actually happened.",0.0,1.0155772,1,0
15,1gez1im,AITA for snitching on my best friend?,"Me and ""Mary"" (female, mid twenties) have been best friends for 6 years. We met in college  and I  consider her my one and only best friend. At that time Mary had a new boyfriend. I never liked that guy. At first he was good to her so I couldn't voice any criticism, after 3 years he moved out with her and his behavior changed. He was manipulative, took advantage of her free labor, overly jealous, verbally abused her and went to clubs, took pictures with dancers and posted them on instagram. I encouraged her to break up with him, and she actually did. She told me she was over him, But I never believed her because I knew how much she liked him, but I trusted her. After a while, she went on dating apps to look for a boyfriend but she met a girl. She wanted to befriend her, but the girl had different intentions. She was a lesbian and wanted to get to know her better in hopes of dating her. One thing led to another and they start dating. They looked very happy, and the girl is madly in love with Mary. I've never thought of Mary as a bisexual, but she started complimenting girls more frequently after she got in a relationship so I believed her. After a while, she started complaining about how her gf was ""not mature"" and how her taking the lead all the time is tiring and how it‚Äôs taking a toll on her, but I explained that her gf is pretty young and not experienced so that was to be expected. Moving forward to a couple months ago, ex bf was back in town and he already started stalking Mary at her job. I told her to ask him to leave or to get someone else to talk to him but she said she couldn't do it. I started getting suspicious but I gave her the benefit of the doubt, ""Mary would never betray her gf like that"". How foolish of me. I was leaving town at that time so I was pretty busy, and we didn't have time to talk, but she confessed to a freind that she was back with her ex boyfriend. She also specifically told them to never tell me because she knows I'll be mad at her.

17,1geyozh,AITA for suggesting my mother should risk upsetting my stepdad to spend time with me?,"I, 25F, recently moved back home into my parents‚Äô house following the breakdown of a long-term relationship and subsequent abusive home situation (but alas that is not the subject of this post). Living in the house is myself, my mother (47F), stepfather (44M) and brother (23M). My mother and stepfather married earlier this year and have been in a relationship for the past few years, so I didn‚Äôt grow up with him around. Despite this, I really like my stepfather and it‚Äôs clear that he adores my mum. My mum was never the sort to date when I was younger, and I was always afraid she would be by herself. 

When I was younger and still living at home, my mum and I used to spend most of our free time together, watching TV shows we liked, playing games and just generally having a lot of fun. My brother was the type to lock himself in his room all day; I didn‚Äôt. 

Since returning home, hanging out with my parents is monotonous and boring. They have this set routine of watching the same TV shows every single day once they wake up, and if I dare to watch something that my stepdad doesn‚Äôt want to watch, it‚Äôs a huge issue with my mum. She spends all day cuddling with my stepdad on the sofa with her iPad. It‚Äôs not like it was before. I can‚Äôt even talk when they‚Äôre engrossed in their shows. I just get cursed out and told to be quiet.

We had an argument a couple of days ago when I wanted to show her a quick 3 minute YouTube video. I knew there was no chance that she would watch it when she was in her routine, so I waited until my parents had gotten ready for work (they work together) and would be leaving in 10 minutes or so. My stepdad was still getting ready and my mum had come into the lounge, so I suggested watching this video. Her exact response was ‚ÄúDo I have to?‚Äù and I completely lost my shit. I‚Äôd said something like she didn‚Äôt have to but I was only asking for 3 minutes of her life. It led onto me getting upset over her insistence on spending every waking moment with her husband and ignoring my existence entirely, and she responded that he was her husband and she should be spending her day with him. I answered that he may be her husband but I am her daughter. I asked for her to do some of the things we used to like doing when he‚Äôs in as well, watch an episode of a TV show, play a game for an hour, anything. Maybe he gets a bit upset about it, but I missed the way we used to be. She exclaimed that I was out of line and swiftly left for work with my stepdad as soon as he was ready - he hadn‚Äôt overheard any of the conversation, but no doubt they‚Äôve talked about it. 

My real question is, AITA for asking for a disruption to the routine just to do something we like together? Or is their time together their time and I don‚Äôt have a right to impede on it?

He is right. 


Edit: For clarification the request about how the money was spent was because I spent extra for a costume since I was not sure I would be back in time to go pick it out with him. She said she would take him to get what he wanted. So I sent her extra money ontop of the ordered amount. 

Reason I asked for where did the money go was because she has not stated the original amount is not enough nor made a request to increase it. 

This counts for living expenses also. If she needs more she can ask I have never not send her extra if it is something our son needs. Though the amount in question does cover rent food clothing other general living expenses. So yeah I will question if she states I need more for food when I just sent her money. Which has happened so our order is fairly detailed in what the money is supposed to be used for. Since she has lied in the past.

Edit as per requested I sent an extra 400 over because my son wanted a light saber he saw at gamestop which alone was 235 dollars. She did agree verbally that she would take him and get him the stuff he wanted. I sent her the money on the 1st together with the child support payment. 



So my son's mother and I did not work out. I travel 6 to 8 months out the year due to work. His mother has primary custody and I do send the ordered amount and some extra when I can. 

Fast forward to Sunday I am back for the Holidays. I plan to take my son out for Halloween. He wants to be a Jedi, so I showed him my Jedi costume and asked to see the one his mother bought-I did send her extra to get the costume since I knew I would be back before Halloween just was not sure I would be back in time to get him the costume-she told him that's I was going to buy it. 

I was upset but just played it off and said oh that is right and it was in the mail. Thankfully I found a costume  Yesterday. 

I did reach out to his mother when I had a moment in private to ask her where did the money I sent go. She told me that I have no right to question what she does with the money. Our child's needs are being met and that is all that matters. She has primary custody and gets majority say. I told her that the money was meant for our child not her. 

She was not awarded spousal support. This is where I am getting mixed messages and where I wish to know if what I said made me the asshole. 

My mom said I was being the prick by questioning how she was raising our child when I am not around. I do not think I questioning her parenting but I did question how she used the money I sent. She said she would get him the costume. 

If she needed extra for something that is related to him I will always send extra. Yes, early on I was more accommodating. While she was not granted spousal support I did cover her rent and also childcare but she took forever to get a job and when she did get a job it was a retail job even though she has a teaching degree.

22,1gey0at,AITA for not cooking chicken?,"Throwaway to keep my main private because honestly, this is so fucking stupid 


My self and partner (33F 38M) are childfree, both work full time. 


He is insistent that every meal we eat needs meat. I'm not too fussed, but when I cook I always make sure there's a meat element. 


Over the last few months he's been ""going off"" certain meats. Pork? Nope. Beef? Nope


We can't even have bacon or sausages (unless they're chicken sausages) 


We normally split cooking based on work load, and the last couple of months I've been working OT so haven't been finishing work until 7/8 at night so he's been cooking all our dinners. And everything is chicken based. 

Chicken curry, chicken pie, chicken and rice

Chicken chicken chicken


I've not said anything because I'm grateful I have a dinner to come home to. But I am sooo tired of chicken


My works calmed down over the last few weeks so I've been able to cook for us again, but it's just complaint after complaint. And all about the meat 


I made a chilli, why couldn't I use chicken mince? 

Made toad in the hole, chicken sausages are as nice as pork

Made a steak dinner, why couldn't we have chicken breast? 


I told my partner tonight I was making a apple pork casserole and he asked why it couldn't be apple chicken? I snapped. 


Because I don't want to spend my life eating only chicken. I'll eat only chicken when he cooks, but if I'm cooking I'll do a variety of meals and meats. If he didn't like it, don't eat it. That I am so fucking done with just chicken 


He told me I'm being a dick because his tastes have changed and I should stand with him with it all. Chicken has so many different ways of being made 


But I don't want to just eat chicken

23,1gexs6k,AITA for not helping my unstablly mental friend.,"Tw: SU threads, medicine.

I (F, 28) have been friends with ‚ÄúDara‚Äù (30, F) for over 12 years. We‚Äôve always been close and supportive of each other, especially through struggles with mental health. However, in recent years, I‚Äôve focused on setting boundaries and taking care of my own well-being, which has sometimes created distance between us. I‚Äôve had a lot on my plate‚Äîburnout, ADD diagnosis, family issues‚Äîand often lack the energy to give everyone the support they need.

A few months ago, after a disagreement, I tried to set boundaries with Dara, who responded with guilt-tripping comments (saying things like; It would be a shame if I die and we don't have any contact) about our friendship. Though we resolved things, I started keeping a bit more emotional distance, limiting my responses to her issues and celebrating her successes when it felt authentic.

Recently, Dara had a crisis in a group chat with our friends Eri and Faya (both in their 30s and pregnant), where she mentioned mixing medications with alcohol. Eri tried to calm her down, and even called D‚Äôs mom for help. Dara didn‚Äôt take this well, and things got tense. I ended up supporting Eri and Faya privately, but didn‚Äôt reach out to Dara, as the group chat dissolved before I had the chance.

Question: Am I wrong for not reaching out to Dara after her episode, even though I supported Eri and Faya? I‚Äôm torn between distancing myself for my own well-being and wanting to maintain a long-standing friendship with someone who knows me so well. I don‚Äôt mind listening to friends‚Äô problems, but I need the energy for it and don‚Äôt want to be blamed if I don‚Äôt have it.

24,1gexisp,AITA for pulling my friend aside and telling him to stfu?,"So, my [M17] best friend, Henry [M17], has this thing. I wouldn't describe it as a lack of filter, but more of a lack of fear when it comes to the things he says? He will say the most personal things in the worst situations, some of which could get himself or others hurt, and it's like he doesn't know when to stop. 

Typically, the things he talks about are more on the controversial side. Important context, the both of us are trans men living in the deep south. I, naturally, to stay safe, am so deep in the closet that I couldn't claw my way out if I wanted to. He isn't. I understand being out, and believe me, I want to more than anything, but I just don't believe it's safe for me. I'm glad he feels safe, but I worry for him so much. I'm so scared he'll say the wrong thing and get hate crimed or worse.

Today he was talking to a grown man and a guy friend of ours, I was in the conversation too, and he started bringing up controversial things. Gender, sexuality, the fucking upcoming election and voting for Harris [we can't even vote yet???], things like that. I was on edge, but fine. Free speech and all. Then I saw that look in his eyes that he was about to bring me into this, he was gonna mention something about My gender or sexuality.

Usually, I'm able to change the topic pretty quickly whenever he gets like this, but not today. I excused us, saying I had to go to the bathroom and asked if he'd come with me. When we got there, I told him to shut the fuck up, that he was walking a mighty fine line, and that he was putting us both in danger.

He gave me this weird look and told me to quit being an asshole, said he could talk about whatever he wanted, and that nothing was gonna happen to either of us.

Another tidbit of important information, one of my very close friends was murdered 2 years ago. I'm not saying it's because she was a trans woman, but I can't prove it wasn't. Trans people in my town are not fucking treated well. I had a friend that was out, publicly. He's homeschooled now because the treatment was God awful.

I'm trying to keep us safe. I don't want anything bad to happen to us, if this shit about either of us gets back to my parents I'm dead. Sure, I could've phrased it a little better, but I genuinely believe his mouth will get us in huge trouble.

After our little squabble in the bathroom, one of my other friends came up to me a few minutes later and asked what happened, because she heard I was being a douchebag.

I obviously couldn't explain the situation to her, but I guess I can to y'all. What do you think, AITA?

26,1gexekm,AITA for siccing process server on someone who had left my address down as the registered address for some of his LLCs and wouldn't fix it?,"Bit of an odd one.  I moved into a new house a few years ago.  From the start, we have gotten a ton of mail addressed to various LLCs that all seem related to a property company (call it ""AptCo"").  Many of them have come with return addresses / logos that I recognize as local plaintiffs' law firms.  In the last 18 months, we have gotten doorbell rings for several certified mail deliveries (which we refuse).  I tried many times to reach out to ""AptCo"", but they have no phone # I can find.  I've emailed every address I can come up with, but I don't get a response.  

I tried to figure out why we are getting the mail, and it turns out the principal of AptCo is a prominent local real estate investor, and almost twenty years ago he used to own and live in our house.  I went to the State Corp Commission website and saw that there were several LLCs with our house as the registered address.  I called them and asked to change it, but they said the request has to come from the owner.  So I am back to square one.

Meanwhile, we recently started to get visits from the sheriff and process servers trying to ""serve"" lawsuit papers.  The first time the sheriff showed up, it was stressful.  The last straw was that a process server showed up when only my 13yo son was home and he was very aggressive with my kid.  That motivated me to try to track down the principal of AptCo.  It turns out he belongs to same golf club that my recently moved-here inlaws joined (really only fancy one in the area), and they got me his email.  I emailed him asking him to change the addresses and I heard nothing back from him.  I asked my inlaws to try to maybe find him at the club and buttonhole him.  They did and he said basically ""have them email my assistant"", which I did, and again got no response.

Here's where I may be the AH.  I made a plan for the next time a process server might show up.  I asked my inlaws, is he a member of any regular golf game or activity?  And indeed, there is a men's group that he is a part of.  The next time process-server showed up (a few weeks ago), I told him this was wrong address, but that he could for sure find the principal of AptCo at XYZ County Club at 2pm any Tuesday.   The next Tuesday, the principal was embarrassed by getting served in front of all his friends at the golf club.  My inlaws said it was the talk of the club.  Then I posted disingenuously to NextDoor, ""hey, anybody here know how to reach Mr. X of AptCo?  He must be quite a slumlord, as my address is mistakenly down as registered address for some of his entities and I am getting process servers showing up constantly!  Would appreciate any leads, and obviously if you are in the market to rent, probably consider avoiding AptCo.""

Well, suddenly Mr. X was willing to call me back!  He screamed at me for embarrassing him and said I was an asshole for not finding another way to address the issue.  So, did I go too far?

Even though stuff was all closed and we were meant to stay home, they threw a huge gender reveal because they had always wanted a girl and wanted to celebrate the fact they were getting a girl with everyone they knew. My parents took video of their reaction and one they posted to their socials at the time. It was of them screaming and crying and cheering that they *had their dream come true, getting the child they always dreamed of, the daughter they had always wanted and how they couldn't wait to be parents*. The video got taken down after mom's sister told her she had no idea how lucky she was to have a healthy child and went no contact with my parents (she and her husband had fertility trouble and couldn't have kids).

But I knew from a really early age I disappointed my parents by being a boy. Looking at photos and videos of them before me vs after me, you can see the joy fade. They were told I was a girl. Had clothes, a nursery and everything set up for a girl. They even had a name picked out for girl me. Then I was born a boy.

Lisa and I met as we lived near each other time and we had both just moved in. We only got really close when our friendgroup broke up and Lisa, who was the closest to my age, just stayed with me. From young, Lisa had always been a girl that was constantly in relationships, getting a new boyfriend every few months. Obviously, I wasn‚Äôt too happy about it because all of Lisa‚Äôs boyfriends turned out to be complete a-holes. But the thing is, I found it odd how she‚Äôd cry everyday after breaking up and then immediately find a new boyfriend.

As time went on, Lisa started dating guys that were much older than her and honestly, it irked me. I mean, what kind of decent guy would go for a kid? So I tried to talk her out of it, to tell her just how wrong it was. Lisa hated that tho. We‚Äôd get into big fights because she kept saying i was being too judgy when it wasn‚Äôt even my life but all I was trying to do was to ensure that she‚Äôll be safe so her dismissing my concern like that made me feel like she didn‚Äôt even care about me. Every time she got a new boyfriend, she‚Äôd neglect our friendship. And even if we did hang out, all she‚Äôd do is rant and complain. If tell her that older guys are just taking advantage of her, she‚Äôd get mad at me and the cycle would continue. We only made up because she‚Äôd pretend that nothing happened and I just accepted that because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my best friend.

That went on for years, progressively getting worse and I just gave up. I stopped caring. I knew all about her and her life but she knew nothing about mine. I felt more like a therapist to her than a friend. I was so sick and tired of her ranting about the same exact thing. She‚Äôd ask me for advice, I‚Äôd give her advice, she‚Äôd continue ranting as if she never heard my advice and then it‚Äôll end of by her asking me what she should do when I‚Äôve already told her. I realised she never wanted to listen, she just wanted a punching bag. She‚Äôd ask to call for 5 minutes but the calls would end up taking hours because she‚Äôd repeat the same thing over and over again.

I don‚Äôt see a point arguing with her anymore, especially since she‚Äôll never listen to what i have to say. So I decided to simply ignore her. If she texts, I‚Äôd reply after hours, days even weeks. If she called i‚Äôd pretend I didn‚Äôt notice it. I just know that all she‚Äôll talk about is her relationship problems. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really don‚Äôt like her as a person but I don‚Äôt know how to end a friendship.

As time went on, Lisa started dating guys that were much older than her and honestly, it irked me. I mean, what kind of decent guy would go for a kid? So I tried to talk her out of it, to tell her just how wrong it was. Lisa hated that tho. We‚Äôd get into big fights because she kept saying i was being too judgy when it wasn‚Äôt even my life but all I was trying to do was to ensure that she‚Äôll be safe so her dismissing my concern like that made me feel like she didn‚Äôt even care about me. Every time she got a new boyfriend, she‚Äôd neglect our friendship. And even if we did hang out, all she‚Äôd do is rant and complain. If tell her that older guys are just taking advantage of her, she‚Äôd get mad at me and the cycle would continue. We only made up because she‚Äôd pretend that nothing happened and I just accepted that because I didn‚Äôt want to lose my best friend.

That went on for years, progressively getting worse and I just gave up. I stopped caring. I knew all about her and her life but she knew nothing about mine. I felt more like a therapist to her than a friend. I was so sick and tired of her ranting about the same exact thing. She‚Äôd ask me for advice, I‚Äôd give her advice, she‚Äôd continue ranting as if she never heard my advice and then it‚Äôll end of by her asking me what she should do when I‚Äôve already told her. I realised she never wanted to listen, she just wanted a punching bag. She‚Äôd ask to call for 5 minutes but the calls would end up taking hours because she‚Äôd repeat the same thing over and over again.

I don‚Äôt see a point arguing with her anymore, especially since she‚Äôll never listen to what i have to say. So I decided to simply ignore her. If she texts, I‚Äôd reply after hours, days even weeks. If she called i‚Äôd pretend I didn‚Äôt notice it. I just know that all she‚Äôll talk about is her relationship problems. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I really don‚Äôt like her as a person but I don‚Äôt know how to end a friendship. Honestly, it‚Äôs hard for me to end it too because she‚Äôs been my best friend for so long. So, AITA?",0.0,0.26816732,0,1

For as long as I can remember, my surname itself has been a source of embarrassment for me, to the point where I‚Äôve always just gone by my mum‚Äôs (very common) surname wherever I could (school, work, banks, you name it.). Most people from my past and present know me by my mum‚Äôs last name.

Legally changing my surname has been something on my mind on-and-off for the past decade and when I let my dad know this 6/7 years ago, it was a very brief conversation where he said he wasn‚Äôt happy about it. That was that ‚Äì after an uncomfortable silence, he changed the conversation and neither of us has brought it up since.

Fast forward to now, my passport expires next year and I‚Äôm currently working towards a qualification that I will hopefully complete next year too (where the qualification provider has refused to let me go by my mum‚Äôs surname unless I can prove that I‚Äôve legally changed it). So now seems now a practical time as any.

I‚Äôve had conversations with my mother about doing it ‚Äì she‚Äôs understands (as someone's who‚Äôs laughed at my unfortunate last name when I was a kid) but isn‚Äôt fully onboard because I‚Äôm his only child and it would hurt his feelings. On the only child thing, I did counter-argue that his name/branch of the family tree would end with me anyway as I‚Äôm a woman who doesn‚Äôt plan on having children and I could always change my last name again if I ever got married.

To conclude, I‚Äôm just wondering whether to keep my embarrassing name, legally change it and inform my dad soon after it‚Äôs official, or legally change it but never bring it up to avoid any potential conflict?",4.0,0.034156993,0,0
37,1get2k5,AITA for telling my wife I'm not going to eat ice-cream every night anymore,"So my wife is a big foodie and loves to indulge in a nice dessert every night and 2x on the weekends - think ice-cream or cheesecakes. Luckily, she has always been able to maintain a very low body weight (actually she struggles to not be underweight, more on this later).

  
We have had a habit of eating a dessert every night after dinner and she really enjoys this time, but over the years, I have gained about 10-15kg. This has really caused me to have a lot of frustration with this habit of eating desserts because when I refuse and say I don't want anything today. She guilt trips me into eating with her by saying this like this is her favorite time of the day because this is the only time she gets to enjoy eating.

  
I can understand her point of view because she has had multiple problems with her digestive system and is usually very limited on the food she can eat. We have been to the doctor dozens of times over the years and no one can seem find a diagnosis, but basically, it's IBS, gallbladder problems, acid reflux and other related problems.

  
Because she has had so many problems with her digestive system and has problems, I feel reluctant to bring up my feelings, because I do think she needs to eat some calorie rich food to maintain her weight. But also as an extra note, I am concerned the amount of sugary foods she eats is contributing to some of her digestive issues.

  
For the past year, I have been working out more and trying to keep off the weight, but it hasn't really been working. 

So this evening I told her how I feel about eating desserts every night and she tells me I'm acting like I have body dysmorphia. And if I don't want to eat dessert with her this I can go eat out by myself tomorrow and goes on talking about  why it‚Äôs better to live alone. I'm going to call her on her bluff. 

It feels really silly that this is the biggest issues in our marriage..

I want to be in control of what I eat without having a fight every night.

Am I the asshole? 



 Edit 1: Many comments have suggested that she might be bulimic. I know for a fact she doesn‚Äôt purge. She keeps a pretty strict diet for her actual ‚Äúmeals‚Äù that follows the low FODMAP diet, but has ice cream after every dinner and on the weekend has it after lunch as well.

39,1gerq01,AITA for having Christmas at home? ,"Hi all. First post here and I suspect first of many. 

Every year, my wife and I have alternated who we go to for Christmas each year, flicking from my parents to hers.  This has always been ok, everyone lives close so no more than a 30 minute drive. 

We now have a 2 1/2 year old and I would like to have Christmas at our house this year. For the last two years, we have taken the Boy to her parents and then mine. So they both had him at least once for Christmas. 

My wife has decided she would like Christmas at her parents this year as they would very much like to see him on Christmas Day. Last year we agreed that would be our last and this year we would have Christmas at ours, just us. 

I really want to do our own thing and make our own traditions but my wife isn't into that at all. In her view we ought to see parents as they won't be around forever (they all range from early to late 70s). In my view, this day in age, people live longer and who knows, they may all live another 10 years.  At which point my Boy will have never had Christmas at ours and will always be dragged away. 

She gets a bit emotional about this and gives me the silent treatment when I say we're having Christmas at home. It's awkward and I just need to know whether I am actually being the asshole. 

Oh, finally, I have said I am happy to have people here Christmas Eve all day to do presents etc. That was received with a mild response so maybe that'll happen.

TW: Drug use

Some context: I‚Äôm (M)29, and my partner is (F)31. We‚Äôve been together for around 5 years. Early on, she covered rent, and I handled food. For about 2 years, we earned roughly the same and split family expenses (it was just the two of us then). She found out she was pregnant in March 2023, and in September, her employer didn‚Äôt renew her contract, so she went on unemployment benefits. I told her, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, I‚Äôve got this,‚Äù and took on most of our expenses.

Drug use has always been part of our lives, but back then, I didn‚Äôt see it as an issue. I used to smoke around three times a day myself. Since we had our baby 10 months ago, I‚Äôve cut down to about once a day. She, on the other hand, has ramped up her usage and now spends around 300‚Ç¨ a month on it. I make about 1400‚Ç¨ a month, and she makes around 600‚Ç¨ (180‚Ç¨ of that is government assistance).

I‚Äôve expressed my concerns to her about spending this much, especially since our baby has increased our expenses. But she hasn‚Äôt made any changes and told me, ‚ÄúI do what I want with my money.‚Äù We don‚Äôt have a budget, but her spending impacts us; by halfway through the month, our account is often completely drained, making it hard to cover family needs.

On one hand, I feel I might be in the wrong because I said, ‚ÄúMy money is your money,‚Äù and I worry that setting financial boundaries now could come off as controlling or unfair. But at the same time, I feel that with our child, we need to be more financially stable. WIBTA?

EDIT1: I see that my original post wasn‚Äôt clear enough, so I‚Äôd like to clarify a few things:

\- I should have made this clearer. I‚Äôm deeply concerned about how her drug use affects her ability to care for our child, and I am taking steps to make sure our child is safe.  
\- Talking about her usage directly has been difficult. I have tried bringing it up before, but she insists she‚Äôs ‚Äúin control.‚Äù That‚Äôs why I chose to approach things from a financial angle‚Äîit's a way to address the issue without getting caught in a cycle of denial or defensiveness, which has happened in past conversations.  
\- Our usage is not the same. I do smoke, but it‚Äôs not daily, and I‚Äôm actively reducing my own use, especially since our child was born. She, on the other hand, is using harder substances and has increased her usage. I know it‚Äôs not ideal for me to use at all, but I‚Äôm working to cut back and shift my focus to what‚Äôs best for our child.

EDIT2 : I want to sincerely apologize if I offended anyone with my post. I recognize that my focus was misplaced, and I‚Äôm waking up late to the reality of our situation.

43,1geqbyl,AITA For not paying my friend for festival tickets?,"So September last year, my friend & I decided to purchase tickets for a 3 day music festival with camping in March 2024. Total was roughly, $700 each. Note that she lives in a different state to me (Australia). I recommended she buy flights asap, or as soon as they come up on sale but regardless, flights from her state to mine aren't v expensive. You can easily get flights for >$200 return, even less on sale.

December last year, she decided to quit her well paying job. I again recommended getting flights before she no longer had a income. Instead, she got a kitten.

I sent her a message a few weeks before the event checking on her travel plans. She still hadn't bought flights & was conflicted about attending because of her kitten.

It comes to the week of & I'd been calling her daily to see if she'd made a decision. Its only TWO DAYS before the start of the festival that she conclusively says she won't be attending. She also specifically said, ‚ÄúDo you have anyone that would take my ticket?‚Äù

Unfortunately, no one else in my life enjoys this genre of music. I also am not safely able to attend a 3 day festival solo due to serious medical conditions.

Once she said she wasn't coming, I immediately listed both our tickets on the official resale website, as well as, 2 other resale sites. The festival was sold out, so I was hopeful that they would be sold but unfortunately there were hundreds of other tickets up for sale. I even saw some listed for as low as $67. I had exactly 1 enquiry about the tickets, which lead nowhere.

Regardless, I waited until the Thursday night before I packed my campervan and got ready for the festival & still even left the tickets up until we were driving to the festival. I managed to convince my bf to come with me, despite him disliking the genre immensely.

After the festival, my friend asked me when I was going to pay her for the ticket.

Her argument is that my bf used the ticket so either him or I should pay. My counter argument was that:

1 She bailed last minute.

2. I tried to sell the tickets but they didn't sell.

3. She knew it wasn't safe for me to attend solo, leaving me the options of waste both tickets or pay for both, which I can't afford.

So September last year, my friend & I decided to purchase tickets for a 3 day music festival with camping in March 2024. Total was roughly, $700 each. Note that she lives in a different state to me (Australia). I recommended she buy flights asap, or as soon as they come up on sale but regardless, flights from her state to mine aren't v expensive. You can easily get flights for >$200 return, even less on sale.

December last year, she decided to quit her well paying job. I again recommended getting flights before she no longer had a income. Instead, she got a kitten.

I sent her a message a few weeks before the event checking on her travel plans. She still hadn't bought flights & was conflicted about attending because of her kitten.

It comes to the week of & I'd been calling her daily to see if she'd made a decision. Its only TWO DAYS before the start of the festival that she conclusively says she won't be attending. She also specifically said, ‚ÄúDo you have anyone that would take my ticket?‚Äù

Unfortunately, no one else in my life enjoys this genre of music. I also am not safely able to attend a 3 day festival solo due to serious medical conditions.

Once she said she wasn't coming, I immediately listed both our tickets on the official resale website, as well as, 2 other resale sites. The festival was sold out, so I was hopeful that they would be sold but unfortunately there were hundreds of other tickets up for sale. I even saw some listed for as low as $67. I had exactly 1 enquiry about the tickets, which lead nowhere.

Regardless, I waited until the Thursday night before I packed my campervan and got ready for the festival & still even left the tickets up until we were driving to the festival. I managed to convince my bf to come with me, despite him disliking the genre immensely.

After the festival, my friend asked me when I was going to pay her for the ticket.

Her argument is that my bf used the ticket so either him or I should pay. My counter argument was that:

1 She bailed last minute.

2. I tried to sell the tickets but they didn't sell.

3. She knew it wasn't safe for me to attend solo, leaving me the options of waste both tickets or pay for both, which I can't afford.

4. She had said to me ‚ÄúDo you have anyone that can take my ticket‚Äù which to me meant the ticket was on offer for anyone available to go with me.

My parents berate me for not contributing financially or doing chores at home, despite my absence for several months. I tried to explain to them that I could not afford to support the family (parents and 3 siblings) and my own needs. I also know it's not really about the chores because I was never taught by my mother ""her way of doing them"" because of my mother's OCD. We physically aren't allowed to do the chores. but that's a problem because my mom doesn't do them either even though she is ""the only one who can do it right"" and a SAHM.

My parents also manipulated my aging grandmother into giving them the savings my late grandpa and she saved for me, arguing that I would ""waste it"" even though I only mentioned using it for a house and a wedding. I don't even know which bank it's in I think this and their demanding money for food I don't even eat shows their true intentions. Luckily I also have my savings but is much less them what I was told was in that account.

I lost my Dad when I was 10 and my mom single handedly did her very best to make everything seem as if Dad were still around.She never had support from relatives and obviously made countless sacrifices as we were growing up.

I got married in 2022 and moved to NZ.As soon as we got married, my in laws spun into action by making me convert all my bank accounts into joint accounts with my husband. At the time, their reason was that it would be beneficial for my move to NZ. I constantly turned a blind eye giving them the benefit of the doubt.

Enter husband. The red flags started popping up immediately after our wedding. His total lack of compassion is mind boggling. I used to tell myself maybe he's just shy. I used to get depressed constantly, but I told myself that I'm stuck with this now and maybe I'm the one who needs an attitude change.

So the latest issue began when my mom told me over the phone that she would really like to visit Turkey with one of her friends. My husband who was attending the call with me just stormed off, making the whole thing really odd. He then started arguing with me that I should make her understand that going on expensive international trips at this time is a bad idea, she should be saving money for my sister when she needs to get married. Truth be told, even I thought it was a bad idea at the time since mom just travelled to Singapore this year. But I brushed off his concerns saying that even if I am to object, she wouldn't listen to me and would end up in an argument. Besides, the trip wasn't confirmed at all. We ended up not speaking that whole weekend. I finally lost it and started pushing his buttons to know why exactly he's so concerned about this and ultimately it slipped from his mouth - He doesn't want my Mom to approach us for money after she spends all of hers. I told him it's none of his business what my mom chooses to do with her money and she's never approached us for help. Even if she does, it's my responsibility and I will not abandon my family. My Mom's getting older and has the fomo about not being able to travel and see beautiful places. Things escalated pretty quickly after that and my in laws got involved.

I told her that, while I'm not saying she doesn't have it, it's not impossible that she may not have it. She then began getting really upset with me for saying that ""It was all in her head and that she was making it up.""

53,1geocga,WIBTA if I left my on-campus apartment?,"Throwaway since one of my roomies knows my reddit.

I (20f) and my 3 friends (~20f) are all juniors in college who share an on-campus apartment. The last 2 years I have had single dorm rooms due to my social anxiety but I got to know these 3 girls well the past 2 years and even though I was nervous, I thought they'd be great to live with. And they were. Until recently. 
My school has a thing where seniors aren't allowed to live on campus, we have to get off-campus housing to help us prepare for living on our own, but the school will help us figure out rent and stuff. My roomies haven't talked about it at all but I've heard enough from others who already have their housing that I decide to be the one to bring it up with them. I want to get a good and affordable apartment early, after all, and people are snatching them up. This is especially important since one of my roomies is from a low-income family. 

Well, it turns out that they already got an apartment...3 weeks ago. For 3 people, myself not included. When I asked why I wouldn't have been included in this, one of them said ""I thought you already had a place"" which makes no sense because I had not once talked about housing and I also have no other friends in my grade, they're all seniors. 
While I thought I was good friends with these three, they *do* hang out a lot without me - not as intentional exclusion, but they're all morning people who go out for breakfast together every day, while I sleep in and don't eat breakfast. They seem to have all gotten closer to each other during this time, leaving me behind, which isn't any of our faults in and of itself, but I know the housing discussion must have all happened during breakfasts. And they just...never told me or even asked. 

I have no idea what to do about next year. I can't live with strangers due to my anxiety and if there's no place I can afford I am worried I'll have to transfer schools. I'm hoping they can make a disability accommodation for me, my anxiety is an actual disability and is the reason I was guaranteed a single room the past 2 years. 

Things have been...awkward with my roomies for the past few days and I'm starting to feel a lot less comfortable living with them. I'd really like to switch rooms when the semester is over and go back to a single dorm like I have had in the past. 

But I have two worries about that. If I leave, there are two options.
 
1) the 3 girls' housing cost goes up because they still have to pay for a 4-person apartment, and like I said earlier, one is from a low-income family and can already barely afford college. 

2) they get a new roomie to replace me. one of the other girls is very much like me, with really bad social anxiety and while she has a few other friends in our grade, it's unlikely that she could get one of them and she could also not handle having a random person as a roomie. 

So, WIBTA if I switched rooms for the new semester, even if it meant majorly screwing over one of my roomies?

54,1geo5pf,WIBTA for moving out?,"On mobile so I'm sorry for any format issues. I've changed the names for this story due to this being a throwaway account.

I'm 23 male, I have a roommate who we will name Alice for this story. She is 22 female. For some background, we have been living together for almost 4 years now. I would also like to note that we both struggle with mental health. I am on antidepressants and go to therapy. Alice has stopped going to therapy and will give me excuses as to why she isn't going anymore. She is on mood stabilizers and will stop taking them without telling me or her long distance boyfriend. While I do understand that with mood stabilizers people tend to feel this way and will stop taking them. I wish she would talk to either of us about it so we are aware. I've always tried to be supportive but recently I can't anymore.

I had a friend who was going through a tough time and I had asked Alice if it would be ok if said friend stayed for a while. Alice seemed ok with it. However, she said that ""said friend would have to be ok with us being messy"". That's when I started noticing all of her behavior. I will admit, I might not be the cleanest person but I keep it all to my room. While Alice's stuff spills out into the Common areas. I've tried talking to her about it but nothing changes. This is when I noticed the pattern of us being ok for a while and then her not doing her meds and our relationship going downhill. I've reached my breaking point. I feel like I'm constantly walking on egg shells at home. Everything happened a few months after we had just renewed our lease. I've tried to talk to her about how I feel but she ends up blowing up at or ignoring me.

I can't have people over without her permission even though we both pay the rent. I've been out of a relationship since we moved in together due to me having a nasty relationship before we moved in. Well, I was talking with a guy and he can't come over unless she has met him. I've tried a few times to arrange a time to when they can met but she always gives me excuses. 

Recently her boyfriend flew in. I like her boyfriend, he helps around the apartment,ect. Well they went away for the weekend and she told me this ""Hey I'm going to give you a pass this one time if you want that guy to come over while we are gone, without me having to met him"". It just left a sour taste in my mouth.

She can't seem to be ok with me being happy. Whenever I've tried to talk to her about how I'm getting better with relationships and notice red flags,ect. she just blows me off. She will bring up past mistakes I've made which is uncalled for.

I don't know what to think anymore. If I move out or leave then I don't know what she will do. I'm one of her only friends and her boyfriend lives out of state. She has a rocky relationship with her dad (mom isn't around) and if I leave then she would probably have to move back in with him.

55,1geo3bg,AITA for 'calling his family animals',"My partner and I have been living together for about a year. I have a pet who is old but very well behaved and without many accidents around the house. This is probably the last year she'll be around, so I have asked him to please treat her with a lot of love and attention because she is my whole heart. She was an unexpected rescue who had had a hard life before me and I made a promise to give her the best life I can when I found her. I have gone to many extremes for my pet and would make the same decisions every time. I don't have kids or another responsibility like kids in my life, so I don't feel like setting her as my priority in life is wrong, as I am the only person she has. My boyfriend initially accepted this responsibility but he doesn't feel like giving her love and respect is important, just feeding her pretty much. She really loves him though and it breaks my heart to see her try to get his attention, nudge his hand, fall over (bc she old) trying to reach his height, etc, only for him to ignore her. He also eats her favorite snacks in front of her and doesn't share even though the scent has turned her into a hurricane of desire. For this particular kind of pet, these attitudes are really detrimental. 

The problem is that when I see something that is particularly hurtful and hard to watch, I try to tell him about it and since I have no other points of comparison for him since he doesn't love animals, I inevitably fall into a trap of asking him if he would like for me to treat his family the same way. (I.e. Would you like it if I shut the door in your brother's face when he was trying to get my attention or talk to me? How would you feel if you saw your mom falling over a chair just to talk to me and I just ignored her?) This is incredibly offensive to him and he cannot understand my point at all. He thinks I am saying that his family is animals, I guess, but I have a difficult time understanding why he can't understand that I am just trying to put him into my shoes, even though the comparison isn't perfect obviously. 

In my opinion, if he told me that an insect was the most important responsibility in his life I would treat it as such. If he told me that a plant was the most important responsibility in his life and that I spend an hour a day blowing my CO2 on it, I would do it. And if he compared me ignoring his plant to ignoring my pet, I wouldn't get offended or say one has nothing to do with the other. I would just do it and understand that he has a certain love for a living thing that I cannot understand, but I would spend the time, dedication and intention that he asked me to.

My brother's girlfriend finally messaged me back. I was right, he's not her nephew or in any way related to her. They're currently fighting because my brother refuses to tell her the truth. 

So yes, I won't let my siblings visit him anymore because I don't want them to get involved in whatever stupid thing he's doing now.

There have been other comments, too. When I had a pimple, he looked at me disgustedly and asked when it was finally going away because ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had it for a long time.‚Äù Another time, as I walked away, he made a comment about how flat my butt was. Yesterday was the last straw for me: I was telling him about some issues I‚Äôve been having with my period, spotting outside my normal cycle, and he picked up my feet and, once we finished talking, said they looked like ‚Äúhooves.‚Äù When I got upset, he brushed it off, saying I was only mad because i was on my period.

I‚Äôve told him repeatedly that these comments make me feel insecure and hurt, and I‚Äôve asked him to stop. But he keeps doing it. AITA for being angry about this, or am I overreacting?

He‚Äôs the type of man who looks handsome clean shaven, but when he tries to grow facial hair, he looks like he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed within 100ft of an elementary school. He wants to grow it out to attract women.

We were texting and I said ‚Äúyou should shave lol‚Äù and he replied, ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù And at first I said, ‚Äúit‚Äôll grow back thicker, and I think you look better clean shaven.‚Äù He got a bit offended and asked why once more, so I explained that it‚Äôs thin and gross looking, no woman wants to date him because of his facial hair. Once again he got offended and stopped replying.

I think I was too mean with the way I said it, or it just wasn‚Äôt the right time. I‚Äôm planning on apologizing either way, but Am I The Asshole? Should I have never brought it up?",1.0,1.0585395,1,1
67,1geltod,"AITAH for not inviting my friend to our friend group gatherings anymore because this friend told someone else what I did to them?
","I was best friends with someone (let's call them Tay) for a long time. I met Riley, Tay‚Äôs now ex, through Tay and some mutual classes we all had. Tay and Riley dated, but ended up breaking up for reasons Tay did not want to tell me. Riley and I ended up falling for each other. Riley eventually wanted to date, (we were currently ‚Äútalking‚Äù), but I refused until a few more months passed, when we would end up going to a different school than Tay because of our differing career paths. Riley and I intended on never telling my friend Tay that we were talking, or that we liked each other, so Tay would not be hurt. When we moved schools, we could date freely, so for now, our friend groups also agreed on keeping this a secret from Tay. I did care a lot about Tay, but I could not help my feelings for Riley. Due to an incident that happened with Riley, I decided to distance myself from Riley, but Tay did find out somehow about us, but never told me how. Tay forgave me, and we decided to put what happened past ourselves, and remained friends.¬†



Some time passed, and I met someone else that had gotten to know Tay through mutual friends. Let‚Äôs call this person Heat. Soon enough I realized that Heat and Tay seemed to be on a talking stage, romantically, though Tay also ended up cutting things off with Heat eventually. With no idea why this happened, I began to get to know Heat more. After months of being friends, I fell for Heat, and Heat seemed mutually interested, seeming to have finally gotten over Tay. We began to flirt more, talk more, and I began to feel like I did with Riley. I thought that maybe, this time, things would work. One day, Heat and I got into an argument over something stupid, but it got to the point where Heat snapped. ‚ÄúI KNOW what you did to Tay in the past. They told me you and their ex were romantically involved, and when they asked you about it you lied several times. You're a horrible person and you have no right to be yelling at me for something stupid when you have done worse.‚Äù Heat yelled. I was shocked. I cut off contact with Heat. I was also very mad at Tay for telling Heat what I had done. I know they had gotten close at one point, but why did Tay have to talk about something that was supposed to be in the past?¬†



In the present, my friends and I hang out a lot, and some of them have even talked to me about some of Tay‚Äôs career plans and their current state, since they have talked to Tay due to going to their same school. Said friends seem to wonder why Tay cannot hang out with us when we plan our gatherings, since Tay always seems enthusiastic about a potential hang out when my friends mention it. I usually volunteer to plan the hang outs and inform Tay, though, so I don't have to actually invite Tay, because I don‚Äôt want Tay in my life anymore. I fell for two people who Tay rejected, and lost the second one due to Tay talking about the incident with the first one. AITAH for telling my friends Tay just does not want to hang out?

I am British, she is Australian, we moved Down Under mainly for her to be closer to her family but also because we thought it would be a nicer place to raise a family. Both of her parents have passed away, she has 2 sisters (with partners and kids) within a 20 minute drive who we see regularly, probably 2 or 3 times a month. Our marriage has had some ups and downs but we‚Äôre tried to work through things and I‚Äôve spent a lot of time with her family (who I get on well with)
¬†
The issue we‚Äôre having is that we disagree on where to spend much of Christmas 2024. My wife would like to spend the morning at home with our family of 4, then at about 11am we‚Äôd drive for 2+ hours to her sister‚Äôs husband‚Äôs parent‚Äôs house because that is where both of her sisters will be. We‚Äôd spend the whole of the afternoon and evening there, before sleeping in a tent outside because there isn‚Äôt enough room in the house (there must be 20+ people attending including all of my brother-in-law‚Äôs family and their families).
¬†
I would like to spend the whole day at our own house and in our own home with the 4 of us, having our own intimate Christmas, rather than spending much of it driving and at my sister-in-law‚Äôs husband‚Äôs parent‚Äôs house. We did this years ago and I felt like an outsider, gatecrashing another family‚Äôs day (even though they were happy to have us).
¬†
In the 8 years that we have been in Australia, we have flown back to the UK once to spend it with my family out there. My mother has also flown out here once to be with me and her grandkids. On the other 7 occasions in Australia, so 7 times out of 8, we have spent lunch and the afternoon with all of her family, sisters, in-laws, their kids, aunties and uncles etc. This has either been at their houses down the road, hosted at our house, or that one time we went to the place which is being discussed.
¬†
I tried to compromise by saying that although I don‚Äôt want to spend some of Christmas in a car and with many people who we barely know, I‚Äôd rather spend it at home, why don‚Äôt we go there on the 26th or host a lunch the week before, or both. My wife doesn‚Äôt like any of these ideas and is upset, saying that I would be stopping her from being with her sisters, the kids would have fun being around their cousins, that I shouldn‚Äôt just get to decide and that I‚Äôm making this all about me.

Moving to the other side of the world, spending almost every Christmas with them, and seeing them all the time isn‚Äôt stopping her from seeing her sisters. I think it‚Äôs the opposite.

We‚Äôve discussed a future and planned out our timeline of our engagement and marriage. We agreed on our engagement to be before the end of the year.

Fortunately I was able to do the right thing and get her parents blessings and then soon go ring shopping with K‚Äôs mom (D) and sister (A). We went to a big jewelry shop where we‚Äôre able to order the perfect engagement band for K. The ring would take about 2 weeks to get to the store. Last week the ring came in and I asked D and A if we could see the ring together on Saturday 10/25, as K won‚Äôt be home. A was working that day and wouldn‚Äôt be able to go, so it would be just me and D. I thought I had communicated that though I‚Äôd prefer if all three of us could go together, I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it were me and D. However,I found out that D and A didn‚Äôt know we still had planned to go. The miscommunication is my fault and I accept that I should of verified first long before the day in question. D asked if we could reschedule, but I didn‚Äôt want to potentially reschedule and push my plans back another week/month trying to coordinate with 3 different schedules. I have 2 months left to plan something and I imagined I‚Äôd be cutting it pretty close. So with that in mind I respectfully told D that tho I take responsibility for the miscommunication, I really can‚Äôt push my timeline anymore than I already have. Needless to say D was not pleased and told me ‚Äúwhatever, do what you want‚Äù. I backtracked and said I could just look at the band and buy the diamond and ask the jeweler to hold onto them until we all came together during the weekday after work to see it. She then proceeded to tell me ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to talk to you rn‚Äù. So at a loss as to what to do I went forward with my plans. I sent a text message to the both of them apologizing for the miscommunication and the hurt I caused.

She said that there‚Äôs no moving forward from this and that I ruined it for her, that it breaks her heart that K probably won‚Äôt have a wonderful memory of her proposal, but that‚Äôs on me because I ruined it and I‚Äôll have to live the rest of my life knowing that.

73,1gejv2y,AITA for trying to get out of a cruise my bfs mom booked for us? ,"First, there is some relevant context but i guess it isn't too necessary, so skip this part if you're too lazy: So, my bf and i have been together for 3 years. I love his family so much, they've done more for me than my own. His mom actually let me move in with them to finish school in my hometown when my dad moved states and my mom was neglecting me too much for me to stay with her. One thing, though, is that her and my boyfriend are both horrible at planning and then actually communicating those plans. They are some of the most last minute people I have ever met. I love them, but it's true. I cannot handle that with my severe anxiety; i NEED to have plans communicated or else i will be too anxious to even try to enjoy my time or sometimes too anxious to go. This hasn't caused anything this major until now. Another thing I think is important to note: i'm weird about my birthday. I've had it ruined so many times from my parents arguing to them putting down my childhood dog to my friends forgetting it entirely. So, my birthdays haven't really been great especially for my childhood, so as i get older, i try to take more control and make it enjoyable for myself.

So, a few months back my bfs mom suggested we go on a trip after graduation. It seemed like the sweetest idea and i was over the moon about it. I have always wanted to go to europe, literally anywhere in europe. So she said we could go. I was so excited! She suggested a cruise because those tend to be cheaper and easier. however, upon looking at the prices (which ARE HIGH which makes this understandable) and realizing she would be alone in europe with two teenagers, she had us pick somewhere else. I looked with my boyfriend at the other cruises, and none seemed appealing. I suggested we figure something else out like driving somewhere in the states or going to chicago for a weekend. Fast forward to yesterday in october, she told me she booked the cruise. We had no conversation apart from months back about this. She then told me the last day is my (18th) birthday. This would be the day we are coming back, so it would literally just be a day of travel. I have cried about this several times and my boyfriend doesn't seem to understand. You may say "" you can do stuff another day!"", but for me, it‚Äôs the actual day that really matters yknow? I also forgot to mention: the trip was originally me, my bf, and his mom.

I (16f) recently went to my uncle's wedding and it got me thinking about my own wedding and what I would do. 


I thought about who was walking me down the aisle and in my mind I decided that I would really like my mom to do it. 


Anyways, a few days ago I told my mom that I already had some of the things I would like in my wedding planned even tho it's very far away. 
And one of those things was for her to walk me down the aisle. Now I told this to her in the kitchen, I didn't know my dad was in the diner listening to my conversation and he overheard this and got upset and asked me why I don't want him to walk me down the aisle. 


I have a whole [post that explains some of the things he does](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/s/MvtnHQvikE) that might give you an insight to why I would rather have my mom walk me down the aisle. 

I told him that while I do love him, and of course he will be at my wedding, the person who walks you down the aisle is supposed to be the person who was there for you, who took care of you, who loved you the most and protected you, and is now ""setting you free"" to another person to start your new family with another person you love, and that person is my mom, she has always looked out for me, she always wants to be spending time with me, she always takes care of me, she has conversations with me, she asked me about my day, she knows me, which is specially important to me because for example, my dad knows that maybe I like some music, like for example my favorite band is my chemical romance, but not because he has asked me;
 he knows it because I blast it at full volume in my Alexa. 

But he doesn't know my friends, doesn't know about things that happened to me with them, that happened to them in school; because he doesn't ask how my day was, he doesn't ask if something happened, he doesn't ask anything, anyways, the whole explanation is in my other post 

So I think I would really like my mom to walk me down the aisle because she is the person who has looked out for me my whole life, but now I'm feeling a little bad that I told him to his face that I would rather have my mom with me down the aisle even though he has many things to me.

For context: I am 31 weeks pregnant very high risk and within the same day (2am) of him deceloping a cold I left the hospital because I was in a hypertensive crisis earlier and was on the fence of being induced by the Dr for pre-eclampsia signs. My husband (32M) was at the hospital at the beginning but had to take our kid home and came back to pick me up once I was cleared. 

Here's the issue: after not alot of sleep , still woke up to take our kid to school, noticed he was still home and he told me he was not feeling well(sore throat, congestion etc) I made him some  breakfast and hot tea and took my kid to school. I came home and took my first round of meds and went back to sleep. I woke up around noon, still not feeling to great so I  ate took my second round of meds checked to see if he had a fever while sleeping  and picked up the kitchen a bit. Around 230pm I woke him up and asked him if he could take me to pick up our kid and pick up more meds (if I have the option to not drive it's easier then to  drive because my belly hits the steering wheel and is uncomfortable) and that he should drink some water and eat something. He agrees but looks visibly upset and continues to look upset throughout the time.

We get home I ask him what's wrong and he says ""I do not care about him because I couldn't even get him water when he was sick"" I am confused because I'm still trying to take care of myself after the hospital, so i told him i can only do  what I could do in the mean time (make breakfast while he was awake ) I asked if he wanted any other help and said he'd do it on his own because once again I do not care. At this point I'm getting upset because he knows the issues I've been having and realistically I dont want to risk getting sick myself,  but he said it wasn't a issue since we rode in the car together (fully masked). He then began yelling at me that I never return the same amount of care for something as simple as waking him up to take meds and give him water.

I'm confused on if I AITA or not because if circumstances were different I wouldn't mind taking more care but I'm just not physically or in the mental space to keep taking care for others while my health in pregnancy is declining. I feel bad that he has a cold but even the arguing raised my blood pressure to almost the point of having to go back to the hospital.

78,1gej3e6,AITA for giving a both or neither ultimatum to my MIL for taking my two kids trick-or-treating?,"So my eldest kid, Henry (7), has been talking a lot about halloween. He's really keen and wants to go trick or treating. However, we live in Australia and it's just not really a thing here, at least where I am. I haven't seen a single decoration in our suburb. All I *have* seen is a few signs expressing outright hostility towards it because it's ""un-Australian"", which is just an eyeroll from me. I'm not personally against it, and every year I buy a bag of lollies just in case. But in 5 years of living here I've had no takers. 

So I've been telling Henry sorry but no. I mentioned offhandedly to my mother-in-law, Mary, how keen Henry is. She says my sister-in-law, Sally, is taking her son Aaron (4) because there's a lot of places around them that actually do do halloween. Before I could object, Mary spoke to Sally and asked her to take Henry too. Sally agreed. 

Now, I know if Henry goes but not my other kid, Noah (5), Noah will be super upset that he's missing out (he's also an absolute sugar gremlin). So I ask Mary if it would be asking too much for Noah to go too. Mary says Noah shouldn't go because if Noah goes too, Henry will just play with Noah the whole time and exclude Aaron. 

To me, that's crazy because then you're just excluding Noah so that Aaron doesn't get excluded. Plus Aaron is reaching an age where he's learning to play with both my kids anyway, and IMO it would be good for him to learn to do so with both my kids. Especially since it's usually the three of them together anyway. 

My wife, Wendy, agrees with her mum and says they don't have to do everything together. I'm thinking I would prefer they either both go, or neither go because it just seems mean to me to exclude only one of them. Although I do concede that my original plan was to essentially exclude both by not taking them at all. 

I also don't want to have to tell Noah his brother gets to go trick or treating but he has to stay home. Now Wendy is mad at me because I suggested the whole thing, and I'm asking too much by trying to offload both kids on Sally. Not that I asked anyone to take Henry in the first place.

Am I just being difficult here? I'm thinking of just calling it off with Sally and driving my two to somewhere that does seem to have a few more halloween enthusiasts. That will cause a new set of dramas with in-laws and/or wife because then I'm kinda circumventing and spitting in the face of their offer.

To get to the main problem. I message the group chat (L wasn't added to it yet due to his preference) i was having a tough night (i struggle from mental health problems) so I messaged the gc hoping i could talk to someone, F answered and talked to me for a while i asked her for a hug since that's what everyone in our friend group does if someone is upset or we think they are upset, and she said she would. the next morning i wake up to her blocking me and her bf giving me an earful because I didn't ask him if she could give me a hug? i see how it could be disrespectful but it has never been a problem in out friend group? it has divided out friend group up with 2 saying I'm not in the wrong one staying in the middle but L and F saying im in the wrong.

I message the group chat (L wasn't added to it yet due to his preference) i was having a tough night (i struggle from mental health problems) so I messaged the gc hoping i could talk to someone, F answered and talked to me for a while i asked her for a hug since that's what everyone in our friend group does if someone is upset or we think they are upset, and she said she would. the next morning i wake up to her blocking me and her bf giving me an earful because I didn't ask him if she could give me a hug? i see how it could be disrespectful but it has never been a problem in out friend group? it has divided out friend group up with 2 saying I'm not in the wrong one staying in the middle but L and F saying im in the wrong. 

I fell like i am the a-hole for talking about it and making them seem like bad people to others but i was really just saying my side of the story?

so AITA for asking for a hug?",0.0,1.0217056,1,0
80,1geiqn9,AITA for turning right while kid biked near me. ,"Context:
It was around 8PM and dark outside. I was about 20 meters from the right turn (no stop sign) to get onto my street. As I approach the turn I see a kid who seemed to be about 10 biking and her mom walking behind her (both not wearing any reflective clothing).  I turn on my right turn signal quite early to tell them I'm turning.

I slow down considerably to about 15-20 km/ h, as I always do because I know there are a lot of kids in my neighbourhood. As I'm turning the kid seems to be speeding up/catching up because I was going quite slow to be respectful.

After completing the turn I see the mom taking a picture of my license plate so I get out of my car and ask her why she did that. I didn't quite hear what she said but it was something along the lines of her kid biking and how me turning there was rude and that I'd be hearing from her tomorrow.
In response I told her that I slowed down considerably indicated I was turning long before and that she as a parent should be more aware of her child.

My thoughts on the situation:
I felt like I was driving super safely and made sure to give them plenty of room while I passed them.

Usually parents will tell their kids to stop biking and pull them to the side as a car passes. In this case the mom in my opinion was being extremely irresponsible.

Anyways not sure if I was in the wrong here or not but hoping to hear others opinion.",Asshole,2024-10-29,"AITA for turning right while kid biked near me.  Context:

81,1geinj6,AITA My best friend destroyed a car,"Hey Reddit, 24-year-old male here. Alright story time, so I and my college best friend 20 female have been super close friends for almost 5 years even dated in between. Now to the juice, during these 5 years together I myself work a very profitable job and have been able to afford the nicer things in life while my best friend unfortunately has not. So being a gift giver at heart, 3 years into our relationship with one another I gifted her with a car. It was a used Lexus,¬† I gave this gift out of appreciation and love for her but also for safety. I will explain here in a bit as to why. Now to the parents, her parents have always been nice in a social sense but I have always felt they never had good intentions with their daughter in mind, especially with money. In the past, for context, the parents were poor at one point due to a gambling problem which has since affected them. It also doesn't help that one of the parents, father in particular doesn't work. Now my best friend still lives with her parents at home but her parents every month charge her money for rent, YES rent! Now yes it is nowhere near what rent prices are to this day but it is still a hefty sum of $1100 dollars every month. On top of that, she also has to pay insurance on her own to them which they charge a premium on as well. Lastly, they have complete access to her bank accounts. Okay, so when I purchased the Lexus for her I bought it as a gift as well as a safety thing. Why safety? Well, the reason is that she was driving around 1993 Saturn with no working airbags and ONE functional headlight. Now this Saturn was never purchased for her, it was given by the uncle. Now she had complained to her parents she wanted a new car but in return what they ended up doing was buying the mom a brand new SUV instead. So being a loving boyfriend and friend at the time I surprised her with a car. Now she had this car and had loved it for almost a year and a half until that brings us to today. just a few days ago she got into a car accident( her fault ) now as I arrived at the scene I came to find out the parents (behind her back) had lowered her coverage in secret from full coverage to liability only leaving her with a totaled car. Now I was a bit upset, not only because the gift I gave her was destroyed but because her parents would do something so sly behind her back just so they could pocket the extra money she was giving every month. (This insurance change was made 4 months ago). Now Reddit here is where I feel like the asshole, after the accident I had offered for her to drive my Porsche because she had a long commute and no car but she kindly declined. So I offered to get her another car, only for her to tell me she needed to consult her parents. So I yelled and told her she didn't need them anymore and that she needed to make a decision on her own.

82,1gei28s,AITA for not getting along with my MOH‚Äôs boyfriend,"This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!

It all started when I met my friend Gina a couple of years ago, and we became close. After about a year, she introduced me to her boyfriend, Jason. My fianc√© and I were excited to have another couple friend. 

As we got to know Jason, we noticed he was often tired and would fall asleep when we hung out. He worked at his family‚Äôs office supply business, putting in long hours from 6 AM to 5 PM, plus a part-time job afterward. It became clear he didn‚Äôt have a grasp on work-life balance, as he lived at home with his family and worked with them. Jason was raised in a traditional environment that emphasized getting married and having kids, and he had never vacationed without his family. 

One issue arose during a conversation about having kids. I expressed that I wasn't ready for children, and afterward, my fianc√© revealed that Jason texted him, suggesting he should hurry up and get me pregnant before I ‚Äúexpire.‚Äù I tried to keep the peace and didn't confront Jason about the message because whenever we disagreed with him about opinions in the past, he became defensive and shut down our opinions.

Things escalated during our joint bachelor and bachelorette trip to NYC (it was only the 4 on the trip). Jason turned out to be a buzzkill, wanting to avoid touristy activities and insisting on going to bed by 9 PM. One night, we went to a nightclub (which we all agreed about going to), and he made Gina go to bed with him at 9PM. After he fell asleep, she joined us around midnight, but afterward, Jason wouldn‚Äôt let her do anything else after 9 PM for the rest of the trip. 

I began to resent Jason for ruining the trip and my fianc√©'s experience at his bachelor party. It felt like I had to pick up the slack to ensure my fianc√© had a good time, balancing my own bachelorette activities while also trying to cater to Jason's preferences. He was particular about timing, insisting we arrive early for reservations, which created tension. I wanted to enjoy my bachelorette party, but it felt like we were hanging out with a dad.

On our wedding day, tensions continued as Jason seemed upset that my fianc√© wasn‚Äôt giving him sole attention. He noticed I was quieter and not engaging with him, leading him to bombard my fianc√© with messages about why I hated him and didn‚Äôt want to be friends after the wedding. This wasn‚Äôt true; I was just trying to maintain peace in our friend group. 

After Jason confronted my fianc√©, I decided to send him a message explaining my feelings about the NYC trip and how he often shut down my opinions. I wanted to move past any resentment and promised to be more engaged in our conversations. He never responded to my message and now Gina no longer talks to me. She lives with Jason and his parents, works with him at the family business, and recently sold her car to share one with him. 

Now I just feel upset and hurt that Gina could so easily end our friendship even though I was trying to keep the peace and move on from what happened in the past. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-29,"AITA for not getting along with my MOH‚Äôs boyfriend This is going to be a long one, so get your popcorn!
