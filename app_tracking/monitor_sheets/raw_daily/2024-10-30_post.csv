0,1gfhjkm,AITA? I've been told I'm mean to my co-workers.,"So, I'm a 20 year old transman and autistic. I'm bad with tones and don't realize my temper when I'm stressed. 

There's this coworker I have and she's an older women but she's nice and tries to help. Recently she's made comments about my body. She said I need to loose weight, that I needed a gym membership, that I looked like a bull (I had a face nose ring in) and asked if I had a boyfriend multiple times. 
She's not very good with English but I understand her well enough. Tonight in the last hour of my six hour shift I said I was tired. She said I can't be tired because she worked longer than me and wasn't tired. 
I snapped. 
I told her I didn't need her opinion and that I was tired and couldn't help it. I was so mad. She said she wasn't going to be nice to me anymore when I'm ""never nice to her"". 
Apparently I have streak of being mean when I'm stressed or when I first come in at work. I didn't know because no one ever tells me when I'm rude so I can apologize and improve. (By mean, they mean I refuse to help, I'm short with answering, snappy, I'm quiet and I don't smile. I also tend to ignore them when I focus because they just end up being white noise) 
I get stressed when I walk in because sometimes nothing will be done. I'll have cups to stock, cookies to bag, extra salad bar containers to make, cakes to put together, sauces to make and stock, chips to get down (I'm too short to reach them otherwise) chips to stock, drinks to stock, orders to take and bag while I have little to no help because most of them refuse to help me unless we're so busy that I'm falling behind on orders. It's hard to help them when I'm falling behind on my own tasks.

1,1gfubor,WIBTAH if I talked to my son’s teacher about dog tags they hand out at school,So my son 6 male started Kindergarten this year. Well his school hands out dog tags when kids meet certain learning goals. I take issue with these because it feels like another way to pit the kids who are struggling against those who aren’t struggling. I feel like it’s the same as the colored behavior charts that were used in the 90s and early 2000s. It to me feels like a way to shame those who are struggling. I can admit I may be in my feels about this since my son is one of the struggling kids. He has an IEP which gets him extra help and I honestly feel like he and other kids like him are being made to feel bad about themselves. They passed some out last week and my son didn’t get one and when I asked him how it made him feel he said sad. My kid is smart but because he was born 6 weeks early due to me developing preeclampsia he has always had developmental delays and to me this just feels like another way to belittle kids like him. ,Asshole,2024-10-30,WIBTAH if I talked to my son’s teacher about dog tags they hand out at school So my son 6 male started Kindergarten this year.

The conversation was like having on with an old acquaintance. The was no ""I love you"" or ""I miss you"". The whole encounter had me in the frozen foods having a mental breakdown. I cut him off when he chose his manipulative and abusive (to me and my sister) wife over his kids. Besides the grocery store, the last conversation we had was about his wife calling my sister a lying bitch when she tried to tell my father that his wife was accusing me of being a thief. This was the nail in the coffin of our relationship with our father. He was already on thin ice by missing the birth of my sister's son because of his wife.

3,1gfu7t6,AITA for calling someone a bitch on the city bus,"This happened yesterday. I got on the bus leaving a community college. The bus was very crowded so I took the only open seat (excluding seats taken up by backpacks and other bags) which happened to be in the front area where elderly and handicap people tend to sit. I personally never sit there and leave those seats for others. Shortly after I sat a younger looking guy got on with a girl. He sat near me and on an aisle seat, but he was basically in the aisle. After the bus took off, for whatever reason he and the girl got up. She moved back a few seats. But he just stood there in the aisle. He stayed there for the rest of the bus ride, standing After a few stops and more and more people got on they started to crowd up near the front, since he was blocking the aisle. At one of the stops, a lady and 2-3 kids got on. Since I was in the front area I decided to leave my seat for them and find one in the back. To do that I had to pass the guy blocking the aisle. Before I even got to him he stared at me and said to me ""say excuse me bitch"" I didn't even react to him, walk passed and sat in a seat. Also when I got passed him there were now 4 empty seats so he easily could have sat down and not block everyone. 

About 10-15 minutes go by. He's still just standing there. My stop comes up. I get up to leave, and as I walk by him to get off I tell him ""excuse me bitch."" He says something that I didn't understand. He then got off the bus at the stop I got off at and he followed me for a block or so. He eventually catches up to me and asks ""what did you say back there"" I just said ""excuse me bitch."" He, (and the girl) continue to follow me. Now I don't recall everything he said at this point but he's calling me names. The girl calls me a "" faggot"" I just continue walking telling them I don't have time for this.

4,1gfu3y4,AITA for kicking my friend out of my apt because of my girlfriend,"I (33M) just started dating my girlfriend (34F) about a week ago. We've known eachother about a month. I have been friends with Casey (29F) for about 2.5 years. We were just friends for a few months then we hooked up for about 3 months while she was getting over her ex. We stopped sleeping together when she started dating Evan. After her and Evan broke up, we did not sleep together and have been completely platonic. She started dating another guy, Aaron about a year ago and they are happy together. Evan placed a boundary that me and Casey couldn't be in the same room together alone (but could do stuff in public or with other people if at an apt) which we both stuck to. Aaron has placed no such restrictions. 

I often host events for Casey because she has a much larger social network but can't host in her apt (we live in NYC so apts are small). I enjoy hosting with her since she does most of the planning and in turn she invites me to many social events which I also enjoy. 

Recently Casey and I co-hosted a brunch on Saturday which is where Casey met my girlfriend, Jane. Casey actually encouraged me to continue dating Jane when initially in our 2nd date, I wasn't really sure about her. I also told Jane at the time we became exclusive that Casey and I had used to sleep together and she wasn't particularly comfortable with the situation. 

For reference, both me and Jane live alone. And Casey lives with her boyfriend about an hour away by subway. I told Jane that we could have some alone time in the afternoon but did not relay that to Casey because I assumed that she had plans. The night before the brunch Casey said she was planning on napping between the brunch and us going out to Halloween parties (which she invited both me and Jane to, the parties were close to us). I would think about it. Later over text Casey said if the brunch was still going on til 6, could her and her boyfriend stay in between and I agreed. 

The brunch went well but at 5pm Jane said she was tired and asked me to kick people out. About 7 were left from the 13 total that came. 

Casey points out that we could have had alone time on Friday, the morning before the brunch or we could have skipped the Halloween parties. She was pretty mad she had to spend 3 hours walking around Brooklyn with nowhere to go, as it wouldn't have made sense to go home then come back.

My son is turning 8 this his weekend, and I booked a party at one of those indoor trampoline parks where the party package is based on the number of kids. I booked for 20 kids which would allow 15 friends, his cousins, and his brother. 

We sent out the invitations a week or so ago, and I’ve heard back that some of his friends. There’s 10 kids coming (including the family members) and five I haven’t heard from either way. 

I was chatting with my mom last night and mentioned that I might drop the party booking from 20 to 12 to save money (roughly $200). My mom thinks that would an AH move because the other kids could show up and what then. I told her if they show up without RSVPing by the date on the invitation then that’s on their grownups. 

My mom is the nicest lady in the world, but she also taught me manners. RSVPing to a party is good manners. She said it’s not the kids’ fault if the grownups don’t RSVP, and I do see her point. I also don’t want to pay for the kids if they don’t show up.

8,1gftm03,WIBTA if I invite my boyfriend to stay with me over Thanksgiving even though my family isn't including him at dinner?,"My (28F) family is having Thanksgiving in my city, since both I and a distant relative (let's call her Lucy, 80F) and her kids live here (our extended family is very small, so even distant relatives are close). We're doing it at a restaurant.

My boyfriend of two years (28M) lives about an hour from me and across the country from his parents. He's going to be too busy with work to go all the way to his parents' house and back, so I asked if he could have dinner with us. (If it's relevant, my parents have met him a number of times, so he's not a stranger). I asked my parents first (making clear that I totally understood if they only wanted family at this dinner so they wouldn't feel bad about saying no), and they said they were fine with it if Lucy was. I then asked Lucy, and she said she was happy to include him. She made a strange comment about my father probably only wanting family present, but I assured her that I'd already asked him and he was fine with it. I told my boyfriend that he could come.

A few days later, Lucy texted me saying that my father (63M) told her that he didn't want any non-family present (no other partners are coming) and that he'd never heard anything about my boyfriend coming. This was, of course, a lie on his part. I texted back that I respect the decision, and it was probably just a misunderstanding. In fact, though, there's no way it was a misunderstanding. I think my father changed his mind (or maybe he thought Lucy was going to say no anyway and panicked when she said yes), but instead of just talking to me about it, he went behind my back. This is the sort of thing he does.

Obviously, my boyfriend is the real victim in this, because I had to uninvite him, and that of course hurt his feelings. I told him that if he wanted to, he could of course still come stay at my place over the holiday (my parents are staying in a hotel, not with me) so he wouldn't have to be alone, although I would understand if he didn't want to be anywhere near. He said he'd still come. We agreed that deep down we both kind of want my parents to find out that he's here so my father will feel bad for uninviting him from dinner, but we're definitely not going to make a big deal about it. I talked to an older friend about this whole situation, and she said he shouldn't come, and that I shouldn't try to guilt my parents.

WIll we be the assholes if he does come? I know ultimately it's up to him--he was the one who was hurt--but I'm just trying to get some clarity here.

Edit: Thanks for the replies. Some context: My sister and I are both low-contact with our parents, but we decided years ago that it was easier to just act cordial towards them the couple times a year that we see them than to waste energy confronting them about anything. My father will never change, and my mother is too disconnected from reality to ever see his bad behavior for what it is. In this case in particular I especially don't want to make a splash because I don't want to make things awkward and harm my relationship with Lucy.

My boyfriend knows what kind of people my parents are, and he knows my MO (keep them at arms length, but act pleasant when I do see them), so he wasn't all that surprised about what happened, and he was not upset about my decision to go to the dinner. 

""But you're choosing them over him."" Maybe in some sense...but it sounds a little odd to say that when he and I both know I do not care about my parents at all and am only doing this because it's my policy not to rock the boat. 

""But what if they started making demands about your wedding? Would you just accede so as not to rock the boat then?"" I generally don't see the use in taking stands ""on principle,"" but when it comes to things that actually matter to me and people I care about, I very much do not let my parents walk all over me. 

""Why don't you consider this Thanksgiving dinner something that matters to you and people you care about?"" I don't know--maybe I'm wrong, but it just doesn't seem like a big enough deal. ""But it's not about how you see it; it's about how your boyfriend sees it."" Yeah, but he doesn't seem too sad about it either, and he never suggested that he wanted me not to go. 

Sorry if that was too long winded or if it seemed defensive, but I just wanted to get all the context out. What do you guys think?",Everyone Sucks,2024-10-30,"WIBTA if I invite my boyfriend to stay with me over Thanksgiving even though my family isn't including him at dinner? My (28F) family is having Thanksgiving in my city, since both I and a distant relative (let's call her Lucy, 80F) and her kids live here (our extended family is very small, so even distant relatives are close). We're doing it at a restaurant.

My boyfriend of two years (28M) lives about an hour from me and across the country from his parents. He's going to be too busy with work to go all the way to his parents' house and back, so I asked if he could have dinner with us. (If it's relevant, my parents have met him a number of times, so he's not a stranger). I asked my parents first (making clear that I totally understood if they only wanted family at this dinner so they wouldn't feel bad about saying no), and they said they were fine with it if Lucy was.

11,1gfsys0,AITA for walking out of my sister's baby gender reveal party?,"My sister (37f) is expecting her first child and she decided to throw a gender reveal party to find out if they were having a boy or girl. We're not that close. She's a decade older than me (27f) and we're very different people so it's not a great combo. Plus my sister can be kind of spoiled and entitled. But still we're family and I knew my family would expect me to be there for this occasion so we (husband was also invited) went.

Some brief background... I have been pregnant four times but I have no living children. Three ended in miscarriage. One ended with my baby being stillborn. My stillborn child should be 1 now. But we don't get to see them grow up. My husband and I have taken a break to heal so we can be healthy parents if we are lucky enough to have more children.

When we got there it looked very much like they knew they were having a girl. There was so much pink. SO much. No blue. Which left us wondering why the gender reveal. When the time came for the reveal everyone found out my sister is expecting a boy. Her reaction was the reason I left. She got so hysterical and furious and she cursed and screamed that she wanted a girl, she was supposed to be having a girl and who the fuck was punishing her this way. Her husband looked equally upset by the reveal. I heard him say it was all bullshit and what a waste. My sister's temper tantrum saddened me and honestly sickened me as someone who would do anything for a child to raise. So we quietly left. But it was noticed.

My sister asked what the hell we ran off for without comforting her and I told her I could not. That her reaction was not something I could understand. She told me to save her from the outrage and how dare I judge her when she has every right to be upset her dream is ended and she's now left figuring out what to do with a boy. I told her given the losses I had faced I could not understand and I ended the call. She texted me saying I was a terrible sister. Then my parents called me to say I should have stayed and waited for any feelings until after. They also told me I should just be there for my sister now.

One of the most common ways to celebrate Diwali is by lightening firecrackers. I personally havent participated in this tradition and personally dont like it much. I cant breath properly (have to breath through mouth cause nose gets blocked sorta) in the smoke created by firecrackers and i hate loud noises plus its not exactly the environmentally friendly thing to do seeing the pollution. 

Now we come to the title. Some people from my building have been cracking the crackers since 8PM this evening and its well past 11 as i am writing this. Now i stay on the 1st floor (as our building is structured the 1st floor is actually the third floor above ground) and they are lighting these crackers right near my apartment. They are so loud that i am literally jumping out of my skin everytime one goes off.

Now for day 1 of diwali we have to get up, bathed and ready in festive clothes before 6:30 AM. And Day 1 is tommorow.

So i am starting to get annoyed by all the noise now and have a strong urge to go and yell at the neighbors to go the f home and sleep since some of us have to get up early in the morning.

13,1gfsojp,AITA for cutting back on family gifts,"I (44f) and my husband (50m) have twins (4f). My husband has one sibling and comes from a family that see each other often and don't exchange gifts. I have a brother and his wife who have four children (15,11,9 and 7). I am very aware of everything I purchase and hate waste/clutter but we also have a comfortable lifestyle. My brothers family have a comfortable lifestyle too. The issue I have is we have been clashing over gifts and I don't know if AITA.

The current situation is my brothers family buy myself, my husband and our twins birthday gifts to the amount of £200 total. And Christmas gifts it's the same again. I have let my SIL lead over the years and just matched what she spends roughly. Up until 4 years ago the dynamics were different as I didn't have children so they bought myself and my husband gifts while I bought each family member a gift in return.

The beginning of this year I spoke to my SIL as she is the gift buyer/organiser of their family. My proposal was that now we all have children why don't we just spend the budget on the children and omit the adults. I thought it would take out all the stress of trying to think of gifts for adults and buy things that neither any of us need. I admit I am not the best at thinking of gifts for people and usually end up buying a voucher of some kind to compensate. I also suggested when it was an adult birthday that it would be nicer to just meet up or go for food etc instead if a present. My SIL LOVES buying gifts for people and spending a lot of time and effort doing so. However the gifts for myself and my husband are usually things we never use or need.

Her response was that while she understood my perspective, she does indeed enjoy buying gifts for people so she would carry on doing so for the adults. She did say that I didn't have to do it and can do what I wanted. She said that she knows the gifts aren't always needed and she would have no problem if I regifted it or gave it to charity.

This year instead of splitting the budget equally between the 6 of them I spent 80% of it on the kids and still gave the adults a little something to honour their birthday. 3 of their birthdays all land this week. I get stressed every time trying to work out what to buy and I'll have to do it all again in a months time for Christmas. We have hardly seen each others families over the year due to school/work etc (maybe 3 times) and it just puts it into perspective for me as I'm dropping off gifts and putting it through their letterbox with zero interaction as they're too busy to see me/us. And I just feel it is such a pointless, cold process. Is this the normal process that everyone goes through and just a part of life that I need to accept? Just to add I do not grudge getting my nieces and nephews gifts but £400 a year seems excessive to me too.

15,1gfseww,AITA for possibly ruining friendships and a relationship?,"My bf (M, 21) and I (F, 21) went to a small apartment party thrown by my friend Anna and her roommates. Anna's roommate's close friend Sarah was there with her bf Steve. I've met them twice before, and they seemed great. They've been together for 5 years.

Steve was very touchy. Not in a creepy way, but definitely more than a guy with a gf should be IMO, especially bc I'm not close with them. But nobody said anything plus his gf was there, so I figured that's just his vibe and left it alone.

As the night went on, I noticed Steve was EXTREMELY touchy with Anna. He was hanging off of her and holding her hand when she was passed out asleep. (I watched and made sure nothing escalated, not saying it would've, but it's girl code).

He was more touchy with her than anyone else by far, including his gf. She isn't even one of their close friends. For context, Anna is curvy and beautiful, so she gets a lot of male attention, wanted or not.

But again, she seemed okay with it and so did everyone else.

Later, Steve kissed my bf. It was silly. I wasn't bothered by it and neither was my bf. But then I look over and Sarah is right there. She looks extremely sad and uncomfortable. She tried to play it off, but I noticed. Later, Sarah and I are talking and look over and see Steve hugging Anna from behind (Anna was VERY drunk). She once again plays it off, but her face is obvious.

The next morning, my bf relays a talk he had with Steve prior to the kiss. (Context: Steve and my bf are both often mistaken as bisexual.  Steve denies it, and my bf's just super comfortable in his masculinity.) Steve asked if he could admit if another man was attractive. Bf says sure, objectively. And Steve said he finds men attractive, but just isn't sure about ""butt stuff"". My bf walked away with the impression that Steve is interested in men, but isn't comfortable saying it.

At the end of the night, Sarah was trying to get Steve in the car. He was blatantly ignoring her, making a big scene of being drunk until Anna's female roommate was yelling at him to stop. Once my bf stood up and firmly told him to go (the only other straight man) he did. During the whole exchange Sarah looked so defeated and sad.

None of this is damning, but it was all just weird? It felt like he was using being drunk as an excuse to explore his sexuality and disrespect his partner with plausible deniability, even though it clearly makes her uncomfortable.

I called Anna today and told her. She said that he's always made her extremely uncomfortable. He's gotten drunk and tickled her, fireman carried her while she said stop, etc. and she always thought it was weird but since no one seemed fazed, she didn't want to overreact.

She told her roommate, and she's going to present all of this (my bf and Anna's sides) to Sarah so she can decide what to do.

But now I'm thinking. Am I overreacting? I don't want to ruin a friend group I'm not really in or someone else's relationship over  nothing. He doesn't seem like a bad person. AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for possibly ruining friendships and a relationship? My bf (M, 21) and I (F, 21) went to a small apartment party thrown by my friend Anna and her roommates. Anna's roommate's close friend Sarah was there with her bf Steve. I've met them twice before, and they seemed great. They've been together for 5 years.

Steve was very touchy. Not in a creepy way, but definitely more than a guy with a gf should be IMO, especially bc I'm not close with them. But nobody said anything plus his gf was there, so I figured that's just his vibe and left it alone.

As the night went on, I noticed Steve was EXTREMELY touchy with Anna. He was hanging off of her and holding her hand when she was passed out asleep. (I watched and made sure nothing escalated, not saying it would've, but it's girl code).

He was more touchy with her than anyone else by far, including his gf. She isn't even one of their close friends. For context, Anna is curvy and beautiful, so she gets a lot of male attention, wanted or not.

But again, she seemed okay with it and so did everyone else.

Later, Steve kissed my bf. It was silly. I wasn't bothered by it and neither was my bf. But then I look over and Sarah is right there. She looks extremely sad and uncomfortable. She tried to play it off, but I noticed. Later, Sarah and I are talking and look over and see Steve hugging Anna from behind (Anna was VERY drunk). She once again plays it off, but her face is obvious.

The next morning, my bf relays a talk he had with Steve prior to the kiss. (Context: Steve and my bf are both often mistaken as bisexual.  Steve denies it, and my bf's just super comfortable in his masculinity.) Steve asked if he could admit if another man was attractive. Bf says sure, objectively. And Steve said he finds men attractive, but just isn't sure about ""butt stuff"". My bf walked away with the impression that Steve is interested in men, but isn't comfortable saying it.

At the end of the night, Sarah was trying to get Steve in the car. He was blatantly ignoring her, making a big scene of being drunk until Anna's female roommate was yelling at him to stop. Once my bf stood up and firmly told him to go (the only other straight man) he did. During the whole exchange Sarah looked so defeated and sad.

None of this is damning, but it was all just weird? It felt like he was using being drunk as an excuse to explore his sexuality and disrespect his partner with plausible deniability, even though it clearly makes her uncomfortable.

17,1gfsdvw,AITA for coddling my daughter? ,"This is about my daughter “Amy” (18f). Amy got pregnant at 17 with her boyfriend “Matt” (19m). He was 18 at the time. She found out after he went away to college. He wanted to drop out, but she convinced him to stay in. He was there for the birth of his daughter “Rose”. 


Amy and Rose lived with us for two months before Matt and Amy decided to get married. She had already finished high school via virtual school. I begged her not to get married because they’re young and just now learning about being adults. I said she could go live with him, but to give marriage time. They decided against it. I offered them getting counseling beforehand. Amy said she’d think about it. 


They’ve been gone for a couple months. The communication was dwindling, but I figured she was busy as a mother/wife and had a part time job. They moved into a 3 bdrm apartment with one of Matt’s friends becoming a roommate to help out with bills. The communication continued to decrease so I sent a text apologizing if I did something wrong, but I’d love to hear from her. 


She called me last night explaining she wasn’t mad at me, but she felt confused. She feels alone and like she’s drowning. She said I coddled her too much after she had Rose. That I should’ve held her accountable and made her do more of the daily chores like washing bottles and pumps, washing their laundry, changing Rose’s diaper, feeding her, burping her, cleaning and cooking, letting Amy take naps and showers, etc.  She said she feels disappointed with Matt’s help, and would have been fine with it had I held her more accountable. 
 

I feel she has a point. Maybe I should’ve pointed out things that needed done rather than doing them. So AITA? Reposting this because they said I didn’t clarify why I thought I was the AH. 


Edit: I just wanted to post about Matt to add clarity. He’s helping. But when she was here, it was me and her dad helping. Matt’s still a new dad, and he’s not very confident in his parenting skills. If she cries, he feels like he must’ve done something wrong. Maybe he jostled her when he got up, maybe he didn’t support her head enough, maybe he was holding her too firmly, etc. But Amy said he’s trying. 

That’s why Amy said she wished I had made her do more. She wasn’t prepared for the workload that she’d have to pick up when we weren’t there. She said we just knew what to do and they don’t.

I got into the finals and the organization is printing one poem of their choosing from each finalist into a book, and they chose my second poem. when I read the poem to my mother for the first time though, she started crying and then explained that she understood it like I felt bad about our visit and eventually told me she didn't like the fact that her life was being exposed like that. 

I argued that literally nobody will know it's about a real-life situation, that it's my life too and I wrote it from my point of view without any direct mention of her, and, after all, she was the one who told me I could write about familial love and is complaining now that I actually did?

Before we started dating, I had a horrible 9-5 job that I was absolutely miserable at. My co-workers were assholes, and my boss was extremely sexist. On my down time, I began to write my first book. I've always loved writing and dreamed about being a real author someday.

Apparently, it was meant to be because after I finished my first book, it BLEW. UP. I was getting demands for a sequel (which I did write and published), and now I'm getting demands for the third and the mini series. (I won't list the book titles here, I'd like my personal stuff and work stuff to remain separate).

One day, my boyfriend looked at me and said, ""You make in a month what I make in a year."" He didn't say it maliciously, but it had me wondering if maybe he resented me a bit. I asked him, but he said he didn't. He said he was proud of me.
He even started helping me promote my books, and when I wrote my first non-fiction book, he said he was even more proud.

But lately, whenever the topic of money comes up, he gets really quiet and really moody. I've always told him it's not MY money, it's OUR money. I wouldn't be where I am today without his encouragement. I'd probably still be in that awful 9-5 job.

This started when he asked me for help with his car. He was behind a couple of payments, and obviously, I paid it. I don't drive, but he does take me wherever I need to go, so I chip in for gas, and of course, I'll make a payment if he can't. But now his brakes are going too. I told him to make an appointment and he said he can't afford it. I said, ""Don't worry about it, I'll take care of it."" He got super moody, and it bugged me a little.

It's been weeks, and he still hasn't made the appointment. I'm uncomfortable getting in the car now because I don't want the brakes to fail while I'm in there. I don't want the brakes to fail while HE'S in there! When I brought it up again, he said he'll make the appointment when he can afford it. I snapped and told him to just f*cking do it, the car needs to be safe.

I feel like he's actually starting to resent me because I make more money. He won't admit it, but he won't tell me what's actually wrong, either. Now, I feel I made things worse because I snapped at him. AITA? 

Edit to add:
I started writing my first book before we were dating. I would send him chapters and get his advice, so he was sort of my BETA reader and my ARC reader. I finally published the first book still before we were dating and started writing the second a couple of months later. And before this gets thrown out there, him and I never talked about finances when we were just friends. 
He had no idea how much I was making. Unlike my family, who I've more or less cut off because they would use me for money and then treat me like shit the rest of the time, or be really horrible if I said no. In the year we've been dating, I've only wrote my non-fiction book which is relatively short, and am in the process of writing the third installment to my series and starting on the mini series for 2026.

26,1gfqsd2,AITA for not providing any kind of extra support for my kids other household?,"I have two children (11f and 8m) with my ex and we share physical and legal custody of them. I pay child support because I'm a higher earner than my ex and the child support is minimal ($150 monthly) but is supposed to help balance things between both homes.

My ex is married again and her family has grown. In the house with her are her husband, his three children (under 10) and their two shared children (under 5).

My ex and her husband struggle financially and have attempted to increase child support five times in the last four years. The courts turned down their request for more child support each time. Twice in front of a judge and the other times we did not make it before a judge before it was denied. My ex was reminded that child support is meant to provide for our kids, not for her family as a whole. My ex argued that the financial burden impacts them but this was not deemed worthy of a child support increase. They were looking for an increase to make it $800 a month. 

My ex has independently asked me to give her $50 here and there. Or to buy stuff for the other children in her home. This happens even when our children are in my home. I always say no. I have told my ex that I am not responsible for supporting her other children and will never provide for them financially. 

Recently this became a more intense issue on their side because our daughter's birthday and her youngest stepchild's birthday are a week apart and our daughter had a great time and got gifts at both my house and her mom's and she had a big birthday party that I hosted. While my ex's stepchild didn't get much and had no party (they could not afford one). I had been asked twice to send some gifts for the other child. My ex also wanted the other kids invited, my daughter didn't so they weren't invited. It pissed my ex off. But then her stepkids lunch accounts went into the negative days after the birthdays were both over and since I topped up our kids, she wanted me to do it for her stepkids and I said no again.

She called me a monster and asked how I could live with myself knowing my children's other family are struggling and are literally drowning in financial difficulty and I could help out but choose not to.

27,1gfqpfi,AITA for needing to stay at a hotel w/ my fiancé for my mental health during our holiday visit to my MIL?,"I'll try to make this concise. My MIL is nice, but absurdly needy and passive aggressive. We live about 7 hours from her, only see her a few times year. 



I have diagnosed anxiety. I am anxious and uncomfortable staying the night at *anyone*'s house (including my best girl friends, my own close family, etc.), and I also have a low social battery, meaning I can tolerate only so much social interaction before I become worn out, stressed, overwhelmed, etc. These facts, combined with the general stress of the holidays *and* the stress from having to interact with my MIL (and *her* own undiagnosed/untreated anxieties) has left my fiancé and I to compromising to figure out the best way to handle visiting his family during the holidays, as we usually stay at my MIL's home which has been highly stressful for us in the past.

  
In couple's therapy, we came to the conclusion that it may be best to stay at a hotel nearby my MIL, that way I can have my own separate space to retreat to when needed/at the end of the day to unwind and manage my anxiousness, but we will still be able to visit as we normally do. The only difference is we are not staying with my MIL at her house.

  
MIL is very upset about this. She lives in a really old house that isn't the nicest, but she's worked to make it as nice as possible for visitors. She is also used to having my fiancé stay with her whenever he is in town. MIL has two sons, but my fiancé is the only one who is unmarried and without kids at this point, so a lot of obligations from her fall on him. We've tried explaining to her that this is what I need personally to help with my mental wellbeing, but she's just can't get over the fact that we won't stay with her. She is offended, upset and hurt.



I don't want to hurt her feelings, and am tempted to just say fuck it, let's stay with her to alleviate her being upset and not have to deal with her fit (which is in turn making my fiancé upset, and having his brother text him bugging him about ""mom being hurt/upset"" - the guilt is being laid on **thick**), but I feel like this goes exactly against what we've been learning in therapy related to boundary setting with our families of origin. MIL definitely has enmeshment issues with her kids, but fiancé and I haven't been as effected since we live far away.

  
My fiancé 100% backs my feelings and prioritizes my needs - he supports me fully in staying at a hotel. The way his family is responding is making me feel like an asshole, though. We are engaged, and I am still working to build relationships with his side of the family, and it hurts to think that this may warp their views of me. No one wants to come across as overly sensitive and difficult, but that's how their reactions are making me feel.

28,1gfqmfz,AITA for restricting my brother,"Just need a reality check here. We are about to go down and talk with my Brother who is 41, living off of my father who is 71 on social security and has a small recurring income from a property rented out. 

Now for the rundown.

How did we get here? My father was having some health issues while living with my brother that spiraled down into disasterous consequences. Unable to walk, soiling himself, and various other issues. Some of this was my father drinking and my brother joining him for smoke times. I could care less for my father he is retired and should be looked after. The problem, he wasn't. My brother uses him like a bank account, doesn't hold a job, doesn't look after him, and even when he was finally taken to the ER my god father took him, not my brother. He didn't help him get to appointments, checck on him, or do various other items. I got a call coming back from a trip since my father missed our weekly breakfast meetings saying he didn't feel well or ill which i asked him if he went to the doctor or had gone. While i thought he was, i later found out he had not been making them and just covering things.

The path to now. ER to Rehad my brother only visited my father to collect money and grab lunch with him overr a span of 4-6 weeks maybe 2 visits. While we were visiting him dailly, getting him needed items, and starting to take over and get all his accounts in order. After he was in rehad and fully conscious he signed over Power of Attorney and numerous items to me as well as jointing me on accts ect... We are taking him to the dentist to get his dentures done, getting him to the doctor getting him fixed up, and moved him up to our property using his money for the building but using our own money to clear and get everything else in order for him. I moved money off his accounts to my name for my father, made him a checking which he has free reign too and agreed to basically spending money in cash as needed with no card, and started cleaning out all the excess charges from his old accounts finalizing a closure soon so ultimate unncessaries are gone. He can't fully walk or get around yet, but we are working on that verifying with the doctor before releasing him back to the roads.

The problem now. Things cost money. With dentures, the ER, Rehab, moving, my brothers various spending on his card, and getting his affairs in order money has been hemmoriging from $110k now to close to sub $20k. Plumbing issues, insect issues, and things where they had not taken care of the house he was at my brother currently lives. We are sitting down soon to basically trim off my brother with a 2 month heads up the card is shutting down,, he needs to get a job, we are taking back my fathers car, and as long as he does have a job, ,he will get a car so long as he can pay insurance and gas ect...

30,1gfpy3h,AITA for being uncomfortable with my boyfriend's friends,"Okay so lets start with this: I am a 21yo female dating a 26yo male
Lets call him CD

So CD and I have been dating for about a year now and its been a rocky year. For context CD has a severe anxiety disorder and doesnt have a lot of friends he hangs around with

We used to work at the same place and long story short I was fired for speaking out on unfair treatment of all employees and also for reporting to one of the manager (lets call her Jelly) that someone in a position of power in the company had done some very bad things to me which I won't mention here. Jelly than proceeded to tell that person to ""be careful because the women were speaking out more about this kind of stuff"" and they could get in trouble. Which in turns led to them threathening me to make my life hell and so long story short I had a breakdown and got fired.

Now, CD knows this whole situation and still works at that place. Recently, Jelly asked him to go to a concert with her. Which normally I wouldnt have minded if it wasnt for the fact it was Jelly. He accepted and told me later on.

So last night we were having a conversation about it and I mentioned that it made me unconfortable that he was going to do an activity with her. At first he replied that he was just hanging with her because they work together but when I brought back what she had done to me, he replied with "" well I dont know, I work with her and she's nice. She's my friend."" 

I then argued that while I understood that he needed to be cordial to her in work settings as she is his boss, he didnt have to be friends with her knowing she hurt me a lot. 

In my mind if someone hurts someone I care about that much, I wont go around hanging out with them 

He then closed the conversation by saying he doesnt get why he should feel guilty for doing what he likes with a friend and that I was overreacting to it saying ""you always have to make things complicated"" and that I should know that he doesnt have a lot of friends so he should take activities as they go.

That made me doubt myself a lot. I'm thinking I mightve come off a bit controlling, rude or complicated by trying to tell him not to hangout with her

Should I apologize?
Am I the asshole ?

He then closed the conversation by saying he doesnt get why he should feel guilty for doing what he likes with a friend and that I was overreacting to it saying ""you always have to make things complicated"" and that I should know that he doesnt have a lot of friends so he should take activities as they go.

That made me doubt myself a lot. I'm thinking I mightve come off a bit controlling, rude or complicated by trying to tell him not to hangout with her

Should I apologize?
Am I the asshole ?

32,1gfpeeh,"AITA for showing my friend how to set a timer on his son's computer to make him get off it by a certain time, making his son be angry at me?","This happened two weeks ago, and I do think that I am an asshole in showing it to him and making his son be really ticked off at me.

My(55 F) friend (35 M) has a 10 year old son, who for the past month on the weekends would go beyond his curfew of 9 pm to get off the computer and get ready for bed by 10 pm. He would get off the computer like around midnight but in the middle of the night, my friend would hear his son's computer turn on around 3 am.

I went over to bring him some boxes as he and his son are moving to a new apartment in a new city in three weeks. While we were sitting down and drinking coffee and shooting the breeze about the joys of moving, thankfully, he had paid vacation time and PTO that he hadn't used up yet. He made mention about his son on the weekends staying up past his 9 pm curfew on getting off the computer to get ready for bed and then hearing him get up in the middle of the night to play on the computer.

I made an offhand suggestion about setting a timer for his computer to turn off. He looked at me like I grew two heads. He asked is that even possible?

I was like yeah, just look on the computer. We had to look up how to put it on, by googling it. He never knew he could set a timer for the computer to turn off. He even googled if it was possible to set the timer to allow the computer to be turned on, I didn't even think that was possible, till we found it on google.

So we got the son's computer set to turn off at 9 pm and wake up at 6 am.

He was very proud of himself for setting it up. I had told him that his son will get used to the boundaries now. Do tell him the consequences of his actions has warranted a new punishment if he doesn't follow curfew by getting off the computer by 9 pm.

Well, I got a phone call that night from my friend, his son was ticked off about his computer turning off at 9 pm. I could hear his son screaming at him for being a bad father and that he's going to be reported for this at school. I told him, the school won't do anything beyond asking what you did, might want to drop him off and go speak with the principal about this, so whatever your son tries to get you into trouble, would be canceled out by you talking to the principal and the teacher probably would be sent a message pertaining to him so he cannot get you into any trouble since this happens at the library and at our school computers too.

My friend asked me if we did the right thing by doing this to him. I told him we did the right thing, he has to learn how to make due with the time he has on the computer before it shuts down, like he has to when he goes to the public library on Saturday, as the computers there shuts down at 4:45 pm.

His son has been constantly screaming at him for allowing me to destroy his computer time, and it is constant for the last two weeks.

My dad got up in her face and my step grandfathers face, as he was agreeing and spewing the same stuff she was to him, and told them both to get out. My mother told me all about this and I swore them off. 

Now, when it comes to the funeral, I do not want to go. She never apologized about what she said, she’s never done anything “grandmotherly” towards me (never showed up to events and if she did it was some type of political argument), she’s never been there when I needed someone, even refused to babysit me and my siblings when my mom literally was dying of cancer. 

However, my mother still wants me to go to see everyone and to not hold a grudge. The funerals are for the living and she thinks I’ll be just as bad if I let hate cloud my decision to say goodbye.

37,1gfo6kk,AITA for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes? ,"Am I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes? 

Me (23) and my boyfriend (25) started dating April of 2023. We have known each other since I was 14 and he was the guy to take me on my first date. Our teen age years we disconnected but always checked in with each other over the years. When I was 15yr I moved to SC with my mother from TN and finished high school. When i was 19-20 years old I moved back to TN with my father and his family. 

My father (56) and mother (53) separated by the time I was 2yrs old. I mainly have always lived with my mother, but I was at a point within my life where I was going down the wrong path. August of 2020, I moved states and began living with my father because I knew it would bring the structure I needed during that point in time. During this time, I started online college, got a under paying job, and just stayed to myself most of the time. Now my father was in the military and growing up he could be rough on us kids. When he remarried, he now has 5 more children ranging in ages between (9-3), with this he has become a lot more chilled out than previous years. 

He and my stepmother are financially well off, yearly vacations, nice cars, hosting family get togethers. Since he was previously in the military, I was able to use a grant to help me go to college. With this money we used it to pay for a car that was under my stepmom's name (that I drove) while I paid for school completely out of pocket. They did not charge me rent but in return I would clean house, babysat almost daily while he ran earns and when she was working (at home). I also helped with the two German Shepards they had. (They used to breed them). If I was not at work, I was at home doing schoolwork (normally while watching the baby), cleaning, or taking out dogs. I am so thankful for them and hated to complain about anything because of everything they did for me. 

While living there I began to get lonely, I did not have friends in my hometown anymore and the ones I did have, my parents would not let me go see and would get upset if I spoke to them. Other than being at home I really did not have a social life anymore. When I hit 21, I did start going out to the pub on Fridays and they honestly would let me go most weekends which lasted a few months. 

That is when my boyfriend came back into the picture. During all of this we would stay in touch. In 2021 he actually met my dad, but he had just gone through a bad break up and he did not want that to affect the way my family and I myself would view him. 

When we did actually become a couple, my family liked him a lot. They saw that he cared about me and I for him. He worked out of town so EVERY weekend he would make the 4-hour drive to come see me and the 4-hour drive back to work. I traded going out every weekend to him coming over, me going to his dads to just hang out for 4-5 hours at night. (We were not allowed to stay the night with each over for the first 5-6 months of us dating. I had a curfew by 1 am or he had to leave by 2am. In October of 2023 he went on an Orlando Disney Trip with my whole family and in my option it went amazing. Once we got home my dad and stepmom started saying things about him that honestly I did not agree with. 

My boyfriend isn't the type to hold open doors, and he normally did wait to see me go inside the house, except we lived in a nice neighborhood at you had to turn around and go back by the house to leave the neighborhood. On his way back out I would turn my bedroom light on, so he knew I was completely inside. (He would stop in front of my house if it wasn't) He even left his out-of-town job to be closer to me even if he was taking a huge pay cut. We occasionally went out drinking together and he always drove. He would never drink as much as me since he had to drive me back home. One night we went out and saw his brother that he had not seen in years and their dad ended up coming along. We both ended up getting extremely drunk, His dad followed us to my house, I took the dogs out (Forgot the lock the cage completely) and we both passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to my dad yelling at us to turn off the alarm that we both slept through and him telling me to get my ass downstairs cause one of the dogs got out into the garage and chewed up a bunch of stuff. He asked me if my boyfriend drove me home drunk and I told the truth about exactly want happened. When dad went upstairs and asked him, he lied saying he didn't drink and drive with me. After this he never came over again and I now had to be back from his house by 11pm. I understood because it was dangerous, and my BF completely understood too. For the next 2 months it was like this, my parents talking bad about him even after he tried multiple time apologizing. He stopped drinking completely for 6 months because of that night. He even warned me that my parents were going to tell me to either leave him or get out the house. I honestly never thought they would have just because of a bad choice and after everything we had been through. 

The night after Christmas of 2023, my stepmom looked at me and said, ""If you are choosing to stay with him you need to hurry up and pack your things to leave."" I had a complete melt down to say the least, I called my BF who also started freaking out. I was going to leave him, but I honestly could not do it. I see myself marrying this man, having his children. After all of this time I finally had someone in my life where I could be myself without being corrected or put down. 

I tried to go talk to my dad about him and he said, "" Out of all the things me and (stepmom) changed about you, the one thing we can't change is your shitty taste in men.""  Not to mention him bringing up that he could not take care of me later on in life because he is an amputee and is missing his left foot to lower leg from an accident, he was in at 2 years old. We continued the conversation, and I honestly said some hurtful things like "" maybe if you were actually in my life as a kid Id know what that is."" (Him and my birth mother cheated on each other heavily when I came into the picture.) He was also always gone on duty; I maybe saw him 1-2 times a year until I was 11. I still feel horrible about my choice of words and still to this day get upset thinking about it. 

I ended up leaving that night and have lived with my boyfriend since. Parents sold the car I drove, and I never saw any of the money from it. (That was being paid for with my school grant.) Had to drop out with only 9 credits to go since I could not afford the 5K a semester. The first four months we lived at his dad's trailer, and I would remember my stepmom saying, "" If you want to be trailer park trash then go ahead and go."" We ended up moving back to SC to work for the company he did previously. 

We now live in a beautiful 3-bedroom house, have a dog together and I just bought a new 2024 Hyundai that had 5k miles on it. Honestly for being 23 and 25 we are doing really well for ourselves. We both make fantastic money together. He pays most of the bills and just lets my worry about my own personal bills and utilities. He wants me to be able to save up to go back to school since he knows how passionate I am about finishing. I tried calling my father on holidays, his birthday, and went to a funeral to a family member he was extremely close to so I could be there to support him (his wife was not there) as I expected. Not once has he called me (other than a butt dial) to check in on me, see if I am doing okay, said Happy Birthday or just see if I am okay after Helen. 

I know this is a super long post, but I wanted to be completely transparent about this situation. I still feel horrible about the whole situation. My father is a great man, he has done so much for our country, and I would not ask for a different father. He has done more than expected for me after I turned 18. He did not have to take me back in and support me while I was going through a hard time but I starting to feel resentful because he has not reached out whatsoever in 10 almost 11 months. I also am so deeply in love with my man. He supports everything I do, never once has cussed me, put my down or spoken bad about my family. He incredibly hard working, even with his disadvantage in life. Not once has he ever let that hold him back. He grew up in extremely difficult circumstances, including being homeless at 17 after his family lost his childhood home. Everything we have today is because he has never given up on himself or us.

Am I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes? ",TL;DR,2024-10-30,"AITA for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes?  Am I the Asshole for choosing my BF (25) against my father's wishes? 

Me (23) and my boyfriend (25) started dating April of 2023. We have known each other since I was 14 and he was the guy to take me on my first date. Our teen age years we disconnected but always checked in with each other over the years. When I was 15yr I moved to SC with my mother from TN and finished high school. When i was 19-20 years old I moved back to TN with my father and his family. 

My father (56) and mother (53) separated by the time I was 2yrs old. I mainly have always lived with my mother, but I was at a point within my life where I was going down the wrong path. August of 2020, I moved states and began living with my father because I knew it would bring the structure I needed during that point in time. During this time, I started online college, got a under paying job, and just stayed to myself most of the time. Now my father was in the military and growing up he could be rough on us kids. When he remarried, he now has 5 more children ranging in ages between (9-3), with this he has become a lot more chilled out than previous years. 

He and my stepmother are financially well off, yearly vacations, nice cars, hosting family get togethers. Since he was previously in the military, I was able to use a grant to help me go to college. With this money we used it to pay for a car that was under my stepmom's name (that I drove) while I paid for school completely out of pocket. They did not charge me rent but in return I would clean house, babysat almost daily while he ran earns and when she was working (at home). I also helped with the two German Shepards they had. (They used to breed them). If I was not at work, I was at home doing schoolwork (normally while watching the baby), cleaning, or taking out dogs. I am so thankful for them and hated to complain about anything because of everything they did for me. 

While living there I began to get lonely, I did not have friends in my hometown anymore and the ones I did have, my parents would not let me go see and would get upset if I spoke to them. Other than being at home I really did not have a social life anymore. When I hit 21, I did start going out to the pub on Fridays and they honestly would let me go most weekends which lasted a few months. 

That is when my boyfriend came back into the picture. During all of this we would stay in touch. In 2021 he actually met my dad, but he had just gone through a bad break up and he did not want that to affect the way my family and I myself would view him. 

When we did actually become a couple, my family liked him a lot. They saw that he cared about me and I for him. He worked out of town so EVERY weekend he would make the 4-hour drive to come see me and the 4-hour drive back to work. I traded going out every weekend to him coming over, me going to his dads to just hang out for 4-5 hours at night. (We were not allowed to stay the night with each over for the first 5-6 months of us dating. I had a curfew by 1 am or he had to leave by 2am. In October of 2023 he went on an Orlando Disney Trip with my whole family and in my option it went amazing. Once we got home my dad and stepmom started saying things about him that honestly I did not agree with. 

My boyfriend isn't the type to hold open doors, and he normally did wait to see me go inside the house, except we lived in a nice neighborhood at you had to turn around and go back by the house to leave the neighborhood. On his way back out I would turn my bedroom light on, so he knew I was completely inside. (He would stop in front of my house if it wasn't) He even left his out-of-town job to be closer to me even if he was taking a huge pay cut. We occasionally went out drinking together and he always drove. He would never drink as much as me since he had to drive me back home. One night we went out and saw his brother that he had not seen in years and their dad ended up coming along. We both ended up getting extremely drunk, His dad followed us to my house, I took the dogs out (Forgot the lock the cage completely) and we both passed out. 

The next morning, I woke up to my dad yelling at us to turn off the alarm that we both slept through and him telling me to get my ass downstairs cause one of the dogs got out into the garage and chewed up a bunch of stuff. He asked me if my boyfriend drove me home drunk and I told the truth about exactly want happened. When dad went upstairs and asked him, he lied saying he didn't drink and drive with me. After this he never came over again and I now had to be back from his house by 11pm. I understood because it was dangerous, and my BF completely understood too. For the next 2 months it was like this, my parents talking bad about him even after he tried multiple time apologizing. He stopped drinking completely for 6 months because of that night. He even warned me that my parents were going to tell me to either leave him or get out the house. I honestly never thought they would have just because of a bad choice and after everything we had been through. 

The night after Christmas of 2023, my stepmom looked at me and said, ""If you are choosing to stay with him you need to hurry up and pack your things to leave."" I had a complete melt down to say the least, I called my BF who also started freaking out. I was going to leave him, but I honestly could not do it. I see myself marrying this man, having his children. After all of this time I finally had someone in my life where I could be myself without being corrected or put down. 

I tried to go talk to my dad about him and he said, "" Out of all the things me and (stepmom) changed about you, the one thing we can't change is your shitty taste in men.""  Not to mention him bringing up that he could not take care of me later on in life because he is an amputee and is missing his left foot to lower leg from an accident, he was in at 2 years old. We continued the conversation, and I honestly said some hurtful things like "" maybe if you were actually in my life as a kid Id know what that is."" (Him and my birth mother cheated on each other heavily when I came into the picture.) He was also always gone on duty; I maybe saw him 1-2 times a year until I was 11. I still feel horrible about my choice of words and still to this day get upset thinking about it. 

I ended up leaving that night and have lived with my boyfriend since. Parents sold the car I drove, and I never saw any of the money from it. (That was being paid for with my school grant.) Had to drop out with only 9 credits to go since I could not afford the 5K a semester. The first four months we lived at his dad's trailer, and I would remember my stepmom saying, "" If you want to be trailer park trash then go ahead and go."" We ended up moving back to SC to work for the company he did previously.

39,1gfnxx8,AITA for not helping my friend who smoked too much ?,"So I recently 21F and my friend also 21F made plans to go out I picked the bar and pick her up. We get to the place and before going in we smoke a little bit. Now I consider my self a stoner I smoke very regularly. My friend on the other hand hasn’t smoked in many months barely even a drinker. Yes I am aware of this I ask her if she’s sure she says yes she takes about two hits and a few minutes later she’s freaking out. I mention to her that the bar won’t be packed so no one is going to be watching us. ( her biggest concern was people looking at us while sitting at the bar. She views sitting at bars as an older man thing and thought we would be judged for being there ) She hears bar and doesn’t like it immediately she starts complaining. This annoys me because she knew we were coming to this bar all day. And I am someone who has been waitingggg on moments like this so I double down and tell her she can sit at a table but I will sit at the bar. 

I give her 20 mins in the car to sit and calm down but then I tell her I’m not waiting any longer and she needs to get up. We get to the bar and she can’t find her id which she just had in the car. Now she’s suggesting getting a table and I honestly ignore her because at this point I believe it’s on purpose. after I get a drink we leave the bar and hit a different place and everything calms down from there to have a pretty ok night. I did explain to her how I don’t feel comfortable smoking around her anytime soon since this was actually something I was looking forward to and I’m not a nurturing person and I’ve never got anxiety from smoking so I truly don’t know how that feels. She apologized and said she understood I dropped her off and we called it a night aita? 

TLDR: my friend smoked too much and started freaking out. I didn’t do much to help and looking back I feel bad and felt like I could have done more maybe ?? 

EDIT: I WAS NOT DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE IN ANYPART OF THIS STORY sorry maybe I should have made it clear this all happened in the same area when I talk about going to different places I mean we walked to the bar down the road and sat for a couple hours then I drove her home idk I felt like the story was getting lengthy so I just left that out.

42,1gfnb0y,AITA for reacting badly to my father's opinion,"Me (24M) and my father haven't had any relationship since he left home when I was 11. I learnt to live without him, however, a few months ago I started to miss him, and after thinking about it for days, I called him. We decided to meet. It went great and since then we are seeing each other often. I went to his house and met his gf. I love her, she is a very sweet woman. She heard my worries and supported me. I am diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and somehow she made me feel comfortable enough to open up.

I need to put you in context: I don't have a good relationship with my mom, she doesn't work and I am the one paying bills. My financial situation is bad, but I managed to save up for a trip this December. My gf lives far away and we can only see each other twice a year. I planned many months ago to go visit her this December. The flight and hoteal are already paid for ($302). I explained it to my father and his gf, telling them how excited I was.

Now this is what happened. I have had my cat for 16 years. I love her, I was 8 when we found her in the street. Last Sunday she looked bad. She didn't walk well, kept falling. My father came with me to the vet. They said my cat had some neurological problem and they need to do some tests to find out what exactly it is... which cost AT LEAST $540 (it will keep going up). I can't pay it because I don't have any help at home. My mother isn't willing to pay anything because she doesn't care. She has even stolen money from me to smoke. I told my father I'd see what I can do. Everything seemed fine, till he texted me at night that I had my priorities wrong, he found it offensive I was going to pay for a trip to visit my gf, but not the vet. I explained him the trip is already paid, and even with that extra money, I wouldn't have enough. Don't get me wrong though, I'm going to do something about it, working overtime or pay in installments. I felt hurt with his comment because he knows how excited I am and he talked about it in a very cold way. I said I was hurt. He was talking badly about something that is important to me. I just want to spend time with the person I love the most. But I felt like a selfish person for paying for a flight. The argument got worse.

44,1gfmzxq,AITA for bringing my boyfriend to friend group plans?,"I (27F) got into a serious relationship with my BF (30M) about 3mths ago. I had a best-friend (29M) (Sam) - he and I hung out almost every weekend (at most we met 3x a week). We are also part of a friend group. Sam is gay - he is only into men and I am female. 

Since entering the relationship with BF, I spend most free-times and weekends with my BF.  I introduced BF to Sam (and the friend group) and in total they met about 3-4 times. The interactions they had were minimal as it was all in group settings. The interactions were good and BF got along with my friends.

After they “met”, Sam began telling me and everyone about how he doesn’t like BF, and that he didn’t approve of the relationship. He sent essay-length messages with reasons as to why BF was not suitable for me. I never raised any concerns to warrant these reasons, so I don’t know where Sam got them from. 

As time went on, Sam kept making more passive aggressive and snarky comments about BF and my relationship. One time, Sam got very annoyed when he found out I was hanging out with my BF two-nights in a row. A friend told me that Sam was messaging her that he didn’t like BF and made some insulting comments  about me. Other friends also came forward to tell me that Sam was negatively gossiping about me/BF.

One day,  I messaged the group chat to make plans for a group dinner. Sam asked “Is BF joining?” I responded with “yes - are you going to ask this every time?” to which he responded “I will not be joining if he comes. And yes I’ll ask everytime, because I don’t like him.”

At this point I had enough and got very upset at his constant disrespect to me in public (group chat) and we ended up having a big argument over private DM, and I basically said to Sam:

1. BF is going to remain in my life, so he will join me to a lot of group plans. Sam did not have to like him but I would no longer tolerate any rude and disrespectful comments made to me or BF. 
2. Sam needs to stop being disrespectful to me and BF by actively excluding him.   

Sam basically said back to me:

1. I was being disrespectful to him for bringing BF into my life(??) and bringing him to plans without asking him whether it was ok first. 
2. He only wants to hang out with me or friends in our group and does not want ‘outsiders’ to join. 

I called bullshit on his last point - our friend group had grown as a result of meeting new people and Sam had no issue with another friend’s partner joining in on group plans. 

I asked Sam why he hates BF so much, and he says he just doesn’t like him for me and that we seem too different for each other.

Everyone else in the friend group has remained neutral and have made no comments. Everyone (except Sam) likes BF and we have hung out in a group a few times.

After a week of no-contact since the fight, Sam blocked me on social media, and removed himself from group chats (he probably made a separate group chats excluding me).

Despite my efforts to explain that I’m a deep sleeper, my stepdad accused me of being lazy and ungrateful. He threatened to raise my rent significantly and claimed I’d never find a cheaper place. Out of frustration, I found an apartment online that was cheaper than what I was paying them.

47,1gfm2nj,AITA in this relationship?,"Keep in mind: Late teens

Was in a relationship for about 1.5years, the first year was fine, everything went well. However I did have an underlying feeling that she was just in the relationship to make more friends with my other friends.

Fast forward to the next year, I couldn't help but notice she started distancing herself away, i.e I asked for PDA such as hugs or even just some hand holding, but they always had excuses such as ""Oh I cant because titles""(despite pretty much everyone already knew). Yet despite this she was okay with skinship with other boys.

This goes on, further to her not even sparing any time for us to go out together, yet when she, her friend group, and some of my friends plans an outing she has millions of time for it.

Feeling unappreciated, I did ask her about it and she said ""Im trying to fix it so match my vibes"" yet she never made an effort and continued as usual blaming ""Oh im very emotional"". (From my perspective it looked like she wasn't even trying at all). 

This is just me being sensitive, but:
We once had matching pfps on our socials but I decided to take it off for a while to see what she would do, but after saying like ""oh you dont wanna match anymore?"" She used a picture of my friend(a boy) like around the day after.

Anyways, this goes on for a few months until I couldn't take it anymore and just broke up.

This is extra bit of info but try not to let it affect your judgement:

After the breakup, I admit I said quite the harsh words to her as I felt very disrespected and unappreciated, but guess what, less than two weeks apart(in my guesstimate) she's now dating my friend (the boy she set her pfp to).

I did feel this somewhat happening(like she was going after my ""friends"" instead) as she would always hang out with my ""friends"" instead of me and when I asked her ""Am I not your friend?""(When we were still together) She just replied with ""No cause titles"".

Im happy for them they get their typical romeo saves juliet after breakup story atleast but I wanted to ask for clearance on my side;

52,1gfji5r,AITA for walking away?,"AITA? I (43f) live with my partner (41m) and my daughter (15f), close to my parents. Six years ago, after separating from my daughter’s father (we were together 18 years, married for 10), I relied heavily on my parents, especially my mom. She supported me emotionally and financially, helped with childcare, and was there for me through the difficult transition. Moving closer to them strengthened our bond, and she helped by doing some cleaning and feeding my daughter after school while I worked. When I met my current partner, she continued helping with my daughter after school, but I started to regain my independence.

My partner has bipolar disorder, which has brought some challenges, including job instability and a period of heavy drinking that led us to briefly separate. He eventually found the right support for his mental health and drinking, and we reconnected, enjoying a stable relationship for the last two years. My mother, however, disapproved of our reunion and distanced herself for five months, only reconnecting when she faced a cancer diagnosis. Although strained, we were working on our relationship, and I accepted her leaning on my sister for support through her treatment.

Ten months later, she went into remission and began feeling better. She returned to helping around my home, doing light cleaning and ironing, which I expressed was unnecessary but appreciated. Her involvement, though, started to feel possessive. She began reprimanding me over cleaning choices, insisting she handle my daughter's bedding, and becoming critical of small tasks.

Things escalated when my partner, who had recently lost his job, picked up laundry from my daughter’s room. My mother took this as an insult and accused him of spitefulness. A major argument ensued, and despite my attempts to set boundaries and explain there was no ill intent, she insisted on controlling aspects of our household tasks. When I got up to leave, she followed me, physically shoving me out and telling me not to return. I haven’t been back in two weeks.

Now, I’m questioning whether I should have backed down, as she’s unwell and undergoing tests to determine if her symptoms are post-chemo or something more serious. My partner thinks she’s being narcissistic and dramatic and says I shouldn’t apologize, especially as I usually end up doing so regardless of who’s at fault.

So, I’m 15 Years old (Male) and my brother is 16.He doesn’t like me and openly brags about it. Everytime we’re together at a family reunion he always belittles me and makes everyone laugh this way. Of course, it hurts, but je doesn’t even care. It wasn’t always this way: up until 2020, we lived eachother very much and always did things together, whereas now he’s always trying not to talk to me. I also have a younger sister (9) and he absolutely loves her; they always play, read, talk and go outside together. But with me it just isn’t the same. He simply hates me. 
The quote-unquote breaking point was last week. I was meant to go to my uncle with my mom and sister but in the end I didn’t want to go because I had too much homework. So when my brother found out about this, he got very angry. We had an argument and said the same things as always: that he doesn’t like and never dit, etc…
I forgot to mention this but I do everything within the house: I cook for my family, I take care of my sister’s homework, I always do the laundry and the dishes, I clean the house with the mop amongst others…. 
So, during the argument, he lied about how I never do the chores around the house, the argument got heated and he punched me (Which isn’t all too uncommon with him). I told my parents ans they all dismissed it, saying it was just quarrels between teens (it most likely is but still not an excuse to hit your brother). So I decided to stop doing the chores, and now all my family is overwhelmed, especially because he was always lazy, and whenever my brother tells me to do something, I don’t.

I (18F) recently joined a new friend group at my high school after my old friend group fell apart because of growing distance and past friendship dramas. My current group is small and tight knit, with about 7 people in total including me.

My friend group has about 7people in total including me. Amber, Lucy, Celine, me, Claudia and Wendy. Most of the group, including me, shared the same hobbies of swimming, drawing comics and reading books. Recently though, I picked up a new hobby of creative writing, specifically fanfiction. I knew about platforms such a Wattpad, FFN and AO3 and decided to ask a friend outside of my school, who is an avid writer on the platforms.

After the friend had introduced me to some beautiful AO3 fanfictions and how the platform worked in general, I fell down the rabbit hole of fanfiction, due to its creativity and the amazing writing quality of the authors, hence I felt inspired to try and write a fanfiction of my own. I wanted to give it a shot because 1) it's good writing practice and 2) It just seemed fun, though I admit I did want to get a bit of publicity on AO3, before trying to write some original content.

I thought a bit about what fandoms to write about and I tried to think of really big fandoms to gain publicity, such as Harry Potter, BNHA etc. But I wasn't interested in those fandoms and I didn't want to write a fanfiction about a fandom I didn't care about, so another idea came to mind. Since I was a huge KPOP listener, I decided, why not try writing a KPOP fanfiction? I wouldn't have to worry about writing out of character and the fandom was big enough to get a lot of constructive criticism and traction.

When I had told my friends that I was writing a fanfiction though, they asked about the fandom and I said ""Stray Kids"", as they are my favourite group right now. This is where I might be the AH. When they asked about the plot, I told them it was a fantasy/horror AU with a bit of chemistry between the two MCS, Han and Leeknow. I emphasised that there was nothing sexual in the fic and that I didn't actually ship them together.

My friends then accused me of being ""delusional and parasocial"" because I was writing a ""ship fic"" between two irl celebrities, before telling me what I was doing was creepy and in their words, ""Sasaeng behaviour"". I argued back and said that there was no smut and the romance was going to be very light, before emphasising that I didn't actually ship them and was just writing out of fun. I also told them that it was the same kind of thing with fanmade edits and compilations that were intended to be a joke. But my friends are still not accepting my explanation and calling me a creep and now I'm wondering whether what I did was genuinely out of line/creepy behaviour.

58,1gfin4o,AITA for crying in a family gathering? ,"My(48F) son (26M), ''James'' very recently got married to his wife (24F), ''Lily''. For some backstory, my husband passed away in a tragic car accident when my son was around a year old. It was devastating, and in some ways, I still haven't moved on. It's been just me and James for so long, and I'm really happy he's found someone who loves him. Now, he was living with me during that time, so Lily moved in with us. They discussed it before and were okay with that.

We had a family gathering at our house, where we basically have lunch and play some games, stuff like that. It was suggested by one of my husband's cousins who lives nearby, ""Tom"", and we all liked the idea, but the date he suggested was our anniversary, and we'd complete 30 years of marriage if my husband was around. I wanted the day to myself, and asked him if we could do it some other day, but he said it's the only weekend everyone is free, because they all have work or studies lined up for the others. I tried reiterating that it wasn't a good time, but they decided to have it then anyways. So most of the relatives who live nearby, my daughter with her husband and kids come over. I really didn't want to deal with people at all, but I was trying to keep it together.

While we were having lunch, Tom and his wife announce that their daughter (20) is dropping out of college and starting a business, and they wanted to celebrate her taking this new step in life. Everybody was happy for her and started discussing about her plans. I know I was supposed to be happy for her, but I was having a hard time being happy about anything. After a while, while playing a board game, they say that she needs capital, and they don't have enough. They suggested my son ''loaning'' them the money his father left him. Tom and family are known to never pay people back, so of course my son refused. Tom was upset and said that it was ''his fair share anyways'', which my husband should have given him. My son never got along well with him or his family, so he refused and said it's his, and he's not interested in supporting his daughter's business. After some back and forth, Tom's wife continued about how we should be more supportive of her as it's hard enough to start a business as a woman. My son refused, and Tom said to me ''Good job on raising a misogynist''. I was silent. At some point they dropped it and focused on the game, but they kept throwing stray remarks at my husband for leaving him nothing in his will. They weren't upfront enough to catch attention, but I couldn't take it, and I asked them to stop. They didn't. I had enough, and badly needed an outlet. I ended up crying.

I felt like talking to him was a chore. I lost the joy and the happiness instead I started getting irritated easily and turned off quickly. I kept on trying to walk past it and I'm still trying.

When I was going to tell my friend she told me she had something to tell me so I let her go first she said the same thing had been happening to her and she went to describe the guy that when I realized she was talking about the same guy. So I didn't tell her what I thought then I tried to see if it was true but I would still find him staring at me. One day at the end of class he approached me said hello and we talked a bit a couple of days later he texted me about something from our lecture I responded and he thanked me but I didn’t respond again. I told my friend and she told me she wanted to talk to him but did not know how so I told her I would try to set them up I texted him and from there we became friends then I asked him to meet up with us I tried to set them up but it didn't work. My friend moved on but in the meantime, me and him got closer and closer. I told him I had a boyfriend and I could see he was taking it in but we kept on talking. As days went on we got closer and closer and I could still feel his eyes but as time went on it cooled down so I told myself we were just friends. But at some point I found myself waiting on his texts and staying up late to talk to him, I found myself giggling at his texts. I decided to distance myself as it was the wrong thing to do. When I was doing that I found myself sad and irritated. People started asking if we were together, which made me realize it was wrong to be friends especially when there was a weird energy. I don't know what to do I don't know if I like him or if I just like the attention. I don't know if he is playing a game or if he just sees me as a friend or if he actually feels something for me. At times the things he does and says make me think he likes me but then he would talk to me about other girls and I become the close friend he talks to. On the other hand, I know it's so wrong to be talking to him because I have aboyfriend, but I know things were going downhill for me even before he came into the picture.

At first, everything was perfect never loved anyone like him, and never have I felt the feeling I felt with him. But midway we had to do a long distance because we both went to different universities. We would call each other and it went well at first but mid-way I started feeling myself fade. I felt like talking to him was a chore. I lost the joy and the happiness instead I started getting irritated easily and turned off quickly. I kept on trying to walk past it and I'm still trying.

60,1gfhbjo,AITA For calling my dad a pussy during my mums 50th birthday holiday ,"
Context; 
Me and my brother do not get on in general. We are very different he lives at home, doesn’t help my parents around the house, doesn’t take an interest in their lives, or pay towards bills. 
My dad is autistic and doesn’t ever discipline my brother. My mum tries her hardest but is also very very caring as a person and babies him. 
I personally find it very hard to stand by and watch how he treats my parents, especially my mum. Over the past few years, I have dealt with this by moving out and removing myself from this situation. 

Present: 
We went on holiday for my parents birthday. I spent weeks planning the holiday itinerary trying to find things that all my family would enjoy, a mix of beach, shopping and site seeing. I assumed me and my brother would put our differences aside and for the most part it has been civil. However, he has been making unnecessary digs at me all holiday to the point that I’ve been second guessing anything I say as if I am being bullied. Sometimes my mum will stick up for me, other times she doesn’t noticed. My dad never says anything and I can’t stress this enough, he NEVER says anything.

During dinner my brother and dad put on a football match on a phone. I felt this was inappropriate as it’s very antisocial but equally, me and my mum are not football fans so couldn’t engage in this but I tried. I asked if we were losing or winning and we were losing. The only other thing I know about the team is that they were relegated from the premier league about 10 years ago and eventually now in the third division. I then asked my brother if he was sad that our team was in such a low league now and he responded saying “what do you know about football” and then started asking me to name more than 5 teams in the league etc. essentially belittling me for trying to get involved some way. 

After so many digs all holiday I responded with “do you talk to your gf like this” (who also knows nothing about football) and this quickly escalated into an argument. I proceeded to have a go at my dad too, saying that if he actually parented his child then maybe I wouldn’t always feel so desperate to defend myself and that the only reason he doesn’t is because he’s a pussy. 

We still have one day of the holiday left and I have no idea how to act or try to diffuse this. 
I feel awful that I have blown up and created tension ruining one of the night of my mums 60th celebration. ",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA For calling my dad a pussy during my mums 50th birthday holiday

61,1gfh6nj,AITA for expecting my 29F girlfriend to help with building our house? (27M),"My girlfriend (29F) and I (27M) are building a new house on a plot we purchased. We decided to do it ourselves with help from family members experienced in construction. I’ve invested the most time and money, including 10% in deposit, while she hasn’t contributed financially yet. However, we will both be paying off the loan 50/50.

I didn’t expect her to work on the construction site since she’s not handy. Instead, I asked her to handle cooking and occasionally help out. It’s her house as well, and family support has saved us a lot money.

Unfortunately, she seems unwilling and ungrateful. She rarely helps beyond her duties—when I ask her to assist with tasks like cleaning up the yard, she gets stressed and limits her help to an hour or two a month, while I work on the house almost every day. Once, I asked her to pick up lunch for my dad while helping, and she couldn’t even manage the extra 10-minute trip, although he is working for free. 

She blames me for her unwillingness, claiming I set unrealistic expectations and referencing past issues. She says she never realized it would be this hard before committing, but she contributes very little, leaving me to work 50-60 hours a week.

I understand she has ADHD, a full-time job, and an upcoming exam, and I’m considerate of that. However, I’m feeling overwhelmed and undervalued. I’m afraid to ask her for help to avoid arguments, often giving in to keep the peace.

63,1gfgoud,AITA for telling a guy that likes me that he’s insecure?,"So, I (f21) started talking to this guy last January. Despite him being a bit younger, things were going well… until they weren’t. Turns out, his friends at work had been talking all kinds of trash about me, making it awkward to even show up there. And he? Just let it slide, never once standing up for me. Strike one.

Then there’s the fact that he wasn’t exactly honest with me. He’d told me he was single while he was off in another city for college, only for me to find out later that he was actually seeing someone else. So, I cut things off, deciding I was better off without the drama.

But then, out of nowhere, he reaches out with a casual “hey,” acting like all of that never happened. He even says, “Damn, but I’m actually here now.” I was like, Cut to the chase already. So I told him straight up: the reason I don’t feel comfortable at work is because of him and his friends, who’ve been throwing shade based on all these lies he’d been feeding me.

I also told him he’s insecure and that it wasn’t a good look—especially when I tried to be nice before and tell him he deserved someone who actually liked him for him. His response? “Actually, I don’t.” Like, what? The insecurity was real, and it was definitely not something I wanted to deal with.

I ended the chat by saying I wasn’t interested in meeting up, wished him luck, and figured that was that. He tried to keep the door open, saying I could message him “if I ever wanted to talk,” but I made it pretty clear I was done.

Now I’m here wondering if I was too harsh. Part of me feels a little guilty for hitting him with so much honesty, but at the same time, I don’t feel like he deserved a sugarcoated response.

I’m still in college but have a part time job to pay for all of my expenses. He is done with college and has a full time job. 

We looked at buying a house 2 months ago and my father threw a fit over it. He wants me to live at home till I’m done with college but I still have 6 years left and I’m not living here for 6 more years. He also expects us to wait 6 years to get married also. My fiancé and I have agreed to just rent and found a place to stay. We have enough money for everything and ready to take this step together. 

I’m just worried about telling my father that I’m moving out because I don’t like to upset him. I think he would be more okay with it now because I wouldn’t have my name on a mortgage or deed. I just feel like if he gave my fiancé the okay to propose to me he should be calm about everything. I just don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or how to bring this matter up. I’m also the only child and very, very close with my parents but they don’t really help me financially anymore except for car insurance and phone bill which I can cover if need be.

We’ve been together 8 years. For the first 4?ish years, he wouldn’t *go* when I was around. Obviously the longer we spent together made that an impossible/silly expectation.

We bought a 1 bath house 4 years ago and…. Let’s just say the fan doesn’t work too well. 

So, I bought Poo-pouri as a thoughtful gesture, imagining that he was aware/embarrassed by the stench of his morning routine…

Well. Turns out he is not. Idk if it’s a boy thing or a biological thing, but the scent does not impact him. 

Meanwhile, I catch myself dry-heaving after just walking past the bathroom while he is in it. It is that bad.

So, I started suggesting he make use of the poo-pouri I bought. At first he laughed and seemed embarrassed, and would often run and shut the door if I mentioned the smell. This lasted for about 1-2 years.

But recently, his morning routine has turned into a fight. It’s like a race to the bathroom in the morning, just so I can pee and brush my teeth in peace without vomiting…

And now when I ask him to use Poo-pouri, he says that I am nagging him and annoying him.

Meanwhile I feel that it is so easy to spray a little toilet perfume and maybe flush twice…

I just want to be able to breathe in my own house without gagging. Is it a lack of respect for me? Or does he just honestly not know how bad it is?

Over the years Jada has cheated, consistently lead guys on, treated her friends as if they were below her, and other things along the lines of making poor decisions without learning from her mistakes. 

Jada got out of long term relationship toxic relationships. She told us she cared about him but wasn’t happy. Towards the end of the relationship she started to talk to other guys. She said it was just platonic but we told her it wasn’t okay and that she needed to end things with her boyfriend.
She took a trip w/ her college to another country. We told Jada she should end things w/ her bf before but she disagreed. She didn’t talk to her bf very frequently when she was gone either. She met a guy there let’s call him Troy. Jada and Troy grew pretty close. She would tell us she felt some type of way about him and we told her to not do anything stupid. They end up hooking up. She even asked us “so should i not hook up w/ Troy again”. We told her she needs to call her bf, say what happened, and break up w/ him. A few days later they broke up and have been no contact(he did also cheat a while back but two wrongs don’t make a right in this situation). She was affected by the break up and hasn’t let herself heal. She was still talking to Troy pretty consistently after getting home. As well as other guys but Troy was falling for her HARD. We would tell her that she isn’t fully healed enough to start a new relationship now. She went to go visit Troy. He even paid for her plane ticket. When she got back he asked what they were and she couldn’t give him a solid answer. After this we were fed up with all of these actions and told Jada how we felt. 

The conversation started pretty civil. But quickly flipped to us arguing w/ her. Specifically about how we weren’t listening to her/how we can’t tell her what to do.  Personal things were brought up in the argument too. Like her choosing guys over us. We all live in different states so we have to put in an effort to see each other. But she would put more effort into seeing guys than seeing us. We brought up how she would put us down to make herself seem better. And how we felt hurt by that. Things ended in nothing being resolved and we didn’t talk for a week. She texted us saying she understands we want to help her but we should apologize to her for being harsh and unsympathetic. Elsa apologized to her for the approach and a few other things. I did not. I felt as if i wasn’t the one in the wrong and I shouldn’t have to apologize for trying to help. The point of the conversation was to say her behavior isn’t healthy, she’s going to look back at this time and regret it, and how her actions hurt us. It’s been at least a month or more and we haven’t talked to Jada since. I would also like to add that some of the things i said in the argument were out of pocket but they were things I needed to get off my chest. AITA for not apologizing to her?

But she would put more effort into seeing guys than seeing us. We brought up how she would put us down to make herself seem better. And how we felt hurt by that. Things ended in nothing being resolved and we didn’t talk for a week. She texted us saying she understands we want to help her but we should apologize to her for being harsh and unsympathetic. Elsa apologized to her for the approach and a few other things. I did not. I felt as if i wasn’t the one in the wrong and I shouldn’t have to apologize for trying to help. The point of the conversation was to say her behavior isn’t healthy, she’s going to look back at this time and regret it, and how her actions hurt us. It’s been at least a month or more and we haven’t talked to Jada since. I would also like to add that some of the things i said in the argument were out of pocket but they were things I needed to get off my chest. AITA for not apologizing to her?

70,1gffyul,AITA For not Buying that My Narcissistic Stalker’s 50+ threads of trying to flirt were “jokes”? ,"I’ve been getting stalked & harassed since 2019 by an angry forever alone. I’m married, I love my husband, he & I want nothing to do with the stalker. 

This Stalker must have spent a year & a half after I told him I wasn’t interested & blocked him making new accounts, sending unwanted “lonely” DMs & telling me he refuses to believe I’m not interested in him. I called the police who told me to take the account down at which point he got a hold of my number. I changed it & he did the same thing over half a dozen times. One time my dad was visiting & we walked up the front steps & Stalker was standing on the landing looking at my front door. We called the police, building security filed a report & I moved. 

All I’ve ever said to this idiot is “no”, “not interested”, “stop”, “you’re creepy” & “go away”. 

I was repeatedly EXTREMELY polite initially about not wanting the stalker to flirt with me. He used to come on & just OBSESS because I wouldn’t share a ton beyond the fact I was seeing someone (who I married within a handful of years). Finally the other day I just politely said “you know, this fixation with your feelings about my husband have to stop, Stalker. This isn’t appropriate, I’m tired of constantly watching what I say so Stalker doesn’t get triggered over my marriage (my FIRST priority) disrupts his fantasy of pretending he didn’t fling a bunch of unreciprocated sexual energy at a married woman (then dating) who is absolutely in love with her partner. 

I wasn’t mean, I wasn’t cruel. I was matter of fact. 

Now the stalker is screeching at me I should take it down. He keeps trying to claim my assuming the unwanted messages, conversation attempts, texts, calls, invasion into my life is the product of some sick attraction Stalker SAID he felt way more than I ever wanted to hear is just as bad as him saying I must have a crush on him because I said “no thanks”.  He keeps claiming his incessant unwanted attempts to reach out to me were “jokes”. I told him right when he started bothering me I didn’t find it funny & he kept flirting anyway. Honestly, NO. I don’t want to take it down, I didn’t say anything wrong or untrue. I don’t buy anybody takes a “joke” this far. 

I think Stalker’s argument is the attempt of a deeply delusional man to intimidate a woman into not telling it as it is. I think Stalker had a fantasy of getting some female attention & I think Stalker is angry me & my husband telling him to stop disrupts that. I’m tired of Stalker responding my trying to convince me my husband doesn’t actually love me & that I’m the delusional party.

73,1gffm44,AITA for isolating myself to cope with a bad mood rather than do something with my wife on the last day before a short trip she isn't coming with me on?,"(Sorry for the really messy train of thought below. My head still isn't clear.)

Had a really shit last 24 hours for reasons beyond my control (having a terrible night despite going to bed early, having a tonne of things to do in the morning while being physically exhausted, the incompetence of multiple companies directly affecting me in negative ways yesterday and today, those companies making it hell to file a complaint, and a lot of traffic and idiot drivers).

My way of coping with bad moods is to isolate myself. I'm an introvert, and being around people (other than my wife and occasionally other close people) makes me uncomfortable at the best of times (not crippling anxiety, just discomfort); when I'm in a foul mood, I get snappy and irritable and I try to avoid being around even my wife in order to avoid saying something hurtful unwarrantedly. (I know, it's something I need to work on, and I am. It's a process, and I'm not yet there.) Plus being alone just helps the anger go away faster, I guess.

She did ask what was wrong earlier and offered her support, which helped because I was able to vent some, but ultimately there was nothing either of us could do about any of the things that went wrong yesterday and today and so I was still rather upset.

I have a five-day trip out of town tomorrow, and the wife isn't coming with. Before going to bed (she's a very early bird), she mentioned she found it weird that I'd let my frustration from the horrible day get the better of me; she would have liked to spend some time together after she got off from work, seeing as we won't see each other for the next five days. It isn't a *long* time, but we're very close and we don't usually spend more than a day or two apart every few months, and we both like it that way. We don't spend every waking minute together, of course, but we both think it's just nice to know your significant other is in the same city as you if you need anything.

I reacted defensively to her comment, as though she'd started complaining, which she didn't really; I shouldn't have reacted like that. That said, what I told her stands: my way of coping with being angry is to be alone until the anger has gone away, and she knows this is part of the way I am.

74,1gffhsf,AITA for making my ex-girlfriend leave the house?,"I am M(32), she's F(28). We've been together for almost eight years, and have shared an apartment's rent for almost one and a half. She recently broke up with me because I like going out on the weekends and she doesn't and she's a bit controlling and apprehensive.

This has caused MULTIPLE fights over the years as she feels entitled to get mad at me when I get drunk at a party, or even with my friends at my place. And the same goes for going out to a bar to listen to live bands.

It's been years since she wanted to go out with me, answering every non-dinner invitation to a late-night couple's activity (getting a beer, watching live bands at a bar, going clubbing together) with a cold ""Nah, that's not my deal"".

While trying to accept her for who she is and making an effort not to force her into participating in things she doesn't want to, I've been going out on my own for years, and every time, it's been cause for fighting.

She hated that I went out alone (although there was never cheating or flirting with women, I just like to make friends), and she wasn't willing to ever join me. What was I supposed to do? My friends are ageing a bit fast, and now they usually leave most plans at 11 pm, so going out with them isn't an option.

Since she was always fighting with me and breaking up with me over and over throughout the years, I decided to start lying about where I was or whether I was drunk. She caught me in a lie more than once and said she couldn't trust me anymore, hence her leaving. I'm fighting to keep the appartment because, for one, she's the one who ended the relationship, and she's also much more financially stable than me.

She has a rich dad who's been supporting her 100% financially while telling her to save every penny she makes. This has led to her saving a lot of money for her age. I, on the other hand, have no one to help me out and am still paying my student loans and other debts. I'm broke and have zero savings because of my situation, and she's loaded, has a rich dad, and makes twice as much as me most months.

My reasoning for keeping the house is:

1. She decided to end the relationship
2. She's more than capable of covering moving expenses, as well as 2-month deposits for rent and the expenses for documentation. Both because she has her rich dad and her savings. We're also childless, so no one is losing their childhood home.

There's a lot more context to this, but I'm about to reach the character limit. 



**TL;DR**: She ended the relationship. I'm broke, she's loaded and has a rich dad to help her out, whereas I can't afford to move and give a deposit on a new apartment.

While trying to accept her for who she is and making an effort not to force her into participating in things she doesn't want to, I've been going out on my own for years, and every time, it's been cause for fighting.

She hated that I went out alone (although there was never cheating or flirting with women, I just like to make friends), and she wasn't willing to ever join me. What was I supposed to do? My friends are ageing a bit fast, and now they usually leave most plans at 11 pm, so going out with them isn't an option.

Since she was always fighting with me and breaking up with me over and over throughout the years, I decided to start lying about where I was or whether I was drunk. She caught me in a lie more than once and said she couldn't trust me anymore, hence her leaving. I'm fighting to keep the appartment because, for one, she's the one who ended the relationship, and she's also much more financially stable than me.

She has a rich dad who's been supporting her 100% financially while telling her to save every penny she makes. This has led to her saving a lot of money for her age. I, on the other hand, have no one to help me out and am still paying my student loans and other debts. I'm broke and have zero savings because of my situation, and she's loaded, has a rich dad, and makes twice as much as me most months.

My reasoning for keeping the house is:

1. She decided to end the relationship
2. She's more than capable of covering moving expenses, as well as 2-month deposits for rent and the expenses for documentation. Both because she has her rich dad and her savings. We're also childless, so no one is losing their childhood home.

There's a lot more context to this, but I'm about to reach the character limit. 



**TL;DR**: She ended the relationship. I'm broke, she's loaded and has a rich dad to help her out, whereas I can't afford to move and give a deposit on a new apartment.

EDIT: For everyone saying I’m broke because I spend too much going out/drinking, I should clarify that I only spend about 5-7% of my income on that. The rest goes towards debt.",1.0,0.0817488357424736,0,0
75,1gffcz6,AITA for kicking my parents out for overstepping our boundaries?,"So my parents live with me, my husband and our 4yr old son in our home, and have done so for 2 years now.

Now the entire time they have been here they have constantly been negative, criticizing and complaining; trying to get involved in our finances; judging us for what we buy and for even spending our own money; absolute no respect for our belongings; trying to take over parenting our son; bullying our son by belittling his feelings and mocking/shaming him when he's upset; giving unsolicited advice and when we don't accept it they give the silent treatment; and complaining to people about us behind our back.

We brought all of this up and told them their behavior was not ok.. and to please stop treating us both like children, we're nearly 40; please stop telling us what to do if we want your advice we'll ask; and please don't treat our son that way or undermine our parenting, just because our way of parenting is different to yours doesn't mean it's wrong.

76,1gff38v,AITA for calling out my disabled mother’s brain rot?,"I (m 19) am getting ready to move out of the house and has recently been evaluating how I live and what habits I want to take with me and leave behind. So far, I’ve noticed so much improvement on myself (making yoga a daily thing, limiting screen time and activity making space for hobbies that I’ve neglected)

As I am doing this I’ve started to notice my family members habits and realized that we are stuck in screen hell. I’m going to focus on my mom in this post but both my dad and younger sibling are really bad about this too. 

My mom (f 47) is a stay at home mom mostly due to her disability. She has Multiple Sclerosis, diagnosed before I was born, and has lost a considerable about of balance and mobility. Along with other health factors, this has lead her to be in her power chair for 95% of her day. From when she wakes up to when she goes to bed she is in her chair, she can stand and walk, but has to use either a walker, or her cane and my arm to do so. Even then, standing causes her intense back pain.

She has struggled with mental health problems for her whole life, issues relating to anxiety, depression, a suspected binge eating disorder, and possibly adhd. 

All of these factors has lead to her daily routine looking something like this: wake up, get dressed, crochet (or another intense interest she has like beading) all day while snacking and scrolling through the most brain rotted Facebook reels you’ve ever seen (ghost hunting gone wrong, aita stories that are so fake (lol),etc.), make dinner when she has enough energy, and then bed. She has to have audio every second she’s awake because she said “I’d rather be entertained than be alone with my thoughts.”

It’s been like this since Covid hit, but before I didn’t notice how bad it was because I was similar, just going to school. 

I’m am now so concerned that she is getting to the point where there’s no coming back. I’ve pleaded with her to take screen breaks and practice her physical therapy exercises, get PROFESSIONAL mental health support that is not just “5 signs you have adhd” shorts, anything. But I fear it’s not going to happen. 

I’m scared she won’t change for the better. I want her to be here for as long as possible, and I know that will be especially hard with her disability. So today I confided in my worries with her, but she didn’t seem to care. She cared that I was upset, but I don’t think she fully understood my concerns. Right after the talk she went back to her reels. 

I feel like the asshole cause I’ve dug her deeper into the pit of self hatred and she’s not a good mom, but all I want for her to to take back her life.

78,1gfezor,AITA for not attending my sister’s baby shower after our miscarriage?,"I (29F) and my husband (29M) found out we were pregnant in April, six weeks after my sister announced her pregnancy. We were all thrilled, imagining our kids growing up as best friends. Unfortunately, in June, we had a miscarriage. It was our second miscarriage that year, and it hit us hard. I struggled deeply, even having dark thoughts about ending my life. We tried to cope by booking a trip, listening to podcasts, attending therapy, and joining support groups, which helped somewhat.

After the miscarriage, we became a bit distant from the family because I couldn’t bear to see my sister pregnant. Whenever we went out to dinner, where we usually talked and shared about our lives, we just couldn’t engage in conversations anymore. Most of the time, we went home early because it was too painful to see them. People would ask how her pregnancy was going, and she would share moments about her ultrasounds, check-ups, and milestones. We couldn’t participate in these conversations or even try to be happy for her because it triggered me and made me cry.

Three months later, my sister’s wedding was approaching, followed by her baby shower/gender reveal the next day. We informed them in advance that while we would attend the wedding and celebrate with them, we couldn’t make it to the baby shower. Being around pregnant women is a trigger for me, reminding me of our loss. They seemed to understand but hoped we might change our minds, especially since my husband's family was coming to support us.

We attended the wedding, brought a gift, picked up their wedding cake, and celebrated their special day. However, the next morning, my older sister (not the pregnant one) sent me a long message, essentially saying, “Your sister was there for you during your milestones, why can’t you be there for her now? Focus your energy on her and move on already.” I was devastated, feeling like a bad sister, and cried my eyes out. My husband was furious at the insensitivity and realized this was how the whole family felt.

Now, we are seen as the bad guys for not attending the baby shower. So, AITA for not being there for my sister during her special day?

My purse had broken a couple nights before so I asked one of my roommates if I could borrow one of hers. She said yes and set out all of the ones she had and said I could pick. I picked out one and asked if it was okay that I borrowed that specific one. She said yes and we both went back to getting ready for the night. We go out and all seems fine until a guy that I have been seeing for a while, John (22M), met us out around an hour in. Some information, I’ve known John for a couple years but have only started going on dates with him for about a week. We are all hanging out in a pretty big group until a song comes on that all the girls love. John isn’t dancing and is standing out of the way so naturally I pass the purse off my shoulder and ask if he could hold it for me. He said yes and I double checked that he had it before I went to dance with my girls. A couple minutes later my roommate jabs me in the shoulder and yells “go get my purse from him right the fuck now”. I didn’t question it and went right to go get it. However, as soon as I come back she’s screaming at our friends saying that I’m a “selfish cunt” and a “stupid bitch” for giving her things to a random guy. I told her that if she was going to continue to yell that we needed to go outside because we were in the middle of the bar and we’re going to get kicked out with her acting like that. We leave and she’s still yelling about how awful a person I am until we decide to go our separate ways. I go home with some of our other roommates and she stays out. The next morning I wake up and she texted me demanding for an apology for the disrespect I caused her. I genuinely was just looking out for her things and ensuring it didn’t get damaged or anything while I was dancing. Also, if anyone is owed an apology I believe it’s me for the names she called me. So, Reddit am I the asshole? 
EDIT: adding some information, after my roommate asked for the apology she told me that the purse was $2,000 and that it was a gift from her mom.

Had I known about its importance and how it was a gift I never would have asked for it. I even double checked with her before I took it out of her room and she told me it was fine for me to borrow. Also, while we were out it had none of her belongings in it at the time. No IDs, no money, no lipstick or lipgloss. Only my things were in it when I gave it to John to hold.

For context, I’m in a relationship with my partner for about two years. Before that, I was in a seven year relationship with a guy who emotionally cheated on me for the majority of our time together. 
Right before I got together with my current partner I had moved from a big city to a smaller one and my partner knows that I didn’t have the easiest time adjusting to the environment here. My professional network here is very small on confined to the people I meet at my job—having a network is important for me and the type of work I do. 

Onto the issue. Today I stumbled upon a local article that talked about a person in my industry and I recognized her name from a time when I used to live in the larger city. She does the same type of work I do, but we never met personally, but I know _of_ her as we both used to live in the larger city for a while. So we kinda knew the same people, I remember her name but idk if she knows mine, that type of thing. I remember her distinctly because my ex, the guy I was with for a long time, was “friends” with her. At least that’s what he told me. I found out later that he had secretly met with her, went to dinner with her, was ultra sweet and cute to her. In short, he had a crush on her and was trying to land with her, despite being in a relationship with me at that time. She, however wanted to be friends and always turned him down (I know because I read his texts, arrest me). Eventually, their “friendship” faded and my ex moved onto the next person to (try to) cheat with.

Anyhow, I realized that none of this was really her fault and that she is her own person regardless of what my ex thought of her, and so I decided to reach out. My motive was, we’re in the same small city, have both spent significant years of our career in the larger one, and we do the same type of work. Why not meet up for a coffee. I briefly chatted to my good friend, asking their opinion if that’s weird given the history with my ex, but even my friend assured me that after all it wasn’t mine or the woman’s baggage but my ex’s. 

Later in the day, I told my partner. And I know that he is very sensitive every time I mention my ex so I gave him the caveat of that this might be a sensitive thing before I told him exactly what I wrote up here. And he got so upset! He said it’s weird, and he said that I’m constantly trying to find ways to keep my ex in my life. And then later he said it’s weird that I asked my friend first before I consulted him. He also says that I asked my friend for permission, which is not true. I just wanted an opinion. My partner says that now he can’t say he doesn’t want me to message her because I already did and that I “always do whatever I want no matter how he feels”. He says his opinion doesn’t matter to me and I would’ve ignored it anyways. He is of the opinion that if a person is uncomfortable with their partner meeting someone/hanging out with someone/speaking to someone etc. and they say that, that the respectful thing of the partner is to follow that request and not meet up/hang out/talk. He says if I requested this from him then he would not do it out of respect for me and for not wanting to hurt me. We clearly have a difference in opinion here because I don’t even think there’s anything weird going on. My ex isn’t even in the country anymore and this woman clearly didn’t want anything from him. And even if, what does it have to do with my partner. Ahhhh.

My Mother-in-Law is Living with Us, and It's a Nightmare – Need Advice

 

 

Hey Reddit, I’m in a really tough situation right now and could use some outside perspective. My mother-in-law (MIL) is currently living with my wife and me, and it’s been nothing short of a nightmare. I thought I could handle it as long as I do what I need to do and show utmost respect to her, but it’s becoming unbearable.

 

\### Background

To give you some context, my wife comes from a single-parent family. Her parents divorced while she was away in college, and she sided with her mother, who has her own family issues. My MIL's siblings are - according to her story anyway – dishonest, irresponsible and manipulative, and dumped the responsibility of caring for their mother onto her only, which may have contributed to her perception that everyone else is that way, too. This background adds an extra layer of complexity to our current situation.

 

\### Current Situation

Here are the facts:

\- Overbearing Behavior: My MIL is controlling and emotionally unstable. She often cuts people off mid-sentence and makes petty comments. Her overbearingness is sometimes matched by her occasional displays of insecurity and inferiority complex. It feels like she thinks she owns the house we pay for and has been openly opposed to my wife and my marriage from the start. She has some strangely un-adult-like behaviors and lack of common sense or social graces. For instance, the \*first time\* she met my aunt (my mom's younger sister) she badmouthed my mom and me - my aunt's own sister and nephew - to her.

\- Tension with Family: We hired a nanny to take care of our daughter for 1 year before she could enroll in KinderCare. My parents have generously covered half of our nanny's fee. However, the nanny behaved disrespectfully towards both my wife and MIL. She seemed to think that my wife and MIL had similar economic and educational background as herself and almost acted as if they were her own personal assistants. Sometimes the image of Stephen from Django staring angrily at Django comes to mind (sorry, this is grossly inappropriate). She would engage in quarrels with my MIL and eventually MIL had to spell it out for her “I have money and I have education; you and I are not the same” which the nanny took personally. When the nanny left without notice about 6 months into her service, my mother made a tone-deaf comment praising her, which only enraged my wife and MIL. They then believed my parents encouraged the nanny to leave so they wouldn’t have to pay more.

\- Family Meetings: Things escalated when my MIL demanded a family meeting to discuss the future of our daughter’s care now that the nanny left us stranded. My mother declined, feeling it undermined their authority as elders, having me and my wife in the presence of that ‘summit meeting’. I personally think it was unwise to refuse the suggestion and didn’t think a calm discussion would hurt (assuming it would stay calm, that is). In any case, this refusal was taken as a sign of insincerity and arrogance on my parents' part, and MIL’s daily attitude towards me has become increasingly aggressive.

\- Threats and Violence: My MIL hates pets, and I own two cats that had been with me since the early 2010’s. She’s been mean and threatening towards them, even kicking one of them once. Another time she has jokingly remarked about taking a club to my parents’ house to ""show them what’s what,"" and has mentioned slapping my wife’s father in the past, some time before their divorce, which raises concerns about her impulsive and violent tendencies.

 

\### My Feelings

While my wife is caught in the middle, I can’t help but feel that she finds some comfort and perverted satisfaction in her mother’s presence, almost like a lapdog who found her way home. She used to half jokingly say “mom is visiting me again, so now somebody can protect me from you and your parents’ bullying”. The most my mom did to supposedly bully her is to (1) offer advice on raising our daughter and to be fair she had experience raising 4 kids since she herself was a kid: her young sisters when she was young and myself and my brother decades later, while my MIL had no experience – she dumped my wife on the grandparents during her childhood while she pursued her professional career, and only came back to her life when my wife was a teenager; (2) my mom made a praising remark about the nanny. The nanny sent my mom a message saying she’s sorry for leaving early and expressed how much she genuinely cared for our toddler. My mom then promptly shared a screenshot of the message with us saying “it’s a shame things didn’t work out with her but at least she really cares for your baby”, but to my wife and MIL’s ear it basically sounded like “it’s too bad the nanny disrespected you and your mother and treated you like other nannies but hey at least she apologized to ME!”. The second one is admittedly very egregious, stupid, and again, tone-deaf.

 

This dynamic is incredibly frustrating for me, as it feels like I’m being sidelined in my own home. Additionally, my parents think I’m too good for my wife. This is obviously hurtful to know, but I try not to dwell on it too much because I think it’s natural for any parent to feel that way about their child. However, they’ve never expressed that sentiment directly to her. She just knows they feel that way - or her insecurity led her to form the right conclusion, I don’t know - and it bothers her too. I’ve also noticed that my wife and her MIL feel that my parents do not treat them as real family, which has led to misunderstandings. My mom has made some comments about my wife’s appearance and fashion sense, which my wife finds hurtful. After the nanny debacle and my mom’s emotionally unintelligent input it only reinforced the idea in my wife head that she’s not real family and is even “lower than the help” in some ways.

 

\### My Frustrations

To be honest, I’ve always thought my wife was a bit dull. I must admit that I am not entirely innocent in all of this. Our marriage is, quite frankly, one of laziness on my part. We don’t have any real common interests or hobbies or books we both like, not because we liked different things and they do not align, but because she simply doesn’t have any hobbies, or interests, nor is she well-read. When she complains/claims my parents see her as a nanny or rube, and I often stop short of saying “then stop dressing like one” for fear of that comment being irreversible. In my mind I know frugality is a virtue and a good thing, and that she has it and I don’t, but my vanity would still make me embarrassed when I think of the fact that she doesn’t dress well, doesn’t wear makeup, doesn’t do anything to remove the little whiskers on her upper lip and is the only young woman I know that doesn’t have any type of ear piercing. The main reason I married her was a simple one – she was easy to talk to, nice, and didn’t give me any aggravation. It’s quite sad but I never believed in love and didn’t bother looking for it. Now having this MIL following us around all the time yields a net aggravation on my life which defeats the only purpose of this marriage. And if my motivation in this marriage saddens you, annoys you, makes me seem like a self-centered and irresponsible jerk, it should. And I applaud and appreciate you for your right mindset. Don’t be like me.

Currently, I’m going through my MIL’s third consecutive half-year visit. Despite my efforts to keep the peace, she finds new things to be upset about every day. For example, today, when I was looking at what ingredients we have in the fridge, she complained I was looking at it for too long. It’s my house and my fridge! I explained I was just thinking of what to cook, but she stormed off and refused to acknowledge me for the rest of the day. Didn’t like my tone, or the fact that I dared to talk back, or both, I guess. I think that might be the last straw. In the past, I admit there were plenty of things I could’ve handled better. I could have been more accommodating as a host, but today is different because I didn’t do anything wrong. In fact this whole week I’d been extremely careful not to hurt her fragile sensibilities.

\### My Dilemma

Here’s where my dilemma lies: While I can ask her to leave or tell my wife she’s not welcome, I fear that would lead to my wife divorcing me and trying to take our daughter. I’ve never tried to prevent my wife from seeing her mother; I’ve suggested they visit her in her home or that she can buy a place nearby. But I suspect my wife would rather take our child than allow me to live without her mother’s aggravation.  

 

\### Seeking Advice

Given the escalating situation, I’m seriously considering the possibility of evicting my MIL. If I were to go down that route, what’s the best way to do it? What precautions, including those pertaining to personal safety, should I take? I don’t want things to get messy or dangerous, but should I buy a gun? Additionally, if my wife decides to fight me for custody of our daughter, what type of legal precautions should I take to strengthen my case? Should I record conversations that demonstrate my MIL’s mental instability and how it would create a harmful environment for my child? I’m feeling trapped and frustrated. This situation is creating a lot of tension, and I don’t know how to address it without escalating things further. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your help. I’d be happy to answer any questions or fill in any blanks.

  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I see some comments remarking how I didn't defend or stand up for my wife. I didn't talk about me standing up for my wife from my mother's microaggression because they're not very relevant to this story. My wife felt that she was 'lower than the help' because (1) she assumed my parents encouraged the nanny's disrepect and because (2) my mother (whom my wife already suspected of sabotage), in her infinite inability to read the room, said something positive about the nanny right after she ditched us, and also (3) because of something my dad said:

Right after my mother texted some nice words about that nanny in the family group text, my wife replied complaining about what the nanny did and what her faults were, but did it in a highly sarcastic and passive-aggressive way, while insinuating my mom was behind it all. Sensing that things were getting unfriendly, my dad chimed in basically saying ""I see, in that case it's probably a good thing that she left"" referring to the fact you obviously won't want to eat food prepared by someone who is angry at you or have that person handle kitchen knives, or have access to your house key, or look after the baby! But somehow my wife interpreted that, again, as some sort of defense of the nanny and snapped at my dad, which both angered and confused him because he was trying to diffuse the situation. After that, they didn't talk for weeks while I tried to work things out and talk to everybody and clarify what everyone meant (while the MIL worked against me by feeding my wife more venom). Eventually, after the MIL left, things improved between my wife and my parents, which never would've happened while MIL was here fanning the flames.

Mind you, to this day, my parents never chastised her for her reaction that day. They did let bygones be bygones and never brought it up again.  

  
As for previous microaggressive remarks my mom said in earlier years, I ALWAYS protested them verbally and physically too, by getting up and leaving immediately as soon as she started to do that. I'd even tell my dad about it and they would argue severely afterwards. Of course my wife doesn't know my father defended her because I'd never tell her my mother said those things about her in the first place. But my mom never learned the lesson until my wife flipped out at her; only then did she take it seriously. Some time ago I said to mom ""I told you so"". She didn't respond.

My mom then promptly shared a screenshot of the message with us saying “it’s a shame things didn’t work out with her but at least she really cares for your baby”, but to my wife and MIL’s ear it basically sounded like “it’s too bad the nanny disrespected you and your mother and treated you like other nannies but hey at least she apologized to ME!”. The second one is admittedly very egregious, stupid, and again, tone-deaf.

 

This dynamic is incredibly frustrating for me, as it feels like I’m being sidelined in my own home. Additionally, my parents think I’m too good for my wife. This is obviously hurtful to know, but I try not to dwell on it too much because I think it’s natural for any parent to feel that way about their child. However, they’ve never expressed that sentiment directly to her. She just knows they feel that way - or her insecurity led her to form the right conclusion, I don’t know - and it bothers her too. I’ve also noticed that my wife and her MIL feel that my parents do not treat them as real family, which has led to misunderstandings. My mom has made some comments about my wife’s appearance and fashion sense, which my wife finds hurtful. After the nanny debacle and my mom’s emotionally unintelligent input it only reinforced the idea in my wife head that she’s not real family and is even “lower than the help” in some ways.

 

\### My Frustrations

To be honest, I’ve always thought my wife was a bit dull. I must admit that I am not entirely innocent in all of this. Our marriage is, quite frankly, one of laziness on my part. We don’t have any real common interests or hobbies or books we both like, not because we liked different things and they do not align, but because she simply doesn’t have any hobbies, or interests, nor is she well-read. When she complains/claims my parents see her as a nanny or rube, and I often stop short of saying “then stop dressing like one” for fear of that comment being irreversible. In my mind I know frugality is a virtue and a good thing, and that she has it and I don’t, but my vanity would still make me embarrassed when I think of the fact that she doesn’t dress well, doesn’t wear makeup, doesn’t do anything to remove the little whiskers on her upper lip and is the only young woman I know that doesn’t have any type of ear piercing. The main reason I married her was a simple one – she was easy to talk to, nice, and didn’t give me any aggravation. It’s quite sad but I never believed in love and didn’t bother looking for it. Now having this MIL following us around all the time yields a net aggravation on my life which defeats the only purpose of this marriage. And if my motivation in this marriage saddens you, annoys you, makes me seem like a self-centered and irresponsible jerk, it should. And I applaud and appreciate you for your right mindset. Don’t be like me.

Currently, I’m going through my MIL’s third consecutive half-year visit. Despite my efforts to keep the peace, she finds new things to be upset about every day. For example, today, when I was looking at what ingredients we have in the fridge, she complained I was looking at it for too long. It’s my house and my fridge! I explained I was just thinking of what to cook, but she stormed off and refused to acknowledge me for the rest of the day. Didn’t like my tone, or the fact that I dared to talk back, or both, I guess. I think that might be the last straw. In the past, I admit there were plenty of things I could’ve handled better. I could have been more accommodating as a host, but today is different because I didn’t do anything wrong. In fact this whole week I’d been extremely careful not to hurt her fragile sensibilities.

\### My Dilemma

Here’s where my dilemma lies: While I can ask her to leave or tell my wife she’s not welcome, I fear that would lead to my wife divorcing me and trying to take our daughter. I’ve never tried to prevent my wife from seeing her mother; I’ve suggested they visit her in her home or that she can buy a place nearby. But I suspect my wife would rather take our child than allow me to live without her mother’s aggravation.  

 

\### Seeking Advice

Given the escalating situation, I’m seriously considering the possibility of evicting my MIL. If I were to go down that route, what’s the best way to do it? What precautions, including those pertaining to personal safety, should I take? I don’t want things to get messy or dangerous, but should I buy a gun? Additionally, if my wife decides to fight me for custody of our daughter, what type of legal precautions should I take to strengthen my case? Should I record conversations that demonstrate my MIL’s mental instability and how it would create a harmful environment for my child? I’m feeling trapped and frustrated. This situation is creating a lot of tension, and I don’t know how to address it without escalating things further. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How did you cope? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thanks for your help. I’d be happy to answer any questions or fill in any blanks.

  
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

EDIT: I see some comments remarking how I didn't defend or stand up for my wife. I didn't talk about me standing up for my wife from my mother's microaggression because they're not very relevant to this story. My wife felt that she was 'lower than the help' because (1) she assumed my parents encouraged the nanny's disrepect and because (2) my mother (whom my wife already suspected of sabotage), in her infinite inability to read the room, said something positive about the nanny right after she ditched us, and also (3) because of something my dad said:

Right after my mother texted some nice words about that nanny in the family group text, my wife replied complaining about what the nanny did and what her faults were, but did it in a highly sarcastic and passive-aggressive way, while insinuating my mom was behind it all. Sensing that things were getting unfriendly, my dad chimed in basically saying ""I see, in that case it's probably a good thing that she left"" referring to the fact you obviously won't want to eat food prepared by someone who is angry at you or have that person handle kitchen knives, or have access to your house key, or look after the baby! But somehow my wife interpreted that, again, as some sort of defense of the nanny and snapped at my dad, which both angered and confused him because he was trying to diffuse the situation. After that, they didn't talk for weeks while I tried to work things out and talk to everybody and clarify what everyone meant (while the MIL worked against me by feeding my wife more venom). Eventually, after the MIL left, things improved between my wife and my parents, which never would've happened while MIL was here fanning the flames.

Mind you, to this day, my parents never chastised her for her reaction that day. They did let bygones be bygones and never brought it up again.  

  
As for previous microaggressive remarks my mom said in earlier years, I ALWAYS protested them verbally and physically too, by getting up and leaving immediately as soon as she started to do that. I'd even tell my dad about it and they would argue severely afterwards. Of course my wife doesn't know my father defended her because I'd never tell her my mother said those things about her in the first place. But my mom never learned the lesson until my wife flipped out at her; only then did she take it seriously. Some time ago I said to mom ""I told you so"". She didn't respond.

Last week my best friend 41F-Luna who I 39F work with has a brother 44M working with us. During lunch he left and didn't return. Come to find out he had gotten arrested. The next day she tells me what he was arrested for.

 After lunch one of the other guys we work with calls to ask what happened to her brother. I know I messed up by entertaining the conversation but I said, I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I don't think hes coming back. He took it as he found another job and did a no call no show. So I texted her to let her know the guys were already asking questions and I told her what I said. At the time not thinking it was a bad thing. She got upset that I said something period. I apologized over and over and told her I would talk to her brother and tell him that it was me, that I wanted to make things right. The way she told me about what happened to him was that A, then B and then C happened. About an hour later she texts me saying that all the guys know and that they know everything. A, B and C, that her cousin (who also works with us) is texting her and she sends me the screen shots. I told her I don't know how they found out exactly about A, B and C but it was not me that told them all that, I swear on our friendship. All she said was I trusted you to not say anything. I totally understand, but now she is ignoring me. I told her brother and he said it's ok don't worry about it.

 That happened Friday, Monday I see her at work and waved at her, she just turned around. Today, Tuesday I'm being told by the guys that his mugshot is in the news and they are talking about how did he get caught. I'm thinking to myself, I thought they knew everything? She said they knew everything. Now I'm thinking that because she was so upset that I said something that she just wanted to add more fuel to the fire and say that they knew A, B and C just to make me look even worse. Not including Friday, it's been 4 days that she has been ignoring me and avoiding me at work. 

I've never been in a healthy relationship, but I've been toxic relationships and this is how things were with them. Being completely ignored until they felt like talking to me again.

Yesterday as every day I see the same guy from poland go smoke weed “behind” during the break from my work. Why I know it is weed? Cuz its legal as I know it and I smell it from him slightly when he comes back + his behavior gets chaotic (im thinking there might be extra involved something)…



He is chaotic guy in general. After smoking he came back to our normal smoking area for cigarettes and started shouting “AAAAAAH BRRR ITS COLD”. Because I usually stand alone there and chill on my own, when he passed me he shouted in my face “ITS COLD YEAH” and his friend laughed.

During work he drives forklift. So when he is high… it makes me anxious that he will do something chaotic with it, because he just screams while on it and tries to get everyones attention driving around the warehouse (and he succeeds as a lot find him funny). He is “kind of” safe with the heavy machinery but I dont trust that. He is joking around too much and might lose focus.

Im thinking of reporting him - even if he didnt do much wrong except made the joke on me with this screaming to my face kinda. I dont get in his way much and he is sometimes nice as well. 

Im quitting this workplace soon myself as most managers and team leaders give 0 fucks whats going on there. I even got like the least amount of training there. I also feel uncomfortable as I am the only Lithuanian person around polish and ukrainian. So I cant communicate properly (we are all in the netherlands but i am the one in the whole warehouse out of 10 people who know english… as it is important language in this workplace).

88,1gfc7vc,AITA for having my ex-husband take our daughter to the dr instead of me.,"For back story I'm F (36) my ex-husband is M(32) we've been divorced since 2017. I have full custody and we split time 50/50 every other week. We are both in nee relationship im married to a woman he's been in a long term relationship with a female and mother to his second child

I'm trying to see if I'm the asshole because my wife is pissed at me for having my ex-husband take our daughter (12F) to her yearly Dr. Appointment. It was his week with her he took time off work and took her. My wife believes it was rude and disrespectful of me to have her dad take her when she was having ""female"" problems. She's been have bad cramps. She's doesn't hide this from her dad of she gets them bad at school he will take time off if it's his week and go get her. there is a history of female issues in my family that my ex-husband is well aware of. He's known me and my family for 29 years and seen my sister go through cancer. I also had issue with it while we were married. So this isn't anything unheard of to him. He's involved in her life coach's her track team spends time with her when it's his week, teaches her to cook. Overall he's a good dad. A shit husband to me but a good dad to her. 
I didn't think this was an issue since he's not one of thoes typical ""periods are gross eww"" guys and she's been open with him about her issues and he's sympathetic to it. She knew her dad was taking her and didn't say anything about it. We communicate very well so im fairly certain she would have said something if she was uncomfortable. 
It important to mention in my state full custody doesn't really mean much there are a few things thay are you choice, like the school they go to the religion they practice and a couple other things that I honestly don't remember because they've never been an issue. But one thing is it's against the law to withhold medical or dr type things from the ""non-custodial"" parent. Not that I want to but even if I did it's against family law. 
My ex and I didn't have the best co-parenting relationship at first but we both realized it was doing more damage then anything. We now peacefully co-parent. We are not buddies but we get along enough to both be present. If she has something going on when it's his time or my time we are fine with ""loosing"" time. He's taken her for things when it's my time and I his time. It took us awhile to get here but she is so much happier.
My wife swears it was beyond rude and disrespectful to have her dad take her. I think it's import to mention there is an decent age gap between her and I so im thinking this is a generational gap issue. She grew up where periods were taboo. Everyone knew girls got them but no one talked about it.

90,1gfbxe9,AITA for standing my ground about legally using a handicapped parking spot to vote?,"Quick backstory, I have arthritis in both knees and have been going between the surgeon and my GP at the VA to figure out replacing them. I have a legal and current handicapped parking placard for this.

I pulled into the parking lot of the early voting center in town, and folks were blocking the handicapped parking spot with the line to vote. I pulled up, put my head out the open window, and nicely asked them to move so I could park there. My parking placard was hanging from my rearview mirror.

Folks shuffled there feet and looked like they weren’t going to move when one woman from further back in the line starting yelling for no one to move.

It was a handicapped parking space. Huge symbol painted on the ground. Sign up on the metal post.

I ask again saying it is a legal parking spot and would people please move. I am carefully watching my words at this point.

Again the woman in the back starts yelling I’m wrong and tries to engage me with arguing and when someone went to move she again yelled, for no one to move.

At this point my wife got out of the car to get an election official.

I was pissed and realized this goblin was not going to relent. I explained I was going to call the police for blocking a handicapped parking pot and election interference. She told me I should. She is yelling, cursing and went full ad hominem.

Not going to lie I argued back until I realized her circular logic was making it all about her.

The election worker showed up and had them move the line, explaining they couldn’t block any parking spots. 

Unhappy she had to move and I could park she starts loudly telling the poll worker I was being an insolent asshole. A male voice I hadn’t heard before also screamed I was wrong and made some questionable observations regarding my ancestry.

Having enough I took my shot and condescendingly said, ”Ok sweetie, you should just calm down.” I’m fully aware after decades of marriage this is a move no man should use without a cup, but as fate would have it I was still sitting in my vehicle.

So after I parked and we all headed to the back of the line I picked up one of the four to five chairs along the line for folks who have trouble standing in line.

Immediately, she starts yelling at me that I was not allowed to take the chairs they had put out for other people.

I rolled my eyes in her general direction, walked to the back of the line and sat down in the chair awaiting my turn. She kept clucking for a bit.

Now I’m pissed but I’m also wondering AITA? My wife who is non-confrontational was bothered. My teen was embarrassed her first time voting.

Edit 1: I talked to my kiddo. We talk all the time on topics, I raised her that way and luckily it stuck.  She was embarrassed by the moment but said she would have done the same thing since the woman was pushing hella hard. She understands this is a wilder than normal election seasons. I was relieved to hear she was embarrassed by the moment but not by my actions.

Edit 2: Realized the body of the post was mistakenly in bold. I removed it. I didn't realize I had it on in my notes app when I wrote the rough draft.

Edit 3: Thanks for taking the time to interact. Glad to see I was just overthinking.

Edit 4: I've noticed some assumptions, let me remedy those.  
  
I'm white, Gen-X (in my 50s), I'd estimate she was in her mid-30s.

We don't know for sure, but that was our initial assessments.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for standing my ground about legally using a handicapped parking spot to vote? Quick backstory, I have arthritis in both knees and have been going between the surgeon and my GP at the VA to figure out replacing them. I have a legal and current handicapped parking placard for this.

I pulled into the parking lot of the early voting center in town, and folks were blocking the handicapped parking spot with the line to vote. I pulled up, put my head out the open window, and nicely asked them to move so I could park there. My parking placard was hanging from my rearview mirror.

Folks shuffled there feet and looked like they weren’t going to move when one woman from further back in the line starting yelling for no one to move.

It was a handicapped parking space. Huge symbol painted on the ground. Sign up on the metal post.

I ask again saying it is a legal parking spot and would people please move. I am carefully watching my words at this point.

Again the woman in the back starts yelling I’m wrong and tries to engage me with arguing and when someone went to move she again yelled, for no one to move.

At this point my wife got out of the car to get an election official.

I was pissed and realized this goblin was not going to relent. I explained I was going to call the police for blocking a handicapped parking pot and election interference. She told me I should. She is yelling, cursing and went full ad hominem.

Not going to lie I argued back until I realized her circular logic was making it all about her.

The election worker showed up and had them move the line, explaining they couldn’t block any parking spots. 

Unhappy she had to move and I could park she starts loudly telling the poll worker I was being an insolent asshole. A male voice I hadn’t heard before also screamed I was wrong and made some questionable observations regarding my ancestry.

Having enough I took my shot and condescendingly said, ”Ok sweetie, you should just calm down.” I’m fully aware after decades of marriage this is a move no man should use without a cup, but as fate would have it I was still sitting in my vehicle.

So after I parked and we all headed to the back of the line I picked up one of the four to five chairs along the line for folks who have trouble standing in line.

Immediately, she starts yelling at me that I was not allowed to take the chairs they had put out for other people.

I rolled my eyes in her general direction, walked to the back of the line and sat down in the chair awaiting my turn. She kept clucking for a bit.

Now I’m pissed but I’m also wondering AITA? My wife who is non-confrontational was bothered. My teen was embarrassed her first time voting.

Edit 1: I talked to my kiddo. We talk all the time on topics, I raised her that way and luckily it stuck.  She was embarrassed by the moment but said she would have done the same thing since the woman was pushing hella hard. She understands this is a wilder than normal election seasons. I was relieved to hear she was embarrassed by the moment but not by my actions.

Edit 2: Realized the body of the post was mistakenly in bold. I removed it. I didn't realize I had it on in my notes app when I wrote the rough draft.

Edit 3: Thanks for taking the time to interact. Glad to see I was just overthinking.

92,1gfbibo,AITA for asking my fiancé for money when he wrecked my car?,"My fiancé (22M, now ex-fiancé), Steve (fake name), and I (23F) were driving in my car to a concert. The concert details mentioned valet parking across the street from the venue, so we settled on parking there. 

2 miles from the venue, I noticed on the map that the hotel with the valet service was on the left side of the road and assumed that we needed to be in the furthest left lane of the one-way road that we were driving down. I told Steve that it would be a good idea to go ahead and merge in advance. Steve said not to worry, that he would get into the left lane when he needed to, and stayed in the middle lane.

Once we were half a mile from the venue, I saw a public parking garage on our left. I thought the garage may be a cheaper and easier option, so in a split second decision, I told Steve to go into the garage. Without looking behind him, Steve turned into the left lane, and we were hit by an oncoming car. My car was towed, and we ended up walking the last half mile to the concert. I paid for the 40 minute Uber home.

The car didn’t look good. It was hit in the front left corner and the tire was broken. I’ve accepted that the car is likely totaled. I called Steve the next night. I believe that, since he was driving, he should pay half of my $1,000 deductible. I also asked him to pay 50% of car payments on the used car I end up buying, up to the value of my old car. He refused, saying that he needs to think about what is best for him financially. He said I didn’t care about him because I was trying to put him in a tough spot. He said he can’t and won’t help me pay for another car.

I am a full-time college student graduating this year. I have a part-time job that pays $9/hour and some money saved up for emergencies. Steve just started a full-time job making $17/hour and is living rent-free with a friend. He drives an older car (given to him by his parents) with 150k miles on it because his car gave out recently (that car was a replacement for his previous car, which he also wrecked).

After our conversation, I thought for a while and realized I don’t want to spend my life with someone so selfish. I called him back to break things off. He was staying at his parents’ house for the night since his job site is in the area, and after a few minutes of me telling him that we were over and why I was breaking things off, I heard his dad’s voice on the other end.

His dad tore into me, saying that my insurance payout should be enough to get a replacement car. I said I was asking for help to get a reliable vehicle that was comparable to what I had, and he refused on behalf of his son, saying “that’s life” and that Steve has things of his own that he needs to save for. At the end of the call, he said that if I was serious about asking this from his son, I would be doing him a favor by leaving him. He said I woke up everyone in the house and hung up on me. I spent the rest of the night sobbing. AITA for asking my fiancé for money when he wrecked my car?

93,1gfb89h,AITA for being frustrated my gf volunteered me to help coworker move,"My gf told me that she volunteered me to help someone move this weekend, and i pushed back. Causing her to get upset. 

So my gf told me that she told a coworker that her and I would help her move into her new house. This was not something she consulted and asked me prior if that was okay. This coworker is also someone I have only met twice in a year of dating, along with someone that she has not hung out with outside of work events. 

I was frustrated for a few reasons 

1. I have only met this person twice, so I don’t necessarily think I should be obligated to help them without my consent. 

2. My team’s football game will be happening during this time. I feel like this time is the one time of week I actually have to do what I want and just relax  (we see each other 7 days a week.) so that is a blow to me on top of just being a fan of the team. This is something I have continually tried to communicate to her saying when my team plays each week etc and how important it is to me. 

3.  I honestly just wanted to relax this weekend and not do anything, and asked her to spend the weekend at my place (we almost always spend it at hers) while I did not explicitly say I wanted to relax this weekend (I know I could communicate better) typically when I ask to stay at my place that means we are going to have a relaxed weekend, since my place is further away from activities, etc. 


After pushing back to my gf stating those reasons, I was frustrated that she never asked me first, she went on to tell me I’m a bad person and she already told the coworker that I would help and should just help people move. Which I honestly feel is just not fair towards me at all.

94,1gfb6vw,AITA For Asking my parents to ask me before drinking my Whiskey before I’ve even had any,"I (23m) Live with my parents. I stay in the basement that was converted to an apartment for grandma (since passed) when I was very young. I work full time and buy my own stuff. However, we do share food and I eat with them at dinner. I will occasionally buy myself a bottle of crown royal and will occasionally have a small glass. I don’t drink often but when I do I like to drink crown. The last two bottles I bought were the Vanilla and the peach flavored ones. The Peach one currently only has a shots worth left in it, but the only time I had some of it was a shot I had when I first bought it a month ago. The vanilla is completely gone and I only had one small glass of it. The peach was the small sized bottle and the vanilla was a bigger bottle. I said something to my dad about it and how I was going to stop buy them cus I don’t get much of it and it’s a lot of money for me to spend and not get very much of it. He took it well and said he’d start asking more before taking a shot. He even went out  and replaced the bottle he drank which I greatly appreciated. This was two weeks ago. Since then I had not yet opened that bottle. A few minutes ago I went to fix me some water and when I went into the freezer to get some ice I noticed that the new bottle was opened. I asked my mom first (she was the first one I saw after) if she’d been in it and she said she had a shot yesterday. I followed up and said okay that was fine and explained that I just noticed it when I was in the freezer and was curious as I had not had any of that bottle yet. She then got a bit of an attitude and said “well your dad bought it, but I won’t do it again”. I told her that he bought to replace the bottle they drank and she just repeated “I won’t do it again” in an annoyed tone. 

Am I the asshole for saying anything about it? I didn’t say it in an angry or even annoyed way, I was just curious when i asked her. 


Edit: I should have mentioned that both my parents said they were going to start getting their own whiskey to keep in their freezer to have so they wouldn’t drink up mine. This was after one of the first times I casually brought up them drinking mine. I should also preface I’m not mad about them drinking it. I just did not feel that my mom snapping at me saying “I won’t do it again” was warranted when I asked her if she had been it the newest bottle. 

Edit 2: I am getting questions about how much I pay in rent to my parents. Short answer is I don’t. But we have an agreement that I pay for my car (that I bought and is in my name), my part of our auto insurance, and my part of our phone bill. I know it’s not the same as paying rent, but they have said they don’t want to charge me rent. I do realize I this post makes me sound a little entitled or spoiled. But again, I’m not actually upset about the drinking my whiskey as I am aware it’s only fair as I get to eat food and what not they pay for.

97,1gfa20w,AITA for throwing out my mother's stuff?,"So my mom is a hoarder and I don’t know what to do.I’m going to try and keep this as short and simple as possible.

My parents are divorced so me and my sister live with our mom. Up until 2020 we rented a spacious  3 bedroom apartment but due to financial struggles we had to move into my dad’s apartment. To clarify, my dad owns this apartment but does not reside in it as he lives outside of the country.

This apartment is a quite smaller 2 bedroom apartment. The arrangement we made was that I got the primary bedroom, my sister the second room and my mom sleeps on the couch. My room has two walls covered with closets. I only have the one for my clothes as the others are linen closets and my mom’s closets.

The main problem is that the apartment is too stuffed. Up until recently I had my mom’s stationary bike in my room which I did not like. The entry is stacked with my mom’s  two bookcases which reach the ceiling and look quite bad. There is also a drawers for my mom and an old ikea entryway furniture where we put random stuff. There is a third bookcase in the kitchen as it was the only space available.

After moving back in I wanted to fix my room and make it feel more like my own as a teenager does. But the house also looks bad and whenever I propose things to my mother she quickly turns them down. For example I told her to throw out the stationary bike as we have it in the balcony, looks ugly and she doesn’t even use it. I also suggested she rent a little storage room to store her books so that we open up the space and put nicer furniture ,potentially a closet for her, which she both refused. I am also quite frustrated that she has to go into my room everyday to get her clothes.

I know that it is a difficult situation that she also is affected by but any home improvements she rejects. Whenever I tell her to throw away anything she immediately it turns down because “it was expensive” or “it was a gift” when she hasn’t even used it in the past 10 years.

My dad gave me this old suitcase that I decided to throw out as we don’t need it/don’t have the space to store it but my mom insists on keeping it. I think I’m going to throw it out and initiate a conversation with her as to what to do with all the stuff.

My parents are divorced so me and my sister live with our mom. Up until 2020 we rented a spacious  3 bedroom apartment but due to financial struggles we had to move into my dad’s apartment. To clarify, my dad owns this apartment but does not reside in it as he lives outside of the country.

This apartment is a quite smaller 2 bedroom apartment. The arrangement we made was that I got the primary bedroom, my sister the second room and my mom sleeps on the couch. My room has two walls covered with closets. I only have the one for my clothes as the others are linen closets and my mom’s closets.

99,1gf9qwg,AITA for leaving my stepmum's house early?,"So I (16M) went to my stepmum's (49F) place a bit ago.

Before I start the story, I have ASD (autism spectrum disorder) and I'm also a child of a divorced household and have pretty severe PTSD in relation to arguing in general. Especially involving my Dad (47M).

While I was there, my stepmum had spent all day trying to make her place as comfortable as possible for me, which I really appreciated.

I felt tensions rise between her and my dad during dinner when they had a mild disagreement about a house they planned to buy together.

I had dinner then immediately when we sat down to watch a movie, they began arguing.

I panicked and left the room, calling my friend and speaking to her. I very quickly heard them go from angry speaking to yelling and cussing eachother out.

I asked my friend if she was around to spend the night at my place, to which she said yes.

I went downstairs and interrupted their argument tearfully to say I couldn't be there anymore, that I was overstimulated, panicking and just wanted to be at home.

I told them my friend was going to come over so I wouldn't be alone, and that all I needed was to get a cab back.

Then suddenly they both started begging me to stay. 

Long story short, I left.

My stepmum then didn't speak to me for 3 whole weeks, then when I saw her again this weekend, she read me a letter essentially telling me how selfish I was for this.

She detailed how she felt like her conversations with my dad were being policed based on what I wanted and that everything needed to be about me because I'm autistic.

I understand that sometimes plans have to change around me because of my disorders, but this all felt like a little too much in my opinion.

I'm not sure if I'm not taking into account how she feels, I know that I tend to struggle with empathy so I'm sure I missed a social cue or am just pain misunderstanding what's so hurtful about me expressing a desire to leave in a tense situation?

TL:DR, I left her house because I was uncomfortable with the arguing and she found it rude that I left

100,1gf9nt9,AITA for telling my girlfriend's sister to stay out of our relationship,"This is an ongoing situation, but her sister only got involved last night and I'm mainly asking about my conflict with her. I already posted about everything going on with my girlfriend in another sub and got judgement for that, but I'll give the necessary details for context. 

Basically, I treated my girlfriend kind of poorly throughout our relationship in the sense that I withheld information from her pertaining to our sex life. I originally was attracted to her because of her resemblance to a celebrity, fantasized about that celebrity during sex, and convinced her to change her hair to look more like that celebrity. I recognize it was manipulative and have committed to changing. She is aware now and forgave me, we are not breaking up over it.

However, she told her older sister about it at some point last night, and now she (sister) is not letting it go. She made my girlfriend put me on the phone and was incredibly rude, telling me I'm an awful boyfriend and she's not going to let her sister stay with me, she'll get their parents involved, etc. I hung up on her mid-sentence and my girlfriend apologized, but she messaged me on Facebook this morning saying some more choice words and apparently she's coming up here (her and their family live in Mexico, we are in the States and I am American). I told her she has no business doing that and she needs to stay out of our relationship because my girlfriend is an adult and can make her own choices, but she seems to still view her as a child (gf is 21). I wasn't very respectful to the sister, I'll admit, but she basically gave me no benefit of the doubt and immediately got hateful with me. 

I also just get the impression her family has never approved of our relationship. For one, I am Jewish and my girlfriend started converting back in July. Her family was not happy about this at all as they're Catholics. They say she's making a mistake and that we haven't been together long enough for her to make that kind of decision (together a little under 1 year as of now), but it's not even like I convinced her to do it. She asked to go to services with me and decided to convert on her own. She was agnostic before that.

I personally think that detail is the actual reason her sister is looking for an excuse to break us up, but I can admit the way I handled her attacks may have made me look like an asshole.

Today, he sent me a message asking, “When do you finish studying?” I thought he was checking in on me or maybe about to say something cute, so I replied with, “Why? What do you want from me? 🙄” I meant it as a playful response and was kinda hoping he’d respond with something like, “I missed you.”


The thing is, he knows I joke around a lot, so I didn’t think anything of it. But he didn’t take it that way this time. He got pretty upset and replied with:


	•	“I don’t understand?”
	•	“I just wanted to check up on you, why are you talking like that?”
	•	“Did I say anything wrong for you to act this way?”
	•	“I just said we didn’t talk today.”

I sent him a voice note explaining that I was just trying to be playful, but he still seemed hurt and defensive. Now I’m wondering if I crossed a line. I thought it was a lighthearted response, but his reaction makes me feel like I may have accidentally offended him.

So, AITA for the way I responded, or was he overreacting?",Asshole,2024-10-30,"AITA for jokingly asking “What do you want from me?” when he asked when I’ll finish studying?

108,1gg0z2a,AITA for not giving my email address and contact number to my close friend. ,"Actually, this happened recently. My close friend messaged our group chat saying, ""To those concerned and real friends, can you please give me your email address and contact number?"" To tell you the truth, I did give her my email, but it was my school email because she said it should be the one I use the most. After I told her it was a school email, she responded, ""No, not that.""

So I asked her, ""What do you need it for? That way, I can give you an appropriate email address."" I have four emails, including the school one, but the others are unused due to full storage, and I don’t have money to upgrade. She replied, ""So that I will not disown you (as a friend). Now, give it to me or else.""

I told her again about the issues with my emails, and she said just to use the school email then. But I asked again, ""What are you going to do with our emails and numbers?"" She then bumped her previous message, saying, ""To those concerned and real friends, can you please give me your email address and contact number? So you (name) are not a real friend for not trusting me with your info😀. I don't even know a handsome person here to give your info to.""

Actually, her response, ""So you (name) are not a real friend for not trusting me with your info😀. I don't even know a handsome person here to give your info to,"" triggered me. Though I often ask her if she knows a handsome person, I meant it as a joke to lighten the mood. I mean, who doesn't like to see handsome and beautiful faces? It never crossed my mind to chat with them because, to be honest, I’m the type of person who, if I see a handsome guy, would honestly say he’s handsome (not to him, but to my friends) and then forget their faces. It was never that serious. There were times when she would say, ""You're all about handsome guys.""

I just couldn't accept that she thought of me that way when I thought very highly of her. Regarding the email address and contact number, I believe it's my right to know why she's asking for it as the owner.

109,1gg0rkc,WIBTA For telling my mother that we cannot afford to have another child in our home?,"Throwaway because I dont want this tied to me.

Hi im a 14F kid with an 18M half brother. We live with our mother 36F who is currently pregnant with another child. Our fathers both suck and aren't all that present in our lives. Me and my brother are both severely autistic as well but are on opposite ends of the spectrum.

For some context my mother purposely decided to have a kid that looks like her long term ex boyfriend after a chemical pregnancy she had with him. They broke up not too long ago and still talk a lot. I actually don't know if they are together anymore, its that bad. She had a kid with this guy who I said was definitely in some shady business and my mother ignored that bit what do you know I was correct. So we have to worry about the baby daddy now even though I told her not to tell him in the first place. Shes going to finally take my advice and lie to him saying that she miscarried but he follows her on facebook. More issues to be had is that my brother has severe anger issues. He has broken several monitors and controllers, which would definitely wake up a newborn baby. He also doesn't want a mixed race child in the family and this baby would be a mixed race child. No he isnt aware of it. I think I should say that my childhood was confusing and still is. All im going to say is, barricading my door to keep her from entering after every argument whilst she jammed her arms and legs through the doorframe was not fun. But she did spoil us rotten on birthdays nad Christmas and played dolls with me so... but she did destroy  the one sentimental dollhouse I had because I was going through a mental breakdown... Do you see my confusion?

I would love another sibling. I would love to be an older sister. However, we cannot afford another child right now. My mother is wracked with stress trying to parent me and my brother. This kid is guaranteed to be autistic so how on earth will she cope? I understand she has wants another kid but this is absurd. She thought the kid would bring her long term ex boyfriend back. It will not do that. It seems like she has planned for me to do most of the raising especially when the kid is older. After all she is more interested in raising when the kid is younger. Once they reach a certain age they just aint fun anymore. She is hoping for twins. Maybe even triplets. We live in a rented 3 bedroom house. Unless the cupboard under the stairs is turning into a bedroom I dont think we even have the space for another child.

So thats why I just want to talk to her about this.

Thats why I have to ask. Reddit, Will I be the asshole?

About a few months ago it was the birthday of Sophy, usually for birthdays we buy a gift the friend group together, I am usually in charge of buying the present, for this one though I was in holidays to another country, so I told Ann and Marta to take care themselves of the gift, and once I'm back they tell me how much money I ought them.

The thing is that they didn't get her any gifts, and Sophy is still mad about it. I don't know if my friends thought I would take care of the gift once I'm back, or that they believe that some fries is a good gift, anyway I didn't feel like buying her a gift, if they had arranged it I would have paid my part, but I didn't want to organize it, mostly because she isn't really nice to me, she bragged about not contributing to my birthday gift (Which they did give me over a month late), I'm tired of being the one in charge of it, she owes me money, and I don't like her.

The thing is, since then there have been both Ann and Marta's birthday, for the Ann's, me and Marta gifted her a book, I didn't want to ask Sophy if she wanted to participate in the gift, but Marta wanted to do it, so I let her, Sophy obviously didn't want to, we gave the gift in front of Sophy, Ann assumed It was from the three of us, and Sophy didn't correct he, so I told Ann that the gift was only from me and Martha.

115,1gg08k9,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me","I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.  
  
Now the girls want my number. They are sorry I “felt lonely” at Xmas.

They want to come visit and stay with us next year! Conveniently in summer, I live near a beach.  
  
I've told Tim absolutely not about giving out my number. I'm happy to be polite if they come to visit Tim but, we're not going to be friends. If they had talked to me for even 2 seconds they'd have understood. I am not shy about admitting the only thing I have ever contributed to my blessed financial state is “not developing a crippling coke addiction” like my cousin Danny did.

  
Tim thinks I'm being too unforgiving. They would have warmed up to me eventually but knowing how generous I am being with their Father has made them warm up quicker.  
  
I maintain I don't care about now or later, they had their chance to not be catty brats over incorrect assumptions that I was taking advantage of him.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for not being friendly with my partners daughters now that they've ""warmed up"" to me I'm (42) dating Tim (59), a widower. He's in banking, I'm a bartender. I know what it looks like. His 2 daughters thought the same thing, but he's broke as a joke and I've got a trust fund, so actually no.  
  
He's broke because his late wife got cancer. 3 times. He ran up 6 credit cards, 2^(nd) mortgage on the house, cashed out his retirement, everything and anything to get her the treatment she needed and then to get treatment enough to see both daughters married.  
  
His daughters live 6hrs drive away.  
  
We drove to them for Xmas last year and the year before. They ignored me, dragged Tim away when he tried to include me and prevented their husbands from making even small talk with me by talking over me.  
  
Year 1 Tim chastised them, they apologized (to him, not me) They blamed the pain of seeing their Dad with a woman who wasn't their Mum.  
Year 2, they did it again.  
  
This year I told Tim not again.  
He could go, I would never ask him not to see his daughters for Xmas but I'll stay here.  
  
Tim didn't love the idea because me going with him means we can share the responsibility of driving when his back starts to bother him. (He hates to fly)  
His 2010 deathtrap is starting to go anyway, so I leased him a comfy luxury ride (my brother has a dealership)  
  
He called the girls, super excited that he'd be able to see them more often without having to worry about his back,, who then blew up and accused him of spending their Mothers money on a “bull\*\*\*\* house and car to impress some bimbo bartender and didn't offer them a dime for their weddings”  
  
In the ensuing argument it came out that they assumed there had been a life insurance policy, nor did they have any idea about the credit card debt or the 2^(nd) mortgage that the house was underwater on or that Tim was looking at foreclosure and bankruptcy until he moved in with me.  
  
They did not realize it was my house, that he pays no bills save the water bill (man takes excessive showers) and shared groceries.

116,1gg06pj,AITA for not making enough dinner?,"My wife had a nail appointment after work, so I picked up the kids from daycare tonight.

When I got home around 5:30pm, my older daughter had already made herself one box of Mac & Cheese. The plan for dinner was Mac & Cheese and hotdogs anyway, so I cooked a package of hotdogs and waited to see if I needed to cook more Mac & Cheese.

All of us ate, and there was half a hotdog and a couple of bites of Mac & Cheese left when we were done.

Before I could clean up my wife called to say she was on her way home. I told her that we just finished eating, and that the food was gone, and asked what she wanted to eat. She said she would cook something for herself when she got home. I asked if she was sure, and she said yes.

When she got home she was very upset with me because I didn't cook enough for everyone. I offered to cook more Mac & cheese and hotdogs, but she said no, and continued telling me that I was socially inept and that I didn't understand and I should have made more food. AITA?

But I’m completely lost and I want to hear a stranger’s advice. I’m 30F have been with my boyfriend 32M for 8 years now. 
Whenever we fight usually the one to reaching out first. Sometimes he will especially the past year or so. But generally he wouldn’t reach out before I do. Even if it’s been days or more. I thought we were past that but not we had a fight and he’s ignoring me not responding to me calls or messages or anything. I’m the kind of person that wants to fix everything now and fast he pulls away and shuts down. He promised me he would stop. We were supposed to do a middle ground solution but even that didn’t happen. Now we had this big fight and he said awful things first and assumed things and so I said awful thing that I did end up apologizing for when I reach out first over the phone but when I told him I still want an apology from the things he said that started this whole thing to begin with he hung up on me and now hasn’t been replying or answering me for two days. He’s usually sweet and generous and can be very gentle. We’re always talking and being all in love but then he shuts me out like that and it has happened so many times over the years and he knows how upsetting to me and how I used to go crazy about this and assumed the worst. That something happened or just keep calling and unable to live my life normally. Now I’m over that thank goodness but it’s very upsetting still and I did call a few times and message and nothing. Like I don’t exist or matter. Like how can we switch on me like when he usually keeps telling me how much he misses me and loves me and spoil me. But then a fight he doesn’t like (not all) he would just disappear and cut me out like that. And we usually don’t even go back to really solving the issue unless I press on it so many times. I can’t handle this. We’re supposed to get married and I don’t know what to do. How to handle this. I told him even if I was at fault 100% don’t do this. You can take a break with you telling me about it and for how long and then we need to talk it through. No disappear on me and I don’t know if he’s dead or alive. He’s a really good man.

Alright, this has been eating at me, and I need some outside perspective.

My best friend (let’s call her Sarah) has dreamed of being an actress since we were kids. She’s incredibly passionate about it and talks all the time about how she’s going to “make it big.” Here’s the thing, though—Sarah is 28 now, and she hasn’t actually gotten anywhere close to that dream. She’s done a few small gigs here and there, like local theater, but nothing even remotely close to what she’s aiming for. She’s also still working a retail job to pay her bills.

I love her, and I want to see her succeed, but recently, I’ve started to feel like she’s putting herself in a really tough spot. We were chatting the other day, and she was going on about an audition for some indie project that pays very little. I told her, “Sarah, I’m so proud of you for sticking with it, but don’t you think it’s time to have a backup plan? Maybe something stable?”

She got super defensive and said I was being unsupportive and didn’t believe in her. I tried to explain that I just want her to be realistic and financially stable because it hurts to see her struggle so much. She then said I was being negative and basically told me I don’t get it because I’ve always had a stable career path.

Now, some of our friends are split on this. A few think I was out of line, saying that I should just be supportive and let her chase her dream. Others say I was just looking out for her, being the voice of reason. I’m genuinely torn here. I don’t want to be the bad guy, but I feel like at some point, someone has to help her see reality.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for Telling My Best Friend She Needs a Backup Plan?

119,1gfzeb7,AITA for insisting my friend pay the £150 we agreed upon when she sublet my flat? ,"So my (f, 27) friend, Sam (f, 25) sublet my flat for 10 days while I was traveling.    

The situation worked well as Sam was moving back to our city for a job she was about to begin & needed a place asap. I was set to travel for 10 days upon her arrival so I offered her to sublet my flat for £150 which is a great deal in the city I live in. (Usually it's 300 or more for where we live for 10 days.)

The issue is on the last day of the sublet she invited her boyfriend over around 11pm & they had loud sex at 2am for about an hour. My roommate was going to the funeral of a close friend in the morning which he had told Sam about. After hearing them for awhile, my roommate slammed on the door & asked Sam to talk down in the kitchen. Once there, my roommate screamed for her to “get the fuck out” & was livid at her “fuck boy” (her boyfriend). Sam goes upstairs & starts packing with her boyfriend & they call an Uber to go to his flat. My roommate is still yelling once they come downstairs & says that Sam is a “disgrace.”  

I’m abroad and wake up the morning of my flight home to texts from Sam briefly saying what happened. Obviously my immediate concern was for Sam & her boyfriend as it seemed like they were put in a horrible situation by my roommate, and obviously my roommate should've just asked them to stop instead of overreacting & creating this whole mess. We (Sam, myself, and her boyfriend) all talked on the phone while I was at the airport & they explained everything to me. 

Once I was back at my flat, I talked to my roommate for a few hours. I told him his behaviour was inappropriate and he agreed but said he felt very disrespected by Sam as she knew he had a funeral in the morning & was having loud sex for over an hour at 2am. 

Now, Sam believes that she should pay £100 instead of £150 because she was kicked out of the flat at 2am & the Uber to her boyfriends flat was apparently £50. (Side note: there is public transport that would’ve cost much less but taken longer). I believe she should pay the whole £150 as I already gave her a great deal for a 10 day sublet out of respect for her & her housing situation & she was there for the 10 days until that morning.

120,1gfyk87,AITA for refusing to return my ex’s father’s pc that he gifted to me?,"I (19m) recently broke up with my ex (18f). The breakup didn’t go very well and has been a very difficult process for the both of us. Yesterday my ex sent me a text message that said “hey.. i planned on texting you about this when you responded to me, but my dad suggested i do it sooner rather than later. my dad kinda wants his pc back. he wants me to pick it up for him at some point within the next month. lmk when you’re free and i’ll have my mom go get it from you so things are less awkward. /nm /gen”

Her dad gave me the pc as a gift last Christmas and there were no conditions that I would need to give it back once the relationship ended. I responded by standing my ground firmly: “The pc was a gift given to me. There were no conditions that I was borrowing it. I will not give the pc back. I feel it’s an unfair assumption that I would need to give a gift back.”

Later, I got a text from her mom: “Hi (my name). (Her name) mentioned that she told you that her dad wants the PC back and that you responded that you don’t want to return it. That was given to you because you were her partner. I understand that it was a gift, but he built the PC and would like it back. It’s more than just a general gift. I don’t think it’s right for you to keep it. She would prefer not to get her dad involved. Please let me know when would be a good time for me to stop by and pick it up.”

Am I the asshole for thinking that’s not how gifts work and that I should keep the pc? What should I do in this situation?

[EDIT]
Update: I have yet to respond to my ex, but that hasn’t stopped her from messaging me! I’ve listened to a lot of your messages and I think I’ve come to the conclusion that I will not return the pc as it was not conditional and if I give into this, who knows what else they would ask from me? I will likely not be responding to their messages unless the dad gets involved.

Additional information that is important: The dad gave me his lowest quality pc. Although I am still extremely grateful for his generosity in gifting it to me, I need to recognize that he has no real purpose for getting this back. He has multiple multi-thousand dollar pcs at his home and my ex has one of her own at her home. He makes pcs as a hobby. I also would like to recognize how strange it is that my ex’s father still hasn’t contacted me about this.

Why we broke up: Many have asked the conditions of our breakup and how things went and why I did it. I didn’t want to even break up with her at first if I’m being honest. It all started with me asking if she wanted to have a conversation about our relationship since I was feeling some of her behaviors to be unacceptable. She took my initial message of talking about our relationship poorly and assumed I would break up with her. I would try to reassure her but it eventually just cumulated in a lot of things bubbling up. Here’s a message I meant to send to her but never did, but explains a lot of my thinking:

“Sorry I’ve taken so long to respond. I talked through things with my counselor and a few other people too. I care about you and I value you so much as a person. You are an extraordinary person and I valued the time we had together so much. I want to clarify that my mental state was a factor in the breakup but ultimately there were other factors in why I decided to do it. Part of it had to do with how you responded to my initial offer. I never brought up that I wanted to break up with you, in fact I was actively against it. I didn’t want things to end. I wanted to have a conversation about our relationship and how we should move forward with it with my feelings. I feel as though I was making a mature decision in making you aware of these feelings. I was scared to tell you because I felt like you would respond very negatively to it and I knew it would change everything. My feelings were also extremely conflicted and confused so I wanted to make sure I went about things delicately. You told me that if you knew I was unsure about the security of our relationship that you would simply have ended things. I feel like this should be a clear indicator of why I would be scared. I feel like your perspective on that is immature and very black and white. I wanted to be with you. Every relationship will come with its hardships and difficulties, and I feel like this could’ve been handled far better on your end. I don’t blame you for your feelings or how you responded but I feel like you could’ve approached this in a more mature way. You do deserve someone who will give you 100% and I wanted to be that for you but when you come across problems in a relationship I feel like you can’t just run away from them because things feel scary. I also feel like many of your comments were extremely passive aggressive and overly harsh. “I know there are plenty of people out there that would be more than willing to give me that”, the whole paragraph how you think once I get in a “better mental space” I would want you back, “it’s not that serious.” I feel like you use tone tags to weaponize your statements rather than to reassure. One of the factors I did want to talk about was the situation with (two of our old friends) as well as much of the people at our old school you had drama with. I don’t think it was healthy that you made me cut those people out of my life. In fact, I feel like it was extremely awkward, uncomfortable, and reminded me of (ex) who also made me cut people off. I knew (one of our old friends) longer than I knew you and I feel like it’s toxic that you did that. All of those people who I considered friends, you made me cut off and I didn’t even really ever fully understand why besides the fact that you speculated that they may be talking behind your back. Or in the case of (two of our old friends), they did wrong you. I feel as though that entire situation was immature on both ends and I felt forced to be on your side because of the ultimatum you created. This goes back to your black and white perspective which I feel doesn’t mesh with my conflict resolution style of things. I don’t like cutting people off for no real reason and I feel like the reasons for cutting them all off were extremely weak on my end. These were all things I wanted to talk about. I didn’t want to break up over them. I wanted to work things out and become a stronger couple and it feels like you never recognized that. I also feel like you decided to cling onto my comment that I also feel like I’m at fault here too because of my self destructive nature in relationships. The only reason I didn’t elaborate further on that was because you rolled your eyes and laughed at me during the breakup, which I feel is another example of immature behavior. You said that I was going to say “it’s not you, it’s me”, but it never was that. It was both of us.”

Finally, here is my ex’s latest message that I received this morning: “that pc was like at least $1000 and he made the entire thing himself… he gave it to you bc you were dating me and thought it would kind of end up in my possession anyway. i think he thought we were more serious than we actually were. he had it in his head that we were gonna move in with each other within the next few years bc i had it in my head that we were that serious and committed. he wants it back bc i told him how things ended and he’s angry. this isn’t me trying to get it, he’s the one that wants me to get it back… i’m sorry my dad gifted you something that expensive in the first place. i’m trying to convince him that it isn’t that serious bc i know you don’t have the funds to get a new one or pay him back. i think you could’ve been more polite in your reply. i understand being defensive because it was a gift and that’s literally your tv, but there are nicer ways to say “i’m going to keep it” /gen /nm”",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for refusing to return my ex’s father’s pc that he gifted to me?

My feelings were also extremely conflicted and confused so I wanted to make sure I went about things delicately. You told me that if you knew I was unsure about the security of our relationship that you would simply have ended things. I feel like this should be a clear indicator of why I would be scared. I feel like your perspective on that is immature and very black and white. I wanted to be with you. Every relationship will come with its hardships and difficulties, and I feel like this could’ve been handled far better on your end. I don’t blame you for your feelings or how you responded but I feel like you could’ve approached this in a more mature way. You do deserve someone who will give you 100% and I wanted to be that for you but when you come across problems in a relationship I feel like you can’t just run away from them because things feel scary. I also feel like many of your comments were extremely passive aggressive and overly harsh. “I know there are plenty of people out there that would be more than willing to give me that”, the whole paragraph how you think once I get in a “better mental space” I would want you back, “it’s not that serious.” I feel like you use tone tags to weaponize your statements rather than to reassure. One of the factors I did want to talk about was the situation with (two of our old friends) as well as much of the people at our old school you had drama with. I don’t think it was healthy that you made me cut those people out of my life. In fact, I feel like it was extremely awkward, uncomfortable, and reminded me of (ex) who also made me cut people off. I knew (one of our old friends) longer than I knew you and I feel like it’s toxic that you did that. All of those people who I considered friends, you made me cut off and I didn’t even really ever fully understand why besides the fact that you speculated that they may be talking behind your back. Or in the case of (two of our old friends), they did wrong you. I feel as though that entire situation was immature on both ends and I felt forced to be on your side because of the ultimatum you created. This goes back to your black and white perspective which I feel doesn’t mesh with my conflict resolution style of things. I don’t like cutting people off for no real reason and I feel like the reasons for cutting them all off were extremely weak on my end. These were all things I wanted to talk about. I didn’t want to break up over them. I wanted to work things out and become a stronger couple and it feels like you never recognized that. I also feel like you decided to cling onto my comment that I also feel like I’m at fault here too because of my self destructive nature in relationships. The only reason I didn’t elaborate further on that was because you rolled your eyes and laughed at me during the breakup, which I feel is another example of immature behavior. You said that I was going to say “it’s not you, it’s me”, but it never was that. It was both of us.”

Finally, here is my ex’s latest message that I received this morning: “that pc was like at least $1000 and he made the entire thing himself… he gave it to you bc you were dating me and thought it would kind of end up in my possession anyway. i think he thought we were more serious than we actually were. he had it in his head that we were gonna move in with each other within the next few years bc i had it in my head that we were that serious and committed. he wants it back bc i told him how things ended and he’s angry. this isn’t me trying to get it, he’s the one that wants me to get it back… i’m sorry my dad gifted you something that expensive in the first place. i’m trying to convince him that it isn’t that serious bc i know you don’t have the funds to get a new one or pay him back. i think you could’ve been more polite in your reply. i understand being defensive because it was a gift and that’s literally your tv, but there are nicer ways to say “i’m going to keep it” /gen /nm”",0.0,1.0530906915664673,1,0
121,1gfygul,AITAH My Best Friend Decided To Take Her Aunt To A Concert Instead Of Me,"So to give a little background information.

A week before my 21st my best friend (let's name her Sarah) decided to buy 2 Scooter Tickets and because Sarah (21 y/o) had a spare ticket she said she would take me, but wouldn't let me pay for my ticket so I told her to make it for my birthday. So that was fine until...

A week before we were meant to be going Sarah messaged me and I quote ""Hey are you still going next week or are you busy?"" which I responded ""Yes I'm still going"". I was thinking why would I be going somewhere when I already made plans to go to Scooter with her originally for my birthday.

So a day before we were meant to be going to the concert she then messaged me with ""Everyone is wearing Halloween costumes so I'm wearing mine"" But by this time I was working that day and because I work with kids I was going to wear a Halloween costume, but was planning on bringing some nice clothes to change into for this concert and i didnt want to wear the same costume i wore to work to the concert and didnt have another costume to change into for the concert..Then a whole conversation happened...

She then stated ""Ok if your not in the mood it’s fine it’s a Halloween thing it’s on a week day n don’t want u to be tired my auntie was looking to buy a ticket so if u do t want to dress up she was looking to buy one"". So I was thinking WTF to which I responded with ""I was wanting to go but not wanting to dress up if you want to go with your auntie then you can take her"" as it sounded like she wanted to take her auntie just because I wasn't dressing up..

Sarah stated ""i wanted you to dress up with me but at the same time I don't want you to feel ""uncomfortable"" for being the only one who wasn't dressed up"" which I wasn't uncomfortable with and stated that to her beforehand. 

She wanted to arrange a night out at the weekend to make it upto me. But I don't know what to do.

Edit: She also had the full day to get her hair/makeup and stuff done before hand as she didn't have work that day wither as if I did have another costume I would still have my makeup and stuff to do while in work as I work till 4pm (which she already knew) and doors opened at 6pm (it takes about 1 hour to get there)

I was happy bc my fiance doesnt make friends easily and I was happy she had someone close .(as I travel for work semi often and its nice to have someone local in case of emergency and our family lives about an hour away from us) I immediatley welcomed her and since I have a lot of friends in the area we throw parties semi often and would always invite her.

I (mid-40sF) work at a very small business. We have 4 employees including myself, the owners (husband & wife), and their daughter. The daughter (April 30F) has a 9-year-old son and as of right now she leaves early every day and works from home a few hours after her son gets out of school. This came about because she never got her son on the afterschool program list to be enrolled and by that time it was too late. This was the third time (she failed to do so in his previous school years) she missed signing him up because she never made it a priority. And she doesn't want to pay for an after-school sitter to come pick him up and watch him til 5 every day.

I have been at this job just over 12 years and the owners have only owned the business for 3 years. I never call in sick and mostly take planned days off. I will occasionally come in on a Thursday and ask for Friday off and have never had an issue. I get 4 weeks of paid vacation a year and we are allowed to carry over a week. So beginning of this year I had 5 weeks. Another thing to note is if we take off a whole day we have the option to use as much PTO as we want. There were a few days I took a whole day off and only used 4 hours of PTO. So at this time of the year I still have enough PTO to carry over a week and still have 6 days left to use or else I lose those hours. So I want to take the week of Christmas off and that would land when her kid has no school. So she will either have to take off, bring in him, or leave him with a great grandma whose health isn't the best.

The thing is she never plans for anything. April just figures she will figure it out once the time comes around and then complains if she has to stress about where her kid is going to be. Or I will hear from her mom (my other boss) questioning why I am taking off. IMO that isn't my problem. She knows her son's school schedule and she can plan ahead and ask for days off.

I ask if she wants me to buy new ones, and she says yes since i broke them. This response angered me a bit since i really did not think she would expect me to replace them.

1. I always take her on tons of dates that costed me alot of money.
2. She once borrowed my pocket camera for a trip and as she borrowed it to a friend he droped and dinged it making it lose a bunch of resale value as i was going to sell it.
3. She currently owes me 50 bucks.
4. She dinged my car door one day and it is a $300 dollar fix approx, and she said that she wouldn't do anything to fix it.

128,1gfvcnn,WIBTA for continuing my plans to travel after learning about a family member's health situation?,"Hey y'all, I'm in a bit of a moral bind and need help. For context on me, I have a remote job that let me move back where I'm from, which has been nice for a few different reasons, one that it's allowed me to spend time and get closer with my parents who still live there. This job also has allowed me some flexibility to work in other cities (and even countries on occasion with their permission), which I have been trying to take advantage of.

Since I started moving around more, I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life, and as a result, I've been gone often, ensuring I am home for the important moments, holidays and if I'm ever needed. I try to keep up relationships with those at home but my parents are awful at communicating. I call them at least once a week and rarely if ever will hear from them when I am not home. I always keep up the effort, but it almost never is reciprocated even though I know they want me around, with my mom in the past successfully guilting me into staying more.

That brings me to my current situation, I returned home last week after being gone for a while with a plan to be home for 2 weeks. A few days in, my mom tells me that my dad has a health situation which while not life-threatening, could eventually become more serious depending on the outcomes of some treatment which he will be doing for the next few months, and began a couple weeks ago. He is doing fine, is living his normal life, but because of this I spoke with him about it and he was honest, saying that it is a serious situation, but not life or death and one that him and his doctors and trying to prevent from becoming a more serious thing, and that he is very optimistic about it. 

Of course, I knew nothing about this beforehand, and they haven't told anyone else in the family about this, unsure if they will before Thanksgiving. As a result of this, I had already booked my plans to go back to where I was for the next 3 weeks before returning for Thanksgiving. Some of this travel is refundable, some of it isn't, but of course I've been considering cancelling it in light of the news.

My dad pre-empted this question by telling me I should continue to travel and live my life and that nothing would change in the time between now and when I come back, after which I have no plans and can stay as long as I want or am needed. This made me feel more comfortable, and I'm also thinking that if it was truly that serious, they would've let me and my brothers know about it. 

However, part of me is worrying that my dad is downplaying the situation and generally that morally it would be shitty for me to leave and not be there during this time, even if I couldn't do anything and everything is fine with him as of now. Therefore, even though I had been really excited to go back where I was and part of it is not refundable, I'm considering cancelling my plans. 

So what do y'all think, what should I do here? WIBTA for continuing my plans? Let me know.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"WIBTA for continuing my plans to travel after learning about a family member's health situation? Hey y'all, I'm in a bit of a moral bind and need help. For context on me, I have a remote job that let me move back where I'm from, which has been nice for a few different reasons, one that it's allowed me to spend time and get closer with my parents who still live there. This job also has allowed me some flexibility to work in other cities (and even countries on occasion with their permission), which I have been trying to take advantage of.

Since I started moving around more, I've been the happiest I've ever been in my life, and as a result, I've been gone often, ensuring I am home for the important moments, holidays and if I'm ever needed. I try to keep up relationships with those at home but my parents are awful at communicating. I call them at least once a week and rarely if ever will hear from them when I am not home. I always keep up the effort, but it almost never is reciprocated even though I know they want me around, with my mom in the past successfully guilting me into staying more.

That brings me to my current situation, I returned home last week after being gone for a while with a plan to be home for 2 weeks. A few days in, my mom tells me that my dad has a health situation which while not life-threatening, could eventually become more serious depending on the outcomes of some treatment which he will be doing for the next few months, and began a couple weeks ago. He is doing fine, is living his normal life, but because of this I spoke with him about it and he was honest, saying that it is a serious situation, but not life or death and one that him and his doctors and trying to prevent from becoming a more serious thing, and that he is very optimistic about it. 

Of course, I knew nothing about this beforehand, and they haven't told anyone else in the family about this, unsure if they will before Thanksgiving.

Beth(67F) is my most frequent borrower, and pays me back promptly. Mae(63F) is my most frequent rider, and is currently paying me an agreed-upon $50/mo for me to drive her to/from work. 

Beth had been struggling recently and was borrowing more and able to pay me back less frequently, so to help her, I offered to clear the ledger in exchange for her doing a few cleaning tasks around my apartment while I was visiting family. When I left, I forgot to put away an envelope full of small bills that I had been saving for Christmas. Beth asked me twice while I was on the trip to borrow $20 from that envelope, and I said no. I come home after my trip to find, by her own admission, that she had then taken $5 out of the envelope and later replaced it. 

I confronted her about the stealing and the betrayal of trust, revoked apartment access and cut her off from borrowing any more money. She proceeded to call me a teenager with an attitude problem, denied that it was theft since she put it back, and wheedled me about other things like cigarettes and rides until I cut her off completely. 

Mae is aware of this whole thing, she’s seen the texts. Two days ago, she asked if she could borrow money to buy 2 cartons of cigarettes. I told her that in the wake of the Beth Drama, I’m not loaning money to anyone right now. Mae got upset because she had nothing to do with that, and she always pays me back, then tried to negotiate to 1 carton, and then pouted when I declined. This morning, she’s grumpy because she’s run out of coffee, so I pull into a drive thru and buy her a $2 black coffee(with an obscene amount of sugar, the way she likes it), and tell her it’s my treat. She bristles up and insists she’ll pay me back because ’I know how sensitive you are about money right now’. On the ride home this afternoon, I asked my usual question of whether or not she needed to make any stops on the way home, and she launches into a tirade about how she has no money and is gonna have to hit up her son to get some.

130,1gfvapc,AITA for playing the anonymous question game on social media and losing a friend in the process?,"Around 2016-2017, there used to be certain games on social media platforms like Facebook, wherein you could anonymously ask questions to someone.

So, there was this childhood friend of mine (my father's friend's daughter) who got married before turning 22. In urban India the age for marriage for women is around 25-27, so I was quite surprised that she got married so early. For the first few days I thought she was forced into an arranged marriage and also asked her directly why she decided to marry so early. She provided some vague response.

Anyway she got married and I attended her wedding functions. I started seeing her Facebook posts where she would post lovely after-marriage pictures and I for the first time understood that she was actually very happy. I realized that marriage can not have a fixed age and you should go ahead with it whenever you are ready.

One day, she created a link for the game and I very excitedly wrote how happy I was seeing her husband and herself together. I also expressed how I was judgemental earlier and had thought that getting married before turning 25 was a big mistake. Now I have realized differently. 

What I didn't understand was, when you write something your tone is not fathomable. There were some typos as well in the post and my ""happy for you"" got all misconstrued. She as well as her Facebook friends really hated my post and started posting hate comments on it. They even pulled my father's name and I got very upset. I tried explaining myself publicly but she got more offended and unfriended me. People thought I was a judgemental and jealous person. I am a people pleaser and till then never really lost a childhood friend like this. I cried for nights at a stretch but never got the opportunity to say sorry or actually explain myself.

It was all a game of misunderstanding. This will always be one of the biggest regrets of my life. Also I learnt that day that you should read and re-read your messages before hitting send.

131,1gfv0z6,AITA for going off on my future BIL's gf and ridiculing her?,"Warning: Racism.

I made a detailed post on my page, this is a sum up.

I (23F) have been with my fiancé, C(24M) for 8 years and had been childhood best friends. I'm Caucasian and he's African American. We had rough upbringings. His upbringing led him to practically raise his younger brother, E (20M) with me helping along the way.

E wanted to introduce us to his new gf. She's Caucasian, seemed sweet and asked that we get to know each other better. It's been mostly texts, hung out 4-5 times alone and the rest with C and E.

A couple of months ago, she wanted to do the 'Ain't gonna answer' TikTok trend. I lip synced the 1st part but she was saying her lyrics out loud '...and I'll probably answer n-word'. She didn't say the slur but said n-word. I gave her a look because there's no need for that, just shut your mouth like the rest of us. I asked her not to post it on TikTok.

They came to our place two weeks later to pick up the weekly prep meals I make E and she was mumbling the song, still using the n-word thing. I let it go because E heard her. If he's not bothered, who am I to get bothered?

We were helping them move into their new apartment last weekend. I noticed she was trying to joke with C. I went down to the car to get my water bottle and came back to find her laughing, C's jaw was clenched and he was aggressively packing his tool box. E's face was hovering between a smile but not.

I asked what's going on and she turns to me, and says 'I asked C about the trip you guys took to Miami, can you believe this n-word...' (Not the slur, n-word)I immediately cut her off with a stfu, she froze and I asked if she's really going to stand there, looking dumb like she didn't disrespect both men. She realized why I'm mad and tried to play it off, that she didn't actually use the slur. I replied that's a weak excuse because her intent was there. She didn't say it but she might as well have. She tried to defend herself but I asked her if I could start referring to her by the r-word? I told her that I wouldn't be using the slur so it should be fine. She flushed red but C had gathered our stuff and started tugging me to the door. We made it to the car before E caught up to us and told me I had no right to ridicule his gf like that. C just gave him a dark look and told him that I spoke for the both of us. 

His gf blocked me on socials and he hasn't texted, didn't pick up his meal prep for this week. I did text him and said that I understand if he needed time away from me, I can leave the house for a few hours so he can see C, talk and pick up the food but he left me on read.

C is on my side. The only reason he didn't say anything to her was because he's intimidating. He's tall and muscled and that was never in his favor in the past. I, however, have no problem going off in all my 5'0 glory on his behalf and have been compared to a Chihuahua by our friends when I do.

I love E and I don't want to lose that relationship but I also refuse to apologize to his gf.",Not the A-hole,2024-10-30,"AITA for going off on my future BIL's gf and ridiculing her? Warning: Racism.

132,1gfuspo,AITA for breaking my children’s vegan diet imposed on them by my ex?,"Before you all jump down my throat, give me a chance to explain. I was with my ex “Venus” for over 10 years, from when I was 15 until I was almost 26. I am currently 31. Venus was raised a vegan and has never (to my knowledge) eaten meat or any animal product. While we were together, we had 3 boys, M11 “Mercury,” M9 “Jupiter,” and M7 “Mars.”

When I first got into the relationship with Venus, I started to follow the vegan diet because she wanted me to, and I’ve mostly followed it even after we broke up, mainly out of habit. During this time, I had to be very careful with what I ate to ensure I got the proper nutrients, and my food bill every month was sky-high. I also had a lot of issues with depression and anxiety. About 3 months ago, I slowly started to reintroduce meat into my diet, and since then, I’ve felt so much better. I haven’t had to buy loads of vitamins or carefully plan my diet to ensure I got every amino acid or avoided deficiencies, and my food bill dropped.

I also started doing research into kids who are raised vegan and found some things that made me nervous. I read that vegan kids can sometimes be shorter and might need supplements for things like B12, calcium, and iron if they aren’t getting everything they need from their diet. None of my boys have started puberty yet, which might be okay, but since I hit puberty at around 9, it got me worried about Mercury. They’re also all in about the 5th-15th percentile for height and weight, which made me want to check in with the doctor, which also made me very concerned after I learnt that their vegan diet could have impacted this. I was never a short kid, but idk I think I just assumed they were just short for their age.

When I brought my concerns to our GP, he recommended introducing meat and animal products into their diets first to see if it would help with growth before considering other options.

So, following that advice, 6 weeks ago I decided to slowly introduce animal products into their diets whenever they had their time with me, but it has been slow. I don't want to introduce it too fast and I gave them the choice with all the information I had and with what the doctor said. I informed Venus about this and she was furious with me, saying how I’m just doing it to be vindictive to her, when I’m not. And that if I don’t stop she is going to go back to family court and get the Child Arrangements Order changed so she has full custody of the boys and I only get visitation. 

I told her that this was recommended by their GP and she said I had ‘no right in going to the GP without her’, when that is not true, it was during my time with them I am entitled to do whatever I want. 

She’s calling me cruel and she’s been telling our boys that they should refuse to eat any animal products and to say I’m forcing them. When this isn’t true and every time they’ve been over they’ve loved trying new foods like real milk, eggs, etc. some they don’t like which is fair.
