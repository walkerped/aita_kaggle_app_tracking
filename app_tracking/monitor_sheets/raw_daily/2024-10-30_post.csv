0,1gfhjkm,AITA? I've been told I'm mean to my co-workers.,"So, I'm a 20 year old transman and autistic. I'm bad with tones and don't realize my temper when I'm stressed. 

There's this coworker I have and she's an older women but she's nice and tries to help. Recently she's made comments about my body. She said I need to loose weight, that I needed a gym membership, that I looked like a bull (I had a face nose ring in) and asked if I had a boyfriend multiple times. 
She's not very good with English but I understand her well enough. Tonight in the last hour of my six hour shift I said I was tired. She said I can't be tired because she worked longer than me and wasn't tired. 
I snapped. 
I told her I didn't need her opinion and that I was tired and couldn't help it. I was so mad. She said she wasn't going to be nice to me anymore when I'm ""never nice to her"". 
Apparently I have streak of being mean when I'm stressed or when I first come in at work. I didn't know because no one ever tells me when I'm rude so I can apologize and improve. (By mean, they mean I refuse to help, I'm short with answering, snappy, I'm quiet and I don't smile. I also tend to ignore them when I focus because they just end up being white noise) 
I get stressed when I walk in because sometimes nothing will be done. I'll have cups to stock, cookies to bag, extra salad bar containers to make, cakes to put together, sauces to make and stock, chips to get down (I'm too short to reach them otherwise) chips to stock, drinks to stock, orders to take and bag while I have little to no help because most of them refuse to help me unless we're so busy that I'm falling behind on orders. It's hard to help them when I'm falling behind on my own tasks.
