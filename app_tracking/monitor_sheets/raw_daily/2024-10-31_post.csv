0,1gg7uqi,AITA for choosing to no longer wear a bra,"Context, I am a 22 year old genderfluid afab person, living with my parents. I also have a skin condition called HS, or Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa, which I was diagnosed with earlier this year.

This morning I was talking to my parents about something random and my dad noticed one of my HS sores on my shoulder and asked what happened (he often mistakes them for injuries). I explained it was a flare up of my HS triggered from my bra straps and that I get them quite often, they're just normally covered by my shirts, and showed him the identical sores on my other shoulder. 

My mom commented that we'd have to experiment with a different type of fabric for my bras to get rid of the irritation, and I told her I mostly fix the problem by just not wearing bras at all, reserving them for outfits or situations that require them (working out, going to a special event, or wearing a shirt/dress where one would need to wear a bra)

When I said that I got disappointed looks from both parents and my mom said ""well not wearing a bra is not an option"" and I just said ""agree to disagree"" and excused myself because I needed to run an errand. 

Now I'm wondering if I'm an AH for choosing to not wear a bra. I'm one of those people who believes women should not be required to wear bras ever, and that breasts should not be sexualized so much. The social constructs around womens chests are ridiculous. But I also recognize that I have a moderately large chest, and my parents are typically very modest people, so maybe me being braless makes them uncomfortable.

1,1ggmvu9,AITA for demanding my friend pays for the chair she broke?,"I have this friend who is pretty big. Like, 350lbs or maybe a bit more, while everyone else in our circle is more on the slim side. I love her very much and want her to feel at home at my place, so I made sure that my new chairs at the dining table are safe for her to use. But then she didn't really find them comfortable. No armrests that would be tight to fit in or curved seats to press into her legs or anything, it was just that they weren't upholstered enough for her liking or something. So then she saw that nice comfy lounge chair in my living room and dragged it over to the table because she wanted to use it instead. I told her it might not be as sturdy as the chairs but she still wanted to use it. It's a designer Chair, one of those cup-formed ones with thin brass legs, beautiful but not very stable. Got it at a designer outlet for 250$ a few weeks ago. She sat down in it, all good. Then she raised one of her legs to put it on the rim of the Chair and against the table. Ok. Then she decided to fold her other leg below her onto the chair and shifted her weight back and to the left to do this, tilting the chair slightly back while holding on to the table to do this acrobatics. The Chair creaked, and then the leg bent and broke and she crashed to the floor with it.

My friend hurt her elbow and everyone was all over her and making her feel good that night, including me. We got her an ice pack and everything and no blame, she was clearly shocked and shaken so it wasn't the time to talk about the chair… she blamed the chair for not being sturdy right away though and said many times how it sucks to be treated like this by the world.

I didn't say much in that Moment. But the next day I called her to ask about paying for the chair. See, it cost much and I didn't offer it to her, and she broke it? She's is extremly angry now and our group of friends is split: some say that I'm wrong because her weight isn't her fault and she should be able to do what she likes regardless, otherwise it's discrimination and also I should have told her absolutely not to sit on that chair if I wasn't sure it would support her. Some are on my side and say, she shouldn't have dragged a chair over that wasn't intended to be used at the table and if she did, she should have just kept her feet on the floor as that clearly worked better, and that she knows her weight and associated issues best. I agree with the latter, and also want full price from her. I won't be able to replace the chair with the same model (the regular price is just too high and none are left at the outlet), but it was just a few weeks old so I think I deserve the full Price to get something else instead. Also, I'm just 120lbs and like, I love her, but why would I have to buy only chairs that can support thrice my own weight? That's not how it works in my head.

6,1gglg09,AITA for not celebrating Halloween and telling my gf to go out with her friends instead?,"My (23M) GF(24F) of 2 years likes celebrating Halloween. This is gonna be our third one together; the first year I was visiting and she had a Halloween party already planned so I attended without a costume. Last year she went out with her friends while I stayed home. This year she keeps telling me that I ruin holidays for her because I don’t like to celebrate them.

For some backstory, I grew up in a pretty split and abusive household. I’ve never trick or treated or dressed up, and big crowds aren’t really my thing. She’s known this since we’ve been together and I told her I have no problems if she wants to go out, I’d just prefer to stay home. 

Today she came to me saying that I’m “a holiday grinch” because I never want to celebrate anything. This past St. Patrick’s day, we didn’t go to the Boston parade because I didn’t feel like getting stuck on a train with a bunch of drunk beligerante college kids (I told her she was more than welcome to go to the parade, I just didn’t want to.) Now, she didn’t make any Halloween plans and she’s angry at me because I didn’t take the initiate to do anything.

When I lived back in NC before we moved in together, I would do Christmas and Thanksgiving with my friends I had back there, but now that I moved away, I don’t have friends up here to celebrate with, so I’m fine staying home.

This is causing a pretty big rift between us because she’s saying that I don’t care about her to set aside my preferences for her, and I keep telling her that I should be allowed to celebrate or choose not to. AITA?

Edit: For clarification, this is pretty much for Halloween alone, we still celebrate other holidays, my mention of friends back in NC was mentioned because I always had people to go out with that would make plans. I have gone to Halloween parties before with her, I just don’t like being the one to make all the preparations for an event I don’t particularly like. 

I’m getting mixed responses and that makes sense, I didn’t make this post to boost my ego or say I hate my gf. Im thinking of just getting a cheap costume off amazon and having that for every year for the foreseeable future. And to everyone saying I’m boring or hate her, I understand that might be what you’re getting from this post, but relationships have nuance and that’s a pretty big leap to make from me not liking Halloween.

I come from an asian muslim family, in our culture its the norm for kids to stay living with their parents even after marriage. Im currently unemployed and my sister and her husband run their own small f&b business. 

My sister and her husband, barely clean up after themselves. they use the kitchen to make their food for customers and themselves and dont clean it up. They use a new cup everytime to drink water and dont wash em, sometimes theres even 5 cups just sitting by the water dispenser just from them. Their toddler makes a mess with his toys and leaves things everywhere, and spills his food everywhere and no the parents dont pick up after him, they'd just step over it.

today I finally said something to my sister, to start washing the cups after they use them and not use a new cup every single time they want to drink water because im sick of washing them, and im sick of getting scolded for not washing the dishes (even though I wasnt the one using them). She exploded at me and then told me and my mom not to worry cuz she'll move out soon and then started manic packing all of their things.

I apologized to her after but she wouldnt have it. She said that everyone has been judging her & her husband for so long, but honestly if everyone is complaining that you never clean up after yourself, shouldnt the solution be you start cleaning up after yourself instead of threatening to run away?

I understand that being a mom of 2 very young children is hard.. I help where I can and my mom is very involved in taking care of the children as well. so leaving your's and your husband's finished plates on the dining table to  lock yourself in your room and your husband leaving a mountain of dishes from cooking in the sink from noon to 6pm because he wanted to go jogging at 5pm is..going to bring out some reactions.

my parents dont like to see the mess and they are nearing 60 so I dont want them to be doing chores when they dont have to so I always end up cleaning up the mess. My mom is also still working a 9-5 job and she gets tired from doing all the housework.

my mom scolded me after the fight, cuz thats my only sister and i shouldnt be so petty with her cuz shes working hard to make money and feed her children. and now with the threat of her moving out, my mom will be seperated from her grandchildren and that will break her heart. 

so idk, am I just being too sensitive?...am I being an asshole?

9,1ggk5fa,AITA for asking a couple to take a step to the side because they blocked my view at a concert?,"My gf 5’4 and I 5’6 (both 26 NB) went to a concert last night, had already gotten our view blocked by a group of people taller than us (that thankfully moved), and then got blocked again.

The couple 5’10 in front of me blocks my view for like 2 or 3 songs, and even though I’m trying really hard to let it go and enjoy the concert, I’m not having a good time. So eventually, I gather my nerve to tap the couple on the shoulder and ask them if they could just take a step to the right, because they had more space to the right of them. I talk to the guy, and I start saying the line I rehearsed in my head, which was, “Hi, I don’t mean to be rude or anything, but me and my partner are having a really hard time seeing the stage. Could you two take a step to the right?” I think that wasn’t rude, and it was a good alternative from us moving outright and from being entitled and asking them to find another spot, which would just be rude as hell.

This guy cuts me off before I finish my sentence and motions for me to stand in front of him. He keeps repeating “Stand in front of me. Go. Stand in front of me.” Over and over again, cutting me off every time I tried saying “I don’t feel comfortable doing that.” It just felt super condescending the way he was saying it, and I didn’t feel comfortable going in front of him, and I knew my partner wouldn’t be comfortable with it either. So eventually, he gives up and says “I offered for you to go in front of me and you didn’t want to, so don’t complain.” They go back to looking at the front, and then a moment later he turns around and says, “We’re here dancing and having a good time. So don’t complain.”

I get mad and tell him “We’ve been standing here for over an hour, and you two just went right in front of us. You’re being fucking rude.”

Eventually we just left the concert after that, maybe like 5-10 minutes after that interaction. I really liked that spot because we had a good view of the stage despite being all the way in the back of the venue, and we were under an AC vent so there was no way we’d overheat (my partner is on sertraline and they overheat easily now, I just have always been susceptible to heat) so our positioning was optimal and I really didn’t want to move. I was also feeling thoroughly triggered by his “so don’t complain” comment because that’s been used to invalidate my feelings my whole life, and the one time I gathered my courage to make a (what I think) reasonable request from a stranger, I was met with that interaction. So there was no way I would be able to enjoy the concert because I was starting to cry and freak out, and I didn’t want to ruin anyone else’s enjoyment just because I couldn’t enjoy myself, so we left.

But I don’t know, should I have just kept my mouth shut? Should I have just sucked it up?? Or should I have just moved ??

10,1ggjzgw,WIBTA for telling her to stop being grumpy,"
My wife admits she's grumpy in the mornings especially when she is sick. This week she has a head cold.

This morning I accidentally spilled a bit of cereal and she stepped on it and she got really mad. I told her I'd clean it up. I was on my phone at the time and snickered at something on my phone and my wife kinda went off. She doesn't like me on my phone in the morning because I get easily distracted but she doesn't like me talking to her either, she likes to be left alone to wake up in the mornings. She often gets snappy with me if I bring up something she doesn't care about. This morning she told me to ""Just stop being y-"" trailed off and said ""Just stop!"" And I thought it was a bit of an over reaction. She then tried to tell me why she was annoyed about the cereal again, but I just left the room. I would have swept up the cereal but she hates when I sweep because the dust sets off her allergies (she says I sweep it into the air too much). 

I hate how grumpy she is and I hate that I'm expected to sit and eat in total silence for 20 minutes every weekday morning for her to wake up. I have ADHD so I have really bad rejection sensitivity which makes this seem like a way bigger deal than it is. I hate how impulsive I am and I hate that my chatty self in the morning is so annoying. 

She told me later on over text that she was just grumpy because she's sick and I damn well knew she was gonna bring up what annoyed her so I simply apologized so she'd leave me alone. 

Can anyone tell me what I can do in this situation?

Our friend went through a rough breakup and has dealt with some terrible relationships. Recently, a close friend of my husband’s started pursuing her. They've been seeing each other for a few months now, but this suitor has a bit of a reputation for ""kiss and tell,"" which makes my husband protective of her.

One night, the suitor made a joke in their group chat using a term he had previously used for his ex, which triggered my husband. My husband, not being one to mince words, asked a direct and pretty rude question to our friend. He expressed his suspicions that the suitor shared a term in their groupchat he used to describe his ex, and was worried that others may misunderstand that our friend is cheap or anything that may affect her dignity. This made our friend anxious, as she realized she might just be another topic in “guy talk.” She confronted the suitor and wouldn’t give him a chance to explain, which led to a huge argument.

Now, the suitor is furious, accusing my husband of sabotaging his chances and feeding our friend info to discourage her from dating him. My husband, however, did give her both sides of the story, including the good parts about him, as our friend asked for an honest opinion on the guy.

The suitor, feeling betrayed, told her he’s done and won't pursue her anymore. He implied that if she wanted to keep seeing him, she'd need to cut my husband off.

We started talking after about 2 weeks of him joining our school. he had 3 gfs in one month, including me.After his last break up, i was the one who stood by his side and conforted him. About 2 weeks after that, he fell for me and asked me out. I accepted him bc i also fell for him since the beginning. So in our school, dating is not allowed. He didn't even care about those stuff and showered me with love at the wrong time.we broke uo for the total of 3 times . Fast foward about 2 months, i saw him holding hands with my ex bff. David and her were dating. About a month after that, my school had a field trip. I enjoyed every moment of it while stalking David 😅. And when we were supposed to get back, everyone hopped onto the bus and partied. We were singing and dancing until David sang a song for me...a song about how he didn't deserve me and I would be better off with someone else. After that song, everyone danced for abit and David sent a friend to tell me that he wanted to be my bf again. Even tho i still liked him, i told him it's best if we stay friends but we still acted like couples when there was nothing going on between us. After 2 days went by, my ex bff, David and i had some serious talk. I've come to learn that he still haven't cut contact with my ex bff who we'll call tima. We sorted things out and i was still on good terms with David. 2 months after that happened, HE DATED TIMA AGAIN. And guess what? She was dating 3 guys at the same time. And I told David. He got mad and never got a gf ever again. Fast forward to the present, he and i are still on good terms but he's a totally different person. It's like i don't even know him. He still likes me,i know. But he doesn't show it, we text sometimes. The way he responds to my text is like:
             
Me: hi
Him: hi
Me: i miss u
Him: ok
Me: sends him a cute crush video
Him: ok
Me: no reaction?

19,1gghbqs,AITA for wanting my wife’s friend to leave after she’s overstayed her welcome without contributing?,"So here’s the story. My wife and I are in our early 20s, running a business together and trying to build a stable life. A few months back, we took in my wife’s friend, who got kicked out of her mom’s place. We wanted to help her get back on her feet, but it’s been three months now, and honestly, I’m way past my limit.

I’m running our business, cleaning up the apartment, and even driving her friend to her job at a gas station. She’s not paying rent, not helping with bills, and doesn’t even pitch in for gas when I’m the one driving her around. She makes about $1,000 a month, but instead of trying to save up or contribute, she seems pretty comfortable with the setup, which I never intended to be long-term. Meanwhile, my wife thinks I’m being too harsh and that I need to give her friend more time, but at this point, I don’t even care about that.

It’s not just about her staying with us; we’ve had normal relationship arguments, and my wife shares them with her friend, so it feels like I’m constantly up against both of them. It’s exhausting, especially since I’d always put my wife first, while she seems to be choosing her friend over me. I’m seriously feeling like walking away just to get a break from all the stress they’re putting on me.

To top it off, her mom, who kicked her out, is fine with her again and is even taking her on vacation. It feels like I’m stuck handling her responsibilities while her family has moved on. I want her out, like yesterday. AITA for finally putting my foot down and saying it’s time for her to go?

Edit: The way she got kicked out was because her mom is mentally abusive. I don’t know much about the situation, but if my mom were mentally abusive, I wouldn’t go back to her house, take vacations with her, or go to parties and get drunk with her and family.

She’s supposed to be joining the army, and she was supposed to start basic training about four months ago. Apparently, her recruiter isn’t doing much to help, but despite saying for months that she’s going to basic, I haven’t seen her try to get a new recruiter or look into other options. I don’t know a lot about the process, but I’m not sure how long it usually takes to get things moving.

My wife gave her a timeline to be ready by January, but from what I can see, she’s not going to make it by then. She’s not making enough to get set up on her own. The job she has only covers her groceries, and she isn’t making enough to save for a place, let alone a down payment.

20,1ggh7dj,AITA for telling my MIL to stop comparing me to my husband's ex? ,"My husband Raphael (31M) and I (28F) have been married almost two years. His mother has always been polite but distant. Though lately she's been bringing up his ex-girlfriend, Jo, up in a lot of conversations. For context, Raphael had a five year long relationship with her from when he was 20-25, and it was the only other serious relationship aside from me that he's had. They broke up because she told him that she'd lost feelings for him and it just wasn't the same anymore.

It's been comments like, 'Oh, Jo always used to make the best lasagne', or 'Jo always dressed so well'. I shrugged it off at first because it wasn't frequent and I know that she liked Jo a lot when they were dating. But it's getting worse. Last weekend, she came over after dinner and spent a lot of the time (at least while I was present) talking about how Jo would have done anything that I did differently. I felt uncomfortable & Raph did as well, but when he told her to stop she just kind of brushed him off. 

I talked to him after everything and he agreed that it was weird and disrespectful. I decided to organise to speak to her. We went for coffee and I explained that the comparisons were hurtful and that I'd appreciate it if she could stop mentioning Jo. She was taken aback and told me that I was being overly sensitive and trying to drive a wedge between her and her son. Now I'm wondering if I went to far and should have just left it. AITA?

21,1ggh2yn,AITA for making my wife stop using TikTok 6+ hours each day,"Alright, so here we go. This has been a weird situation, and I’m really looking for honest feedback because I can’t tell if I’m overstepping here.

My (34M) wife (30F) recently got really into TikTok. At first, I thought it was just a fun way for her to unwind after work and watch a few funny videos or learn new recipes. But slowly, it started eating up more and more of her time. Every time I’d pass by, she’d be scrolling, headphones on, totally zoned out. I checked our weekly screen time report on a whim, and it showed she was on TikTok for around six hours daily. I get having hobbies and relaxation time, but this felt...extreme?

It started affecting our lives in small but frustrating ways. She’d forget things, like leaving dinner in the oven a bit too long because she was busy scrolling, or she’d agree to help out with something but get sidetracked. We stopped having little moments of connection because she was preoccupied with her feed.

When I brought it up, I tried to be calm and understanding. I told her that I was worried about how much time TikTok was taking up and how it seemed to be affecting her and us. But she got defensive, saying I was overreacting, that everyone uses social media, and that it wasn’t a big deal.

Eventually, we had a bigger conversation about it, and I told her I think it’s affecting her more than she realizes. I suggested she try limiting her time. She said that was “controlling” and that it felt like I didn’t trust her to manage her own time. I didn’t want to come off as a controlling partner, but I also feel like I can’t just sit back and watch our relationship suffer because of a social media app.

So, I set up a screen time limit on her phone (with her permission, and I’m following the same limits myself!). 

Now, we’re limited to two hours a day on TikTok.

22,1gggzrf,AITA for blowing up her phone after she took my money.,"AITA for blowing up her phone for “scamming” me

Throwaway account, I (19m) am a college student and recently was interested in buying tickets to go watch one of our football games. I was going to buy tickets for me and a friend, my college has its own snapchat stories where you can buy tickets off of people, usually you send the money through venmo, zelle, etc and they email you the tickets. Usually I would take precautionary measures, send half until I get the tickets. 

However, this time I found someone selling the tickets for $30 each which was cheaper than most other people. So, I added her, we’ll call her susie(20f). I asked susie whether she still had the tickets. She said yes, i asked if they were still $30 she said yes, sent me a screenshot of where they were located and it was exactly where i needed them. So i let her know i would need to wait for my friend to send me money so i could buy them. 

Later in the night my buddy sent me his money so i went ahead to buy them, it was late and i just wanted to get it done so i sent her the money and was just waiting to get the email that she sent them. then she says “oh wait i thought you wanted both of them? they’re $60 each not $60 for both” which instantly caught me as strange since i confirmed the price and i feel like i had heard of people doing a similar scam but i just texted back “oh all could you just send it back real quick” she doesn’t respond. 

10 minutes go by, nothing, i text her number, nothing. and then i realize she left me on read on the text, which made me think she had transferred the money and dipped. so i called her and it goes directly to voicemail, text her again and the text doesn’t say delivered which is another sign that your number is blocked. so now im freaking out im a broke ass college student who’s never been scammed. i think i have to call my back get a fraudulent charge. but i decide im not gonna just give up so i call her probably 10 more times on snap. i wont lie a bit much but i thought i could brute force my money back. After that I went ahead and screenshotted her original ticket post and posted them on my story saying to not buy tickets from her. 

Then after an hour of no response, no calls going through, susie texts back. she’s says i’m a weirdo for blowing up her phone and who do i think i am leaving 15 calls and texting her so much and it hasn’t been that long. she said she was just in the gym and was finishing up her set. 

Now susie still hasn’t sent the money back, it’s been 5 hours, and i am actually blocked (text boxes are greyed out). Am i going crazy, i definitely feel embarassed about this but did i go to far?

23,1gggxv5,AITA for not helping my family?,"I (27M) moved out of my parent's house about a year ago because my very religious mother was extremely controlling (my way or the highway type). To give you an idea, she claimed going to mass every Sunday was part of the house rules, and if I didn't like it I could leave.
I used to contribute with groceries and gas money, but that all stopped when I moved out.

Ffw a year, my dad has been unemployed for that amount of time, and the family is struggling financially because he's the bread winner. One of my brothers also got diagnosed with stage 2 cancer (lymphoma), which put an even heavier toll on the finances.
This is when my parents start contacting me to try and get me to move back in with them. Ofc they wanted money, and by living with them I'd be able to not pay rent to a random landlord, but give my parents that money instead.

It sounded like a pretty sensible idea, and they really need that extra help to keep them afloat.
About a month and a half ago I moved in temporarily to their house, as they had to leave town with my brother to go get him immunotherapy.
All was fine and well: I took care of my youngest sibling, bought groceries, paid for gas, even gave my parents some money to help them out with their trip.

Parents came back a month after. All was going well. It got to the point where I was legitimately feeling quite comfortable, and I decided not to go back to my home for some time (not permanently yet).

Well, two days ago I was in my room with my GF (23F). We were both really tired and decided to take a nap together (something we routinely do). My mom knocks at my door to ask me some questions, and I tell her to come in.
The look of surprise/anger in her face when she saw us was really unexpected. She asked whatever she'd come to ask, I answered.
She left, but not before making it clear she'd ""leave the door open"" before storming out of the room.

Yesterday I confronted her and asked that she leave the door the same way she found it. My mother started an argument, saying she'd not leave the door closed while my GF was in my room, that my GF was wrong for being in my bed, and that I was doing something immoral by taking a nap with her in the same bed. She also said I could not take naps with my GF in her house anymore, because those were the rules.

The argument lasted for almost two hours, at which point I decided to just say ""fuck it"", packed my bags and left. I did tell my mom she could forget about the rent money, and she lost it, saying things like ""so you aren't really willing to help, huh?"".

24,1gggrbz,AITA for asking my roommate to not leave stuff in random places all over the house?,"I (24F)live with my best friend(24M). We have lived together since college(almost 7 years now) and get along swimmingly for the most part. I am something of a perfectionist, and have low level OCD. I don’t mind a cluttered house, but I like everything to have its place, and don’t like it when things are randomly changed around. My friend is a mild hoarder and just keeps collecting things. He has been really trying to be better about it over the years and I appreciate the effort a lot. 

Recently, however, he has started leaving a whole bunch of his things in “random” places all over the house, like keeping his vests on a dining room chair, keeping his boots next to the couch instead of in the shoe rack, keeping jewelry on the bookshelf, etc. I was quiet about for a long time, but it has started becoming more and more things, and I recently had enough and confronted him about it. I asked him to not leave his things in random spots around the house, and he said “they aren’t random that’s where they go”. I explained to him that I didn’t think it was ok to just decide something of yours goes somewhere in the shared space, and it was really chafing my OCD.

AITA?",Everyone Sucks,2024-10-31,"AITA for asking my roommate to not leave stuff in random places all over the house? I (24F)live with my best friend(24M). We have lived together since college(almost 7 years now) and get along swimmingly for the most part. I am something of a perfectionist, and have low level OCD. I don’t mind a cluttered house, but I like everything to have its place, and don’t like it when things are randomly changed around. My friend is a mild hoarder and just keeps collecting things. He has been really trying to be better about it over the years and I appreciate the effort a lot. 

Recently, however, he has started leaving a whole bunch of his things in “random” places all over the house, like keeping his vests on a dining room chair, keeping his boots next to the couch instead of in the shoe rack, keeping jewelry on the bookshelf, etc. I was quiet about for a long time, but it has started becoming more and more things, and I recently had enough and confronted him about it. I asked him to not leave his things in random spots around the house, and he said “they aren’t random that’s where they go”. I explained to him that I didn’t think it was ok to just decide something of yours goes somewhere in the shared space, and it was really chafing my OCD.

25,1gggldr,AITA for choosing not to celebrate my birthday?,"Okay, so, let’s start with some background information. I am a man in my thirties and I live with C-PTSD as a result of ongoing trauma in my childhood. I’ve come a long way in therapy and have managed to cobble together some meaningful relationships despite the fact that my disorder is notorious for encouraging social isolation in people who struggle with it. Part of the reason we struggle to be social and maintain relationships is because people with C-PTSD have a very over active inner critic. I have spent most of my life telling myself that I deserved my trauma because I was somehow unloveable, broken, or just wrong in some unknowable way.

Thankfully, I’ve found a patient a kind partner who knows all my secrets and reminds me everyday that my inner critic is wrong. He’s helped me in a lot of ways and my progress would not have come along as far as it has if it weren’t for his support. However, there’s one problem we seem to be stuck on and that’s my birthday.

He grew up celebrating “birthweeks,” and spent days as the centre of attention in his family when it was time to age up another year. I, on the other hand, hate my birthday. I don’t like having attention focussed on me, I don’t like feeling like I’m someone worth celebrating. I know this is a symptom of my C-PTSD but it still feels very real for me.

This discrepancy in our view of birthdays has been a cause for much tension between us. In the month leading up to my birthday he will pester me almost daily wondering what gift I want, what kind of party we should have, who we should invite to celebrate with us. It is very overwhelming and, surprise surprise, it has caused us to fight every year around my birthday, which… does not help me feel any better about that day.

He has been very vocal about the fact that birthdays are for more than just the person aging up and that they’re a special time to celebrate the people you love. It seems to me that he feels entitled to make a big show for my birthday, while I would rather let it slip by without ever addressing it. However, because of my C-PTSD, it’s hard for me to figure out if I truly am in the right for asking to ignore my birthday when he clearly wants to very badly.

To be clear, I celebrate his birthday in big ways because I know that’s what he wants. I’ve rented elaborate houses for our friends to celebrate in, I even proposed to him on his birthday. I do these things because I know it’s what he wants, so I’m not sure why it’s so hard for him to respect my wishes to let my “big day” slide by without a fuss.

Am I asking too much of him to not celebrate my birthday? Should I try to go along with his wishes, or keep expecting him to conform to mine? I honestly don’t know whether I’m trying to protect myself or if I’m just being an asshole, so it’s officially time to outsource this problem.

26,1gggj6b,AITA for singing during the symphony,"Background: the Significant Other, Offspring, Offspring's Friend, and I attended a live symphony playing the entire score of the 1993 film Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Every single note and instrument played live. The movie played on a massive screen above the symphony. This performance was so popular it sold out the entire historic theater in our 100,000 person town. Which is hard to do. Dozens of school children even took buses from neighboring towns, on field trips, on the weekend, to experience this.

There were no live singers. So Danny Elfman, Catherine O'Hara, and entire cast's singing parts are played, in time, with the symphony. The symphony kept in time with the movie through the use of earpiece click tracks. Now, throughout the entire performance, the lyrics to all the songs displayed on the massive movie screen. Open captions. The kind that can't be turned off. So it's not like tech crew accidentally turned closed captions on.

Us four, and a good portion of the people around us, were singing along. Guided by the open caption lyrics on the screen. Not screaming. Not opera. Singing along. Half way through, the guy sitting next to Offspring's Friend leans over and shushes us telling us he didn't come to hear us sing.

I thought we might be in the wrong so I looked through the playbill seeing if any text read that we were discouraged from singing along. Nothing. Just a history of the film, info about the symphony and it's conductor, and a list of upcoming performances. I know that Hamilton and Six discourage this in their playbills.

27,1gggg64,WIBTA for not letting friend resell concert tickets?,"Throwaway for anonymity

So 3 months ago, I (28F) got presale access to a major artist's concert because of my credit card and after confirming with my friends, I booked tickets for our whole group (my girl gang + some of their boyfriends). Because there's 10 of us, I did insist on being paid back immediately and everyone did except for one friend and her boyfriend but in general she tends to do things last minute. She did eventually pay me back a month later after I pestered her about it.

But now she's backing out of going to the concert and wants to resell their tickets at 3x. I've refused to list it at that price and would prefer to instead sell it at face value to my cousins (I couldn't book for them earlier because there was a limit of 10 tickets per user and they asked me after everyone else had already confirmed). She refuses to do so because she says she's already paid for the tickets and so legally they're hers. My POV was that if I'd known she was going to flake, I would've just bought tickets for my cousins. I think it's pretty selfish of her to be making a profit off of something she wouldn't even have if not for me especially when we've complained about not getting to see other artists we care about because of crazy resale prices.

Further context to add is that this is the third event I've booked tickets for her and her boyfriend and they've flaked. I've learnt my lesson and will never again be booking tickets for them in the future but unsure how to resolve the current situation. My other friends disapprove of her scalping but ultimately think we should just let her do what she wants but I'm not convinced.

28,1gggfxx,"AITA For ""hiding"" my child's savings account from my ex and not letting him contribute?","My ex and I divorced 8 years ago. We have a 12 year old son together. We don't discuss finances other than child support. I don't care for any money he may or may not give to our child directly.

Years ago I opened a savings account for my kid. I religiously transfer a set amount + child benefit into it every single month. I also put some ""loose change"" in there whenever I can. My kid knows of this account and gets to decide if any monetary gifts from family and friends are to be spent immediately or added to his growing savings. He doesn't keep tabs on the account, but has a rough idea of how much he ""gets"" every month and how much he's got already.

My son must've told my ex about the account, because my ex approached me about it.  
He asked to see the account- I refused.  
He asked to at least know the exact amount (he has a rough idea)- I refused, I don't see the point.  
He asked to contribute and become a ""co-owner"" (as in- the account is to be ""from mum and dad"")- I asked if he'd like to make a big initial payment- he doesn't, as he doesn't have ""that kind of money to just throw into an account nobody can access for years"" he just wants to join in now and throw in some cash here and there, but the amount that's already in there is to be overlooked. I refused.  
He told me that I can only afford that thanks to his child support contributions- I told him that the child support is his duty and is spent on our son's current needs, not for him to hold it over my head.  
He called me a jerk for not telling him about the account when I first opened it because now he's ""8 years behind"" and won't be able to match it and it will look bad when my kid grows up and only gets my support. I told him that it's up to him whether or not he invests in our child's future, he still has a long time to save something if he so wishes.

He told me I was a jerk for purposefully making him look like a ""bad dad"" for not having thought of something like this.

I don't think it's fair of him to ask to jump in and claim to have contributed to the savings I've worked hard on for years, but now I wonder if I actually acted like an AH for creating a situation in which I look like the ""better"" & ""more caring"" parent? Should I have told him about it when I first opened the account? Should I just let him contribute to keep the peace? The money is going to end up in my son's account anyway, no matter if he receives payments from 2 savings accounts or just one.

EDIT 1: I thought I'd add, since this concern has already been raised a few times in the comments- it's an ISA nobody can withdraw money from until my child's 18th birthday (though I'm not sure he knows that), so I'm not too worried about any potential theft.

We finally met up in September and immediately hit it off. It was like love at first sight for both of us. We also spent the day after the first date together. Two days after we met, Mel’s mom, Lauren (50F) came to visit her in town for what was supposed to be a few weeks but it’s turned out to be over a month. 

Mel is closeted, so while her mom is visiting she doesn’t want to stay away from home to raise any attention. Mel thinks there is nothing she can do about the situation with her mom. She talks about how she is scared of confrontation so she just does what her mom requires to keep the peace. I’ve told Mel that she is an adult and needs to speak up to get her freedom or life will always be like this for her. I also asked Mel if she was willing to speak up and she said no because it will upset Lauren. Mel is also an only child so she doesn’t understand how this situation looks from another POV. 

During the time Mel and I hang out, her mom calls her at least twice most times letting her know it’s late and she needs to come home. To me it’s insane to have that sort of control over someone at that age. I’ve grown up with strict parents but this is next level. 

I have started to love Mel and it’s been difficult to spend so little time together and always have that time restricted. I feel selfish for asking her for more time and awkward having to explain why the situation doesn’t feel right especially on Lauren’s part. 

Mel calls me just about every day to account for the lack of time but this last month has felt exhausting. While I do love Mel, I was willing to let her go if this continues to be an issue especially in our long term relationship.

31,1ggfdmx,AITA for going to work and leaving my kids with their father?,"So, a short note: I can only tell about my side of the story. The father (M30) of my (F31) two kids (M2,5; F1) and I are recently separated but still live together and have had a few difficult years. We bought a house 2,5 years ago when I was first pregnant and him turning to the wrong ""friends"" for the renovating led to him taking cocaine, which he (allegedly) stopped, us having big problems and him still having kind of an alcohol problem and overall bad health. He wasn't really there for the whole first year of the boy and whenever we need him because we are sick for example, he doesn't make it. He is good in handling the boy but has problems with the girl (and crying children!). So just recently I started a very small job again after being home as a parent, and usually my dad watched the girl but today there was no other solution than for my ex to watch both. The little one wasn't that happy and he refused to go an a walk with them or put them in the car (she usually sleeps then) and visit someone or anything. Only thing he does is put TV on. When I was done after 4 hours work, he lost it on me saying I am ruining the children and if I dont want to be a mother anymore I should tell him, I should be ashamed and so on. And that I should stop with the job until both go to kindergarten and take my old fulltime job again (where I would have to work weekends too, where there's no kindergarten...). So AITA for leaving the kids with him and wanting to work?

Edit after reading the first batch of comments: I didn't want to write down everything cause it's gonna be like a whole book but here we go: I only got to know of his drug problem after he stopped taking it (at least he says so). I knew something was wrong but not what exactly. Baby number 2 was an accident despite of taking birth control (seems to be genetic, I was conceived the same way). His alcohol problem consist of him drinking too much when he leaves the house. He never drinks at home. I work in veterinary medicine and I did think a lot about it but cancelling my shift would have been really uncool - and since he is good with the boy, k had hopes it would work out. I am already in the process of finding a solution to not live together anymore also in Cooperation with social services but so far I haven't found the right solution. I still receive money for staying home with baby, I live in Germany. He has a job in an office but keeps calling out I'll and he works with his own company in the cleaning field.

So, a short note: I can only tell about my side of the story. The father (M30) of my (F31) two kids (M2,5; F1) and I are recently separated but still live together and have had a few difficult years. We bought a house 2,5 years ago when I was first pregnant and him turning to the wrong ""friends"" for the renovating led to him taking cocaine, which he (allegedly) stopped, us having big problems and him still having kind of an alcohol problem and overall bad health. He wasn't really there for the whole first year of the boy and whenever we need him because we are sick for example, he doesn't make it. He is good in handling the boy but has problems with the girl (and crying children!). So just recently I started a very small job again after being home as a parent, and usually my dad watched the girl but today there was no other solution than for my ex to watch both. The little one wasn't that happy and he refused to go an a walk with them or put them in the car (she usually sleeps then) and visit someone or anything. Only thing he does is put TV on. When I was done after 4 hours work, he lost it on me saying I am ruining the children and if I dont want to be a mother anymore I should tell him, I should be ashamed and so on. And that I should stop with the job until both go to kindergarten and take my old fulltime job again (where I would have to work weekends too, where there's no kindergarten...). So AITA for leaving the kids with him and wanting to work?

Edit after reading the first batch of comments: I didn't want to write down everything cause it's gonna be like a whole book but here we go: I only got to know of his drug problem after he stopped taking it (at least he says so). I knew something was wrong but not what exactly. Baby number 2 was an accident despite of taking birth control (seems to be genetic, I was conceived the same way). His alcohol problem consist of him drinking too much when he leaves the house. He never drinks at home. I work in veterinary medicine and I did think a lot about it but cancelling my shift would have been really uncool - and since he is good with the boy, k had hopes it would work out. I am already in the process of finding a solution to not live together anymore also in Cooperation with social services but so far I haven't found the right solution. I still receive money for staying home with baby, I live in Germany. He has a job in an office but keeps calling out I'll and he works with his own company in the cleaning field. So that's how we pay the bills. Hope that solved all the questions. And yes I definitely won't be doing that again, my dad watched the little on the other occasion but he's on vacation right now. My ex (we're not married) is a real narcissist and he got me thinking of i should quit the job cause he also said he doesn't trust my father... childcare wasn't possible today because it's a holiday today and also I will work two weekends a month",1.0,-0.0019212535116821527,0,0

33,1ggec02,AITA for bringing attention to my parents favoritism of my sister in a public way?,"My parents have my sister Amy (17F) and me (15F). They always liked Amy more. I'm not sure why. I don't know if I'm not their real kid or if they only wanted one kid and I ruined everything but they pay so much attention to Amy, show her so much love, support her in everything and I get nothing from them. My support comes from a couple of extended family members and friends and friends parents.

Examples; Amy since she was in elementary school got to pick what summer camp she went to and she never got told no for where she wanted to go. I was never given a choice. Some years I went to the local free one during the day and other years I went to no summer camp at all.

When Amy turned 8 she got a bedroom makeover and was given her own TV, a cool new bed, a desk space and a new computer and they put a mini fridge in it, all in pink to match her favorite color. I still don't have any of that stuff. The laptop I'm using now was a gift from a family member. When I turned 8 I was given used dolls from the thrift store that were from the dollar store (I saw them enough times to remember). Some were even broken with missing limbs or hair that was half pulled out.

My parents will buy Amy pizza or Taco Bell as a treat for ""being a good daughter"" and ""being their special girl"" and it happens at least 3 times a month where she gets it just because. I never get it just because. I don't even get it for doing good in a test like she would.

They spoil her whenever she does good in a test. I never get spoiled.

They told Amy they have money saved for her future. They never told me that.

I brought it up to my parents before but they brushed me off, even when I cried. My mom told me to stop being so childish.

That's why when my parents had a party Saturday for dad's birthday and they started boasting about Amy and how great her grades were, I kind of lost my temper and asked about me. I pointed out my grades were actually better than hers. But they never talk about me like that. I asked why they only talk about Amy. Why is she their favorite. Why don't they care more about me. My uncle (dad's brother) said out loud that I have a point. But stuff got awkward after and my parents yelled at me for doing that.

36,1gge1tt,AITA for confronting my friend after she screamed at me for missing some messages?,"My (F18) friend Lina (F19) is outspoken and can be intense, while I'm more soft-spoken and avoid conflict. Recently, she missed three days of college (it's the end of the semester, and she didn't want to come) and kept asking me to send her missed notes—which I didn't mind at the time. On the second day, she texted our group chat (there's three of us) to save her a spot in a lecture for a guest speaker. I didn't respond right away—| was busy organizing an event and just caught up in the bustle of the last days of college, so i didn't see her message until later. Our other friend simply doesn't use her phone during college hours, so she didn't see it either.

At lunch, Lina called me, but it was too loud to hear her, so I said I'd call her back. I forgot. Right before the lecture, she showed up furious, yelling at me and our other friend in the hall. I apologized immediately, but she ignored me the whole lecture. Afterward, I tried apologizing again, but she brushed it off, only asking for the work she missed. Later, she sent me a long, heated message, accusing me of disrespecting her and purposely ignoring her. I took accountability and apologized again, despite her reaction being disproportionate to what I did.

Even our other friend thought her behavior was harsh. She completely ignored my apology and only texted me when she wanted notes.
Since then, she's acted like nothing happened, but i feel unsettled. I was shaken by the whole thing and feel like didn't deserve to be spoken to like that, especially since she knows l struggle with conflict. While I do feel an apology was warranted on my part, it seems like she doesn't want my remorse and just wants to ignore me to ""get back"" at me. I brought it up with her and tried to confront her behavior to better understand her feelings and also talk about how her reaction made me uncomfortable but she doesn’t want to talk about it and brushed the whole thing off. 

We're fine now but knowing how she's often in similar conflicts, and other problems that have been coming up in our friendship, this seems like the inciting incident to bigger issues in the future.

Last year, my (20F) parents gifted me a 350 CC cruiser. It was a surprise: my father took me to the showroom to look at the bikes ""for a friend"" (and no I didn't get suspicious, I'm not that smart when it comes to these things), and a few weeks later, it was on our doorstep. Since it was a surprise, they hadn't consulted me about the customisations, so I ended up with a small  front visor with the sticker of a flower. The specific flower was the literal meaning of my name in Persian language. I didn't exactly like the visor(I would've preferred a long visor or no visor at all), but the flower was actually sweet, so I just ignored it. My brother (25) really hated the flower, and always complained about it whenever he had to borrow my bike, but I ignored it.

Anyway, last week, I decided to just take the visor off with the sticker intact and just keep it. The sticker was a nice thoughtful touch by my mother (she calls me her <the flower> a lot, my contact is saved in her phone as the flower etc). I'm currently in the middle of board exams, so I was planning to do it *literally TOMORROW*.

This morning, my brother had to borrow my bike (I didn't mind). Around noon, my mother calls to ask why I let my brother take the sticker off. (I didn't?) So when he called a few minutes ago to ask my mother about some client, I yelled at him and he just asked me to leave it. AITA?

40,1ggdk84,AITA for insisting on having a best woman. ,"Throwaway account and fake names because my fiance uses Reddit. I 28m just proposed to my fiance 26f Sarah. I have one child from my wife passed away in 2021 from the virus. I honestly never thought I'd find love again but I did. The problem is that my fiance doesn't want my best friend Zara 29f to be my best woman. 

For context my best friend and I have been friends since we were seven years old. She and her family moved in next door and we both bonded over not having the best family situations. We've always had quite the sibling bond and even people who don't know us sometimes mistake us for siblings because of the way we interact. I love Zara like a little sister. She was there for me when my mom passed and when my wife passed in 2021. She used to bring over food for my son and I. She and her then boyfriend and now husband would take him out of the house if I just needed to be alone and my son adores her. She's been there for me at my worst and I wanted her to be apart of a new chapter in my life. 

The problem is that my fiance isn't really her biggest fan. When they first meet Sarah said that when she spoke to her she sounded rude and condescending, which is kind of true because Zara has a much deeper voice than most woman and is on the spectrum so she sounds monotonous all the time. I've explained that to Sarah but she thinks it's just an excuse. (I was with Sarah the first time they met and she didn't say anything rude or condescending). She's also very sarcastic so pair that with the voice and people think she's rude. She's actually very kind. She offers to take Sarah out for girls night when she and the other girlfriends of the friend group go, she's made an effort to bond with her but according to Sarah they just don't click which I was fine with because not everyone has to like each other. It's not like they're rude to each other and fight, they're quite friendly and cordial. 

Sarah and I were discussing wedding plans the other day and I brought up having Zara as my best woman and Sarah shot down the idea. When I asked why she said she didn't want Zara to stick out among the other groomsman. I assumed maybe she didn't want Zara to wear a dress because she loves her dresses so I told her she'd be fine wearing a suit but she still said no and I got confused and asked if she didn't want Zara in the wedding party at all and she said yes. She said she didn't want to give  her friends and other people the wrong impression of me (which to me was very childish.) I insisted that I want Zara as my best woman because as much as I consider my fiancee my best friend and want to make her happy, Zara is also an important person in my life and I want her by my side. She got frustrated and isn't speaking to me anymore and her friends think that this means that there's something going on between me and Zara. (She's a married woman who hates cheating with every fibre of her being and I see her as my sister btw.) aita?

ETA: nevermind y'all. Sarah is just islamophobic, jealous and abelist (like some of you pointed out.). This is just a just of the text she sent me today to tell me how she feels. I will be giving you guys a full update later when I get home from work. Thank you all for the support and for those of you who say men and woman can't be friends I hope you get help.

She was there for me when my mom passed and when my wife passed in 2021. She used to bring over food for my son and I. She and her then boyfriend and now husband would take him out of the house if I just needed to be alone and my son adores her. She's been there for me at my worst and I wanted her to be apart of a new chapter in my life. 

The problem is that my fiance isn't really her biggest fan. When they first meet Sarah said that when she spoke to her she sounded rude and condescending, which is kind of true because Zara has a much deeper voice than most woman and is on the spectrum so she sounds monotonous all the time. I've explained that to Sarah but she thinks it's just an excuse. (I was with Sarah the first time they met and she didn't say anything rude or condescending). She's also very sarcastic so pair that with the voice and people think she's rude. She's actually very kind. She offers to take Sarah out for girls night when she and the other girlfriends of the friend group go, she's made an effort to bond with her but according to Sarah they just don't click which I was fine with because not everyone has to like each other. It's not like they're rude to each other and fight, they're quite friendly and cordial. 

Sarah and I were discussing wedding plans the other day and I brought up having Zara as my best woman and Sarah shot down the idea. When I asked why she said she didn't want Zara to stick out among the other groomsman. I assumed maybe she didn't want Zara to wear a dress because she loves her dresses so I told her she'd be fine wearing a suit but she still said no and I got confused and asked if she didn't want Zara in the wedding party at all and she said yes. She said she didn't want to give  her friends and other people the wrong impression of me (which to me was very childish.) I insisted that I want Zara as my best woman because as much as I consider my fiancee my best friend and want to make her happy, Zara is also an important person in my life and I want her by my side. She got frustrated and isn't speaking to me anymore and her friends think that this means that there's something going on between me and Zara. (She's a married woman who hates cheating with every fibre of her being and I see her as my sister btw.) aita?

ETA: nevermind y'all. Sarah is just islamophobic, jealous and abelist (like some of you pointed out.). This is just a just of the text she sent me today to tell me how she feels. I will be giving you guys a full update later when I get home from work. Thank you all for the support and for those of you who say men and woman can't be friends I hope you get help.

41,1ggdju1,WIBTA if I mentioned not knowing all of my grandparents on a writing assignment about grandparents?,"I (15f) have a writing assignment for school where we are supposed to talk about our grandparents. This is (slightly) tricky for me. My dad's parents are fine. I know them. But my granddad (mom's dad) died when my mom was 3 and we never knew him. But his presence is still very strong in our family. My mom has photos of him and trinkets of his that she keeps in our house and she grew up always feeling someone was missing and wishing she could have spent some time with him that she could remember. He was always granddad.

My mom was 6/7 when her stepdad, or Grandpa Joe to me and my siblings, married granny. Even though my mom was so young she never saw Grandpa Joe as her dad or her real parent and she doesn't have as close of a relationship with him as she does granny. And when she had kids she introduced him as Grandpa Joe instead of just the grandparent title like the four bio grandparents are referred to. So we have grandma and grandpa (dad's parents) and granny and granddad (mom's parents) and then we have Grandpa Joe (mom's stepdad).

That's already a sensitive thing. Grandpa Joe hates being singled out as the only one who had his name added. But I think it would be worse if he ever found out that I wrote that I don't know all my grandparents and wrote about granddad. And then it was sort of confirmed because he and granny were over at our house the other night and they decided they wanted to see what my homework was like. My dad told them to leave it in case they deleted anything (neither are good with technology) but Grandpa Joe already saw the line about me not knowing all my grandparents and mentions of granddad. He asked why I needed to talk about granddad when I never knew him and then mentioned that I always had him as a grandfather but made him a step down grandparent to the others who didn't have their name added on.

They left soon after and mom told me to do what I feel is right. She pointed out it's only for school and doesn't need to be too serious or can be more personal if I want.

It's taken a huge toll on my mental health and everyone has been telling me to leave and find something else. An old friend of mine told me that there is a position in his company and if I applied for it I'd most likely get it. The job pays $25,000 more than my current job and the environment would be so much better for me.

I finished up the details of my resume but before I sent it off to the company my gf told me she wanted to take a look at it before I sent it off. I sent her a copy and she told me it was terrible and that she would fix it up for me so I could send it off. That was two weeks ago now. My girlfriend is a massive procrastinator and she always reassures me that she would do it by saying things like ""it'll only take me 5 min to finish it up. I will work on it in the morning"" or ""I have a work meeting at x time so I will work on it then"" or ""let me get settled in first and then I will finish it"". There have been times where I've told her that I would just send in what she has already done and she has expressed frustration with me because I talk to her like that and she keeps telling me I need to have patience. 

Yesterday we were on the couch and I got a text from my friend telling me the position was taken by someone else and he apologized. I showed my girlfriend the text and she said ""ohhh fuck. Okay let me work on it right now"" but I told her it was too late. She asked me if I was angry with her and I was trying my best not to yell but I snapped back ""of course I am mad at you, it's your fault"". She started crying and she called me an asshole for not being appreciative of her and that she did something good for me and now I am throwing it in her face. This is when I snapped and said ""You didn't do fucking shit for me. You had 2 weeks to do this. I was happy with what I wrote and you stopped me from sending it. If I had sent it when I did at least I'd have a chance. I had to fucking chase you nearly everyday for this and you didn't do fuck all"" she really started crying and she locked herself in the bedroom all night. 

She snuck out for work this morning and hasn't texted me. I am starting to have regret for the way I handled it but I was (and still am) very angry.

43,1ggbme8,AITA for not giving attention to my brother's girlfriend ?,"Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

Recently my brother (25m) brought is girlfriend home to meet the family. She stayed for 2 days.
For some context, my brother told us beforehand that she was stressed about meeting us since she come from a small family. My family consist of me(19f), my sister(21), my brother(her boyfriend), my other brother(27 and 29), my sister in law(28) and my nephew(2 month) and my two parents. Since we knew she was a bit scared, we decide to try and not overwhelmed her by asking to much question.

They both arrived Friday evening at 22h30. Since I was up, I greet them with my parents before going to sleep unlike my sister who was in her bed.
The morning after, my brother(29), his wife, her sister and their kid arrive.
In total we were 10.
We spend the Saturday spending time all together, playing board game...
In the evening we had an apero were we officially welcome her with a cheer.

On Sunday my brother send a long text without even talking to her directly to reprimand her because she ""didn't greet his girlfriend properly"" even though she did but on Saturday morning. That made her cry a lot because she didn't understand what she did wrong.
After that we spend the whole day discussing and catching up.
She left after dinner, my brother drove her back to the train station before coming back home.

Here come the real issue. Apparently, we didn't give her enough attention throughout the weekend, she felt unwelcomed and complained to my brother in the car. On Monday, (I had already left) my brother and my mother had an argument about the whole story and my mom I scared that my brother is getting manipulated by is girlfriend because he would never have done that before.

Personally, I don't appreciate his girlfriend. She didn't help in cooking, putting the table together, she didn't even directly interact with any of us, we were the one talking to her. I was ready to look over it because she make my brother happy but after hearing that she complained, I'm not so sure.

44,1ggb7ua,AITA for not babying my partner,"I (19F) and my partner (20NB) have been together for a few years, the other day I got into a pretty heated argument with their mother and wanted to hear second opinions, as she continues to be steadfast in her belief that she was in the right, but i'm still pretty heated over this.

My partner and I have a dynamic that isn't very involved in each other's daily routines other than telling eachother how our days went and catching up, I don't have their routine memorized and they don't have my routine memorized and both of our routines switch around often, this is perfectly ok with both of us.

We live in one of the most expensive cities in North America, and because of this most students that are able to are still living at home with their parents (while finanically contributing to the household in some capacity).

The other day I went to visit my partner at the end of the day, I asked if they wanted to go for a drive and they agreed, we drove around for a couple hours and got back pretty late. When we got back their mom asked to speak to them privately, I waited in the other room for them.

As I waited their mom entered the room in a very heated way and began tearing into me for taking them out late on a school night. I responded that I didn't know and either way, as much as I want to support them I don't understand why I was being blamed for my partner's decision, their mom responded saying that they ""didn't have the strength to make the right decision"", I was extremely taken aback by the implication that I was responsible for my partner's choice and that I should be responsible for their life to an uncomfortable extent, she then went on to imply i didn't care about my partner.

I understand her want to support her child in succeeding academically (even if i think it's sometimes overbearing) and at the end of the day it's her house.

45,1ggb6x4,AITA for refusing to bring back the full auntie/niblings day even though it would help out my SIL out?,"Throwaway because I don't want my people that know me reading this.

I \[24F\] am the youngest to 3 brothers \[36M\], \[34M\], \[31M\]. Yes, I was the surprise baby and yes, I was coddled growing up. They're all married and I get along really well with my SILs. Between the 3 of them, I have 7 niblings  all of them under 10 and one of my SILs is pregnant with the 8th. She's my middle brother's wife and they already have two kids.

Here's the problem. When it used to be just 3 niblings, I used to have full auntie/niblings day where I would basically take them out from sunrise to sunset, sometimes it was in the middle of the week, sometimes in the weekend depending on my work/social schedules.

From the start, I made my boundaries clear because I had read horror stories about babysitting. I basically said that I will only offer that 1 day a week of auntie fun/babysitting and will only babysit otherwise if there was extreme circumstances, for example when one of my SILs had their second baby, I was more than happy to have their toddler over for a four days sleepover until they were out of the hospital and settled at home.

With each added member to our days, it became my worst nightmare to handle that many kids alone. Say what you want about me but that's a lot of responsibility and a lot of kids and just one me. So I started cutting the time and mixing and matching. Still same day but for example, I take one of my brothers' kids for something fun at breakfast. Another brother's kids to lunch and the last brother's kids to dinner and I'd mix it up the next week. No one had any problems with it.

Now that my SIL is heavily pregnant, 31 weeks, with their 3rd kid, she brought up the thought of me maybe keeping her kids all day and bringing them to stuff with the other niblings because she used to use that as a selfcare day for herself. I turned her down and told her my reasons 1) It would still be a lot of kids to handle if we merge, 5-6 and 2) it wouldn't be fair to the rest of my niblings.

She understood (no crazy, selfish SILs here) but I could feel her disappointment and that has me feeling guilty because I'm not a mom, I have no idea how hard it is for her. My brother talked to me after that and asked if I would reconsider if he sends their usual babysitter with me to help out? I told him I'd think about it but I don't want to be unfair to the other kids, plus, I don't know this person that he would be sending with me.

AITA if I also turn down that offer?

Edit: I want to say thank you for all your takes, I thought making an edit would be easier than replying to every comment, as much as I wish I can reply to everyone.

I just want to clarify first that I came up with the whole niblings day because I grew up somewhat close to my brothers despite the age gaps. Obviously we grew a part a bit when life started happening for them, they all moved out/went to college and here I was still in middle school but we got close again when I grew up and started to relate to them more. Anyway, that's all to say that I made the day so the kids and I have a relationship and their parents getting a small break was just an added bonus- something that I may need to remind them of.

A lot of people asked why my brother or other brothers don't have uncle days or trade off kids to give their wives time off and it's mostly because their schedules are rarely in sync unless it's around the holidays- we all get together then and they all divide the childcare among themselves, my dad pitches in too, and their wives (our mom and me) don't lift a finger. As for why parents don't help, they used to until my mom had hip surgery and they made it clear that they'll pitch in when they can but not to rely on them and my pregnant SIL's parents are hours away. 

As for the babysitter, I don't think it's that wild that they don't send her out in public with the kids but what do I know, I don't have kids lol. If they send her out with me, I think it would be awkward and uncomfortable because what if her caring style is different than mine? What if she thinks something is okay and I don't or the opposite? Who will the kids ask permission from? What if some of the kids ask something of her and she says yes and they run off while I'm busy with the others and I end up not keeping track of them? I'm the type that I need to know where every little one is at all times and at the end of the day, I wouldn't be her boss and have no right to ask stuff of her like I am.

As for my SILs, the pregnant one is a SAHM while the other two work so I imagine they want to wind down at home as well in the weekends with their family, Idk, I'm close to them but I don't ask them what they do (that's just weird because they're married to my brothers) unless they volunteer it in conversation.

A lot of you suggested I alternate between sets of kids each week but that would mean that I would only see each of them one time a month and I don't know about that yet. I know I'll have to dial back at some point and it won't always be this way but they're still so young and cute that I don't have the heart to pull the plug on our days. I do agree that we need to have a talk and that some things need to change though.

And finally, how I can even afford to do this every week, I'm a tech girly and was lucky enough to land a cushy job that's also flexible when it comes to remote/office time. My social life is healthy, guys, I don't just spend my time around family and I am dating, or trying to at least.

My social life is healthy, guys, I don't just spend my time around family and I am dating, or trying to at least. It's not easy in the 2024 dating pool- no offense to any guys I'm sure you're all lovely.

If I have news and you guys are interested, I'll update!",0.0,0.9983322620391846,1,0
46,1ggb0tj,AITA for not giving space,"Me and my partner have been together for 3 years. When we got together we had both come out of long term relationships, I had to move back in with my Mum and he with his. 
He has a mortgage with his ex and 2 beautiful children male 11 and female 6. I think the world of them, and love the time together.
I finally brought my first home and moved in March, my partner also moved in with me. I made sure there was a room and space for the kids. They stay with us half the week. Whilst my partner cannot pay a huge amount due to still giving money to his ex he does contribute something.
Recently my partner has been away on a boys tour, he does this every October and looks forward to it. During this time I sent the usual loved up messages and so did he. He was due back on the Monday the same day as me (I was working on a residential for SEN children). I had asked if we could have that evening together as I knew I would be tired from the trip and wanted to get the home in order before having the kids round for the half term holidays. He told me he would sort it, unfortunately he did not and the kids were at the home on Monday. Whilst I was disappointed that he had not sorted it, we got on. The kids went to bed, we cleaned what we could. 
When going to bed he mentioned he had been hurt on tour, he showed me a bruise on his bum. I was surprised he hadn't mentioned anything since then, especially as he will message me most injuries (cut toe, cut finger, bruise etc). I asked why he hadn't mentioned this in text and he said he didn't want to worry me. This was said on the Monday, I accepted this and we went to bed. 
On Wednesday evening we had a couple of drinks. I enquired about the bruise again and mentioned how it didn't make sense he hadn't said anything. He got angry with me when I noted his story of who was there and what happened changed. He started to say how I just never drop anything and he couldn't believe I was going on about it. He then left the room and I followed at this point he was angry and I was upset. I should have given him the space but I was upset and wanted to sort this out especially as he has been distant since returning (both of us have, but put this down to tiredness). When I followed he started to shout, I asked him to keep his voice down as the kids were in bed, he responded by saying he wanted them to hear and if he hadn't been drinking he would have taken the kids and left. 
I left the home and slept in my car to allow him the space. I returned at aroind 1am and spent the remainder of the night on the sofa. This morning he won't even look at me and has told me he needs to decide what to do as I called him a liar. 
I am so confused by this, I love him so much yes I should have given him the space but I was so surprised and wanted to understand. 
We usually get on so well, but I think I have lost him and he doesn't want to be with me anymore. Any advice or AITAH and need to accept it.

47,1ggaata,AITA for Pretending to be excited to my boyfriend,"I (28F) have been without a job for about a month. The entire time I've been mass applying to cashier and retail jobs in my area because they're always hiring and it's relatively easy to get hired. One of those places was AutoZone. my bf (35M) suggested it because his friend's mom is one of the District Managers for the stores in our area so i'd definitely get an interview at least. I didn't want to apply because I don't know shit about car parts nor do I want to work somewhere I'd have predominantly male coworkers due to not so great experiences at previous jobs with mainly male coworkers. My bf kept bringing it up every time we had a conversation about my job applications so I bit the bullet and applied just to shut him up. Well, turns out that they have been the only place that has gotten back to me about my application, I interviewed over the phone, and got hired...great 🙄🙄🙄. I have new hire orientation today from 8-4 and am not at all excited about it. Before we went to lay down in bed, he asked me if I was excited about orientation and the job. Im not but, just so he doesn't bother me about it anymore, I pretended to be. I'm honestly debating not going to the orientation and telling him I went because he doesn't get home until 5:30. The only thing is that if I don't go but say I did, what if his friends mom says something to the friend about me not being there and the friend snitches on me? Then I have a whole other can of worms to deal with.

I do not want to work there at all. Like since finding out I was hired, my entire mood has been different and even my bf has said that I ""don't seem myself"". I can't deal with him bothering me about it so I don't tell him that I don't want to work there and am miserable because of it.

49,1gg9ug4,AITA for not going on a trip with my Mom this year?,"I (23F) and my mom (67F) have been arguing about a trip to FL for Christmas. Since I was a baby she took me every Christmas to visit her family in FL. We live in IL. But during covid we didn't go for 2 years.  We went in 2023 but I wasn't sure about going this year. I've always gone along with her because I had to when I was younger, but never really enjoyed as I got older since I don't know the family that well and it's not where I grew up. I brought up that I wanted to stay and she can go by herself. I have a boyfriend and a job and I honestly don't want to go anymore.



In 2024 my mom got diagnosed with stage 2 parkinsons and is experiencing small difficulties with movement but can still get around and walk. When I told her I wanted her to go without me this year, she said that I need to go because I can stop her from falling. I said if she thinks she'll fall she can use a wheelchair and that she will be ok.  She kept saying I'm not gonna do that, you have to come with me. She then mentioned that this one time I left the FL trip early to go home by myself that she had an anxiety attack and that she can't do that again. 



I feel she may just be trying to guilt trip me, because 2 months ago she had a high school reunion invite in FL. She was undecided but eventually said she didn't want to go. But today she said I took her reunion away from her and now I'm taking FL in Christmas too because she can't go without me because of her fear of falling. I did have a planned trip to Japan in the middle of her reunion date and I told her I could take the bus to the airport if she wanted to go to the reunion, but she said she didn't want to go and ended up dropping me off at the airport. Now today during our argument she's saying I prevented her from going to her reunion because of my trip even though I suggested the bus, and was saying she would have gone to the reunion if not for my trip/taking me to the airport. So I mentioned to her, both the Christmas family event and the high school reunion are in FL, why are you saying you would have been fine traveling alone for the reunion if not for my trip but you can't travel alone for this Christmas trip? She just kept telling me to shut up.



She says I'm selfish now and horrible. I feel justified in saying I don't want to go because I've gone for so long for these yearly trips, and she can still go without me and I think she needs to get over her fear of traveling alone and although she has parkinsons now, she can still use a wheelchair. She keeps saying I could stop her from falling, but I'm not sure if I could. I want to know if this is rude of me or is it fair to not go this year? I feel like I am an adult now and I shouldn't still be expected to go and it seems unfair to me that she keeps insulting me now. No one from FL ever comes to visit us, it just feels unfair to me that we're expected to always leave and go for weeks every year, so I just wanted to take a break. I suggested perhaps I can go next year.

My fiance and I live in a camper. There is not much space here, and while it can comfortably SLEEP ten people, it's barely enough space and not enough privacy for the two of us.

My fiance's sister (Sister) recently told us that her living situation had become intolerable. I won't go into the details lest we be here for days. But her aunt (Aunt) offered to allow her and her two children to live with Aunt. Aunt didn't have enough room for Sister's boyfriend (Boyfriend), however. So Sister asked if it was okay to let Boyfriend stay here with us in our camper for a while so that they can independently get jobs, save up money, and get everything together.

We agreed.

Boyfriend has been here for about three weeks now. Aunt just told my fiance last night that Sister and Boyfriend are broken up.

I was outraged. I was under the impression that the entire purpose of this was to help the family get back on their feet; I feel like it's a completely different scenario when you're asking me to invite this person into my house and asking me to change a lot about my life in order to help some random dude. It felt like Sister was just trying to pawn Boyfriend off on us instead of dealing with the breakup like an adult.

I asked Sister when they had broken up. She came at me aggressively saying it's none of my business, but eventually conceded that they had broken up months ago. Moments later, I am receiving messages from Aunt making comments about how I'm ""unable to just help someone out of the kindness of my heart"". Aunt later went on to say that ""[I] just don't want a third person in my camper"".

We have helped people before. Friends, even strangers. We had invited someone to live permanently with us at one point. I have no problem with a third person here. I simply felt like I was lied to about the entire scenario, then later treated like a villain when I tried to ask questions about what was truly going on.

My fiance pretty much agrees. They even tried throwing him under the bus by saying that he has known all along that they were broken up. Even though the reason I brought it up was because my fiance was outraged when he learned about it last night.

I don't feel that I'm wrong in wanting to know more information about the person I'm inviting into my home and the circumstances that brought him here. And I wasn't aggressive in the way that I went about asking these questions despite being infuriated. Yet I was personally attacked multiple times.

51,1gg9six,AITA for wanting an apology from my former friend for making my proposal all about her?,"I (29M) proposed to my girlfriend (25F), now wife, in March 2024 and my former friend (24F) was and still is upset 7 months later.

I proposed to my girlfriend by doing a donut around her while my two best friends did a burnout nearby. Everything went well and she said yes! We are now married and everything has been great. The only issue has been that one of my former friend (""Jane"") was very upset on how I proposed and the type of ring I used as she claimed I stole her ideas and involved her boyfriend (one of my best friends).

I have been friends with her and her boyfriend for two years and I would say I was reason of them getting together. I was their confidant and we shared a lot of good memories together.

The ring and the event itself, to my understanding, are the main reasons according to her.

During the holidays we went together to shop for gifts. During the trip, she wanted to stop by a Moissanite store to show her boyfriend some rings and I went with them. I never really liked diamonds and was trying to find alternatives so I thought moissanite was a good option.

Jane was about 4 months pregnant. My best friend (her boyfriend) had seen a video on IG about a burnout gender reveal and wanted to do the same thing. I suggested a spot I knew that would perfect.

My wife and I are really big car people. We met after she saw one of my cars at a show. She DMd me and on our first date we did donuts on the spot I would later propose and the place I would suggest for them to do the gender reveal.

After I proposed, Jane started acting wierd. She leaves all the group chats and she turns off her location, etc. I asked her what was wrong and tells me she is upset that ""I stole her idea"" and involved her boyfriend. I tried to explain my rationale to why I propose the way I did but she didn't care. I apologized as it was never my intention to ""steal her idea"" but she didn't care.

I gave her time because she's hormonal due to pregnancy. 

I learned later that she had apparently been bother about the ring for awhile. She had told another friend about it but she never told me anything even after I showed it to her before I proposed.

Months go by and I stop trying to apologize. I wish her well wishes for the delivery. After her baby was born I had some hope she would reach out but she never did.

The more time passes the more I know I did anything wrong. If you google diamond ring alternative Moissanite is the first result and a gender reveal burnout is nothing unique. She never communicated anything to me even after she knew about the ring and proposal. She made my whole proposal about herself and now have ruined a special moment.

I told my best friend how I felt and that I'm owed an apology and he agreed and said he would tell her.

52,1gg81zh,AITA FOR NOT SAYING THANK YOU TO MY PARENTS ,"Hello, i 18F am on holiday with my family in Bali and we leave to go back home in 3 days, we have been here for around 2 weeks and a half and have been out and about almost everyday so for the last 3 days wanted to relax, yesterday I sat around in the hotel room sleeping and today I was going to do the same thing but my parents wanted to go out again and came into my room screaming at me that I’ve done nothing all day but be on my phone so I retorted saying that it’s a holiday and that I’m aloud to relax, so my mum dragged me to my room and began doing my hair and filing down my nails. I’m a nail bitter so my nails are quite short as it is so I was asking her to stop because she was filing them down to Much and it was beginning to hurt. So I pulled my hand away and she grabbed it back again. Once she was done I glared at her and got up and she started screaming at me saying I’m very unappreciative and she snatched my phone away along with my key to my room and told me to get out and ask the staff for a new one because I was being a B!tch.

I’m a nail bitter so my nails are quite short as it is so I was asking her to stop because she was filing them down to Much and it was beginning to hurt. So I pulled my hand away and she grabbed it back again. Once she was done I glared at her and got up and she started screaming at me saying I’m very unappreciative and she snatched my phone away along with my key to my room and told me to get out and ask the staff for a new one because I was being a B!tch.

I 31 F am married to my husband 34 M. We have a 15 month old son together and typically get along very well. For some context my husband and I have been together for 7 years and married for 3 years.  Here is my problem… last year for the holidays neither of us went to any of our families holiday celebrations due to our son being very young at the time. This year both of our families want to get together for thanksgiving. I come from a very large family ( around 75 people in total). And my husband only celebrates holidays with his mother, father and his younger sister. A couple days ago we were discussing our plans for thanksgiving. My husband stated he wanted us to spend thanksgiving with his family due to not attending last year. For context his family lives 5 hours away from us. While my family is about 2 hours away. I reminded him we didn’t attend my families thanksgiving either the year prior. Therefore I came up with the idea and asked for his opinion today. I suggest we go see his family the  weekend before thanksgiving to spend time with his family and attend my families thanksgiving on thanksgiving day. My husband did not like this suggestion and said his mother would be disappointed. He is now distant and not talking to me.

54,1gg7n7w,AITA for blocking my step mother in law ,"So long story short, my husband’s parents are divorced and his dad found a new partner rather quickly if you know what I mean. Anyways, the lady has been nothing but disrespectful from the start but I’ve always stayed out of it as it’s not my family drama and I know exactly the type of woman she is. 

Two years ago, she started drama with me over the fact that I mentioned it would be great if we all spent Christmas together in a city/home that was bought by my husband’s parents before the divorce and the father kept it after. She took it as me inviting her to “her own home” and demanded I apologize. It’s been basically two years since the debacle and my husband has tried to have sit down convos with her but she is extremely irrational and entitled. A lot has happened since then but back in April 2024, she left notes in that house in places where someone staying in the house would find them e.g. the bathroom drawer. The notes said “don’t be curious” as to catch me snooping. Well during our stay in the summer, I decided to, with my toddler son, write a message back saying “be kind and stay curious” and leave it on the console table (edit: that is an asshole move). 

She also has an issue with our cat staying there and blames him for random stuff that he doesn’t do.  Edit to addd: the owner of the house, the dad, has never told us we couldn’t bring the cat. 

My husband’s father is a complete coward and when confronted stays silent but allows her to speak to his sons in awful ways. 

They are at the house now and she sent me a message berating me and my husband for bringing the cat which meant the dad having to vacuum (he’s been there multiple times since the cat and hasn’t said anything and when we stayed, we had a cleaning lady).

anyways, her message was extremely nasty and called me uneducated, selfish, and ill mannered for leaving the note and “snooping”. I didn’t snoop or look into her personal items. I simply put my makeup in the bathroom drawer.

SO AITA for blocking her number and not responding and waiting until I see the father to tell him off as now I’m included in this woman’s wrath?

55,1gg7h64,WIBTA - if I let my parents stay with my girlfriend and I?,"WIBTA - Allowing my parents to stay with my girlfriend and I?

I (27M) live with my girlfriend (28F) in a townhome I (100%) bought for about a year now. We have been together for eight years, four of them through college. Our relationship is healthy and we really don't have any issues until it's something she doesn't agree with (lol) typically regarding my parents.

I am someone that goes with the flow and does whatever I want in a respectable/compromising manner. My girlfriend is similar but has extreme OCD and control issues over situations. I get amused by how much it pains her that she doesn't have control or any info on a quick weekend getaway I sometimes surprise her with.

My parents recently just moved to NC, now being 9+ hours away, my girlfriend doesn't want them staying with us for a week to celebrate my sister's birthday and Christmas. She thinks they assume they are allowed to stay, which I believe is half true, truthfully I could care less. They will be traveling with the family dog which we all love and I so happen to just offer the best environment.

My parents are very laid back as well and try to stay out of our ways. They would 100% offer to cook dinner go on any errands (grocery store, etc.), do the laundry, or vacuum the house. My girlfriend has voiced her opinion, I listened and told her give me time to process so I dont say anything I regret. Ultimately she said, she is fine if they visit (1-3 days) whenever but I guess a week is too long as it disrupts her normal routine (typical work week). This argument doesnt apply in my opinion because we are off from work when they would be visiting. She doesn't want to give them the impression that if they visit they can stay with us.

My girlfriend's famous remark to disagreements regarding my parents is, ""my parents would never"". I told her early on when these arguments started that this does not involve your parents at all and if roles were reversed and your parents moved and were visiting I wouldn't care at all even though her mom would make both of us go shot for shot on a bottle every day. I feel like I suck it up and adapt to the current situation regarding her family events/gatherings, where she doesn't want to entertain it at all. Every situation and or even visit is different and requires communication. If I don't see it being a completely blatant issue I am fine with it.

Today's Events -

She asked my mom to stay in airbnb/hotel today without talking to me first or have me atleast tell them myself. Now I am in the middle of my mom not feeling wanted and my girlfriend's concerns. Family is family and I would do anything for mine and for hers regardless if I will dread it or not.

Would I be an asshole for just putting an end to the back and forth and just make the final decision to allow them to stay the whole week, having it be my townhome?

I want to propose early next year, but this issue is raising a red flag for me.

Since about May of this year I had the date and time saved in my calendar which was October 19th at 7pm. I was helping her plan her cake, invitations and many other things, and lent her cocktail jugs and graze boards of mine for the party. 
In June of this year, i bought tickets to an event/concert with my other friend for the 26th of October, and after we bought the tickets, it is literally all we talked about we have been so excited for it.

On thursday the 10th of October, i saw the birthday girl for a catch up and to give her all the things im lending her for the party. When saying goodbye I said i’d see her next weekend for her party, and she said my party isn’t next weekend, it’s the weekend after. So I then realised that she had changed the date (and not let me know) to the date which i had this concert on. 
She did send out invitations a few days before that, however i didn’t think it was necessary to read it as I already had all the details in my phone, and had for many months! 

I was visibly upset and so disappointed that i was now in a very hard position and potentially had a to miss her party. 

She then called me a week later to ask if i had sold my ticket yet, and i told her that i had made the decision to go to this concert instead of her birthday, she was trying to come up with solutions for me to go to her birthday instead… saying she can pay me the amount that i paid for the ticket, or i could sell it to one of my friends other friends. 
She then ran out of solutions and got annoyed and ended the call. 

For the next two weeks leading up to the date of her party (26th october) she wasn’t answering any of my texts on any platforms and completely ghosted me. 

On the day of her party, i asked if she was home and got no reply. so i dropped her flowers, a makeup bag i sewed for her and bought all the makeup i did her practice bday makeup with, at her house (she lives 45 mins away)

She answered my text three hours later saying… “just got home, thank you.”

and has ghosted me again ever since. 

Additionally… her actual birthday isn’t even until mid November, and i told her i had another suprise planned for her since i couldn’t attend her party.

I told them not to put everything here because we were only at the ER, but they said they were just going to grab some lunch. There were about 2 big carrier bags of clothes, 1 bag of carpet and pillow, and two plastic bags of snacks. I also had my bag for my personal belongings. They never came back.

At some point, my dad had to be taken away for MRI, my mum went with him and left me alone. Not even five minutes later, a nurse came and told me that they're going to admit a new patient, so I had to take all of my stuff away. I was alone, stressed out, sad, worried, and now pissed, and it was hectic, so I had to carry 6 bags + my own bag to the waiting room by myself asap. And when I got there, my aunt was on her phone and just waved at me. She didn't even stand up to help. I was on the verge of crying so I vented it out, saying something like 'I said not to bring too much stuff!', and my voice might sounded harsh but I was frustrated. My aunt yelled back at me saying 'Don't you scold at me', I fell silent and cried silently. She left with her carpet and pillow after that.

A few minutes later my mum came back and told me my aunt texted my mum telling her to educate me about manners. I didn't care much about it because I wanted to focus on my dad.

I had to leave our bags unattended at the waiting room when my mum and I had to sign my dad's surgery so I texted my uncle to come and help with the bags. He asked about my aunt so I told him she got cranky and left because 'I scolded her'. My dumb uncle forwarded my texts to my aunt, and immediately after that, my mum's phone was bombarded with angry texts from my aunt. Because my mum was busy with the paperwork (and I know she was stressing out too) I took her phone and fired back. I had enough when she said “I had two appointments today, but I cancelled it because I wanted to help out at the hospital"". I chose not to reply.

My mum and I ended up apologising later that night through text. She didn't reply mine, but she did reply my mum's with more rants about how I was always a brat who yells at her parents all the time and never been taught manners, and how her son never raised his voice and hurt her feelings at all.

62,1gg67hz,AITA For writing about my S/O in a locked journal he doesn’t have the code to? ,"In November 2023 (almost exactly 1 year ago) I (29F) was diagnosed with BPD1. I took the diagnosis really hard. I immediately got on a waitlist to start getting therapy and began taking medication to manage my symptoms. 
My significant other (let’s call him, Zack. 29M) was very understanding initially and also said that it made a lot of sense. He was very supportive the first month… or so. Then he would just use my diagnosis as the excuse for everything. Our fights, disagreements, why I did this, why he did that.
March of 2024, I finally made it to the top of the waitlist and got in to the therapy I desperately needed. A few sessions in and one thing my therapist recommended was getting a locking journal that I could write all of my most purely brutal and honest thoughts, feelings, triggers and so on in. Zack  encouraged this idea and thought it would be a healthy coping skill. I went straight to Amazon and found a decent quality leather journal with a lock that requires a 3 number code to unlock and ordered it. 
I used it for exactly what we had discussed me using it for. Unfiltered, raw, deep personal thoughts that I THOUGHT only I would ever read. For the last 7 months, Zack never once touched my journal…until last night. 
I was gone when he began blowing up my phone saying things like “We are fucking done, I hate you, I’m leaving the second you get home” and “I can’t believe you, you fucking disgust me” so on and so on. I was confused and started asking what the hell he was talking about and what happened. That’s when he tells me that he broke in to my journal and he read everything. 
Maybe it sounds silly but it made me feel so violated and exposed. I didn’t know what to do or even say. I definitely had moments in there that I know for a fact that I wrote some really messed up things about him, including one point where I questioned if I were falling out of love with him and possibly hated/resented him. These, again, were temporary thoughts/feelings that I wrote in moments of anger/sadness/confusion and I wholeheartedly thought that the only person who would ever read them, EVER, would be me, myself and I. I said those things to vent and get them off my chest and out of my head without negatively affecting or damaging my relationship.

63,1gg620x,AITA for bringing up why my (F29) dad (M60) took our picture the other day?,"I don’t even know if I should bring it up but here’s the backstory.

I was visiting at my dad’s house yesterday. He received a phone call and stepped out of the room. I didn’t think anything of this because that is normal behavior for him (he’s a very secretive person).

He only stepped into a nearby room so I could still hear his responses. He told whoever he was talking to that his daughter was visiting and that he’d be able to call them later. After waiting for the other person to talk, he responded with “no… that’s not the case”. The other person talked for a few minutes and my dad responded with “I will call you around 5:30” and hung up. As he’s walking toward me, he puts his arm around my shoulder and pulls out his front camera as if he’s trying to take a selfie. I ask him what he’s doing and he responds “we don’t have any pictures together.” I find this odd but smile for the photo. I then say “actually we have one from when I lived with you a few years ago”. He responds with “yeah but we don’t have any recent photos”. 

The lighting was terrible, the angle was terrible, and overall it was not the time to randomly have a father-daughter photo shoot. We go down to his garage because he wanted my help with his car radio before that random phone call. As I’m getting into the passenger side, I see him text our new selfie to someone. He then puts his phone back in his pocket.

Am I overthinking or do these events seem strange? As a victim of abuse, I remember having to prove to my abuser who I was with and where. This seemed A LOT like that.

What should I do? My dad is a very secretive person and has a looooong history of lying. Is it possible he’s just dating someone and they already caught him in a lie and now they have trust issues? Or is he possibly in an abusive relationship with someone who is insanely controlling?

65,1gg5n0b,AITA for bailing on an acquaintance in the middle of story time?,"This incident happened last week and I'm feeling pretty guilty about it, so I wanted to reach out to random internet strangers to see if my guilt is warranted or not.

A couple weeks ago I attended a wedding shower for my cousin. An old friend of hers (who we'll call Stacy) was there with her 10- month- old, and I had brought my 2- year- old.

We got to talking about mom stuff, and she mentioned that she had been taking her daughter to a weekly story time, hosted by a local business. She said that we should join them at the next one, that it would be nice to know someone there, and I agreed. We also added each other on Facebook.

The next story time day rolled around, and my daughter and I showed up to the venue a few minutes early. We found a seat on the floor near the front, and I did my best to entertain her while we waited.

The place quickly filled up with people, and I do mean filled up. We were soon squished shoulder to shoulder with parents and grandparents and kids. Stacy and her baby didn't arrive until about 15 minutes after the story was supposed to have started, and squeezed in next to us.

We continued to wait for another few minutes, and I mentioned the delayed start to Stacy. She responded, ""oh yeah, they always start late."" Which, like, thanks for the heads up.

At this point my daughter is absolutely not having a good time. Waiting around for 20 minutes in toddler time is like forever, especially when mom didn't come prepared for a wait.

Finally, they get the event going, and they start by listing all of the local businesses who helped sponsored the event. I'm trying to keep my daughter still and quiet, but other parents are letting their kids scream and run around, literally stepping on people.

The host then moved on to going over their event calendar for the rest of the year, and at this point I just couldn't take anymore. I leaned over to Stacy and told her that story time just wasn't a good fit for us, and we were going to leave. I told her to message me on Facebook if she wanted to set up a play date.

I wound up taking my daughter to the park instead, which is a better fit for her energy level.

Later that day, I saw that Stacy had made a post on Facebook that was getting a lot of attention. She talked about how hard it was to make mom friends, and how much she had struggled to get out and do things since her baby was born.

I felt pretty bad then. Like, she had really been looking forward to us hanging out and I had just bailed on her.

67,1gg5hxk,AITA for Telling my Fiancé I Disagree With his Mom's Extended Stay?,"Here’s the situation: My fiancé (24) and I (24) plan to get legally married soon, with a larger celebration later on due to finances. His mother, who he hasn’t seen in over 10 years, lives in a village abroad where visiting is challenging, both because of travel restrictions and local religious customs that would prevent us from staying together. So, we decided to save up to bring her here for about a month after we get married/move out to our apartment, cover airport assistance for her, and take her to some places in the U.S. since it’s been so long.

A bit of background: She used to live in the U.S. with my fiancé’s dad, but after their divorce, she moved back to her home country with my fiancé. My fiancé’s dad eventually brought him back to the U.S. to live with his older sibling and go to school, as his mother didn’t prioritize his education (he had been living with her for over a year and was never enrolled in school). A couple of months after, his sibling and his wife had a baby, so his stay was no longer welcome at his house and was told to move out (age 17). Then my fiancé moved out on his own, working and going to high school at the same time to support himself. Since then, he’s been completely independent.

However, his mom says she won’t come unless she can stay for at least four months, and even rejected his offer to extend her stay to two months. We will be newly married, and I haven’t met her in person yet, on top of that, she is extremely religious, so it feels overwhelming to host her for so long. She also mentioned needing to settle things at home, like selling land, which makes us suspect she may plan to stay indefinitely.

She initially agreed to visit for a month before we got engaged, but now that our marriage and move-in date are set, she’s insisting on this longer visit. It breaks my heart to see how excited he was to finally be able to bring her here, but she pretty much gave him an ultimatum. If it is not at least 4 months, she won't come. I thought any mother would be excited to see her son after so long. 

I told him I do not want her staying for so long, especially since she is not giving us a valid reason for an extended stay, other than ""It doesn't make sense for her to come for JUST a month.""

AITA?",Not the A-hole,2024-10-31,"AITA for Telling my Fiancé I Disagree With his Mom's Extended Stay? Here’s the situation: My fiancé (24) and I (24) plan to get legally married soon, with a larger celebration later on due to finances. His mother, who he hasn’t seen in over 10 years, lives in a village abroad where visiting is challenging, both because of travel restrictions and local religious customs that would prevent us from staying together. So, we decided to save up to bring her here for about a month after we get married/move out to our apartment, cover airport assistance for her, and take her to some places in the U.S. since it’s been so long.

A bit of background: She used to live in the U.S. with my fiancé’s dad, but after their divorce, she moved back to her home country with my fiancé. My fiancé’s dad eventually brought him back to the U.S. to live with his older sibling and go to school, as his mother didn’t prioritize his education (he had been living with her for over a year and was never enrolled in school). A couple of months after, his sibling and his wife had a baby, so his stay was no longer welcome at his house and was told to move out (age 17). Then my fiancé moved out on his own, working and going to high school at the same time to support himself. Since then, he’s been completely independent.

69,1gg4wr7,AITA for Reporting a Neighbor for Putting Multiple Mobile Homes on Their Property?,"
Hi everyone, I’m in a bit of a tricky situation with a property near me, more so backing up to my back fence, and I could use some outside opinions. I live in an R1-zoned neighborhood, which is for single-family homes. Recently, a neighbor inherited a piece of land behind me, 3 acres. After moving a couple of mobile homes onto the property (30 feet off my fence line on the back of the acreage), they mentioned plans to add a third and also operate an in-home daycare in in of them (which is not illegal). I noticed that none of this was filed with the county assessor. Their mobile homes are 30 feet off my fence line at the back of their property budding to my back yard fence. According to the city ordinance the definition of Mobile Home Park: an officially approved unified development for two or more mobile homes spaces, arranged on a track of land under single ownerships. Checked with the county assessor and no paperwork has been filed and it still shows one person owning the 3 acres. A mobile home park can not be on R1 zoned land. 

I contacted the local code enforcement officer, who confirmed that multiple mobile homes aren’t allowed on an R1 property. However, I’m now stuck because the enforcement office doesn’t seem to be taking further action. I don’t want to be “that neighbor,” but I also don’t want to see the neighborhood’s appearance (and property values) impacted by this setup.

WIBTA if I escalate this to the city council or other higher-ups? Or should I just let it go? I wish I could add a picture so you could see how close they are to me. When I asked her why she put it down close to our fence line she just said “because she can” the land has not been deeded or subdivided. It’s one owners 3 acres. I have a meeting with an attorney, but am just curious if IATAH?

Every once in a while, I would message her, just asking how she was, what she’s been up to, etc. She, for some reason, did NOT like when I did this. So 2 months ago she called for no contact, blocking me on almost everything. I think this is unfair. I felt like me checking up on her, was not wrong for me to do. I don’t understand why she got upset with me for it.

Since I had no way of contacting her, I decided to use my best friend’s phone. He is very protective of his phone, so I know he wouldn’t allow me to use it. One night I managed to go into his room and take it. Now I know, this was not good of me to do, but I really needed to text my ex.

I managed to get into his phone. I knew his password was his birthday cuz he mentioned it a while back. When I started to put in my girlfriend’s phone number, I noticed that it was already in his phone. I thought that was strange, so I clicked on her contact and saw flirty messages between the both of them.

I felt distraught. How could my “friend” do this to me. 

I texted her saying it was me, and then I asked “how could you get with my best friend behind my back?” I said how it was unreasonable and just not fair to me. After I sent the message, my roommate caught me and started yelling at me, asking why I was on his phone in the middle of the night.

I yelled back, stating it was unfair for him to get with my ex and he should end it with her. He said no and snatched his phone back, telling me to get out. I just left, not wanting to start a fight. 

I went to the nearest IHOP to grab a cup of coffee and text my mom. I didn’t give her all of the details, just asking if I could stay for the night, she said yes.

The next morning I woke up to messages from my roommate. He was saying how he’s kicking me out of the apartment and to never attempt to contact him, nor my ex ever again. I feel like this isn’t fair. I’ve known both of them for years, how can they just do this to me?

73,1gg3zgt,AITA for reacting angrily when my boyfriend finished an entire bottle of salad dressing in a 24 hour period?,"Hi everyone,
I know this sounds so silly. Yesterday I purchased a bottle (a whole, normal sized bottle) of salad dressing for the meal I was planning to make. 
For context, I am the breadwinner in my household and buy almost all groceries, pay the mortgage, etc. I have a great relationship with my partner but I just can’t shake the fact that we had such a big disagreement over something so silly. 
Anyways, I’m pretty normal with how I dress my salad, so I know that the bottle would last me at least 1-2 weeks. We go to have our meal tonight and I see that the dressing is all gone. My feeling is that my partner has just plowed through something that I purchased in 24 hours. I find it kind of greedy and unnecessary. I brought this up with him - like, “hey, can you maybe try to use less salad dressing so that this can last longer?” 
It turned into a huge argument, where he laughed in my face and said that I was “breaking his balls over salad dressing.” 
I buy most of the groceries and have had this occur many times before. Things that I purchase disappear before I can even get to them. We’ve had this discussion before. He thinks I’m being absurd over caring about a few dollars worth of dressing, I’m trying to think big picture - like hello, we don’t need to plow through food goods like that especially when I’m the one buying them.

About a year and a half ago before I even know our friends were trying to conceive we all had a discussion of what our baby names are. We both had the same #1 name  and ultimately ended the conversation with her saying there can be two kids with the same name and me saying good because I’m not changing it. (At the time I didn’t feel the need to express how long I’ve wanted the name) low and behold about a month later they pregnant and two months later they find out the gender and shout at the rooftops what the name is going to be. You guessed it…it’s the name we both wanted. 

Immediately I’m heartbroken but how am I suppose to tell someone in the middle of their pregnancy that I still want to use that name. Ultimately we don’t know if we’ll ever have a girl and I fully believe you can’t call dibs on a name. It’s just not fair. 

Well fast forward a couple months ago I’m 5 month pregnant and she now tells me I can’t use that name anymore. 

I just feel that it’s so unfair for her to go back on her word. And at the end of the day she knew we also wanted that name and it should have been a part of their decision process when naming their child. If it wasn’t, then our feelings weren’t really considered.

I just feel like one day I’ll regret not being able to use it. Like if I were to know we would end up here I would have been a whole lot more vocal about us still using the name.

We do live across the street from each other and this is a small town. Our children won’t be in the same grade at school but they will be in the same social circle. 

I also have a huge family and we have repeat names all over the place. I genuinely don’t think it’s weird and it’s the silliest thing to get worked up about someone using the same name as your child. 

We have been friends a lot longer than we have been neighbors. 

The heartbreak was less about her using the name and more about the worry of being put in the situation we are in now - her backing up and wanting us to choose a different name. I’m not upset she used the name - everyone has a right to a name. I am more heartbroken about potentially not being able to use the name.

75,1gg3bmh,AITA to ask a friend to pay for the stuff I promised to save for them? ,"Friend A, let's call him Blorbus, is doing an important project that'll affect their chances of graduating and I've saved some stuff from my past project to sell to them (I really need the money for either rent or house repair, whenever they decide to pay gets the higher priority).

I bought these materials from another mutual friend of ours, Friend B (Elk). I barely used it though because I just bought it for insurance, in case I need to replace my own materials.

I finished my project last semester (Blorbus got delayed) and we, Elk and I, agreed that we would reserve the remaining materials to Blorbus since it'll be useful. I tried contacting Blorbus multiple times this past year if they're willing to get it (my place got flooded in and I need to clear more room in my place) but they either had an occasion going on or ghosted me. The one time we did interact, I stated the price of the materials and was willing to drop it off at school so it'll be cheaper for the both of us (courier fees are pretty pricy) and they never replied back.

A week ago, Elk chatted with me because Blorbus suddenly contacted them for the materials (despite me saying I had them the last we chatted). Elk decided to drop by my place and order a courier to deliver it to Blorbus instead (it was night and Blorbus lived pretty far). I thought it was weird because I could have done it myself. After chatting a bit more, I reached a realization that Elk and Blorbus had been chatting during the periods when I tried chatting and didn't know what to make of it.

We eventually decided to add it in and Elk told me they'll tell Blorbus about the price I placed. I didn't charge for the rest but only the particular materials that could technically pay for my rent next month (which was a lot less). 

Yesterday, I contacted Blorbus again to see how it was going and brought up the materials price. I told them they could pay it to me anytime but after a while they stopped chatting once again. I felt bad so I tried messaging them again the next morning to apologize and saw they blocked me. 

I haven't told Elk about it yet as I don't want to sour their mood, but was ITA for asking about the payment? I could have just sold it to someone else and gotten a lot more compared to the price I'm selling it to Blorbus (I was selling it at the same price Elk sold it to me a year ago and the material's price have shot up an additional 10% its former price) but I wanted to honor my agreement to Elk. 

Note: The materials I bought from Elk were non-perishables. So they had no expiration, they didn't deform (they do discolor if placed beside something that can cause discoloration) and can last for a really long time if not used.

Friend A, let's call him Blorbus, is doing an important project that'll affect their chances of graduating and I've saved some stuff from my past project to sell to them (I really need the money for either rent or house repair, whenever they decide to pay gets the higher priority).

I bought these materials from another mutual friend of ours, Friend B (Elk). I barely used it though because I just bought it for insurance, in case I need to replace my own materials.

I finished my project last semester (Blorbus got delayed) and we, Elk and I, agreed that we would reserve the remaining materials to Blorbus since it'll be useful. I tried contacting Blorbus multiple times this past year if they're willing to get it (my place got flooded in and I need to clear more room in my place) but they either had an occasion going on or ghosted me. The one time we did interact, I stated the price of the materials and was willing to drop it off at school so it'll be cheaper for the both of us (courier fees are pretty pricy) and they never replied back.

A week ago, Elk chatted with me because Blorbus suddenly contacted them for the materials (despite me saying I had them the last we chatted). Elk decided to drop by my place and order a courier to deliver it to Blorbus instead (it was night and Blorbus lived pretty far). I thought it was weird because I could have done it myself.

Cost of living up here is much more expensive than I bargained for, so I am considering moving to a city in the Midwest where some of my best friends from grad school are moving as well after I get my license. That is still about a year out. It seems that the COL is much better there, I could seemingly work one job and be okay financially instead of the three I'm working here in order to make sure everything is covered.

On the face of it, makes total sense. The snag I'm running into is my mom. I love her very, very much but she is very difficult and has a lot of mental health issues that have really gotten her in trouble with her relationships and her employment. We have been pretty codependent and enmeshed for years, but I have been putting in a lot of work the past few years to break that cycle and set some boundaries so I can live my own life. She was raised by abusive parents who really didn't know how to love her and she never learned to love herself which has affected every relationship she's ever had. She is the biggest stress in my life, but I am the only one left in her life because she's alienated others and I don't think anyone deserves to be fully alone.

My little brother (31M) moved out of state, met his wife and is very happy there. I don't see him ever leaving there. My mom takes this super personally that he ran across the country to be away from her. He has learned to set those boundaries and, while he loves mom a lot, he knows there's nothing he can do for her and he is going to live his life.

My mom knows that I am considering moving about 16 hours from her (she's in the Mid Atlantic) and she's hurt because I was considering moving back to that area originally which would have made me only a few hours away from her. I realized that would not be as financially smart as moving to the midwest so I will not be going forward with that plan and so she is naturally disappointed.

I know she is emotionally manipulating me, knowingly or not (or both possibly), by talking about how she wants me to go because that is what is best for me, but she was upset when she mentioned she might move there (she's followed me to two different states at this point) and I didn't jump at the idea. She doesn't want me to not go just for her, but she sees everyone around her that is her age being surrounded by their kids and grandkids.

While Matt was raised in the common 2 parent upper middle-class household. We have lived very different lives with different values and experiences. We met through my niece which was weird at first because he came to pick up his niece from a sleepover, but I didn't know him, and I wasn't letting this girl go with a stranger. After everything was confirmed and settled things just went from there. I'm very introverted and he's extroverted so we started friendly then got friendlier and he proposed. Now you would think we would have problems with our families with our differences, things that include skin tone, but everything managed to fall into place. My biggest fear was my brothers and cousins wouldn't like him being that I'm the only girl and youngest of 5 and all my brothers and cousins are bulky and tall. So, I walked him into meeting the crazy that is my family, and they hit it off (thank you anime and gaming). Meeting his family felt weird and different to me but they are the nicest people that I can see so far.

Now to my problem I don't have the best view on marriage, and I have always been careful with money so I don't see why we can't just go to the courthouse then have a family barbeque to celebrate. At first Matt was on my side saying we could use that money to buy a house or go on a honeymoon and everything was fine. Then we started telling everyone the plan and now everyone has an opinion and none of them are what I want. Matts mom who well call Debra wants her son to have a church wedding with their pastor like her eldest son did. I'm religious but not to the point of wanting a church wedding. My mom we can call DeeDee wants me to have a wedding because she didn't have one.

My sibling (15) and I (18) get along generally, but they're bad at understanding social cues, and I'm bad at changing my tone of voice, so we get our wires crossed sometimes. (before you ask, yes we're both autistic)

So, they came into my room earlier so I could de-tangle their hair. They recently grew it long, and I keep mine short. I did so, but it was a bit tricky since they didn't have a proper hairbrush. I thought we had one at home, but apparently we don't. 

They were annoyed when I commented on the hairbrush, and said they couldn't afford a better one. I thought they had some money. We both get an allowance, and as far as I know they don't spend wildly.  (Money to cover transport & food at school, new clothes, etc. I also get child benefit, and have since I was 16, and work). Generally, I spend my leftover money on random necessities that aren't part of the communal stuff.  

They got upset, and said that they were saving their money. Reasonable. They also said that they were 'just a baby' and felt like whenever I entered a new stage of life, they were dragged along with me. Example: when I got a phone, they did too, when I opened a bank account they did too, when I started making my own meals, they did too, even though they were younger. I was a bit perplexed, and said that I bought my own skin/hair care stuff at their age since it was non-essential, and since I wanted stuff that wasn't shared. 

They got more upset, and said that I did it voluntarily. I asked (earnestly, but I doubt it came off that way) didn't they want to be independent and take initiative. They said weren't 18 like me, and weren't an adult. I tried to say that growing up happens gradually, not overnight when you turn 18.

So, they came into my room earlier so I could de-tangle their hair. They recently grew it long, and I keep mine short. I did so, but it was a bit tricky since they didn't have a proper hairbrush. I thought we had one at home, but apparently we don't. 

They were annoyed when I commented on the hairbrush, and said they couldn't afford a better one. I thought they had some money. We both get an allowance, and as far as I know they don't spend wildly.  (Money to cover transport & food at school, new clothes, etc. I also get child benefit, and have since I was 16, and work). Generally, I spend my leftover money on random necessities that aren't part of the communal stuff.  

They got upset, and said that they were saving their money. Reasonable. They also said that they were 'just a baby' and felt like whenever I entered a new stage of life, they were dragged along with me. Example: when I got a phone, they did too, when I opened a bank account they did too, when I started making my own meals, they did too, even though they were younger. I was a bit perplexed, and said that I bought my own skin/hair care stuff at their age since it was non-essential, and since I wanted stuff that wasn't shared. 

They got more upset, and said that I did it voluntarily. I asked (earnestly, but I doubt it came off that way) didn't they want to be independent and take initiative. They said weren't 18 like me, and weren't an adult. I tried to say that growing up happens gradually, not overnight when you turn 18. 

I'm pretty sure I upset them, though they say that they're fine.",0.0,0.9997202157974243,1,0

I don't have any privacy since we share the same room and the toilet are in our room. She even gave my sweater to our cousin without my permission. One summer  night I was really tired and needed a lot of sleep.

She suddenly turned off the fan to charge her phone. I yelled at her and she said "" It's my fan I can do whatever I want. Sleep like this"" ( mine was broken) I unplug the charger and she screams waking my older brother and sister.

I explained them what she did but they didn't care. They yelled "" GIVE HER CHARGER BACK"" I tried to explain them that she'll turn the fan off.to charge her phone but again,  they didn't care.

My mom woke up and I explained and she told my sister she was wrong but my sister still wanted to plug her phone because "" it's not her fault if my fan is broken."" My mom looked at me and said "" go back to sleep it'll take 5 minutes to plug the-"" 

I interrupted her by screaming "" You don't give a f about me. As long as she doesn't annoy YOU , you don't do anything to defend ME"" I don't remember what I said after but my mom decided to take her phone away.

","For context, I’ve been living with my hellish roommate for 10 months and have never really settled into the apartment due to the ongoing drama. I met her on a facebook group and she seemed very normal at first, but I have since learned that she is anything but normal. She has never once cleaned the spaces in the apartment, doesn’t do any of the household maintenance such as taking out the trash or putting it to the curb, and has gotten in nearly physical altercations with our landlord. She has our landlord blocked over text message and cannot have a civil conversation with her regarding anything, so every household matter has had to be handled by me. Basically, there have been countless issues in the house and we have never become friends.

When we moved in, I lived in my own apartment so I brought pretty much everything- all living room decor, tv, kitchenware, nearly everything in the house is mine. 
My boyfriend and I are moving in together and managed to find a place we loved that is available immediately. I decided to take the financial loss for paying double rent because living here is stressful, and I’m getting the keys on friday. My landlord is not planning on renewing her lease this winter anyways, because she’s put my landlord through hell also. 

My dilemma is the fact that everything in the house is mine. I’m planning on selling some of my items this weekend and then gradually moving to the new apartment. The house will be empty and she will have to continue to live here for 2 months with no couch, tv, or living room decor. I really don’t feel bad because of how awful she’s been to me, but I feel a need to pull back on moving out because I know she is not gonna be happy about it. I’m kinda worried about her retaliating.

Mike and I have two children C (8M) and G (6F) who are heavily involved in baseball/softball. These games have us traveling all over the county and sometimes outside of the county for games. Over the years we have invited Jared and Maggie to many games close to their home, birthday parties for the kids, and out to eat with us as a family and they never come to anything.

On our birthdays neither Jared or Maggie even text us happy birthday. This has been a pattern over mine and Mike's marriage, and he will never say anything about it. First because he is very passive and quiet while Jared is outspoken and angry, second because Jared is both of our bosses at work and we don't want any issues (yes we all work together which is just the cherry on top 🍒) 

So on to current day, Maggie is having a birthday diner at their house and will be inviting her side of the family (who have very strong overwhelming personalities) and I don't want to go. Even thinking about going gives me anxiety, however I don't want to cause issues between my husband and his brother and our job.

My brother and sister-in-law are hosting a culturally significant birthday party for their son soon. We’ve all been helping in different ways to make this event special.

The two of them stopped talking and would only talk through me and as a 13-14 year old at the time that hurt. So last year I went to my dad’s for Christmas and a lot happened.
