0,1gg7uqi,AITA for choosing to no longer wear a bra,"Context, I am a 22 year old genderfluid afab person, living with my parents. I also have a skin condition called HS, or Hidradenitis suppurativa/acne inversa, which I was diagnosed with earlier this year.

This morning I was talking to my parents about something random and my dad noticed one of my HS sores on my shoulder and asked what happened (he often mistakes them for injuries). I explained it was a flare up of my HS triggered from my bra straps and that I get them quite often, they're just normally covered by my shirts, and showed him the identical sores on my other shoulder. 

My mom commented that we'd have to experiment with a different type of fabric for my bras to get rid of the irritation, and I told her I mostly fix the problem by just not wearing bras at all, reserving them for outfits or situations that require them (working out, going to a special event, or wearing a shirt/dress where one would need to wear a bra)

When I said that I got disappointed looks from both parents and my mom said ""well not wearing a bra is not an option"" and I just said ""agree to disagree"" and excused myself because I needed to run an errand. 

Now I'm wondering if I'm an AH for choosing to not wear a bra. I'm one of those people who believes women should not be required to wear bras ever, and that breasts should not be sexualized so much. The social constructs around womens chests are ridiculous. But I also recognize that I have a moderately large chest, and my parents are typically very modest people, so maybe me being braless makes them uncomfortable.
