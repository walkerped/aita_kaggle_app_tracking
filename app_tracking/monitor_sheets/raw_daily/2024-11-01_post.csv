0,1ggyhlk,AITA Monthly Open Forum November 2024: Thank You!,"#Keep things civil. Rules still apply.

In the spirit of the month, we’d like to express our gratitude to our users for (almost) another year. Sure, it’s not always sunshine and lollipops, but overall, we still get to interact with some pretty cool people. It may be hard to believe, but not every Modmail we get is negative.

We have some that take the time to consistently report things that should be reported. In case anyone wants to remain anonymous, I’ll leave usernames out here, but we know who you are. Whether it’s the good faith reporting of trolls/AI posts, or consistently being on the lookout for the posts that involve minors and sexual content. We appreciate you.

I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention our Bot Hunters. We’ve noticed how consistent you are, and your accuracy is pretty spot on! We are truly grateful for your help in spotting those bots. Particularly on New Bot Hatching Days, where it seems a bunch just pop up all at once. If you’re interested in joining Team Bot Hunter, drop us a [ModMail message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAmItheAsshole&subject=&message=)!

To those that celebrate Thanksgiving this month, enjoy! To those that are in parts of the world where it isn’t a thing (or if you really just don’t care), enjoy whatever it is you’re into!
